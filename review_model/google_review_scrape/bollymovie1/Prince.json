[{"review":"one of the best bollywood films ever made..... one of the finest bollywood film got flop just because it was ahead of its time and people were unable to understand the concept of the film.... brilliant and heart touching music,   awesome songs and a nice n non copied story,  i still listen to prince's songs and they r still my favourite hits of all time.....bollywood today has become nothing but copy of south indian films, hollywood stories n action copied.....growing nepotism.....and stupid remixes of old songs (not all.....obviously)...and thats it.......this is the summary of today's bollywood industry.....where r new stories guys ?......if u all r unable to create a story then just start searching for talents.....indians can come up with a superb story....yeah but for that our industry needs to reduce nepotism......give equal chances man....for now lets just pray for a good future of bollywood....i'll be more than happy if my comment makes a difference........even i can contribute a bunch of stories written by me.....\n\n\np.s. good films like stree, sanju etc are excluded from the list......","label":0},{"review":"prince is a stylish, intelligent action movie. i remember the time its promos were played across televisions. i got so excited and always wanted to see it, cause it felt like my type of movie. sadly, couldn't get to see it on the big screen, but this year, i saw it and loved it to the core!
