[{"review":"this movie is intense. \n\nit's not for everybody.\n\nwhether it comes to love, passion or pain, everything is shown in the most raw form possible. it's beautiful and heartbreaking at once.\nthe chemistry between ram & leela is charged. their eyes speak when words don't. \n\nthere's nothing that i don't love about this film. except the end, it was tragic.\n\nthat said, this will always be my favorite bollywood film.","label":0},{"review":"love it! all the things that i expect from a bollywood movie. love ranveer, deepika's acting and bhansali's perfect direction. yes, the ending is not perfect but hey its the whole experience that makes me love this movie. all the dances, music, costumes, sets, locations - what else could you ask for. the best movie ever","label":0},{"review":"a must watch movie. sanjay leela bhansali proved that bollywood can make more romantic/action movie then hollywood. and again ranveer & deepika show their talents. script,

movie. although deepika and ranveer's performances and looks are ravishing, movie lacks certain logical points! \nso if you're up to watching a bollywoodstyle epic dramatic love story, and simply feel love,  it's the right choice...","label":0},{"review":"100/10. this film is the best film someone can ever see. it made me cry a lot. anyone who views this,  recommend u to see the film its awesome.

bansali for making this masterpiece!","label":0},{"review":"the film is loosely based on the conception of romeo and juliet. the only difference is the leading characters- ram rajari (ranvir singh) and leela sanera (deepika padukone) have stronger and bolder approaches. the romance is not on trust love, it is all sex. the climax leaves you feeling guilty, it is so touchy, that you be like, \"nahi! nahi! maro mat. rajari aur sanera ek ho gaye!\" but you know- a william shakespeare tragedy is a classic.","label":0},{"review":"actually when i saw the kiss scene i completely lost my
