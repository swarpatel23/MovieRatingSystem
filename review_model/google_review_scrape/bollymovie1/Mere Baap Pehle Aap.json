[{"review":"it is based on commercially successful malayalam comedy 'ishtam'. it's a typical priyadarshan movie with actors like akshye khanna, om puri, paresh rawal. the father-son duo of akshye khanna and paresh rawal has great chemistry (especially the cheeky loud punches of akshye) and om puri's supporting role was even funnier. it's first half was fun. second half added an emotional layer to the story. it doesn't have a 'great' soundtrack but i liked \"maine hawaii ke patron pe likha hai\". although a different kind of story of that time(2008) but all in all it was a \"fresh comedy\".","label":0},{"review":"i don't understand why the ratings here are so less...has imdb even seen the whole film...it may have a crazy name have but it has a great soothing environment, a full package of laughter and mixture of emotions; it also portrayed the beautiful relationship that exists between a father and a son maybe not in the desired way or the way people are used to it but it did touch our hearts...just want to say one last thing don't judge this film on the basis of this stupid rating go have a watch on your own i am sure you won't be disappointed..","label":0},{"review":"the whole movie is very beautiful💃especially the acting of shobnaji as prof.anuradha she is so pretty & graceful😍i see, thiz movie again and again & i never bored to watch thiz.","label":0},{"review":"i love this 😍movie whenever i watch this film i never ever bored becze....itz just simplicity and just few moments had with them 😅...and background score also marvellous😍🤗💘💞","label":0},{"review":"i love to watch again and again this movie... best comic acting of paresh rawal, om puri and archana puran singh. two generation's love stories ....","label":0},{"review":"i dont how this movie got such a low rating... \nit's a damn good movie man","label":0},{"review":"askay khanna & parash rawal awesome actor . it's a great movie.","label":0},{"review":"one of the most underrated film!!\nthis film is amazing ❤️","label":0},{"review":"superb.. a complete package of laughter","label":0},{"review":"cant believe it is so under rated...... it is a fantastic family comedy drama movie !!","label":0},{"review":"really an entertaining movie, excellent acting by all major and minor actors.","label":0},{"review":"superb movie akshay's movies alwyas has full of comedy chilled","label":0},{"review":"very nive movie . comedy are very very good","label":0},{"review":"i luvv this movie since have been seeing in theatre","label":0},{"review":"this is a very funny movie.rating must be 8 plus.","label":0},{"review":"one of the most enjoyable movies ever !","label":0},{"review":"i liked the film and i like priyadarshan movies","label":0},{"review":"very  enjoyable movie","label":0},{"review":"a family movie i enjoyed","label":0},{"review":"waste of time, really dont like","label":0},{"review":"best movie sir 😂😂😂","label":0},{"review":"a family move nice","label":0},{"review":"i am not. this film open","label":0}]
