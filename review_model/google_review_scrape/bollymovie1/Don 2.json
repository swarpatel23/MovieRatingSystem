[{"review":"i have really misunderstood this movie although i liked it a lot when it came in 2011. i could at that time not understand that srk's character is written in a way that makes us feel he's overacting while actually he didn't. one of the major reasons for watching this movie was the stylish action that had caught my attention from the trailers. the car chase sequence is one of the best ones i've seen in an indian movie till date. the plot is full of twists and turns, and a lot of that makes sense now. the film wasn't even a little bit of bad that i felt initially it was at times. this is one of the best action-thriller movies by bollywood in the last few years and is a must watch. i'm glad i know understand it fully.\n\n9/10.","label":0},{"review":"one of the best crime thriller of india. its not a mystery, just a robbery is planned and executed in the whole movie but then also it don't let our eyes miss a single scene. this movie is really comparable to hollywood with very good  screenplay, acting and action. i suggest you to watch this movie if you are a fan of crime thrillers. also shahrukh and priyanka are very best as always, they are the representative of bollywood in the international audience.","label":0},{"review":"it's  a complete stylized action thriller  movie. it's  my type of film thats why its my fav film of bollywood. srk as don is damn awesome. no can match his level of acting. the movie looks like a hollywood movie. the entry of don is one of the best entry of any hero in bollywood. the twists and turns will not allow you to distract from a single scene. to understand  the story one has to watch don 1. india has a lack of this kind of perfect films. indian audiences  don't  understand  good films. i hope they will be making don 3 soon.","label":0},{"review":"the best actor you would ever witnessüôèüôè ... the style and attitude that shah rukh khan carries throughout the movie is awesome .... \n\npeople who doesn't have a good taste in acting and movies would not like it üòèüòè\nas we all know that srk is the king of bollywood and he maintained that royalty of his character ... the movie is awesome and you must go for it üíóüíóüíó","label":0},{"review":"wow !!
