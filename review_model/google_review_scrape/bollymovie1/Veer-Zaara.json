[{"review":"it is an absolute masterpiece! the script, acting and music are all phenomenal. it is filled with intense emotions that will leave even a stone hearted person - teary eyed. \n       it touches a number of themes including the india-pakistan relations, gender equality, life of a prisoner, cultural diversity, and weaves it all together with the central theme of true love. \n     the selflessness and unconditional nature of love, coupled with the presence of solace in a lover's mind even in the midst of unbearable pain, leaves the viewer stunned. the biggest and the most beautiful take away from the movie is - true love, even if it is unrequited, never hurts provided you love truly.\n\njust like the tale of eternal love that it presents, this movie shall remain evergreen.","label":0},{"review":"this is the only movie which makes me emotional to a greater extent as i have always preferred to watch this in bright day light on a huge screen coz this immerse me

iconic scenes of the bollywood world. yash chopra has added the flavor of punjab which sums up extremely and makes one damn emotional. the village part of the movie is so heartbreaking and

been the aura of this iconic romantic drama.","label":0},{"review":"it is the best movie full of romance and sacrifice. the script, music, performances and the suspense, everything is extraordinary.
