[{"review":"i had watched this movie long back but on tv with lots of advertisements, household work breaks, basically meaning did not watch continuously.\nfinally watched again at netflix in october 2018 and i absolutely loved it. don't understand why this movie has low ratings everywhere. it's very beautiful, very emotional and heart touching movie. all 3 stars kajol, kareena and arjun have acted brilliantly. the kids acting is also superb. even though it's a remake of english movie, still it does not get boring even for a minute. there is too much of emotion and crying but isn't that we indian audience actually love in movies. i cried almost half of the movie. writing review for an 8 year old movie sounds weird but i loved the movie and couldn't resist posting the review.","label":0},{"review":"i personally loved the movie.it was an unusual plot, something that was different from the normal hero-heroine love story based movies.the songs were great.the movie could leave anyone in tears,as in the scenes when maya was admitted to the hospital and  when her children badly missed her were  heart renching.even the ending part was perfect.loved it!!!","label":0},{"review":"i like the film. it was decent and emotional film. i don't know why some people found it bad and boring. their choice but it liked it. it was emotional and nice. posting this review after so long. after watching bad reviews decided to review it. if you like family and emotional film then watch it","label":0},{"review":"the best movie ever.so emotional that can make anyone cry. kareena kapoor,kajol ,etc.had done fabulous job . one of my favourite movie.i just really loved it.","label":0},{"review":"watched this movie today... excellent theme oriented one... unfortunate situation is the story line here... super direction..all are acted superb... especially kids... practical story with emotional touch... i was almost into tears... a must watch for family oriented person n kids...","label":0},{"review":"i love this movie. no matter how many times i have watch this movie my eyes fill with tears and never get bored. it's such a awesome and underrated movie.","label":0},{"review":"i've never cried watching a movie like i did with this one. wonderful movie with actors that went all out and did their best.\n\ni salute kajol for killing that role❤️","label":0},{"review":"the movie is superb all the actors has acted brilliantly, i don't know why this movie is not famous as it should be. i should say one of the most underrated indian movie.","label":0},{"review":"first, i watched this movie in 2011 when i was a kid,.. i was greatly impressed.. now ,after 6years again got the chance to check into it..","label":0},{"review":"such a great and emotional movie. loved it, made me cry.","label":0},{"review":"i cried...just cried whilewatching this movie.\nfull of emotions ,love ,care \nacting 10/10","label":0},{"review":"i can't stop wtch this movie....its alwys mkes me cry...i luv this movie so mch.....😢😢☺👍👍","label":0},{"review":"i loved to watch this movie again and again. heart touching ...","label":0},{"review":"this is the only movie that has made me cry. i love it!","label":0},{"review":"i just watched this movie on netflix & it made me emotional. just an emotionally influential character maya played (kajol).","label":0},{"review":"omg i love this movie brought tears to my eyes","label":0},{"review":"love this movie so much \nso emotional couldnt stop crying","label":0},{"review":"thoroughly enjoyed this movie....and cried like an idiot in every scene.","label":0},{"review":"masterpiece....i juss love it...n i cried alot while watching it...but it's amazing.....😍😍😍😍😘😘😘","label":0},{"review":"soft and cool movie ... mostly i like","label":0},{"review":"mind blowing  acting by kajol and arjun rampal.","label":0},{"review":"heart touching film","label":0},{"review":"wonderful:\nacting\nstory","label":0},{"review":"this movie made me to cry,super movie,😢","label":0},{"review":"awesome movie 😍😍","label":0},{"review":"good old tearjerking family movie😄😢","label":0},{"review":"it's nice it's old 2010 film","label":0},{"review":"coolie indian film up to expectations","label":0},{"review":"one time movie","label":0},{"review":"not very good....... just okkk","label":0},{"review":"student off the year 2","label":0},{"review":"do to bring","label":0}]
