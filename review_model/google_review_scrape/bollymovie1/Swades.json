[{"review":"i saw it in 2007 for the first time and since then it is undoubtedly one of my favorite movie. ashutosh sir never miss a chance to give us the best of movies. all the actors have done a great job in it. be it mohan bhargav (my favorite character superbly performed) or geeta (beautiful and simple girl) or kaveri amma. the story beautifully conveys the messages leaving you speechless with emotions and tears.\nthere are several instances where you can feel the powerful acting. one of my favorite is when mohan visits haridasji and while coming back seeing a small boy selling water in kulhad decides to buy a glass from him despite being an nri. another favorite one is while everyone sitting at school location on dusshra on being asked about the conditions in the u.s. how meticulously mohan explains that one can't judge the country on the basis of varied culture and traditions. bullseye!!","label":0},{"review":"mind blowing movie. easily one of my favorites. i like that slight dab of patriotism in this movie along with the will to progress our nation (countryside). i'm falling short of words just to describe how good this movie is. brought tears to my eyes. and just to show how much i üíï  this film, let me tell you that this tops @ 1 among my all-time favorite bollywood movies. this is a cult classic movie \nand a must watch for all the indians. great job

nothing ever can replace it. every indian must watch this movie. this movie has the possibility to bring a fundamental change in one's mind.\n\n ashutosh sir did an outstanding job by making this film and starring srk, gayatri joshi and every other casting actor. this was srk's first time playing a different role other than a mad psychotic lover or masala comedian, and he excelled in his job. this movie is one of the best indian films ever to be made.\n\nif you haven't watched this, go to netflix or in another movie website and watch it! i guarantee you you will love this masterpiece.","label":0},{"review":"look on what day i re-watched this outstanding movie. swades is a film that every indian should watch no matter what. patriotic movies generally, ask you to respect your land by showing facts and figures or may be our achievements but this particular movie persuades and convinces you to love india even after considering all its flaws. extraordinary story, brilliant piece of direction by gowarikar, simply great performance by srk (one of his most admired performances) and a heartfelt album by rahman makes this film a must-watch for all age groups. it will surely leave a wide smile on your face as it ends. rating: 4.25/5 !!","label":0},{"review":"one of the best film srk has ever done..doesn‚Äôt matter how many time i warch it..it keeps on giving me goosebumps everytime i see it. it‚Äôs something which bollywood has stop producing now a days..it teaches what meaning of true patriotism is..it traches to get up and try to find solutions for problems around you by yourself instead of looking at govt or someone else. decade old movie but still relevant and i think it will always be. i expect bollywood to make more movies like this.","label":0},{"review":"there are movies and then there is swades! i guess am too biased since i have watched it innumerable timesüòä \n\nsrk never like this before or after.  every person who

\nall in one, everything is perfect about this movie.","label":0},{"review":"it's one of my favourite movie. actors acting were too good. dialogues were motivational . social message was there . i

settled in abroad . when they come in india they show too much of tantrum and attitude as if they are not indians . i have seen my realatives i don't care of that dam. they are also indian after all.  they are going to abroad only because for extra income purpose . for dollars and in pounds income purpose .","label":0},{"review":"there are movies that keep you spellbound with their mind-bending visuals, script, and storytelling. then there are some of them that challenge you on not in a condescending way but in an emphatic way. swades belongs to the latter category. it asks you to reevaluate your priorities and perspective as an individual - whether you think a big picture is important or small efforts are relevant. it is simple, heartwarming, and emotional. not necessarily a patriotic movie though!","label":0},{"review":"this is a simple yet a great movie. it has colours of patriotism along with the harsh truth and reality. how much i like that he was successful in producing

emotional connect fused with some heart touching melodies. it is inspiring yet falls short of catching the pulse. the actors stood out, espl the actor playing kaveri amma‚Äôs character. a romanticized
