[{"review":"good movie. whoever made this knew how to make vampires scary. it's not that gory either so for those who don't like that stuff shouldn't have to worry about it. it felt pretty drawn out but it was fine with the plot. i definitely recommend this.","label":0},{"review":"it‚Äôs a great and chilling movie about a town that has 30 days of no sunlight during winter got invaded by vampires. gory and violent; not for the faint hearted. not your typical lame vampire movie. josh hartnett is great in this one!","label":0},{"review":"excellent movie! keeps you on the edge of your seat! vampires much better than fear the walking dead. these vampires are fast, sneaky, smart and blood thirsty. will definitely keep you entertained!","label":0},{"review":"these vamps don't twinkle. they take over a town in alaska and go on a human-hunting spree when the sun goes down for months at a time. probably the only decent spiritual successor to nosferatu in that it depicts wholly inhuman vampires, not humans with colored contacts and cheap fangs. worth a watch if you want an intense vampire story.","label":0},{"review":"loved it from start to finish!
