[{"review":"dil chahta hai...my all time fvt...3 types love  showed by 3 bloosom frs. i think sid is right in his own way ; he loved truly without self .although society may oppose. he has no any harm thought. love is not sin atall with no bar of age status caste religion complex language regionality natlity high low level. love creates from deep heart and soul only.but his shorttemper nature broke connection with akash.actually he wrongly took akash joke. akash had no idea of love , he is pure. \nsameer : the peculiar fickle mind  turned 2 a real lover & also gave good msg 2 youth.\nakash casanova is my fvt character.  bcoz he realized enchanted discovered  love theme ...the true love.  they had good friendship  eachother.   this film can be watched many times anywhere  anytime..masterpiece  of  farhan. personally i watched 16 times only till today.aamir as akash fantastic look dacing getup .my heart cryed having watched his emotional look.l m glad as he choosed akash role instead of sid role .l found this more interesting than other  two. farhan idea proved as wrong.\nmusical track thrilled me.. good narration . akash proposed dramatically. so excitement. one thing if matter is all abt propose so quickly perform it at right time. never delay....  nt mainstream movie  still an iconic 4ever.  the moment  sid lost her lady love and all frs became very sad ..very sensitive moment . age no matter but sincerity impt...nice movie ..love is sensitive emotional natural part of life . any way though  pvt still  true love  mandatory.   i learnt  many voluable  things  from it .  i must watch it many times  .  plz regularly  touch with this outstanding movie  ..each time after watching  dch i found myself very stressfree relaxed tensionfree bindas. i think this is the real charm effect of dch.that's why i can watch it 10k times without feel boaring.make ur friendship special with dch plz guys!! preity is so cute bubbly.aamirkhan and  akshye khanna  both r very goodlooking charming and dynamic personality...\ntake care . good luck 2 all viewers . shanti shanti shanti. namaste. siddharrth  tum aur main hamesha............","label":0},{"review":"undoubtedly way ahead of its time. though upon releasing in 2001 it was able to achieve very word of mouth popularity especially in urban areas. grabbed some awards and became a cult classic as in farhan akhtar's debut directorial. the part which i liked most is the casting of the movie. aamir, saif, akshay were somehow a strange combination back then. but they turned out to be one hell of a trio! this coming of age, mature friendship story became so legendary that they came up with another one with the same concept: znmd! that too was very good, but to me dch is the clear winner here. nowadays, i have no idea why farhan akhtar goes more with acting and keeps himself from being such an awesome director!","label":0},{"review":"definitely any1 can go 4r d movie. lots of things feelings r related with every scenes of d movie. how with tym emotional n mental values change r  well portrayed here by 3 talented actor over d writings of farhaan akhtar.friendship is d real treasure of ur lyf,u can live without family but not without true friend/s. the film might rekeased in 2001 but shows us d actual mirror of our current society. value love friendship n ur real feelings,thats what u can learn from this coming on age movie.","label":0},{"review":"amir as - akash\nsaif - sameer\nakshay khanna - siddharth\npreety as-shalini\nwhat a

milestone to bollywood back in the 2000s with this movie. with an eclectic mix of romance and post-adolescence plot along with the character's wittingly hilarious postures, this blockbuster

visited all the locations of goa which were shot in this movie. in 2001 we seven friends planned goa trip after watching this movie. all the songs were played on auto reverse cassette player non stop in my friends esteem car.way ahead of its time, the cast, direction and on set recording of dialouges, no dubbing i think, make it class apart. hatts off to farhan akhhtar for making such a wonderful movie.","label":0},{"review":"this is my all time favorite movie! i must have seen it at least 10 times!!\nsaif ali khan just steals the show in this! it's funny, emotional, showcases the bond between

freshness. you will watch it in 2018 or 2030 or 2050, you can't say that this movie is old, that is the best part of this movie.\ni think it is way ahead of its time when it released in 2001, that's why people at that time criticized that the youth seen in this movie is too urbanized, that's why it was semi hit at box office.\nif it released today it will be a blockbuster.\na movie that changed
