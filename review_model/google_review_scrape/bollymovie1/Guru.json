[{"review":"i don't know what tooks me so long to watch this movie.it's just outstanding.the performance of abhishek sir is just outstanding. well the main lead of the story guru bhai just inspired me a lot.\n\"change with time or else change time.\"\nhe just showed what a dreamt is meant to be .the sound tracks of this movie is just amazing. you will mesmerise it even after the movie ends.this movie also teach us what a relationship is meant to be.as a couple you not only share happiness together but also shares the hardships,pain and sufferings together.\n\"dream requires soundless sleep to see whereas aim requires sleepless night to achieve.\"\npersonally i don't think any words could seldom describe the brilliance of this movie.it was just awesome.","label":0},{"review":"it's really too good movie . who says that abhishek bachchan don't have acting skills he has played this dhirubhai ambani role very beautifully. actors acting were too good and realistic . this movie is about ambani family biography . that how they had utilise their inteldgience and they have achieve success . climax scene was very inspiring and motivating . his father was criticising him though he was son of maths teacher and he failed in maths and his mother and brother was motivating him and his journey begins from turkey he was doing job as salesman. we had learned something from this movie that we should never losse hope in our life . if someone trying to demotivate us you should always avoid that person because you should think that person is megalomaniac and oversmart. if someone is motivating to you then you should follow their steeps. songs were too good. but i didn't understand one thing that why they haven't show mukesh ambani and anil ambani .","label":0},{"review":"this movie has been my favourite, don't know exactly, how many times i have watched it..  and everytime it seems so fresh and so so inspiring, the acting of abhishek bachchan is so impeccable such
