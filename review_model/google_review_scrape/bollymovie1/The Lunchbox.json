[{"review":"lunch box  movie review\n-yogikrishnan pillai\n\n\n\nhave you ever seen a movie and after watching it you just need some time to process what are you feeling or what do you want from life,this movie made me do that,\nthis movie pulls each and every string of your heart.i procrastinated this movie for a very long time but now i regret it, i wish i had seen it before.\nthis movie was directorial debut of ritesh batra.the screenplay and this magnificent story was written by the same person.\nthe story feels authentic like it could happen with anyone that we see on daily basis. the thing that holds everything was the story...though there was not too much to play with but ritesh batra has spun this story so well that everyone can somehow connect to this story.while watching you will realize one thing that you will be anticipating the arrival of the lunchbox more then the characters.one thing i can assure that you will root for two of the main characters to come together,when you get so invested in a story thats when you know the screenplay work is on point.\nnow lets talk about the acting work which is absolutely beautiful and awe- inspiring.irfan khan who plays the role of sajaan who is almost more then 50 yrs old or less then that but he is old who is about to retire from his job and he has only few weeks,but there enters or another character shaikh played by nawazuddin siddque the new age actor who has done the best he can do with his character. shaikh is the new replacement for sajaans job.our other lead nimrat kaur who plays the character illa with absolute ease and poise,she plays the role of a housewife who is desperately trying to get her husbands attention for a very long time but is unsuccessful in doing so but is guided by a lady mrs deshpande who lives upstairs,there isnt any scene in the movie showing this character played by bharti archrekar,somehow the two communicate with each other from their windows and help each other out.so the story isnt gripping or some kind of thriller its just a simple story of how we as humans need to connect with people,how we constantly need someone to hold us and tell us that everything will be alright.the characters are written so beautifully that u forget that its fictional characters ...you root for them somehow get invested in their story. the dialogues like ‚Äúsometimes wrong trains lead to right paths‚Äù or ‚Äúi think we forget things if we have no one to tell them to‚Äù is so alluring.the dialogues written feel so true to nature that if i was in their positions i would have said the same thing..it is really amazing how with so little to work on they create.. which is indian cinemas best dialogues.nothing is wrong with this movie everything is perfect the background ,lights are so damn good that you feel like its happening in reality.the background scores fill your heart with emotions.\nthe nuances and subtle human nature is captured with so much perfection that it feels like too good to be true.this movie is fantastic and i guess everyone in some or the other way can connect to this movie it captures how vulnerable humans can be when they dont have anyone.one thing i like about the opening sequence is how the director plays with your mind i really liked ,i thought it was innovative. im sure everyone will appreciate this movie as i do. do watch it with your friends and family. indain cinema still has hope kudos to ritesh batra. see we as audience do not just want slapstick comedy or action sometimes we need a story to it all together.i believe that a movie can work with the masses even is the lack action and comedy.after all life is just story of everyone which is yet to be discovered.\non a scale of one to ten\n9.6/10","label":0},{"review":"watched the movie on a saturday a bit through streaming netflix on television and the remaining on the mobile .. such an engaging movie.\nsuperb screenplay. \nnimrat is believable and her mom's conversation with her on the day of her husband's death, a revelation.\nirfan has gotten into the charecter beautifully. so many little details in the movie are endearing..like when he's seen walking to his home in nasik with an old vip suitcase; a question by the children playing on the streets as to why is he here now; the choice of nimrat's wardrobe..the details are many.\nrefreshing movie and watchable many times because of the depth in screenplay.","label":0},{"review":"delightful and revealing story of life in mumbai. the lunchbox service is transported to that of intrigue with gastronomic and tender exchanges. getting old, ill and retiring with still so much to offer, more skills than those coming up behind you. the wife reflects many young beautiful women whose husband rejects them for lust. this feeling of being unwanted and trying to entice the husband back aligns with the older man feeling unattractive . beautiful film","label":0},{"review":"lunchbox is one of the few rare gems in today's bollywood industry when the mainstream films are busy making \"what sells\" with their cloying motifs. \nlunchbox with its cinematography, direction, screenplay and almost every other element paints a truly vibrant story with palpable emotions that transcends through the screen and imprints onto one's heart. watching this movie was an immensely satisfying experience.","label":0},{"review":"sophisticated cinema! you needn't hide behind bright lightings, magnificient buglows, huge casting and a forced glamour  when you have a powerful content. the lunchbox proves it. this is a story of bottled up emotions that find their way to ears eager to listen through a lunchbox delivered mistakenly. this story of ela and sajaan is simple yet powerful to its best. worth it anytime!","label":0},{"review":"first time i saw a romance movie without a single song from bollywood & this is really amazing. the roal of irfan
