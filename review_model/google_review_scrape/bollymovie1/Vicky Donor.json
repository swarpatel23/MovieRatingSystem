[{"review":"this movue is just great. ayushman khurana ia charming. the movie gave beautiful messages.\n1. sperm dination is not bad as seen by indian society. you can actually give life to a parent who ia dreaming about children but can't have that. \n2. marrying a divorce ia no big deal. after all it might not be her fault. \n3. inter cast marriage. bong girl married punjabi boy. opposite culture but when you love nothing matters.\n4. don't lie to your partner. you might think you are protecting them from the truth. but they has the right to know the truth. \n5. if you can't have kids, you can always adopt one. you will give life to a soul and can raise as your own. \n\nin a nutshell brilliant movie. everyone must watch it at least once.","label":0},{"review":"hello\ni have heard

movie","label":0},{"review":"first of all, the movie gives a special social message. except this message the movie fully contains with emotion, romanticism and the love chemistry between yami and ayushman was fabulous. i specially like yami. not she is my favourite actress but when i watch her movie i become her fan. she was also fantastic and gorgeous in kaabil also. i just like her. and about ayushmann, i don't know what talent is in him, he is  continuously choosing a different type of contents, most of them are great. i think after aamir khan, he will receive the \"perfectionist\" title before his name.","label":0},{"review":"vicky donor is a 2012 indian romantic comedy film directed by shoojit sircar and produced by actor john abraham.[11] it stars ayushmann khurrana, yami
