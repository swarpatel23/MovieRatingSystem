[{"review":"after watching this movie i can say that imdb sucks!!!!!!!!!!!! \ni loved each aspect and scene in this movie, there is nothing to criticise in this movie\nsonam kapoor is gorgeous not just in looks but also in terms of acting, imraan rocks both and rest whole cast is also amazing. even in the the serious times, comedy isn't missed. all songs are equally amazing and it is very hard to choose one but ya of course, 'bin tere' will keep reverberating in your mind. the title song is amazing, shreya ghoshal has given her best solo 'bahara', 'sadka' is also very nice and has the feel of 'khuda jaane', jab mila tu is a cool semi love song. imraan has acted very nice. \nhonestly, i need to watch this film 10000 times to find any mistakes, this is flawless. \nreviewing after anjaana anjaani so just loved the movie\ni rate this 10/10","label":0},{"review":"hi... i m biggest fan for shaqfat anm ali khan u r totally song r my favorite...  song mostlly one song yarrian movie  love u please create a new album i m very excited for u any new song..... love u","label":0},{"review":"i didn\"t trust in love because of hurting... but by watching this movie it again stuck into my mind and heart that no... love does exist ... real love does exist... and this movie is really really awesome... love it","label":0},{"review":"i really like it\nalso it became my favorite movie of all time... \ni am just waiting for it second part.. \nbut in second part i like to see the same characters in part one... they all are superb... \nplease makes it... \n🙏🙏🙏🙏","label":0},{"review":"this movie is the total package it has everything in it non believer of love his point of view and his journey of understanding what true love means and it gives hope to others  in a different manner and the songs are splendid don't miss it","label":0},{"review":"very underrated movie. its a beautiful love story with good romance and great songs too. i can watch this movie any no. of times","label":0},{"review":"most very good entertainment movie for a love story in the life and excellent song i hate luv storys, thank you so much - punit sir and all stars","label":0},{"review":"if you say imran khan is useless actor i recommend you to watch this movie, he so brilliant in this movie.i still like this movie s lot and enjoy it to core. one of the best imran khan movies ever.","label":0},{"review":"very very romantic movie and beautiful 😍😍😍😍 as well & it filled my heart 💖💖 & i really appreciate it 👌👌👌,we always want to see such type of movies","label":0},{"review":"what i was wondering or thinking about imran khan was totally wrong actually after watching this movie i wondered that imran khan is absolutely very good actor after this he is my first favourite actor and the songs which i love a most","label":0},{"review":"i believe in love and this movie just re-affirmed my faith! i love love so much. i hope i find love one day","label":0},{"review":"wonderful movie!!  really liked it a lot!!  😍😍wish for a 2nd part!!","label":0},{"review":"i love this film and  the story is also awesome and this is a feast for romantic movie lovers","label":0},{"review":"this was a really nice and inspiring movie. i think that this movie should get 10/10","label":0},{"review":"one of the best romantic comedy movie imran and sonam nailed it","label":0},{"review":"i love this amazing love story 💕. there is magic in tragedy","label":0},{"review":"i watched it long back, but i still remember it. real good!","label":0},{"review":"most underrated movie but whenever i get free time i watch this movie again and again.","label":0},{"review":"it is an underrated movie. i like this film","label":0},{"review":"i just love this movie .... such a cute and lovely film","label":0},{"review":"i 😍 this movie and it's song are  fantastic","label":0},{"review":"very fantastic n amazing movie heart touching 💗🖤","label":0},{"review":"speechless as this movie is so so beautiful","label":0},{"review":"this movie has parts copied from how i met your mother tv series.","label":0},{"review":"i like this movie. great acting by imran khan","label":0},{"review":"good, at last love is realised","label":0},{"review":"best movie","label":0},{"review":"amazing movie.....love you imran","label":0},{"review":"love songs best","label":0},{"review":"most beautiful story","label":0},{"review":"nice mov\n\n\nie","label":0},{"review":"loved this movie 😘","label":0},{"review":"wow super movie","label":0},{"review":"i really do hate luv storys .....fabulously paradoxical","label":0},{"review":"i like this movie very much","label":0},{"review":"school memories 🎉💕","label":0},{"review":"must watch","label":0}]
