[{"review":"first of all i don't review every movie which comes and goes. but this movie is having special place in my heart. \n\nso why to watch-\n\n1- a lovestory that is so true and pure teaches, if you really love something or someone in your life you will get it irrespective of all the hurdles.\n\n2- it's also about friends who will be with you throughout your life sometimes creating troubles and sometimes helps you without you noticing it.\n\n3-if you really wanna know \"what a girl really wants\" then this movie is a sure go.\n\n4- this movie will teach you, what not to do when in love.\n\n5- and yes watch it for the amazing performance of main leads as well as supporting cast like vrajesh hirjee for his amazing comic timing. you won't forget him easily.\n\n6- amazing songs that you will be singing in your mind for so many times that you will forget the count.\n\n bonus review-\n\ni really love the background music everytime hero meets or sees heroin. . .just amazing. .

engineering.\ni still enjoy this movie. it reminds me how i completed my engineering and handled my love life simultaneously. and yes there were fights in my clg life. i acted like a hero. movie had such impact on me. but seriously at some point of my clg life, i got treated as a college star.\nits been 6 years now that i passed out from my clg. my college is still using my pictures in the brochure and advertisement and on display boards.\nrecently went for my college alumni meet. current students recognised me as the college advertisement guy. that nostalgia was like whole rhtdm was going through my mind. met my ex there. recalled what we had. things aren't like what u wish for. i was trying to recall how she looked 6 years ago. now she's a mother. she became a woman now. spending time with her made me go through my whole college life all over again. this reunion thing is quite emotional. friends, teachers, old places, classes made me feel like maddy again. i was again a hero. i again acted like maddy without regret. this time i collected all those in my pictures‚ù§Ô∏è","label":0},{"review":"it was the day of 19 october,  a cyclone of love came in bollywood named

myself from doing it now because i really want to tell the others that whoever hasn't seen it already trust me you are really gonna miss one of the best romantic  movies made by bollywood .....above all you will love r.madhavan's acting , his expressions and his eyes ......today after all this years i rewatched and seriously i will never hesitate watching it\nagain .....and its songs are so touching and beautiful ......","label":0},{"review":"if you are confused as to whether you love some or not, just question yourself two things.\n1. whether you have the same passion, desire and will to do anything for her/him just like maddy is until the arrival of rajeev.\n2. whether you have the same resoluteness, desperation and determination maddy has to get her love back after the arrival of rajeev.\n\nthis just is one of the best films of all time whichever language and industry it might be. madhavan just killed it in this movie.","label":0},{"review":"this is one of the evergreen movies
