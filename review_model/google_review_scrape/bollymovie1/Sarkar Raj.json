[{"review":"well crafted and aptly acted by all . ishould mention here of abhishek who pulled off his part brilliantly. he shines in some of the edging scenes . amitabh sir is always a top of the line actor . i appeal to audience to see family :ties of blood where he acted as a brutal chieftain . he stands out amongst all. villains in sarkar raj are worth watching . aishwarya is a star . she should go for more of these sort of roles. rest assured. an honest approach for a vigilante genre .👍","label":0},{"review":"best of the series followed by part 1 and the worst flop part 3. \nsarkar 2 is a must watch. after this movie the storyline of sarkar 3 is a dead give away.","label":0},{"review":"such a wonderful story ... amitabh bachan is too good no words for him 👌🏻","label":0},{"review":"sarkar raj was still okay but sarkar 3 i didn't like much it was rubbish. not satisfied with sarkar 3.","label":0},{"review":"all likes of godfather & the last don written by mario puzzo","label":0},{"review":"watch godfather were sarkar copied it well","label":0},{"review":"i like 3 part of sarkar","label":0},{"review":"remove the curtains of indian politics","label":0},{"review":"one of  master piece...........","label":0}]
