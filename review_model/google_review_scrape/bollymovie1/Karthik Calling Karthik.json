[{"review":"my rating -- 5 stars!! if you want why?\nhere's the answer.\nokay, so recently done watching this movie and god i have dosen of things to say about it!\nfirst of all, surely after this movie, i can guarantee i am now farhan's biggggest fan...!! seriously he portrayed this challenging role with so much perfection that we can't remain satisfied without praising his versatility! and yeah, also, ram kapoor, deepika padukone, and other supporting caste had done their role well too!\nnext comes the story, which is yet another very strong point of this amazing psychological thriller, which will  deliver definitely a new kind of experience to the audience, and which keep them engaged throughout the whole running minutes, as it touches almost all the genres, especially that 'thrill' and 'suspense'\nwell, maybe it is because there isn't much time had gone for me watching this film, but really i for myself hadn't found anyrlthing wrong or illogical or boring in the film!\nand last but not least, i also want to praise the director and his direction as he has also done a pretty believable job, he surely knows how to maintain the suspense and the thrill at the same time!!\nso yeah, if you want a new experience, a great psychological thriller, this is a must watch. go ahead!!","label":0},{"review":"one of those rare impactful bollywood movies, karthik calling karthik is bound to leave you enamoured with the inexplicable functionalities of human mind. schizophrenia is real and deserves attention with utmost care. great work by the team to shed light on this otherwise less talked about or hardly known or even acknowledged mental disorder. hope to see more movies on such topics to help create public awareness and sensitisation.","label":0},{"review":"an incredible movie to watch.... if you are a lover of psychological thriller movies, then go for it.... you will surely enjoy it.... i think this movie is underrated, it should have a rating of at least 8/10 in imdb or even according to me....  the starcasts have given brilliant performances...  so finally i would like to conclude this by saying it is an outstanding movie by vijay lalwani.....","label":0},{"review":"i liked the movie very much, just speechless. \n\nschizophrenia or any other psychological disorders should be cured in childhood by parents. but ironically some of them don't give attention and ignore (don't believe them) about the abnormality in child, and therefore sometimes children hide their serious problems from their parents because they have experienced that parents won't believe them.\nand that's why a small problem create much serious illness and often provoke to terminate the life in youth. i have only one request to all parents that - please believe in your child, just dont ignore them.","label":0},{"review":"metal disorder sometimes not diagnosed correctly. sometimes its a a different belief system of a victim patients. he might think of possibility of world operating away from convention methods of matteristic world concern selfish motive where i is first than we. modern diagnosis and psychology needs to be revised and it must
