[{"review":"gunday is a movie which is set in between the chaos of bangladesh and west bengal- basically a story set in the era of 1980s. there are two best friends who fall in love with one pole dancer who is appointed as a medium by the cops. friendship shatters and comes passion, hunt and determination to get that one lady they are commonly interested in- an idea adapted from the traditional story of a damsel called tilottama- who was the root cause of rift between two brothers who were demons disturbing people living on the planet. the idea also seems to dwell upon some major classics india's cinema industry is proud of. \nthe only thing i like about this movie is- costumes and sets! and the music! you could always dance on 'tune maari entriyaan' or wear sexy lingerie for that night...and it's a pleasure to watch kolkata in all its retro vibes.\nas for the writing, its worst when it comes to this movie. ranveer singh has fallen victim to a false script, and arjun kapoor fails to create any sequence even when it is his game. priyanka chopra and irrfan khan perform quiet well despite the scene is not good. well, concluding by talking about the climax- i don't like and i felt hurt about the idea that the festival of joy and life turns the festival of dark and death in this movie- durga puja. \ni don't like this movie. sorry for the fans.","label":0},{"review":"this movie was really an average movie.\npositives: ranveer singh shines in his role and physical appearance, locations,songs,irfan khan also did his role well but not that perfectly as he looked unsuitable as a cop. action scenes were over the top but still good,1st half was good,powerful dialogues. good bgm by julius paickam.\nnegative: arjun kapoor and priyanka chopra overacted all along in the movie, fake bengali accent by all actors which irritated a lot,weak editing,sort of boring 2nd half due to weak screenplay.\noverall it's one time watch movie for those who have love movies directed by  ali abbas zafar.\nratings:5/10.","label":0},{"review":"actors acting were too good . one thing we had learned from this movie that we should never lose hope . ups and downs is there in each and everyones life we have to accept . even if a billionaire or millionaire also have ups and downs in their business because they always has stress about their profit and loss they are always dealing with that . we think that they are roaming in mercedes and in jaguar staying in 5 star hotels roaming in business class they are very happy but it's not like that. even we think that mr mukesh ambani  is very happy with this lifestyle staying in 27th storied house like antila and he has600 staffs  with three helipads we think that he is very happy but it's not like that he alwaysthink that my bussiness is not running in loss or my son has not done any bad thing because this kinds of thing always roaming in his mind","label":0},{"review":"gunday is set in the emergency of bangladesh and west bengal in 1980.. vikram and balla(ranveer singh and arjun kapoor) struggle their lifes through this emergency period.. they are the best friends who shares everything with each other. but the caoes begins when these best friends fall in love with an charming lady (priyanka chopra)....\nafter the entry of priyanka chopra the movie falls under same genre triangular love-story and misunderstandings gradually the movie lacks it's trp and becomes regular movie type.... so i can't tell this movie is outstanding.. just ok for time pass...","label":0},{"review":"gundaay 2014\n\nscreenplay - 73/100\ncinematography - 48/100\nscript - 50/100\nacting - 34/100\ndirection -  71/100\nvfx - n.a\nmusic/songs - 88/100\n\nimdb rating - 2.1/10\n\nmy rating - 35/100 or 3.5/10\n\nabout the script it is just a classical bollywood story with a friendship and everything in the movie is clean predictable moment.  the plot is all recurring all over the bollywood movie with the romance and betrayal with viewers already knew what's going to happen.\nali abbas direction makes the movie a little watchable while we see the pale acting from ranveer , arjun and priyanka . the movie has nothing spectacular to offer rather bengali plot.","label":0},{"review":"i loved the movie.. its the movie of friendship.. yarriyoon.. who have not best frd i think he also unlike this movie.. the movie is superb #ranveersinghandarjun doing awesone.. ranveer bst","label":0},{"review":"who the hell is this give 2.1 to this movie??
