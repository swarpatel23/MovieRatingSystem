[{"review":"i love this movie, chennai express, and i am american, but not indian.... i laughed a lot and think it was very entertaining..... i have watched it five times now and i will watch it more.... the movie is absolutely fantastic and the interaction between the two leads is amazing....  the faces that they made and the non-verbal communication between them is superb. their verbal communication is well timed and full of humor......  the fight scenes are intense, but the courage and strength of heart was almost tangible. the growth of character and the mutual support was inspiring..... also the landscapes, waterfalls, the train, the temple, the people, the costumes, the dancing, the singing, etc.... were beautiful......","label":0},{"review":"well, it's an indian movie. there's always some bluffing and songs and unique romance. it has been one of the best movies i've seen. although, the language could be english, it's still one of a kind. \nanother thing is that, it's a comedy movie somehow. the comedy ,i believe, could  be better understood for eastern and middle east countries. i know it because i watch american comedies.\nand the most important thing is it's songs. the combination of the eastern and western music makes it the best. believe me, you are gonna like it! \nin conclusion, this movie surely differ from other indian ones. so, for starters watch this movie and for those who are into indian, it is still recommended.","label":0},{"review":"well, chennai express may have crossed the rs. 200 crore mark  but to make a movie that is nothing but sheer nonsense shows that the actor and the director are in no mood to make a movie that is superb in content and worth a watch more than once. chennai express is nothing but a safe bet that has clicked mostly because of the hype and the only movie to be screened during the holiday season. to end with, the director's attitude is to make movies for the masses, well i am one among the masses and you have failed miserably. also, this thing wont work for long, because some day content will actually be the king","label":0},{"review":"well i liked it.  overall it's a rom-com movie. somehow it's shows indian society, views, way of thinking, family values. and most of how 2 people from different cultures, different languages unites by love. and as a indian i know how north and south not get along because of language thing. somehow it shows this situation in a dramatic way. at last i love it.","label":0},{"review":"well, it's an indian movie. there's always some bluffing and songs and
