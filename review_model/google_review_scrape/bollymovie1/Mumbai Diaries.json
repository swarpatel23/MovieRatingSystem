[{"review":"dhobi ghat (mumbai diaries) \ni can watch it 10k times, so my mindwish  to watch it atleast before going to bed daily. masterpiece  excellent mindblowing heartfelt surprisable movie .really this film is my type , very different movie, incomparable , top class .incredible achievements. i think dg can be understood minutely  thoroughly by a creative mind, mainly introvert people only.much more perception  or sense of humour  / deep concentration  needs to clear suggest  vividly. usually whenever it rains,  my mind 'd lean to watch just dg. i can write a book based on plot summary of dhobi ghat  and its aspect to our entire  human society , it is the  first picture,  which is watched  continuously thrice in a day  by my eyes.valuable life philosophy lies within  1:40 duration  wrapped movie. acting in this movie is very natural instinctive. so,  easily could attract an emotional audiences. \n   monica kriti prateik kiranmaam aamirsir -all did magnificently  outstanding performance. fitest and eligible actors for their choosed characters. shay role well played by monica,  who has very broad outlook. monica's appearance, eye contact  r mind blowing. kriti's voice is too sweet, lovable, cute as well as her similarities  innocent  look.  munna-childish, sensitive, dreamy. well performed by prateik. finally  ak is well suit  for arun role,perfect matchable. he acted  with full p.c of dedication passion minutely observations. i saw myself in arun\n   anyway, 4 people of different fields intersect each other in a city  named mumbai.shay well connected  with 2, arun with 3, yasmin with 1 (indirect) ,munna with 2.these  4 persons climax happened with  tragedy- melancholy  -nothing. so life is just abt  dream or veil, nothing guarantees  reality in this wicked world, still humans r running for finding fake  honey. none knows the truth.life is thus since oldest past-present- future.lt denotes our ignorance. so we have to live within the society just in lightly with knowing  the real inner truth  - detaching worldly  materialistic affairs;  only those people can be successful to  acquire peace something in the heavenly earth,  no doubt.in this picture,  arun only  wants to find out \"what's called real life \" and for this  always he hides  to both self as well as to others. he wants to manage his art work  in a narrow studio apartment  ; that's why he'd  be able to vision  the entire field  of imagination world  and can discover himself better way with  as  more n more  introvert  for his  living creative touch. this story  is purely based on  all of us,  earth people,day to day life.\n     arun  connected emotionally  only with yashmin  and that's  vast journey for  him for reaching  at aim of creative- knowing the humanity better.he had natural affection towards yasmin , not love atall..ultimately yasmin's effect  reflected on him as well with   munna's effect on shay. although once arun's physical touch  to shay  but that's not fixed,but accidentally. in opposite, shai  had little dissapointment  in the fact of affairs.  she had love towards  dual and her inner mind  searched a company  but  n't in a right way  exactly. finally she is crying  having with emotions  abt arun-munna-new address  -melancholy atmosphere- local culture-  values of life. arun was single  (separated)   alws engrossed  himself with  devotion,  thought abt life as a painter cum philosopher  and it was the  best job idea  of him forever.shai returned  with her research  abt culture, deep sensitivity  feelings  abt frs  and  things as a learner .yasmine was cute,  simple, sensitive and  natural instinctive, less modern  and that's the reason  behind  unhappy married life  and finally tragic self made death. munna role denotes  our proverty,  struggle, dreams.how the behaves is a fact  towards  innocent lower level  people of  rich  powerful  hands. in last munna got very upset  after death of intimate brother  and realized the differences  discrimination between poor and rich,  kind and cruel,   violence  and humanity,  &life .he lost  love.life shape changed  ful","label":0},{"review":"every day i go

debut of kiran rao, brilliantly written plots and its unique way of unfolding tiny details.\nthe best part of all is its subtle artistic narration of mumbai's lifestyle from different perspective of
