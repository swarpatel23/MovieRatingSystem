[{"review":"i love this movie, the vibe it delivers from start to end is just breathtaking. the mesmerizing scenes from the state of jammu and kashmir are beautiful to watch on the big screen.\n\nthe patriotic feeling that it develops in each of the viewer is brilliant. the whole team behind the camera has done a commendable job but this does not mean the one in front were any less, hrithik roshan and p. zinta delivered a convincing performance.\n\nthis movie was a great watch and even after years it still is even today.","label":0},{"review":"actors acting were too good . i have seen this movie 234 times . songs were too good. social message they given in this movie you should good work for your own country and you youngsters have fixed a goal about your career . that what you want do in your life what you want become. doctor engineer lawyer pilot scientists chef etc . your parents will pay money for your education and they will supply cash to you that is absuutely fine . but in their absence you have to manage your own daily bread for yourself it's reality. when boman irani was scolding hrithik roshan that you have taken my permission for applying in ima indian military academywhen boman irani was telling to hrithik roshan that ian there for earning money . but it's not correct way to treat your children lke that .","label":0},{"review":"watched this movie so many

not at par with uri, but surely it none the less. lakshya takes you to the world of indian army. it is a journey of a aimless man to a hero of army. mr. roshan as played his role magnificently and its more of a war film then romantic. also its not like every thing in war is focused on karan (roshan) the team work and different characters are given importance . today's young generation  should surely watch this film to find their lakshya of life. i give this film 4/5 . jai hind, jai bharat","label":0},{"review":"hrithik roshan has been always doing unique roles to prove his versatility. he
