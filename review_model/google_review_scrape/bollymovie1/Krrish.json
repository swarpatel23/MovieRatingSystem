[{"review":"krrish has been a sweet part of my childhood and it was this movie that introduced him to me and so many other young viewers. as a child i mostly saw the film from the portion the sequences leading  the protagonist to wear the mask and had not seen much of what unfolded in the first half. \n\nbut as of today, i have to admit that the first half is almost terrible. except the first 15-16 minutes and the entire pre-interval sequence involving an emotional conversation, the remaining first half is filled with not so impressive songs and the romantic subplot is unnecessarily stretched. to be honest, if you just watch the first 15-16 minutes and jump straight to the above said pre-interval sequence, you're not missing anything. \n\nbut from the interval sequence to the end, the film's totally different. it's only then that it starts to get entertaining and gripping, although one more song spoils it slightly. \n\nhowever, if these flaws are kept aside, krrish is a good, entertaining superhero movie that features breathtaking action sequences and an emotionally resonant performance from hrithik roshan and rekha. the director has not just created a visual spectacle but also added plenty of emotional moments that make any superhero movie memorable. the cgi too is quite good for a movie that came long ago. \n\nit's not the best superhero film ever made, obviously. but it does have some really great things many contemporary films don't have. krrish is a great effort and even though it succeeds not completely, it still has so many positives that those flaws can be ignored after a point of time.\n\n7/10.","label":0},{"review":"positives: the vfx and the cinematography were top notch,action sequences were designed well,hritik roshan did his role well and same applies on naseeruddin,direction was good. good locations. comedy scenes.\nnegatives:too many songs just seemed irritating to me, editing was not done well and that is why the movie felt long to me.\nbut still overall a good to watch and such movies with great concept should be made in india.\nratings:6.5/10","label":0},{"review":"i think it's a great movie. at a time when almost all the film makers were going on the same track, mr. roshan chose to do something different. i agree that hollywood was making superhero films way before than krrish but to say that it is copied is wrong.\ni still remember when this movie was released and it became the first ever indian movie to touch the 100 crore mark globally. i enjoy watching this every time and i hope you all do the same. :)","label":0},{"review":"seen the film once again recently and made me realize how good this film was. if this was a hollywood film, would have been a huge success,  but unfortunately it's gonna be seen as stupid just because it's a bollywood film. great story, great acting, really good vfx considering it came out in 2006, and mostly - the music. the background music in this movie is goosebumps worthy. 8/10","label":0},{"review":"the best movie series in sci-fi bollywood movies. krishh has made it with great acting of hrithik roshan, the charming hero with superpowers. this movie has inspired various movies and can be watched by anyone ...100%good. good drama,story, music ,acting plot, comedy and great action thrill.","label":0},{"review":"what ever was the theam or whatever was the story, really does not matter in this techie erra  !!!\nthe theme practically goes with this techie era !!
