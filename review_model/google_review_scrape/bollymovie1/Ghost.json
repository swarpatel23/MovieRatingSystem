[{"review":"ghost- what a movie, from direction to story line, from acting to expression game and increasing curiosity with each passing scene was excellent. it has element of engaging audience till end. no melodramatic scary affects, no unrealistic ghost vfx affects, sutble portrayal of what fear of spiritual entities aound us, is. \noverall best movie of the day on which am happy to spend money on. i will recommend audience to go watch this movie, its worth watching. if audience rating matters then i will love to give 3.5 for sanaya irani's acting, vikram's direction, cinematography, perfect blend of intense, romance, horror, thriller element in story plot and soulful bg scores.","label":0},{"review":"blockbuster. amazing movie.  \n\nwords are missing to describe this masterpiece. mesmerizing performances and a good horror scenes that really scares you, this is by far one of the best in indian cinema and will set higher standards. coupled with an intelligent script, great background score and beautiful locations, this movie is a delight to watch. the storyline is not boring even for a second and will keep you on the edge of your seats. sanaya owns the movie but the others performed so well. \nthe performance of sanaya irani is sublime, her body expression, her look in each scene, her pain and of course her facial expressions.... the emotional scenes she expressed so well.... that you can feel her feelings. and the music of the movie are amazing. no wonder they became hit immediately. very very good!!!! brilliant ghostüëèüëèüëè everyone should watch this masterpiece!","label":0},{"review":"ghost review :\n\nafter ramsays in the 80s, it is vikram bhatt who has been the torchbearer of horror genre in bollywood. delivering campy (at times cheesy) products like 'raaz' (2002), '1920' (2008) and 'haunted' (2011), vikram has tasted fair amount of success mixing liberal doses of sex with horror. his latest film 'ghost' is similar to 'raaz' and '1920' in terms of theme but falls a tad short in the scare quotient. moreover, even the sex scenes are quite thanda here..\n\na morphine addicted lawyer (sanaya irani) takes up the case of a politician (shivam bhaargava) accused of murdering his wife. \"i didn't do it, a ghost did\", is his defence. before we can say boo...the lawyer starts experiencing the paranormal. she also falls hopelessly in love with her client. it's all too familiar and far too predictable. \n\non the films positive, the london setting lends the film a glossy look. a couple of songs are pleasing to the ears and well shot. \n\nleaping from tv to the silver screen, sanaya irani is impressive as the lawyer turned lover who gets entangled in this bhootiya case. she not only looks hot and sexy in the bold scenes but is equally convincing in the courtroom. the lady can look forward to more mature roles in bollywood! \n\non the other hand, shivam bhargaava is absolutely dull and wooden even in an author backed role. he appears dazed and lost in most of the scenes. emraan hashmi, you are missed!!\n\nfinally, ghost, justifying its title, is just a ghost of vikram bhatt's past successes offering nothing new. boo hoo! \n\nregards\nsumeet nadkarni","label":0},{"review":"sanaya acting wow she is amazing she bs her movie are so underrated. so talented yaar . waiting for to see more of her in bollywood other than all the actors with no talent only there because of their parents. god bless sanaya wish her more happiness and success . the movie has a lovely story and the actors chemistery really good","label":0},{"review":"the wealthy hero is accused of murdering his wife. he claims hes innocent n the murder was committed, in his absence, by a ghost. why would anyone believe him in todays times? who is this ghost? what is its intention? why do extra marital affairs always have sad endings? #ghostthefilm is shot on excellent locations. but when will vikram bhatt understand that the audience cant be spooked by hideous faces, flickering lights n creaking doors? sanaya irani is good n deserves to be seen in better films. rating 1.5/5.","label":0},{"review":"i generally hate horror films, it makes me frightening!\nbut only for sanaya i watch #ghost and it's worth watching!\n o god !
