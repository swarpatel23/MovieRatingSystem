[{"review":"plot spoilers\n\ndon't expect great sophistication; this is a very simple-minded action movie. it isn't \"rollercoaster\" and it isn't \"juggernaut\" (though the bomber in \"speed\" is like the one in \"juggernaut\" in having changed sides). being much newer, \"speed\" obviously has better special effects and, as one would expect, much better acting, not just in the lead roles. particularly look out for glenn plummer, who always seems to have small parts, but who plays them so well that i would really like to see what he would be like in a lead role.\n\ndennis hopper, the perennial mad villain, delivered another masterful performance as the bomb squad cop turned bomber. an obvious psychopath, he sits in front of multiple tv screens and won't miss a ball game even while he uses his other screens to keep tabs on a bus full of hostages and his chief antagonist, played by keanu reeves.\n\nthe title scene, in an elevator shaft, uses camera angles highly reminiscent of hitchcock's \"north by northwest\". you may recall that hitchcock once claimed that he had made a mistake in a film by allowing a bomb to go off. he more or less lamented the minimal effect it had for all the effort and expense that had gone into it. show the bomb to the audience but not to the characters! get minutes of suspense out of it, without setting it off, instead of one mighty bang that's over in seconds.\n\nbut he had not made a mistake by letting the bomb go off. he made a mistake by claiming to have made a mistake! one explosion, expensive perhaps, made him a director whose bomb might actually go off. then he disowned this plot device, losing the advantage he had bought dearly. watch any later film by such a director and you will know that the bomb will not go off. the suspense is ruined!\n\nin \"speed\", the mad bomber delivers a rant about his adversaries trying to stop the bomb from becoming. he complains that it it doesn't go off it just becomes a cheap gold watch (like the one he got on being sent off into retirement after losing two fingers). in the real world, the man would be a dangerous psychopath, in film he is a valid critic of hitchcock, though one shouldn't be too liberal with explosions. the present film gives us bombs that go off and bombs that don't, which is as it should be, and as it unfortunately is in real life. the film reserves its lack of realism for all the things that most of the good characters in it survive, each of which requires a bus to be controlled by miracles instead of being the work of merely human engineers.\n\nnear the end, the bomber loses his head and his chief antagonist boasts of being taller than he. gene hackman had a very similar line in \"narrow margin\", four years earlier, after a hitwoman loses her head in identical circumstances.\n\noh, the runaway subway train could obviously be stopped by just turning off the power supply. the money drop, said to be on the northeast corner of a junction is clearly on the southwest corner, as can be seen from the shadows of the lamp posts. nobody would operate an airport while there is a bus with a bomb circling the runways and, surely, when a large cargo plane is utterly destroyed, in hindsight it would have been cheaper to pay the ransom quickly and worry about catching the bomber later.\n\nin total, this is a formulaic hostage drama with much more action and bigger special effects, a good film to watch when you want to relax your brain, but not a top thriller otherwise.","label":0},{"review":"you might think this film is about hollywood's latest drug obsession, though, peripherally, it's more similar to an extended episode of 'starsky and hutch' or 's.w.a.t.' - except, if you can believe it, there was more drama and plot development in those old tv shows. talk about action! there's tons of it in 'speed': explosions, fist fights, gun fire, people even losing a head, literally. the movie is about an ex bomb squad cop whose failed bomb extortion plot leads him to devise another one, though this time more personally, by involving the cop who foiled his last attempt. the villain's new plan is to put a bomb on a city bus that must travel in excess of 50 mph or else the bomb will explode, thus the title. the cops trying to rescue the bus are, at turns, excessively competent and incompetent. as stated earlier there is little plot in the film nor much drama - actually, none; nada. if you've seen a lot of these types of films, this one won't be very special at all.","label":0},{"review":"i remember this movie when it came out. it was hyped by my friends but so worth it to watch. keanu and sandra make really good actors to watch . this film is fun from start to finish. you wont be disappointed at all. oh i gotta mention dennis hopper (late) who played the bad guy. he was entertaining as well! rip to him.","label":0},{"review":"this film was good sandra bullock and keanu reeves. had great timing in\nthis film. there is only so much that you can do with. films about crazy \npeople that want to blow things up. to make a point but other than that.\ni did like this film. the late dennis hopper was great in this film. i really thought that he was insane. this film made me think about taking a bus.\ni wish that they would do a nother film together. i'm hoping that she doesn't really retire from films. because she is very good in dramas. there are \nonly a few comedies that she did. that i liked like the proposal, while you\nwere sleeping. two weeks notice. but her dramas were really good.\nlike the net. murder by numbers. premonition.","label":0},{"review":"i've seen this about 10 times but if it's on, i must watch it again and again. the story is pathbreaking and has been copied in hindi movies also. jack as the young hero policeman is so sincere and likeable never having encountered such a problem bit trying his best. #keanureeves as jack is someone every girl in danger wants to meet and be rescued by. brilliant!!!","label":0},{"review":"this is one of the best movies with action to date, i think. high recommend to anyone who is a fan of action thrillers and fast vehicles. wish they would make a movie similar to this, but with fast cars, but nothing like the fast and furious franchise.\n\nthis movie does not make the heroine a victim, and instead portrays her as a strong, capable female who is able to man a bus.","label":0},{"review":"i don’t like cursing so my ears were kinda bleeding afterward, but it was so good. that’s the best kind of story, in my view. \nokay so here’s the situation. what could possibly go wrong. i probably won’t watch it again without vidangel or something, but i’m glad i watched it. jack and annie made a really, really great pair. \n\n\n\nalso, i would not have survived this movie.","label":0},{"review":"speed's name says it all. this high action thriller shows stakes that have never been this high. keanu reeves plays a cop on the hunt for a terrorist played by dennis hopper. with multiple bumps along the road, there'sno telling if the bus will ever make it to the next station. speed is everything an action movie should be.","label":0},{"review":"one of the best hollywood movies. evergreen after few years u would like to see again. what an incredible performance of the actors. excellent!
