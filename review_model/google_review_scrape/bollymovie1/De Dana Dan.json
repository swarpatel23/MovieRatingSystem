[{"review":"a typical ''leave your brain behind'' comedy flick. the movie is excellent in terms of the performances weather by actors or crew or the music. it has become quite a good combination. the move is full time pass and i had a great time watching.\nthe story is on a similar lines as herapheri. akshay kumar and sunil shetty are friends and want to get rich as soon as possible otherwise their girlfriends would be forcibly married by their family to someone else. their scheme of getting rich lands them in pan pacific hotel where paresh rawal is trying to get his son chunkey pandey married with sameera reddy. now starts the confusion of mistaken identity, lies and what not. all the confusion reaches its summit and explodes in the end.\nthings i like in this movie ~ some good funkiest dialogues, some funny punchlines, some funny scenes that holds your attention, whole katrina kaif and some good songs...","label":0},{"review":"'ddd' did avg.business on box office but the  film was capable to do very good business on b.o. fantastic comedy storyline as compared to previous film of priyadarshan. hats off to script, story, screenplay writer. a very big multistarrer film in modern era. this type of film were made by manmohan desai. priyadarshan handled very carefully every character. the main usp of the film is supporting actors who have given full justice to their role.70% co-actor has taken the responsibility on their shoulder. not easy work to direct so many actors  hard work can be seen. every character whether it is small/big has important role. after hrishikesh mukherjee, priyadarshan is the only director who can give good healthy comedy film. 'ddd' can be watch 1000 times as compared to todays foolish films.\nmantra for  comedy films - no space for emotions in comedy.","label":0},{"review":"i'm sure it took a lot of talent and skill to assemble the story line and ensemble cast to develop the film. \n\ni thoroughly enjoyed the first 45 minutes of the film when everyone is introduced and the jokes made me laugh out loud, especially from akshay kumar, johnny lever,  and shakti kapoor.\n\nthe remaining 2 hours were the drag where i lost pretty much the whole plot. jokes were not present at all,  just confusions. \n\nthe back ground music is exactly the same for 2 hours of the film and i got sick of it.\n\nthere are 5 story lines and only one is solved.  and that too of a fraud. \n\nakshay kumar spent 70 percent of the film locked in for closet. and all girls apparently just love money.  the love stories would have ended if the money did not come in the hand of the men.","label":0},{"review":"this movie is good and funny and can keep you entertained. it had good performances and some scenes can keep you laughing on and on. it's not the easiest to understand though, i had to replay parts of the movie over and over to fully understand it. so if you like simple to-the-point movies, de dana dan is not for you. however if you like movies that have complex plots and different storylines, i say go for it and watch this movie, definitely recommend it.","label":0},{"review":"hilarious.  i loved it and can watch it over and over again.  i loved akshay, he has great comic timing.  it was a total laugh riot.  not boring for a minute.  fast paced and it was very good movie on comedy of errors.  even the music was catchy and enjoyable.  rishte naate song is the one i loved.  you can watch this movie over and over.","label":0},{"review":"de dana dan was second utter rubbish movie. i didn't understand a single story. its not a comedy movie it's jokery film. i don't no why indian audience support this kinds of jokery movies which dosnt make any sense at all. just for earning 2 to 3 corer ruppess they select this kinds of movies. and still this kind of movies become highest grossing and earning a lot in box office . its a totally rubbish movie.","label":0},{"review":"great movie..dont know how it was unrated!really funny and relaxing movie. great actors and performance of each individual is awesome. well done. you must have a good focus on the movie, and you will really enjoy. too good","label":0},{"review":"saw it in 2019 and if they could have kept it more tight it would have been a better movie.\n\nthey played with confusion and comedy and i loved the comedy part. \n\nbrains have to be left aside. \n\ncg effects -
