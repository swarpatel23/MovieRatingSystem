[{"review":"i can never forget the climax, the very final scene from the movie, where brigadier rudra pratap singh, in the heat of the moment, confessess his part in the mishaps and how he blames of the horrible horrible things that one person did to his family to the whole community. but what struck me the most was when he got up and started behaving as if he said nothing, as if he did nothing wrong, as if didn't just confessed his wrong, rather told a story of his bravery and valour. it was unsettling and disturbing and yet i didn't feel anger, rather i felt sorry for the man, who once had a good enough heart to keep a 10year old orphan muslim guy in his home, was now untouched by the thought of killing a six year old muslim girl. the man who himself lost a daughter so brutally, got so cold that such a thought even didn't send chills down his spine. everyone grows up and gets mature and wise but the day someone looses the last bit of innocence, nothing can be worse than that.","label":0},{"review":"must say it's a one sided movie, wrong depiction of our army. \na fact - one section of people will surely love it, from the reviews you can figure out which one. the other section will be divided depending on the 'fake secularism/liberalism' he/she posseses.\nsuch a shame that they had to use our army for their agenda.\ncan they make same movie by interchanging kk's character with dobriyal's? \nno, it wouldn't suit the agenda! \n\nthe makers have intentionally ignored the real situation of the 'area', real reason of trouble in that 'area' instead shown some imaginary cooked story.","label":0},{"review":"the only good thing about the movie was kay kay menon. intense actingðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ.\n\nno offence but it was a one sided movie with the whole motive to prove javed khan innocent(lazy writing). poor storyline and also felt it was kind of trying to defame indian army with communalism-could have handled this much better!!!\n\noverall-6/10.\nsongs-lame\nkashmir visuals- could have shown more but still breathtaking.\nstory line- average.","label":0},{"review":"a nice movie with good story! must watch for every1! & please please don't miss the messages which are given just after climax scene! those messages are given with reference and resources.\ni was just reading reviews & there are so many peoples who are saying this movie is one sided. please people use your brain! how can this movie be one sided? jameel and javed both are muslims.   one is doomed & another is india's pride. siddhant & rudra pratap both are hindus & army officers but one is very good man and another one is criminal. simple! \njaihind ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³","label":0},{"review":"this movie is complete nonsense made with the intention of showing indian army officers in poor light. our soldiers never kill innocent people. it is complete wrong depiction of indian army. the personal feelings of an indian army officer never interferes with his duty. this movie looks like a conspiracy by muslim extremists and kashmiri separatists who want to to falsely claim human rights violation in the valley. they are the same people who falsely try to project hardcore terrorists pelting stones at indian army vehicles as misguided youth.","label":0},{"review":"the way in which indian army was depicted here, was a total insult to all of the people serving the nation. not taking away from the fact that there may be chances of such officers serving in the army and we are not totally aware of the situation they go through on indian border, but just ridiculing the pride of them by showing them as mass murderers of people belonging to muslim community, is totally wrong. loved kay kay menon and rahul bose in this.","label":0},{"review":"apart from kk menon, the movie don't has much to offer by it's supporting caste. deepak dobriyal is good in the limited and constrained role. javed jafrie could have been replaced by a mature looking actor. rahul bose is not up to the expectations. the journalist is extremely annoying and bubbly type for such an area.\n2.5*/5","label":0},{"review":"movie are realistic some time we can't judge officers likes rathor . indian education have to be sure learn our officers respect human being .if a group of people army tent in your town & different type of thinking person present in this group or they do something wrong we can't forget these moments & anger will come in local people .i think same are happen in kashmir.","label":0},{"review":"obviously deepak dobriyal did his job and that was brilliant. but i like this movie because of k.k. menon's act, specially the climax court room scene.  k.k. menon and deepak dobriyal are superb, but rest of the main characters r not so charming.","label":0},{"review":"superb.  k k menon is incomparable. his skills as an actor are supreme    and bose vid minisha are also superb.  dobriyal is so talented.   fantastic storyline","label":0},{"review":"such wacky picture it was.. i mean you guys do a full copy of a few good old men and them show us a poor class acting i'm really hurt dude.. the best part is

then i must say u plzz think then say...sometimes we need not have to apply democracy everywhr becoz when democratic protocols were written at that time there were no any child who has ak-47 in their hand...but now things are changing society is developing in diffetent way....just think when that child with ak-47 (mooted by terrorists) is infront you ...will u just  think this is a child or will u defence or will u think abput ur democracy....that time people r different but now r different so we hav to just adapt...","label":0},{"review":"totally one sided. horribly biased and attempt to defame army.\n\nquestion to ask is why is that always a muslim is depicted as the most pious and honest person? is bollywood trying to send a message or attempting for subtle
