[{"review":"akshay kumar is in jubilious role after getting command on comedy roles.a dash of human emotion,conviction ,love and jealousy.katrina is an epitome for statue,block or earthen pitcher.but the role suits her best as far as her comic skills goes.kya aap sab me ghee lagati hai..rishi kapoor plays typical punjabi nri father and good at it.he strikes well through comic and emotional scenes.clive stranden,nina wadia are honest british actors they play their part unforgettably.himesh reshammiyas career best music and songs written by javed akhtar solid wordings..upen patel ,javed sheikh do their best as supporting roles.","label":0},{"review":"my most fav movie and love it to the core...\nfrom this movie i became katrinas😘😍😚😙😗deepest fan.....\nlove my kat \nepitome of natural
