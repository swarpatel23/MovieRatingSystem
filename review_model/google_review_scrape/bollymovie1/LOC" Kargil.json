dutta. it's a real-life , documentary account of the 1999 kargil war fought between india and pakistan. this movie loc is not just an educative, informative and entertaining movie but it's also an experience of going back in time and relieving the iconic moments of the 1999 kargil war in the midst of the indian army soldiers. this movie was shot on the very same 20,000 feet high kargil peaks
