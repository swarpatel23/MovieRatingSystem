[{"review":"there's a saying that \"soldiers never die\"\nits very true because they leave a legacy behind them\n.\n.\nthis is not just a movie but a real inspiration that still rules a million of hearts in india as well as the whole world\n.\n.\nits a long movie so many may get bored by the running time but believe me when you see it you will wish to see it again again and those scenes and dialouges will keep coming in your mind even after several days and you will feel so proud of our soldiers that you may even cry and salute them secretly\n.\n.\na big salute to all those \"real\" heroes still standing on the borders protecting us and proud of their families too🇮🇳","label":0},{"review":"this is not just a movie, but the lives of those who sacrificed themselves wd a big smile

real-life , documentary account of the 1999 kargil war fought between india and pakistan. this movie loc is not just an educative, informative and entertaining movie but it's also an experience of going back in time and relieving the iconic moments of the 1999 kargil war in the midst of the indian army soldiers. this movie was shot on the very same 20,000 feet high kargil peaks where the armies of india and pakistan fought at the world's highest battlefields- kargil, ladakh and siachen glacier.","label":0},{"review":"jp dutta loc kargil gave goosebumps to me. sad seeing deaths of our
