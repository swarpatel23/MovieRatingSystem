dil hai mushkil that are very close to my heart and i am ensuring that i can't bored and you also can't bored to this one.\nnow, the cast is fabulous saif shows that what he is actually are in this movie and deepika is all time great actress of all time. \nand rest of the actors worked great as they do their roles.\nnow, this movie has 10 years old but it give the fell and essence of true love of all time and generations.\nimtiaz sir kii baat hi alag hai \nhe gave a real and genuine message of aal his movies like \nlove aaj kal - true love \nrockstar - live for your dream and your love \ntamasha - live for your passion \njab we met - live every moment of life very haapily and joyful and live for your love .\nand many more ...........\nwhen this movie is released i was in the 3rd class.......\nso now looking forward to this movie sequel love aaj kal 2 in which imtiaz sir cast kartik and sara both are so cute and talented and best choice for this movie sequel.. now this movie is filming and shooting in process.......\nand i think releases in next year on valentine's day (14/02/2020) and i gonna watch this movie surely........","label":0},{"review":"imtiaz ali's vision might be tough for few to understand and understandably they wont like or get it.\n\nbut those who gets the depth of each sequence what he is trying to portray on screen will always will return happily after watching movie.\n\ncoming to this movie, from my point of view it is one of imtiaz's best work .\n\nsaif is outstanding and his best work after omkara without any doubt. deepika was also great. music was faboulous.\n\nbut the real star is script and imtiaz. his way of depicting human emotion in this movie is amazing (for instance harleen drinking black tea at midnight interval shot and many more).\n\nif you feel emotion & love deeply  , you will not be disappointed !!!\n\n10 years down the line , still watch it time to time to reignite the understanding of real love and reminiscing my college days when watched it for 1st time and being in love ..","label":0},{"review":"i considered \"love aajkal\" as my life's favorite movie for whole life. i have original dvd and used to watch on 31st july every year. storyline is so much near to my heart. i used to spread info/trivia on social media about this movie like \n\n‚Äújia bandwala‚Äù is common in chor bazari (saif-deepika) and veer singh (saif ali khan) arrives with herleen kaur in last lap.\n\nbackground voice & scene  of veer singh (rishi kapoor) while jai discusses breakup-plot with meera.","label":0},{"review":"there's something about imtiaz ali movie- the characters are explorers & they can't do mundane repetitive tasks. love aaj kal portrays romance in two different time
