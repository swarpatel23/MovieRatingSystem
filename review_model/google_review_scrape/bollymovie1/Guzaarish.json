[{"review":"this is the most emotional movie i have ever watched in my entire life. hrithik as always has nailed his role to perfectionist, aishwarya rai is just like salt in a dish which isn't noticed much but without which the dish would have been incomplete, in the same way she has spiced her role in this masterpiece. sanjay leela bhansali one epic director has given the best vision to the movie. wat else can i say, i have cried the most for this movie. the movie was just 2 hrs long but made me weep forever thinking about it.\n \nthis movie isn't for all types of audiences especially not for the ones those who don't have patience. \n\ni just cannot understand why was this movie an utter flop? hrithik doesnt deserve this kinda audience we have depreciated such an overwhelming performance by one of the greatest actors of all time\n\ni was always the biggest fan of hrithik but after watching this movie he made me worship  him\nwhenever he laughed in this movie, i wept, i wept, i wept and i just wept... \nthis is a must watch movie for all the movie lovers","label":0},{"review":"stunningly, painfully beautiful, and a towering masterpiece of the hindhustani film industry; i have never cried in the first minute of a film before. ‚Äúsmile‚Äù was michael jackson‚Äôs favorite song, & sung by his brother jermaine at the memorial service. does anyone know to what degree this film was dedicated to mj? hrithik is probably the greatest living male dancer, & an amazing human being: shame on america for not awarding multiple oscars to this film. i‚Äôm an american poet & speed skater (but live in france) ‚Äì i often think that one needs to be both an athlete and artist ‚Äì a poet-warrior ‚Äì to understand michael ‚Äì or hrithik ‚Äì and how difficult our real world lives can be.","label":0},{"review":"movie is amazing with a great question.\nwhen we have a right to live with dignity then we must have the right to die with dignity.\n\nbut also here ethan lost his hope here which delivers very bad example. we don't get everything but ending life is not the solution. i expected that after marrying he would skip the idea of death. \nsnake does not have legs but they are great predators. animals have lesser iq than human do they kill themselves.\n\ni have my opinion but still this may vary from person to person.\n\nmovie is truly a master piece, well directed with great actors.\n\njust want to add, see this movie alone and with a good mood, because other people perspective or bad mood may affect your taste of the movie.","label":0},{"review":"i just avoided the movie from 8 years just because everyone said its no good, nothing to watch, boring etc etc. \nlet me tell you that this movie is not for every one. specially for the ones who use mobile while watching movie.\n\nthis is the movie i cried the most watching it in my entire life. \nnever been moved this much. hrithik roshan is a class actor and knows his craft. ash, first time i liked her performance(yes i did not like her even in devdas)\nbrilliant story telling and reality. after watching the movie i feel how privileged i am to walk, pick things.\nnever been so thankful to god. this movie has a lot to offer, if you are ready to accept and understand what its meant for. \nits not a weekend movie. its a movie where you learn about life. specially about yourself. \n\nps. sorry for this over emotional review but its the fact, i am totally moved!!!!!","label":0},{"review":"wow.. i mean imagine how a movie effects the mind of a person...so what does this movie inspire the disabled people to do?.. you can guess yourself...let me give you a true example- so it happened 2 years back when my uncle being quadriplegic choose to end his life after watching this movie as even he thought that there was no other way to live then accept your faith of being disabled..\n\ni don't understand why a person cannot survive if he or she is disabled..i mean in life you need only one good reason to live  no matter what circumstances we face!\nwhy to give up?\nstephen hawking never gave up ... because he knew the true sense of living..\nwhy promote movies like this to make someone end their lives.... thanks for inspiring my uncle to give up ..i loved him..","label":0},{"review":"it's not easy commenting on this movie coz how does one comment on a masterpiece.  the fear is that your words will be almost always undeserving. \n\nthis is sanjay leela's best ever and i really do not expect him to better this coz that good is this one.  the amazing direction with the surprise which hrithik delivers makes it an amazing watch.  aishwarya lights up the screen. the rest of the cast along with some awesome visuals and editing makes this a must watch!
