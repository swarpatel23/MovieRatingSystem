[{"review":"1st of all don't believe any negative reviews pls give ur own time and watch this #dev i assure you surely don't regret for that. it's a different type of love-adventure genre movie and that's very new for our tamil audience this type of movies usually done in malayalam nd hindi but the man #rajathravishankar nd #karthi maked it for our audiences and specially the visuals is awesome every shots was nice but some vfx was bad but even though you can love that. lead pair karthi-rakulpreet is treat to watch and they just pulled off their characters sprbly. harris jayaraj's songs was good especially haricharan's anange is‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëå bgm's sometimes felt bad maybe all people say that last 20 mins is lag nd the breakup scens is very minor problem but i can say that smallest conflict can make a relationship go off that is the idea they want to tell\n\ni completely loved it\n\nsome otherz may have feel lags of 2nd half last 20 mins but u all will surely watch this movie for its outstanding visuals nd the leadpair‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nshare ur thoughts nd hit like if you like my thoughts üëçüëç","label":0},{"review":"nice actors nice feel nice chemistry what's

(rakul preet singh) and for some reason he falls for her seeing her profile. \n\nhowever meghana ceo of dictate inc thinks differently and both views life differently. to findout where the romantic journey between dev and meghana whose thought process diverge, leads to ,enjoy dev on silver screen. \n\nperformances\n\nkarthi is ok with his looks and worked hard to elevate the scenes with his performance. rakul preet singh is ok with her looks and performance. others like ramyakrishna and prakash raj didnot get much chance to perform. vamsi \nkrishna,renuka,rj vigneshkanth,amrutha srinivasan,karthik passed through the motions. \n\nanalysis\n\nrajath ravishankar on debut came with an interesting plot to highlight the emotions when two persons with divergent views fall in love. though the line looked interesting with good climax, he failed to develop into a good story with an interesting screenplay and direction. \n\nso except for few interesting dialogues, emotional  and sentimental scenes between karthi and rakul, the story never takes off. with no story, scenes come and go dragging the entire narration in a never ending manner. rajath ravishankar failed to come with a solid story, screenplay and failed with his narration and direction thus losing a golden opportunity. \n\nin his tryst to highlight the emotions between two lovers, he failed completely with the story and screenplay. he tested the patience of the movie lovers right from the start till the finish. \n\ntechnical\n\nharris jayaraj's songs are well shot. they are attractive and foottapping. however some songs placement tested the patience of the viewers. his background score is good and elevated the scenes. cinematography of velraj captured the scenic locations in overseas in a beautiful manner. editing of anthony l ruben could have been far better as there are many drags which tested the patience of the movie lovers. director rajath ravishankar should have worked on the story, screenplay and included few twists and turns to make better impact. production values are good. \n\nplus\nkarthi\nrakul preet singh\ncinematography\nmusic, bgm

emphasis on the present generation relationship. in this movie the director has focused on the woman where she shouldn't be treated as object and as a human with feelings.karti has done a very decent job and wisely played his role. he had set the real man stand. hands off for the meaningful dialogues. it was heart touching. hands off to the actress..well dressed and had great attitude.","label":0},{"review":"to be honest, this movie is not the best for the actor karthi. and i don‚Äôt know the type of movie. we can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a romantic film because even if the story line was about the relationship between dev and meghna, it was very centered on dev. \nthe director underline the status of the woman in the society. and the character of meghna was quite good performed. different topics about women conditions were approached: the woman in workplace... \nthe love between the couple was well described and we are getting attached very easily.\nmeghna and dev are completely opposite characters but as we said opposites attract. dev is a romantic and ¬´¬†adventurous¬†¬ª and easy going versus meghna, is a businesswoman, ruthless and cold. and finally, with magic of love they are together. \nthe last point about performance. i was wondering that karthi put more effort and be more realistic. he is such good romantic and charismatic actor. if he would put more effort on action scene, it had been better. \nto be watched... i give a green thumb‚Äôs up.","label":0},{"review":"prima facie it's a love story ,however there is a deep routed human psychology spoken about ..one it portrays how a childhood atmosphere impacts the individual,especially the character of the heroin and how such situation in her life made her feel insecured about marriage and get the biased opinions about men ...no 2 the character of hero articulates how a person need to be bold and confident when you face failures in life..very in depth meaning full movie ..and practical movie,\nhats off to the director and the artist .. really worth to watch it many a times ...\nand also romantic touching scenes... awesome.","label":0},{"review":"the starting of the movie makes you think that there's something really interesting that is laying ahead...but somewhere climbing mount everest , loving a girl who is super career oriented & vulnerable at the same time by looking at her profile on fb doesn't seem to fit in altogether . though the visuals were great & acting by ramya krishnan & prakash raj were commendable as always...the movie definitely lacks the wow factor. the friendship between the 3 friends has been potrayed well. a one time watch!","label":0},{"review":"very very cool movie like paiya, kaatru veliyidai, thola & now dev.  and adventurous.  from the bottom of my heart i'm saying i love the movie...director knows exactly what he is doing till the last ...very clarity... entertainable friendship , love , fatherhood movie.... finally, you will have positive attitude & clarity of your ambition after watching this movie...like how i had more...don't miss my dear online citizens...","label":0},{"review":"wow what a wonderful plot by the director i

indeed conveys a wonderful meaning to the contemporary world.. there are certain scenes in which we can identify ourselves with the characters.. especially if you are a person who is in \"love\". cinematography is to be appreciated!  there is a bit of possessiveness,ego and a lot of love.. 3.5/5 it's a one time watchable feel good movie...","label":0},{"review":"another version of love story in the rich background. i enjoyed the movie. karthik and rakul were looking pleasing to the eyes   nothing to do for ramya krishnan and prakash raj.  adventure loving sincere,very friendly hero, falls

well as the acting. i'm sure that you would feel good after watching it. after all it is a karthi starrer, and we know according to his recent pics like kadaikutty singham, theeran adhigaram ondru, thozha etc.,we can predict that it is family friendly and a definitely feel good movie.","label":0},{"review":"to be frank, this film needs to be lot more improved in many aspects. i thought this movie will be equal to paiyaa but its not like that. very boring second half can't even sit inside the theatre and people near me started sleeping and some people got out of the theatre, and its no joke. was waiting for this movie to be get released, but got very much disappointed & music too not good by harris. only pros about this movie is there's some colourful scenes then and there, apart from that i don't find anything else","label":0},{"review":"man. you got something different to put on the screens and that's it. #dev. what a movie? who can reveal a pure love that this? story is awesome. crew did their cast in a perfect manner. i'd surely say this as a eureka of tamil cinema, where we are on the step to adventure. i'd give full marks for each and on the whole. love and adventure. rajat ravishankar. yeah he gave an adventurous approach to love.","label":0},{"review":"#dev - 2.75/5\n\nplus:\n1. karthi‚Äôs performance\n2. rakul preet‚Äôs characterisation\n3. secondhalf
