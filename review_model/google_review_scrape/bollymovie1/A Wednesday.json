[{"review":"pandey's directorial debut is one of the very best crime drama films ever made in the history of film making. propagating from the theme of terrorism and inefficient and insufficient action taken by the system and law and justice of the state, his idea of awakening the common man to revolt after he suffers  from a personal loss which is a part of a gigantic participation of antisocials in their never ending quest of killing innocents to bring what they call a 'revolution', was immaculately displayed to the audience. veteran actor shah as the fully charged common man motivated with vengeance, nails it fully with his years of acting experience and unparalleled skills. the supporting roles of kher and shergill have been more than satisfying, successfully keeping the pace and tension of the film intact. the absolutely gripping 9 minute monologue of shah was perhaps one of the most jaw dropping scenes of any hindi film ever made deserving an absolute 'cult' status. an excellently arranged plot with a really commendable screenplay succeeds in literally stalling the audience to even have a bite of nachos while watching it run on the screen. the movie also delves into the problems of police officers who face difficulties over balancing their family and professional lives as well as in facing the media which compels them to take certain actions which may result in short living but negative outcomes like the shooting of shergill's 'inspector arif khan' thereby injuring him, by bashir's 'inspector jai pratap singh' to divert the attention of the media. kher's 'comissioner prakash rathod' is shown as a man of values who understands the 'common man's' psychology and respects his steps to mitigate a problem which everyone has just seemed to either accept or approach lackadaisically. this causes him to apparently probe further into the matter making him take a gun to arrest the seemingly anarchic 'common man' though finally deciding to let him go his way, returning to his wife with a bag of groceries (a remarkably appropriate portrayal of indian husband) even after catching him red handed. a concoction of masterpieces, i give the film a bang on five on five.","label":0},{"review":"my notes on a wednesday ~ movie\nrewatched it because of that one line at the end. humans tend to search for the mazhab in the name. i wanted to see how they masked his religion plus i love the movie.\nthe j and k bag, the azaan type background score , the whole mystery of the man who is always lurking in the shadows of his men etc to give him that terrorist touch but when his wife called she did not have any muslim twang to her language, she sounded hindu. i thought it could also be that he had a love marriage and he is a muslim. it mildly occurred to me that he could be of some other religion but i discarded that...too much passion and effort...did not seem christian atleast. i now realize as i write my thoughts what i did not back then... religion is so deeply rooted in us that even a non religious person like me, is hoodwinked into this whole game sublimely.\ni love the nuances of the movie...it hits tg right spots and that also makes u realise when u have a great story , you need great actors not a star cast and the movie will work.","label":0},{"review":"excellent screenplay and storyline by neeraj pandey!
