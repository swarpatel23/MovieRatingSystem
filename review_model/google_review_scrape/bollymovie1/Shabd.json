[{"review":"award winning author , shaukat vashist's last work has been widely panned by critics leaving him frozen with writer's block for over 2 years . a new colleague yash , who gets attracted to his lovely wife antara , rekindles shaukat's inspiration , unexpectedly propelling him to write again .\n\nworking from home , shaukat benignly encourages antara's workplace-friendship with yash ( who is unaware that antara is married ).\n\nin his heart , shaukat wants antara to make the right choice & be faithful to him , though intellectually he has presented her with options ... & he himself ends up getting caught in the suspense of what antara will do & how far she will go ( though he isn't admitting that to himself - to admit that , is akin to powerlessness to shaukat , esp. since he's regained control of his writer's block by rising from the ashes as an all-powerful-author who is ' orchestrating ' events , by his ability to predict human behaviour ) in the long run however , this suspense begins to takes its toll on shaukat & partially unhinges him .\n\nhe thinks that he can cope with the possibility that antara may choose yash over him , by staying ahead of the story in real time , with his clairvoyant-like-predictions ; thus granting himself a false sense of control over the outcome ( like, if he can't control antara's free will, he can control the narrative by his superiority as an insightful author & thus give her permission by proxy - his ultimate illusion of control )\n\nthis is where his chief concern about curing his writer's block & rejuvenating his career is quickly overshadowed by his carefully-concealed-anxiety , over the outcome of the love triangle involving yash ( although shaukat is elegantly blase about it outwardly )\n\nthe two concerns get interwoven.\n\nfinally, the story he's writing is the one where antara's rejection of yash crushes him to the point where yash kills himself - this was to be shaukat's magnum opus as an author ( & validation as antara's only true love ) .\n\n\nbut in reality , yash handled the rejection maturely - subverting shaukat's expectations & ultimately precipitating his complete unhinging by making shaukat confront his lack of merlin-like-control over circumstances & outcomes .","label":0},{"review":"sanjay dutt is like the icing on the cake in this movie . what a flamboyant performance. specially in the climax he was just phenomenal. a scene where he is crying and suddenly he stares at antara(aishwarya ) and smirks, damn it‚Äôs amazing . this movie is a perfect example of his powerful acting skills. though it‚Äôs a remake but this movie is a must watch for sanjay dutt‚Äôs acting , amazing chemistry between shaukat( sanjay dutt) and antara (aishwarya rai bachchan) and the amazing screenplay. loved the movie .","label":0},{"review":"there is no spark between aish and zayed 'slove story, so it could not create emotional tie between both...sanjay dutt was superb and outstanding, well performed.. movie can be seen only for sanjay dutt and beauty of aish.. director is failed to describe on screen that what film  wants to say..","label":0},{"review":"i was amazed, no word's. excellent performance by each and every one, sanjay dutt in specific. one amongst the best screenplays i have watched. excellent tracks by vishal & shekhar. love you baba","label":0},{"review":"yesssss!
