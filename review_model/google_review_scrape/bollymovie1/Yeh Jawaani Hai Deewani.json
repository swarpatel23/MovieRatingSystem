times....it is not very often that you find a successful bollywood film that is commercial, and yet heartfelt. ‘yeh jawaani hai deewani’ boasted of all that it takes to make a typical bollywood masala film – romance, groovy music, exotic locations, a star cast to die for, popular dance numbers, even an item number by madhuri dixit. but beyond all of that, it captured the essence of life. one of the best coming-of-age movies you can find in bollywood, ‘yeh jawaani hai deewani’ captures this young and restless generation, their idea of romance, their friendships, their dilemmas perfectly well. the honesty with which it is made is what makes it so heart-warming that it is impossible not to find yourself in one of those 4 characters in the film. here are 45 things ‘yeh jawaani hai deewani’ will teach you about love, life and friendships.","label":0},{"review":"yeh jawani hai deewani\n\nit's not just a movie. it relates to all the boys who want to travel around the world and build their career in traveling. yeh jawani hai deewani has a simple story line \nnaina a simple girl who loves to study and bunny a guy who loves to travel and his friends aditi and avi. the story is that how naina and bunny fall for each other. this movie is motivational movie took\nand the songs and background music, dance was simply superb and awesome. \n \n\n\n\nsince 2013 this is my favorite movie and it will be my favorite movie ever\n\nmy feeling is that yeh jawani hai deewani is not a movie for me it is an emotion. \n\ni have watched more than a 50 times. i watched only 5 movies these many times. they are\n1) yeh jawani hai deewani\n2) 3 idiots\n3) pk\n4) bajrangi bhaijan\n5) nenu local (telugu movie) \n\nbut yeh jawani hai deewani is my favorite\n\ncelebrating 6 years of yjhd","label":0},{"review":"yeh jawaani hai deewani is one of the best movies i have ever watched. i have seen it for more than 5 times but, i could still feel the same feelings i felt the first time i saw it. what i loved the most from this movie is its dialogue or script. the lines of the characters are moving, deep and relatable. it is also more than just a romantic movie. reaching one's dreams, love of parents, loyalty of friendship and stepping out of our comfort zones are some of the themes found in this movie. cinematography is also superb. the culture of india is highlighted and the setting shows different corners of the country. hence, this movie is truly moving and deep and it can change our outlook about life.","label":0},{"review":"i feel yeh jawaani hai deewani was a wonderful movie which had a lot of expressions emotions and setting.i loved all deepika,ranbir,aditya,kalki ,mohini and the other cast .the story was very interesting when the first time i saw it you feel to see it again and again.i loved when all of you went to manali and bunny did cheating of tying a rope to naina so her team will loose i also liked the way the wedding and all the functions were organised and naina saying all the leather jacket phase,i am a painter,hair colour pink purple yellow but you know the way these people showed out their emotions i do not think any other actor or actress could do it.it felt it was all real .and in the end part i hope bunny married naina.just wish for yeh jawaani hai deewani 2.and i thank all the producers for an amazing film. specially dharma productions..\nthank you!!!!👌👌👌","label":0},{"review":"i would love to suggest everyone must watch this movie.\nromantic genre but awesome.\nanyone can watch.neither vulgarity nor unnecessary intimate

anywhere.\none of the best movies","label":0},{"review":"though the movie follows the cliched love story template, it is still an enjoyable and fun movie. \n\nhero feels that the joy is in adventure, exploring, travelling, meeting new people, keep flying and to be in the unknown but the heroine makes him realize that there is comfort and happiness to be in the known, in the company of old and dependable friends, to be in familiarity and most importantly to be in the moment because, yes, there are lot of amazing moments happening around us always but we can not be fretting about missing those moments rather we can find the joy in the moment we are in.\n\nmovie is entertaining, worth a watch.","label":0},{"review":"this movie changed my opinions about bollywood movies . until now i

in present & be happy kinda movie . all the main characters showcase different life situations how they cope up ( or don't!) but still never forgot to enjoy life ! \na must must must watch

his entire life behind his dreams....on his own.....mai udna chahata hun naina, daudna chahta, girna bhi chahta hu, bas rukna nhi chahta💕...the way he lives, his attitude, his cool dude behaviour ,

the movie focuses on either his dream to go host his show in paris (which, he apparently hasn't been to as implied by the empty page on his scrapbook) or to stay with the girl he loves. either the direct of this movie is himself oblivious or thinks of his audience as stupid and gullible","label":0},{"review":"one of the best movies in bollywood. the story revolves around bondings, passion and lifestyle. the most beautiful part of the movie is that it creates attachment and you will find yourself relating your life with that of the characters.","label":0},{"review":"this movie i have
