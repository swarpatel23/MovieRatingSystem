[{"review":"chinatown is an immense film by roman polanski. with the incredible casting of jack nicholson, faye dunaway and john huston, and the epic script that merges biblical references with ts eliot ‘s wasteland, it creates supreme allegory for human civilisation. the irony of the water engineer drowning in the midst of a terrible drought is the story of modern society. \n manorama six feet under is a creditable effort to adapt the chinatown theme from the desert of california to that of rajasthan with water and political decadence as the common theme. though it lacks the flowing quality of the polanski story and also the formidable acting talents, i like abhay deol in the low key role. he is as honest an actor as you can get amongst the modern bollywood generation. i just love that boy. \n though the film is thematically too sophisticated, the modern smart phone wielding crowd should be smart enough to enjoy it. just google chinatown to prepare yourself for this movie. even it has an important sequence playing on balak and white tv in abhay doel’s residence where polanski himself cuts the detective character’s (jack  nicholson ) nose for being a nosey fella!","label":0},{"review":"brilliant!
