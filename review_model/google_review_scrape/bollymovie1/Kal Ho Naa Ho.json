[{"review":"srk plays 'aman' (no rahul or raj) this time. it revolves around a woman's insecurities & how an angel \"aman\" enters her life to bring beautiful changes leaving lasting memories in her life. preity pulls off the role of naina catherine kapoor patel very well. saif plays a happy go lucky guy who realises value of his beloved friend naina only after she falls for aman. what thrills the audience is the unconventional ending. the songs are amazing; all of them being superhit. the dialogues are unforgettable to every srk fan. one of his best performances. \n\noverall: this classic love story is the favourite of every 20s something person. a must watch! 👌👍","label":0},{"review":"kal ho naa ho is a romantic-drama in its truest sense.this film will take you to a rollercoaster ride of heartfelt emotions like- laughter, crying and drama. all the characters specially the trio (aman,naina and rohit) and jennifer will leave an impact on you. the album is one of the greatest to come out of indian cinema. it's the album and the background score that adds up to the emotions in literally every scene. you'll just love the songs and the score. the story by karan johar is a creative genius 👏. all-in-all this film will make you cry even if you're the most rigid person. great film. 4/5","label":0},{"review":"before you all watch this movie, bring a bunch of tears for this movie is
