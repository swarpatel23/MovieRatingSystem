[{"review":"great story! abshiek bachan's acting was incredible. he has proved that he can play any role of any kind. i'm a true fan of abishiek bachan. man i miss him on screen these days. you know one more thing about abshiek bachan, ok i met him around 10 years ago in l.a. when he came to perform a show. a man came and told my parents that abhishek bachan is there and he wanted to meet me. at first i didn't believe him but i thought ok this young man might right. so, i just started following him. when we finally, reached i saw somebody opening the door, and guess what it truely was the charming mr. abishiek bachan!!!üòçüòçüòç he was looking dashing in his blue shirt and omg he was so humble. he was gracefully talking to me. i love him. the movie is very nice. anyway happy bollywood movie day to you all and be safe.","label":0},{"review":"i don't know why some of them are feeling disappointed after watching this film and saying they've wasted 3hrs of their life?\nokay, we all understand it's your opinion and you can definitely review your thoughts but it should be reasonable and clearly understandable. there's no need what so ever to blindly criticize any movie you don't like. delhi 6 is a movie which clearly tells us that how to be \"united\" and word religion shouldn't destroy any relationship or friendship. the movie also gives us an example of a black monkey which clearly indicates that in every human being there's a bad side or a demon which should be burned and shouldn't let get heavy on anyone.","label":0},{"review":"it's a great movie...very subtle.. something you can learn from. abhishek is really great and sonam too did her job well. the plot was great. i think people don't get along with subtle plots really well. this movie very artistically talks about dark aspect of human behaviour. it talks about the correct way of seeing things is based on humanity and not on religion. i thoroughly enjoyed the movie.","label":0},{"review":"i love this movie. i've watched it many times over the years and it always moves me to tears. the plot is subtle and full of meaning. it encourages you to philosophize on different issues such as religious tolerance, family values, morals, love, etc which is what a good story is supposed to do.the script is written with sensitivity and despite some of the horrendous situations that face the characters no one is completely villainized. the story tries to teach you that everyone has good and bad within them, that we are a reflection of god and the devil equally, that we are responsible of our own actions.","label":0},{"review":"great bunch of actors, everyone did there part pretty well. interesting details and film making is unique. overall its a must watch (especially a delhiites will enjoy
