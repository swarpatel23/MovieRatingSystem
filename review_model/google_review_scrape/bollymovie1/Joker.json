[{"review":"can't stop myself from talking about this one......#no_spoilers\n\ndark as hell, joker takes u through the disturbing journey of arthur fleck, from being a clown & a wanna be stand- up comedian (with only one joke in his hand.....his life) to become the \"joker\"......this journey never looked unreal though, unlike that of a hulk or a spider man....as this journey was quite human, logical and beautifully graphed and captured(of course) !!!\n\nheath ledger from the 'dark knight' was my personal favourite joker till date & joaquin phoenix took the legacy of heath to another level altogether.....that laugh, that dance, that sprint, that walk....uff....can't get over that !!!\n\ntalking about the other aspects of the movie....the background music was the soul of the movie, if not the psyche and the madness of joker itself,,,,,the cinematography, the supporting cast, the direction...everything thing was right on money , the movie very smartly dealt with the then situation of america (the gotham city),,,,,the unemployment, the raising power in the hands of the rich....all it took was a stand and a voice (be it good or bad) against the established power to become the 'hero'...which further became the reason of the rise in murders & crime in the city !!!\n\nin his small appearance, the legend robert de niro was exceptionally awesome, something that u would expect from him everytime u see him on the screen.....that small conversation at the end btwn joker and de niro was cinematic beauty and looked damn organic....an absolute treat to watch !!!\n\ndon't know about the oscars, but it was once in the lifetime performance by joaquin phoenix....and would remain in my heart for years & in my brain for days to come,,,may be.....the best portrayal of a psycho character that i have seen...was that of christian bale in 'american psycho'.....phoenix was right up there too if not above, not only the craziness, disturbance and madness but also the physical transformation was quite commendable.\n\n!! if heath has given his life for the joker then i would say phoenix has given a life to the joker !!\n\nmy one of the favourite lines from the movie was...joker saying to himself,,,\"i used to think that my life is a tragedy but now i realise that it is nothing but comedy\"....so, u can imagine how disturbing a movie could be with it's theme being 'tragedy=comedy'...but it was not that disturbing for me as i am used to of or aware of the ongoing social-political structure of our country !!!\n\nit has got those 'dark knight' (arguably one of the finest superhero movie ever made) vibes...i had an emotional ride, watching small bruce wane (nolan's batman) meeting joker, getting to know the pre batman story of the gotham city and the back story or the building-up of the 'joker the villain' of dark night.....it was quite nostalgic for me in that way !!!\n\nif i would have maximum of 5 stars to give to this movie, i would have simply divided it by zero (0).....i write about movies all the time but this one has that 'something' that forced me to type and share my views with u guys instead of writing it in my diary.....on that note i would like to finish this review with one line....\"this is the best movie in last several years that i saw....& u can't can't can't miss it\" !!!\n\n#joker_2019‚ù§‚ù§\n\n'all it takes is one bad

know this, but it‚Äôs a very artistic film, and such a fresh take on the iconic clown prince of crime that we all know and love. this movie is probably the most realistic comic book film i have seen to this day, which was an instant plus point in my eyes. first off, hats off to joaquin phoenix to portraying this complex character very well, it‚Äôs great to see how much of depth he took the character to, and not to forget, he nails the iconic joker laugh so well, which plays a major role to the character. it‚Äôs not easy deciding if he or heath ledger was a better joker, because both versions are entirely different with completely different back stories. and that brings me to my next point, the direction that todd phillips took this character to, in terms of character origin, even though it may not be comic accurate, it was executed very well. it first appeared to be a big risk that was being taken but it turned out to be a success, it is great to see something entirely different, while managing to maintain the basic foundation of joker‚Äôs character. the cinematography is another reason that makes this film worth watching, watching this movie a second time amazed me to see the countless number of unique and artistic shots that this film consists of, whether you are a dc fan, or a comic book fan in general, or even part of the audience who has never even heard of joker, you will enjoy the film because of it‚Äôs unique cinematography alone, believe it or not, i actually took screenshots of many shots from the film for absolutely no reason, but was a lot of fun. the score is another strong element to the film, the score adds a depth of intensity to every scene of the film and sends chills down your spine, and that is what we need to expect from a movie based on one of the most dangerous villains ever. the plot is very captivating, powerful , mature and thought provoking, that leave audiences in the edge of their seat. one thing that amazes me to this day is how the movie added a touch of the real world and proves such a man can indeed be created by society. i do not love drama movies to such an extent, but definitely do not dislike them, and indeed this film, in my opinion is a masterpiece. give this movie a watch. worth your time and i hope this review is helpful.","label":0},{"review":"hands down one of the most compellingly beautiful & most intricately crafted movies!! they  say the phoenix rises from its own ashes--joaquin does just that --what a flight he takes!! he evokes pathos in the most terrifying way! it is a spellbinding performance that will  remain etched in gold in movie history. the joker laugh, his walk, his dance, his antics, & then his eyes--all make you wonder why an incredible actor like him keeps such low profile. he lets his work speaks & how!! \"\ndon't compare this with heath ledger-he played the joker\";joaquin is arthur fleck and his subsequent metamorphosis into the joker! both supremely captivating acts!\nfor those self appointed critics who call it depressing & condemn the violence--there is more happening in real world countries. there is nothing  in this movie that has not been already shown on the big screen before-calling it disturbing and encouraging crime is such a biased take or are you so weak that a movie like this makes you take up crime?? what a \"joke\"!!. so many movies  in the past showing violence,gore, child abuse, sex ,etc have already won critics approval ! no critic is talking about  why arty was like that & what provoked him to become the numero uno villain in comic world. the child abuse, being played by his mother, beaten by the boys in the alley, the men on the metro ruthlessly bashing him, his co worker making him the fall guy, getting fired & of course being mocked so heartlessly by the \"suave\" murray!! if these critics go through similar situation in life--will they still remain the same people ...will they not snap?what makes them think they are good enough to judge a person who had mental illness and was pushed to dark side by ill treatment at every step of his downtrodden life??\nthat said..now does joaquin deserves oscar?--of course he does-unless the academy awards authorities are still childish enough to hold a grudge against phoenix for having called against them in the past! they already snubbed this great actor thrice--gladiator? walk the line? the master? grow up jury!\nall i can say is please don't read any reviews by  these paid critics-go, watch and decide for yourself. this is master acting -fit enough to be used as a reference in acting schools. but  then again you need to have a little knowledge about batman ,gotham city & arkham to get into it right away! being a clown is not easy..it is infact a cruel facade & this was shown in the movie -the endless tribulations & humiliations arty goes through just to keep a job he truly loves before his descent into darkness.\n an enthrallingly haunting film with stunning cinematography & an \"all stars\" performance from the spectacular mr. phoenix who really rises above all!!\ndc..please give us another enigmatic movie on the riddler...mr.e.nygma himself !","label":0},{"review":"taste is an interesting thing and, as lead protagonist ‚Äì clown character arthur fleck, played by joaquin phoenix, attests to in the latest todd phillips feature film effort: ‚Äúcomedy is subjective‚Äù.\n\ni had read many mixed reviews about the movie ‚Äì the uk lefty newspaper, the guardian, kind of slated it; it was reported in another article that large numbers of cinemagoers, in huntington beach, california usa had left the cinema moaning about excessive violence; it was said in another article to be the most disappointing movie of the year.\n\nfirst-up, this is a film ‚Äì an artistic effort and it is not to be judged on any other basis. if it moves you ‚Äì as a cinemagoer ‚Äì then director todd phillips has succeeded in his job.\n\ni had also watched various film-interpretation debates on youtube about which part(s) of the movie existed only in the lead character‚Äôs unhinged mind, or whether any of it ever really happened at all. did it really matter in terms of content i asked myself ‚Äì was it even necessary to dissect the film to such a degree?\n\nso, like eating at a new restaurant, or reading a new book, or meeting a new person for the very first time, i simply ignored all the hype and let the story unfold ‚Äì and in the most literal way.\n\narthur fleck is a failed clown and wannabe stand-up comedian who lives with his mother in a ratty apartment in downtown gotham city (a fictitious dc comics city based in the state of new jersey, usa).  essentially all clown arthur fleck wants ‚Äì is to be famous, and he will do anything to achieve his aim.  whether or not any of the action plays out in the real world, or in his mind as a psychiatric patient, is irrelevant for what the film speaks to in my mind ‚Äì which are the themes of: mental illness, unchecked ambition, celebrity culture and self-delusion. \n\nthese are important subjects which i feel ought to be discussed and addressed in modern society in the era of social media.\n\narthur‚Äôs world is a very gritty and cruel one, one where working on the streets of gotham city as a clown where during his job, trying to draw customers to a retail store, he gets beaten up by horrible teenagers in an alleyway and, where most tragically, he finds out his mother is not his biological mother, and in reality he was not conceived on the right side of the sheets during an illicit tryst between his apparent real mother and super powerful gotham city resident thomas wayne character, and that all he really is, is a dirt poor abused orphan.\n\nthat is quite a realisation for any person, and especially for mentally disturbed and failed clown arthur fleck, which events become the final crystallising moments in arthur‚Äôs homicidal serial killing revenge spree.\n\nwhat the film also spoke to, is the world of comedy and mass entertainment, which is the biggest farce of all. that making fun of sad people is unfair; yet at the same time, it makes for the very best comedy of self-deprecation when the comic does it himself, and that tragedy and comedy straddle the very same line.\n\ni enjoyed the thread that connected the dc comics batman bruce wayne‚Äôs story and arthur fleck‚Äôs joker character, whose genesis in the movie came into being right after he assassinated the famous tv comedy talk-show host character murray franklin, played by robert de niro, whom arthur fleck had idolised.\n\nthere are some black comedy genius moments ‚Äì arthur‚Äôs gun falling out of his clown outfit at a children‚Äôs hospital gig, and also where his colleague, dwarf clown gary, is simply too short to reach the apartment‚Äôs front door‚Äôs safety chain to escape with his life intact, right after arthur has brutally murdered other clown colleague, randall.   \n\nmy final analysis is ‚Äì go see the movie, think for yourself, and don‚Äôt believe the hype. the violence is not unnecessary, and it has that ‚Äú1,000 ways to die‚Äù feel to it, where social darwinism says: ‚Äúthose who deserve to die, die‚Äù.","label":0},{"review":"joker - 4/5\nground breaking performance by jaoquin best direction by todd with best casting,

the grimy, rainy streets of gotham city that shines its night lights upon bags of filth covered from ghostly white steams. a nearby taxi, riding through faceless crowds shouldered by the horror-filled echoes rousing within the walls of arkham, they roam. souls who are neither alive nor dead, they roam. they roam these streets seeking the identity that would mold and carve them out of the walls of a society that sees copies instead of individuals. that sees consumers, helpless rats that need a cure. \n\nwritten by todd phillips & scott silver, directed by todd phillips, joker tells the story of one of those roaming souls. featuring a career-best performance by joaquin phoenix, arthur fleck finds himself in the bottom of the barrel of gotham‚Äôs underbelly. arthur who has gone through parental, economical, psychological trauma, is simply a man who wants to smile. a haunted soul that would later become the joker, unraveling his philosophy throughout the streets of gotham, spreading chaos and destruction extracted from a generation of oppressed individuals. and this time, there is no costume donning hero to save the city.\n\nphillips with the aid of his production design team and his cinematographer builds a living, breathing gotham that reaks misery through its sewers and fumes, allowing phoenix to fully let go of himself as he evolves into the clown prince of crime. the score by hildur gu√∞nad√≥ttir is heavily inspired by hans zimmer‚Äôs masterful joker theme from the dark knight and though it can be a bit overpowering at times, the score capitulated the grandeur majesty that phoenix brought as joker. \n\nthe genre of comic book movies evolves one more time. if raimi‚Äôs hopeful, colorful and vibrant spider-man 2 showed the genre‚Äô power to incapsulate heroism within its canvas, and if nolan‚Äôs the dark knight trilogy showed that the genre was ready to tackle themes that rose beyond the flashy battles and caped thrills, if snyder‚Äôs watchmen showed the deconstruction of the indecency and the real humanity of a costumed hero surrounded by a cynical world, if mangold‚Äôs logan deconstructed a nearly two-decade-old icon to deliver an emotional gut-punch, if sony‚Äôs spider-verse showed how a radical change of its medium can evolve the genre, then todd phillips‚Äôs joker, is another piece of proof that the genre is at its most interesting when it embraces its versatile canvas to tell a personal story.","label":0},{"review":"it was an excellent movie but there are multiple factors to consider:\n\n(might include spoilers!) \n\n‚Ä¢this movie is extremely dark and horrifying but in a way where you still want to watch it till the end whether it's violent or horror or whatever the acting is so phenomenal to the point where your eyes are literally stuck to the screen you just can't stop watching it. \n\n‚Ä¢this movie was amazing but it couldn't ever be the way it is now without the way it was presented the way it was presented really does put an impact on the way this movie turned out. somehow the directors and producers and writers and even actors found a way to really touch the audiences and explain what the word \"psychotic\" really means! they presented it in a way where you felt sympathy for the joker but at the same time you thought that he was insane for what he was doing! \n\n‚Ä¢another thing is that this movie is dark to the point where arthur fleck (the joker) enjoyed killing because it was his way to show that people couldn't step all over him and that he would snap back! another example of how dark it is, is shown by the line \"i thought my life was a tragedy now i realise its a f***ing comedy\" imagine how dark it is to showcase that tragedy=comedy so i wouldn't recommend this movie for someone who's really sensitive and can't handle a lot of violence and torcher you could say because arthur fleck (the joker) was going though basically mental torcher. \n\n‚Ä¢maybe adding the line of one bad day would've been good because the whole movies point is that one bad day is all it takes to drive a normal person completely insane and the joker's proof of that. \n\n‚Ä¢the phenomenal performance by joaquin phoenix literally made people scared looking at him because his performance made some people think that he was actually like this in real life and to do such a performance is really legendary because i don't see a lot of actors doing that nowadays. \n\n‚Ä¢yes while this isn't the story we have all heard ever since we were little kids about the acid and all that this movie was still phenomenal in its own way because honestly it showcased the modern world how people bully others driving them insane and then question why they act that way and personally i liked this storyline better then the acid one (my opinion though everyone has there own opinion) \n\n‚Ä¢this movie made the joker relatable and i know that sounds truly terrifying but in a sick odd twisted manner it isn't like the movies where heroes save the day it really made (at least it made me) understand why the joker is who he is and why he acts the way that he does and the fact that this happens to real people is terrifying. it also shows that not every villain is responsible for the way they are because sometimes its the society that drives them psycho \n\nall points considered i would say this is a must watch movie and i definitely recommend it","label":0},{"review":"jokar \n\nthe movie, earned $500+ million till now. \nthis is another typical psycho thriller and killer movie.\n\ngreat  cinematography, shady dark ugly retro settings, and music was good for normal person. i didn‚Äôt think to get such a violent deep scary movie from a director who directed all funny movies like the hangover series..!! secondly the name of movie was quite oppotise to story. \n\nno doubt, ground breaking performance by jaoquin. the person who lost his  20kg wight for pscyhc role.  \n\nstory of  arthur fleck ( joker) \n\na person who has history of multiple psychic disorders because of his horrible childhood, his mother also faced some mental issues. arthur chooses to express his anger by

in a psychiatric ward. \n\n#personalopinion: i think, there are two ways to express extreme level of  depression, one is by killing yourself ( sucide), other is by killing those, who are reason of your depression. people reach at this extreme level, when we ignore them, we don't listen what they exactly want to say, what they want us to understand, we simply assume more, reach at conculsions. if our so called civilized society will continue, this behaviour with one another, it will lead to a dark, disorganized and full of people with paradoxical laughter only. \n\nrajwanti kumari.","label":0},{"review":"an insightful, almost painfully honest look into the issues society faces with addressing mental illness in an adequate fashion. also a believable, canon-worthy take on the potential origins of the joker as a character. \n\nwhile many have claimed that such a film may ignite waves of violence and the like, i do believe that this should also serve as an eye opener, an epiphany for how severely we fail those who do have such conditions. \n\njoaquin is mesmerising and puts in a quality of performance which, in my own opinion, rightfully deserves a mantle alongside the iconic and revered joker performances of the past. his iteration and portrayal is oscar-worthy. the imagery he puts forward for the audience is astounding, terrifying and blatantly moving. \n\nas many others have said, the score is impeccable and adds to the experience, never allowing long moments of respite from the palpable tension and decension into total anarchy and madness. the direction and cinematography come together to provide powerful visuals throughout. ultimately, this is a complete package which ranks very highly on my list of comic book movies, potentially right at the very top. \n\nin all, a must see for fans of the dc comics. a must see for those who enjoy thrillers, drama and who appreciate provocative social commentary. while it treads the line between accepting consequence and condoning violence, and does subvert those lines occasionally, our real response should be to how much more society needs to do to fully help those who suffer from mental health issues; and why we continue to act as if society is unable to provide assistance and guidance to those who truly need it. \n\n[spoiler]\nthe scene when arthur is rescued from the police vehicle and is finally given the limelight, finally taken seriously, and finally given attention for an accomplishment -despite it being a heinous and tragic accomplishment- serves as a relatable, terrifying metaphor for how often we overlook depression and mental health issues. how people who battle with these issues are only ever taken seriously and given the attention they so strongly require when they lash out, commit a horrible crime, or are no longer with us. it was in this moment when joaquin dips his fingertips in blood and pulls back the grin, this time not in the mirror but in front of actual fans applauding him, that i truly felt how perfectly he nails this iteration and role. joaquin is awe-inducing. on par with heath and jack, though i do believe the three cannot simply be compared head-to-head for a myriad of reasons and how their portrayals differ.","label":0},{"review":"i think something i always enjoy in serious movies is when it shows brutal honesty (which this movie did show) because for arthur aka the joker even though it seems harsh and cruel the world might not have anything nice to say about you and also chooses to abuse and mistreat you, even if you are a nice guy struggling to remain sane amidst your mental and psychological demons that you try your utmost to suppress but the world seems hell-bent on you giving in and succumbing to those demons. \n\nthey might rue the day they chose to kick a man when he's down and may have thought \"he's probably just a loser outcast anyway\" \n\nthis world may force you to choose an identity a sort of yin and yang if you will\nyou either choose to shoulder the burden and accept the way things are, always suppressing the injustice and the cruelty of the world, or you give in to that dark side and always live completely unhinged, never bridling any of your desires no matter how frivolous or despicable they turn out to be.\n\npossibly the quote \"you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain\" could very well be the underlying idea of this movie.\n\none thing i'll say is you never seem to know what the joker is thinking at least in my opinion i guess you could say his insanity is uniquely his own and he's the only one who can truly understand it.\n\ninterestingly this movie may leave you feeling somewhat sympathetic for him at least i felt that way. the thing that seems stuck in my head and i can't stop thinking about it is, society may in fact breed the psychopathic killers when it tries to claim that it's striving for a utopic vision. \n\ni feel quite stumped, it's hard to put a label on the joker is he a psychopath or a sociopath maybe someone far more knowledgeable on those two things could figure it out lol.\n\nin the end i'd recommend it, i'd say it's a surreal, visceral, experience and for that much i think it's worth watching.","label":0},{"review":"the standalone comic book film did a great job telling a story of a man turning into the

( if you work in an office, big office, you probably know someone like him....they will say something, just to ruin your day, to bring you down, or, simply to make you fight your colleagues /wife. )\nthe movie, so amazingly tells the story of how joker became what he is....from where he got his manipulative characteristics and how he sustains beatings... ( remember in dark knight, when bat smashes him in police station, what he replies..?? see that scene again....) it was not an ordinary talent to deliver a joker on screen that has all joker characteristics. todd phillips, well, is definitely out of hangover mood...! hats off...!!\n\nequal is background score. using just a violin, hildur has created a score, that acts like a catalyst to

joker but how he also set forward a new gotham unlike the one in previous batman issues.\n\njoker with joaquin phoenix is like a homage to moore's brilliance in every sense of word. i have been reading comic books for over two decades now and though i am more biased towards marvel to an extent i started out with dc comic though and so when i came out of the theatre after watching the sadistic madman play with vibrant colors in his own mind, i remembered my stack of batman comics that i have had over the 20 plus years and said to myself 'we finally have a joker to take dc forward' . hold on people ... i didn't say it has eclipsed ledger but it surely has done the origins story right. and in some subtle ways it did feel at time superior yo ledger. the reviews about it being more like an indie movie doesn't bother me as i don't expect gory action in an origin story of a character as sadistic , rugged and at the same time delicate as joker. \n\nphoenix can just buy himself a long vacation after this truly enthralling yet creepy performance. many seem to forget that you need a plan to make something right and phoenix might be dceu's answer to the start of a good , solid plan. phoenix's protrayal of joker is free, blatant and at times almost too real. he makes the character seem as if you will be the next to be at the recieving end of his sadistic wrath. but he also makes you feel for him as well which in itself is some feat.\n\nif you are a comic book fan you will love how the story is told in true attributes to its comic book counterpart. out of the many origins story that the joker had moore's killing joke was the best and the movie came close to it..very close. many might argue as to the fact that killing joke had very little in terms of his origins story but thats where the movie goes a step ahead albeit failing in comparision to the fun and adventurous charm the comic book had. yet it does hold its own though and the last 20 minutes of the movie leaves you with endless possibilities and clues. a death in the family scenario (of course phoenix will come back as joker in the batman movie no matter how much todd denies) or maybe an injustice league. but for all i care, we finally got something to start with in dceu unlike its shaky timeline previously.\n\n\nagain if you are a comic book fan watch it, if    you are a batman fan

in this psychological thriller movie.\n\n\nwhat to see in joker?\n\nof course, you need to see joaquin phoenix playing joker but what other things you might just love and are just perfectly sequenced & there's no part where you think that's been put to fill up the movie basically there's no fillers in it. \n\n1. amazing amazing amazing acting - \nthe way this phoenix played it is awesome. dialogue delivery is perfect & the most important that got my eyes glued to the screen was his body language if you want me to rate it it would be 11/10. \n\nthe way phoenix played the iconic joker is better than heath ledeger's.  if heath ledger's joker was 9.9 then phoenix's joker is 9.99/10. i really didn't expect that dc would find a more perfect joker...\nbut now it seems that we have the best joker in dc universe & that is joaquin phoenix.\n\n\n2.  movie direction - \nwhen did you see todd phillips directing movie like this, certainly it's not like his famous 'hangover series' . \nhe is at his best here. damn!! the movie is soo fine every scene, everything is just amazing.\n\n\n3. music -\nto a very big extent music do play a crucial role in movies.\nthe way joker slips into his character is amazing and it would not be possible to enjoy this transiton without the background score. a big shout-out hildur gu√∞nad√≥ttir for her amazing background score, it just gives you goosebumps.\n\n\n4. cinematography - \namazingly done by lawrence sher. the way he caught joker is amazing. from the dance to the hospital everything is perfectly captured. \n\n\ni think everyone out there especially the psychology students should watch this movie, the state of how arthur became the joker is very well depicted. \n\nbut at the end it leaves y'all with a thought a serious thought..\n\"thank god, gotham is not real\".","label":0},{"review":"looking at todd phillips resum√© you could be forgiven in thinking he might have not been the man for the job. you however would be dead wrong.\n\njoker is a masterpiece of contemporary filmaking. a bleak, depressing picture about the origins of one the greatest villians ever conceived, it grounds the origin story in a thrilling look at the disenfranchised, the dispossessed and the mentally ill.\n\nwith nods to scorsese's earlier works such as taxi driver and the king of comedy, joker strays from the usual fair of vibrant, explosive comic book films and  opts for a gritty re-imagining of the titular villian.\n\nthe story follows arthur fleck, a mentally ill budding comedian who struggles to find his place in a world slowly going mad. arthur's story is a bit of a whirlewind showing his battle with love, identity and society. this movie asks some hard questions about our world and arthur gradually finds answers through a string of corpses and hysterical laughter.\n\nthis movie is beautifully shot, with a subtle but atmospheric score and while it looks as if it may fall into a pretentious arthouse flick at times, its framing and setting helps ground it in reality.\n\nas you can probably imagine, joaquin phoenix carries the movie with an incredible stroke of class and and absorption, not once throughout

robert de niro¬†as murray franklin and \nzazie beetz¬†as sophie dumond to support mr phoenix in this stupendous visual treat which is weaved patiently, creatively and even romantically and it comes out as a fine work of art. i said romantically because creating a deadly evil villain and make you feel for him, sympathize for him and even make you love him is definitely not easy... and if you wanna know how it is done....watch joker. hats off to todd who is brilliantly playing the director here. the movie begins with this incredible scene of arthur painting his face, a clown. gotham is in hell of a situation, riots everywhere, sanity workers on strike and its garbage in every corner and you are introduced to one of the greatest villains in the movies...joker.\n\njoaquin is profoundly magical in every frame of this movie... his performance is going to haunt you for days. there are scenes that i wouldn't forget for a while. look at the way he runs, laughs, cries , even when he stares...the light in his eyes acts to its best ability to make you read what's in his head. phoenix breathes life into this character and watching him suffering will give you an ache somewhere deep inside. i have too many favourite scenes in the movie. one of them is when arthur confronts mr wayne in a theater toilet, other one is when arthur appears on the tv talk show and the one filled my heart in is the scene where joker draws a smile on his face with blood. i can go on talking about joaquin's performance... its mesmerizing and it's undoubtedly one of the greatest performances i have ever witnessed. \n\nthe music is aching and it connects you directly to arthur's head...robert de niro charms the character he plays and every other actor in the movie has done an incredible job. but phoenix stands out like the sun and he shines throughout the movie. you even get to see batman, though he is a child , i could hear the entire cinema cheered on that scene. this movie is phoenix's movie... my heart has already given him an oscar and a long standing ovation for living joker and for making me fall in love with the character he played. don't miss it. i'm going with 4 stars.

this movie answers a lot about this unortodox origin.\n\none thing that i missed from this movie is that joker didn't say one of his staple quotes:\n\"all it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man to lunacy, this is how far the world is from where i am, one. bad. day\"\nit would fit perfectly somehwere in the end, maybe when he's with murray, or somewhere else. but it's a small con around big pros.\n\nthat's what this movie is about. how a sequence of bad events (to put it lightly) can make an already unstable person to full blown psychosis.\n\nto put it as a \"incel motivation to start a killing spree\" or \"a white guy angry with the world\" is to view a masterpiece like this one in a simplistic way. those type of critics just shows how overpaid mainstream opinion makers are, with their butt hurt feelings because this movie is far away from some utopia or fails to deliver a message, whatever it means. it not only delivers, it makes you want to clap after it's finish.\n\nif you are familiar with the dc universe, think about this joker origin as a character of earth-1283 where the story is diferent than earth-1 (the original story), so you are not to attached to the details, just on the character development and the events that occur. maybe that's something that the overpaid critics lack to understand.\n\nthe movie showing the link between bruce and arthur is outstanding, making us understand (in this outside the box narrative) how joker becomes so obsessed not only with batman but also bruce. even that is covered, which was a great surprise, a well written surprise.\n\na must watch, an instant classic. the staircase scene where he comes as the joker before arriving to the talk show, or when he lits a cigarrete after leaving the subway are scenes that will live through generations.\n\nlast thing, can't compare to heath ledger, as joaquin's joker is an origin while ledger is already the fully develop clown prince of crime. i don't expect phoenix to receive an oscar for this great performance (movie doesn't follow hollywoods checklist), but i hope that he at least gets nominated, even though he probably doesn't care.\n\nthe hype was

what the good means, like without dark we will not appreciate light or absence of it. in my opinion \"joker\" aims to unhide, unfortunately the true nature of human being. since when you see in human

from the most violent film i've ever seen (rambo last blood was straight up murder porn for the final 20 minutes) and the media is going out of it's way to sell the idea that seeing it in a theater full of people will somehow put lives at risk. we live in a country where going to get groceries or going to an elementary school might be the last thing you ever do. it's irresponsible to keep pushing this narrative and just plain wrong.\n\n2. people are saying that joker makes you feel for the villian in the movie thus causing you to root for the murdering clown. without spoiling it, yes you can't help but be sympathetic towards arthur and the horrible events that took place early on in his life but you definitely shouldn't be rooting for him once a specific line is crossed. if you do find yourself rooting for him after said line crossing, it may be time to talk to someone about what's going on in your life. seriously.\n\nwith that out of the way, i've spent the past 36 hours thinking about this film. \n\nit's shot beautifully, the score is haunting and incredibly effective and joaquin phoenix delivers an absolutely powerful performance as the incredibly damaged arthur fleck.\n\nwhat needs to be in the conversation surrounding this film is mental health services, class disparity and above all else apathy and the effects it has on our society as a whole.\n\nthe movie holds up a mirror to society and it seems quite a few people aren't liking what they see. i have a suggestion for all of the people prejudging the film or just saying that it glorifies violence, go out and try to empathize with your fellow man. see what you can do to lift up those that are destitute and powerless. try to provide some positive reinforcement and above all else just see people because more than anything people just need to be seen (and heard).\n\nin short, i loved this film and i was seriously uncomfortable for the majority of it as i think you are supposed to be. that's how i know todd philips and company knocked this out of the park. i can't help but think it will earn joaquin phoenix an oscar nomination. he is now tied with heath ledger in regards to the best

(pseudobulbar affect if i'm not mistaken ) , the film also adds the unreliable narrator aspect ( where the camera can show you something that either isn't real or isn't happening) , besides that the acting is phenomenal , joaquin phoenix really brings his a game , showing arthur fleck as a loving , kind individual that just wants to make you laugh but is beaten down by an ever changing society that both beat him down and in the end breaks him . this movie also adds the idea of the \"one bad day\" theme from the killing joke comic where in the comic joker says and i quote '' all it takes is one bad day to bring the sanest man to lunacy \" and it takes that idea and brings it to the forefront . in conclusion i think joker was beyond amazing , between the acting , music score and set pieces it was a wild (and scary) ride . symbolism also sneaks into the movie with slight things you wouldn't notice upon first watching . this movie leaves you confused on what was real and what

essence is a masterpiece. like every scene is a part of a jigsaw puzzle and all the pieces fall right into place, todd has made sure you see it happening. to talk about joaquin phoenix as a comic book fan i think the biggest compliment i can give him is that he's finally a joker worthy enough to be compared to the great mark hamill, his laugh haunts you, he manages to express his laughs in all situations and you feel it. i'd be lying if i said it didn't give me chills. the last time something like this happened was when i saw batman, mask of phantasm. joaquin's acting is top notch and this is the first movie i've seen of his, and i'm gonna zip through his other movies soon. the point of this movie is that it is gripping and it manages to hold its viewers, let it be through todd's vision, joaquin's acting or the music. it has all the right elements mixed precisely, and it makes you one with the character, i for once couldn't stop myself from dancing in my seat because the music is great and joaquin is magnetic. if you love dark humour you will love this movie, if you don't like joker states \"you wouldn't get it\". comic book fans would know joker does not have an origin

masterpiece provided by todd phillips and the oscar worthy joaquin phoenix. following it‚Äôs well anticipated expectations, joker exceeds what we believed it was to be, it was nothing short of amazing. this depiction of the joker based on dc comics allowed writers to experiment with different aspects of the mentally ill man and how he copes with the world around him attempting to fit in. partnered with the original taxi driver himself, robert deniro, this thriller is complete with a dark, psychological, chilling sense of what it is like to look out arthur fleck‚Äôs window of life. \n\nthis is the tale of the darker side of gotham you needed to know of that breed men like arthur fleck. a grimacing look into the  gritty 70s where poverty and systematic oppression rules the lower class. we are witnessing the destruction of a man in his battle versus the world. the grip on sanity that arthur fleck holds already has a slippery grip with his laughing condition and delusional happiness. follow this by a cutthroat society and a few consistent wrong turns in life fueled by rejected/negative relationships, the true cruelty of man, and a system that cares very little about those on the bottom, and you receive those like arthur who evolve into joker.\n\nexpecting the mentally ill to act as if they don‚Äôt have a mental illness creates societal pressures and that‚Äôs exactly what phillips is offering here as we witness the world within the movie represent an aspect of the larger world we live in today. a society full of union strikes, budget cutbacks in departments beneficial to the suffering, and a job market that doesn‚Äôt seem to be catering to anyone but those already employed; this is the world around arthur fleck as he grows to become more isolated and mentally ill. the continuous acts of violence makes arthur feel in control and that leads him to developing the joker as his alter ego. \n\nmusically, we are guided through arthur‚Äôs mind as every mishap pays a great due to his actions as the reactions of the world come face to face with him day in and day out. it almost pains us the way the music creeps along with the acting of joaquin. the songs chosen are more old and straight to the point, the lyrics describe everything. it helps us sympathize with his developing careless ways understanding that he is a victim taking control and unknowingly becoming the face of revolt and chaos. \n\ncinematically this is a real eye pleaser as we watch the hazy grim grit of cinematography that graces this film along with its amazing actors. every frame and lighting compliments the issues at hand within the movie and connects us directly into the situation as if we were there. if this film were placed on mute, we can still sense the grit and emotion of the scenes due to the cinematography and lighting, especially the intro scene witnessing a the joker apply his make up forcing himself to smile while tearing. \n\nlastly, joaquin phoenix has single handedly put on a show for us like no other. even without camera focus or close ups you know how deep in character he is due to his beautiful intense body movement. the interpretive dance through scenes shares with us a secret in arthur fleck‚Äôs life, that among his issues, he is in his own world and he is the star of it...no matter what the real world says. he stuck out like a sore thumb the entire movie with his odd ways and welcoming voice, we saw the sweet idea of a man in the slums birth the idea of a chaotic ring leader of gotham. small things like his tone when saying punch line jokes, the way he runs, consistently falling in situations, the dancing, the different ways of his offbeat laughter, it was all just magical to watch a man become a villain through joaquin phoenix‚Äôs portrayal of the joker. \n\njoker scores a highly deserved 9.5/10 as you will see from start to finish that this movie should be in discussion for top film of the

arthur. the nolan's trilogy was a huge success and loved among the fans till date because it had a similar approach by making a batman film in a more realistic and a believable tone by making him more vulnerable to punches, guns, knives, dogs[;)] instead of making him more pumped up with too many gadgets, armor and fighting against the unbelievably strong godlike villains with his infinite stamina,

and beyond my expectations - i think this is the best performance i have ever seen from him. the comparisons i have seen between him and ledger are unfair in my opinion: they both portrayed very different parts of the joker's history, and they both did an incredible job.\n\nthe compassion and empathy i had for arthur moved me to tears. it was very emotional to watch, and probably would contain many triggers for people with past experiences of abuse. without exploring his history in detail here, his background resonated with me. his family history and present situation, employment circumstances, bullying and ostracism (both the overt displays and more subtle, insidious ones), deterioration in stability, dissociation and delusion, fury and hopelessness, and even his laughter. i do not have the same condition, but i have a history of laughing or smiling inappropriately in extremely uncomfortable situations (i lost a friend over it a long time ago), when i found nothing funny about them. i felt immense guilt, shame and questioned my morality whenever this occurred. \n\ni understand that feeling empathy for someone who commits murder doesn't sit well with people. i do not condone the character's actions or intend to minimise the devastating impact these crimes leave behind. i simply deeply empathise with how arthur felt in the build up to that (although i do feel that the sequence of events in the first 30-40 minutes were a little rushed - more development would have been better in my opinion). i desperately wanted to comfort and support arthur, before he reached that point. it was captivating yet heartbreaking to witness him descend deeper and deeper into a pit of despair and madness that he couldn't crawl out of. throughout the film, i wished that someone noticed the warning signs earlier and cared enough to do something. \n\nhaving been a support worker for people who committed various, serious offences - and raised within a family that has a dark history of abuse, crime and violence - i understand the sequence of events that can potentially lead to these consequences, without excusing or justifying them. i can even see how my own decisions and outcomes could have been dramatically different and i'm very grateful that i was able to choose an alternative way of life. common themes for many of those i supported - which were also present in the film - were a perpetual cycle of abuse passed from generation to generation, violence being normalised within social circles, poverty, isolation and inadequate intervention.\n\ni like how the film looked at mental health provisions, austerity and how the system fails people. it also addressed the detachment and disconnection between service providers and service users in a relatable way. i felt arthur's alienation and frustration. it's painfully pertinent to our current circumstances here in the uk.\n\nunlike other critics whose reviews i have read, i didn't feel arthur was nothing more than a bitter, entitled white man with a gun (although there was certainly an element of that, deliberately i suspect - the film unravels like a social commentary). i understand their perspective, but this

of those who hurt others.\n\na very moving, very bold and very important film.","label":0},{"review":"as phoenix falls down in a garbage lined piss filled street ( vadivel s usual home) in a perfectly framed shot and the title appears , my fears started.. i was expecting this origin story to mine deep into a violent mind. somehow i couldn‚Äôt figure whether it was or was it merely pretending to be one. the writing somehow loses the larger moral framework, for his mind to operate when it stopped pretending to be analytical and it started to wolf whistle for it ( along with all those young boys in the theatre). this is scorcesse s home turf and he could ve done some magic..\ninspite of this disconnect, i loved the movie which had some beautiful cinematic moments and a knock out interpretation by phoenix.  my favourite was one before the theater screening modern times..where the joker silently cherishes his role as a man who started the clown rising without anyone going to ever realize that. the sequence was powerful and moving. the other massy sequence when he rises among the clowns somehow pales before this one. there was an incredible sense of irony when the clich√©d image of a clown with tears is brought against joker‚Äôs condition of being unable to stop his laughter. if you could still empathize him at the end when he says that he never had √† happy moment in his life and when he walks down the steps after he assumes his iconic make over and feeling truly liberated , you are bound to be sucked inside the nihilistic universe of the movie. somehow, in trying to portray the pointlessness of an exploiting society, i felt that the whole point of the movie actually began to look part of it. does it expect us to do some meta reading..  it s a scary thought though that we are able to stand in the gallery and cheer for joker as he tumbles down deep into the realms of moral breakdown...and the standing for the national anthem on  gandhi jayanthi day at the beginning of the show seemed to be ages ago..üòë","label":0},{"review":"**no spoilers in this review**\n\n\"joker\" is a dark, depressing, and occasionally violent character study about a man with mental health problems who is essentially failed by both the political and socio-cultural systems, with devastating results. \n\nwarner brothers tried to get the project to go away by tossing a shoestring budget at it, but it ended up being further proof that audiences are open to the progress that unconventional filmmaking offers. \n\n4.5/5, minus a half point because of very minor things like hand-held cam movement, occasionally heavy-handed cinematography with use of color, etc., but nothing huge, just my film student days haunting me, haha. other than those few picky things, the film is a slow-burning observational character study that hits all the right notes perfectly with impeccable pacing and strong elements as far as the score, cinematography, editing, script, etc. \n\n\"joker\" kept me engaged for the full duration of the running time, and i'm the type who can be brutal with movies and have no problem with dumping a dud after the first twenty minutes if it starts to stink. i can somewhat agree with the critics who say that the twists can be a bit predictable, but i think they're supposed to be, because they want to keep the majority of the audience engaged vs alienate crowds by getting too \"artsy\"; i had no issues there. \n\nyes, joaquin phoenix gives the best performance of his career; todd phillips does a solid job of directing although not \"auteur level\"; hildur gu√∞nad√≥ttir is definitely a name to follow with her amazing film scores, also. \n\n leading up to seeing the film, i couldn't refrain from indulging in some of the waves of \"joker\" clickbait articles, many of which were surprisingly negative. complaints about slow pacing (if you want to see truly slow pacing, watch an ingmar bergman or bel√† tarr film and you'll see that \"joker\" isn't too slow-moving), racism, a shoddy script, etc., mostly seemed like article authors playing the \"negative edginess clicks\" game to get paid, after all the waves of initial reviews were so positive. i can also see a lot of right-wing extremist types getting offended by the film's message.\n\nthe pacing is exactly as it should be and i think people expected editing beats more similar to what's in \"the dark knight\" absolutely got thrown off with \"joker\". i get that most people aren't accustomed to slower \"art house\" pacing after often being bombarded with close to fifty cuts in a minute of tv/film vs well under that in \"joker\". \n\nas far as the argument involving phoenix's character being labeled an \"incel\" who is just another white man complaining about how hard he has it in life while he continually is brought down by people of color... i can agree in a small way in that, sure, arthur is a white male and thus inherently reaps the rewards of privilege, but only in it's most base forms. he absolutely still is a person who suffers in life as a member of the poor class who is a victim the various repercussions of the greed of the 1% at the top of our capitalist system, and of the shoddy mental health system, in particular. \n\nthe majority of us feel arthur's pain of the everyman/person and disdain for the obscenely rich in one way or another, and that is a major connective point with the audience.\n\n\"joker\" isn't perfect, but its flaws meld with the battered and broken soul of the film, phoenix's performance is one of the best in the 2010's, and the film's main theme of revolt against controlling oppressors branches out into many other themes that stem from oppression in its various forms. \n\nhopefully \"joker\" isn't a glimpse into the near future of our own society, if politics and capitalism continue to leave the majority of us behind...","label":0},{"review":"loved it,it's an incredibly dark comedy ,i was the

2019,\n\nbefore i start i would like to say that i thoroughly enjoyed your film and the new interpretation on the clown prince of crime. this is a new side of movies that i have never seen, taking on a whole new personality in the way that it mainly focused on the villian himself and understanding his personality and humanising him in the eyes of billions around the world. rather than going for a western type plot where a bad guy turns good and gets his happy ending, this movie went in depth with dc‚Äôs most notorious villain and actually explains why the villain became the villain for a valid reason. with most villains, they always show the more sinister side to them and are always made to be despised by the audience due to their horrendous actions and how they try to interfere with the protagonists ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù. in this film you can feel what the joker goes through and the challenges he faces that change and alter his personality when he tries to find light in the never ending tunnel of darkness, perfectly expressing the feeling of loneliness and helplessness that everyone feels when challenged with a difficult situation that is impossible to deal with. despite trying to find some semblance of hope and meaning in the world, he faces everything with one big smile and tries to laugh off his fears and anxiety. by doing this he hopes that everything would be better but nothing ever went his way as society rejects him and doesn‚Äôt give the help that he so desperately needed.\n\nnow as a fan i have always grown up with superhero films and have always watched the hero overcome overwhelming odds despite their qualities and super human abilities. this is the first time that i have seen the main character (associated with a superhero franchise) lose his self worth, respect and sanity molding him to become the man that took on the batman. despite this being a dc associated film, at its core it perfectly expresses the challenges and issues that many people face today and sinks us back down to the reality that not all impossible odds can be won. that with each experience it can leave some kind of everlasting impact on us and how we view the world as a whole through our own eyes, giving ‚Äúlife‚Äù it‚Äôs meaning. after watching this film i can honestly say that this is the first film that literally put me to tears. it isn‚Äôt that i felt bad for the bad guy, nor was it the fact that i saw a man‚Äôs self worth be torn in front of my eyes, but i could relate to him on an emotional level and understand his struggle. \n\nthough truthfully i never felt i had the compolsion to dress up as a clown and murder hundres of people i could understand how he felt throughout the film. as an adult entering society, i had to deal with my fair share of difficulties and i can honestly relate to the main character and understand the reason why he laughs the way he does when faced with a difficult and stressful situation. dealing with things like that can really break someone and can honestly feel like you're losing your mind. the way that the writer and actor expresses those ideas through the correct emotional connotation, really captivated me as a viewer as i felt i was not watching a dc film any longer but a film about the challenge and changes that we all go through as individuals, trying to leave our mark on the world despite it looking so bleak and hopeless. i believe that a writer expresses who they are through their work and i can honestly say that i am happy that i‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way.\n\nthank you so much and keep up the amazing work,\n\nsincerely,\n\nyour biggest fan","label":0},{"review":"joker pushes the boundaries of what the comic book genre has long-established. it‚Äôs a gripping, next-level

few whole-heartedly step outside the box and transcend out of the genre into something greater, joker is undoubtedly one of these films.\n\npros\njoker falls into this category of thought-provoking films with its general tones (thanks to the gorgeous cinematography) and overarching themes of the actions taken when a person reaches their breaking point. philips and phoenix have managed to craft a tragic character who we sympathize with, but also understand his reasons for turning to a life of crime. it‚Äôs not to say that those actions should be praised (controversies aside), but rather as an example of an unfortunate transformation. philips also doesn‚Äôt look to be bound by any source material from the comics, which, in turn, changes the origin of the character. if anything, this film

classics like old school and the hangover trilogy and critically acclaimed actor joaquin phoenix, on a project based around one of comics greatest characters. the answer: one hell of a movie!\n\nsynopsis - forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian arthur fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of gotham city. arthur wears two masks -- the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he's part of the world around him. isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the joker.\n\nthe man who laughs - heath ledger had brought something new to role, same goes for jack nicholson and now, the exact same can be said for joaquin phoenix. arthur fleck is a damaged man, both physically and mentally, barely holding back the tears with uncomfortable laughter. phoenix plays the title character with a true sense of realism and utter sadness. never having a true loving or nurturing figure in his life, fleck is a spiraling man, slowly falling down this twisted crime-ridden rabbit hole. when it comes to oscar season this year, my vote is locked in. joaquin phoenix does a career best turn as the clown prince of crime and is truly deserving of the best actor win.\n\nblood and laughter - controversy has filled the newsstands and posts centered around joker, mostly about the violence and actions within the film. from a personal standpoint, the violence within the film is poignant and fits the story. blood is shed but certainly not as much as say the hateful eight or drive. the controversy around the film is fairly pretentious in my opinion. its the age old argument that has been plaguing the entertainment business for years: does violent content cause violent actions. the answer for me at least is a resounding no. \n\na beautiful shot in the dark - the film masterfully directed by todd phillips, who crafts it like a true auteur of filmmaking. the colors are vibrant and the pallet beautiful. the shot choices by both phillips and cinematographer lawrence sher are extremely well chosen. dark blues and greens cascade the screen in the dark gotahm nights and during the day bright reds and oranges fill the canvas. not only is the film a masterfully crafted in acting and story but is also beautiful to witness. \n\na score to settle - a hauntingly beautiful score is laid out by the films composer hildur gu√∞nad√≥ttir, an icelandic musician and songwriter who recently started doing big time films. the score is amazingly crafted, with a low gutteral violin playing prominently throughout. it's one of those scores where if you just listen to the music you get how the story is going to unfold. \n\nthat‚Äôs life - joker was my most anticipated film of the year. when i found out that long time favorite actor joquin phoenix was going to portray the classic villain i was giddy at the thought. and, with the masterful direction of todd phillips and a fully committed career best performance from its lead, joker 2019 is officially (my opinion) the best film of the year!\n\ni am proud to award

that leaves you speechless and makes you wonder how such a cinematic achievement can truly exist.no matter if critics hate it or love it , its unanimous that joaquin has given the performance of a such unmatched degree that even heath ledger's portrayal though believed to never to be surpassed is matched and can potentially exceed that of the clown prince of crime in the dark knight rises. the fact is you are going to be stunned by this performance because this movie is discomforting,dark, gory, bleak and brings the dark side of human mind but still you cannot, i repeat, you cannot take your eyes off joaquin phoenix's performance. this is a story that it is so much grounded and believable that it does not feel like a comic book movie. but i tell you all the audience and batman lovers will be pleased . batman fans know that joker keeps his story multiple origin and this movie does that in such a genius level that you need to process the facts and give the whole movie your thoughts and time to truly distinguish how can such a masterpiece even exist. let me tell you one thing that some critics hated it but those who loved gave it 5/5 or even better 10/10 and the venice film festival golden lion award as well as the 8 minute standing ovation tells us something. more over don't expect the dark knight's joker as this is his origin, he is finding his way and in that search he falls in the abyss of his broken mind and finds meaning in chaos and anarchy and destruction of the society that created and pushed him over the edge. this guy does not want to kill everyone but this guy wants to kill everyone who is awful to him and that is a lot of people. this portrayal of joker for me is different and at the top because he has sympathy with the people, that is, he still has humanity and believe that people  that prey on the weak and challenged should deserve some really bad punishment . he wants to show that the elite created the rules of the society where it keeps them happy and safe whereas the people that work for them and make them rich are left miserable and unhappy. he wants to show society should care for everyone and since it does not people are gonna rise and fight and kill for their happiness and meaning and take power from the few and give it to all. he is to prove that he exists and the society that tried to prove that he does not will face his wrath and he does that. he gave the world laughter and joy in a dark way . if you are reading something this long then please put the effort and watch the movie joker and after watching it you will be asked about it and your response will be,\"ladies and gentlemen , that's life\". thank you .","label":0},{"review":"without going into immensely drawn out thoughts of how individuals with mental illness are viewed, examined, then shelved and basically forgotten other than becoming statistics. i think this movie was one of the greatest reimaginings of a live action dc comic book villain origin story ever on the big screen. it holds true to what, at least i always imagined, gotham city to have been like in a real life scenario. as well as the trials and struggles that may lead to the mental hatred of those with undeserved power. it shows how fragile the human mind can be after a lifetime of abuse, neglect or being taken for granted and pushed away like they don't matter. for cinematic purposes, i truly hope that any and all dc films that come after this, keep up with this type of storytelling and takes the batman to the next level where he has always belonged. it's obvious bruce wayne also has severe mental illness due to trauma he has witnessed and/or experienced, same as joker, but has simply chosen a different outlet or path. \n( potential spoiler warning ahead) \nbeing presumed \"brothers\" by a mentally unstable outcast shunned, disregarded and pushed away by anyone in a seat of authority may shine a very bright light on the story behind the biggest comic book rivalry ever imagined. the feeling of hatred toward the boy who had been provided with everything and given every chance by a man who should have done the same for him. whether it's the truth or just hallucinations as indicated. joker is sure to know exactly who the batman is when he finally arises. and so begins the fighting, unable to destroy one another fully because of a bond that batman feels but doesn't know. batman only blames joker, and his actions, for being the breaking point of already unruly and unstable protesters, beginning the chaos. ultimately this led to the lifelong mental trauma young bruce endures by witnessing his parents gruesome murder. if the batman stays true to this story line, i can't wait to finally see a truly dark batman story born from trauma enduced mental illness, focusing partially on the constant battle inside of himself. fighting ultimately to not turn into the people he hunts and locks away. i hope this makes sense for the most part.","label":0},{"review":"this was one of the most unique pictures i've ever seen. you usually never see the perspective of a villain or someone as mentally ill and murderous as the joker. it was definitely one of the best pictures i've seen this year although it was a little slow paced at some points but overall it was very good and interesting to see that perspective. i rate this picture a 9.87/10 and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to see a picture from a unique perspective and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good picture.\n\nupdate: i have recently watched the picture for a second time since i admittedly fell alseep for a couple of seconds during my first viewing due to me seeing it really late at night but i did still enjoy it as much, and even more the second time. you have to remember that this isn't a superhero movie, it's a story about a mentally ill man and what its like to be mentally ill so there isn't any superhero vs supervillan or superhero saves the girl action or even as many cop chase scenes that we're used to seeing from a superhero/comic book movie which makes it unpredictable. thats what makes this picture so unique and i actually am going to raise my rating from a 9.87/10 to a 9.95/10 because if you take a moment to take it all in and don't go very sleepy then you should be able to fully appreciate this picture. i'd probably give it a 10/10 but i mistakenly went too late at night the first time. i only missed a scene or two but when i watched it the second time i already knew what the big shocking climax was, preventing me from fully enjoying and being super suprised. i now would recomend this picture to everyone and believe that the picture and joaquin phoenix should be nominated and win every award associated with film and acting since it was really that good. i'd even go on to say that this picture was better than avengers: endgame and is the best picture of

'joker' is such a powerful yet poignant experience, that within 10 minutes of the movie it was very clear that i am watching a masterpiece. although it takes the content and the premise from the batman comics, it never gives a single moment of pleasure of reading comic book. it does not give any pleasure at all. \n\nthis movie takes on the origin story of a maniac serial killer from a very humane angle. the character of arthur fleck is so commonplace that you almost instantly relate to the vulnerability of it. you can always imagine yourself in those same situations where you have nowhere to run. your environment, your society beats you to pulp, yet you don't have the courage to give it back to the people whom it came from. joker delves in that dark dejection and brings up the murderous insanity which on a bad day can get the better of you. arthur fleck tried his best to keep his world smiling but the world never smiled back at him. instead it thumped him so hard that nothing but emotional tar had come out in the form of a delusional murderer. \n\nthe violence in this movie which has created a major controversy worldwide is not about blood and gore. it is rather so psychological that everybody can feel a bit of joker in himself. i never believed a movie can affect a normal person so much. well, this movie can. the infamous \"bathroom scene\", which is already being touted as the most disturbing scene ever created, is astonishingly eerie. the background score is so sinister that you can feel the chill in your bones. no cgi, no special effect was needed. a very bleak dance coupled with an evil piece of music in a gloomy bathroom was enough to herald the emergence of a frightening monster. such was the power of it, one could hear muffled cheers and gasps from the audience simultaneously. \n\ndirection, cinematography, plot development, usage of old classics like smile, everything about this movie is art at its purest. but what takes the cake, is joaquin phoenix's performance. words fall short to describe this act. the calm yet mad look in his eyes, unmindful eerie pauses, tired body language create a visual poetry of insanity. his borderline spastic style of dialogue delivery pens such a requiem for his innocence that one can't stop feeling bad for arthur fleck.to be very honest i have never been overwhelmed by heath ledger's joker. it had its moments, in some places ledger's acting was really brilliant. but it lacked the emotion, the depth. ledger's joker was one dimensional. it was a villain through and through. there was never a second's space to relate otherwise. phoenix's joker gives us that space. such is the extent of empathy it evokes, that the audience almost root for his crimes till it becomes so shocking that nobody could take it anymore. as i said before, within ten minutes of starting, the performance of phoenix reaches an astronomical level which has rarely been touched by anybody. phoenix delivers at that level for two very long hours. this deep, dark portrayal of a fragile psyche will certainly be regarded as one for the ages. phoenix has cemented his status as an all time great with this. \n\nit will be very lofty to hail this movie as one of the greatest i have ever seen. but 'joker' provided somewhat like a twisted cerebral catharsis, which i never experienced before. that said, joker is an uniquely personal movie, which must not be watched with your famiily.               \n

him to lose it completely and become the villain we all know as joker. the movie in its 2-hour runtime focuses completely on arthur fleck and shows his descent into becoming the joker and that journey is very well showcased, sometimes it is so realistic that some might consider it almost horror-like. the main credit goes to joaquin phoneix for such brilliant acting definitely oscar-worthy, he is the main reason that the journey is believable you may feel bad for the character but you will also be able to feel the darkness deep inside which endorse his actions, the darkness which is slowly unravelled throughout the span of the movie. the rest of the supporting casts were great as well especially robert de niro.\n\nthe movie is directed by todd philips who before this had only directed movies like hangover and due date. this movie was a great departure from his usual type of movies but he pulled it off, you could tell he is a big scorsese fan as this movie is heavily inspired by taxi driver. like taxi driver this movie is a bit of a slow burner and slowly picks up the pace which really helps in understanding the character a lot better especially since this movie was a character study. as the descent into madness started so does the pacing of the movie.\n\nthe cinematography was very beautiful, the tone of the movie really helped in showcasing the deteriorating gotham and characters. the soundtrack of the movie was also very good again i think it was very similar to taxi driver, it wasn't omnipresent, though when played it increased the tension very easily.\n\ni am really glad that a movie like this exists. when comic-book movies are so saturated it is important that we have directors and actors who take risks like these. projects like these (if successful) could break the monotony that has shrouded the comic-book genre. you may not end up liking the movie but that should not stop you from recognising it for its uniqueness and its bold take. having said that i really loved this movie to bits and would love to see it again and again for its mesmerising performances, beautiful cinematography, lovely score and especially for its unique take.","label":0},{"review":"watched joker yesterday. honestly speaking it was a script like typical bollywood masala hindi film of 80s in which the hero of a film is very ordinary guy of slums and doomed in dark since his birth who turns out to be a supervillain or angry young man as he grows up. but i must say that joaquin rafael phoenix has borne an ordinary script on his extra ordinary shoulders. i was awestruck as to how can one act with such niche and flawlessness? on the surface it will look like a film which glorifies the villain and justifies his gruesome acts but when we watch it carefully we will find how our small laughter on someone's particular condition can create a havoc in the mind and soul of a person who seems to be not minding his constant criticism and that too when he is not at all responsible for his condition to take such criticism. phoenix is the superhero of this super villain saga. i felt robert de nero could have been utilised in a better way. direction and cinematography is mind blowing background score is outstanding...film is very slow though ...sometimes you feel like the film is overstretched but the joker keeps you glued to your seats with his dark, scary and utterly disturbing dance and body moments. i think phoenix deserves oscar for this performance. its totally his film write.","label":0},{"review":"i finally got around to watching this movie and am sure glad i did. i am usually very critical of anything warner/dceu material for reasons that would take too long to enumerate. i also don't rely on any \"tomatometer critics\" ever. basically, if critics on the tomatometer say a movie/tv show is bad, that usually means the movie/tv show is good if not great and vice versa, if the tomatometer critics say a movie is good, it usually means it's a bad movie/tv show. therefore i don't rely on critics if they are not from independent normal viewers like little ole me. any ways, back to the \"joker\", warner/dceu hit it out of the ball park. all thanks to whom ever decided to cast phoenix for the role of \"joker\". joaquin absolutely kills it as the joker, i mean after watching this movie, i can't see anyone else play the joker after this. phoenix takes it to a completely next level acting wise. his performance combined with great writing/story telling takes us on an amazing origin story of just how the joker came to be. the entire movie is about developing the dc character that is the \"joker\", which would usually bother me because the usual origin and development stories take too much time out of the movie. but this one is all about the deep origin of the joker and shows so many issues that made him who he is and his disconnection with reality and how the darkness within him came to be. bottom line, the \"joker\" is a must see dceu movie and if you read any of my critics, you'll see i am very harsh in my critics and only recommend movies/tv shows only if i am absolutely certain it's a winner or a loser. this one is a winner period!! worth spending your money at the theater for sure. on another quick note, this movie proves you don't need a $200 + million dollar budget or over produced cgi and most of all, any political/gender identity agendas to make such a movie successful. final note: and the oscar for best actor in a leading role goes to.... joaquin phoenix !!","label":0},{"review":"incredibly directed and the visuals match. if you are like me and american psycho is one of your favorite movies then you might leave this movie with your mind blown. the actors were all nothing shy of perfection and you will ride a psychological and emotional wave through the first half of the movie. if you know anyone with any kind of personal struggles with mental illness you will feel more than a few strong emotions before the second half when everything peaks. i walked out adding this to my list of all time favorites alongside the dark knight rises, interstellar and american psycho. it deserves its rated r rating that's for sure but i'm glad to have gotten the full movie/story of this character because it was absolutely necessary. it ties into the back story of batman and really puts a cherry on top of all the other movies. at moments it is dark, deep, and twisted but overall i don't know what more you could ask for from an authentic joker movie. simply fantastic and for someone who only goes to theaters for specific movies, i'm definitely glad this was one of the ones i chose to go out and see.
