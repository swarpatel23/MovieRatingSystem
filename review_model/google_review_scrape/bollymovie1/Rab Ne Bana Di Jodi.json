[{"review":"oh my gosh, this movie is sooo good! it‚Äôs full of romance, comedy, drama, and a little bit of action too. i love srk so much, and he really outdid himself in this movie by being able to switch between simple suri to bold raj. anushka‚Äôs acting was excellent too considering it was her debut film. this movie really made me feel warm inside because the love story is so simple. nowadays, bollywood romance movies are full of partying and sex, but this movie depicts love in a pure way. i highly recommend this movie!","label":0},{"review":"the sweet innocence of this film made me keep smiling throughout.... the message that there's no greater thing than love and we fall in love with the person in whom, we see god.. is really heart touching.... as said u laugh, u cry, u
