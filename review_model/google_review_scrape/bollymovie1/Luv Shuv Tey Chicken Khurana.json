[{"review":"at first i found this film slightly odd . the second time , this little gem of a film , grew on me as a wonderfully eccentric , subtle comedy with well written characters .\n\nomi khurana ( the very handsome kunal kapoor ) returns from london in debt after going missing for a decade from his loving paternal grandfather's ( daar ji - vinod nagpal ) ancestral home in punjab .\n\nhis return delights his paternal aunt lata ( seema kaushal ) & his cousin jeet , but is viewed correctly with quiet suspicion by his father's younger brother , his perceptive & dignified uncle hemraj ( rajendra sethi ) .\n\nanother person perturbed with omi's return is his childhood sweetheart , harman ( huma qureshi ) who is a local physician now - but at heart , is still the unpolished , delinquent school girl who's cut out of the same cloth as the shady omi .\n\nwhile omi is blase about how he left harman , she is secretly still in love with him - an affection she is wary of & tries to curb at first , with her assessment of omi's true character & the bad influence he wielded on her in their school days . \n\nwhile omi lies about being an affluent ferrari-driving lawyer who lives near the buckingham palace , with the mittals as neighbours ( a lie readily accepted by his aunt lata , jeet & lata's eccentric brother,titu - but not his uncle hemraj ) he conceals from his family that he's really there to rob them again to erase his debt to london gangster , shanty .\n\nharman's dirty-dancing brother lovely, who runs a store selling undergarments & is trying to become a real estate agent, brings omi an offer of inr one crore from unintentionally funny , dhaba owning rival , kehar singh ( vipin sharma ) for daar ji's famous dhaba & the recipe for daar ji's secret 'chicken khurana'.\n\nomi is stumped since the recipe is known only to daar ji , who is now , old , adorable & recognizes no one but a crow - whom daar ji believes , is the love of his life, his beautiful , dead wife muskaan ( omi's grandmother ) & keeps singing to the scruffy black crow besides absent-mindedly & hilariously , responding in 'dhaba style' to people , \"tandoori or makhani ?\" etc . \n\napart from the delightful kehar singh ( whose idea of insulting lovely & his merchandise , was to call him a \" kabootar \" & that \" 6 din mein ched ho jaatein hain tere underwear mein \" ) other memorable characters are daar ji's cousin,'bua ji' , a pot-smoking god woman; dalidri, the loving man-servant who considers himself a family member ; \ntitu mamaji , the eccentric scooter-riding uncle who sleeps on the terrace , carries a radio , wears an undershirt everywhere , complains about his sister lata's bad cooking & is suspicious of jeet's sexual orientation ; \n\nmanty , shanty's gun-wielding enforcer who follows omi to punjab & gets hilariously gets homesick for his 'pind' & his 'bebe'.\n\nthis is a delightful film which stands up well to repeated viewings & has some ribald songs & a lovely background score .\n\ngood direction & editing . \nwell written script.","label":0},{"review":"this is one of the most simple and subtle movies ever made in bollywood. the storyline is so simple and so would say odd but its the series of events in between, the script and the performances that will make you love this one. two characters that i found the most interesting were of titu mama(absolutely hilarious) and dalidri(the servant). leave these two almost all of the character are really well played.\nabsolutely worth a watch.","label":0},{"review":"the secret love of family is shown in this flim along with panjabi tarka, bit slow few of the time but you may adjust with that. cast is good and apart from few of them. kunal kapoor did a fair job in this flim, few of the time he did over, overall it's a good flim to watch.","label":0},{"review":"unique story. nicely presented by director sameer sharma. all actors have done terrific job. i liked the characters of nikamma mama played by rajesh sharma & daarji played by veteran actor vinod nagpal.","label":0},{"review":"deep down in our heart we know that all the success which we had was due to some less important ingredient, which we incidentally grabbed. this movie revolves around that zeal of finding that secret ingredient for success üòä","label":0},{"review":"this movie grows on you!
