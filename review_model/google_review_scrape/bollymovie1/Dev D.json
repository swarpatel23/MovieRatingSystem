[{"review":"when it was released i never bothered to watch this film except listening to the songs only. the songs of the this movies watching it's for the time, i did get what is the movie is about. now reading about this movie and re-watching it twice, i really loved it. what anurag has done with this movie is really excellent work. how he shot every frame with appropriate details, location, lighting. representing the real nature of the story and characters.\n\ndev, character represents a generation of boys. it was great to see them with not much technology nor any depression. going to std and call. if you have habits you be bold and do it or else no habits. respected elders. no gimmick in relationship with friends or girlfriends. when they were angry they used to break things, like throwing the glasses or tea cups and punch in the mirror or window shield. it was lovely i miss 80's feel.","label":0},{"review":"epic story telling. generations changed and so does characters. high performance and unique presentation. ak's movies are watersheds in bollywood. b it black friday, devd or gowp. each scene is iconic. with realistic and engazing dialogues, brilliant directionon and fantastic acting each film brings more new dynamics to how stories should be presented in a motion picture. indian cinema ows a lot to such experimental cine creators who are setting new milestones with each such movies.","label":0},{"review":"a very refreshing movie from the usual bollywood flicks, underrated in many aspects. abhay deol acting is superb and underrated, kalki's debut is too good!
