[{"review":"this movie is best movie ever made in bollywood and indeed best movie of emraan, what an actor he is. this movie was made way ahead of its time.\noutstanding story, outstanding direction and outstanding acting by everyone and not to forget the music and background score.\neach and every scene of the movie is a class, every scene has story  telling in itself.\nemran did a great job, not much words spoken but all he showcased his pain his sorrow his loneliness all by his eyes. the actresses and ashutosh rana also did fab job.\nhow  this movie knitted sprtiuality and humanity  is just awesome. this movie will make you believe in god even if you are an atheist.\ni must say i have watched this so many times but every time this movie amazes me, such heart touching movie which will touch your soul.\neverything is perfect , this movie is a class. masterpiece indeed. emraan you are my favourite.","label":0},{"review":"this movie is a masterpiece. the comments you are reading are the words straight from the heart.\ni would state this movie as 'the most beautiful bollywood movie ever'. every character has justified their role. songs are marvellous, i still love (rather say 'feel') these songs after 11 years. script and plot are amazing. no one could have done the roles better than emraan hashmi, shad randhawa, shriya saran and ashutosh rana (actually every actor of the movie).\nthis is the movie which will remain in my heart till the last breath. if there comes a sequel of this movie, i would book 1st day-1st show in advance instantly whatever the price is.\nlast but not the least, if i can define the beauty and sensation of this movie through my words then i'm actually lacking in it ❤️","label":0},{"review":"one of my all time favorites and the best movie of emraan hashmi. deeply emotional and spiritual at the same time. beautiful songs that will stand the test of time, especially tera mera rishta purana. \nthis movie is unlike any other love story. it could have been just that but it's not. it's deeply spiritual. mere words cannot describe this film. you have to watch it and feel it for yourself. \nalmost 12 years later, awarapan remains a blessed movie. 💟🙏","label":0},{"review":"this is the best bollywood action/romantic movie. even after 12 years, i will still say , the best ever made. it was way ahead of its time. the songs, story, acting of each and every character is the best and just cant expect more when it was filmed. still touches each corner of your heart, doesnt count you are emotional or not, it will get you. words will get short, just watch it guys who havent yet. and im really in shock why imran hasmi is not acting these days with these sort of movies. missing him greatly.","label":0},{"review":"one of the most intense and deep films , ever . it shows the horrors of human trafficking , communal differences and the lives that are destroyed due to these issues. the music is out of the world and reflects each mood. emraan's acting was so real and touching . ashutosh, shriya and the others were brilliant as well. that film can be watched everyday and it still shakes  something inside you.","label":0},{"review":"first time i watched this in year 2009.believe me i have watched this movie 100 times since then. emraan hashmi's acting in this movie,  is best till the date. a sad movie which gathered loneliness around. it's songs are still far better than modern songs. a hitman gave his life to protect love birds.thanks 🙏🙇 bhatt camp for making this marvelous movie","label":0},{"review":"this movie❤\nthere can be no review to express this movies greatness..love you emraan and please we are waiting for the sequel..the only movie which possesses the power to
