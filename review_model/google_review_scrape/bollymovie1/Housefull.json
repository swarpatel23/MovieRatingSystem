[{"review":"not that i thought housefull 4 to be a serious film on india-china relationship, but never expected it to be this absurd either. well, as housefull franchise’s brand ambassador aakhri pasta (chunkey pandey) says, ‘i am joking.’ this is exactly what the trailer promised it to be.\n\nright in the beginning, while punching a co-actor, max (bobby deol) thunders, “aaj mera fast hai isiliye thoda slow maara (i punched you slow because i am fasting today),” and the audience immediately recognises the setting. it’s the same one in which covert lovers make out in front of the girl’s sleepwalking father, or the one where a python grabs someone’s balls. the point is that housefull films were never meant to be intelligent. these are literally slap and stick comedies, if you dare say.\n\nthe story is about three london-based brothers—harry (akshay kumar), max (bobby deol) and roy (riteish deshmukh). they want to marry three daughters—kriti (kriti sanon), neha (kirti kharbanda) and pooja (pooja hegde)—of a rich businessman, played by ranjit, who keeps switching to ‘beti’ from ‘beauty.’ i wonder why they didn’t use kriti kharbanda’s real name!\n\nharry, who gets flashes from his past life 600 years ago, believes his brothers and everyone around them, were part of a bizarre story that took place in 1419. the credit must be given to kumar who is wholeheartedly into this ridiculous set-up, and wants us to believe him. some of us did as i heard whistles around. however, it wasn’t actually wonderful to see deol reminiscing in the tune of ‘soldier, soldier,’ and deshmukh playing an effeminate character. you know how they introduce him: isne gender ka tender nahi bhara. i don’t know how to translate that accurately.\n\n\nlet me break it down for you: it’s one of those films where the actor would ask the actress, “bees ke baad kya aata hai (what comes after 20),” before kissing her.\n\nor, somebody would come and tell the camera, “london me do hi cheez famous hain, big ben and big bhai, (there are only two things famous in london, big ben and big brother).”\n\nbig ben and big bhai! ben-bhai! you get the drift!\n\n\nsomebody says ‘don’t be horsing around’ and the next shot is of horses. if you still don’t find it intriguing enough then the director farhad samji will present you the royal family of britain, dancing to thoughtfully penned song ‘chumma.’\n\nas if this was not enough. a character faking pregnancy says, “main abla hoon tabla nahin,” and somebody immediately retorts, “ye katappa toh ek hi cut me pappa ban gaya.”\n\nprobably this much criticism is not justified. when did the makers pretend otherwise? but the well of jokes dries after a while and the same gags keep repeating. had there not been akhay kumar, it would have become a really painful watch. he has barely managed to stop housefull 4 from becoming another tees maar khan.\n\n\nit’s funny in parts but can’t hold attention for fifteen minutes straight at any juncture. there lies the problem. kumar’s excellent comic timing isn’t enough to cover up other characters’ lack of substance.\n\ndespite all this, two brilliantly placed things in script cracked me up. the first is three pigeons named neil, nitin and mukesh, and the second is this dialogue: “agar main badshah hoon toh tu kya honey singh hai (if i am badshah then who are you? honey singh?).”\n\noh, i laughed so hard.\n\nno, i am joking.\n\nrating: 1.5/5","label":0},{"review":"amazing movie #mast hai. must watch for every one(go and watch).\n this movie is a perfect mixture of

start to roll.\ndon’t trust the verdict of firangi mindset critics or moviegoers. they will accept and enjoy racheal having multiple love affairs in american tv show friends but when an actor like akshay kumar makes them laugh that literally looks funny then they blindly call it “aaaathooo”. \nto those criticising the film i would ask “if you didn’t like housefull 4 only for the lack of logic then why did you like avengers infinity war where a normal human tony stark goes and easily fights on some distant planet with a alien who coincidentally also speaks english”. it’s a typical mindset of these double standard people that if something is said in english or if something is done as the americans and the europeans do then it is classy, outstanding and mind blowing but if the same thing is said in hindi or done as we indians then it’s cheap, third class and pathetic. \nas indians it’s important for us to support our films regardless of whether it’s from which part of india otherwise the day is not far when we would have nothing but only hollywood films to watch in theatres and on tv. i am not saying that americans films should be removed from our theatres but it’s also important that our indian films don’t lose their market just because of this typical firangi mindset of some indians who by mistake were left in india after 1947.\nlastly not every mainstream actor has the guts to do comedy so perfectly as akshay kumar has done for the past 19-20 years. most of the mainstream actors are either doing biopics or doing some other serious stuff but there are hardly few actors who are good at comedy and want this genre to thrive. it’s akshay kumar whose films like phir hera pheri, heyy babyy, bhool bhulaiyaa, welcome are still made into memes and not the films of srk, salman or aamir.","label":0},{"review":"#housefull4  - comedy of errors and terrors 🤪\n\nforemost was the comedy on our part - we booked a show for sunday 10:50. reached the mall only to realise the

time pairings are mixed up. can what was done in 1419 be undone in 2019?\n\nin its fourth edition the housefull franchise ensures that it takes its brand of over the top and mindless humour forward. actually, it's more like the reverse, since it rewinds back six hundred years to the 15th century.\n\nbut first, it's london of 2019, where harry (akshay kumar) is a hairdresser who alternately has bouts of memory loss and flashes from his past life. max (bobby deol) and roy (riteish deshmukh) are his brothers. together they hatch a plan to marry kriti, neha and pooja (kriti sanon, kriti kharbanda and pooja hegde respectively), the three daughters of a billionaire, thakral (ranjeet), to be able to pay off the loot money of a mafia don michael that they have misplaced. when the marriage destination is inadvertently fixed as sitamgarh in india, the couples head there and harry meets his past life friend aakhri pasta (chunky pandey) and recalls everything from that time. the three pairs of lovers - rajkumar bala dev singh (akshay kumar) and princess madhu (kriti sanon), bangdu maharaj (riteish deshmukh) and princess mala (pooja hegde), angrakshak dharamputra (bobby deol, yes the pun is not lost here) and princess meena (kriti kharbanda) are killed, leaving their love stories unfinished when they get caught up in an evil design to eliminate them. although, bala himself is 'shaitaan ka sala' and has laid a trap to marry mala, so that he can become the king of sitamgarh.\n\nthe main hitch now is that, in 2019 the couples are mixed up, and bala (akshay kumar) decides that the pairings must be set right so none of them end up with their sister or brother-in-law from their past life.\n\nso with this central plot point in hand, housefull4 takes off. of course, this mission to set things 'right' leads to confusions galore and a deluge of characters, who spring in and out of the narrative and from their last life to present life. there is a sprinkling of mindless comic moments owing to the general silliness all around. and a dollop of low- brow, crass humor. a special low point is when princess meena pretends to be molested to convince dharamputra to marry her. add to that, there are portions that drag and jokes that feel dated.\n\nthe film's increasingly loud background score (especially in the second half) and the cgi in the period setting leave a lot to be desired. and a running joke on three pigeons named neil, nitin and mukesh that doesn't actually fly.\n\nof the actresses, it is kriti sanon who has the most lengthy role and she pulls it off well. kriti kharbanda and pooja hegde are reduced to being props, owing to their limited screen time. interestingly, all three are uniformly dressed in the same colors, as if it were a deliberate attempt to not be able to tell them apart. riteish deshmukh gets the quirks of his characters well and does manage to pull in some laughs. manoj pahwa, nawazuddin siddiqui, rana daggubatti and johnny lever have their oddball parts to play in the film - though some seem just pointless. and yes, archana puran singh pops up often in a photo.\n\nbut largely, it is akshay kumar who has the most fleshed out role and shoulders most of the film. and he definitely shines in most of them getting the comic timing right.\n\nneedless to add, don't go looking for logic in housefull4 (but still, how did the blood on rana daggubatti's blue jacket magically disappear in the last scene?). in the last 30 minutes, kriti repeatedly asks, \"yeh sab kya ho raha hain?\" a sentiment that could be echoed by the viewers.\n\noverall, housefull4 ends up as a complete mad caper. which, if you're a fan of the housefull brand of comedy, might appeal to you. but if you are not, then proceed with caution.\n\nthe final verdict: not so full of comedy.","label":0},{"review":"absolutely disappointed and disgruntled with housefull 4. don't know from where to start ,its almost like i wasted my money and need a refund.what was going through akshay's mind when he signed this movie.huge star cast ,big sets and locations,budget doesn't compensate for weak story and screenplay.worst of all they made a spoof of one of the greatest indian movies-bahubali the conclusion when akshay kumar aka rajkumar bala gets exiled from his kingdom and they tried to make the comic version of the jaykara song .very cheap and pathetic. atleast don't insult the film if you can't respect it and have capibility of making an epic like the one ss rajamouli made.comedy is repetetive and jokes are blown out of proportion.housefull veterans akshay and riteish deshmukh fail to save this film as they try hard to make you laugh but fail nonetheless.bala track is overly long and repetitive and bangru maharaj 's character which riteish plays is overstretched and exaggeration of similar dialogues.bobby(body) deol acts a stuntman in the entire movie only present to flex his muscles and he is at the recieving of butt of jokes based on his previous movies like soldier.the girls kriti sanon, pooja hedge and kriti kharbanda waste their talent thoroughly and are only there to add the glamour quotient and spice up the songs.the much needed relief comes from scenes featuring veterans ranjit and ace comedian johnny lever .rana daggubati who played the wicked baddie bhallaldeva is an embarrassment only to fight and shout for the all the scenes featuring him.another talent gone waste.it seems these days that every movie franchises like golmaal ,dhamaal and housefull are going on a landslide and unless they come up with some content ,producers and directors shouldn't make garbage movies just for increasing their already huge bank balance.get nostalgic remembering the golden days of comedy movies like bhool bhulaiya,bhagam bhag, golmaal 1,dhammal 1,hera pheri,chup chup ke, welcome and the list goes on .it is almost like we won't get to get classics like these again as they are hiring overrated actors like kartik aryan in the bhool bhulaiya sequel.akshay should have done it.he only can pull off something like that. it will be a flop.it is like a bygone era.yes you don't need to put any logic and sense in movies like these but this is way beyond another level of stupidity and irrelevant comedy.my ratings 2/5 .i recommend you should instead watch old movies at  television instead of watching this one unless you really love the housefull series","label":0},{"review":"the laughter club just came to your nearest theater, akshay, riteish and bobby are at it again. as if the previous

though..soldier, barsaat etc!\n\notherwise, this film by sajid saamji is funny in parts. the cameo appearance by nawazuddin siddiqui is really helping. the songs (especially \"ek chumma\") are actually entertaining more than the film itself!\n\nsince there's no depth in the storyline, you can only expect a little from the actors. akshay, as usual, is funny and on the dot with his comic timing. riteish is good too. while chunky pandey (hilarious) and johnny lever do their part well, the three girls look gorgeous (special mention about pooja hegde) and dance well!\n\nto conclude, i'd

blast.\n\n\nthe film revolves around a bunch of people from 1419 and their reincarnations in 2019. and as the trailer tells you, the three main couples have been mismatched in their reincarnations. \"iski biwi iski biwi nahi hai, woh teri biwi hai!\" (transl. \"his wife isn't his wife, she's your wife!\").\n\nif you ask me, the mismatched pairings is maybe the least interesting thing in the movie. the most entertaining thing in this movie is akshay kumar. he is on screen for maybe 90 percent of the time, and that's a good thing. whether his 1419 bala is hilariously scheming for the throne or his 2019 harry is forgetting everything that just happened, i enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nritiesh did his parts as good as it can get, but he didn't have many parts. i wish we got more of him, like the previous instalments. housefull is an akshay-riteish franchise and it feels like riteish missed out a bit here. speaking of missed-out regulars, boman irani's batuk patel was also dearly missed.\n\nbut akshay compensates for almost everything. he does the usual tough bits such as comic timing and dialogue delivery with ease (expected from him at this point), but where he absolutely shines are his facial expressions throughout the movie. whether it is his signature \"i don't know\", bala's \"phish-phish\" or (my personal favourite) \"bhoola bhoola bhoola bhoola re\", he rocks it.\n\nother than akshay, the movie relies on funny character and one-liners. the one-liners work most of the time, but some of them are terribly bad, even by my standards. it also relies on confusion caused by reincarnation and, at times, mocks itself for being a \"reincarnation comedy\".\n\nas for the rest of the cast: johnny lever unbelievably fails in the first half, but then strikes back towards the end. kriti s, pooja and kriti b do well in the limited roles they have. i wish the leading ladies got better parts instead, like in housefull 1 (and to some extent, hf2). bobby deol tries hard to not be a misfit, but it just doesn't work. ranjeet does well. chunky pandey does well yet again as aakhri pasta. rana daggubati is a surprises with his comedy and he does extremely well. so does the dependable sharad kelkar. nawazuddin enjoys his cameo and makes sure that you do too.\n\nfor reasons i can't understand, this movie has received polarising reviews from the audience and

your heart out at certain moments during the film but nothing you'll recommend to someone on monday. housefull 4 qualifies for the latter. one great thing about the movie is that it's not a vulgar comedy filled with hindi slangs (which many other directors bank on today to make people laugh). it's old school, clean and meant for a family watch & i really loved it from that stand point. akshay

riteish deshmukh behave in a feminine way. there's no originality left in that any longer. the music is terrible & the story is rubbish. however, the best part of the movie are the last 20 mins. so

rajamouli as he has copied 2 films in one and tried to make it funny. but they fell flat on their faces especially sajid khan who originally wrote the script and idea. \n\nseems like after bahubali went hit these guys decided to make anything rubbish and feed the people that looks like bahubali. \n\nthe colour coordination and cgi is good but since originality was missing this movie did jot do well. \n\nlooking at the amount of films akshay kumar does its like movies are just money making and numbers for him. he needs to give time to the script rather than just saying yes to anything.

discussed ahead. be-warned***********\n\nthe housefull franchise is not needed in this world, but since its out in the universe, lets review it accordingly. before i analyze the movie, lets discuss its parameters first. for a housefull movie, i can not review in the same essence of what i will review a fan, badhaai ho or even bajrangi bhaijaan.\n\nfor a housefull movie, i have to limit my parameter to a shelf that 'houses\" the race franchise, the aneez bazmee or a farah khan movie.\n\nis the movie gnostistic, homophobic, sexist, misogynistic and derogatory? yes it is in every sense. kirti sanson goes to punch sharad kelkar in one scene, and akshay pulls her aside and mutters \"yeh tumhara kaam nahi hai\". johnny lever is given the drag makeup and made to believe he is a reincarnation of his daughter. ritiesh deshmukh gives a character sketch and a painful potrayal of a \"nartaki\".\n\nthere are many why's in the movie: why did nawazuddin siddiqui agree to do this horrible role? why does the kabootar's have a better role than bobby deol? why didn't the writer's write a joke in the script?\n\neven askhay kumar decided he gave up on this movie, and for some apparent reason he was in his jogging outfit instead of his wedding sherwani in the climax sequence?\n\nsee what i think is that just because we have grown watching such senseless comedies (or bollywood's interpretation of 'comedy'), that its so inbred and ingrained in our brains, that we are compelled to laugh while watching the movie. this is because our brain tells us this is bollywood version of what it thinks is funny, and thats why i should laugh here. this is why i don't blame the average movie goer not understanding my reviews. its like explaining section 377 to ritiesh deshmukh's character in this movie.\n\nthis movie was a stretch - i was already complaining by the interval. the songs are... interesting. nothing that pops up. there's is nothing to write about the performances. its there. as for akshay kumar, he did mission mangal, kesari, padman, and then he decided to do housefull 4. choices.\n\nsee i'm not stopping you not to see this movie. see it at your own will. but then do switch off your brain, and don't try to look for sense while watching it. you know the standard of bollywood franchise's - don't go in the cinema expecting to watch \"the gods must be crazy\" or \"andaaz apna apna\" - it is what it is.\n\nthis is just another movie you'll forget about in 2 weeks, toh kyun itna dimaag lagane ka? did you remember welcome back, mubarrakah, or singh is bling? nahi na - toh chill kar!\n\nbut i do want you to ask yourself did you laugh at the homophobic, sexist and antagonistic 'jokes' or did you cringe?\n\nratings: 2 rupees ka pehla director

sara bodinar (story and screenplay), tasha bhambra, sparsh khetarpal and sajid khan (he's been credited for screenplay despite everything) have that in abundance. in keeping with the theme of the first three installments - housefull 1, 2 and 3, akshay kumar, riteish deshmukh, bobby deol, kriti sanon, kriti kharbanda and pooja hegde-starrer is just that. a hundred and forty-five minutes of non-sense.\n\nwe meet the boys in their present-day avatar in 2019. akshay (harry) is in love with kriti kharbanda (neha), riteish (roy) is in love with pooja hegde (pooja) and bobby (max) is in love with kriti sanon (kriti). that these women are filthy rich, and marrying them would help the men pay off a hefty debt they owe sharad kelkar (michael bhai) is a mere coincidence. they meet their

in tezzaab, 1988, and both are still there after 31 years - indeed an inning well played. and still rocking....\n\nwell, for those who have been constantly giving negative reviews for this movie, continuously making that noise on social media with their negative reviews.... \n\n01\nremember what ms balan said in 'dirty picture'? a movie, is only for entertainment. people watch movies, for

only thing that matters.\n\n02\ncomedy, laugh, are of two types. loud and fine. this is loud comedy. one has to understand that. you cannot expect wit in such genre. making people laugh, for two+

criticizing this movie, please watch more movies...explore.\n\n03\nwatch hudson hawk, 1991. it was a similar movie.

back, actors are made to look like prince charles, prince harry and william, and kate and meghan, and they are all dancing along. furthermore, akshay kisses a queen elizabeth lookalike. how distasteful. \n\nfirstly, the movie reinforces stereotypical gender roles. such movies are one of the causes for sexism in india. while the 3 men were holding their swords bravely, the women are seen playing with bangles. the men in the movie attempt to please the women by placing her in danger and then 'saving her.' while kriti measures bobby's biceps, he measures her waist and says 'wow what a waist one inch thinner,\" thus reinforcing beauty standards, leading to body image issues. ridiculous. while akshay kumar does fantastic movies, i cannot believe he agreed to doing such a shameful movie. \n\nother than these core issues, the movie is absolutely pathetic. the plot is horrible, and the lines are also. johnny lever wearing a sari, and ritesh acting 'feminine' is just not funny.

skeptic about watching it but it turned out to be a nice and time pass movie and thats what is the primary reason for watching movie passing time with your loved ones or family. isn't it.. go for it and its definitely not as bad as its made out to be.","label":0},{"review":"i don't know why people are hating it. the movie is quite awesome. i would recommend you guys to watch it. like akshay kumar's acting as bala was outstanding. reincarnation comedy is a new thing touched by bollywood. we should appreciate it. the movie should get 6 or 7 stars at least. it has the humour that we require. it's full of humour from the beginning till the end. perfect movie for me. housefull franchise has always been close to my heart","label":0},{"review":"an average movie.\nbut it will make you laugh and that's what is expected out of it.\ni don't think people have to search logic in such movies. they are made just to give you a good laugh and it is doing it's work to some extent.\nakshay kumar as always had given his best and will make you laugh as bala and harry. \nnothing else was there to watch on diwali  and many theatres are having too many shows. \nnot waste of money at least and not must watch also. go for it if you are bored and want to have a laugh.","label":0},{"review":"udience reviews\n\n    \nnot that i thought housefull 4 to be a serious film on india‑china relationship, but never expected it to be this ...\n\namazing movie #mast hai. must watch for every one(go and watch). this movie is a perfect mixture of *comedy+...\n\nit’s a full on entertainer for diwali. it will make you laugh and keep you entertained from start till the credits start to roll. ...\n\nmitwa kumar\nposting publicly.","label":0},{"review":"i loved this movie !!! it’s nonsensical and so much fun ... the entire hall was laughing through our. be it akshay kumar’s eyes doing a keshto mukherjee or deshmukhs hilarious gender confused verbal output ,to everyone’s reincarnation or gama marega 😂 and the use of alia bhatt , mahesh bhatt . all the stars were great and i think 100percent fun . just don’t go looking for logic and you will love it.","label":0},{"review":"well for starters. i did not enjoy this one as much as i did the earlier films in the housefull series.\nto me it felt as if not enough humor and the existing jokes were the same typical ones that are repeated again and again. maybe i had my anticipations too high after hfull 1,2 & 3, which all seemed genuinely original and full of fun especially the 3 installment. akshay like always is the one who delivers the best and unforgettable laughs. i would give this movie a mediocre rating of 2.5/5.","label":0},{"review":"well, if u have watched 1st three installments of housefull, u must know that u need to rest ur brain and never try to find logic in housefull franchise movies. this part has little humour. the movie is watchable only because of akshay sir's comic timing and few punches from the great comedian johny lever sir. the climax is very similiar to part 2 where jagga daaku was chasing the gang.\nin the end, if u just want to kill time and enjoy some slapstick comedy, go watch housefull 4. otherwise, u should skip. my rating 3/5 (1 extra for akshay sir).","label":0},{"review":"it was a superb film. look, logic and comedy both are hard to be found together. if you like logical films, then this is definitely not for you. but if you can keep away logic, you will definitely enjoy this movie a lot. it was very hilarious\ncompared to other movies of housefull series, it was slightly below expectation, but it has a lots and lots of bundles of comedy.\nits a must watch film.\n#must watch.","label":0},{"review":"this is an amazing movie. each scene is packed with powerful punches that will surely make you laugh. there some lines that make you go \"ehh...\" but the rest of the movie covers them up. the story is unique and interesting, the acting is nice and especially the ending, was satisfactory. the movie ties itself together seemlessly and is a must-watch. \nin short, go watch it. you won't regret spending your money.","label":0},{"review":"keep ur mind aside and watch this entertaining reincarnation comedy. i have not seen anyone leaving his seat. post interval quite entertaining. critics seems to be harsh. if u want comedy then it shud be senseless yet entertaining. akshay kumar is king of such comedy. johnny lever proves that old is gold. cinematography is superb.\"bala\" song is good and the qawaali by rana dagubatti is a surprise.  a cameo by nawazuddin siddiqui adds extra smile.","label":0},{"review":"i don't understand for what reason people are not finding the movie funny. the theatre i was in everyone was on their seats laughing. there is a scene where there was a literal thunder of laughter in the entire theatre. the people finding logic, c'mon dude its a comedy movie what do you expect interstellar?\nif you wanna have fun, lighten up your mood and have cramps while laughing (if you understand humor) then it's a must go.","label":0},{"review":"i liked the the whole housefull franchise.. and recently the 4th chapter of it..  the housefull 4..\n   it's so comedy movie.. it made me laugh  a lot.. i love all the akshay kumar films..  bcauz his all the movies are fantastic and amazing... \n  this is family movie.. every one can watch it..  but only leaving 2-3 all the remaining movie much better by the all movies that pretents us to laugh.. \n   this movie cast akshay kumar, ritesh deshmukh, bobby deol, kriti sanon, kriti kharbanda, and pooja hedge as in the lead rolls...","label":0},{"review":"house full 4 is a must watch family entertainer which will add joy to your diwali mood. there is hardly any dull moment in the film which is full of laughter. \ngreat perferormence by akshay kumar again. rest of the cast did their best in keep you entertained till the end.\nplease don't go by the negative comments by the critics and all go and enjoy the movie with your family.","label":0},{"review":"housefull 4 2019 new bollywood comedy movie, a revenge story that forces all the characters to take birth again after 600 years.\n\nakshay kumar(bala), ritesh deshmukh, bobby deol,  kirti sanoon, kiriti kharbanda, pooja hegde and all the associated characters \n\nhave reborn in the film.\n\nthis video is a detailed review of the film. movie starts with historic places and continues till the interval. akshay kumar who is london ghajni in charector plays his part very well.\n\nthe climax is good, but the film fails to impress as previous housefull films did. you would love to see the film in second half where all the roles are in present and plays well\n\n3/5 stars to the movie","label":0},{"review":"this movie was very much illogical. too many elements were being added which made the scenes very boring and idiotic. but there are also certain bits in this film which are hilarious. if a person who watches a lot of hollywood movies and if they go and watch this film they will get to know that a lot of scenes or plots were inspired or copied from certain iconic hollywood movies. i think till now none of the houseful releases could beat the first houseful movie where lara dutta and deepika padukone were the main actresses. rating- 3/5.","label":0},{"review":"1/5\nit is said that the morning shows the day. likewise, from the trailer we can often judge a movie. \n\ni had expected a crass movie full of stupid jokes and i watched one. its hard to believe that someone other than sajid khan can direct such a bad movie. \n\nit's not that everything is bad. mr akshay kumar tried his best to uplift the movie. the other actors were also not bad. but the script and direction were so very bad that the movie turned out to be a disaster. i really feel sad for johnny lever and nawazuddin siddiqui for abusing their talents. \n\nthis movie is for kapil sharma fans. others might watch it at their own risk. i personally watched the movie in a theater to watch the reaction of other audiences and trust me, i was not disappointed.\n\np.s. for all the reviewers marking this as a family movie, i do not know what kind of family equations they have. i personally can never even tell my parents that i have watched such a classless and sexist movie.","label":0},{"review":"movie reviews are always personal opinion. so, anyone getting influenced by these opinion you're loosing your chance.\noverall this movie is amazing and perfect diwali gift for all the people who loves entertainment and fun.\nperfect package to watch with your family and kids.\nand yes happy diwali everyone have a housefull diwali. \nignore the negative reviews. \ngo ahead you'll have blast in this movie. ❤","label":0},{"review":"guys don't go on critics review they only want to spread negativity on the film which is story less.. as we know the housefull series made for the purpose of laugh and entertainment .. there is no story bt lots of happiness is there...and h4 gives us same feeling. akshay kumar is on fire as bala or harry....every single scene u will laugh ..others done awsm work..so go n live it...4*/5...must watch","label":0},{"review":"writing off a film is easy. but if you can appreciate the effort that has gone to design the sets, costumes and getting the look right not forgetting the research that must have gone behind it ...you 'll realise the grand scale of this film. a stellar star cast and ace comedians in place makes you glued to the seat. the franchise holds lots of promise ahead too this film ensures.","label":0},{"review":"i don’t normally write these movie reviews but for this movie i just had to. i have watched housefull 1, 2 and 3 and they were all amazing but this movie just sucked👎 i had walked in with expectations of it being at least a funny movie but it was just filled up with cheesy jokes and the same rhyming sequence that annoyed a string in my head. i thought the movie would eventually get good but it did not... bobby deol in the housefull series is just not a good fit. many people have liked this movie, which i fail to see why? if you are easily satisfied by cringey jokes then this is for you. i just watched a random episode of friends and believe you me it was way better than the entire movie!\nwaste of time","label":0},{"review":"its a brilliant entertainer. the critics have no sense of humor for the illogical but hilarious masterpiece. yeah its not logical, but its comedy and not maths. you want logic go solve some equations. it has everyone rolling around their seats through and through. every scene thrills and fills you with cachinnating laughter.","label":0},{"review":"a good one entertainer,,one time watchable could have been more better but still its an amazing movie...many funny scenes,,will surely make u laugh talking about cast akshay kumar as always supperb ritesh deshmukh too stole the show,bobby average girls all 3 did perfect chunky pandey also supperb.... background music n songs too were amazing,,overall a good movie go for it\nmy rating:-
