[{"review":"this is one movie that is sheer perfection because it is exactly what it is supposed to be - over the top, dramatic, and a light hearted spoofy take on old world bollywood with heartwarming characters and superb acting. everything about this movie is spot on. fantastic music, dialogues, and superb hamming by all actors. hard to believe that this is deepika padukone's first movie as she more than holds her own against the inimitable srk, who is at his absolute finest whether he's being silly, sensitive, or insanely dramatic.\ni love watching this one when i really want to remind myself that life doesn't have to be serious all the time, and that if things aren't okay as yet, it means 'picture abhi baaki hai mere dost'.","label":0},{"review":"this is best commercial
