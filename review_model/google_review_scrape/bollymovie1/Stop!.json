[{"review":"non-stop is a captivating action thriller that keeps you glued to the edge of your seats. no subplots, no slow parts, no unwanted stuff: just the main plot full of action and suspense. what else do you need? the film is in itself one big set piece with a sharp editing and brilliantly crafted tension. liam neeson is really amazing and delivers with sincerity, be it the action or the talkie parts. despite of being set in a plane, the film's plot will not let you even think about lack of exotic locations. fight scenes are outstanding and every action block brings a new turn to the story. in short, non-stop is an intense, thrill-a-minute action ride that won't let go of the grip it has on you till the end. go ahead, watch it!\n\n10/10.","label":0},{"review":"because of liam neeson's screen presence, this movie elevates. though there are some pot holes in the screen play for example; the way co pilot is  killed is not very convincing . however, the narration is fast paced and other characters add flair to neeson's dilemma in the story. background score is worth mentioning. and of course, there is a typical neeson film hand to hand combat sequence which is very well filmed. but jaume collet-serra has given a very good film with liam neesan \" run all night \" and it unfortunately was underrated and didn't earn the laurels it deserved.","label":0},{"review":"absolutely love this movie! this is exactly what i want to watch. great thriller... i bet you can't predict the next moment in this movie! if you miss even a single moment, you gotta confused. enjoying every bit of the movie!
