[{"review":"the first half of the movie shows the love of salman khan and rani mukharjee. we are taken into a climacitic height and are allowed to have a steep fall when salman dies and rani becomes despearte for her love. it becomes pure oxymoron to say that the family becomes lonely then after. we experience amitabh as a father who tries to refill his daughter like daughter-in-law's life with happiness. the title baabul best suits the film as the movie goes round the fatherly figure amitabh bachan. here we can live the love of parents for their children even after their tragic death.","label":0},{"review":"emotional movie...big b and rani acted so emotionally...\nreally ds movie makes u cry....as u see the bond of love....between rani n salman...n hoe big b try to brng happiness in his daughter in law life after his son death...\nrani is a versatile actress ....don't how she act so emotionally....i love her acting ...amitabh is god of acting...no...doubt.","label":0},{"review":"very emotional movie after salman died. both salman and rani plays a very good role in this movie. the song keh raha hai was very good sung by sonu nigam. amitabh sir was plays very good. good movie overall.","label":0},{"review":"an amazing film showing the differences in soulmate love and friendship love (which can develop into true love over time). couldn't stop crying for almost five minutes after the second wedding.","label":0},{"review":"in this film i cry soo emotional because salman khan died scene and emotional song are there so this film is my favorite 😍😘 i love it so much","label":0},{"review":"awesome movie \nwhat a fantastic role done by amitabh bachan g","label":0},{"review":"it's a master piece one , need a very large heart .its just not that easy.","label":0},{"review":"awsm movie i love this movie 😘😘😘and vry emotional movie after salman khan died😔😔😔","label":0},{"review":"best movie i have ever seen","label":0},{"review":"it was a great mobie of its time","label":0},{"review":"supper . awesome. film","label":0},{"review":"huge tearjerker 😢.  loved every minute of it.","label":0},{"review":"nice movie, i cried literally at some scenes...","label":0},{"review":"awesome film","label":0},{"review":"a nice and real heart torching movie....","label":0},{"review":"nice  movie","label":0},{"review":"nice movie","label":0},{"review":"nice movie","label":0},{"review":"thinking of every 🇮🇳indian father -in -law will change after watching this movie","label":0},{"review":"mast move my jan bhaijan","label":0},{"review":"i am so sad that salman khan and he last breath and he died","label":0},{"review":"awsm one...","label":0},{"review":"grest movie","label":0}]
