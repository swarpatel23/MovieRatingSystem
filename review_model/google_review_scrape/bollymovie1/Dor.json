[{"review":"adapted from malayalam film, razzaq's,'perumazhakalam' ( monsoon season ), this beautifully shot movie is set with arid & beautiful rajasthan as the backdrop .\nzeenat (gul panag) , a self-reliant muslim lady , travels from himachal pradesh to rajasthan on a desperate mission to get meera ( ayesha takia ) a cloistered hindu haveli bahu, to sign a 'maafinaama' that will stay her husband's execution in the middle east .\n\nzeenat is so tranquil that her composure belies her precarious situation while newly-widowed meera flits around in the background of her in-laws' haveli like a fragile shadow .\n\napart from the major themes of forgiveness , friendship & other philosophies , the most riveting one was of the dark tentacles of exploitation creeping up around a financially dependant widow , illustrated by meera's father-in-law, raghubir ( girish karnad ) , a seemingly dignified , mustachioed patriarch ; who, inspite of all his external appearances turns out to be a weak , sleazy man who secretly agrees to barter the lovely meera to lascivious factory owner chopra ( nagesh kuknoor ) for financial recompense . \n\none of the most arresting scenes was of raghubir seizing meera by her elbow ; who inspite of her vulnerability & powerlessness , calmly orders raghubir to release her arm , since she'd granted only his son ( her dead husband ) the right to touch her & not raghubir .\n\napart from ayesha takia's fragile-as-dried-petals & yet incorruptible & hard-as-crystal portrayal of meera & gul panag's self - reliant yet vulnerable grace of zeenat ; other notable roles are \nrendered by uttara baokar ( dadima ) & shreyas talpade, a charming, petty thief who accompanies zeenat on her journey .\n\na poetic & moving film.","label":0},{"review":"dor- aptly justified by the content of the film. the story revolves around the core theme that one has to rise among all odds take the \"dor\" of one's life coz life can't go on like in utter despair forever. there would be hurdles to cross to ,to be bumped again & again doing what one pleases as zeenat says u have get ready to face the consequences of ur decision as the power to take decision comes with a conditions but at least u would be following ur heart.\nthe mesmerising backdrop of rajasthan has put class to the story line.\nthe melancholy satire on the way the society functions just as the society demands to be ,deciding everyone's life like a catapult throwing from one corner to another as it wishes. life is too short for such narrow concerns & following the heart can only lead to satiation of one's existence.\nthe last scene was truly touching when meera catches the train along with zeenat portrayed that living a life where u r not happy is worthless better to throw that away & begin afresh coz life dor  should be in ur own hands not expecting a \"farista\" to come & change everything.. that is i believe why god has provided a brain for...let the perception of society go to hell, at the end of the day what really matters is the happiness of one's own soul.","label":0},{"review":"this is the best movie. it potrays a lovely friendship between two ladies with great innocence. the traditional cultural atmosphere of rajasthan created in this movie alongside the parched lands of rajasthan is mesmerising. the lonely temple far away from the havelis somewhere between the sand dunes where the two friends mingles fills the viewer's heart with great joy and peace at the same time.","label":0},{"review":"this film is awesome. there is only one condition to watch, it
