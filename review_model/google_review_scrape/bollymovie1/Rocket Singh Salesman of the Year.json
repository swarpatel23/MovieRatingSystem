[{"review":"this is not an usual bollywood flick with songs, action and comedy. the movie revolves around a sikh graduate(portrayed authentically by ranbir kapoor) who aspires to be salesman. as he steps into the corporate world, he is shocked by the reality of sales business where unethical practices, cut-throat atmosphere, unrealistic targets, selling products with high markups are norms & customers are seen just as numbers. he doesn't wishes to abide by these norms drawing a lot of flak from seniors and colleagues and gets isolated by them.\n\nhe realizes that by being nice one can never survive in this competitive world. so he decides to crave his way through the sales business by following his ideology of treating customer as people with heart not as numbers as they are the one who gives business to them and not the other way around. also stressing on focusing on services before sales. \n\nrealistic movie definitely worth a watch.","label":0},{"review":"these movie is genuinely a awesome crafted movie where they showed the journey of sales man. i have come across many of ma friends/classmates who chose marketing during their graduation days thinking it's easy subject to clear than compared to finance subject. but truth is marketing is not the cup of everyone where actually they showed in these movie. love the ranbir acting and the narration of struggling graduate !!!
