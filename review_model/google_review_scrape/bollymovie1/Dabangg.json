(even his pants drop in this one). \na formidable villain - tick \n\nin short, dabangg 3 has everything crammed in its two hour fifty minutes run time just to please the lowest common denominator which comprises salman's loyal fan club.\n\nwhat the film doesn't have is a story, sense and sensibility. now now, dont take me to be an elite prude or a bhai hater! i aint. infact, i personally liked his dabangg 1 (2010) and few recent blockbusters like bajrangi bhaijaan (2015) and sultan (2016). i genuinely tried hard to enjoy dabangg 3 as well but failed. \n\nthe first half is pathetic where nothing - absolutely nothing - happens. the family shamily drama is a yawn and chulbul pandey's (salman obviously) backstory with his young sweetheart khushi (saiee manjrekar) is unexciting, to put it mildly. that debutant saiee looks like salman's beti in the romantic scenes makes matter worse. ..\n\nnext, the main villain bali singh (kichcha sudeepa) enters the frame, falls for chulbul's girl and begins his full on rivalry with pandeyji. \n\non the films only positive, kannada superstar kichcha sudeepa plays a truly effective antagonist and actually steals the thunder from salman bhai in most of the scenes he appears in. brilliant! \n\nsaiee manjrekar looks pretty but gets too small a role to prove her acting chops. sonakshi sinha, reprising her role of rajjo, is strictly okay. pramod khanna fills in for his late brother vinod khanna's prajapati pandey role. one misses the original munni malaika arora's sexy thumkas in the 'munna badnaam hua' item number. \n\non the tech front, editing by ritesh soni is below par. prabhu deva's direction is even worse. more woe, the songs are not a patch on the previous two installments and they keep popping up every ten fifteen minutes to slow down the already sluggish narrative. the action finale is stretched beyond a point of endurance. \n\nfinally, dabangg 3 seems to be a hurriedly made and haphazardly assembled product which adds no value to the franchise. \n\nsince a decade or two, salman khan has been repeating himself in film after film. nevertheless, he has achieved remarkable success churning the same outdated content to his star struck fans. the question remains, for how long??!!!!\n\nregards\nsumeet nadkarni","label":0},{"review":"this is a really full masala movie..\nas a salman fan, it is a really good

performance in the interval sequence is outstanding. \n\nafter two breakneck fights, the first half gets slow due to the flashback episode, while the second one is brilliantly executed with explosive action and solid writing. \n\nthe action sequences are just outstanding and breathtaking. each and every set piece is excellently handled. technically, this film is a visual masterpiece. cinematography is splendid. music is also charming. there are a few very well-written twists as well. \n\ndabangg 3 is in short an entertaining action comedy that has the right mix of action, humor and emotion, despite some slow pacing and abrupt song placing in a few parts. for salman/action genre fans, this is an unmissable blockbuster worth experiencing on the big

what a come back. there are many things i love about especially the one liner war #phrasesandidioms if you wanna talk about action one word #prabhudeva (the god) is the director so don't expect it is

start in present then we have flashback and then present onece again but what a way to show that. the movie answered so many question like how chulbul gets the locket or the style of sunglasses and many more. how he become the police officer. what is impressive that in the last quater of bollywood that the bollywood is back on track where we can have great #villians i mean from #comando3 via

\nsalman is so confident about his stardom power and his recent box office records that he activated his father salim khan’s writing genes and written the story of this film. lo bolo, after two hit dabangg films he remembered why he became dabangg for the first time? it’s typical bollywood cum tollywood revenge story with larger than life fight sequences meaning by one hero beating 15 to 20 villains and sometimes of his double size. it’s out and out salman’s film and as chulbul pande he continued his ora with screen presence and his staccato speech in dialogue delivery. songs are speed breakers in the film and comes every 15 minutes making film’s tempo slow.  only “munna badnam hua” song is visually delight and entertaining. two heroines are like ‘aachar paapad’ in the film. saiee mahesh manjrekar is good but very poor chemistry with salman. she looks like salman’s daughter or younger sister. sonakshi has little to do in this film as salman’s ct all wife rajjo but their chemistry is okay. but best and impressive character is baali singh performed by southern superstar sudeep ( hero of film “makkhi”). it seems that there is vatki vehvar between bollywood and tollywood. akshay kumar and sunil shetty becomes villain in rajnikant’s film “2.0” and upcoming “darbaar” and tollywood superstars are becoming villains in bollywood films. sudeep looks like javed jaffrey but his body language and expressive eyes steals the show.  there are so many character artist like arbaaz, dimple kapadia, mahesh manjrekar, prabhu deva, warina hussain as item girl are like side dishes.  prabhu deva is director of the film but songs are averagely choreographed except ‘munna badnam hua’. like shammi kapoor, salman has his personal in built choreography moves and only they can carry their dancing styles. \n2.5/5.  salman fans in rest of india and sudeep fans in southern belt will make it blockbuster.  timepass entertaining film may soon come on amazon prime.","label":0},{"review":"dabangg 3 movie review: salman khan packs in punches and blows in this masala entertainer\n\nthis is the third instalment of the 'dabangg' franchise, and the audience is well-acquainted with the larger-than-life, lovable cop and his world. chulbul (salman) spends his average day romancing his wife rajjo (sonakshi), troubling his brother makkhi (arbaaz) and fighting and reforming goons. all is well, until he busts a prostitution racket and saves a bunch of girls, which angers the ringleader, the rich and powerful balli (sudeep). cut to, chulbul pandey’s beginnings, a huge chunk of the first part of the film is about his younger days, his love interest – the beautiful and naive khushi (saiee) – and the circumstances that urged him to turn over a new leaf and become robinhood panday.\n\nthere are ample clap-worthy and seeti-maar moments in prabhudeva’s 'dabangg 3' for salman khan fans to lap up. yes, he takes off his shirt, flaunts his well-toned, perfectly-greased body and beats up the goons to pulp. the action is raw and solid, however, some action scenes (like chulbul's introductory sequence) are unreasonably stretched. while the story is clearly predictable, in this one again, salman’s star power, swag and style remain intact. there is an attempt to infuse comedy in the story, but it seems rather forced. the storyline is not cohesive and the narrative is loosely strung together.\n\nsudeep is menacing as the baddie, who is out to make chulbul’s life miserable. the south actor has a great screen presence, which makes the face-offs between chulbul and him impactful and entertaining. sonakshi was seen as rajjo in the first two movies of the franchise, too, but in a film that’s primarily about a tussle between the good and the bad men, she doesn’t have much to do other than play the loving and doting wife. saiee, who makes her debut as young chulbul’s lady love, has a pleasant screen presence and is effective, but she could do with expressing more in the emotional scenes. arbaaz plays his part well.\n\nthe film, with a runtime of 2 hours and 42 minutes, seems very long and could have done with a tighter edit. the narrative is also interrupted by a long line-up of songs, of which, the memorable ones are 'munna badnam hua' and the title track.\n\noverall, the film has all the ingredients required for a massy masala entertainer — good action, music, drama and, of course, salman packing all of this in one story. the portions where the actor throws in comedy while doing hardcore action scenes are nicely done. 'dabangg 3' shows salman in his element – throwing deadly blows at the villains amidst all the smoke, dust and fire, while you can hear chants of hudd hudd dabangg in the background. and those certainly will be paisa-vasool moments for salman khan's fans.","label":0},{"review":"i loved the movie thoroughly enjoyed it with my family. each time i watch my salman's movie my love for him grows

are you wondering if i am promoting all these aspects or planning on writing about this in the read, you needn’t worry about that because they bundle it up in this movie.\nbeing the 3rd of the franchise, the movie is all about how the origin of the protagonist, carved into the officer he had become to relinquish his personal vendetta to reak vengeance, chulbul pandey alias 'robin hood' well you could say ‘robbing without the hood’. the officer of the law, who single-handedly resolves the issues of his locals, a promising patron and supporter of women's empowerment. the direction is mainly focused on all the hypes the main lead might have to promote his presence on the reel.\ndabangg 3 movie’s foothold centralized on the flashback of both protagonist and antagonist crush over the same female character and how things end up being rusty in the due process.\nwell, in the present, everything circles around the personal vengeance masking under the badge and corrupt lawmakers.\nthe movie is limping all the way long from the entry of the main lead bulldozing his way through the wall, caricatured fights bubble wrapped with dance moves and karate poses. romancing the leading ladies while promoting his contemporaries and old songs is becoming more of his marking trait in his movies.\nantagonist entry portrayed by the southern star, interestingly projected but when the movie is more of bits and pieces pasted together which didn’t stick, so not much of his histrionics expected from his screen presence. other character artists feebly furnished their respective roles as a minimal screen presence of their character’s webbed for the movie.\nthe movie speaks about the major social norms that are engulfing society but when the main lead is being projected with double standards; the aspects zest lost during this process. the writer teases with the memory of the audience by tampering with the relationship of the main lead and his father.\nthe audience will not miss the ads or the social norms faced by society. the one-liners are pathetic and losing flair. dialogues are cheesy and substandard. a movie will keep the edge of your seats for sure but for other

connect with a certain innocence salman carries with him.\n\nprabhudheva owned this zone with wanted but he’s kind of repeating himself with dabangg 3. he still has some tricks left under his sleeves but it tests your patience. he portrays salman khan’s heroics in the most heroic way possible. it takes optimum advantage of slo-mo technology. it would’ve been 10-minutes shorter if you speed up the fighting sequences.\n\na very enthusiastic pair of sajid-wajid kills the watching experience multiple times. they throw unnecessarily songs at you fracturing your thoughts about the film. awara’s placement is good, munna badnaam hua will work with its target audience. the rest of the songs serve no purpose whatsoever. background score ranges from very good to pretty naive such as using the by-default stock youtube sound-effects. liked the usage of the modified dabangg theme & the sound of ‘bad a**’ in between.\nall said and done, dabangg 3 is for every single of salman khan fan out

great dialogues and was not overloaded with crappy songs. the music was great in the first part and almost all songs were chartbusters at that time. the franchise lost its essence after abhinav kashyap left the franchise and it can be clearly seen in the last 2 dabangg films. \ncoming back to dabangg 3, it's almost 3 hr film overloaded with everything that everyone expects from salman's film. but the problem is the presence of too many songs at frequent intervals that really tests the audience patience and with coming of baadshah as one of the music composers for the film, the music is literally a pain in the ears. also most of the action sequences are in slow motion and that really puts you off while watching the film. it's surprising how prabhudeva directed wanted back in 2009 if he couldn't stop dabangg 3 from being such a big let down. also time and again people have disliked salman khan singing songs in his own movies but he seems to be unaffected by the criticism for his singing and has continued to sing another pathetic song where he is seen dancing with sonakshi sinha. \nthe first thing that many critics and moviegoers must understand that not all films can be preachy, biopics or address social issues in the society. there are movies made just for fun and audience is supposed to enjoy it for 2-3 hrs and leave their brains aside. dabangg 3 comes under that category.\ncriticising dabangg 3 just for the lack of logic isn't right because if that's the case then hollywood has been churning out such movies in abundance every year. movies such as terminator series, mcu films, dc films, mission impossible series, fast and furious series and many more. in all these movies the basic plot is a group of people ganging up against a baddie who is on a mission to wipe humanity. so don't listen and bother about critics such as rajeev masand, anupama chopra or sucharita tyagi who will throw some heavy and fancy words from oxford dictionary and fill your mind with the mentality that whenever hollywood throws commercial potboilers such as avengers at you is great but it's not the same when indian filmmakers do the same. \noverall dabangg 3 is a one time fun ride and can be watched once with friends and family. \ndon't go with too many expectations and leave your brains aside while watching the film because if you can accept rajnikanth, ethan hunt (tom cruise) and james bond single handedly fighting underworld dons ans mafias then why not chulbul pandey.","label":0},{"review":"movie review: dabanng 3\n\n************* warning: minor spoilers ahead**********\n\nit is unbelievable (atleast for me) to think that the first installment of the dabanng series came out 9 years ago. unbelievable, that the universe of chulbul pandey is almost a decade long.\n\ni'm a hardcore consumer of escapist cinema - my logic in life is not to see depressing movies on the screen. if i want to see a real representation of life or slice of life cinema, i'd rather watch it on netflix or on any other ott platform. thats my personal opinion. my life is already depressing, so when i see a escapist movie, i want to see a larger than life character caricature and flying cars and weird dance choreography.\n\nbefore i even try to form an opinion on this flick, lets discuss about the parameters. to judge a salman movie, you can only compare and contrast it with a salman movie. indian cinema is often sub-categorised into sub-genre; comedy, slice of life, horror, etc. and then there is even more minute genres; rajnikanth, salman, srk, etc. these types of genres cannot be compared with any other but themselvds.\n\nso lets discuss about dabanng.\n\nlets get the elephant out of the way first - dabanng 3 is an almost 3 hour long flick just to marvel at one thing alone: salman khan. nothing else is relevant. i often people people love to write off salman as a star more than an \"actor\" especially in the masala genre. i dont blame them. salmans strength is also his weakness. chulbul pandey is so much of salman, you dont know when salman disappears from the screen and chulbul appears. salman has lived with this character for almost a decade. you know ajay, ranveer and akshay all has played the quintessential masala cop - but no one can play it better than salman as pandey-ji. chulbul is probably salmans greatest character ever. period.\n\nthough one might get offended by some of the homophobic, sexist and ageist \"jokes\" in this film, one could still argue this is plausible in the world of dabanng. no other character apart from salman has enough meat or skin to really talk about. kiccha sudeep is good, but he didnt get an arc in his characterization. he does terrible things but my favorite villian yet still remains chedi singh (i mean how could i forget he killed dimple in the first installment). saai and sonakshi is there. i did miss vinod khanna though. \n\nthis movie tries of answer alot of questions that dabanng 1 raised. like how did pandey ji get his name as chulbul. or what inspired him to (now iconic) put his shades behind his collar. or what inspires his paisa-wasool dialogues such as \"hum tume itne chedh kar denge...\" but it also confused and meddled up with alot of other things for me as well. for example, how does it the flashback chulbul and makkhi share such a warm relationship. or why is pandeyji (senior) nice to chulbul. or how did chulbul didnt know kushi and rajjo were related - did he not pick up the photo album ever, in these many years of his marriage?\n\nmy complaint with this movie is with his song choices. firstly whats the need for forcing a \ni could talk about the story, screenplay or the cinematography - but the end of the day one has to realise this is a salman khan movie. anything and everything is possible in the dabanng world. it is a good, but not best version of dabanng. everything is presented in a larger than life manner. dont think too much into it - you know what you are to expect when watching a salman movie. \n\nis this a movie im going to remember in a months time? no. is this a movie that entertained me though? yes.","label":0},{"review":"dabangg 3 – movie review\n\nprodued by salman khan, arbaaz khan and nikhil dwivedi, d3 has turned into a successful franchise after the previous two thriving outings. this time it is prabhu deva who wields the megaphone. the success of this film is of importance to sk after his recent fiascos.\n\nstory? well, this is a sk film, so dilip shukla(writer)  doesn’t try much, he lazily mentions some scenes that have made sk the star he is for years. the usual sk frolics is strewn every inch of the screen and his fans might lap it up however laborious it may seem, but for the rest you look around the theatre to see if you are the only one who is not having fun. there are a number of scenes in the name of comedy that are squirm worthy and so unbecoming of the star that sk is. the movie is all about how the dabangg became chulbul pandey(if you truly cared) and for that you get to see the “supposedly” cute side of sk in the screenplay. the angry dabangg returns post the flashback to haunt us for the rest of the film with no respite.\n\nsalman khan as usual has worked very hard for the film, not on screen though, but in the gym. sudeep in an underwritten role showcases briefly why he is one of the finest actors down south. sonaksh and saiee do what is expected out of a sk’s heroine, act dumb and look good. the rest deliver their “dramatic” performances to the t.\n\nmahesh limaye’s cinematography works very well and is at times ingenious too. sajid wajid rehash most of their tunes that are badly placed and their background score turns out to be annoying. dialogues surprisingly are silly, regressive and offer no relief. editing by ritesh soni is half baked. prabhu deva disappoints as the director.\ndabangg 3 is no surprise, for sk fans and not so sk fans.. slick for them and sick for the rest. \n\ndabangg 3 – dabba !\n\n1.5/5\n\nb.u.shreesha","label":0},{"review":"right now if salman khan stands in front of the camera twitching one eyebrow for two-and-half hours, he'll guarantee a 200-crore hit. dabangg 3 gives you more than that, of course. it unleashes the superstar in full fury and flair.\n\nessentially, the sequel continues with the idea of giving the genre of comicbook cinema a twist of kitsch. chulbul pandey, rockstar cop who gave salman his newfound mojo with the first film of 2010, was perhaps the apt bollywood specimen for the job. the film carries on with imparting a cocky smalltown spin to the hollywood western formula.\n\nif dabangg 3 was always about salman khan revelling in top form, the superstar doesn't disappoint. he makes chulbul pandey even more lovable this time- cool shades, wry humour, crackling stunts and smooth chemistry with the pretty sonakshi, all very much in place. did you seriously need any more reasons to watch?","label":0},{"review":"a start which seems as a not-that-great parody attempt of previous salman's entry scenes.. followed by painfully slow 1st hour to create context for action scenes to follow. villian portrays a darker role than previous dabaang movies which possibly is the only intriging part in the first half. action scenes remind of sultan, jai ho. slow mo scenes are forced, and seem inspired from few famed south indian movie scenes. dialogues are bland and unmemorable, except few instances elucidating origins of chulbul's famed dialogues in  movies 1,2. the first half attempts to show sulman's innocence/emotions, female empowerment messages etc. but is painfully slow and predictable if not unbearable at times. also you miss vinod khanna!\n\nthe second half gives hopes to be the start of the movie that fans came to see. it's satisfying to see how n why chulbul becomes dabaang! prequel explains dabang 1 scenario nicely. songs are still misplaced and have nothing to offer except the catchyness of munna badnaam, dialogues are atleast hit or miss, action scenes still at 4x speed. makkhi's character goes on a senseless arc. bali gives you the perfect villian that you could see chulbul struggling against providing you high hopes for the climax which is kinda flashy with cgi and slo mo but not entirely enjoyable. the complete movie has a south indian parody-comedy-action movie flavor with the dabaang recipe repeated but somewhat doesn't meet expectations.\nall in all, only hard core salman fans may enjoy the movie, which otherwise isn't worth a second watch!","label":0},{"review":"when\n(1)  the hero is the bhai of the masses- salman khan\n(2) the director is the king of masala style of movie making &

is his entry, for the first time i believe here in bollywood for one action scene a different action director has been recruited besides the otherwise action director & the result is grand with the public clapping & whistling in this introductory action sequence,  not that this is only at the start there are many such action scenes & dialogues to get this feedback again & again, the story in this third part  goes to flashback  showing chulbul pandeys past & his first love who was killed by the villian & how then cp came into the police force, the second half  back to present & revenge  time & finishing the villian, of course nothing new but then it is salman khan with his style..... critics & classes might call it overdoing,  masses & his fans call it apne  bhai ki  bhaigiri & they love him for all this & he after the disappointing bharat this time delivers, as the villian kichha sudeep is average playing a cool & calm kind of character, sonakshi is the same while the new face saiee manjrekar is a disappointment more or so because of a limited screen time, the comedy track between rajesh sharma & paresh ganatra is entertaining & reminds of jeetendra movies having kader khan & shakti kapoor jodi,rest all actors/characters have hardly anything to do & especially  to see a performer like bharat dhabolkar being wasted is sad ,music is a big letdown...\ndabaang is only

pandey’s journey from a young man named dhaakad to police officer chulbul pandey, and his fight with the demons of his past. this is the third instalment of a famous franchise 'dabangg' and the audience is well-acquainted with the larger-than-life, lovable cop and his world. chulbul (salman) spends his average day romancing his wife rajjo (sonakshi), troubling his brother makkhi (arbaaz) and fighting and reforming goons. all is well, until he busts a prostitution racket and saves a bunch of girls, which angers the ring leader, the rich and powerful balli (sudeep).its a,chulbul pandey’s beginnings, a huge chunk of the first part of the film is about his younger days, his love interest – the beautiful and naive khushi (saiee)and the circumstances that urged him to turn over a and becoming robinhood panday. \ntrade analysis: salman khan did exceptionally well in action scenes especially in the climax. it is a treat to watch salman charishma. the film also conveys social messages. locations are well captured by cinematographer mahesh limaye. prabhudeva as director could deliver much better product.  the story is predictable. dialogues are well written. the film looks like old one in new package.  romance between salman and saiee manjrekar does not digest due to age gap. sudeep is overshadowed by salman’s character. warina looks sensuous. pramod khanna fills the

muscle power unprecedented but unbelievable as well. bhai will be shown spreading humourless dialogues at the police, villian and at his unusually fearless wife who seemed to acquire pandey ji's bravery only for her very first appearance in the movie and remained neglected (has nothing to do with the story except routinely appearing in songs). he is shown shirtless (occasionally pantless as well), fighting with hundreds of goons at once, intentionally trying to induce some humour with his very nasty jokes and annoying repetitive dialogues. the movie is powered by slow motion scenes( his girlfriend, a medical aspirant, chess champion, never detected at college, was shown slowly drifting downwards, tears rolling down her cheeks, her expression changing rapidly and then blood stained face of bhai, (apparently failed to save her)). the scene was ridiculously long, further lengthening the already long movie. \n\nthe movie presents a back story about how an unemployed, muscle man became inspector chulbul pandey (  the name 'chulbul' earns itself a sub-story), who the villain is, his horrific crimes and his encounter with bhai. villain was supposed to be killed by bhai himself ( as a revenge ). but he returned again in pandey ji's present life, threatening his family, continuing his crimes. \n\nthe movie is action packed but the plot is boring, story not compelling enough

dozens of baddies single handedly and yes does the mandatory topless act as well. \nhowever, absence of a cohesive story or rationale to happenings on the screen (even by bollywood’s low standards for such hero centric flicks) robs the film much of viewer interest.  there is nothing that we haven’t seen before perhaps with the exception of a new method adopted by the villain to torture the hapless females - hanging them over a precipice... so much is the creative bankruptcy.  the film meanders with endless flights with we looking at the exit door furtively for a reprieve!  is the salman charm

this, as i am also a part time writer and if i would given a chance to write for dabang 3 i would also have written it on similar grounds. story has nothing new in it but the message is well conveyed. \n2. action sequences are awesome. i am not comparing it with movie war, but with earlier parts of dabang series. \n\ni can't think of any other pros in this movie. \n\ncons-\n1. dialogues are something that you will not going to remember after you leave the theatre. but i like one dialog in the climax \"jeet humesha burai ki hi hoti hai, kyuki humse bura tumhare liye koi nahi ho sakta\".\n2. there are many useless songs in this movie which has so unusual timing and length that you may get confused if you are watching songs which contain a movie in it. \n3. the acting

long. perfect length to make a person bored. \n\neven if it has a decent storyline but the script was little weak which is the only reason why this movie fails to reach everyone's heart. inspite of

flashback portions. sonakshi sinha as expected lends support. she looks energetic in the songs. newcomer saiee m manjrekar seems beautiful and tries her best.","label":0},{"review":"one word disaster...i went to the theatre with zero expectations and came back with a sleepy and a bored face... prabhudeva had been known for making such masala movies but the only good movies of his which were wanted and rowdy rathore both of them were remakes and this time he tried to something original or fails miserably... salman khan acting is just cringe and it's not surprising that he has written this... said manjrekar does an average job.. sonakshi sinha should just quit making cinemas and learn ramayana (kbc joke).. the songs were ok.. sudeep was the only person trying to wait me up in this messed up movie..😡😡😡😡 not recommend don't waste ur money like i did..","label":0},{"review":"a quality entertainment .. dabangg franchise is bigger and best of all time.. movie has all the factors and

\n\nno wonder sk is an entertainer . \n\nmr prabhudeva , with due respect . please do movies like \nnuvvostānaṇṭē nēnoddaṇṭānā\n\nmr kichchaa  do you have talent is not a question at all . please select movies that you can perform rather than commercial pot boredom boilers \n\ni never expected you to see as a villain rather do movies like tom\nhanks movies \n\n\nyou can set standards by doing performance oriented movies \n\nthink smart filmmakers we are happy to spend money what we want is good content with great message and entertainment .","label":0}]
