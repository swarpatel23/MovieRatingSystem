[{"review":"one of the best movies ever to be made. one of the most mature, sensible and thrilling movie ever. filmed so realistically that it defied the usual jingoistic film making methods of that period. maybe that's the reason for it not doing so well in the box office. it followed the pattern of andaz apna apna which was again a box office failure but a cult movie these days. \n\nthe plot chosen, the acting and mannerism of each individual involved in this film is actually praise worthy. hats off to a movie like this.\n\none of my top all time movies.. can watch it as many times with the same interest as the first time.","label":0},{"review":"fantastically well made and gripping tale of police, bravery, tactics and deceit. arshad warsi sets aside from his usual funny characters and dons the uniform of a no nonsense ips officer. sushant singh was brilliant in his portrayal of the bad guy (cinematic portrayal of gangster shriprakash shukla). pankaj kapoor was brilliant as always in the role of physics professor. absolutely no dull moments in the movie. i can still watch the movie over any present day movie.","label":0},{"review":"this is one of the best movies, arshad and sushant were fabulous and pankaj sir as usual was superb. mahima also has done justice to her role. sad that it flopped but really a must watch movie due to the storyline, characters and above all
