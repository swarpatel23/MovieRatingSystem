[{"review":"sridevi is truely a superstar. she was such a versatile actor that no matter what role was presented to her , she did it in her own beautiful way. this film , like every other srideiv's film is unique in its own way and also one of my favourites.\nthe movie is very thought provoking and leaves and impact on how we treat our mothers at home or what and how much respect do we pay to housewives. the story also has a touch of inspiration in the way shashi (sridevi) is determined to learn english but there is also a true motherly touch at the same time that more than anything else, her family is above all for her. \nall the charachters have performed so well that it left a smile on my face.\nlastly , i would to recommend this film to all the people who enjoy watching such sweet and simple films.","label":0},{"review":"this movie is sheer perfection. it captures one of the best performances of the great actress- sridevi ji. she will always be remembered for this film. gauri shinde has done a remarkable job! thank you for such a motivational and light hearted movie ma'am. i have watched this movie many times  and can watch it for dozens more! i  would recommend this movie to each and every person out there <3","label":0},{"review":"this movie is great in every department be it acting, music, direction, message . the acting of whole cast is fabulous and there doesn't feel anything that is done extra or done less. the music is great , credit to amit trivedi for creating such great music. sridevi's will to learn english gives a powerful message that we should work very hard to achieve our goals and be ultimately successful. i have watched about a dozen times and can watch it about a dozen times more , such family movies are a rarity these days. overall 10 on 10 for the movie.","label":0},{"review":"truly a realistic cinema instead of a women oriented cinema.. never classify movies like queen, fashion, kahani, chandini bar... and this as women oriented cinema... these are to be named as real cinemas... movie had best story, direction,visualization and perfomances.. \nsridevi was really a superstar who is correct choice for shashi. her personality is apt for the role as she is very innocent.. \nthank you gauri shinde for this movie... mother are to be respected at home their big qualification is love.... srideviji deserves the national award for this role","label":0},{"review":"beautiful movie!! sridevi does not merely act, she lives, that's how extremely talented she is. shashi potrays every indian middle class housewife, always working for her family without a thought of herself, her comforts, her little needs , her joys or her insecurities. it's always the family ( most often thankless and uncaring towards her, always taking her for granted). it's a thought provoking movie that everyone should see.","label":0},{"review":"💯 ⭐️each time you watch this movie!\ni am sure it gonna make you smile, the screenplay is impeccable. leave

english nobody is going to give respect to us. they will call uneducated . that's why english is very important. but in last scene sri devis english specch was fabulous. her daughter and husband were dumb.","label":0},{"review":"wonderful film .sridevi was living like shasi.such an fantastic motivational film .l love the music too ,thanks for amit trivedi.there are many life's in india like this.living only to take care of family but there hardwork  is not always appreciated .l hope the film will make change in that attitude.","label":0},{"review":"i love this movie very much i watch
