[{"review":"lootera(2013):a movie that is centered around the conflict between love and betrayal,memories and tears,and  the immortal and mortal.\n\na beautifully crafted film,with mesmerizing and great performance from both ranveer and sonakshi.\n\nthrough-out the movie you will experience only feeble sounds,be it during the conversations or at other times,(which itself is a beautiful aspect that will connect you with the script and the minds of the characters),but the acting and the music of the film themselves have spoken out loud enough,enabling each and everyone to hear and feel the magic of love.\n\namit trivedi has literally transformed his music into one of the characters in the movie itself- playing a very major role.\nand i personally felt that this is one the greatest and memorable performance by sonakshi in her acting career. \n\nlootera :a magic-a masterpiece..","label":0},{"review":"the film is based on the 1907 short story ‚Äòthe last leaf‚Äô by o. henry, in which the heroine knows she will die when the last leaf falls, so the hero paints and ties paper leaves on the tree until he can do so no more. the music by amit trivedi, including hits such as ‚Äòsawaar loon‚Äô/‚Äòi‚Äôll decorate my heart‚Äô, evoke the 1950s and the golden age of hindi film music.\ni think it is by far the best work of sonakshi sinha. she's extremely talented and natural in her acting skills.\n\ni just love the movie","label":0},{"review":"masterpiece. \nthe locations, the sets, the dialogues and the performance of the actors, all things together, not only make this movie worth a watch beautiful experience, but also make you live, like literally go through each n every feeling what the characters express, creating a perfect vibe of that post-independence period. vikramaditya motwane gives you, not just a movie, but an experience to feel.","label":0},{"review":"a masterpiece by vikramaditya motwane. we often get someone in life who teaches us to live again. we don't have to regret for that last leaf to fall, we can always wait for the monsoon to arrive again. i can clearly remember the last scene when pakhi is sleeping in varun's arms, like she is sleeping peacefully after a long time. and then varun gets up and starts to leave. his eyes were still at pakhi. that heart wrenching visual of seeing your loved one, for the last time, by making her learn to live again.","label":0},{"review":"one of the remarkable movie in indian film history. 2 hours of heart warming romance and a great ending to back it up. the film capture the great  scenic beauty of dalhousie an the era of 1950's.\n\nessentially it was a heroine driven movie and sonakshi sinha is not disappointing at all. well i think she was the best actress to play the role. one of the greatest ending in hindi movies. definitely an underrated movie.","label":0},{"review":"surely one of the best movie one can ever watch. concept of the movie is remarkable, unique and it left you spellbound

the movie has ended.","label":0},{"review":"a part of this film is like the last leaf written by o. henry. well, one of the best thing of the film is ranveer's \"not-so-good\" boy look and his fab
