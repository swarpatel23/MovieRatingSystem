[{"review":"i loved the film. the performances were good. background score suites the emotions of a 13 year boy who is not matured enough. story revolves around a 13 year boy named shambu. obsesssed by his classmates, his mother and his step-father, he decided to leave all the things and cycled towards a new life. the movie narrates his embarked journey with a slum boy who once tried to stole his cycle. the bond that both shares is the most lovely thing and the most strongest once. however i was disappointed with the end as it let me wonder about the slum boy and how shambu was back at home.\nin the end i would like to say that it's a bumpy and emotional ride.\na treat to all the kids and a lesson to all the tenagers.\ni will go with 4 stars. and will give 85% rotten tomatoes.\nrate-****","label":0},{"review":"i think this movie do great work for society .and i also support the acting of armaan malik .he is looking so cute in this movie .i think that armaan' s acting was .😂😂😍😍😍 very fine","label":0},{"review":"awsm movie specially...armaan's song ..jab ye sitaare love u armaan ....💖❤️❤️💖...but i m not getting this movie on utube...","label":0},{"review":"armaan is very telented.armaan is best in the world for me.i love him verymuch😘😙😙","label":0},{"review":"this movie is a very emotional and motivational. 🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅","label":0},{"review":"i think it is best movie in world","label":0},{"review":"did not understand the storyline of this film","label":0},{"review":"nothing interested","label":0},{"review":"grt performance.. original n refreshing","label":0}]
