[{"review":"a film which is lush in appearance and star cast, but very malnourished in script and direction. srk plays a dual role and gives full justice to it. kareena too has done a great job. the place where ra one fails, is a good story. it is absolutely baseless and meaningless. the direction is done in bits and scrambles, and makes the audience feel miserable after its screeentimw. the only saving grace of the film, are its thunderous song tracks and a lively performance exhibited by the lead cast, with a special mention to the dubious performance of kareena. although her chemistry with srk, is not being given enough light, she does manage to save the film‚Äôs fragile story with her eccentricity of dance and diversity of emotions, making the sluggish film , a little more interesting to watch and enjoy. i give it 2/5.","label":0},{"review":"for all those critics and people who didn't like this movie, you all are illiterate. when a foreign movie with same concept and execution comes out, these people jump right in to criticize bollywood for not attempting such movies. and when these kind of movies do get made you all say it was bad. i mean come on. i know the story wasn't anything sort of spectacular but you've got to admit, it was one hell of an entertainer.\nalso, i wanna say to all people, please don't judge a movie by it's reviews only. these critics just like those so called 'art films'. i think they are biased. commercial cinema never gets praise from them.\nand just to make it clear, i'm a cinema lover. i like all genres of movies. i also watch indie movies too. but all movies don't need to have just 'story'. some have to be entertainer. and i appreciate it. there are a lot of aspects to cinema and one should notice it all not just story. that's all i wanna say.","label":0},{"review":"i don't wanna say much i personally very much like this movie,and i appreciate the fact that they made this kind of sci fi movie i bollywood.this movie is a masterpiece, i know it is not perfect and a little lose at some points but it is a sci fi movie, what do you expect?\nhollywood is been doing this for such a long lime and everyone likes that ,so why not give bollywood a chance?\nthe only reason this film crashed cause this movie was way ahead of it's time in india, but now india thrives for such movies\nkyunki sb wo chutye pyaar wali stories se bored ho chuke hain\ni don't know when we are gonna get similar movies in bollywood like this again","label":0},{"review":"i think,this movie was released on wrong date. because that time people do not understand the value of graphics. it should be released in 2019-20. because it is based on action ,science.at that time few people know about the science fiction movies.now they are developed they didn‚Äôt know  that ra one is the wonderful movie.\n\ni love it very much and i have seen it more than 200 times ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ \n\n\nnow i am waiting for the 2nd part.i hope that film maker will

always tried to do something new but indian public only wants and accepted from bollywood is only bollywood masala, item song and romance. even ra-one movies grafics are lot better than bahubali. in bahubali there are so many flaws. i am from that department so i knew.","label":0},{"review":"people those not liked this movie are really illitrate...  if they not like this movie then why they are

bollywood is concerned, there has been a lot of ‚Äúmutation‚Äù and ‚Äútime travel‚Äù. but ra one delivers something new. it was the first time in bollywood, that someone made a movie with ‚Äúwave-particle duality‚Äù and ‚Äúconversion of energy into matter‚Äù as its core concepts. but this didn't strike with the audience very well. why? because they had problems understanding it.","label":0},{"review":"it's a  superb movie in context of indian cinema. srk and his production company red chillies have achieved excellent achievements regarding improvement of indian cinema to

characters, song(chammak challo) and science fiction. ra.one was fully capable of becoming superhit film of 2011 but due to strange people of india its popularity got destroyed. other wise it is out of glitches","label":0},{"review":"the movie jumaji was very well appreciated in which characters enter a video game  and broke box office records.\nwhile in this movie, a character came out of the

new and amazing concept with some great acting and emotions it's sad that people were finding reality stuffs in a superhero film and the same people would love a marvel film üòè. . it was great in cinematography and different from the regular films and deserved greater appreciation","label":0},{"review":"this movie posessed the potenial to become  the best scripted conceptwise movie of 2011..but just because of narrow visioned n stupid indian tunnel minded people it failed to gain much recognition...had it been released on todays date this movie would definitely be a blockbuser coz afer seeing movies like robot 2.0 wih such loose concept yet gaining popularity it can be assured that ra. one would have been n epic movie for todays generation!","label":0},{"review":"i will appreciate srk sir ...not only bcoz i'm his fan...but srk sir always try something new in the bollywood...but some of them think that a movie like spiderman and batman are good bcoz they are made in
