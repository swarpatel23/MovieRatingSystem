[{"review":"movie is sort of watchable because in 1st half,audience remains totally confused as director unnecessarily stretched the movie and there was no point in it. the movie actually begins from 2nd half and we start getting thrilled. but seriously man i don't know what abinay deo wanted to present on screen. screenplay of the movie was sort of lazy in 1st half. bgm in this movie was just like missing. acting by actors was also up to the mark. i am not saying that movie is a headache or unwatchable but director should make clear about what he wants to present on screen.\nratings:5/10. this is just a mere one time watch.","label":0},{"review":"i liked the movie.  i probably one of the few who really like abhishek bachchan.  i loved the way the killer was exposed.  i also loved that ab‚Äôs character was undercover agent.  i suspected that because he was shown too fit for just a nightclub owner.  i agree second half was much better than the first.  i really liked the song ‚Äúfalling in love‚Äù.  kr looked good but acted bad.\nand mr. mahapatra, kabir malhotra had an identical twin iqbal malhotra who appears at the end with a gun.  gauher khan‚Äôs character was his daughter.  they together plotted to kill kabir malhotra along with his daughter tisha after learning about her.  \n\nnice movie.  i might watch again.üòÑ","label":0},{"review":"it‚Äôs worth 0 stars. \nworst acting, impoverish direction, poor editing, no story. \ndon‚Äôt want a minute, watched it because it came up as a 96% match on netflix. i wish i had googled it. slept half way through. \n\nsave your valuable time.","label":0},{"review":"movie is a total hit but loses just a single point... \njust because\n\nwhen abhishek (undercover agent) checks out anupam kher he himself and declares him dead... with no sign of heart beat and breathing ? then howcome.. ?... he gives a wild card entry at the last...?..  \nan undercover agent ...?.....üòçüòÑ \nheehee..","label":0},{"review":"okayish. good to watch at home on a lazy afternoon. kangana‚Äôs character is a joke. abhishek‚Äôs character has been improvised after half the movie was filmed.","label":0},{"review":"worst movie i have watched in sometime. can‚Äôt understand why netflix put it in their collection. the more i think about it the more my blood boils. i hope ppl understand what ki dog movie it is.","label":0},{"review":"movie is good, but kangana ranaut's acting was the worst part in the movie she didn't looked committed or anyway connected to the script, finally shows us she is not good for thriller or suspense type of movies.","label":0},{"review":"never seen any movie more boring and plotless with the worst acting from each and every cast. please i request don't waste time watching this absurd movie.üôè","label":0},{"review":"nice movie,you can watch it one time if you are a thriller movie fan.....","label":0},{"review":"truely great story..but the plot is too obvious to guess..great for one time watch..","label":0},{"review":"songs are good... locations r also good.","label":0},{"review":"don't bother watching it even if someone pays u a billion dollars","label":0},{"review":"abhishek is good for work","label":0}]
