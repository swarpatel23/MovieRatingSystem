[{"review":"this movie stand in the list of my favorite movies. nice, wonderful, fabulous, awesome movie. i watched this movie 5 times but i never bored till now. pair of kareena and sahid kapoor looking very good. they both acted well as usual especially sahid makes the big difference between his today's acting and those days acting. he is looking very cute. kareena did justice with his punjabi girl image. all the songs are melodious and heartouching especially yeh ishq hai sung by legendary shreya ghoshal ji.  location where movie  shot was attractive and mind-blowing. superb composition of songs and music by pritam ji and too good direction by imtiz ali ji.","label":0},{"review":"this is my all time favorite movie. i can watch this thousand times without getting boar. kareena kapoor played naughtiest role of a punjabi girl in the movie.the chemisrty between shahid kapoor and kareena kapoor is amazing. both played well with their characters. music is awesome. i love the songs and one of my favorite song is \"awogay tum oo sajna angna phool khilenge\" by this movie shahid proved that he can play the serious role very well. the movie is mixture of love, emotions, entertainment and comedy. in the first half you will feel like smiling  and in second half you will feel like crying. even after so many years i love watching this movie and consider it one of the best romantic movie i have seen till now.","label":0},{"review":"the best !!! my all time favorite movie. the chemistry between shahid n kareena is something that holds ur breath throughout the film. added to that is the charm n magic of the songs. they're just so emotional n relatable to the whole picture... one can't stop him/herself from getting into the aura of the film. everytime i watch it, i feel as if i'm living every moment with geet n aditya.☺besides bebo, shahid's acting is truly commendable. the way he has portrayed aditya is something that no one could do. \nkudos to the whole team of jab we met..!\nlove you 💕","label":0},{"review":"i love this film ❤️ forever .... its a movie which teaches wide lessons to ones life ...iss movie ne jene ka funda sikha ...diya n this is the power of this movie..and obviously..box office ka collection kitna bhi ho ....but i think this film is almost liked by all .....this movie proves that shahid can also play innocent roles ...and that also with kareena mam ....when i saw the movie i was of 8 and obviously. i was really very much innocent at that time ..but nowadays ago....only i saw the movie ...and was turned to a fan ... actually lover of this movie...if shahid me mira mam as shaadi nahi ki hoti ..then i ll be trying ...😅 actually now i am having actual waala crush on shahid cause the way he always react or behaves with an unknown girl ...is also like he is with his own ...relatives or friend....he knows how to own sabka dil.....so ...i think also deserves the answer ...from us .....i love u ....and i would like to add that this is a cute love story...😍","label":0},{"review":"i love everything about indian movies. even if they sometimes come as unrealistic, but this movie is something different.  kareena kapoor is simply amazing n the  chemistry between her and shaheed was incredible. shaheed also proved that he can be taken as a serious actor.\n\ni loved the songs and the simplicity of the sets. there were no over-budgeted scenes of indians living abroad. this movie was all in all indian in its essence and that's what made it a big hit.","label":0},{"review":"this is my all time favorite movie. i can watch

truly... only then will you get it... \nif you see it in the mind you hold in your hand!!!","label":0},{"review":"this movie is surely imtiaz ali's best, containing finest dialogues & chemistry between actors. it's one of the finest romantic-drama genre movie.\nstarting from meeting of a typical punjabi girl to a disheartened businessman in train to changing his outlook and marrying him,this movie changes the lovers internally.\nsomewhere down the lane every man wants a happy 'geet' before the interval- of 1st half😊","label":0},{"review":"jab we met is my all time favorite movie , this is the best movie of my life..it is very close to my heart my life. i often think that it relates to me,i have geet in my life who really changed my life, i like kareena kapoor in the movie a lot because of her acting, she is so talkative and looking good with casual attire and makeup. i like the chemistry of geet  and aditya, how aditya changes in second half of the movie is really great.","label":0},{"review":"i saw this movie just before few minutes from now. it depicts the distinct love story of a businessmen who has forgotten every enjoyment of his life and one cool extrovert girl who just knows how to enjoy life and doing things which she loves to do so. the movie also gives scenes of manali, a bit of  punjab's tradition with awesome songs. it is more than a one-time movie.","label":0},{"review":"a movie with charismatic charm of the human character & the essence of echoing human emotions..\nworth cherishing if one is to praise the complex emotional cacophony of how human relations are beyond the narrow concerns of life & gives a social message to this hypocritical world that life is never to get urself confined to the problems in life but rather enjoying it to the fullest & let things fall into their places...\nhope this aspires others to watch again & again...","label":0},{"review":"jab we met movie is the best movie ever in bollywood

riveted to chair as you do in a crime thriller. not one second of drag. \nwhat is more relevant are the dialouges of both karena and shahid. it is unfortunate that the understated acting of shahid remained not appreciated but to my mind it should have earned him the best actor award. \nthe chemistry of both is the real usp of the film","label":0},{"review":"one of my favorite bollywood movies

movie i have seen, from kareena’s “who gives world the damn role,” to shahid’s silent, serious, loner yet compassionate role and then transformation of both into each other’s character and upbringing each other when other facing the downhill with no expectations just with compassion and love, the movie excels in every corner from the dialogue, shahid’s and kareena’s acting, music (even now i have all the songs of this movie) etc etc.\n👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻","label":0},{"review":"when the movie released i was just 2 years old .i first saw the film in 2017 when it completed 10 years .in an instant i fell
