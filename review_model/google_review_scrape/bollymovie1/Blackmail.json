[{"review":"a film to be heavily lauded for its experimental approach by dealing distinctly with subjects that are social taboo that receive little or no attention at all on account of complex societal norms. centering around an unhappy man who suffers from the burden of paying his monthly installments, loans and emis and who suffers from a little more than undesirable married life named dev whose only solace seems to limited within the walls of a compartment in his office bathroom where he does the needful after stealing photographs of the wives of other employees. so urgent is his thirst to quench his sexual desire that be goes on to hide his face in a mask to steal the photo of his boss's wife and when further precautions are taken he desperately brings in the imaged figure of a woman in exposing attire. and all through, the company where he works....which promoted conservation of water is prompted repeatedly to the audience in the backdrop through posters and labels stamped on even the bathroom walls which brings out the ironical paradox. the cat and dog chase that ensues after dev decides to black mail his wife's lover has been skillfully sequenced with equally gripping music to give the tension. khan speaks through his eyes as he does in all his films, playing the titular character. the supporting cast performed with appreciable consistentsy with divya dutta and gajraj rao topping them. the screenplay was amazing and khan had his emotions under his grip to produce it in the most appropriate bits in the most suitable time. i give the film a 3.5 out of 5.","label":0},{"review":"#blackmail #reviews #darkcomedy #irrfankhan #comedy - 3.5 thumbs up üëçüëçüëçü§ô\nblackmail is comedy of errors with lot of quirkiness and is definitely quite engaging. it has all the ingredients to make it a fun watch.\n\nit's story of a middle class man and his struggles; monthly emis, limited salary, sales pressure and a deceitful wife.\n\nirrfan khan plays the role of a middle class man in a pitch perfect manner. he is so submissive to every situation in his life that you pity him. he looks so helpless still you never know what next trick he is ploting in his mind. rest of the cast play their part impeccably.\n\ndialogues are witty and comedy is situational. director abhinay deo gives another unconventional and offbeat film after delhi belly. his direction has that kinkiness and freshness which is not there in most of the bollywood movies.\n\nmoney and the need of it, makes you do crazy things, that's what it portrays. there is no surprise that most of the henious crimes happen due to normal situations turning outrageous.\n\nblackmail deserves to be watched for it's simplicity and bizzare plot.\n\np.s. the expense statement is quite chucklesome and hilarious.","label":0},{"review":"absolutely non-sense and worth avoiding !!!\n\nfirst half makes sense though slow.but second half takes away movie in different and unwanted

tightly knit story. hats off!","label":0},{"review":"not that good, characters were loosely coupled, there was no need of chatur ramalingam in this movie. even story was quite weak and it ended abruptly. i think it could have written in a nice way. \ni saw that it's imdb rating is 7.2, may be because it's a irrfan khan movie, that's why most of the people gave it a good rating. but i think it doesn't deserve more than 6.","label":0},{"review":"great movie. it breaks the monotone of bollywood. the youth will like it for sure. the film tries to find humour, doesn't overtry to inflict
