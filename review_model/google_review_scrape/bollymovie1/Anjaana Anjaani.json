[{"review":"ranbir was at his best like all movies, but i didn't like the role of priyanka, no offense but each time she broke the feeling. the first half is very promising and some scenes in this movie are very memorable.there drawbacks:\n1. too much time is taken by songs in second half, i wanted aas paas khuda to be in the background.\n2. priyanka looks like a gone case as she is depressed and suddenly is partying and no time taken to transition from depressed to happy\n3. the movie becomes exhausting at some points\ngood points:\n1. aas pass khuda, anjaana anjaani and hairat are very nice songs\n2. ranbir takes time and shows reasons of sad to happy transitions\n3. zayed khan\n4. ranbir's suicide reason\n5. memorable scenes.\noverall i give it a 7/10 rating and a part by part watch movie. priyanka was disappointing, in my opinion. i have no\nmy review is about the film and i don't have any problem with priyanka chopra it's just the  film's problem not her's","label":0},{"review":"my all the time fav one \n\n\nit's one of the best movie i have  ever seen ..hats off to mamta anand for writing such a heart touching script ...siddharth anand direction is impressive ..he melted hearts .. both ranbir & priyanka are too talented this movie will prove it ...such a gorgeous & talented priyanka is... vishal & shekhar touched hearts by such a beautiful musical renditions..career best music by them ..must watch it to feel the love from depth of heart ..","label":0},{"review":"2019!😂 i just watched it.. n u know what i luv this about that \"positive vibes\"... actually if u loved someone n u don't have them anymore in your life. well that the movie which makes u realise who u really are.. it's not about story it's not about song..it's all about \"destiny\".. cuz tu na jaane aas paas hai khudaa..\n\npriyanka chopra- all time favorite..\nranbir kapoor- always amazed by his acting skills\n\nmovie- 8/10\n\np.s - it's one of the best movies that's all😊👍👌","label":0},{"review":"i just love this movie's storyline like how destiny introduces akash n kiara while they're attempting to commit suicide, then bumping into each other again at the hospital, then their various attempts at ending their lives n failing each n every time n eventually falling in love n realising the true importance of life. ranbir n priyanka have totally surrendered themselves to their characters n they have done a fabulous job especially ranbir n his heart-melting expressions n his outburst in the song tujhe bhula diya. anjaana anjaana is a must watch movie for the die-hard romantics.","label":0},{"review":"in this movie, priyanka chopra and ranbir kapoor was acting, it was so amazing but \ntell us that how can you become suicidal friend. ok i know this movie named as \nanjaana and anjaani but you have to tell us\nwhat was the situation of that scene that you are separate yourself and her. i think that you are good friend in relationship. ranbir kapoor do not forget that you are looking so handsome and cool and especially priyanka chopra do not forget that you are looking so beautiful and gorgeus in every movie. your and ranbir kapoor was act in \" tujhe bhula diya \" song was act so much good","label":0},{"review":"great movie.. based on a french movie \"a girl on the bridge\" . \nthough great acting by ranbir...but i think priyanka was a bit off... no offence she is great in her own way but...i think deepika would have done a great job with him or katrina.. as in ajab prem ki gajab kahani.. movie is great you will love it. watch it !","label":0},{"review":"my fav movie.. i relate to dis movie.. i have seen dis movie about 50 to 60 times.. such a huge fan of its story.. i want my kife story to be exactly like this one.. i luv
