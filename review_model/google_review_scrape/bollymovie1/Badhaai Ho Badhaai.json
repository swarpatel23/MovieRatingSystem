!! they have two grown up sons and that is why they feel all the more awkward of breaking the news to the family about the arrival of a new member in the family . “ samaaj kya kahega “ , “ log kya kahenge “ is what bothers them more. gajraj rao of tvf fame... plays “jeetendra kaushik” aka jeetu who is a ticket checker in northern railways who is on the verge of retirement and has a very loving wife in neena gupta who plays “priyamvada” . the “kaushik” family stays in delhi’s lodhi colony with two grown up sons “nakul” played by ayushmann khurrana and “gullar” played by shardul rana along with their old grandmother played by surekha sikri . \n\nwith an excellent storyline , the credit for which goes to script writers , akshat ghildial, jyoti kapoor and shantanu shrivastava they stitch across a story showing the middle class delhi family in such a wonderful manner by taking care of the smallest of details in the colony where they stay and even the people around them behave . it feels so real that one can really relate to the things happening around the family . in complete contrast they also show the high society of delhi in which you find a suave mother played by sheeba chaddha and the heroine sanya malhotra who plays ayushmann’s love interest “ rene “ . \n\nthe movie stands completely on the performances of the lead actors , specially gajraj rao and neena gupta who with the expressions in their eyes emotes such feelings that as an audience you feel for them and are completely ready to be a part of their journey of bringing the new member into this world . we get to see a lot of gajraj rao these days in youtube web series , however we need to see him more in such challenging roles in future too. however someone whom we need to see more on the silver screen is neena gupta . she has given such a lovely performance that one tends to feel that it is a loss of not being able to see such a fine actress regularly on the screen. from many art movies to “ choli ke peeche “ song with madhuri to the serial “ saans “ this talented actress needs to be applauded for one of the finest performances she has given till date . when you speak of performances... surekha sikri who plays the grandmother is in top form . it’s rare to see such roles of character artists leaving a mark like what she does . even sheeba chaddha as sanya’s mother in her limited screen time does a very good job . \n\nthis movie is not about ayushmann and sanya... so although we get to see their love story too... but as an audience we fall in love with the romance of “jeetu” and “priyamvada” where even the romantic glances or the small “nok jhok” that they have in the movie brings out a smile on our faces and as an audience we come out of the theatre with a huge satisfying and happy smile . ab ladki hui ya ladka... “ kaushik” pariwaar ko “badhai ho “ kehne ke liye ... hum sabon ko seh pariwaar theatres me jaana chahiye 😊👍🏻 you all will love it for sure as it happens to be a comedy movie which one will laugh to with all your heart and soul . my recommendation... a must watch 😊👍🏻","label":0},{"review":"badhai ho! \n\ncongratulations to film makers and audience to come to an age where such movies are getting produced and ‘delivered’ and audience accepting refreshing change or asking for such movies, making it a hit. content/story and powerful acting are the winning combination here.   \n\nit’s a light hearted comedy movie woven around human emotions which a family goes through when unexpected good news breaks out and life changes for them as society and relatives reacts super surprisingly too.\n\nstory starts with middle-class-middle-aged couple gets unexpected good news of unexpected pregnancy and how with the time, unexpected good news becomes acceptable by all characters specially grown up adult kids in the family and what all they go through with their respective friends, neighbors, relatives, office colleagues as everyone has a peculiar reaction. things are portrayed realistically and interestingly as the story progresses.\n\nit needs a special mention that veteran theater artist surekha sikri playing the role of grandmother “dadi” steals the show with her powerful acting performance and overshadows others when it comes to screen share. her witty one liners are strong punch lines in the movie and sarcastic ones.   \n\nthere is important element of ‘simplicity’ in characters and audience can identify them in real life around us and movie surly gives a progressive message to accept the changes happening in society, accept the things (which one can’t change) gracefully and grow up beyond the mentality of “log kya kahenge”.\n\nit is must watch sensible warm family entertainer.","label":0},{"review":"ayushmann khuranna has become synonymous with offbeat films, covering a wide spectrum from “vicky donor” to “badhaai ho”. not all of them are very entertaining though, this one added to the list.\n\nstory revolves around the life of a typical middle-class family in delhi where an old grandmother lives with her obedient son gajraj rao, dutiful daughter-in-law neena gupta and two grandsons, ayushmann being the elder one. their lives turn topsy-turvy when neena gupta becomes pregnant at a relatively old age bringing embarrassment and uncomfortable moments for other family members. ayushmann’s love life with sanya malhotra also takes a beating in the process since he takes maximum time to adjust to the new environment. finally, the family members overcomes their inhibitions and inner stigma to bond together to welcome the newborn with deserving happiness.\n\nall the actors have performed well with surekha sikri stealing the show as strict, authoritarian but soft hearted grandmother who vents out her feelings in choicest of words and expressions regardless of situation or person at receiving end. the scene where entire family sees the baby for the first time is scripted beautifully and acted in a manner characterised with intense feelings. \n\nthe movie starts on a promising note, paving way for a comic roller coaster as the trailers suggested. but soon the soda fizzles out with comedy getting replaced with sentiments and emotions at a slow pace which dampens the mood. laughter moments are there, but sprinkled sparsely or probably promotions of the film had set wrong expectation. either ways, go for it if you are a sucker for melodramatic family dramas. i found it ok ok types.","label":0},{"review":"wonderful movie came to us as gift from amit sharma in festive season.lovely acting

even. sanya is fesh n effort less. \n\nnow movie-such a simple story can tell so many plots, emotions, feelings,reality of our society. the last sceene when the kaushik family sees n welcomes their

values and social systems. while pregnancy and motherhood are celebrated, subjects like sex and romance are talked about with a degree of embarrassment and awkwardness. the concept of 'badhaai ho', where a quintessential delhi couple; parents to two adult boys (one of them is of marriageable age), get pregnant out of the blue, is just the sort of subject that can ruffle-up feathers within the middle-class family system. yet, this dramedy, based on children feeling terribly embarrassed by the outcome of their parents’ mid-age romance; with outsiders joining in the criticism, conveys some really progressive thoughts. the situational humour of 'badhaai ho' is complimented perfectly, by striking performances from gajraj rao, neena gupta and ayushmann khurrana. this film is as funny as it is liberal. the conversation around the fact that romance and passion have nothing to do with age, make this film a stand out for many reasons. \n\nthe kaushiks live in delhi’s lodhi colony, a run-of-the-mill setting, where family affairs can tumble into the next home through adjoining balconies and windows. so, when jeetender and his wife priyamvada find out about their unexpected pregnancy, the news spreads like wildfire. neighbours get curious, but the knee-jerk reactions come from members of the kaushik household. the two sons are shocked by the fact that their parents still have an active love life (read: sex life), while the grandmom (surekha sikri) is appalled by the news, too. steering clear of clichés and stereotypes, the writing of shantanu srivastava and akshat ghildial brings in some genuinely likeable moments. the way the parents break the news to their family is hilarious. priyamvada’s colony friends feel happy for her, while her own children are almost left red-faced by the news. the on-screen romance between the parents, replete with 80s and 90s romantic songs playing in the background, is absolutely endearing. the well-crafted dialogues add to the hilarity of the situations.\n\nyou don’t expect actors playing ‘mom and dad’ to have as much screen space as the young leads of the film, but director amit ravindernath sharma actually puts the spotlight on senior actors gajraj rao and neena gupta. their romantic moments are the veritable highlight. same goes for their performances, too. neena gupta is excellent in her portrayal of the unsettled mother. gajraj rao’s performance is the best thing about 'badhaai ho'. in fact, he steals every scene that he’s a part of. just his body language, mannerisms and expressions are enough to make you laugh out loud. not to be overshadowed, ayushmann, too, is in top-form, playing the son who feels the brunt of the social pressure. so much so, that his relationship with his girlfriend, reene (sanya malhotra) gets affected, too. surekha sikri, who plays the dadi, deserves a special mention. she’s old-fashioned for various reasons, but when it comes to taking up for her bahu with a baby bump, she unabashedly tells the rest of the family that it’s admirable for couples to be in love and have “sexy” (meaning sex) at this age. sanya malhotra, who plays the girl with modern outlook, breezes through her role.\n\n'badhaai ho', much like its subject, puts a fantastic new spin on the usual. in a new-age rom-com, you’d expect ayushmann and sanya’s love story to take centre stage, but when you see the middle-aged parents blush with romance, the entertainment really becomes novel. the music by tanishk bagchi, rochak kohli and jam8 is top-grade, too. tracks like 'badhaiyaan tenu', 'naina na jodeen' and 'sajan bade senti' fit the mood perfectly. the film engages thoroughly, while still making a social statement. even though the story has a limited scope, the detailed writing, the finesse of sharma’s direction and some unforgettable performances, make this film an absolute winner. \nrating 4.5/5 it is a must watch.","label":0},{"review":"#badhaaiho\n\na life bite

the two outstanding features were the acting of \"daadi(surekha sikri )\" and the \"content\" of the movie. every time daadi came on screen, your eyes go wide in excitement, your stomach goes on a laughter roller coaster and your jaw drops in the awe of the perfection with which surekha ji has slayed the role. gajraj rao(father) was just close behind with his perfect expressions of amusement, nervousness and and love towards his wife. neena gupta doesn't need any reconfirmation that she is an actress par excellence. i loved the delicate details in the movie when a typical middle class husband in a monotonous job comes back home and shares the excitement of his poem, published in a magazine, with his wife, in a closed room, away from the whole world. how romantic! ayushmann kuranna(nikal padi 😁) and sanya malhotra did justice to their roles and all the supporting cast was fantastic, no matter how small the role was. yes. .sheeba chadha also deserves a special mention. i love the movies which have the ability to transport you in their world or if i may say. ..your world, which you have lost touch with. it shows that for good content, you don't have to do astrophysics

waiting for. ....go watch it 😊","label":0},{"review":"badhai ho badhai is a welcome change from formula films coming out from the bollywood stable in the last few months. a simple script pictured in an endearing fashion, the movie manages to move you at times. acting is avant garde. neena gupta and surekha sikri steal the show. ayushman khurana and sanya malhotra form a good pair. khurana's acting is subdued and well nuanced. the only dampener is khurana's heavily punjabi accented hindi. at times you wonder if you are watching a hindi movie or a punjabi movie. south indians will find it difficult to understand punjabi and haryanvi dialects. an unexpected pregnancy embarrasses a family and mercifully the mother decides to go ahead with the pregnancy instead of terminating it. the grown-up children find it difficult to accept that their parents have an active sex life but eventually they reconcile to the fact. khurana's girl friend (sanya) is pretty cool about it though her mother (sheeba chaddha) cautions her that the child will eventually become her responsibility. gajaraj rao has great screen presence and manages the comedy sequences very well. the locales add immense value - be it lodha colony in delhi, railway station, meerut. one feels so happy for neena. she was always sidelined by mainstream bollywood ; she was forced to do sidekick roles like the one in feroze khan's yalghar or playing side kick to madhuri dixit in the dance \"choli ke peechey\" in subash ghai's khalnayak. this role is a role in a lifetime for gupta - she might win a couple of awards. you actually see an ageing middle class housewife priyamvadha kaushik and not neena gupta the actress. there lies in the success of the director in his efforts to extract best performances from all actors. every actor has got a meaty role and this is where the script appears to be balanced. shardul rana has delivered a good performance as khurana's younger brother. one wishes that one had an elder brother like khurana - protective, strict and affectionate.\n\ndefinitely worth a watch.\n\ndo not miss it.","label":0},{"review":"what happens when a couple in their 50s, in a moment of passion, end up having an unplanned pregnancy? that is the quirky, unusual story of 'badhaai ho'.\n\nnakul kaushik (ayushmann khurrana) cannot come to terms with the fact that his parents, father jeetender aka jeetu (gajraj rao) and mother priyamvada (neena gupta) are going to have a third child. nakul has an adolescent younger brother gullar (shardul rana).\n\nthe film centres around the middle-class kaushik family who live in lodhi colony, delhi. the setup is perfect with 'mata ka jagrata' songs, housewives playing housie/bingo, uncles dancing to 90s bollywood tunes at weddings, prying neighbours and more.\n\nthe movie gets you engrossed in minutes as the couple discover that priyamvada is 19 weeks into her pregnancy. the most hilarious parts in the movie are the ones where the couple has to share the 'good' news with their family and friends. in particular, the scene where gajraj tries to awkwardly talk to his young sons, and later his mother (surekha sikri), will crack you up. he is so self-conscious that he can't look them in the eye, till they finally accept the news.\n\ngajraj portrays jeetu with a vulnerability and innocence that creates an instant rapport with viewers. you want to empathise with the couple when they become victims of judgment from their immediate family members when they announce the pregnancy.\n\npriyamvada is at the centre of what follows, as a pregnant mother in her 50s. along with the physical strains of pregnancy, comes an emotional strain and neena gupta delivers a well-balanced, measured performance. she is desirable, her husband reads out poetry to her behind closed doors and \"applies red lipstick, although her sons have grown young\", as her mother-in-law disapprovingly points out.\n\nsurekha sikri is appalled when she hears the news. she throws the usual mother-in-law jabs at priyamvada, but stands up for her when the extended family express their embarrassment at the late pregnancy. one scene in the second half will warm your heart -- the conservative sikri defending the couple saying it is not wrong to be in love or be intimate at any age.\n\ndirector amit sharma thoughtfully captures the love between the middle-aged couple as they steal glances at a wedding. in another track, we have nakul in a relationship with reene (sanya malhotra) and the awkward spat he ends up having with her mother (sheeba chadha). sheeba appears in the film only for a few scenes and yet leaves a mark. she is a woman of few words and leaves a maya sarabhai impression. the strength of the film lies in the script and 'badhaai ho', written by akshat, shantanu and jyoti, explores an uncomfortable subject delicately. there is attention to small details like the steel water filter in their kitchen, the family visiting a local doctor at a small dispensary, aunts applying lipsticks to each other at a wedding, the kaushiks driving a 13-year-old car, probably bought on the savings from the father's government job. the world they create in a delhi colony is believable and the characters relatable.\n\nkudos to ayushmann khurrana for choosing unconventional scripts and hitting the bull's eye each time. be it 'vicky donor', 'shubh mangal saavdhan', 'andhadhun' and now 'badhaai ho'. we can't wait for his next pick.\n\noverall, 'badhaai ho' is a wholesome movie - amit sharma takes us on a laugh riot and packs in the right amount of emotional moments that leave a lump in your throat. don't miss out on this unlikely family entertainer.","label":0},{"review":"extremely entertaining ‘badhaai ho’ is exactly how a film should be. amit ravindernath sharma’s film grips you, engages you, hits you hard on your face, wakes your conscience up, yet entertains you. a sure shot winner. you celebrate pregnacy and motherhood in your family, but what if a middle aged couple gets pregnant? does it remain the same? to add to it, if this happens with your own parents, would it remain as happy? badhaai ho is a reminder that breaks the norms, doesn’t adhere to ‘log kya kahenge?’ and makes you see the taboos with the eye of normalcy. with a colorful approach towards togetherness and redefining love and affection even in the middle age of life, the film is a powerful addition in the list of bold films, aiming to change the way we live. ayushmann khurrana once again delivers a top notch act making you fall for him. proving he’s actually carved a niche for himself, he makes sure his choice of roles are something to study. in every shade of his character, he gives his best. you actually don’t see ayushmann but only nakul behaving and reacting to situations in his own life. sanya malhotra is wonderful too. in her restrained act, she shines like bright sun. her character has depth and is very real in terms of practicality.but the sure shot winners of the film are gajraj rao and neena gupta. no word is enough for their scintillating act. their chemistry is something to die for.music by

\"badhai ho\" by suvas agam\n\n“badhai  ho” simply means congratulation to you. in indian subcontinent we congratulate our beloved ones on many occasions. in this movie we get rarest opportunity to witness the unique phenomena happening in family. a mother of around fifty gets pregnant. it becomes extremely awkward situation to break the news to two adult sons .the news spreads in family and neighborhood. indian society takes a bit more interest in others affairs, this becomes quit a situation where adult sons get so embarrassed that they even don’t dare to go office or college just they don’t want to face the situation or comments. when girlfriend of one elder son tells this news to her widow mother who is supposedly don’t believe belong to middle class family. this widow mother of that girl makes fun and criticizes this act of old women being pregnant as a symbol of lower or middle class behavior which by coincident is heard by elder son (ayushman khurana). this becomes the pick moment when he starts not feeling guilty of his mom being pregnant. same thing happens at another family party where these two sons do not participate just because of shame of mom being pregnant. all women criticize the pregnant mom as shameless act and as not mature or did of a class. and here we witness amazing dialogue of dadi or granny who admires the pregnant mother as women of class and dignity. \nwe feel kind of worried as a people of twenty-first century society when these two grown up sons behave as if their parent has committed a great sin. later when they hear of other people making fun of this story, suddenly realizes that this is not something to feel ashamed of. we also come to get insight that we have almost made assumption that old age is just the age of retirement. no romance is the right of old aged people. this movie in one aspect teaches or inspires old aged people to enjoy their life. at the same time it also inspires one to create a bond in family. \nin the market when we are hearing so much bad review of “thug of hindustan” people are talking that in so much low budget with no explosion, no foreign shooting, no fight and no hi-fi props too one can create such a beautiful movie. i will recommend you to watch this movie with your family. you will feel more loved and more in harmony with your beloved ones. i would love to congratulate director

critical review\n\nit is hard to justify by the film industry in the recent times about the importance of creative liberties and its position as one of the doyens of public consciousness when it finds itself in an awkward position of stifling the creativity to do a job for others.\n\nbadhaai ho is one such film. even with a limited though, one can get an understanding that the story essentially is spun around the promotion of three industries: tobacco, alcohol, and contraceptives (expanding business to older cohorts). and because the natural responses to a pregnancy at that age can be just so much, they stretched it by filling it up with frivolous scenes.\n\n‘middle class’ was lavishly stereotyped with an intention to draw some laughter. and the makers did not feel it incumbent upon them to put on the helmet on the actors riding bikes. unbelievably, there was a scene in the movie which shows nakul (ayushman) asking his younger brother to hit a boy (who abused him and his family) so hard that his cap falls off! wow, bullying lessons 101. talk about the film industry being an example to follow.\n\nwell, if you intend to watch a 125-minute-long behavioral change lesson, you might

realizes that the mother is pregnant. \n\"badhaai ho\" is a hilariously weaved, properly executed and well performed movie by the entire team. the scene when the grandmother gets the news of

doesn't forget to hold on to certain values of family that we seldom watch in bollywood these days. there is an incredible scene where the grandmother finally speaks for her daughter in law and

10/10\n\nbollywood seems to be on a role, forcing me to rate a full 10/10 for the last 3 releases ( andhadhun, tumbbad and now badhaai ho). the day the trailer for this movie landed i was so eagerly waiting to watch this on the big screen as the premise seemed so hilarious and original. and i wasn't disappointed a bit.\nthe film has a very basic and simple plot. a couple in their 50's who have 2 children, get pregnant. the social stigma and embarrassment that comes from the society and their own family forms the crux of the story. the film is brutally honest and simple in it's approach and never goes overboard into preaching on what a society or family should be like. they don't lay down golden rules or have big speeches. \nthe hero of the film is it's brilliant script, hat's off to the writers (shantanu, akshat, jyoti). amit who directs the film treats the film and subject with a meticulous approach. the depiction of a typical middle class 'delhi' vali family is so on point without going into stereotyping. running into just a shade over 120 minutes, the movie never bores you because comic situations continue to arrive in every scene. the movie is a laughter riot and the emotional scenes gave me goosebumps and teared me up a bit.\nwhile the script is the hero of the film, the heroine of the film has to be the excellent bunch of actors. meet the kaushiks( you have to ask the little brother why it's kaushiks and  not kaushik's). jeetu(gajraj rao), priyamvada (neena gupta) play the pregnant couple. dadi( surekha sikri) plays jeetu's old mother. nakul (ayushmann) and gullar (shardul) play the sons. everyone is mind blowing throughout, their expressions are so on point. gajraj, neena and surekha jee steal the show with their brilliant portrayals. they seemed to be living the characters. ayushmann is on a role, back to back brilliant movies and acting. \n\nbadhaai ho is a brilliant comic caper that just cannot be missed. it's heavily entertaining and you will

thumbs up for the director.though a laugh riot, innocent, witty film, it leaves a lump in throat at certain scenes by the sheer portrayal of characters by the actors. i just went to watch a movie after a good no of years, it  surprised me like anything by its freshness & uniqueness....if you ask me rating it will be 4.5/5 for execution & 5/5 for concept, acting.","label":0},{"review":"movie goes with a realistic views and reactions of indian society toward such an unpredictable incidence. dialogs are very simple, not fake or filmy. music is fresh and soothing. all characters are strong

a powerful script and acting... we all know the subject from the trailers itself. but how it is showcased was awesome.\ncudos to ayushman for giving us another good film.\nthe unconventional scripts are well depicted by him wether it was vicky donor or shubh mangal sabdhan or this one.\na must watch movie for movie gowers who believe in good scripts and films without dance numbers, without khans, without skin show.","label":0},{"review":"great light-hearted movie.... initially i didn't want to go for the movie coz it's not easy for me to trust that it will be worth my time (not that i do great things with my time but i can choose, can't i?) but my wife and son wanted to watch the movie and so that's the sort of situation that i usually don't get the luxury to choose how am i going to spend my time.. but i am glad i went for the movie because we all enjoyed it fully from beginning to the end. really good movie...","label":0},{"review":"in my opinion it was *** i was reading some reviews

bond between a traditional indian mother in law and her daughter in law though it doesn't normally come to the fore...both these moments brought tears to my eyes....it also tells us that differences between social classes dissolve in the face of simple good human nature and behaviour...and gundagiri is alive and kicking...:) loved neena gupta, gajraj, ayushman, the younger brother, dadi-most- of- all....and renee and her mom...real classy is what she proves to be!","label":0},{"review":"badhai ho its a awesome comedy  family dramasized movie.i was really got impressed by ayushman's last movie
