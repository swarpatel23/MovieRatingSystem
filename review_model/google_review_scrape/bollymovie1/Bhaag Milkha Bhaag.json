out. he ran (\"bhaaga\") for his life, as he turned back to look, he saw his family being butchered by swordsmen on horsebacks. he was just a child, age less than 10. he grew up to be an excellent runner & represented india in international competitions. but his phobia never left. he could still feel shadows of those swordsmen on horsebacks coming for him.....\nsuch trauma. i wonder if could have lived through it and still shine the way he did!! üôèüôèüôè","label":0},{"review":"bhaag milkha bhaag is perfect role action practical experience and handsome young man strong and healthy new
