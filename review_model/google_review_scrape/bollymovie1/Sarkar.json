[{"review":"whoof!! sarkar has managed to break all the shackles spun around its release !. heavy criticisms( promotions) from political parties 😁 . !! third film in arm vijay combo.\n\nthe plot is a well known fact among ppl even before its release !.vijay , an nri ( corporate criminal) comes to india to cast his  vote and finds that someone casted already .the usual cat and mouse drama starts here . hey hey .but hold on wait !!  except its a political drama ! ! ..\n\nvijay anna 's earth shattering screen presence holds this movie firmly. style quotient 😍😍😍😍🤗 the way arm unveils the knots spun around the plot is amazing ! unlike the past 2 blockbusters , sarkar looks a little different. maturity in annan's acting and the way film progresses are the key points.  clap worthy dialogues all around !!  arm sir hats off for this script!! first half is racy and power packed with many paisa vasool scenes !! as a die hard fan , my throat went gaga over thalapathy's mass moments!! 😍😍..\n\n         second half is a rollercoaster ride with many political influenced moments which happened here( not willing to quote those scenes as these incidents are well known ) . the way in  which the interval block carries itself is a delight !! cute body language transitions from anna ! a welcome change!! most fav scene would be when he challenges radha ravi sir , unga thalivan brand eh eh kili kili nu kilichu kaatren followed by thalapathy 's sarcastic gestures !! 😍😍😍..\n\narr sir😍. bgm's top notch 😎. that too title card bgm ku i ll surrender myself 😍😍.. girish brother hats off !! new dimensional cinematography 😍.kollywood welcomes you with a red carpet! stunt scenes ultimately steal the show ! high octane !😍.ram lakshman!.😎.varu sarathkumar mam😍.. top notch performance. may her badass and terrifying performances continue!! . karuppaih sir vera level 😍 keerthy comes in just as a doll with no mere purpose !😑.but still commercial template to be followed !🙄..\n                 the film starts loosing  its grip from the audience in the second half slowly.  😶., but then somehow thalapathy manages to pull it back with grungy dialogues ! logical loopholes😞!! at some point of time , as many tell its like a political launchpad for vijay ,the scenes just deviate much from their mother , script which made me slightly glum 😖.. nevertheless , sarkar looks formidable with sharp social messages oozing out 😍😍. tomato and hospital  scenes 😍😍 arm nailed it 😍😍\n\n         finally , to be honest  , sarkar slightly misses out the x factor of arm vijay annan combo 😶,otherwise os a good and much needed film for everyone ! kelvi keknum was the show stealer and i hope instigation of this thought into people's minds would be strong !! \n\nverdict : go and give it a watch for vijay  annan's charisma sandwiched strong social content( 49p) 😎😎 ( which we all need now to the maximum 🤗) \n\nmy rating ( as a die hard fan) : 9/10\nmy rating ( assuming a neutral audience) : kathi thuppaki level illanaalum one time watchable aah iruku indha sarkar 😊   : 7/10","label":0},{"review":"this is a detailed review after watching the movie on a weekday(15th day after release) without any fan crowd to bias me.\n\nsarkar is a socio-political drama which runs on the fulcrum of most of the current events in tamil nadu(probably why audience in kerala could not relate to the same). it is not a usual kollywood utopian political movie(mainly made famous by director shankar's mudhalvan) which promises the moon, has great theatre moments, has a sincere hero and a scintillating antagonist. neither will it match your expectations if you went in thinking of vijay-arm's previous block-busters-thuppakki and kathi which were cinematic delights with some social messages thrown on them. the movie is more on the lines of director mohan raja's social drama velaikkaran, if you definitely need a comparison although i would not want to bias you. \n\ncontrary to most online reviewers and english newspapers's verdict, i never found the movie to be dull and in fact was quite surprised when the movie got over, with a run time of 2 hours 43 minutes. \n\nregarding technicalities, ar rahman's music and bgm is a huge plus(again under-quoted in most of social media reviews), girish's cinematography is okayish(simtaangaran could have been better). ram-laxman's stunts slightly over on top. choreography is a big let down(does not match to the tunes for the most part- shobi and sridhar wasted good songs with vijay's magical steps at their disposal). \n\ncoming to director arm and writer jeyamohan(whose contribution again under-quoted in most reviews), i would say dialogues are razor-sharp and if you are someone connected to the ground realities of tn(that is big if!),you will definitely feel as if they reflect your mind in most of the scenes. regarding screenplay, definitely the expectations of thuppakki and kathi play spoilsport as the 12-terrorist shoot-out and coin fight are huge benchmarks for even the original director to match with. again,here arm has directed the movie as a common man rather than a director and probably the reason for the slackness here, if you go in only as a cinema lover. \n\nregarding production values, sun pictures have pulled no stops with good artwork in songs and fight scenes only to be spoilt by insipid choreography as mentioned before. appreciate them for having the spine and guts to take criticism of their own related political party in a movie produced by them. \n\ncoming to actor vijay, hatsoff to him for openly taking on politicians including the party connected to the production company. he has carried the movie on his shoulders and lived out the role. no other contemporary actor has dared to take up issues affecting tn and its people as vijay has in most of his movies in the last 4 years and sarkar is the pinnacle among them all. if there was one reason you should watch the movie, it is for vijay.  \n\nconsidering it is a one-man show due to charismatic vijay, having 3 antagonists makes it even more harder for any of them to match up to him. lesson here for atlee and future directors of vijay movie- have that one strong raguvaran-type villain to stand the might of vijay rather than a multitude of them and end up them looking lesser.\n\nin short,if you are a cool dude/dudette, take-a-chill-pill types, only alive in virtual world, sees movies to hang-out with boy/girl friends, better avoid sarkar and do whatever you keep doing.\n\non the other hand, if you are someone who is connected to what are the chronic problems which are ailing tn and felt disgruntled, frustrated and angered at any point in the last 2 years and want to bring about a positive change for the better, you will definitely connect with the movie! just dump the so-called mixed reviews and go for it!!\n\nand most importantly, wherever you are in this world, spare that one day every 3-5 years to vote in the elections. that is the only democratic tool we have and do not waste the same and keep mocking, memeing about government when you see something bad and do nothing about it. that is the crux of this movie. enna nanba, nanbi- will you vote this time?","label":0},{"review":"just watched sarkar - want to share the experience with everyone spoiler free..\n\n without wasting any time lets get in to the plot  because thats how the movie is. and talking about the plot and story there is nothing new its very well know because of the controversy that the movie faced even before its release. but thats not affecting the movie at all because there are lot of other things in the movie which you can look into. first lets talk about vijay.. omg the 46 year old beast on screen..he is very clear about presenting himself infront of the camera. the way that he behaves ,walk ,smile and his mannerisms looks super cool on the screen and according to me he is very apt for the character that he played the corporate ceo with 99%ego and 1% social cause and he carries the movie in his shoulders completely simply saying perfect match for the word \"simtaangaran\" ..talking about characters we also have to talk about radha ravi and  varalakshmi sarathkumar both played their roles well .we also have to talk about the technical things about the movie..on that note first we have to notice girish gangadharan the cinematographer of the film who did an excellent work and the framing and movements that he handled in stunt sequences was brilliant and the production designin..i bet that except sun pictures no one can made this movie this grand and genuine..hats off to them on that..a.r.rahman usually did his best and delivered what required for the movie...actually i had a dream that \"how it will be?? when arr do music for a commercial telugu movie..\" and this movie gave the answer for that..and also the stunt choreographers ram and laxmam simply awesome..and the next hero of the movie is gonna be jeyamohan the dialogue writer of the movie nailed it and my favourite dialouge in the movie is a dialouge about my hometown rameswaram..\n\nverdict : a well known recipe from the hands of a masterchef..✌✌","label":0},{"review":"sarkar \n\npolitical thrillers are quite interesting to watch when it is customised and tailor-made for a \"larger than life\" hero-vijay. sarkar is an intense political thriller in the recent times which is specially made for vijay to establish his political platform. ar murugadoss should have real guts to adopt this script as the entire film is driven based on the current scenario in tamilnadu politics. surprisingly, it was produced by sun pictures which got a strong political background though they are in the opponent side. the expectations for this film was hyped and skyrocketed even before the release due to the controversy on who owns the rights for the original story. also, there is no strong alternative films  released for this diwali  which will aid this magnum opus to march towards the blockbuster list very easily. thalapathy vijay and ar murugadoss joined again for the third time. both thuppakki and kathi are dominant films in vijay's film career but sarkar will be an important film for his political career. it is quite obvious that vijay was hunting for a political entry in tamilnadu along with rajnikant and kamal and this film will set the right tone for his political hunch. there are numerous scenes where it directly implies the current ruling government. pala karuppaiah and radha ravi plays the cm and deputy cm role in this film which will remind us the current cm and deputy cm of tamilnadu. none of the party members are spared including the legendary sasikala and other big names. infact, the director used very similar names for the characters to add spice to the political meal. there are numerous scenes and dialogues which are so direct against the ruling government in tn. sarkar's teaser and vijay's speech during the audio launch clearly gave a headsup for the audience on the content of the film. though there are wide scope for the twist and turns, ar murugadoss adopted the preachy style of storytelling. hence, vijay talk more in screen than what is expected out of his role. lengthy dialogues and long single take shots come back to back in the second half which will certainly test the patience of the neutral audience. ar murugadoss is quite sharp in delivering the social message with the powerful dialogues but in sarkar it worked out well only in few scenes and it is rather redundant in the second half.though the plot and screenplay are very predictable the director tried his level best to maintain the gripping factor until the interval block. however, in the second half the momentum lost with slow phased screenplay and preachy approach. varalakshmi character is quite interesting to watch her on screen. her encounter with vijay is engaging and helps the audience to connect with the screenplay. unfortunately, she had very little screen space in the second half. may be her role could have introduced much earlier in the first half. keerthy suresh is not required in this film at all. even without her role vijay could have easily handled this film without any lag in the screenplay. radha ravi and pala karuppaiah played their part well as antagonists but varalakshmi steal the show with her attitude. sarkar is purely an 'one man army' show by vijay. we could never imagine any other seasoned actor other than vijay to perform this role more effectively and efficiently. he single handedly carry this film on his shoulders to ensure that his fans are not disappointed at any cost. there are sufficient mass element scenes and stunts for him to cater the needs of his fan base. as usual he gave his best for dance and fight sequence. stunt choreography really worked out well to elevate the mass elements. the dialogue delivery for vijay was intentionally

the vote and to not get money and vote thoughtlessly. apart from this nothing is great! some people say it takes lots of guts to show the current political scenario. actually, it doesn't convey anything properly. simply taking some real time topics and depicting in a movie and trying to make a big turn around in people's thought process is a far low attempt by such a giant who has given ramana / thuppaakki. mixing everything (jallikattu sentiment / using ramanathapuram ( similar to rameswaram - birth place of beloved former president ) / visiting a victim of self immolation act by her father (similar to the protagonist's real life situation of visiting a victim of thoothukudi proceedings), indirectly reminding of the current opposition party personalities ( # 2 character is similar to xxxxxmurugan & welcoming a lady at airport reminiscing xxxxmozhi ) and finally naming that lady character with xxxxvalli similar to former cm real name and making that lady character assassinate her beloved (trying to draw parallel with suspicion behind former cm demise) --- all making it just a medley!\n\nam not sure why the ruling party is so overwhelmed by few scenes!

up by murugadoss to create the picture of bad governance and how one man saves it all. a movie based on one man is saved from monotony by a r murugadoss script and direction. apart from vijay, no male character has any substantial role... radha ravi is under utilised and varalaxmi has a better role than keerthi suresh who seems to be in the movie for songs alone. two songs (simtagaran and omg ponnu) and two fights are thrust upon us like the unavoidable costly popcorn.. and there's no comedy to speak of either.. . and yet like the miracle we had at marina.. the director weaves a plot around real incidents and people.. and takes it from the realm of reality to fantasy.... where every vote is cast and only the deserving win. it is only the clever turns of the plot and a strong performance by vijay that hold the movie together. while it is a praise worthy vision of the future to aspire for, two questions arise, firstly, does the public always need a saviour or is it the demand of this format of storytelling and secondly given that these socioeconomic concerns have been around for a decade, could such a movie  been made 5 years back... under a different production

digest.i have decided to watch films of the likes of vijay sethupathy or vishnu or kathir. no more rajini,vijay, surya or ajith as they have nothing to offer anything artistically enhancing to their

our country.\nthis movie even shows a lot about the tamil nadu government issues and the people of tamil nadu being totally dependent on the parties for various schemes and other things they get from. the government for votes. this clearly shows how people need to change and bring out new faces and why the youth should start playing an important role in the nation building.\n\na major part of the

the people for a better society. \n\nthis is a total thriller, but the 1st  half of the movie is a bit boring . the real movie kicks starts after the intervals. \n\nwatching vijay on the big screen is

look realistic, tried to include 'almost' real incidents in the movie, made sundar pitchai as sundar (vijay), google as gl, and a few more, but the movie looks far from being real. a hero is always supernatural, but trying to change things within 15days seems unbelievable, especially with gaps in the movie as big as a cave for elephants to escape.\nno price for answering this, but here is your question: what's the role of keethi suresh - this is a question that even she can't answer. what's the need to have a herione if she has nothing in that movie. if nayanthara can act without a hero, why can't our heros act without a pair if there is no role for her. may be vijay still lacks the courage to move away from typecast of a duet, fight, ghana and romance.\n\nwith rahman's music also letting us down, we feel rahman was asked to match vijay' s fan base than to stick to rahman's ways. \n\nthough the director has tried to convey a very strong social and national message on the importance of voting, the story lacks the delivery. it somehow misses to grip the audience. and to top it all, it is said  that this was a story taken from a junior director... \n\nif you watch the

i could. the only reason i missed the show was because... i just couldn't get any time! but having watched it today, i feel sarkar is really a class apart action movie. to make a politically charged film within the popcorn entertainer template is no easy job but it's really impressive to see filmmakers like ar murugadoss and many others do this. \n\nvijay is really the star of the film and has sunken his teeth into the character of sundar. after a point of time, i forgot i was watching vijay, the superstar. his performance was so real that i felt i was actually watching sundar ramaswamy who looked like him! be it the action or the dialogue delivery, he doesn't disappoint even a bit. keerthy suresh is quite decent throughout the film. the villains are menacing from time to time due to the tricks they play, so you'll definitely hate them. supporting cast also offers what's needed in this entertainer.\n\ndialogues are a major plus point. the action sequences are a major highlight of the film. each and every fight sequence is impressive and outstanding, mark my word. cinematography is also impressive. music is good but a couple of songs were kinda misplaced. editing is good as the film has almost zero subplots and stays focused. \n\nif you have a disliking for political movies, maybe sarkar can change that since it's a full-on action entertainer. just keep in mind that while that it does have political elements in it, it's actually a story of social reform and the role of public in it, just like kaththi. plus, due to its fresh story and execution, sarkar, in my opinion,

but i felt like something was missing in the end(the climax), i couldn't believe that it is the end. the fights scenes were good. vijay manages to act as a corporate monster well. varalakshmi was good too. but when i compare sarkar with mersal, i think mersal was better in everything. i won't say that sarkar is bad, it is good and you can watch it with your family once.","label":0},{"review":"an out and out #vijay show with lots of fan moments all over. #varu #yogibabu do their part very well despite the limited scope.#radharavi gets to do a full time after ages. #arm recovers from\nhis #spyder disaster and delivers a social message product in his usual commercial style but goes overboard at times. \nlots of real life incidents and characters have been used intelligently. it could have been more impactful had he avoided his cliche scenes.\n\nfor others, definitely a decent one time watch 👍👍👍","label":0},{"review":"it's really superb to see vijay thalapathy in this movie. it's not the first time he acted in like this movie his recent movie mersal also was on bringing awareness to people about medical mafia and how g.s.t is going in wrong way. in this movie is totally concentrated on right to vote and how people are being dragged into political parties startergies and their plots. it's too funny that tn government is negatively reacting towards this not only degrading it. it also setting their party workers on fire, i think it is not good way,the government should appriciate for doing movies like this which brings awareness for people. it's a typical sophisticated movie so all who understands it may not like it because everyone wants truth to be in favour of them but it isn't. i really suggest youth to watch it as they are the people who change the society","label":0},{"review":"sarkar \n\nonly movie for deepawali 😉\nit's basically it's a political. masala movie\n\n*it's a purely vijay'movie \nhe has improved in style and screen presencealso

movie but my son is a crazy fan of mr. vijay.\nmr.murugados is a daring director people should learn to appreciate ..such courage.\nthe combo of a daring director and actor .. accept the fact....nothing wrong in highlighting the truth\nyesterday in a news a lady says mixi and tv is important it was really amazing....that an educated female speaking like  that.... he was right he was highlighting what actually is important she tried to avoid. as he said are they scared of mr. vijay.?\nhe is a sensible person he wont get into politics of course if he has a mind to do gud why not...\nit was disgusting to see the guys with white and white acting so weird. grow up guys. please look at the real problems in your state health issues, education, employment....","label":0},{"review":"watched sarkar today.......\nthe movie has a brilliant message in it....which is delivered sharply to the audience\nvijay’s screen presence is felt strongly throughout the 2hrsm 44 mins....\nfirst half is excellent which makes you want more and more\nthe second half also goes on in a good way but omg penne and keerthy suresh interrupt the flow at certain parts\nunrealisticic fight scenes (especially the last one)\ntop tucker as bgm works perfectly and gets us in the mood..\nvijay rocked with his dancing as usual\noverall a good movie with a good message carried by one man .....ilayathalapathy vijay\nrating: 3/5","label":0},{"review":"so to comment about this movie. this movie basically acts as a propaganda for vijay to enter into politics. he has taken this brand new avatar of defaming political parties, to be more particular (aiadmk) . but vijay you may have created this larger than life image among the masses and people who worship you, but this isn’t the way you get into politics and capture the hearts of people. politics may be your favourite genre in the recent years, such as ( thalaiva ) and political issues taken up in movies like ( mersal ) but damaging a political institution and targeting a particular leader is not funny. as your movie dialogue says “ people who die instantly become martyrs in this society” but that doesn’t mean you can defame the name of a person who is dead. if you are a true man.. you could have done this when jayalalitha was alive.. but you did not have the guts to do so. so i feel you are not manly enough to address issues and this isn’t the appropriate way to enter politics. just because an mgr and jayalalitha became political leaders after being a part of film industry, not everyone can rise and become a leader. it kind of needs some qualities. that’s all i can say. you are not going on the right path. truly irritated by the so called one man army and dialogues which instil puratchi. this movie is completely biased and it only addresses the mistakes and blunders of aiadmk. i feel this movie should be banned.","label":0},{"review":"songs settings are good, loved the

visual treat for vijay fans.\n\nrecent times have seen a rise in the number of political thrillers. sarkar is one such artwork.the movie conveys a strong message which does not fail to reach every single person watching it, especially when conveyed by a mass hero -ilaya thalapathy.. \n\nthe first half is crispy, stylish and totally applaudable. the action sequences, although dramatic, drives the vijay-lover in you crazy. every time he is zoomed in,the crowd goes mad with his style of dialogue delivery. the second half becomes a little more preachy. varalaxmi's strong screen presence and voice is a definite plus. \n\na great applause for the director who has boldly potrayed the current political scenario in the state.\n\nthe least bit of patriotism a citizen can show is to cast a vote....... this is the message which is meticulously conveyed in the film through a hero who can reach the masses with his style and screen presence.","label":0},{"review":"finally sarkar has come to
