[{"review":"amazing and one my favourite movie i have never seen in my life superb movie.  actors acting were too good. the theme was about that sanjay dutt is not a doctor he is trying to act as a feak doctor so that his parents were felling proud about him that his sun is a well known doctor of that place when they knew the reality from boman irani means his characters name was dr j. asthana he was dean of that medical colleg. and last scene it was emotion when they were hugging each other they were crying in real   in sanju movie ranbir kapoor was telling that . director was telling them cut but they were not listening to himmat all . but when in 2006 lage raho munna bhai released when sanjay dutt was talking with jimmy shergal about his father shri sunil dutt ji passes away that he wants to say something to him that night but in next morning he died to cardiac arrest . yes i have still remember in each and every news channels news was spread that famous politician and actor sunil dutt pass away it was in year 2005  in regional channels they were showing gun salute was giving to him and sanjay dutt and his sisters were crying every bollywood stars were present  from starting abhishek bachan , shahrukh khan, salman khan, aamir khan , akshay kumar, pretty zinta ,  javed akhtar etc bollywood stars were present.","label":0},{"review":"this movie is one of its kind. a perfect entertainer. each and every age group will enjoy this movie. have seen sanjay dutt  in a gangster role in many other movies but after vaastav this is my favorite movie of him. each and
