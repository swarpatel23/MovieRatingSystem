[{"review":"(what can i say. when you hear that one of your favourite disney classics is going to be recreated for live action, you also hear that tiny voice of trepidation in your head saying \"please don't mess this up\". well i'm pleased to say that was not the case here. aladdin is a complete triumph.\nlet's  break this down.\n\nwill smith as the genie was always going to be a huge talking point. he had some very large robin williams style shoes to fill. smith admittedly did not want to recreate perfection but instead put his own spin on the character whilst still maintaining the nostalgia of the role. it's fair to say it was a success. there were some classic smith comedy moments throughout as well as his own original musical flare in some of the films most famous numbers. a great job for the hollywood legend.\n\nas for mena massoud (a fairly unknown actor) who played the title character, he was simply perfect for the role. he looked the part, had an excellent singing voice and managed to capture the cheeky charisma of the character brilliantly well. with some excellent dance scenes and some hilarious comedy timing with co star smith, massoud was a truly wonderful casting choice for the film. he really is the real life aladdin. \n\nit wasn't just massoud and smith who stood out either. naomi scott (princess jasmine) and marwan kenzari (jafar) gave an equally believable performance in recreating these characters. naomi's out of this world singing voice was enough to send shivers down your spine whilst the villainous stare and evil tongue of kenzari did not disappoint. a film is only as strong as its actors and everyone in aladdin did a phenomenal job. \n\nthe film itself was very well directed. props to guy ritchie for putting his own personal film style on this without diviating from the well known story line and maintaining the magic of the classic 1992 original.\nvisually spectacular scenes including the memorable flying carpet scene and the cave of wonders greatly exceeded my expectations. this cgi magic mixed with some excellent musical production scenes made this film one i would watch again and again. a classic story exquisitely made with an immensely talented cast. what more could you want from disney. for me, watching this was like watching one of my favourite childhood films come to life.\n5 stars all day long!","label":0},{"review":"directed by guy richie, the same guy who gave us \"snatch\" and \"sherlock holmes \" is here with an arabian fairytale...\"aladdin\" is nothing but a nostalgic dream came true for those who had seen it on tv years ago. we need , perhaps, more movies like this, celebrating love , hope, freedom and the pleasure of being together, victory of truth and the destruction of evil...yeah ! in nutshell, a very happy ending movie. it's the most colourful movie i have seen this year...\nmena massoud, who plays aladdin may not be a guy that you will fall in love at the very first sight, but let me tell you, eventually you start to feel for him, root for the street rat. naomi scott is princess jasmine with all the glory to that name, she plays it convincingly innocent and royally elegant and super stubborn as she sings \"speechless \".\nbut who steals the show here ? none other than the genie, will smith has transformed himself not just in to blue but also as an incredibly funny genie who gets most of the best dialogues of the movie and he simply remains the sole reason why you leave the cinema with a big smile. he sings , dances and cracks jokes ... and you just can't help laughing out loud.\nguy richie extraordinarily recreates the arabian magic on screen... let it be abu, rajah or iago, all of them are carefully crafted, magnificently maintained and brilliantly brought onto the screen. the songs, the set, the colours, clothes, the dance and i may not be able to finish without mentioning jafar played by the very talented marwan kenzari, as an evil touch to the fairytale, is commendable. guy richie has been a brilliant director and he proves it yet again. \ni personally feel we need more movies like this... where goodness is rewarded, evil is expelled and togetherness is worshipped, love is triumphed... with every rub on the lamp, a genie is set out.... with a tale of love ,trust, hope and togetherness. \ni'm going with 4 stars for recreating the magic , for guy richie and will smith.\n⭐⭐⭐⭐","label":0},{"review":"within a duration of about 2 hours, i was able to journey through my childhood days, and enjoy each and every bit of the ''whole new world'' as well. almost three decades have passed in between the old and new film, yet not a single emotion is absent in the new movie. it is as fresh and soothing as the old one. hats off to @guyritchie, the director of the movie, for recreating most of my favourite scenes.\n although a debate about @willsmith as the #genie is on air, smith is too awesome for this role. he has done great justification for the role as well as for the movie. once again, he proved that he can portray any role in any movie as efficiently as one can think of. @menamassoud as aladdin is too adorable. he justified the multifaceted character of #aladdin - a street rat who is forced to earn his living by thieving, a selfless vulnerable guy, a trustworthy friend and a true lover. but what i like mostly about disney is the paradigm shift of its recent movies; a shift in the trend of female characters from dwelling on a bubble of romanticism to strong women who can earn their own positions in the society by themselves and not by the mercy of the patriarchal society. #jasmine of this decade can speak about their own demands. they need no help of any man. they know what they want, and how to get them. jasmine (played by @naomiscott) is perhaps the best role in the movie, and will be remembered by the audience for a long time.\nthe most powerful tool of this movie is its songs. old songs are recreated in a wonderful way, especially ''whole new world''. the new song #speechless is also too good and powerful (i've already listened to all the songs almost a thousand times in a loop since release) \nthe vfx and other technical tidbits are indeed praiseworthy and mind-blowing. \nalmost all scenes are breathtakingly awesome. was there a genie in reality, i would have wished for such wonderful movies from the house of disney in future... \nthanks again to @disney for refreshing our (me and all 90s kids)  childhood memories and gifting us a magic carpet ride, far away from lustreless reality, for full two hours. it's a must watch movie for all 90's kids.","label":0},{"review":"i will attempt to do this without too much bias from my 5-year-old self who fell in love with the 1992 disney classic, \"aladdin.\" i took my girls to see the live-action version today and it did not fail to deliver. without any spoilers, here is what had me leaving the theater feeling like a kid with a dumb smile on my face. jasmine was physically gorgeous and vocally spectacular. i did not know who naomi scott was going into this, but she certainly has my vote for future films. the way she belted \"a whole new world\" and crushed her two new solos restored my faith in modern vocalization. she didn't necessarily sound like every pop-star born out of whatever reality t.v contest happened to be poisoning the nation at the time. her voice seemed more pure, unique, and fresh. and whether or not you're into \"extreme feminism\" or \"women empowerment\" i would say, as a father of two women-in-training, most can agree that she was a breath of fresh air from your typical disney princess without being over the top or anti-man. \nwhile jafar's mannerisms were certainly maniacal and it was clear that he was obsessed with taking the throne, i had a difficult time with his voice. jonathan freeman (1992 jafar) sounded like and delivered his lines in a way you would expect a classic villain. in my opinion, the new voice of jafar left something to be desired. that said, the character overall was decently played and got the job done. \nour main protagonist had the look and moves, but again, it was a voice thing for me. perhaps this is in part to the fact that i had steve from \"full house\" and the singing talents of brad kane stuck in my mind. i understand you are trying to be different than your predecessor, but there were some sung lines that seemed short and cut-off; possibly even hesitant. like jafar, aladdin was mostly positives and certainly held my attention. \non to sets, scenery, and costumes. what can i say? they were absolutely visually stunning! the colors were crisp and vibrant and the set designs gorgeous. the way everything flowed together with such ease made you feel as though you were in agrabah. i imagine the 3-d would have been incredible, as you can clearly see how certain scenes were made specifically for it. \nwell, i suppose that's it. i don't believe i am missing anyone important... just kidding! i had to save the best for last. let's just agree right now that the late, beloved robin williams certainly made the genie, and increased the overall quality of the original classic by about 200%. nobody could ever reprise his role and do it justice. anyone taking on this blue powerhouse would absolutely have to do their own thing, and will smith did not disappoint. with great respect for mr. williams, mr. smith originally declined the role, but i could not be happier that he reconsidered. everyone knows \"big willie\" can drop a beat but the way he rocks the vocals in all of his singing numbers is enough to make the part his. add that to his personal twist on the humor and he is the complete genie package. \nall in all, i would give \"aladdin\" an 8/10. it is a great watch for the whole family as children and adults alike will laugh, dance, and sing along to this modern disney masterpiece.","label":0},{"review":"3.5***  alladin movie review (non-spoiler)\n\nthe same wine in the new bottle with an appealing aroma will be the one-liner. breaking down to the bright side, the 130 minutes of fun and drama is quite engrossing. disney never disappoints and this time, alladin has done decent enough.\n               mena massoud (alladin) the wild card, was the perfect fit and a charming/jolly chap to count upon so as naomi scott (princess jasmine) who was lively and giving to the entire cinema. both of them took us to the typical arabian era and revisiting the sweet teens' love story was a pure fantasizing affair. \n                                                                       will smith's effortless actions were invigorating to the genie character being the big boon and the fluent comic timings are equally perfect as well.\n                            the victory of good over evil, teenage love, dilemmas, exquisite cinematography, revisiting the ancient arabian era and culture are the highlights. much to my surprise like in indian movies, songs pertaining to the plot and situations have been added like decorative icing on a celebration cake. the soundtracks, scores are amazing and have the biggest impact.\n\n                                                  summing up for this arabian knight story is a beautiful presentation with best castings and good music. refreshing movie but little editing could have weeded out the flaws. going out with your girl or family is a good idea. also, watch out for the animals playing some crucial roles much to the credit of the movie.","label":0},{"review":"aladdin was awesome!! 🧞‍♂️ \n(no spoilers review) - listen, i am one of the many who are extremely loyal to the disney renaissance era

precious memories, they become a part of you... \nthe verdict: this👏film👏was👏beautiful 👏 one of the most incredibly gorgeous interpretations to the culture, costumes, and story you could ever hope for. the powerful alan menkin musical numbers were each a home run, they will have you tearing up from the opening \"arabian nights\" through jasmine's new solo song \"speechless\" 💜 the films music stayed true to the format of the originals, but added tasteful elements of new fun in small areas.\nwill smith delivers - he is famous for a specific reason, hes ridiculously talented as a musical artist, and comedic actor.. this should not surprise you honestly. this character is magical... when you stop focusing on how important robin williams was to the genie, you begin to remember how important the entire cast is in the tale of the story you're experiencing. if you really love the original, then you must go see this movie i challenge you not to cry, it's impossible 😊","label":0},{"review":"absolutely stunning cinematography, amazing musical numbers, beautiful vocals and show stopping choreography . i was truly transported to a whole new world and all my

find joy because they simply do not want to, and go watch this stunning retelling of a story we all know and love. the cast did the original justice and i left the cinema feeling magical. (also ignore those who say will smith was a bad choice, because he was brilliant and no other actor could have done such a good job. the whole cast was amazing, when i saw the trailer i wasn't sold on naomi and mena but they won me over and now i've found i firmly believe they were born to play jasmine and aladdin.)\n\ndon't get me started on naomi's beautiful voice, rendered me speechless.\n\noverall it was perfect and will smith truly put his own spin onto the genie while still making us remember and love robin williams. they were both the perfect genie, just different types. the musical scores were amazing and i do not think it could have been remade any better. 5/5 as there was no room for improvement. \n\n(also it's hilarious so if you want a good laugh, go and watch it. )","label":0},{"review":"i enjoyed every single second of the movie. the graphics, the dresses, the colors, the music, the strong nostalgia, the new feminist twist! gosh! what a movie!\njasmine was by far the most amazing disney princesses in live action and even animation. she is elegant, beautiful, royal, kind but stubborn, ambitious and yes, she won't be silenced. that song \"speechless\" the way she delivered it gave me goosebumps. her character was complete within herself. aladdin didn't need to rescue her. they were a perfect duo. needless to say, aladdin was done to a perfection as well. the charm, the dance moves, the singing, the emotions.. all were spot on! just made me feel all kinds of feelings. i was so sad when the movie ended. we need more movies like this. that remind us of beautiful love, friendship, sacrifice, honor, strength and that women desever their own voice.\ngenie was hilarious. to be honest, i missed the original genie a little. but will smith did it his way. and in itself it was amazing. the humour, the facial expressions, the depth of character.\ni am in love with this amazing adaptation of a timeless classic in need of modern flavour! the changes were seemlessly interwoven into the original movie. it was perfect. anyone who tells you otherwise just doesn't have any sense of wonder and nostalgia.","label":0},{"review":"as a huge fan of the origional aladdin i decided to approach this film with an open mind and think of it as a stand alone.\nit felt like it had the structure of the original but bits were taken out improved and put back in again.\ni see this as a good thing and everything a remake should be.\nthe casting choices for genie, aladdin and jasmine were perfect.\nwill smith was perfect as genie and did not feel the need to match robin william's genie as it felt like his own take and i praise his acting.\nalladin showed real fun and you believed every line, he also had an excellent voice and had grat chemistry with neomi and will.\nneomi was a fantastic jasmine and has a beautifull voice, and showed us a jasmine we never got to see before.\nwhen i first saw jafar i had my doubts one included was he oldenough, evil enough however, his performance was sinister and sickening as it should be and he did a great job.\na problem i had was that the film contained a lot of cgi now some cgi can be harmless if used right, i was impressed by the practical effects used for alladin's stunts however i could tell when cgi had been used and it pulled me out of the movie.\nmore songs were added to the film and they made it all the more better, the new songs were taken worked on and made even better than before, a whole new world nearly brought me to tears and i loved it all.","label":0},{"review":"wonderful uplifting movie 🎵🎶  \n\nwill smith is so much fun,  he is a complete joy to watch as genie.\n\nhe brings out his super adorable hip-hop fresh prince persona and melds it with a dash of maturity\n\n . . . honestly you ain't never seen a friend like him !!!\n\nmena massoud and naomi scott are perfect as aladdin and jasmine,  they're a very talented duo.\n\nall the best bits of the animated original are faithfully there . . but they're all enhanced\n\naspects we were not comfortable with are all removed and-or improved.\n\nbetter than the original ?!

atleast make jafar look sinister and or give him some character other than his clothing! this is meant to be a big production and a greatly anticipated one at that! \n\nfirst off i generally never judge a movie on the first watch. why? well becuase i need to watch it several times over a period of time to fully let eveyrhting sink in and so to appreciate the film. i'm sorry, but that's just me. \n\nhowever, i will say a few things based on my first watching of the film.\n\noverall it's a good film. the musical parts in particular are probably the best parts of the film. there's also a song called speechless which is surpisingly good and modern based on the films time period and setting. i kind of guess it might become a hit? you heard it here first if it does!\n\ni still think will smith was wrong to be casted as the genie. don't get me wrong. i think he did a great job if not better than all the other actors but he still wasn't the right actor for the role bo matter how talaned he may be as an actor. his 'fresh prince' 'hip hop' spin on the genie kind of worked but overall robin williams blew the character out of the park with his performance but we all knew this was always going to be one best genie. \n\nno disney live remake has been better than the animated (original) version and this movie is no exception. \n\ni'm still not sure whether it is the best rendition of a live action movie to date but i'm inclined to say yes becuase the story of aladin in my opinion is one of the best and most popluar in the disney catalogue of films. so that's why i think it is probably the best live aciton disney movie to date. (although i reckon the lion king will be considered the best once it is released for the very same reason). you can't beat the circle of life story. it's the best!\n\ni could literally write an essay on this movie however i will keep it breif as this is a google review and i understand people may not have the time and just want a general, condensed idea of the movie. \n\ni also thought guy ritchie was an odd choice to direct this genre of film. the mummy yes, aladin, no! and unfortunately despite it being a good movie i kind of think, imagine what it could have been like if they got a more appropriate director to shoot it!\n\nthe performances weren't the best imo. apart from will smith who if i'm honest isn't in the top echelon of actors (he hasn't even won an oscar) and depsite how funny and entertianing he is he just isn't up there with the industries top teir actors no matter what you may think. princess jasmine acting is probably the worst imo. her expressions were flat but her singing was good (if that was her natural voice which i highly doubt it was. i'm thinking autotune and all sorts of other electronic wizardry) was likely used to improve her voice which actually if your being paid such a large amoutn of money you should be able to sing. i think the actor who played aladin actually did a really good job considering. \n\noverall i would reccomend watching at the cinema (plus the fact i hardly paid anything to go see it) and becuase well, it's aladin!","label":0},{"review":"alright, i was 11 when aladdin came out in '92 and i instantly fell in love with the film and soundtrack 😍👏\n\nnow fast forward to tonight and i've now seen the live adaptation at 38 🤯 i won't lie, i was super skeptical about the film for so many reasons but the main reason was that robin williams could never be replaced as the genie.\n\ni was ready to leave the theater within the first 20 minutes due to the pacing of the film but i knew i couldn't do that without seeing what the always charismatic will smith could possibly do to fill these impossible blue shoes.  \n\ni am so glad that i stayed because as soon as the friend like me song started the movie flipped the nostalgic kid switch in me 😃 it was such an amazing sequence and i knew instantly that will smith was the perfect casting for this role. i'm certain that robin williams would approve of his respectful take 💙\n\nif you have reservations about this film, let them go. i think you'll be pleasantly surprised with what entire cast and crew were able to create. it may not be a whole new world but it's pretty close 😉👍","label":0},{"review":"i can't believe....\n\nit was awesooooommmmmeeeeee\n\nok. don't you dare compare to the original because the story got changed in many many ways and you will see as soon as the movie starts. they didn't change the very core of the story or the lesson that it teaches us by storytelling rather than added more flavor to it. if you're like me and has all the lines memorized ( in english and in your native tongue) you will see the differences, if it has been a while since you watched the oscar winning movie of 1992 you won't notice rather you will enjoy every minute of it.\n\nwill smith made me laugh for some good minutes in there and i don't usually laugh that much that easy in a movie. he kept the funny part of the genie and added a human part of it . literally and you will understand it as you watch the movie.\n\nmena massoud is the perfect aladdin. so charismatic! he is literally the cartoon brought to life. at first i didn't like him but when you hear him singing and going all over agrabah with his street rat jumps, you will fall in love with the character of aladdin more than ever. ( even though the amazing dances and jumps are not his rather they are of nicky andersen who is his dance stunt double and hashani who is his stunt double). when a whole new world comes along you will feel like a child again.\n\nnaomi scott was born to play jasmine. seriously and what a voice! she brought a new side of jasmine to life and made her more independent than ever. her relationship with aladdin is certainly different from the cartoon. but it will charm you in every possible way. and when she dances it just looks so stunning.\n\ndalia adds so much more fun to the story. she is the handmaiden to the princess and every time she showed up i knew it would be entertaining.\n\njafar... gosh i literally felt bad for him when i learned more about his backstory. you can learn so much about jafar if you actually pay attention. he is not just a villain that is hunger for power for literally no reason. he has his reasons .\n\ngosh they even teach you more about jasmine's mother!\n\nabu is still cute and funny. carpet is the same great one that we love. and the sultan is the most different of them all. he is no longer acting like a child rather he is a righteous leader.\n\nit was more than 2 hours but it felt like 30 minutes. it is fast in my opinion. such a diverse cast wow!!!!\n\nand of course alan menken, the best composer of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\ndespite being a musical in a way, guy richie made into a n action movie and you will feel it. it was better than a musical and than an action movie. it's

the acting felt so forced except for will smith. if will smith wasn’t there with his acting kills, i probably would’ve walked out. there were scenes that were such a waste of time s/a the guitar picking jasmine does when she goes to aladdin’s “home”. they added a song for jasmine, an already admirable female character. it feels as if every movie needs to emphasize that woman are allowed to really do whatever they want. yes, i’m a woman and i can gladly say whatever comes to mind. thanks disney. that scene itself was questioning. oh the parade, could disney not afford a better set? the parade was sooooooooo lame. the parades in their amusement parks are more exciting than what ababwa pulled off here. the acting was really, play acting it felt like.... a play. thanks for being someone from snl ya know. sketch comedy but she had some ironic background so why not right? also, there’s the scene where aladdin wasn’t sure genie planned out “gifts” for the sultan to receive but then aladdin knows all of a sudden what all the gifts are?? what? oh and abu as an elephant...... oh my goodness. that looked awful. remeber when aladdin is in the lion cave? yeah, how they’re not suppose to take anything? well, they’re walking on gold... touching it. right? but abu loooks at the red gem and takes it from that monkey statue so that’s what triggers the place to erupt. well in this case, they were touching gold, walking on it. i mean the carpet thouched them too. aladdin steped on a gem and dropped it, causing abu to become intrigued by how pretty it is, picks it up and just stares at it in his hands. sooooo here the cave gets triggered if you stare at something for too long?????? i mean they touched things prior to the red gem? i’m really just listing my criticism now but the actor who played jafar.... i couldn’t believe that was jafar. i wanted a more intimidating jafar. one to make me go “ahhh noooo” but this guy. i really couldn’t take seriously. the line in you’ve never had a friend like me... “our cells need service” i wanted to scream. while watching the movie. i slapped my face many times. honestly when it’s listed as a comedy i’d completely agree. it was a great movie to poke fun of. would watch again.","label":0},{"review":"i grew up with the original animated movie, so i came in with pretty high standards, and came out very impressed. the two

paying tribute to the original in a way that is very entertaining. \"friend like me\" and \"prince ali\" were a lot better than any of the trailers/sneak-peaks made them look.\n\nthat being said, i wasn't incredibly fond of the one new song addition, to be honest, and there were definitely a few changes from the animated film that i wasn't totally sold on. but there were also a number of new moments and changes (the jam/gift scene had me cracking up) that i really enjoyed. no movie is perfect, but this one was definitely one of the good ones and i would recommend that anyone who loved the animated one go and see it!","label":0},{"review":"my husband and i which are will smith’s age liked it . when i saw will smith in posters “blue”, and the silly uproar early on from fan of the

smith is no robbin williams , and to that i say, robbin williams as an animated voice was brilliant and as spastic as ever. however , anyone old enough to remember watching robin williams in the tonight show with johnny carson and jay leno  interviews or other talk shows knows that a little of his brand of “spastic “, comedy goes a long way with many. i don’t think even if alive , would a live -action robin williams’ version would  work well. even the absence of gilbert gottfried as “lago”, the parrot may have been missed by some ( me included, although again too much for the live action version)  , but this gave other characters a chance to be fully developed , especially the main characters . will smith gave us a glimpse of his fresh prince days \n( albeit a bit older /mature version) in his comedy delivery and mannerisms , while not overshadowing the plot . i was dancing out of the theater ( with memories of gettin jiggy wit it on my mind) ... all i needed to hear was will smith and dj khaled and my 14-year daughter was mortified and my husband surprised and pleased by my long forgotten dance moves to hip-hop that made you want to move dance too! will smith had a bit of trouble transitioning to the “normal” acting segments with nasim pedrad (dalia character)   in the film , but it didn’t take away from his performance.  i’m sure this was due in part to all the energetic, emphasis  and focus going to the over the top “genie” character moments , which i feel he nailed. i also thought here we go again with young no-credential actors that will act as forgettable sidekicks to will smith’s character. however, the break out star was mena massoud (aladdin), i want to see more of his acting, when he smiled by 20-year old inner self swooned ( yes i used the word “swooned” first time for everything) i think that everyone played their roles well and not so over the top that you felt like you were watching a stage play.  \n\nwill smith grounded the movie and brought the modern edge /swag to the movie.  oddly enough, i had hoped for more from the character of jafar, played by marwan kenzari. i thought he would be the villain with the dark comedy (forgettable ), i wished the performance was more like jermey irons as scar from the lion king or alan rickman performance as the sheriff from the 1991 movie robinhood:prince of theives. i think perhaps in addition to a possible a mis-cast, he maybe too young too play the part and bring the complexity that was needed to make him stand out. he may have just misunderstood that playing the villain didn’t have to be delivered as deranged -petulant child. however, it was nasim pedrad (dalia/handmaiden), who i kept watching ,her comedy was a great bridge between the characters. naomi scott (princess jasmine) was engaging when playing off of or performing with mena massoud. navid negahban (the sultan) performance brought the levity to the film that helped make it more cinematic and less children night -time story. overall good performance by all.","label":0},{"review":"when going into this movie don't think of it as the animated classic or the broadway musical version in a separate way. think of it as a merge of the two with a modern splash to top it off. \n\ni found the music to be a wonderful blend of classic broadway hit and modern beat. smith's rendition of genie is a wonderful mix of his own personality and the character as well as giving a honorable bow to william's classic character. \n\nthe new small twists they have regarding characters ambitions, & past bring out a more well rounded idea of the characters and how/ they act the way they do. jasmine isn't just looking for a husband to become sultan, she wants to be sultan. jafar isn't just the royal adviser, he was once a thief that climbed the social ladder. and genie, has dreams of not only being just free, but human. seeing these key things help you see the world from their eyes, why they do certain things and their process.\n\ni felt this was a good start to what the live-action movies should be. beauty and beast was one of my favorites when it came out as i felt it blew the prior jungle book and cinderella out of the park.however aladdin has shown me what these movies are actually doing to the franchises, which is opening the animations and musicals to more details about the world that was already set. they are expanding our childhood movies in a way that we now can relate on am ore deeper level.\n\nit's not that cinderella just lost her father, they show us  how she lost her father and the impact it had on her and why cinderella was so kind.\n\nwe understand why belle's father kept her in that small town that called her foolish and odd. we truly saw how horrible the prince was before the spell was cast.\n\nwe now know why jafar was how he was, we see that jasmine had a big impact on her people and show the ambition.\n\nour small golden paged books are being expanded into a large novel now, just like all our lives have since the first time we saw the flms.","label":0},{"review":"rating : ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ /5.\n\nwhere to begin really? if you have not liked the animated version and that's why you're planning not to go to watch it, you're making a big mistake buddy!! i never quite liked the animated version in comparison to the other animated movies but i decided to give the major motion pictures version, a go. (with guy ritchie as the director) and now here i am getting all babblesome about how wonderful the movie was. i had watched the major motion pictures of 'cinderella' and 'beauty and the beast' before this one. and my personal favourite is beauty and the beast. but i'll have to tell you, now that i have watched this movie, i can bet the dislikers would too go crazy over the brilliant visual effects. according to me, this is the best disney has created so far.\n\nso now the performances are as follows. will smith was in his element. with all the swag of the cool genie and the heart of a compassionate friend, he was the best actor ever chosen to have played such a diverse role. he proved aladdin could never have a friend like him. mind you this man is extra talented with his raps and songs. ;)\n\nmena was the chocolate-boy-happened-to-be-a-thief but he played aladdin as the boy with a golden heart. the audience would not be able to resist his dimpled smile and raw wit. and would awe at his velvet smooth working of hands on stealing anything swiftly.\n\nnaomi was all gracious and lovely. her acting was fantastic. but i would have chosen a lady with a better arabian english accent in this context. her voice in her songs would give you goosebumps. and this movie showed a side of how women should be educated and well taught to be independent and voice their opinions. a freshly feminist one at that. \n\nmarwan was really the best who could ever play jafar. evil and hauntingly alluring at the same time. \n\nyou would love the great songs, although majority would go to see the song 'a whole new world', which was as dreamy as dreams could get. i was literally bursting my lungs in the halls, belting it out, when it played. you would not hate this one i'm sure. go for it :).","label":0},{"review":"considering the badly edited trailer, movie was a pleasant surprise... can't say it was extraordinary but it was able to bring back those sweet childhood memories of watching the cartoon... naomi was tailor made for jashmine's  role & with her awesome singing & dancing skills she had done justice to the role with all the grace of a princess...a special mention to song speechless that left me with goosebumps.. as for aladdin, mena had his hits & misses, there were sm really good moments & in some cases we involuntarily compare him to the animated character & feel his energy is not up to the mark & same goes with his singing prowess...now coming to the places were there is huge gap between the animated characters & the real ones.. for starters genie maybe they could've chosen an alternate genie with better comic timing & singing skills than smith...jim carrey or hugh jackman for instance....lago the talking parrot- voice over was nothing worth comparing to the original..jafar was less of a villain & more of a comedian trying to pull some tricks... even the ultan's character lacked that orginal silliness & joyful laugh... anyway it was worth watching...","label":0},{"review":"magical, entertaining and fun! mena massoud who played aladdin and will smith who acted as genie were the character themselves coming alive. knowing that abu is not real, mena created a very believable interaction and made abu come alive as its own character. this is no easy acting feat and i appreciate mena for bringing his own aladdin as a selfless, kind, determined and positive person with good intention. at the end of the movie, you really root for aladdin. at the same time, will smith would have made robin william proud with his musical rendition and great acting as genie. he bring a lot of soul to the movie too and he is a scene stealer in the scene of welcoming prince ali into the agrabah. \n\nin regards to the singing, mena, naomi and will smith can sing so well that i enjoyed the film all the more. some of the audiences were really humming to the song \"whole new world\" scene and the magic carpet scene is really wonderful. \n\n*i was so relieved that it was not a boring repeat of emma watson and dan stevens (zero chemistry) performance & the horrible \"out of tune\" singing from beauty and the beast. aladdin was 10 times better.\n\ni applaud guy ritchie attempt to inject some dance scenes with bollywood meet hip hop fusion. it was very entertaining. i felt transported to the world of aladdin with all the beautiful choreography and it is so timely. the graphic effect of magic carpet deserve an oscar nomination too!\n\nthe only letdown is jaafar and iago. jaafar is very iconic as he has a comedic villain quality that endear many fans and iago is our beloved \"over the top\" and easily irritable parrot. i am not sure why the director and film editor downplay the actor and voice character  in the films. i was so looking forward to the villains but the villains is so tame that i think hamid (head general) would have been better off as the aggressive villain. \n\nall in all, it was a great film to be enjoyed with family and friends on the weekend. i give this film a 4 stars out of 5 stars.","label":0},{"review":"the story of alladin, the street urchin is one of the most fascinating story from arabian nights. this is also the most liked by the children and elders the world over and filmed in almost all the languages of the world. there is no surprise when disney preferred to remake it to the modern times and taste.\nand how and what disney has done is the beauty. the fantasy has been shot as a musical by guy ritchie, the director in a more enjoyable way. the presence of will smith as genie enhances the expectations and a guarantee for a lively movie. our expectations are not shattered and what you see is a wonderful, fantastic, fabulous journey into the world of magic, graphics, fun and fascination.children and adults are seen glued to the magic adventure of alladin (mena massoud), princess jasmine (naomi scott) and their escapades from evil minded jafar(marwan kenzari) with the help of genie (will smith, beautiful portrayal) and assisted by princess' maid dalia (nasim pedrad).\ntechnically too the film is excellent.\na must film to enjoy with family. take them on 3-d adventure,  it will be more fun!","label":0},{"review":"y’all crazy. this movie was dry and every character, even down to jasmines father and that creepy portrayal of iago (jafars bird sidekick) were stripped of their original humor, wit, sarcasm and goofiness. i’m not shocked by will smith’s genie, it’s will smith so of course it’s more street. but the other characters personalities were rung dry. even the villains were stiff! jafar didn’t even get a real chance to show off his sorcerer skills after being empowered by the genie. he lacked the creepy voice and arrogance he had in the original. mainly, iago, my favorite character besides abu of course, he was a total let down. iago was funny, mischievous, not all serving to jafar and mostly a sarcastic smart ass in the original. yet, in this movie he was like jafars right hand that led him in the right direction and didn’t take direction from jafar as he did in the original. and what the hell happened to the crackers!? the funniest thing was how much iago hated the crackers, “polly want a cracker”, from the sultan. the hate he had for those crackers and the sultan were hilarious! especially when he got the chance to feed those crackers to the sultan will always be funny. the let down this movie gave is heartbreaking. kids who watch it and never seen the original can’t even fall in love with the animal sidekicks (also supporting characters like the goofy father) because they were muted. this was saddening. smh\n\njasmine was annoying in this remake. she lacked the allure of the original jasmine and she was too “i am woman, hear me roar”. the original jasmine was strong and confident enough that a “i will not be speechless” was not required. her original character gave off vibes of strength and independence but yet still showing that she didn’t have full control of her life. this one was too much! and what happened to her flirtiness and seduction? what happened to her kiss to distract jafar? it’s like they chose to portray her as more of a feminist due to the current climate and not allow her to be a real woman who would woo you with her beauty and wit but also use it to help fight the battle. a woman that can be strong, speak her mind and still feminine seductress is much more empowering. \n\naladdin was just missing his energy and humor. he was muted to allow the genie to shine. what a mistake cuz aladdin is a smooth criminal (not in the bad sense) who also has a big heart. but the movie didn’t catch that at all. he was cute though! just a different guy. \n\nconsidering all the amazing fantasy and sci-fi movies that are being made you would think an original such as aladdin would get to keep its authentic magic. they could have remade this movie a live action replica, i would have preferred that. the original storyline and characters were perfect. “live action” just means replacing animation with real people and or animals for portrayal. doesn’t mean it has to fit into the realm of reality.","label":0},{"review":"i'm going into this movie without having watched the original 1992 animation (which i made a point to watch after this) and hey, i loved it! it felt like a magical experience the whole time, the music, the occasional jokes and non cliche approach to the story was a great change of pace for me from the usual humdrum movies being spit out today without too much of a thought being given.\n\nmake no mistake, it is a musical, with what are essentially modernized versions of the old songs, and of course, the special effects would have required a lot of money to match the craziness and spectacle of the original. so i would definitely excuse the quantity of spectacle, which isn't to say there wasn't any. \n\nwill smith made a fantastic effort at putting his own spin on the genie. the special effects, of course, helped quite a bit with his jokes, but he did a great job as well.\n\nhighly recommended to take your kids with you for this movie. they'll have

remake of the original movie altering my own perception of the film and its characters. so i had high expectations. unfortunately this movie didn’t meet my own expectations for the following reasons:\n\n1. a very small part of the art was ‘arabian’ that it looked like we were watching a turkish soap opera with an ottoman setting. agraba looked like istanbul and the wardrobe for the main characters looked like they were in the ottoman court, very little to do with arabian culture.\n\n2. naomi scott who plays jasmine is gorgeous, okay, but a bad actress. she is better off as a stage actress or in soap operas. \n\n3. will smith’s attempt to bring out his fresh prince act was too limited by his genie cgi. he was funny and there were scenes that were hilarious but you can’t help but notice that he could’ve done better. \n\n4. the actor who played jafar was the wrong choice. he is a good actor with intense psychotic features, but he completely ripped jafar off of his class and elegance...and his voice!! ugh! he sounded like a sis. oh and no he doesn’t turn into a giant snake in the final battle. instead, his staff almost comes to life as an extension of his rage during that final dialogue between him and aladdin, which is.....justifiable i guess. he was also way too serious throughout the movie. the real jafar has a sense of humor. \n\n5. bollywood! there were so many moments in the movie where you can tell that the production wasn’t creative enough to avoid making the dance scenes like they were right out of a bollywood movie. \n\nthere are a lot of great things about the movie like the a friend like me scene. it was dazzling to watch. the music was modified to sound more middle eastern. know that will smith is not robin williams, that means that he isn’t better or worse than robin williams, he is his own thing, so be prepared to accept what he had to offer the genie. i’d give it a 7/10.","label":0},{"review":"the movie is a dream come true for the 9os

throughout much of the movie. (at one point i caught the case of the giggles and laughed for three minutes straight.) you know that the movie is good when most of the audience remain seated until the end credits have finished rolling.  let me first confess,  i have never seen the 1992 version of aladdin.  therefore, my review is based in no way on comparing the 2019 version with the 1992 version.  as it should be.  each movie should be based on what it delivers.  and boy did this one deliver.\n\nit’s a stunning movie.  each scene could be a beautiful painting.   mena massoud, although not in possession of the strongest singing voice, has the acting chops to make you understand why a princess would want to rewrite the laws of her kingdom so that she can marry a “street rat.”  he delivered in every scene and is the major reason i caught the three-minute case of the giggles.\n\nnaomi scott was up for the job of playing princess jasmine.  yes, she is beautiful and her father is the head of the kingdom, but this jasmine is not your ole fashioned princess.  she is not waiting on a husband to make her a queen.  she wants to rule.  and rule the screen she does.  naomi bought jasmine to life with perfection. \n\ni’ve read complaints that marwan kenzari's jafar is not menacing enough.  again for me, for this aladdin, his portrayal of jafar was perfect. perfectly corrupted by the thirst for power.  i enjoyed his performance so much that i just finishing searching for other projects that he’s been in.   \n\naladdin is a true ensemble cast movie, however, will smith’s genie is the star of aladdin.  his genie will take you on a magic carpet ride range of emotions.  bravo, mr. smith, bravo.\n\nafter first enjoying aladdin in an imax theater, i will be going again to see it in 2d.  my rating:  4.5 out of 5 stars.","label":0},{"review":"finally saw the movie and will smith did an amazing job (i was silently praying like please will do good please please please) lol and he really did and def kept me laughing...the movie was great and very magical def brought me back to my childhood. a perfect movie for the whole family. i will always love robin williams he played a big part of my childhood but i honestly feel robin would've been proud of will's performance. i loved the colorful gowns and clothing that really  portrayed the culture and the amazing cgi graphics. everything was perfectly put together for this remake with both familiar songs from the original movie that had a slight playful twist and also new songs featured in the movie. overall a must see/ must purchase for the disney remake's collection.","label":0},{"review":"growing up at home in the 90s with two younger siblings, disney had it’s spot on the top of the mountain as far as animated features went. and it’s ambassador at the top of that mountain. “aladdin”.\n\nneedless to say our whole family wanted it done well. we wanted a strong cast, loyalty to the material and music, as well a performance that did justice to one of robin williams’ most iconic performances.\n\ni can tell you that i was satisfied.\n\nthe live action remake of aladdin is strong. not perfect, but it’s worthy of it’s animated counterpart that was a part of so many families that are looking to past the story on to the next generation.\n\nthe story stars mena massoud as the title character, and naomi scott as jasmine. the casting of disney princesses will always come under scrutiny (see emma watson in the beauty and the beast remake) but scott takes charge of the role with a powerful voice that really shines during the musical numbers. it’s not a stretch to say it’s her film.\n\nnow we have to talk about the genie.\n\nwill smith had the impossible task of following the late, great, robin williams’ animated genie that remains to this day, one of the finest voice performances in history.\n\ndirector guy ritchie was right to let smith make the role his own, while staying loyal to the original. his vocal aren’t quite the same on songs like “friend like me” and “prince ali” but they “get over the net”\n\nthe special effects are first class disney. characters like abu the monkey, iago the parrot, and the magic carpet are wonderful and while the appearance of the genie itself hasn’t flown well with everyone, it’s hard to imagine how they could have done it differently in a fashion that would have remained original.\n\nall in all, ritchie’s “aladdin” is fine. capturing the magic of disney animated classics is not an easy filmmaking feat but this is a carpet ride worth taking.\n\ngrade: b","label":0},{"review":"what a spectacular!

he put his own little pizzazz into the original genie (but of course it was great.) mena massoud was the best though, as he was the main character. mena (aladdin) did great at his part and i believed that he really was a “street rat.” the music really blew me away! all the songs had different beats and if you listen to just the audio, it doesn’t really sound as good alone vs with the movie. princess jasmine was amazing too. she was very pretty and a great singer. speechless (her song) is my friends favorite song now because of the movie. the only flaw i caught was the jafar didn’t really look like jafar at all. that’s the only flaw i caught. 9.5/10! i would definitely recommend this to others.","label":0},{"review":"this movie is really prime 90s nostalgia. if you were a fan of the original, this is a must see. they did change a couple pieces of the storyline but i think it improved the characters and explanations overall. i wasn’t mad about any of the changes unlike how i’ve been for some of the other live action disney movies. i might actually like the way that they wrote some of these characters more than i liked the originals—especially jasmine. as for the songs, jasmine and aladdin’s songs were perfectly acceptable—i wouldn’t say better than the original, but fine. jasmine’s solo song was a standout and i think that was a good addition. they had good voices and i think were good choices for the roles. now—to will smith’s performance—it was just different than the original. they focused much less on the voice acting/different voices for the genie, which robin williams excelled at, and made the genie a little more serious and hip hop. the songs lacked some of the pizzazz and humor of the original as a result—especially “friend like me”. some portions were even entirely changed to get away from the different voices/accents that robin williams could do and opted for just different dialogue in those sections that catered to will smith. i personally much prefer robin williams’ portrayal if i had to pick, but i see why they went the route they did. they’d rather do something different than repeat robin william’s performance (and probably not do it as well anyway). will smith still did a pretty good job, it wasn’t horrible, and the genie managed to have a cool/dry humor about him. overall, i’d go see this again and i definitely think it’s worth a trip to the movie theater. if nothing else, it’s a visually stunning movie that brings you back to your childhood and finds a way to make you want to sing along.","label":0},{"review":"as a 90's baby born in 1992. with the lion king, aladdin, beauty and the beast and pochahontos being my favorites when i was younger and a disney college program alumni i have been quite impressed with all of the live-action movies. honestly you can't compare these to the animated movie as it brings a whole new way of magic. i have a 3 year that i get to share my childhood with. it makes seeing these movies even more magical. as some see genie as never being replaced, i agree but i also agree that will smith brought his special version of genie to light. i think the cast did a great job and i  can't say anything bad about it. i truly enjoyed it! 😊 definitely worth seeing and props to the director and actors for bringing the animated version to live-action.","label":0},{"review":"100000/10 ! this is definitely my new favorite movie . i loved it so much i went to watch it again and can’t wait for it to go on dvd . \nmena (aladdin)\nhe was the perfect fit for aladdin and his chemistry with jasmine is amazing . he sounds literally like aladdin . \nnaomi (jasmine)\nshe definitely brought that wow factor to the screen and the movie itself . her voice is amazing ! speechless is my new favorite song now lol. she was amazing and i guarantee she’ll be big after this.\nwill (genie)\ni really can’t say anything about will because the way he portrayed genie was spectacular ! robin would be very proud.\nand as for the others that played a role they were just a well fabulous. dalia definitely fitted right in. she was hilarious and her and will brought the comedy into the movie besides mena with the jams .😂","label":0},{"review":"i want to start by saying that will smith did an admirable job stepping into a role that was designed for the late robin williams. the scripted jokes were delivered well, but weren't a match for genie's previously ad-libbed charm.\n\nhowever, i did not agree with the changes to princess jasmine's character or that of the villain jafar. princess jasmine in the animated version never wanted to be sutlan, she simply wanted to marry someone who loved her for being herself and not be bought like some trinket. the new song given to her character has a great message for anyone who feels like their voice is being drowned out, however i didn't think it was necessary. as for jafar, nothing against the actor, i don't know if it was the script or the direction he was given, but i wouldn't have let him in the front door of my home, let alone make him second in command of agrabah. the animated villain was charming and manipulative, he could talk his way in and out of any situation.  the live action jafar was very aggressive and angry all of the time, which made it hard to believe he was 2nd only to sultan. \n\non a positive note i did feel that the movie did justice to abu and carpet's characters. i also liked the personality tweaks the made to the sultan. \n\nall in all the movie was only passably good for me, but it wasn't great like i have come to expect disney movies to be.","label":0},{"review":"ok, i like many of you will and always will hold the original robin william's version in high regard, who wouldn't it was a masterpiece in every sense. however\n\nfast forward to now and a new live action version (like jungle book, beauty and the beast before it ) has hit the cinema, and so i went with a few reservations as to what this will be like, will the new genie in will smith be any good, the guy from lock stock and sherlock holmes directing, and i'm extremely  happy to report and say they were mistaken.\n\nthe whole movie was a utter delight, the songs i thought were slightly better than the original especially friend like me and prince ali were breath taking.  the pacing was fast after a slow 20 minutes or so, the comedy just right, special effects breath taking, hell the whole movie was awesome.\n\ni've even gone as far as to say i have pre ordered the blue ray today fir my daughter so go see it, it's amazing","label":0},{"review":"aladdin\ndisney's animated movie\n\nstar..3.5💫\nlove story of aladdin and jasmin\n\nit is very nicely dubbed in hindi, abu🐒 and jinn catch your attensions and give sweet laughing punches. i always have been used to watch aladdin series at 4 pm daily after coming back from school, this was my favourite cartoon series.   movie emphasizes on love story of the charming street rat aladdin and the courageous and self determined princess jasmine, that disappointed me. final touch was superb where we could feel 3d effect effectively and finishes movie with victory of  good over evil. voice of salman, shahrukh, nasuruddin was used to give tadka. one time watch watch😎\n\nfilm critics...satish tiwari😎","label":0}]
