[{"review":"hello (telugu): punchy, impactful and soul stirring. breaking my inhibited approach to regional cinema, 2018 kickstarted with this refreshingly entertaining telugu film. hello is a beautiful medley of a traditional love story woven into a modern outlook carefully presented with sensitive acting, crisp dialogues and astute direction. akhil akkineni (son of actors nagarjuna and amala) is a fresh breath of air telugu cinema has ever witnessed. his second film as the lead, akhil is a fine combination of good looks and intelligent acting reflecting his legendary lineage. \n\nthe storyline, despite being cliched, does not bear the brunt of deja vu as it has been treated with finesse by a talented team of writer-director (vikram k kumar) and actors akhil akkineni, kalyani priyadarshan, ramya krishnan and jagapati babu. akhil (srinu) is a street boy who befriends this girl (kalyani priyadarshan) at a gol gappa stall in his childhood. they bond well and she encourages him to play an original score on his ek tara. but destiny has other plans and the girl leaves the city for good. in the meantime, akhil too meets his foster parents in ramya krishnan and jagapati babu and his life changes forever. however, 14 years later, both resolve to find each other come what may. \n\ninterspersed with nail-biting chases, fights and ‘’happy’’ coincidences a la salman khan style, the film engages you till the end.  the background score by anup rubens is noteworthy and adds to excitement of each chase. a far cry from the usual fare hello is embellished beautifully with fine performances by all supported ably with a tight script. ramya krishnan is the heartstealer with sophisticated yet subtle acting as the doting mother. her poignant scene where she is overjoyed to hear her foster son call her amma yet doesn’t want to make a big deal in front of him is touching. hello is regional and yet global in its approach. reflecting the changing tastes of audiences. watch the film and you will say hello to only entertainment all the way till the end.","label":0},{"review":"hello (telugu): punchy, impactful and soul stirring. breaking my inhibited

his role. his screen presence, agility in the stunts and all his hard work is clearly visible on the screen.\n\nkalyani priyadarshan makes a decent debut and is a perfect fit for her role. acting wise, she has done a decent job and will surely go a long way. credit should go to vikram kumar for nicely adding an action backdrop to the love story. all the stunts showcased are top class and bring a lot of depth to the story.\n\nramya krishna and jagapathi babu are top notch as akhil’s parents. especially, ramya krishna, she does a superb job in her role. all the emotions showcased between the family work well for the film. the film looks quite rich as the production values of the film are very good.","label":0},{"review":"1st half is bad.2nd half okay.unneccesary stunts replicating a monkey jumping from one branch to other branch of a tree.i think it should be avoided .vikram k kumar mixed so many previous hit movies and gave it as a new product like atlee kumar from kollywood.for example the story reminded of \"kushi\" and venkatesh starrer \"vasantham\"(i'm talking about the violin sequences).\n\nakhil showcased his monkey skills.forced stunt sequences.,,,,\nkalyani did her part okay.\nramya and babu are good.\nkrishudu did his part good.\najay as comedy villain did his job good.\n\nso many logic mistakes in the movie.\noveral the movie is a one time watch if don't regret after wasting 2.40 hrs time.","label":0},{"review":"a boy and a girl from different backgrounds fall in love regardless of their upbringing - and then tragedy strikes. it's sweet, tragic, intense, and very modern too. i loved it and if you like sad romantic dramas you will love it too. i especially loved akil role and priya in this movie. akhil looks more confident in hello compared to his debut. the dances are still in the hyper zone, but slightly relaxed. the screenplay is designed to suit the strengths of akhil, highlighting action and dances with light-hearted romance and family bonding.","label":0},{"review":"guru's complete honest review:\nonly for youth and newly married couples.\nall other category will get bored like hell.\nfrom youth perspective excellent emotional

incredibly, excellent acting.\nvery very weak story.\nexcellent bgm and songs by anup 5/5 for him.\nexcellent screenplay by vikram k kumar which keeps the film alive.\nunnecessary fights but excellent stunts and taking of fights which is some entertainment in film.\ndescent comedy.\ngood acting by jagapathi and ramya krishna but overacting.\n2.5/5 for movie.","label":0},{"review":"amazing just
