[{"review":"a film that made me go on. one of the finest film of 2012. barfi, a story of a speechless and deaf boy (ranbir kapoor), who fall in love with a girl (illeana d'cruz) who refused to marry him because of his family pressure. in addition to this, story of a autistic girl named jilmil (priyanka chopra) also goes as her grandfather signed her will in her name. barfi falls for jilmil but in trouble when her old love comes calling.\n movie exceptionally drove you into the world of barfi and jilmil. the best thing about the movie is ranbir  kapoor and priyanka chopra. their acting skills and emotions made you a beliefs that both are the finest actors of bollywood. illeana d'cruz also shines but her grace is outshine by our desi girl priyanka chopra. beautiful location of kolkata and direction of anurag bash made a film evergreen. it requires a watch.\ni will rate **** stars\nand rotten tomatoes i will rate 96%","label":0},{"review":"one of the finest creation of bollywood. filled with all emotions  altogether decorated by exuberant performance of ranbir, priyanka. well supported by ileana and class acting of saurabh shukla. beautiful location of darjeeling brings freshness. \nin the end message i got from this lovely movie \" you need not have perfect partner for perfect love story ...two imperfect souls (by social paradigm) can complete each other, can be perfect for each other, can have soulful love story.\" \nkudos anurag basu.\nphir le aaya dil majboor kya kije...\nraas na aaya rehna dur kya kije......","label":0},{"review":"this is probably the best bollywood movie of all time.\nwithin the first 120 seconds of the movie you already know whats the film about.\nwithin 16.18 minutes you know almost everything about ranbir kapoor(barfi) like his weakness,strength,characteristics and his aim(to find a trust worthy partner).\nand  then before 23 minutes you also get to know why ranbir and d'cruz(shrusti) love each other.\nits just brilliant and a s grade movie","label":0},{"review":"never watched a movie from bollywood before but this movie was do beautiful i had to come a leave a review. this has become one of my favorite films. i could even say it better than dome movies in hollywood. priyanka chopras performance is outstanding . one of the movies i will always remember it plays in the back of my head constantly.","label":0},{"review":"ranbir sir is best his acting is awesome. his one of the most loved and greatest movies are ae dil hai mushkil, barfi, tamasha, now sanju, yeh jawaani hai deewani. i

as emotional at the same time . priyanka chopra's acting must have been awarded. ranbir kapoor , my fav actor again showed his class and after nearly 8 years of this film , i find it equally interesting .","label":0},{"review":"i like the movie, of course..priyanka chopra is the best..others are also terrific..but i am upset for ranbir who shamelessly copied charlie chaplin and buster keaton, two famous actors of silent film era. the director should acknowledge formally at the opening of the film, that he copied some of the comic situations from silent film actors (which includes  so recent rowan atkinson..!).there are so much likeness and similarity between his movie and some hollywood films. so inspite of being beautiful and classy, barfi falls into the category of parody or spoof of old foreign movies. we should remember that bengali filmmakers like satyajit ray and mrinal sen, had made oscar level films..but never copied hollywood..!","label":0},{"review":"ranbir is my all time favourite actor he always comes with a unique character and play it very generously. in this movie i love the character of jhilmil  (priyanka). preety, heart touching movie, with great moral.
