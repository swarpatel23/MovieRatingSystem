[{"review":"its one of the best movies to hav come out from bollywood n my most favourite till date ... amazing n excellent performance by salman khan which we dont often see.... its salmans best performance after tere naam...he has outstanding  screen presence in the movie ......akshay kumar has also played his part well.. music is awesome one cant believe that its an anu malik album....lots of similarities one can see with the legend ar rahman ....but anu malik has won the audiences with the songs..specially ajnabi shehar n humko maaloom n sau dard these three r the best in the albums....great direction by first timer shirish kunder ....n sajid nadiadwala is the best producer one can have ....its a big budget film from #nge films.....a great musical treat for a family...*****star .","label":0},{"review":"i really love the movie, that remember  me those memories when l had seen sit together with my loveable sonia. we had really got emotional when we had seen
