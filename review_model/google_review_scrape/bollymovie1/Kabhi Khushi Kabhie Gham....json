there . you should always your parents and you should respect them. don't respect them that they are providing you luxury benefits because they are earning money for your happiness so that you don't have too suffer from proverty . you don't have to do hardwork like them. actors acting were  very good. songs were very good specially that one bol choriyan bol kangna . its18 years old movie. still i don't get bored while watching at this movie .","label":0},{"review":"their are some movies, which how many times u ever watch, never get old. always give u the good vibes. and to say, this film

family....","label":0},{"review":"really good movie. and as we all know king of romance srk is here. so romance will easily happen. this is a good movie but the film was quite long 2 hours 45 min

comedy is mind blowing.","label":0},{"review":"kabhi khushi kabhi gham is one of the most accomplishments of karan johar . he deftly handles all the comic scenes in general and emotional scenes in particular. the scene where shahrukh took the decision to marry kajol, first encounter between shahrukh and hrithik is astounding. the epitome of emotion is displ in last conclusive climax which is heart -moving. amitabh sir sparkles in the scene . all the casts delivered their respective parts well. again towering performance of amitabh sir and hrithik .","label":0},{"review":"really missing
