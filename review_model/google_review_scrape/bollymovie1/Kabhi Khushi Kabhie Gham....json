there . you should always your parents and you should respect them. don't respect them that they are providing you luxury benefits because they are earning money for your happiness so that you don't have too suffer from proverty . you don't have to do hardwork like them. actors acting were  very good. songs were very good specially that one bol choriyan bol kangna . its18 years old movie. still i don't get bored while watching at this movie .","label":0},{"review":"their are some movies, which how many times u ever watch, never get old. always give u the good vibes. and to say, this film surely does top the list. hands down to this one. always touches ur heart whenever you have a watch. i guess there's no other film better than this one which teaches u about the value of family....","label":0},{"review":"really good movie. and as we all know king of romance srk is here. so romance will easily happen. this is a good movie but the film was quite long 2 hours 45 min approximately. all the songs are really very good. and the dance in kehdo na u r my soniya was just seperb which was presented by hrithik and kareena","label":0},{"review":"really awsm. i i watched this movie so many times and by watching this movie i also enjoyed a lot. really fantastic movie . this movie makes me so much laugh. i really appreciate kajol and karenna performance in this movie.

me.","label":0},{"review":"currently still watching this in 2019, this shows how amazing this movie is. everyone is great, the songs are lit and i am gonna say this movie is the last real bollywood movie. right now all the movies only are hits because of the exposure and nudity.\n\nall srk fans must watch thisssssssss","label":0},{"review":"superb film. i loved it. sharukhan  plays his character lovely. kajol is very nice in humour sense. especially hrithik and kareena is very charming and so good looking. they played their role very well. hrithik roshan dance is as usually good. sentiment, comedy is mind blowing.","label":0},{"review":"kabhi khushi kabhi gham is one of the most accomplishments of karan johar . he deftly handles all the comic scenes in general and emotional scenes in particular. the scene where shahrukh took the decision to marry kajol, first encounter between shahrukh and hrithik is astounding. the epitome of emotion is displ in last conclusive climax which is heart -moving. amitabh sir sparkles in the scene . all the casts delivered their respective parts well. again towering performance of amitabh sir and hrithik .","label":0},{"review":"really missing this kind of movies now. strengh of family bonding especially mother and son...  great story and direction...  mr. kj,,,  please do these kind movies....  i like all the performances especially

cast. from legends like amitabh and jaya buchchan, to mega stars like shahrukh khan, hritik roshan, kajol, kareena kapoor, and rani mukherjee it just too good. and all the hype surrounding it. plus the music was another great factor. title track, bole chudiyan and suraj hua. thanks.","label":0},{"review":"a family movie like this was never made and can never be made! every scene in which srk is featured is worth to shed a tear drop! class and splendid performances by all the actors. the confrontation between srk-amitabh in the end is the best scene ever and even now when i watch that scene,  i cannot control my emotions!","label":0},{"review":"this movie spoilt me gave me wrong picture of london😂. i went for holiday there booked an apartment at mayfair (paid a heavy duty price) thinking
