It goes as far as to keep the details of the last fight of the film the very same. One might think the writers of Brothers weren't very creative when it came to plagiarising smartly. \n \nThe characters are the typical overly-used archetypes. If you've watched a few Hollywood mixed martial art movies, you will tire at the unoriginality of this film. \n\nThe fight scenes do not add up for the most part. Protagonists survive the worst of blows without almost any consequences while the opposition, despite obvious strength and weight superiority find themselves struggling helplessly by the end of all fights. \n\nAlso due to it's commercial-bollywood nature, the film overly invests in emotional dilemmas even when it is, arguably, completely unnecessary.\n \nIn conclusion, it is produced by Karan Johar.","label":0},{"review":"BROTHERS\n(sport/drama)\nToo much drama in a sport movie, they just kept on stretching the scenes which were unnecessary. Actually there was only one scene which will give u the motivation,the adrenaline rush you expect from a fight movie. They could have gone Easy on the emotional part of the movie.\nThe cast has done wonders in making this movie good.\nOverall above average.\nMy rating 3","label":0},{"review":"It's a very good movie.

Especially if you have seen Warrior before or if you are a fan of Mixed Martial Arts or movies about MMA. The fight scenes are garbage and the acting is pretty bad too. The editing is also really choppy. Watch Warrior. Thats a movie and a half.","label":0},{"review":"It was the best movie of my life it was kind of emotional at the end because of Monty who is siddharth I wanted him to win I was supporting him but he lost but Monty who is siddharth is stronger then david unreal life as well","label":0},{"review":"This  movie are awesome because in this movie show to learn  today generation don't fight your brother for property and and other reason if u r younger then care your smaller brother and you r smaller then respect  your elder brother in any reason and condition.","label":0},{"review":"Well it involves a great deal of emotion in this film..No matter how tough can u be there is always a soft spot in anyone.","label":0},{"review":"Some people may not like this movie as much as warrior but both the movies are equally good you cannot expect Hollywood level in Bollywood but this movie has surely increased the level of acting.","label":0},{"review":"Directed did what fewer he could , but what can you do more with a copied ( Warrior)plot , nothing  , not even 1% of original \"Warrior\" , that's why bollywood stinks ,can't they come up with original concept,rather than copied plot ..Shameful .","label":0},{"review":"Some people don't like it cz the original was better but take it as a Bollywood movie and u started realised it's a perfect motivational masterpiece movie üôè","label":0},{"review":"A very good movie. I am quite surprised that it flopped at the box office. Garbage movies like Race 3 do 150 crore business and movies like brother flop. Seriously??????????????????","label":0},{"review":"The only reason this movie is praised is because it's bollywood's version of a movie called 'warrior'. If you were to compare the two, this does everything worse than its english counterpart, which is very disappointing.","label":0},{"review":"Absolutely terrific movie edge of your seat kind of movie, really enjoyed it, love, emotion, drama.
