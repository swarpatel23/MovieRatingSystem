It reminds me how I completed my engineering and handled my love life simultaneously. And yes there were fights in my clg life. I acted like a hero. Movie had such impact on me. But seriously at some point of my clg life, I got treated as a college star.\nIts been 6 years now that I passed out from my clg. My college is still using my pictures in the brochure and advertisement and on display boards.\nRecently went for my college alumni meet. Current students recognised me as the college advertisement guy. That nostalgia was like whole RHTDM was going through my mind. Met my ex there. Recalled what we had. Things aren't like what u wish for. I was trying to recall how she looked 6 years ago. Now she's a mother. She became a woman now. Spending time with her made me go through my whole college life all over again. This reunion thing is quite emotional. Friends, teachers, Old places, classes made me feel like Maddy again. I was again a hero. I again acted like Maddy without regret. This time i collected all those in my pictures‚ù§Ô∏è","label":0},{"review":"It was the Day of 19 October,  a cyclone of love came in Bollywood named RHTDM.
