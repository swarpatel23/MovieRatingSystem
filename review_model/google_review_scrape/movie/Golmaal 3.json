[{"review":"It was just an amazing movie. I just could not stop my tears while laughing out loud. As moments pass the comedies of the movie heightens its levels.The sweet and sour relationship of the orphans just like brothers brought wide smile on my face.The story is fantastic and from small children to the senior citizens can watch it sitting together. So what are you waiting for guys? Go and watch this wonderful movie.","label":0},{"review":"One of the best Comedy movies ever made.
