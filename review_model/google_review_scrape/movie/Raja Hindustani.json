It goes beyond imagine. Love doesn't see status. When why who which How where are impossible to determine. Very smooth quite normal instinctive. \n           Dr Dharmesh Darshan did well.Aamir khan is gorgeous handsome around the world,n't probably but must count as best goodlooking man in the earth.In Raja Hindustani he acted smartly, touched perfectly to the character of a taxi driver,  straight forward, sensitive lovely appeared. Both fell in love each other and discovered or found  love between self and opposite partner Inspite of being parental opposition she got married and barriers came in their way. Misunderstanding led them to be detached each other.In party Raja got offenses due to intensely created confusion arranged by relatives Arti behaved badly with Raja in the party inspite of knowing Raja's honesty she couldn't manage Raja well and shorttempered on Raja.Raja hurted by her deeply and stepped away. \nUltimately Arti repented and Raja forgave, his mind set turned towards wife for his kind hearted nature. Indian woman culture strictly showed in this movie that a woman never wants to break up the relation with her mind-God by any means of.By hook or by crook  she wants to protect  and develop the  life of her closest partner.In this circumstances how she can demand divorce separation ; out of imagine.Marries happens  once in life fixedly .THE FIRM RELATION.   But in our country, real fact is well-known. Mutually understandings is very essential now a days in married life atleast. It was all time block buster.I think Aamir khan acting in this film is fabulous powerful full of passion oriented minute touch  well done. \n   A coincidental happened once without any plan during watching in 2018  on small screen. A scene Arti begging her  husband's long life before lucky mirror on karwachowth.Just at same time my mom suddenly came and looked her face before mirror on karwachowth;   Cleary we (me and daad) could observe having sat at a side to the mirror. We delighted.  Exactly \"mirror watching\" from two sided at just same moment and on obviously on same auspicious day karwachowth. My mom also was celebrated karwachowth on that day interestingly.  Unexpected gift presented to us .All God's wish.\n   Watched it 17 times till the date. All songs are superb,sweet Especially  as a bathroom singer I've been singing kitna pyara. Pucho zara  .Aaye ho .\n\nMeanwhile connecting with this romantic picture is mandatory for all film lovers.watch and enjoy Life is Love,enjoy it with peace in a short term human life span.\nNamaste to all readers heartly .Good luck. ðŸ–’","label":0},{"review":"This is a my fav. romantic movie.\nThis movie to connect my childhood drama i m sharing now\nWhen i was saw this movie with my parent in the theater so i did't understand what was happend surround to me  bcoz i was only 2 year old.\nBut now i was know through my parents u sung a song pardesi pardesi movie of raja hindustani 2 to 5 year.\nBut i don't remember bcoz i was childhood when i was 9 year old in 2002 i was saw the movie 4 to 5 time regularly.
