But with Kabir Khan it is not same, even his perfect method films aren‚Äôt really those typical ones you see every other day.\n\n‚ÄúBajrangi Bhaijaan‚Äù, this year‚Äôs big Eid release, is a perfect emotional movie and makes for a perfect viewing. A god-fearing, Hanuman worshiping earnest Bajrangi who thinks even eating meat is a sin and entering mosque is taboo. The child actor Harshali Malhotra plays a mute six-year-old Pakistani citizen who accidentally strays into India and it‚Äôs her character that brings out the best from Salman Khan or Pavan as he is addressed in the movie. Lost, hungry and lonely, Munni aka Shahida sticks to Pavan and unable to shake her off, Pavan takes her home not knowing anything about her. The mute one communicates all her feelings through her poignant eyes.\n\nTheir bond is charming and their chemistry is mind-blowing. The innocent face of Harshali and vibrant expressions while leading him to India are some of the best moments of the movie.\n\nAs the movie progresses and Pavan starts looking for her parents and while he greets the crowd with Adaab instead of Jai Shri Rama while entering the Indian soil towards the end of movie, each of the moment are soul-touching. There are few moments where the peace angle is shown, the romance between Pavan and her school teacher Rasika. But the movie mostly focuses on the relationship between Pavan and the mute child Munni. You can sit back and let the plot take you for a ride into an area in world whose existence Indians don‚Äôt even acknowledge, POK. As Om Puri, playing a wise ‚Äòmaulana‚Äô in the film, tells the hero: ‚Äòthoda sa Kashmir hamaare paas bhi hai‚Äô.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui as the Pakistani TV scribe nearly steals the show with his story on the little girl lost in border. Flashes of Gaddar shows when Bajrangi decides to unite Munni with her parents across the border. This was highlighted much before the release of the movie. There is nothing really in the first half, the film starts in the second half when the character enters across the border. At 2 hours and 20 odd minutes, the picture is cool and entertaining. Climax is a bit stretched but the reasoning is logical and go with the flow. The movie has heart, its winsome, the picturesque scene based on POK are way too good.","label":0},{"review":"Amazing movie. Storyline direction was real good of this movie.
