[{"review":"I love this movie and acting done by shilpa and her parents. The story line is great and the movie has love, friendship and family drama. This is all time favorite one and love the songs which are really soothing ones. I like akshay kumar as actor and in this story he started his marriage with friendship and then it took some time to go to other level which is love. I recommend and rate it 4/5.","label":0},{"review":"Wonderful Film It has so many emotions and traditional values which lack in today's society. I think today's society should learn from the film. Songs are great I like Nadeem-Shravan for their music. So many memories of past come to my mind when I listen to the songs. Waiting for a fully traditional and good sequel with music by Nadeem-Shravan.","label":0},{"review":"This movie has been delight 2 watch for everyone..
