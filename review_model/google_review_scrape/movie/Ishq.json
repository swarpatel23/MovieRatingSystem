All this happen, notwithstanding so many (unenforceable) laws  that are intended to secure and  protect a woman's modesty and citizens fundamental rights in general.\n\nA natural fall out of lawlessness in any democracy is the prevalence of one  unwritten \"law\" : \"Might is right!\"  Women and those men who keenly fight for their well being, safety or modesty (their male friends, husband, brothers, father amongst others) jointly and equally  bear and share the brunt of such systemic tyranny. \n\nIn my humble view, Ishq is not really about toxic masculinity or  about how men are raised and how they see the world, and manner in which men need to see themselves in order to presumably survive as men.\n\n Ishq transposed me to those terrible times and similar situations in my life that are all too familiar;  where I was forced to  believe that there is no right move, and consequences are severely onerous; akin to a rigged contest where in the words of Abba, \"the winner takes it all , and the loser stands to fall.\"\n\nThe characters in Ishq are  good-natured lovers with a clear thought and intent to marry in the near future and how they become a prey to the worst kind of moral policing by pervs.\n\nThis is not one of those typical Indian films  that begin with a woman's sexual assault and end with a man's satisfying thirst for revenge.  Here, both parties equally suffer (in their own way). What is the  kind of justice you can seek against rogues (these days)  where there is total  lawlessness?? .At no point did I feel  this style of pursuit  of justice to be a typical instance   of \"two wrongs making a right\".\n\nA man's  pursuit of  justice in present times, can be misconstrued easily by women who tend to operate well in the grey and are ready and willing to compromise under the popular adage \"be ready to lose a battle to win a war\". \n\nIn my view, Men need to get it into their thicker skulls that liberated woman hardly belong to anyone much less any man? They can sleep well even if compromised pictures depicting them are freely circulating in social media.Thankfully, the female in Ishq promptly reveals her true liberated nature.  The writing on the wall is clear. Don't try too hard to secure or protect  your woman's chastity. To the women who don't care  about  men who worry for them and  try and fend and protect them. Don't worry! Those days are getting over.   For those over liberated  women who couldn't care on which side of whose bed they wake up each day -  Stay blessed üôè and  count your blessings.","label":0},{"review":"Anuraj Manohar's brilliant direction leads from the front in this romantic thriller.1st half was added just to make people calm and get ready for the gripping thriller to come.\nAfter  Sachi(Shane)  and Vasu(Ann Sheetal) were caught by Alwin(Shine Tom Chacko), Director builds up issues, characters appearing and disappearing.

Shane and newcomer Ann has shined like shining star and every other cast also fits right into the narrative. The movie is thrilling and captivating with moral policing which is a common ground in Kerala. Shine Tom Chacko in negative character makes you loathe him and gives you chill through your spine which is through his brilliant portrayal. The first half showcases how moral policing happens and a couply suffers through it whereas second half without any much of heroism Shane Nigam brings in the revenge factor. By far the filmography of Shane goes, it is his best film till date. The story could have lacked lusture but the director has brilliantly captured this movie into celluloid which is quite realistic in today's world. The climax yet again justifies everything and is brilliant. Only suggestion, I would have for the girls out there in those situation is be bold and fight them. For the sake of movie, it was important to show the character the way it is shown but many a times woman get scared and timid in those situations and you can't complaint. It doesn't overdo in any angle and that's the brilliance of director and scriptwriter. Rightly tagline said, it is not a love story it is a story to be told and effectively communicated. Try it out and you would surely love it.üòçüòç #pranureviews","label":0},{"review":"The script has FLAWS at many levels and affects the minds of the future generation NEGATIVELY\n\n1.

LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LAW: Boy & Girl caught by Police/Local for sitting in the car and almost kissing and threatened to be arrested.  Section 294 under IPC, one can be arrested for kissing if they make a scene that makes people around uncomfortable. Not for a romantic gesture in the back of a car in a parking lot. Each and every child of our society must be taught to inform the police or call for help or dial emergency in such situations and not worry about \"Honour\"\n\n2. BASIC HUMAN RIGHT VIOLATION: A police/local questions two adults of what they were doing in the car when it is none of their business moreover asking questions that makes accusations\n\n3. FEAR & MISCONCEPT ABOUT SOCIETY: It creates fear in minds of girls and women that one should not be in a car with a friend in the dark. And teaches the boys and men that girls who do that are prostitutes.\n\n4. SUPPRESSION OF WOMEN: The female role does nothing but sit quietly and cry. She could have gotten out of the car a million times and walked. But ofcourse she thinks if she does, she'd be raped. Either by the police/local or by others because she's out in the 'dark'. A woman should be taught to respond, act (atleast she did at the end of the movie, thankyou for that scene) spontaneously. \n\n5. MEN+NIGHT=RAPE: The fraud police threatens the hero that the Bengalis walking towards them will rape the girl if he makes any noise. It creates a concept that men are wolves waiting for a rabbit to fall into the woods. Also insults people from other states of India (I'm sure a Malayalee wouldn't take that insult). The men could have protected the girl if he had made noise. We should be taught to trust the people around us not fear them. \n\n6. OBVIOUS CLIMAX: After the behaviour of the hero from 5 min before the interval until the end, one should have guessed by now that a lead female should never a maniac who doesn't understand woman, gets easily emasculated and takes a revenge by traumatizing an innocent woman and child. I felt bad when the theatre filled with applaud to the hero's savage revenge.\nIt would have been a suspense if the woman had said yes to his proposal. \n\nPOSITIVES:\n1. BRILLIANT direction\n2. Cinematography üëå\n3. Excellent acting by each and every actor\n\nIt was an absolute torture overall.","label":0},{"review":"I just loved this movie... u may feel a lil lag but its worth watching..
