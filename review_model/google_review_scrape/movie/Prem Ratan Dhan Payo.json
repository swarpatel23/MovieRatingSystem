[{"review":"Awesome family movie about a Royal Family. Great dialogues and dramatic acting\n\nAll characters are shown with an equal opportunity. The story plot was great and a must watch for drama-lovers or families. \n\nHas some really enjoying songs, light comedy and a wide-ranging plot characters. The Royality is shown perfectly. And the real twist comes with the double role of Salman and the villain's conspiracy.\n\nBut finally, everything goes fine and a very Happy Ending.\n\nThanks","label":0},{"review":"This time Sooraj Barjatya disappointed us. Though it's a family type movie,but screenplay being slow and repetitive same BGM also killed the enjoyment of the movie. Songs were good and looked colourful. Salman Khan did his role perfectly and his dialogue delivery specially in emotional scenes were good. In every scene director tried to make us emotional but as an audience we fail to connect with the story. Armaan Kohli deserved more screen time. Ratings:5/10 stars.","label":0},{"review":"Best family movie I have ever seen. Too much emotional ,touchy and romantic movie. Along with it the actors also played a good job to make this movie look real. Best acting by Salman Khan, Sonam Kapoor and Anupam Kher. The background music throughout the movie is also very touchy which made me cry at many instants.","label":0},{"review":"A poorly adapted remake of Tapan Sinha's  1961 Bengali classic 'Jhinder Bandi' (The Prisoner of Jhind). The original cast had legendary actors like Uttam Kumar and Soumitra Chatterjee. If u are a bong and have not watched it, do it today. The screenplay is awesome and depiction of the character's contemplation is so well portrayed. 'PRDP' with its silliness and hideous acting just could not do justice to this classic.","label":0},{"review":"Best family movie i have ever watched.

The film is based on kings and queens and how they live their life. \n\nThe film makes me sad when Salman khan , the elder brother fight with the younger brother. \n\nIn the movie , Sonam kapoor acts wonderfully in the character . she has enjoyed , lived and portrayed the audience.","label":0},{"review":"I really luved it.I cried even my dad too at the scene wen her sis comes for the property papers n that scene is really touching the heart of mine .n the actors also did a gud job in that movie.","label":0},{"review":"PRDP is a perfect example of films which shouldn't be released on big festivals like Diwali.

Only for die-hard Bhai fans.","label":0},{"review":"Best family movie ever and great music which makes u feel it.Movie has emotions , romance ,comedy,action and most important salman khan & suraj barjatiya combo.Must see PRDP.","label":0},{"review":"I think that this movie was amazing.
