I think sid is right in his own way ; he loved truly without self .Although society may oppose. He has no any harm thought. Love is not sin atall with no bar of age status caste religion complex language regionality natlity high low level. Love creates from deep heart and soul only.But his shorttemper nature broke connection with Akash.Actually he wrongly took Akash joke. Akash had no idea of love , he is pure. \nSameer : the peculiar fickle mind  turned 2 a real lover & also gave good msg 2 youth.\nAkash Casanova is my fvt character.  Bcoz he realized enchanted discovered  love theme ...THE TRUE LOVE.  They had good friendship  eachother.   This film can be watched many times anywhere  anytime..masterpiece  of  farhan. Personally I watched 16 times only till today.Aamir as akash fantastic look dacing getup .my heart cryed having watched his emotional look.l m glad as he choosed Akash role instead of sid role .l found this more interesting than other  two. Farhan idea proved as wrong.\nMusical track thrilled me.. good narration . Akash proposed dramatically. So excitement. One thing if matter is all abt propose so quickly perform it at right time. Never delay....  Nt mainstream movie  still an iconic 4ever.  The moment  sid lost her lady love and all frs became very sad ..very sensitive moment . Age no matter but sincerity impt...Nice movie ..Love is sensitive emotional natural part of life . Any way though  pvt still  TRUE LOVE  mandatory.   I learnt  many voluable  things  from it .  I must Watch it many times  .  Plz regularly  touch with this outstanding movie  ..Each time after watching  dch I found myself very stressfree relaxed tensionfree bindas. I think this is the real charm effect of Dch.That's why I can watch it 10k times without feel boaring.make ur friendship special with Dch plz guys!! Preity is so cute bubbly.Aamirkhan and  akshye khanna  both r very goodlooking charming and dynamic personality...\nTake care . Good luck 2 all viewers . Shanti shanti shanti. NAMASTE.

This coming of age, mature friendship story became so legendary that they came up with another one with the same concept: ZNMD! That too was very good, but to me DCH is the clear winner here. Nowadays, I have no idea why farhan akhtar goes more with acting and keeps himself from being such an awesome director!","label":0},{"review":"Definitely any1 can go 4r d movie.

The intense -packed comedy scenes, flamboyant acting and Farhan's splendid direction has marked an astounding milestone to Bollywood back in the 2000s with this movie. With an eclectic mix of romance and post-adolescence plot along with the character's wittingly hilarious postures, this blockbuster coming-of-age drama will never fail to hold your horses once you get on to watch it. Simply one of the best family-enterntainers of all time.","label":0},{"review":"My all time favorite movie, I have visited all the locations of Goa which were shot in this movie. In 2001 we seven friends planned Goa trip after watching this movie. All the songs were played on auto reverse cassette player non stop in my friends Esteem car.Way ahead of its time, the cast, direction and on set recording of dialouges, no dubbing I think, make it class apart.
