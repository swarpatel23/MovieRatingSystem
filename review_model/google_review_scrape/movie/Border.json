Below are the questions that trouble me and I feel the answers aswell indeed are correct to my opine.\n\nI feel, this movie should not be watched as a relaxation of 3 long hours and then forget the emotions that aroused while watching.\n\nInstead feel the pain, emotions, eagerness for the families of Army personnel who are awaiting with tonnes of hope for their safe return from unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThis movie is a Great Welcome opportunity to Individuals as well the Government to Eradicate unemployment to a Maximum extent.\n\nFor Individuals, who say they are not getting enough job for their talent or Salary not satisfying their present employment then at least support the Nation in any Cadre instead of being idle and atleast with this you'll stop giving idiotic comments..which are truly not worthy..because you do not know the pain the Army men and their suffering families.\n\nFor the Government, when the Government has a capability to grab the land and pay compensation, then why not the Government can't go ahead and take one child from family On Demand and pass the Ordinance as such to join ARMY based on their Qualifications and Capabilities...irrespective of the parents capability whether Minister, Business man, etc.. as every individual who born as human being possess knowledge in some nor the other activities and Everyone who born have to face death one day. Isn't it???\n\nCorrect me if you think that I am wrong in my statements.","label":0},{"review":"Border is one of the best action war film in indian film industry.
