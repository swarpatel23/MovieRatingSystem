The esteemed director, Luv Ranjan makes you think about the gender dynamics in Indian society. Ofcourse, men are naive and gullible creatures easily duped by scheming women.

They also always want a beautiful and hot girl for them that time love doesnt matter.. When they can be so selfish and self centered.. Girls are exaggeratedly showed wrong way..

There's a saying, \"Woman can get laid anyone they want, Man will get laid whom they want.\" That's how our society is. All are thinking that this is a male dominant but the reality is women are dominating not openly though but with mental and emotional.
