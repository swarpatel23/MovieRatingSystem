Azhar is a complete misfiled. It neither captures the spirit of the game nor the personality. A 2/5 for the film!","label":0},{"review":"Worst direction! I have seen in my entire life.

Even with a story as good as this, the movie fails to make a positive impact and you come out of the theater feeling sorry for yourself. This is why you should chose a movie based on its 'director'.","label":0},{"review":"One of the best movie. Far better than useless Dhoni Movie.\nImran is really hardworking and under rated.
