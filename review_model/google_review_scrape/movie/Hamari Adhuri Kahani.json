The premise where a handsome rich hotelier Aarav ( Emran Hashmi) falls for a poor hotel employee is surprisingly convincing. Their journey from knowing each other to being lovers is well explored and their emotional scenes carry depth. I particularly liked the part where Vasudha is beginning to notice the feelings of Aarav which makes both of them conscious of each others presence. These scenes are emoted so well through their tensed body language. I was most impressed with Emran Hashmi‚Äôs performance as he looked and played the part perfectly. The longing he feels for Vasudha is projected with utmost sincerity and the pain he feels after losing her feels almost real and heartbreaking. Vidya Balan looked pretty but other than that she was just another Tulsi, or Parvati right from an Ekta Kapoor show overtly obsessed with her mangalsutra and speaks dialogues straight from 1980ies movies. I was disappointed seeing her like this. Rajkummar Rao was disappointing too with grey hair and beard without a single wrinkle on the face. He played an obsessed husband who is willing to get hanged only to teach his wife a lesson or visit his doctor regularly for 20 years hallucinating his wife. This would be his worst performance and is totally worth forgetting. There are other cringeworthy scenes too which make you feel if it really is a tv soap like when the ACP himself comes to Emran to help him get his love back, or when only Emran could go to the forest alone to get the statement of the padre or when everytime he gets the fragrance of those special flowers he follows them everywhere blindly, or when he dies the flame of the oil lamp goes off but if you ignore these parts the movie strikes a chord with you. With most movies showing love superficially this one makes it look real and beautiful. I watched it in 2019 thinking its a very old movie but when i checked it was a 2015 movie from Mahesh Bhatt camp, i am still recovering from the shock. If it was an old movie from 90ies it surely would have been a blockbuster, but its still likeable. The music is very melodious and makes emotional scenes even more impactful. \nIt‚Äôs surely a one time watch. I seriously have  to watch other Emran Hashmi films after this as he surprised me with his performance in this one.","label":0},{"review":"Years long I missed this movie going with negative reviews it surrounded itself but I am glad today I watched it and felt it to be exhilarating and moving...

In a travelling bus or plane, when there is no known good movies, and with unexpectedly click this movie, then its good. Those who don't think their spouse's are slave and those who believes men and women both are equal, can understand this movie's direction. One of the best of Bhatt saheb  piece of work.\nI rate this 3.5 out of 5.\nEveryone  has their rights to express their views.\nIn Indian culture with mental block of male dominance this might not be suitable to some or larger portion of the audience.\nNeed to understand that like everything  stories  also evolve over the course of time. Definition also evolving  about love and feelings and acceptance of love.","label":0},{"review":"This movie is about purest  true and unconditional love story which everyone won't understand.
