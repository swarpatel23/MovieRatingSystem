It was just weird because he reminded me of Chuck Norris for some reason. The accent was a bit over but I didn't mind it on the whole. You don't go into a zombie flick expecting behtareen cinema.","label":0},{"review":"It's far better than big budget comedy films and moreover film story and script writing was the top notch, n specially kunal khemu  comic timing was hilarious he is superb don't why people don't cast him anymore n saif was outstanding in his russian big muscle guy, overall movie is fab n still it's worth watching n hope they will make a sequel of it","label":0},{"review":"Rating:7/10\n\nLet me get straight to the story .Story sucks and kind of messy. But the comical relief and rom-com kind of scenerios really made me laugh. \n\nPros\n\nComedy, Action,Acting\n\nCons\n\nStory is rather loosely bounded,often depicts typical Bollywood movies saying\"protagonists won't die no matter what!\".\nIn some parts the story seemed itself flawed.","label":0},{"review":"I'm gonna say only this much.\nIf you didn't watch this movie you loose the best horror comedy of Bollywood.\nStop wasting time and go watch it now.\nLoved it .
