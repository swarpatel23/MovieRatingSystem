Nice romance by Aamir kajol and kunal kohli .Good script fantastic narration portrayed. Full drama .Bole to zaakas. \n           Thnx to Aamirkhan sir for choosing  wonderful fanaa. Watched 28 times till .cryed a lot .very pathetic climax . How could zoonie kill her love ???  Let's back to plot --- Rehan had true love for for zooni and son Rehan . He fell in love with zooni naturally  inspite of   effort more to avoid. Atfirst he couldn't convince properly  Jooni abt his mission,  fickle character  (little more)  taster of love  for  hurried and confuse  bcoz he knew already that  the field  in which he  had stepped  that's not a straight path never. His weakness  towards zoonni crossed  all barriers  obstacles. So it's called Love doesn't  obey anything. He became the Ghulam ( slave)   of her beautiness  , simple heart.In another side  zunni smoothly fell to him;  mainly she enchanted  by his sense of humour  sweet mindblowing word,  harmonies of touch and obviously  that happened 1st in her life  which was dream  ( shehzada)since before youth period .Ammi was a big pursuader   means she was concerned abt  beti's future. \n    Zuni and Abba jaan  were very fond of  nation,  quite patriotic. That's why  finally  Zonni had to opt better  one from  2  different right issues  and she lost her lover  forever,  not from the buttom of heart. Still Jooni  has had great love  2 him  till breathe. In here some audiences  may  make argue  -  zuni is  right in her way  than Rehan. But my opinion is   Rehan is so right  than zunni. Zoni couldn't  realize  Rehan's convincing word for past deeds and she misunderstood  & shot him having thought  of they must kill  our nation  like terrors attack  ( nuclear bomb  or missile  through trigger)   other side Rehan had strong  trusts upon self,  he had deep concern  regarding  wife and son,  \"by the help  of trigger  they can demand  freedom of Kashmir  to both Govts  and ultimately 'd get  success  with  nonviolence easily  otherwise they must kill  all of us  including beloved  wife son  \" \n   Proved that a nation lover vs lady lover.  Sacrificed  / destroyed  in love  with a blind girl;  who found  a new life  by him,  lastly could Fire  /kill  by two beautiful  Rehan-giften... on which  blessings put touch having prayed  and further once  who had known \"Discoverer'll turn into  destroyed\" .Let it, organ only...     \n      Afterall,  Entertaining Love story,  beautiful shayari,  marvellous acting by sensitive kajol  and cinematic God  Aamir sir,  fantastic background  score- music  especially chand sifarish,  mere haath,  destroyed in, dekhonaa. One song  I listened on open roof  having wet  with heavy rain  storm  for 1st time  , that's  Dekho naa only .... I liked the script  very much heartily.   Nice story telling capability  .wow!!! We hope more Bollywood films'll come  like this outstanding.  Hope, rating 10  out of 10 .\n  So friends   each bf/gf should watch  it having keen  ,should fascinate by this  magnificent storyline,  should fall in love  with \"fanaa\" . Truely  I must name  my daughter  as fanaa. Supernatural passion of acting,  dedication, zill  to give  100p.c justice  to imaginary role  ; all of those proved by AAMIR KHAN'S JOB AS REHAN. Deep respect to Mr dependable Aamirkhan sir.  Director kunal  performed well as matured.  Well support by risi tabbu kiron kher jee and  the lovable  child star. \n   Bekhudi ki zindagi... hum jeeya nahin karte...jaan dushron pe.... just finished  before 11 minutes.
