[{"review":"This movie is intense. \n\nIt's not for everybody.\n\nWhether it comes to love, passion or pain, everything is shown in the most raw form possible. It's beautiful and heartbreaking at once.\nThe chemistry between Ram & Leela is charged. Their eyes speak when words don't. \n\nThere's nothing that I don't love about this film. Except the end, it was tragic.\n\nThat said, this will always be my favorite bollywood film.","label":0},{"review":"Love it! All the things that I expect from a Bollywood movie.

The only difference is the leading characters- Ram Rajari (Ranvir Singh) and Leela Sanera (Deepika Padukone) have stronger and bolder approaches. The romance is not on trust love, it is all sex. The climax leaves you feeling guilty, it is so touchy, that you be like, \"Nahi! Nahi! Maro mat. Rajari aur Sanera Ek ho gaye!\" But you know- a William Shakespeare tragedy IS a Classic.","label":0},{"review":"Actually when I saw the kiss scene I completely lost my consciousness because I hadn't seen that kind of scene in my life.
