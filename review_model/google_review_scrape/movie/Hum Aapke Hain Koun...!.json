The expose of Aloknath and reality of Salman Khan are two main factors to see it as an analogy of differences in entertainment to real world. Though Aloknath's character was attempted to portray as Sanskary AF, he was an absolute cringe to watch in scene where he admits his attraction towards his nephew's mother in law. Its terrible to look it from the spectrum of his real life events.","label":0},{"review":"I love this movie a lot, and i watch it whenever it comes on television, may be because of Salman khan and Madhuri dixit as a couple in the movie. I love the story line , because its rajshri films production.During the wedding functions madhuri and salman start liking each other,and finally get married.Madhuri is looking so gorgeous in the movie and i specially like the role of Aloknath in the movie.I have watched it more than 10 times.","label":0},{"review":"The first film of 100 crore club...
