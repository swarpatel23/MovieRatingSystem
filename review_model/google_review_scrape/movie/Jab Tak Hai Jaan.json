Some other movies of Shahrukh like Darr again partially relates to my life.\nAny way this is one of the blockbuster movie of the shahrukh and superb  performance by both stars.Everyone must watch this movie at least once to know the real definition of love.","label":0},{"review":"A timeless saga, with explosive performances (literally bhai.. lol), the poetry is sublime and I like to think of it as the icing on the cake. It's my favourite film all three leading thespians. The music elegantly poised reminiscent of yesteryear whilst maintaining a modern vibe. 3 hours isn't enough  please make a part 2. I have no idea what it would be about!! One can always have dreams, Hope's and aspirations.. Thanks for the ups and downs guys..","label":0},{"review":"What did i just watch !?

This triangle lovestory is not an usual love story. This film will make you fall in love in *love*again. Every single dialogue will touch your heart. The best thing is there is no single intimacy scene in this movie beacuse who needs it when SRK can just do with his eyes. The whole story is based on 'BELIEF'. Belief in yourself, belief in your partner, and belief in your GOD. Your belief  can either make you or break you. If you have not watched this film yet my only advice will be just download amazon prime video and watch.","label":0},{"review":"12-year-old me at the time found this film to be ok.\nWhen I reached SRK‚Äôs character and Katrina‚Äôs ‚Äùlip lock‚Äù before Saans intro I was completely disappointed with how little acting was put in the cup tossing before diving into the kiss. It high key took away from the scene. However, I truly believe Katrina Kaif looked unbelievably breathtaking in JTHJ. Let's give credit to those behind her wardrobe, hair( electric leaf blower) &‚Äômakeup. Most importantly, her parents for producing such talent.","label":0},{"review":"I love this movie it is so full of yummy treats SRK as always phenomenal never fails to deliver a stunning performance.
