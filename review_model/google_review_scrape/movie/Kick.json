But you would still get a headache if you want to know the How's and Why's. A script I believe was written when you lack ideas but had vivid imagination.

But hey, it's a Salman Khan movie. So Salman has to get maximum screen-time. The people who clapped after watching that cycle scene infront of the train should definitely stick to Bollywood. As Hollywood is not for them.","label":0},{"review":"This movie is undoubtedly 9 ne of the best movies of salman khan till date. What is interesting is how perfectly each character is portraying it's part. I loved jacqueline's performance as she played her role beautifully.  The chemistry of Salman and jacqueline is mesmerising and enchanting. .....","label":0},{"review":"I have see this movie with my friends circle. Salman's entry and stunt was amazing and create more interest to watch full movie... i am fan of her beauty - Jacklin.\n\nAll its good movie. Can watch 3-4 times..not boring.. \n\nRavi Solanki\nBrand Me","label":0},{"review":"This is the worst remake of the movie. A pure hero glorification movie with the main lead overacting. It can be seen so clearly that the main pead is facing some real hard time in performing that character. Repeating background music was really annoying. Only thing that can be appreciated is nawaz ji and jacqueline's performance.","label":0},{"review":"Good film for a Brilliant Actor like you good job accha lagta hai ki koi pyaar ke saath desh ki  फिक्र bhi karta hai and lots of love and best wishes to your upcoming film \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" good luck all the very best to you keep doing good work for the Nation .","label":0},{"review":"Veryyyyy good movie!!!!

Terrible direction and weak plot. Action is so bad I won’t bother about it. Also he is a superhero ripoff like batman and black panther. Why do such films even get made?","label":0},{"review":"I hv never seen any movie better than this. Such an awesome film and gives a social message.
