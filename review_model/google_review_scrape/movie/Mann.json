What is love ??? How many types ?? What's the reaction which takes place automatically upon lovers face? What's the trgedy melancholy & when and with what circumstances in ? \n Clearview of Love theme portrayed  by creative people of mann. Musics of it inspng by its sound of romance. Acting by Aamirkhan sir , no words 4 express ..\nVery very talented artist of globes  we ve found with us ..its our fortune to live in his period ..Really Aamir khan saab is God of cinema .no doubt ...Every time I cryed after watching this unique movie..watched 23 times till the date. Tinak tin song is my fvt happy love song ever and chaha hai tujhko is best sad  love song forever. I found it as best love movie.  Dev karan singh  character  got  right justice  by  mr  perfectionist  Aamirkhan  sir , the legend  in world  cinema  history  .  Climax   wonderful  .very  pathetic  atmosphere  created  .story idea  is  superb  hearttouching.   Man have to think of  own inner talent  to get  easier   perfect status  & that's  responsibility  of self only.  Love has  very potential  power  to thrill  the  bigger to biggest  problem  of life.  Never can be made   another  MANN .so it's  an unique  creation  of  Team  mann.  Aamir sir  is  gorgeous  personality  herein.  I think  except  aamir khan  none  could  have  played  much better.   Dadima-  Island  sequence  is  very  emotional   & 'd  take over the audience  to  a  new  special  world  undoubtedly.  Painting  idea  in mann  is  a  indication  of  intelectual  mind  of  Indra kumarr jee  Noshir khataw jee . Ganesh jee  choreographed  fantastically  .   Shooting  in  the ship  , amazing  experience  . Kyon  chupate  ho song  is  shootless.  Rani mukherjee  played  as  guest  or sexy girl or item   having  been  very  grateful  to  Aamirkhan  jee   since  Ghulam  .  Nice  UNFORGETTABLE  evergreen  picture  forever  .plz  frs  regularly  touch  with  this  outstanding  romantic  blockbuster  movie. My first love  also was  a  lame.  Good  scenery  picturaisation  or filming  location  is more  mind blowing  to watch  on  larger  experienced  screen.   Life is Love  enjoy  it  with jolly mood  . Alws  live  as  own  terms  of life   to.... Hamesha  apna mann ki baat  sunna  to  is zindagi  mein  khushiyan  hi khushiyan  haasil  hogi  . Hamesha  ye  karo  jo  mann  kehta  hai.  Very  philosophical  movie  so  my papa watched  it     87 times till the date.     All songs are mind blowing heart touching.Really sanjeev darshan did a magnificent job 4 all of us .Evergreen music .  Sharmila  manisha  anil every body performed  mindblowing.  A journey  from  play boy to true lover .I can remember one incident  that first time I requested my papa to bring a cassette of mann movie in 1999  and papa had bought a home theatre system  with mann cassette unexpectedly. \nSo frs watch it again ..  Not only  a lovers movie  but also 4all age groupers..Alws listen 2 ur heart.. Nice msg 2 society.  True love exists  only..Alws love with own interest..Never compromise  with own love .. Love is forever. Love all serve all & develop  ur humanity as possible  as and also must be a social activist  at ur own path ...Thanku all the viewers  . Let's  enjoy ... Be a lover truly.  Bye bye.üëåüëåüíòüíãüíö","label":0},{"review":"I don't know why critics always comes up with bad reviews to a good movie. I think critics really don't know how to watch a movie. I agree there might be a lot of potholes in a movie but after all it's a movie made up to entertain people. For me the movie is above average and I enjoyed it. Don't go critics. They are total shame for this earth.","label":0},{"review":"This film changing feeling love life.
