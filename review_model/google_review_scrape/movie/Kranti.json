[{"review":"The only sense this movie made was nonsense...so typical of those times...a script which was more suitable for Manmohan Desai potboiler with over-the-top performances & chest-thumping patriotism signifying nothing. Music of the film, though very popular, was more in keeping with the front-benchers' taste rather than patriotic fervour which the theme of the movie required. The movie, however, was a blockbuster & maybe that is all that counts.","label":0},{"review":"A great movie again by legendary Manoj Kumar with another living legend Dilip Kumar and other popular actors like Shashi Kapoor and Shatrughan Sinha.
