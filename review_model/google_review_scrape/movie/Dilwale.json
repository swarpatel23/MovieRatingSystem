Love to watch new movies with this attitude. The plot is amzing. Didn't expect it would turn out like that. If anyone hasn't noticed, at the end SRK says\" in big cities happen little problems, senorita\". It is a phrase from Dilwale dulhania le jahange. Which was awesome! Shahrukh and Kajol perfect pairing. About Varun he7 is average actor but keep trying! Kriti Sonan was good, she looks pretty. Great tanks to Rohit Shetty. üòä","label":0},{"review":"Don't read if you didn't watch this movie.\n Characters and names\nRaj Bakshi / Kaali - SRK\nVeer Bakshi - Varun Dhawan\nMeera Dev Malik- Kajol\nIshita Dev Malik- Kriti Sanon\nKing  - Boman Irani.\nRaghav - Nawab Shah.\n  \nThe story is wonderful screenplay is thriling.

It could be better if it had suspense in it like ppl could guess what's happening next so it could be mysterious and suspenseful sp that ppl don't know what happens next and are curious to know about the same. Songs are amazing. I loved gerua song alot.","label":0},{"review":"Diwale is so bad that I couldn't watch the full movie.

I don't blame Varun for overacting I just wish he hadn't attempted it because overacting is really hard to pull off. Also, Diwale's plot line is so weak.
