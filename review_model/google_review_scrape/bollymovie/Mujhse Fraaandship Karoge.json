The movie always tips you with a laugh or two. The whole new approach towards the concept of the movie. The movie giving a message is damn good and acting.\n\nWhat's Bad: A clich√® ending(which is just fine) and that the movie could explore many things more.\n\nBore Part: None\n\nReview: The movie is something I wish to see again and again. It is that good. I personally felt that this movie is highly relatable and fun.\n\nSuggestion: It is one of those sweet movies so don't expect mass and fighting.\n\nTo Watch or Not To Watch: Watch it for Saqib and fun comic.\n\n                                       A HASAN'S REVIEW","label":0},{"review":"I think is best movie bcoz this movie in which new idea ,how to choose our good life partner. sometimes bf and gf relationship lot's of misunderstandingüëà this reason sometimes make big problemüëâüèº and then break up.\nMy all dears bf &gf plz tell y,re frend y,re problem. if discuss with that problem then I know some solution obviously founded .‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç\nVaishnavi bali.","label":0},{"review":"Definitely a fun to watch with your friends and cousins.
