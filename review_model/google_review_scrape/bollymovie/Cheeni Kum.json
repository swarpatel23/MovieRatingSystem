Dialogues or maybe male lead's character portrayal was weak. The male lead's bond with the little girl could have been better.\nTo sum it up,  I loved story but actual movie need a bit of work","label":0},{"review":"It's tough for any society, not just Indian, to accept such kind of relationship, only because people worry about the partners.
