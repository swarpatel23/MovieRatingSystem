Centering around an unhappy man who suffers from the burden of paying his monthly installments, loans and EMIs and who suffers from a little more than undesirable married life named Dev whose only solace seems to limited within the walls of a compartment in his office bathroom where he does the needful after stealing photographs of the wives of other employees. So urgent is his thirst to quench his sexual desire that be goes on to hide his face in a mask to steal the photo of his boss's wife and when further precautions are taken he desperately brings in the imaged figure of a woman in exposing attire. And all through, the company where he works....Which promoted conservation of water is prompted repeatedly to the audience in the backdrop through posters and labels stamped on even the bathroom walls which brings out the ironical paradox. The cat and dog chase that ensues after Dev decides to black mail his wife's lover has been skillfully sequenced with equally gripping music to give the tension. Khan speaks through his eyes as he does in all his films, playing the titular character. The supporting cast performed with appreciable consistentsy with Divya Dutta and Gajraj Rao topping them. The screenplay was amazing and Khan had his emotions under his grip to produce it in the most appropriate bits in the most suitable time. I give the film a 3.5 out of 5.","label":0},{"review":"#blackmail #reviews #darkcomedy #irrfankhan #comedy - 3.5 thumbs up üëçüëçüëçü§ô\nBlackmail is comedy of errors with lot of quirkiness and is definitely quite engaging.

It has all the ingredients to make it a fun watch.\n\nIt's story of a middle class man and his struggles; monthly EMIs, limited salary, sales pressure and a deceitful wife.\n\nIrrfan Khan plays the role of a middle class man in a pitch perfect manner. He is so submissive to every situation in his life that you pity him. He looks so helpless still you never know what next trick he is ploting in his mind. Rest of the cast play their part impeccably.\n\nDialogues are witty and comedy is situational. Director Abhinay Deo gives another unconventional and offbeat film after Delhi Belly. His direction has that kinkiness and freshness which is not there in most of the bollywood movies.\n\nMoney and the need of it, makes you do crazy things, that's what it portrays. There is no surprise that most of the henious crimes happen due to normal situations turning outrageous.\n\nBlackmail deserves to be watched for it's simplicity and bizzare plot.\n\nP.S. The expense statement is quite chucklesome and hilarious.","label":0},{"review":"Absolutely non-sense and worth avoiding !!!\n\nFirst half makes sense though slow.But second half takes away movie in different and unwanted zones..Too many deaths/murders without any solid reasons. \nThe movie could have been made more lighter without violence and thrilling sequences.\nCops appear in the movie and disappear suddenly.Like this many questions remained unanswered and public comes out of theatre confused. \nActing is superb.Irfan lower than his best due to few dialogues than expected.\nO ...MORE","label":0},{"review":"Absolutely non-sense and worth avoiding !!!\n\nFirst half makes sense though slow.But second half takes away movie in different and unwanted zones..Too many deaths/murders without any solid reasons. \nThe movie could have been made more lighter without violence and thrilling sequences.\nCops appear in the movie and disappear suddenly.Like this many questions remained unanswered and public comes out of theatre confused. \nActing is superb.Irfan lower than his best due to few dialogues than expected.\nOverall a bad movie which could have been made better easily after a good start.

Awesome and Amazing one ,Irrfan is superb, even surpassing his own previous brilliant performances. Each character has been played stupendously by such fine actors.

Its a movie for smarter audiences. The screenplay and music is decent which adds to the positives of this movie. The only negative is a slow and drab first half, which is compensated by a brilliant and pacy second half. The people who didn't like this movie are probably the ones who love brainless movies like those which Salman khan makes. A must watch.","label":0},{"review":"Movie : blackmail\n\nA very well written screenplay with Sharp narrative.
