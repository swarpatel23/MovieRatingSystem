Thank me later 😊","label":0},{"review":"I dont know if all the reviews are sarcastic or true.. but.. WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS?

Quoting from the film(in english)\n\"THIS HOTEL HAS BEEN ABANDONED FOR YEARS..BUT LOOK AT THIS BULB, IT IS GLOWING. THAT MEANS IT IS GETTING ELECTRICITY, THAT MEANS THERE IS A GENERATOR, THAT MEANS THERE IS A WAY TO THIS GENERATOR.....THAT MEANS THERE IS A WAY OUTTTTTT!!!\n\nGuys this was the real reason why Sherlock commited suicide on the Season 2 Episode 3.\n\nNow I watched this movie as my cousins wanted something to enjoy and have fun and we decided on this because of the reviews..\n\nSeriously, \"One of the best Horror Movies of all time\"?\nIM DONE.","label":0},{"review":"It is a horror classic for Hindi films. They could’ve done much more, with the expensive set up - but due to the lack of good direction...it turns to be  an okay horror film. It is not bad , so all of you who want to watch it- go ahead. You’re in for a scare, but you need to watch it more than three times, to actually understand the story. The cast performances are good, while a few have over acted.

The plot is completely different but there is lack of direction. And some scenes are just illogical,  like why they all split together when  there many friends die.and they can wait until the morning. But if we ignore these scenes then the movie is good.","label":0},{"review":"Felt it's underrated after seeing the rating at Google. Watched it today as suggested by my friend. Truly amazing. And everytime the ghost took each one of them, my mouth went open and I was in shock for 10-15 seconds. I liked it","label":0},{"review":"Okay..So this film was scary first of all.I dont know why this film got only 4.4/10.I would rate it about 6.8/10.There were scary sounds and jumpscares throughout the film and you would get the creeps. the newcomers have done moderately successful performances,all within a 90 minute duration.However, at a few instances..I did feel that the film did not fully deliver on what it could have achieved.And some scenes were a bit too dramatic.But believe me..This ones a spine  chiller.Recommended.","label":0},{"review":"I think this is the first Bollywood horror movie which is scary and does not have any lead heroine. It is like the Hollywood horror movie. The best thing about this movie is, it does not have any heroine in whom the ghost enters and a hero saves her.\nIt is completely different. The ghost itself scares the actors.\ni really love this movie and give it 4.5/5.","label":0},{"review":"Loved this movie. Genuinely spooky and an honest storyline. Probably the only great horror movie made in Bollywood. I was shocked to see such a bad review rating.","label":0},{"review":"Awesome super duper hit!!!!!!! Like Vikram sir is the leading horror movie director and is every movie is like a WOW!!!cast and crew was fabulous \nSpecially KARAN KUNDRA (neel) & RADHIKA MENON  (NEENA) Spot was also very coollll and it is the best horror movie of bollywood ever!!!!!!","label":0},{"review":"Maybe only a Netflix problem, but the ghost's face is censored. Like, even if it's a close up shot. But whenever it isn't, the scene is cut so fast that you'd miss it in a blink of an eye. The only part I got an okay look without replaying a scene was when there was a fire and her face looked like it was projected over the footage while in slow-mo. Thought I'd find someone else review about this, but couldn't.","label":0},{"review":"Inspired by Grave Encounters, but as far as other comparisons go, it's the same cliché plot as every other horror movie.\nSome of these reviews make as much sense as the logic used by the characters in this eye-numbingly dull unnecessarily long distraction.\nA for effort. \nF for delivery.","label":0},{"review":"If u like 1920...raaz....then u will also like this...
