Unlike it is shown in the prequel, this time he doesn‚Äôt have to waste time dealing with \ncorruption that is prevelent within the system, on the contrary the Mumbai police is shown as a \ndisciplined force and united like one family, Rohit Shetty‚Äôs efforts to build a positive image of the \nMumbai police is evident in Singham Returns, but the filmmaker has unknowingly shown that even the \npolice force is a victim of blind belief, I hope in reality the Mumbai police does not sit idle \nthinking that the blessings of a Sufi phir will take care of all the incidents of robbery taking place \nin the city. Bajirao Singham has a tougher task this time as he has to locks horns with a fake godman \nessayed by Amol Gupte who along with a corrupt politcian( Zakir Hussain) is involved in hoarding black \nmoney and their men are armed with some of the most deadly wepons. Amol Gupte‚Äôs getup remindes me of \nthe contoversial god man Chandraswami, who made headlines throughout the 90s and was accused of \nrepeated financial irregularities. The budget of the film must surely have gone up as the number of \ncars reduced to pieces are far more in numbers in comparison to the prequel. Kareena Kapoor‚Äôs role \nis quite opposite to her figure conscious, low appetite image, she eats everything that her hands can \nlay on, it seems Kareena was roped in to add some comedy flavor which unfortunately failed miserably, \nit would have hardly made any difference even if the film didn‚Äôt had a female lead. Ajay Devgan is at his best \n,certain things that I found common in the prequel and sequel is Singham‚Äôs style of walking directly \ninto the villain‚Äôs den, striking fear in the hearts of all those who are on the wrong side of law. \nAction sequence is too good and exchange of fire between the police force and badmen is lively,actor \nDayanand Shetty who is seen in Television series CID and is considred a specialist in breaking doors \ndoes the same act with ease, very true! Practice makes a man perfect. I wont say that Singham Returns \nis better than Singham but the sequel deserves an audience, a lot is already spoken about the Song Ata \nMajhi Satakli sung by Yo Yo Honey Singh so I wont comment on that, but I liked the new title song sung \nby Mika, it is not part of the film but is played during the interval, the lyrics describes and \nglorifies Singham‚Äôs style, quality and nature, I would call it a Singham Chalisa.","label":0},{"review":"Movie was good but not best.\nPositives:Acting By Ajay And other actors,good songs,good actions,good cinematography,gripping emotional scenes and dialogues.\nNegatives:Worst villains ever casted, Bad editing, satisfactory screenplay,lack of perfection in gun fight scene,flat jokes.\nRohit Shetty is a very capable director but this time he missed his mark.\nRatings:6/10","label":0},{"review":"i may have enjoyed some previous movies but this one is one of the best movies i have watched. i love it and i watch it mutiple times.
