Nice entertaining movie by pr AAMIRKHAN SAAB and newcomer Abbas debutant. Rehman composed amazingly,  specially pappu can't ,kahin toh, kabhie kabhie . New talented lmran got chance by maamu jaan , impressed well  as expected. \n   It's an iconic film  for new age groups.college  masti portraying  reminds past.Good instance of friendships. New couple Imran- Genelia  are good looking. Imran simple look -handsome- sweet talk .Genelia bubbly-cutelook-beauty eyes -smile-glittering teeth;they made for each other in it. The important person's real values determines only during the absence of  him/ her. Love is very natural like autoflowed fountains. It never flows by other's directions but only soul of person rules over.Friendship is not equal to love, those are totally different things. Look-talk-touch-hugg-kiss-rub may be the part of friendships  .None can determine but only the involved individual  (pairs) can suggest Is it love or friendship!!! Love is very pure, auto creates from inner heart and soul to opposite sex in case of heterosexual. Normal law of nature of all creatures of earth. \n\n   Herein,  In the beginning Aditi-joy were friend each other. Then gradually through unconscious to subconscious mind - they made a journey on the Love highway .still they were not convincing themselves as they were just beginners.slow and steady  they realized each other What feelings  r taking place air in the absence of someone; something disturbance  sure means it is the real symptom of Love my friends.. \n   Another point  ,choosing a perfect partner is very easy. First of all,  you suggest ownself, ask to self  what's ur real quality?  Instead of getting married to a wrong  person, it is too better to be single.Anyway  sushant is arrogant, selfish, narrow outlook,no sense of humour, temper.In his heart no space for friends have.so, that's why Aditi had to break up. One sided love  is nothing; Joy disappointed with Meghna .so unnatural relation is alws boaring discomfort, should be broken.Attraction towards each other  and then taste each other nature, finally True love exists... I 'll be thankfull for director Abbas tyrewala  ,  who did good job on screen with an unique movie JAANE TU... JAANE TU YAA JAANENA \" l watched  7 times only till today,  hope in next to... special role of Naseeruddin saab cooperated by mansoor saab (aamir's cousin)  . AAMIR SIR WON THE  HEART OF HIS CHACHA JAAN HAVING CHANCED HIS GRAND SON IMRAN AS DEBUTANT REMINDING MANSOOR'S QSQT .\n   Meanwhile my dearfriends watch it with full of enthusiasm curiosity  & take charm of sweetness. Let's enjoy. Have a good luck. üñíüñíüñíüíúüñé","label":0},{"review":"Milestone movie.

How it starts from a death and ends with reunion. The movie is unappreciable with words. Its just fun, romantic, it even made me let live a little nostalgia. Its just the best.\n\nWhat's Bad: Nothing's perfect. Not even this. But it is negligible. It is that it is so much silly sometimes(Which even makes you laugh more)\n\nLoo Break: None.\n\nReview: The movie's just sweet, simple and romantic, funny and dramatic. And with all these, the movie handles it just fine. \n\nSuggestion: Download it as you will need it to watch it again and again.\n\nTo Watch or Not To Watch: Watch it. I bet you'll love it.\n\n                                                                                                                                                A HASAN'S REVIEW","label":0},{"review":"A perfect story telling.
