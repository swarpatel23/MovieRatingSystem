[{"review":"One of the nicest movies ever made. I just love it. The best part about it is that subtle inherent humor which can be perceived in almost each and every scene. Good work by the director and all actors.","label":0},{"review":"\"Socha Na Tha\", it came, it saw and it went away. Like me many of you would have missed it. Post-Jab We Met however rewrites the rules and I was persuaded to retrace my steps and take notice to Imtiaz Ali. Believe me - true to its title \"Socha Na Tha\" Imtiaz is a fine story teller indeed. Probably it was the timing of the release or perhaps it lacked the star-value owing to which it didn't get the recognition it deserved.","label":0},{"review":"Amazing movie.
