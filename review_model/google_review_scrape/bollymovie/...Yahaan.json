[{"review":"I saw this movie 14 years after it was made. I wish this movie could be re-released today, the time when article 370 has been revoked by the government of India in Kashmir. The movie depics how everyday life of ordinary kashmiris is fraught with uncertainty in a state torn between two factions - entities that spread terror and an army that's trying to keep peace but has not been able to win trust   of its citizens. The touching love story that's woven around the theme makes it hugely watchable.","label":0},{"review":"A very well thought and well executed movie...movie was made 10years back but is still so refreshing and contemporary. Shoojit Sircar at his best..one of the finest film maker. I fail to understand why it didn't connect with the population and didn't find a good market for the film.","label":0},{"review":"I loved this movie the moment I'd watched it. I didn't know it was Shoojit Sarcar's film and didn't know much about him until I watched Vicky's donor, Pink, Piku and now October. During October's interview I came to know that one of my all time favourite love stories was also made by the same guy. It's a beautiful film, subtely made and Kashmir adds too much beauty to it.","label":0},{"review":"This movie I saw in 2019 .\nI think I love this movie as much as Roja by Mani Ratnam sir. \nJimmy u rock great job \nMinissha lots of love for wonderful acting \nThe small kid shri good actor \nEvery scene is great \nMusic is the best \nLoved the movie \nSoojit please make one more movie now after article 370 is removed. \n\n\nPlease make it","label":0},{"review":"I loved this movie it is wonderful  message to all wars...
