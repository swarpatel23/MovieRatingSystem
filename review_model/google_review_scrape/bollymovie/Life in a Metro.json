[{"review":"I m not a fan of Bolly movies. But loved this one so much..üíñ Indeed the film is a lively portrait of the lives of the middle-class people of an Indian metro city.

I saw it again last week after many years, and still found it watchable & engaging. The format of the film is somewhat like city life in reality - many lives intersect with each other, there is much drama just under the surface, and we carry on keeping a cool exterior...","label":0},{"review":"The film, Life in a Metro, tries to protect the sanctity of long standing relationship, called marriage. However, relationships like any other thing changes over time. \n\nBy bringing Sikha and Ranjeet together again, this film confoms to regressive outlook. From that point of view, I still find, Kavi Alvida Na Kehna is more modern and realistic in its approach.","label":0},{"review":"One of the finest pieces of Cinema , Bollywood has to offer.
