The characters have great arcs. It didn't feel I was watching characters, it felt like they're real people evolving with me over the course of time. The Music & Songs are soulful, meaningful and even gut wrenching sometimes. The movie is directed and edited in a way with many flashbacks & flash forwards which creates an emotional impact. As for the flaws, the flashbacks & forwards can make few scenes confusing, where it takes a while to understand at what time this is happening. Though it doesn't affect the overall experience of the film. I Highly recommend it.","label":0},{"review":"IT is very difficult to characterize the movie with a single emotion. It is so beautifully layered that it will take repeated viewings to form a consensus within yourself as to WHY you love the film.

It's the free-falling nature of the story that gives it a feeling never before experienced in Indian cinema. The movie borders on self-indulgence every once in a while but wonderfully balances it out with realism.\nThe direction, cinematography, and most importantly the music and acting by Ranbir kapoor is of top notch. \nWe don't see Ranbir kapoor in this movie. We see a transformation of a struggling Delhi guy \"Janardan\" becoming International fame \"Jordan\"\nThe movies truly is a cult classic üëå","label":0},{"review":"Rockstar is absolute gem(4.5/5) really loved the movie.

I was reminded of the movie \"Tamasha\" which was another tamasha according to me on the audience by Imtiaz Ali.\n\nJust an implausible plot and some very bad acting by the lady lead made it unworthy of a movie made by a director who also made Jab We Met, Cocktail, Love aaj Kal & Highway.\n\nI lost it when Ranbir, the all quiet and shy guy suddenly on director's instructions started acting so aggressive to woo the gal and then in disbelief I watched how the lady seemed to be just waiting for him...come on...is this plausible!!! And a husband who allows his wife to go off to her lover just coz she wants to??? And the director doesn't even pause to explain how this could possibly happen. \n\nThroughout, the movie jumps frames as if to say that the audience is a fool and wont understand. I hate this type of movie making. I have no issues with the morality or lack of it in going after a married lady...but for God's sake make it well. And I just didn't understand why Ranbir was angry??? Was society against him to make love to a married lady?? What was the reason for his angst...I mean its so stupid to show a normal guy suddenly very angry and talk about Sadda Haq...What haq? Not explained. \n\nMost times the lady looked disinterested for a relationship and Ranbir looked like one of the thousands of creeps (men) who just don't take 'no' for an answer...and this i found very disturbing.  \n\nIt is a movie which was panned by critics and the audience and I am happy that happened. However it now seems to ring a bell with few and well...everybody has their own way of looking at things.\n\nTo me a movie you must not waste your time on!\n\nRating: 0.5/5","label":0},{"review":"Jordan's pain and subsequent success and failure are highly spiritual in nature. Rockstar signifies Imtiaz Ali's achievement as a spiritual storyteller of all times... And to heal it's minimalistic downfalls, A. R. Rahman and Irshad Kamil come together to lend the biggest helping hands ever. Ranbir's second best performance (I rate Tamasha above Rockstar) for sure. Thank you Imtiaz!

Though I like Imtiaz's other films Jab we met, Tamasha, Highway, socha na tha and Love Aaj Kal. I found this just ok. Story was not bad but I found the screen play boring.

Also Aditi Rao was good. 2/5 from me","label":0},{"review":"The movie is good for most parts. Jordan (Ranbir) 5/5. Been a fan of his ever since Tamasha. However let's not forget about that little sore thumb in the movie ,Heer Koul. What a despiteful acting.
