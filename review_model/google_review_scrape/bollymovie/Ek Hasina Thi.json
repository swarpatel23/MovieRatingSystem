Everything is in tune in her life until her new boyfriend Karan, played by Saif Ali Khan calls her asking to host his newly arrived friend.\n\nThroughout the first half of the movie, Sarika hopelessly fails to recognise the truth. After realising being a victim to the trap, it gets interesting to witness the personal growth of the female protagonist, a simple dutiful girl who is now planning to avenge in hunger.\n\nThe movie is a head of its time representing a strong female lead. Accompanied by smart camera transition techniques, it made the story telling(cinematography) creative and exciting. However, few scenes were just dull and unrealistic. Nevertheless, the movie deserves a better rating; it is a thought provoking story for an early 2000s movie.\n\nThe ending isn't the happiest, so I recommend this movie to those who are in the mood to enjoy a two hour thrill of ex couple revenging.","label":0},{"review":"A decent movie with some usual not-possible scenarios but overall enjoyable movie. Very surprising but finally delighted to see a movie in which the hero does not have to be a good guy all the time. Focus is on the heroine and well done. This and NH10 were two of truly great movies focusing on the heroine.","label":0},{"review":"Edge of the seat excitement. Never knew we could hate nice guy saifu as much as we did in this movie. Rooted for Urmi all the way thru.a masterpiece.","label":0},{"review":"Well worth a watch\nSome nailbiting moments, Urmila is a smooth actor, she leads up to a suitably grisly ending. Yes, absolutely, Ek Hasina Thi. Saif makes for a glossy villain, notching up his acting chops in the film.","label":0},{"review":"Loved this movie, well ahead of its times on concept on female vigilante. The female lead avenges her oppressor by leaving him in a remote cave with mice.\nOne of the under rated movie.","label":0},{"review":"Nice.  Enjoyed. Urmila is so beautiful.
