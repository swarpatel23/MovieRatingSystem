[{"review":"I think this movie is underrated. Harman and Priyanka were absolutely great in terms of acting. Priyanka did very good in her each character. Storyline was great and intriguing. They kept suspense very well till the end. Of course screen time is very long and songs in every 15 min interval may irritate sometimes but overall it is a great movie to watch. Fresh script, nice portrayal of characters.... it's a treat to watch. Do not miss this movie.","label":0},{"review":"One of the most underrated Bollywood Romcoms!It is the modern day musical,anthology movie,romcom all rolled in one.Priyanka Chopra gave superb performance(s) and should have won awards for this.Harman baweja was also good.The music was superb throughout.Do watch it if you can..","label":0},{"review":"I think this is the best movie I have ever seen.
