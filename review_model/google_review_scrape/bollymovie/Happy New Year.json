But the fact that I really really liked about the movie is in the credits song all the production staff was introduced! I still remember Mai hoon Na for the same reason. I will not call it a bad movie but I won't call it a record breaking one either .. \nIt's an OK movie to watch, I laughed and I enjoyed.. baakiyon ka pata nahi..","label":0},{"review":"This is not one of the best movie of SRK but that doesn't means it's a bad movie .

Hats off to Farah Khan for directing such a great and Iconic movie...\n\n\n\nMajor sarcasm intended.","label":0},{"review":"This movie is literally the Indian version of ocean's eleven wait I forgot to mention the worst! Farah khan didn't even feel the need to mention it was inspired at least from that movie. I love SRK but this is not acceptable. So this is story of real life where when leads meet there's fire. What even?!","label":0},{"review":"Can't say much, some scenes are enjoyable and some are terrible jokes and my rating is 3/5 for this movie. Location, scenes and music are great. Story is also good but how it is been portrayed in this movie is not matching. It should have been more of an action, thriller than than showing comedy scenes unnecessary.","label":0},{"review":"I 100% love this movie! At the end of the movie, New Years came as fireworks boomed above Atlantis when Chandramohan Sharma and his team (Team India) won the WDC.
