On the acting front, Amitabh Bachchan is brilliant as Major who has a value system even in the evil crime world.Sanjay Dutt is rock solid as the tapori,bad mouthed, trigger happy, non english speaking criminal Ajju. Suniel Shetty as Marc Issak is the surprise package in the film.With a new biker look, he is sincere & earnest in his performance. He matches the high standards of Bachchan & Dutt at every stage.Mallaika Arora Khan and Suniel Shetty make a good pair who unfortunately cannot live happily everafter.Mallaika not only raises the tempetature with her moves but also is natural in the two scenes she has to act. Mahesh Manjrekar is superb as the hakla gangster with a bad past.He is a joy to watch.Lucky Ali makes a memorable debut as an actor playing the titlular role.Kumar Gaurav is watchable playing the simpleton amongst the criminals. Music,dialogues and cinematography of the film are its USP. They play a pivotal role in making this flick a CULT CLASSIC.  Rama Re,Chodna Chodna Chodna Re & Maut are still popular.\"Hindustani jaisa bhi ho, usse do cheeze pasand nahin :Ek hai Cricket main HAAR, doosra apne desh pe VAAR\" still resounds in my ears till date!","label":0},{"review":"Don't go on IMDb ratings this movie is upto the expectations I had from it before watching.
