And doing everything independently... according to your own IMMATURE mind.\n...As if... nobody is superior to you... and YOU NEED NOT LEARN ANYTHING FROM ANYONE...!!!\n\n\nThe HIGHLIGHT of the film is -->\n\nThe film maker has done a very challenging job... of showing a MORALLY INCORRECT man as a RIGHT & LEGITIMATE one...!!! ...thereby making him acceptable to the society (audience).\n\nIt is like.... Serving the poison to the Audience...by playing melodious background songs.\n... And making sure... that the Audience eating the poison...is FEELING HAPPY to eat it...!!!\n\nBelieve it or not.... But it is the truth of the CONTENT of the film.\n\nThe HERO's mentality in the film shows that there is NO need of any rules [ DO's & DON'Ts ] ... in the society.\n....and Anything can be done by anyone.\n....and Nobody should be answerable to anyone in the society.\n\nJust do whatever you like..!!\n\nThroughout the film, the hero NEVER LISTENS to anybody....\nEven his own family members and friends are worthless for him....till the end..!!\n\nHe is shown as ALWAYS READY TO FIGHT with BOTH  his enemy and even his OWN FRIENDS üëé  üëé  \n\nThe Hero USES his family....  as a means of fulfilling his \"DRINKING & SMOKING\" Needs.\n\nAnd he USES his friends....  to show his power and influence in the LOCALITY.\n\n\nWhatever he believes and thinks...is the ONLY THING that matters in the whole film.\nThe Hero is CLEVERLY portrayed by the film maker as -- \"ALWAYS RIGHT\" in the movie.üëé  üëé  üëé  \n....and his every NON SENSE act and deed is GLORIFIED by melodious background tunes and songs.\n\n\nThe \"HERO\" of the film shows that it is perfectly normal if you roam around all the day like a Street-dog with your friends...without doing any work.\n....And it is also OK if you feel NO RESPONSIBILITY towards your parents, your work, even your own self...!!\n\n\nThis film shows that --\nIf you don't get the BOY or GIRL of your choice,   then ---\nYou should either Kill Yourself (COMMIT SUICIDE).\nAs the heroine did in the film.\n\n.....Or you should CONSCIOUSLY go to a mental asylum and spend there the rest of your life INSPITE OF KNOWING THAT YOU ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL !!!\nAs the hero did in the film.\n\n\nIt is difficult to understand whether the lead actor is playing the role of a HERO or a VILLIAN....!!!\nBecause in the end....he ultimately does everything WRONG with himself...!!\n\n\nThe film gives a VERY TOUCHING LESSON that --->\n\nWhen a person gets ILLUSIONED by the storm of UNCONTROLLED DESIRES arising in his mind... then the person ---\n---forgets his/her own primary care\n---loses emotional and mental balance\n---throws away all the MORAL VALUES into the Dust-bin\n---and starts doing the things which leads him/ her towards SELF DESTRUCTION.\n\nIn other words, when SELF DEVELOPMENT \nleaves behind all the MORAL VALUES....... and goes hand-in-hand with UNCONTROLLED DESIRES ....... then it leads to SELF DESTRUCTION.\n\nBut the film justifies the hero's and heroine's every nonsense & irresponsible act ....by playing melodious background tunes and songs..... and showing that EVERYTHING IS FAIR IN LOVE\n... (even self-destruction).üëé  üëé  \n\nTHE MAIN THING that makes this (MORALLY RUBBISH)  film a 'HIT'.... is that   the film maker has successfully been able to SHOW & GLORIFY... the hero's every \" MORALLY WRONG ACT\" .... as the \"RIGHT & LEGITIMATE\" one.\n\nAnother thing making the film a \"HIT\" is the songs.\n\n\nWe MUST REMEMBER that -->\n\n1. Self care is NOT Selfish.\n2. Self destruction is NOT Love.\n3. Self development is our FOREMOST DUTY.\n4. MORAL VALUES is not something which is possessed by the fools.... But it is the JEWEL OF THE GENTLEMEN.","label":0},{"review":"Everything about the movie is great. Be it acting, editing, direction. It's such a beautiful movie and is emotional as well. Salman Khan's acting is just great. It is one of the best bollywood movies made. It has lived up to the standards set by Sethu- the original version. Bhoomika Chawla is just apt for the role. Her innocent looks make her perfect for the role of Nirjara. She is worth the award she won for her debut role. The music is just soothing. \nThe movie is perfect","label":0},{"review":"Mr. Yash Yug. U told, u r the bigest fan of Salman Khan, I respect your choice. Tere Naam is a very good movie for me. Salman Khan did awesome job.
