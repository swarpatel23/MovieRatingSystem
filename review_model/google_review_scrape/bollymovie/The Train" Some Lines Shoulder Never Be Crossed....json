[{"review":"Movie is one time watch. Emraan's acting abilities will hold you to last. Songs are really impressive but overall, I would say, movie is nat that good. I'm still unable to figure out why is investigation officer introduced in the movie as his character plays an incomplete role. Also, why the robber-couple used the same hotel as previous one when they had removed every other clue related to them.\nSuspense is there. Movie runs fast in the second half.","label":0},{"review":"Very  nice, one of the old movie witch they've made with perfect  accuracy.  I really liked it very much.
