The move is full time pass and I had a great time watching.\nThe story is on a similar lines as Herapheri. Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty are friends and want to get rich as soon as possible otherwise their girlfriends would be forcibly married by their family to someone else. Their scheme of getting rich lands them in Pan Pacific Hotel where Paresh Rawal is trying to get his son Chunkey Pandey married with Sameera Reddy. Now starts the confusion of mistaken identity, lies and what not. All the confusion reaches its summit and explodes in the end.\nThings I like in this movie ~ some good funkiest dialogues, some funny punchlines, some funny scenes that holds your attention, whole Katrina Kaif and some good songs...","label":0},{"review":"'ddd' did avg.business on box office but the  film was capable to do very good business on b.o.

The main USP of the film is supporting actors who have given full justice to their role.70% co-actor has taken the responsibility on their shoulder. Not easy work to direct so many actors  hard work can be seen. Every character whether it is small/big has important role. After hrishikesh mukherjee, Priyadarshan is the only director who can give good healthy comedy film. 'DDD' can be watch 1000 times as compared to todays foolish films.\nMANTRA for  comedy films - NO SPACE FOR EMOTIONS IN COMEDY.","label":0},{"review":"I'm sure it took a lot of talent and skill to assemble the story line and ensemble cast to develop the film. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the first 45 minutes of the film when everyone is introduced and the jokes made me laugh out loud, especially from Akshay Kumar, Johnny Lever,  and Shakti Kapoor.\n\nThe remaining 2 hours were the drag where I lost pretty much the whole plot.

And that too of a fraud. \n\nAkshay Kumar spent 70 percent of the film locked in for closet. And all girls apparently just love money.  The love stories would have ended if the money did not come in the hand of the men.","label":0},{"review":"This movie is good and funny and can keep you entertained. It had good performances and some scenes can keep you laughing on and on. It's not the easiest to understand though, i had to replay parts of the movie over and over to fully understand it. So if you like simple to-the-point movies, De Dana Dan is not for you.

I loved it and can watch it over and over again.  I loved Akshay, he has great comic timing.  It was a total laugh riot.  Not boring for a minute.
