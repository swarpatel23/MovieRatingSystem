[{"review":"Ran into this gem accidentally. It is a shame that Indian audiences fail to recognize truly good story-lines, artists and movies. Had it been Hollywood or any international film industry, a movie like this would have been a massive success. All we look is for a rom-com story-line, item numbers and their even moronic sequels. It is high time we appreciate true talent. Hats off to all the artists and the crew behind this gem! You guys deserve so much more. 10/10.","label":0},{"review":"Good to see that such realistic movie is also being produced by Bollywood. It's totally the watchers fault who doesn't seem interested towards these kind of stories and like only to watch stories full of fantasy and over exposed romance scene.
