Her critics should watch it. \nNeil, John, Irfan. Good job. \n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui, you did a Phenomenal job.\n\n Like any customary story. A start of a fellowship and a future where every individual wishes to settle down for contentment. \nThree incredible beings cross paths. They embark on one hell of a journey. Each carrying out a story of their own. Wages of dreams to unload.  Life unites them, yet much to their dismay that this expedition would change their lives forever. If only they had a glimpse of their future. A foreshadow. A dull tunnel was ahead. Omar this fresh off the boat meek beguiling lad would fall in love. Little did he know it would torment him. That he‚Äôd face two heartbreaks. A broken heart and a love that's not returned. That's not it. There's plenty more horrific news in store for this chap. On the bright side fortunate to have gotten a scholarship. A scholarship that would change his life forever. Samir, on the other hand, this sturdy brilliant lad. His life. A fairytale but a twisted one. One with an agonizing end. Poor Maya. if only, ..... maybe your love was one-sided and Samir didn't reciprocate his feelings for you, and that horrendous night didn't happen you'd be with Omar. It sucks to Omar. He never stopped loving Maya after all those years. A Friendship with an astounding beginning but a painful end. We're the inclusion. Verily whatever happens around us will eventually have an impact on our lives. 9/11 happened. Muslims became a target. Innocent lives were ruled guilty. Their dignity stripped away. Most importantly their freedom vanished. The place they once called home haunted them. Their identity spewed hate. Because of one incident, a religion was targeted. Islam. A community. Muslims. Human beings lost their human rights, lives. Abused and violated.","label":0},{"review":"Have just watched this movie couple of times but I have to say this movie still has that impact on my mind. Some very sad and disturbing moments in the movie. Great acting especially by John and Nawaz, good songs and brilliant direction. 1st half is little slow but 2nd half is so good and touching. I must mention about the climax, it is very sad. Overall very good movie. 3.75 out of 5.","label":0},{"review":"A similar mistake happened in my name is khan..i really wish to believe they dont make such mistakes on reality..i think of america as an open minded country and dearly wish it to be true.. i wish the govt.
