The story revolves around the core theme that One has to rise among all odds take the \"dor\" of one's life coz life can't go on like in utter despair forever. There would be hurdles to cross to ,to be bumped again & again doing what one pleases as Zeenat says u have get ready to face the consequences of ur decision as the power to take decision comes with a conditions but at least u would be following ur heart.\nThe mesmerising backdrop of Rajasthan has put class to the story line.\nThe melancholy satire on the way the society functions just as the society demands to be ,deciding everyone's life like a catapult throwing from one corner to another as it wishes. Life is too short for such narrow concerns & following the heart can only lead to satiation of one's existence.\nThe last scene was truly touching when meera catches the train along with Zeenat portrayed that living a life where u r not happy is worthless better to throw that away & begin afresh coz life dor  should be in ur own hands not expecting a \"farista\" to come & change everything.. That is I believe why God has provided a brain for...Let the perception of society go to hell, at the end of the day what really matters is the happiness of one's own soul.","label":0},{"review":"This is the best movie.
