Music was not that good but who cares when you've all the other things just right. The intriguing and spellbinding quotient of the film is just Wow.

RATING: 4.25/5 !!","label":0},{"review":"Such a fun movie it does start slow but then when it gets to the rising action, it literally keeps you on its toes...
