Don't understand why this movie has low ratings everywhere. It's very beautiful, very emotional and heart touching movie. All 3 stars Kajol, Kareena and Arjun have acted brilliantly.

Writing review for an 8 year old movie sounds weird but I loved the movie and couldn't resist posting the review.","label":0},{"review":"I personally loved the movie.It was an unusual plot, something that was different from the normal hero-heroine love story based movies.The songs were great.The movie could leave anyone in tears,as in the scenes when Maya was admitted to the hospital and  when her children badly missed her were  heart renching.Even the ending part was perfect.Loved it!!!","label":0},{"review":"I like the film.
