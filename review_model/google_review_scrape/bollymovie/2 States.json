I personally am not a fan of chetan bhagat's writing skills, however, i did fall in love with the story in the book. however, the movie disappointed. The direction is bad and very vague. apart from pivotal scenes being deleted, a lot of times the editing of the movie too disappoints. for example, the song chandaniya, which has a peppy beat, plays during the saddest scene in the movie when ananya breaks up with krish. A lot of scenes depicted in the trailers and songs release online are not there in the movie,To add to the misery, Arjun kapoor has pretty much the same expression throughout the film. he looks bored and constipated. His extremely muscular look is out of place for a studious IIT-IIm nerd.\nAlia bhatt however, has perfectly adapted into this role. She look a tad bit young to be an IIM graduated, but she does play the role of ananya swaminathan pretty well. Even though I may have criticised this movie a lot but it  is worth a single watch.The songs of the movie are really good though, peppy, upbeat and really catchy!Shankar-ehsaan-loy have really outdone themselves with the music this time.","label":0},{"review":"This movie is one of my favorite movie. \"Love does not trap in religion boundaries it is beyond all of this\"movie gives this message.
