[{"review":"The movie was set with an objective of remaking 1983 Himmatwala with latest star cast. The story line is poor, story so very predictable and scenes are much different from the original version. Watch it only for Tamanna because she is the only watchable thing in the entire movie.","label":0},{"review":"you really have to be a HIMMATWALA & not essentially an INTELLIGENT or rocket scientist\n\nSuchha bakwaas remake of a classic by SAJID KHAN\nAjay Devgn looks fools \n& talented actor like Mahesh Manjrekar wasted\n& Paresh Rawal damn worst of his illustrated career\n\nWatched on UTV & am sure Ronnie Screw-this-WALA\nHAHAHAHAHAH","label":0},{"review":"It is an wonderful film ever seen.
