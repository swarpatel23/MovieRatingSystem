[{"review":"The movie truly intricates the confusion all the twenties young brats go through. You know what you want but you want better, you know what you have but you want better. And just like that, love happens, we loose, we learn and we reconcile. Aisha is a simple girl (only in thoughts) and goes through a series of reconciliations and love-makings and in the end find love in what she had in the first place. A cute and honest lovestory.","label":0},{"review":"Amazing movie! being a Delhiite I can associate myself with it. The most amazing thing is that it is an adaptation of a novel Emma by one of my favourite writers Jane Austen. Reading her novels and discussing with my mates during my preparations for NET in Sahitya Classes by Vineet Sir was just amazing.","label":0},{"review":"Wow! what a movie. Just loved it.

Aisha wants to make perfect everything by matchmaking but she herself jeopardizes her own life and others too.

And thus, the brownie points for this movie. :)","label":0},{"review":"One of my favorites‚ù§ This movie delicately covered Delhi young brats & their lifestyle.
