Srideviji deserves the national award for this role","label":0},{"review":"Beautiful movie!! Sridevi does not merely act, she lives, that's how extremely talented she is. Shashi potrays every Indian middle class housewife, always working for her family without a thought of herself, her comforts, her little needs , her joys or her insecurities. It's always the family ( most often thankless and uncaring towards her, always taking her for granted). It's a thought provoking movie that everyone should see.","label":0},{"review":"💯 ⭐️each time you watch this movie!\nI am sure it gonna make you smile, the screenplay is impeccable. Leave the rest to the actors each of them reminds me of my own self somewhere!\nAnd Lt.

I rate this movie 4.8/5.","label":0},{"review":"Shows how much effort an Indian lady has to put in to get appreciation from her own family.
