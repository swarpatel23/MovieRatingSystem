[{"review":"Beautiful movie. Perfect blend of emotions,  situations, misinterpretations...and what not. Director Pankaj Kapoor blends and merges the contemporary indian scenarios - babri masjid demolition, 1992 blasts, kargil , gujarat riots. I Waited till last to know what happens finally. I saw it on 2/6/18, almost 7 yrs of its release, still it feels fresh.
