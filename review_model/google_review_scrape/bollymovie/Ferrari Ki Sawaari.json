[{"review":"A beautiful story of a bond between a son and his father who's willing to go to any lengths to fulfil his son's dream of playing at Lords. Sharman Joshi has played his part of the father to absolute perfection. To this date, It remains one of my favourite Hindi movies which I can watch anytime, not just because it's a good story but because its a story that most of us can relate to. All in all, a really good movie which isn't appreciated enough.","label":0},{"review":"Such a wonderful movie. Heart touching story of a cricket loving/playing family. \n\nFilm beautifully portrays that for Indian middle class dreams are expensive, they have a cost attached to it. Also, how family goes beyond limits to fulfill the dreams of their loved ones.\n\nSpecial love for the child artist.","label":0},{"review":"Amazing movie. Storyline direction was superb. Actors acting were too good and dialogues was awesome. Speciallys Boman iranis what is so good about the night truly  funny. In last scene  I was surprised  that Sachin Tendulkar is there as a camio but he was not real Sachin Tendulkar  . It was all feak. But nice movie. Songs were truely good.","label":0},{"review":"Actors like Sharman Joshi, R. Madhvan, Shreas Talpade, Arshid Warsi, some few more names are really underrated actors in bollywood though they acted meaningfully.\nThe reason may be parcility by senior actor-director, Producers who gave chance only their sons, daughters for giving roles in films.","label":0},{"review":"I love Sharman Joshi very much really mean it being really talented I don't know why Bollywood  don't value him. He deserves a lot.\nSecondly Shreyas talpade , Jr.AB, Vikram, Akshay Khanna are equally good but still have such bad position.","label":0},{"review":"Sharman is one of the most underrated actors of Bollywood,  unfortunately the viewers in our country do not much appreciate good content movies and stars.
