She has done a very beautiful work as a journalist. The movie clearly  portrays all your Doubts about God's existence,Which God to Believe.!! Though the cocept of movie have been copied from 2012 movie \"oh my god\".A must watch. If not for fun then for the content it presents. The ambiguity of our societies and the unexplained norms or barriers are explicitly shown to generate evolutionary thoughts. Definitely 5 stars.","label":0},{"review":"PK is an incredible movie that communicates a very complex and personal topic extremely well that, hopefully, most will understand.

I would encourage everyone to see it, and then see it again.","label":0},{"review":"I am big fan of aamir sir but BIG disappointment...

But they probably should have shown the how islamic jihadist terrorists misuse religion.This is a much bigger problem. At least the hindu priest aren't killing people. It only shows misuse of Hindu religion issues because it's the major religion of India. But I'd like to see a movie that addresses problems in Islam. But overall I enjoyed this movie a lot and the actors did great.","label":0},{"review":"PK is a story of pure love for me. When I first started the movie I was very confused because I was wondering how can a story with an alien turn into to something meaningful and excited. But turns out that PK fascinated me. It's one of my favourite movies of all time. It showed me how weird is it like to be a human. It showed me how we put borders to ourself and live like robots. It showed me how to sacrifice and what true love is. This movie is magical. Everyone should watch it. Don't leave it  ...MORE","label":0},{"review":"PK is a story of pure love for me.

The film tells us to place humanity above religions. It is fully logical- God is our father. When we need something we ask that directly to our father. He does not tell us to pour a cup of milk on his head or do a fasting.","label":0},{"review":"Message given was judge a person humanly keeping religious affiliation in the background....but this was with copious amounts of anti-Hindu flair.

Recently I found out that the film director is an outspoken anti-Hindu. Try giving parallel message to Muslims for their teen talaaq, purdah and other medievalistic rituals. Bollywoodians want to live in their own Wonderland and don't want to have anything to do with reality. Certainly not for Hindus.","label":0},{"review":"In the movie , anushka sharma pokes fun when she runs after Amir Khan, alien in the movie. \nShe has done a very beautiful work as a journalist .\n\nThe film has mind blowing music. \n Good luck to entire cast of pk.

A must watch for anyone who is religious, non-religious, likes humour and more","label":0},{"review":"This is a must watch movie. It takes  brilliant and brave mind to put this together and have an alien to tell the truth. I love this movie because i never limit myself with religions.  Serve humanity! . I see many reality and facts that finally came to light in this movie.","label":0},{"review":"One of the best movie i have seen ever . Telling truth to pupil but it is really disappointing that many of us never use our own brain but blindy following what babas or our forefather had told us even some of us  are ready to kill anybody for religion.ðŸ˜¶Best part about movie is it has targeted every religion","label":0},{"review":"I have only one thing to say and that is this is an awesome movie. It shows us some scams that some people are doing in the name of religion and fooling people and getting benefits from them. And for some people who gets confused this movie does not disrespect any religion instead it tells all people of different religion to live in harmony trusting each other","label":0},{"review":"Absolute brilliat and tried to give a very good message. Aamir sir performace was just WOW. Some how direction and screenplay was good. I can say that it is a must watch movie for all indians because the kind of message this movies gives is incredible..","label":0},{"review":"I see people liking the movie. But little after they start discussing the movie has shown about Hindus and not about Muslims and so on and the very though that comes into my mind is people just want entertainment and they are not interested in real issues. They just want to make money and party. What happens in the world has no meaning for them. Even though the movie clearly said what it wanted to say people aren't willing to listen. They want to live in their own wonderland.","label":0},{"review":"A good message delivered in the form  of entertainment. Movies like this are very rare . I'm not an prolific movie watcher. But there are some books and movies which you cannot miss before you die.  \nA movie which touched my heart after 3 idiots..","label":0},{"review":"This is what Indian directors are making movie on. There are more things on which the movie can be made. Movies are made to make people entertain as well as to make people passionate or make them confident. Most of the bollywood movies are now a days focused on a particular religion. This movie is spreading hatred among the people.","label":0},{"review":"I will say PK is one of the best movie with a great meaning behind it. Aamir Khan i love u and ur great works. Keep it up. I will be experting another great movie from u next year.","label":0},{"review":"Just caught this movie on Netflix about an Alien visiting earth.

They pray wrong Gods that was nevet create. This movie must watch Hindu peoples. It proofs that Islam is True and Allah is right we all should pray  Allah","label":0},{"review":"This movie is great. Everyone should see this film and know who God is. Which religion is best known by God? Muslim religion is the best religion.In the Qur'an, God has said that the most complete religion is Shi'a.
