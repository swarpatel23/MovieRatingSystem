I love Rachel Shelly, because she's done great supporting actress role, and last but never the least Paul Blackthorne your acting was phenomenal. You it's not very easy yeh to assan nei hai to act as a villian. But he also nailed it. Laggan is a story of a young 1893 villager who brings freedom for India by playing cricket. I absolutely loved watching this movie. By now it's has totally been one of the best Bollywood Movies which I have ever seen. Anyway Happy Bollywood Movie Day to you all and be safeü§ó","label":0},{"review":"This movie was more like watching a prolonged , semi - boring cricket match in a stadium , rather than a film in a theatre .\n\nThe novelty of this period film wore off halfway through the movie & the only recurring thought was ' how much longer is this tedious film ?

'\n\nThere are several famous films which run into the 3 - 4 hour categories & are engaging in every frame , right till the end . Sadly , Lagaan isn't one of those ...\n\nWas relieved when it go over . Took off from the theatre at top speed & haven't cared to revisit this mind - numbingly long film in 17 years .\n\nThough a different genre , Nagesh Kukunoor's ' Iqbal ' ( 2005 ) is a much better ' Indian cricket ' film . Low budget , yet high in content .\n\n( Aamir Khan could've done without embellishing his character Bhuvan - an illiterate indian villager , with an aristocratic white lady , Ms. Russell , being silently in love with him - if I remember correctly , the film was ridiculous enough to absurdly imply that she was so in love with him that she remained unmarried till she died - such are the preposterous fantasies & daydreams of desi boys ... Lol . Khan seems to have a pattern - he had a white fan in 'Rang de basanti ' as well ... )","label":0},{"review":"One of a mesmerizing clip was, when a British went for hunting, bhuvan alias Aamir Khan pelts stone just before shooting from them, so that deer run away from upcoming threat. That was one of the heart touching scene.  Overall movie was quite at it's best, giving inspirations to all sections of society to overcome hurdles by beating them with hard labour.\nIf u work honest and hard, god will also help you","label":0},{"review":"A fantastic film although it is 3+ hours long it seems to fly by.\nThe characters are somewhat Fellinni like in nature but the story is certainly not Fellinni like.  The imagery is so well defining of a period in British vs Indian history it immerses you into that time and feels like you are a part of it.\nEach character is well defined to the point of authenticity they feel like neighbors you knew in a past life.\nLAGAAN is a must see film.","label":0},{"review":"The soundtrack paints emotions extremely well, whether it's joy or suspense. The acting is also top notch, the actors put a lot of emotion and passion into their roles. The characters are also likeable, and they are fleshed out. \n\n                                    - 9/10, Must watch","label":0},{"review":"One of my favourite move of all time.
