[{"review":"It's  a phyco movie. It shows the mental status of director towards a lady. Suppos a women was in relation with a man before her marriage. And now she is changed totally and ready to establish her home.  But the man is always conscious towards her old past. Why he is love with that women whom he thinks that andhe is liar. In this case the man is untrue towards the lady.\nI have full sympathy for Kareena as an role in this movie.","label":0},{"review":"beautiful movie. and totally practical. and just look at the casting. ajay devgan , nasserudin shah, vivek oberoi(excels in gangsta roles), saif, konkona, deepak dobriyal and gangs of wasseypur ka sultan and the coy kareena . wonderfully directed. but the mainstream audience might find it boring. i absolutely loved it. better than Haider (superb in itself)","label":0},{"review":"Aamir Khan refused to play the role of Langda Tyagi.
