[{"review":"It's truly a feel good movie,  no less, no excess,  well scripted,  well directed and touches the reality of the world.  Sometimes we even unknowingly put so much pressure on a person who's just living his/her life on his/her choice........ \n\nActors fit into their respective characters... Barun did an appreciable job, he's just perfect.","label":0},{"review":"The movie is a feel good movie. It has so many shades, so many emotions. I enjoyed watching all the characters. Everyone did justice to their characters. The lead actor and actress did an amazing performance. Varun Sobti's performance was truly amazing. He's so good looking. The actress was stunning too. They both looked good together. The movie is a sweet, nice romcom. It is worth watching.","label":0},{"review":"Barun sobti is the only actor bringing life to his character.
