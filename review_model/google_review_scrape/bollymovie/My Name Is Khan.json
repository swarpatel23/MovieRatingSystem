But anyways, here it is...\n\nIn nutshell, this was a Bollywood movie, made for Hollywood audience. A world class movie in real sense with equally mesmerizing performances from SRK, Kajol and of course, Mr Johar, the director. And this happens often. Talented people like Karan Johar, give their best, their everything to one project. They pour everything, even their soul, just to realize they probably knew already....Bollywood is not for such movies.\nI still remember when this was being released. They tried to do everything perfect. even the publicity was very good and there were many new things tried for publicity. I guess it was 2009 - 2010, and India, with its 1200 M population was still not using android phones like they use now. If this movie was in 2019, it would have done well. Not only in terms of earning money, but in terms of earning fame too.\n\nIt is funny though, that had this movie was from Hollywood, with some big actors, the same Bollywood audience would have praised this. There would have been crowds outside theaters. The Bollywood audience, understands good movies masterpieces but they don't want their own people to make one. If you are a Bolly actor or director, you must make only masala movies.....Indians believe that only Hollywood can make a masterpiece, and all the characters speak must speak English if it is a masterpiece...\n\nIt is my sincere belief that this film had every potential to win an Oscar award. It had everything. But for the reasons said above, it did not happen. SRK and Johar again went on making masala movies.\n\nThe film begins with a wonderful performance from veteran actress Zarina Vahab. The young generation would not know how famous she was in her time. She delivers a wonderful permanence as mother of SRK. The film continues with equally good performances from SRK, Kajol and Sonya Jehan. Jimmy Shergil, well,you notice him.\nSRK did really good, portraying the character of Rizwan, suffering from Asperger's Syndrome. ( yes, I did not know what it is before this ) At the time of release of this movie, he was on the top of the world, playing romantic a action roles, ruling box office. So was Karan Johar. The only reason I can think of they made this, was to quench their thirst for creativity.\n\nThe move is really good and smooth till the first half. It loses it a bit in the second half, and good performances re washed away by weak pen. An Indian, wanting to meet US president, just to give one emotional message, was not exactly the audience wanted. But then, who knows what audience want?? But still, in the whole, this is still a very good movie. And even after these years, there are people who still watches this.\n\nWatch this, for brilliant acting from SRK, Kajol and others. Music, was ok. Screenplay, good in first half. Direction, five stars from Karan Johar, and same to SRK for keeping those eyes straight and delivering one of his best performances...","label":0},{"review":"This one's a powerful character drama. Watched it years ago but there are certain things that made this film memorable even today: and one of them is undoubtedly Shah Rukh Khan's outstanding performance.\n\nThe film is very serious and indeed depressing at times, but then, just like The Shawshank Redemption, it showcases the power of hope. It inspires the viewer to be hopeful and be good. It's full of emotional moments that make one care for the protagonist even more.

The music truly resonates.\n\nI think this is one of the most powerful drama films of all time. Despite of its long duration, My Name is Khan is a film that will make most viewers emote when they see it. One of the best movies of SRK!\n\n9/10.","label":0},{"review":"\" A Must Watch\"\nThe only thing that you could take from this movie is that love is everywhere you just need to open your eyes and see it .
