Stage, unlike the movies, is a whole new ball game and not everyone who is a good actor can do it. I have seen the original Gujarati drama, a number of times and I have experienced the magic that Paresh Rawal could create. He use to rule the stage and entire hall with his acting, dialogues and his timing....it is was those times when 'Arjun' was just released and Paresh was tasting the new taste of fame....not many knew his this side of drama and he still continued drama even long after he got further more success....\n\nThis movie, is nothing compared to the drama. With three episodes of one hour, and only one stage, one set, the way Paresh and Swarup Sampat acted, along with great performers like Sharad Smart, is still unmatch. \n\nParesh Rawal came with another drama, 'Shiracched', meaning decapitation, immediately after this, which was good, but the impact of Maharathi is such, that no work could match it...\n\nWell, I could only say, that movie adaptation is OK, and I will recommend it, only if you cannot see the drama....I still want to recommend that watch drama first....pay whatever price they ask, if they ever do it again, and be there......I could only hope that Pareshbhai still has that fire inside him, which he had in early nineties.....","label":0},{"review":"One of the best movies.
