[{"review":"An extremely good movie. Does not haveych inconsistency although the plot is quite complex. Acting by all esp the so beautiful isha is too much. Wonder why it did not get much commercial success.  The outlook of the movie is very modern. Hard to believe this was shot in 2002 03 timeframe an released in early 2004.\nI fond a lot of horror movies created later  have copied motifs and themes from this movie full of originality.","label":0},{"review":"Ahh. The old ekta kapur movie.\n\n1>Inconsistent plot\n2>raaz pichle janam ka reference\n3>the signature move of ekta kapur. Faltu k effect which has no necessities\n4>bad cast I mean sohail khan who hires sohail khan.. could have taken anyone but they decided sohail khan\n5>songs were good but still not necessary\n\nConclusion:- Ekta Kapur cant make good movies and this is a proof of it. Thats why it got so average score in box office","label":0},{"review":"I would just like to appreciate the effort Ekta Kapoor has put to entertain the world by making this movie.\nEkta Kapoor's works like Kasawti Zindagi ki was at one time a big hit and our whole family used to get together at night to watch the show and we made sure we never missed a single episode. Thank you for making us smile.","label":0},{"review":"Awesome movie.
