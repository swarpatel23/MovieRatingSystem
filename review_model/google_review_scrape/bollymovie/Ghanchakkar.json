[{"review":"I don‚Äôt know why major portion of film lovers have not seen or liked this movie. It‚Äôs a fantastic work with superb acting from all the cast. Given that it‚Äôs a dark humour/comedy/satire movie, it was expected that it won‚Äôt do good at box office. The plot , storytelling and character build up was excellent. This should be a cult classic.","label":0},{"review":"Ghanchakkar is one of the best movies I've ever watched. Its a comedy thriller. It keeps you up till the end.
