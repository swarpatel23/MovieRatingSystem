A mother's struggle to flee from a war zone especially from her in-laws home after her husband's (Sanjay Kapoor) death is what the movie is all about. SRK's character is impressive even if it is for brief moment. All the characters are praise worthy as each of them have brilliantly acted and my God, the editing & the visuals are awesome. The director and script writer are the people we all should thank for brilliantly representing a deeply moving film.","label":0},{"review":"A very moving film... Though most of the film is about Nandini's struggle to flee, there is never a dull moment. She succeeds but fate had other plans for Jaisingh who helped Nandini a lot in her pursuit, and who like her always had a dream destination to reach, away from the village. Acting of all the characters elevates the content to a new height. A must watch film!","label":0},{"review":"IT IS REMAKE OF TELUGU FILM\n#ANTHAPURAM\nThis movie is Masterpiece(hard hitting drama)\n#Krishna vamsi sir is the director\n#Hindi version is not comparable to the original one which was blockbuster \n#Same director made hindi version too..\n#I SUGGEST YOU WATCH THE TELUGU VERSION and WATCH ALL KRISHNA VAMSI MOVIES which were later remade into hindi\n#HANDSOFF SIR\nWATCH #SINDOORAM MOVIE  for his ultimate creativeness.....","label":0},{"review":"One of the best movie, each role is awesome super.
