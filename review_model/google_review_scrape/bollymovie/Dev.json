His friends forcibly make him send friend's request to Meghana Padmavati (Rakul Preet Singh) and for some reason he falls for her seeing her profile. \n\nHowever Meghana CEO of Dictate Inc thinks differently and both views life differently. To findout where the romantic journey between Dev and Meghana whose thought process diverge, leads to ,enjoy Dev on silver screen. \n\nPerformances\n\nKarthi is ok with his looks and worked hard to elevate the scenes with his performance. Rakul Preet Singh is ok with her looks and performance. Others like Ramyakrishna and Prakash Raj didnot get much chance to perform. Vamsi \nKrishna,Renuka,RJ Vigneshkanth,Amrutha Srinivasan,Karthik passed through the motions. \n\nAnalysis\n\nRajath Ravishankar on debut came with an interesting plot to highlight the emotions when two persons with divergent views fall in love. Though the line looked interesting with good climax, he failed to develop into a good story with an interesting screenplay and direction. \n\nSo except for few interesting dialogues, emotional  and sentimental scenes between Karthi and Rakul, the story never takes off. With no story, scenes come and go dragging the entire narration in a never ending manner. Rajath Ravishankar failed to come with a solid story, screenplay and failed with his narration and direction thus losing a golden opportunity. \n\nIn his tryst to highlight the emotions between two lovers, he failed completely with the story and screenplay. He tested the patience of the movie lovers right from the start till the finish. \n\nTechnical\n\nHarris Jayaraj's songs are well shot. They are attractive and foottapping. However some songs placement tested the patience of the viewers. His background score is good and elevated the scenes. Cinematography of Velraj captured the scenic locations in overseas in a beautiful manner. Editing of Anthony L Ruben could have been far better as there are many drags which tested the patience of the movie lovers. Director Rajath Ravishankar should have worked on the story, screenplay and included few twists and turns to make better impact. Production values are good. \n\nPlus\nKarthi\nRakul Preet Singh\nCinematography\nMusic, BGM \n\n\nMinus\n\nStory,screenplay,direction\nDrags\nCliched narration\nEditing\n\nFinal Talk \n\nDon't Dare to look at Dev","label":0},{"review":"Dev is an excellent decent romantic love story which emphasis on the present generation relationship. In this movie the director has focused on the woman where she shouldn't be treated as object and as a human with feelings.Karti has done a very decent job and wisely played his role. He had set the real man stand. Hands off for the meaningful dialogues. It was heart touching. Hands off to the actress..well dressed and had great attitude.","label":0},{"review":"To be honest, this movie is not the best for the actor Karthi. And I don‚Äôt know the type of movie.

Dev is a romantic and ¬´¬†adventurous¬†¬ª and easy going versus Meghna, is a businesswoman, ruthless and cold. And finally, with magic of love they are together. \nThe last point about performance. I was wondering that Karthi put more effort and be more realistic. He is such good romantic and charismatic actor. If he would put more effort on action scene, it had been better. \nTo be watched... I give a green thumb‚Äôs up.","label":0},{"review":"Prima facie it's a Love story ,However there is a deep routed human psychology spoken about ..one it portrays how a childhood atmosphere impacts the individual,especially the character of the heroin and how such situation in her life made her feel insecured about marriage and get the biased opinions about men ...no 2 the character of hero articulates how a person need to be bold and confident when you face failures in life..very In depth meaning full movie ..and practical movie,\nHats off to the  ...MORE","label":0},{"review":"Prima facie it's a Love story ,However there is a deep routed human psychology spoken about ..one it portrays how a childhood atmosphere impacts the individual,especially the character of the heroin and how such situation in her life made her feel insecured about marriage and get the biased opinions about men ...no 2 the character of hero articulates how a person need to be bold and confident when you face failures in life..very In depth meaning full movie ..and practical movie,\nHats off to the director and the artist .. really worth to watch it many a times ...\nAnd also romantic touching scenes... awesome.","label":0},{"review":"The starting of the movie makes you think that there's something really interesting that is laying ahead...but somewhere climbing mount Everest , loving a girl who is super career oriented & vulnerable at the same time by looking at her profile on FB doesn't seem to fit in altogether .

Let the story be predicable, but the songs are good as well as the acting. I'm sure that you would feel good after watching it. After all it is a Karthi starrer, and we know according to his recent pics like Kadaikutty Singham, Theeran Adhigaram Ondru, Thozha etc.,we can predict that it is family friendly and a definitely feel good movie.","label":0},{"review":"To be frank, this film needs to be lot more improved in many aspects.
