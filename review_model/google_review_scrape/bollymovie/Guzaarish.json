Hrithik as always has nailed his role to perfectionist, Aishwarya rai is just like salt in a dish which isn't noticed much but without which the dish would have been incomplete, in the same way she has spiced her role in this masterpiece. Sanjay leela bhansali one epic director has given the best vision to the movie. Wat else can I say, i have cried the most for this movie. The movie was just 2 hrs long but made me weep forever thinking about it.\n \nThis movie isn't for all types of audiences especially not for the ones those who don't have patience. \n\nI just cannot understand why was this movie an utter flop? Hrithik doesnt deserve this kinda audience we have depreciated such an overwhelming performance by one of the greatest actors of all time\n\nI was always the biggest fan of hrithik but after watching this movie he made me worship  him\nWhenever he laughed in this movie, i wept, i wept, i wept and i just wept... \nThis is a must watch movie for all the movie lovers","label":0},{"review":"Movie is amazing with a great question.\nWhen we have a right to live with dignity then we must have the right to die with dignity.\n\nBut also here Ethan lost his hope here which delivers very bad example. We don't get everything but ending life is not the solution. I expected that after marrying he would skip the idea of death. \nSnake does not have legs but they are great predators.

Animals have lesser IQ than human do they kill themselves.\n\nI have my opinion but still this may vary from person to person.\n\nMovie is truly a master piece, well directed with great actors.\n\nJust want to add, see this movie alone and with a good mood, because other people perspective or bad mood may affect your taste of the movie.","label":0},{"review":"I just avoided the movie from 8 years just because Everyone said its no good, nothing to watch, boring etc etc. \nLet me tell you that this movie is not for every one.

After watching the movie I feel how privileged I am to walk, pick things.\nNever been so thankful to god. This movie has a lot to offer, if you are ready to accept and understand what its meant for. \nIts not a weekend movie. Its a movie where you learn about life. Specially about yourself. \n\nPS. sorry for this over emotional review but Its the fact, I am totally moved!!!!!","label":0},{"review":"Wow..

Thanks for inspiring my uncle to give up ..I LOVED HIM..","label":0},{"review":"It's not easy commenting on this movie coz how does one comment on a masterpiece.  The fear is that your words will be almost always undeserving. \n\nThis is Sanjay Leela's best ever and i really do not expect him to better this coz that good is this one.  The amazing direction with the surprise which Hrithik delivers makes it an amazing watch.  Aishwarya lights up the screen. The rest of the cast along with some awesome visuals and editing makes this a must watch! \n\n\nRating: Just watch it.","label":0},{"review":"It's a wonderful movie just like one of the dialogue of movie \" Life is beautiful\" . Hrithik and Aishwarya were fantastic. This movie makes you think that euthenesia or mercy killing should not be illegal. In some situation it must be legal. In this movie Ethan Mascarenhas is a very strong man who shows us that even in worst situation we can smile. One of my favourite scene of this movie is when a fully paralyzed man says \"zindagi bahut khoobsurat hai\" .

This is one of the best movie I have ever seen.","label":0},{"review":"Don't know Why didn't I watch this masterpiece before. I know i'm super late, to be specific 9 years. The time when the film was released there was some negativity about it & I thought Agar log bol rahe hai ki acchi movie nhi hai to nhi hogi. But that's not true everytime. \nAnyway this is such a brilliant film. The emotions portrait by Hrithik sir is out of this world. Best actor for a reason! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôå","label":0},{"review":"It takes years to understand the depth of this movie. Brilliantly made, felt and crafted. \nEach character is an epitome of commitment in this movie. I personally moved by Sofiya. The Epitome of service to mankind and commitment for it. \nI wish more Sophiyas in the world to make it better to live.\nIts THE BEST Bhansali Till date. I know Best is yet to come from him. I wish him all great work.","label":0},{"review":"It's a very heart touching movie.The same things happens with the patients of \" DMD i.e.Duchense Muscular Destrophy \".But the only difference is that the lifespan of these patients is near about 16 to 17 years, and we have faced the problem in my family.\nAnd so many times I feel that this is failure of Medical Science and Research.There is still no medicines developed for the disease of DMD.\nThe movie is very true...Now only God can stop such incurable diseases.","label":0},{"review":"This movie is not for every sort of audience. It needs a sense of sensitivity and awareness to understand and feel this movie. Hrithik has done exemplary job by portraying a handicap. Aish looks & screen presence is next level. If u love and appreciated black movie u will be touched & moved by this too.","label":0},{"review":"It's a MASTERPIECE.. the detailing, art direction, cinematography, direction, music everything is perfect. Though it's not for everyone, everyone should give it a try. Hrithik gives his career best performance playing Ethan here. Great/Outstanding would be an understatement.. Aish is also fantastic.. Bhansali's best along with BLACK.","label":0},{"review":"Its a gem by Sanjay L Bhansali.
