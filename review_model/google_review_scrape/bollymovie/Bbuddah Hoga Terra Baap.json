[{"review":"Full Power Big B. For us 90s and later kids who haven't seen the angry young man. Well I regard this one as a true blue classic. One of the most underrated films.\nMy Rating: 4/5","label":0},{"review":"There is only one mega movie star and he is none other than The Legend 'AMITABH BACHCHAN ' . His acting in all movies is very impressive and He has proved in this movie too.   Salute u sir . U will remain in everyone's heart always forever.","label":0},{"review":"If there is any 'baap' in the film industry, it is definitely Amitabh Bachchan Sahab. Well written, the story is composed of Amitabh's profound acting, great chemistry with Hema Malini, Prakash Rai's inner villain and of course, Sonu Sood's comical reliefs. A must-watch for Bachchan fans, in other words, everyone.","label":0},{"review":"My most favorite movie....
