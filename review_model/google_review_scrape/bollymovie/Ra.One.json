The direction is done in bits and scrambles, and makes the audience feel miserable after its screeentimw. The only saving grace of the film, are its thunderous song tracks and a lively performance exhibited by the lead cast, with a special mention to the dubious performance of Kareena. Although her chemistry with SRK, is not being given enough light, she does manage to save the film‚Äôs fragile story with her eccentricity of dance and diversity of emotions, making the sluggish film , a little more interesting to watch and enjoy. I give it 2/5.","label":0},{"review":"For all those critics and people who didn't like this movie, you all are illiterate.

These critics just like those so called 'art films'. I think they are biased. Commercial cinema never gets praise from them.\nAnd just to make it clear, I'm a cinema lover. I like all genres of movies. I also watch indie movies too. But all movies don't need to have just 'story'. Some have to be entertainer. And I appreciate it. There are a lot of aspects to cinema and one should notice it all not just story. That's all I wanna say.","label":0},{"review":"I don't wanna say much i personally very much like this movie,and i appreciate the fact that they made this kind of sci fi movie i bollywood.this movie is a masterpiece, i know it is not perfect and a little lose at some points but it is a sci fi movie, what do you expect?\nHollywood is been doing this for such a long lime and everyone likes that ,so why not give bollywood a chance?\nThe only reason this film crashed cause this movie was way ahead of it's time in india, but now india thrives for s ...MORE","label":0},{"review":"I don't wanna say much i personally very much like this movie,and i appreciate the fact that they made this kind of sci fi movie i bollywood.this movie is a masterpiece, i know it is not perfect and a little lose at some points but it is a sci fi movie, what do you expect?\nHollywood is been doing this for such a long lime and everyone likes that ,so why not give bollywood a chance?\nThe only reason this film crashed cause this movie was way ahead of it's time in india, but now india thrives for such movies\nKyunki sb wo chutye pyaar wali stories se bored ho chuke hain\nI don't know when we are gonna get similar movies in bollywood like this again","label":0},{"review":"I think,This movie was released on wrong date.
