The film revolves around a somewhat complicated love story where Ram hides his feelings within himself without unveiling it openly to Janu. The film also shows his state of mind as muddled and how he has lost his confidence to love someone else in his life as he's unable to forget her. The first half of the film is enchanting where their earlier school life in Theertahalli in Shivamogga is shown. The second half shows their present life and is quite a strain to watch. The actors Hemanth and Samikshaa who have played as younger Ram & Janu have performed brilliantly. Especially the cute and beautiful Samikshaa will steal your heart with her charming, sweet smile & acting. Ganesh & Bhavana have also delivered their performances very well. The cinematography by Santosh Rai is excellent and the music by Arjun Janya in this film which is his 100th one is quite good. Although there are some melodious tracks, they don't create much of an impact on the viewer. The film has a very slow pace and it drags at many places where silence & pauses are used with minimal dialogues. All in all you can watch this film if you have the patience to sit through a slow paced romantic film.\n\nThe Shy Guy's Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê","label":0},{"review":"Emotional, heart touching tale narrated beautifully.

Watched as there were no other new movies and it made me feel should never look at newspaper reviews. We should learn to appreciate the good rather than pulling down our talents by comparing with others.\n\nA great watch.","label":0},{"review":"Great direction for a very good script.Hats of to director's thought.Need guts to execute such a movie.

Sometimes making a remake too soon to a mega blockbuster like 96, can draw plenty of criticism.","label":0},{"review":"Watched today. No comment on Ganesh and Bhavana's acting.

And lastly but not the least if you compare the acting and total cinematography quality of both the movies 96 and 99 you will definetly appreciate that 96 is far behind and even not in close of 99 to be compared with. And as it is a review i must write that just watch the movie it will be a life time memory to all.","label":0},{"review":"I really respect Karnataka people and happy seeing 96 was remade in kannada.
