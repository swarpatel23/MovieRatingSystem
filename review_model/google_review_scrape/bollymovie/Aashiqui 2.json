Aditya Roy Kapur is absolutely stunning through his performance. Every fight sequence, every alcoholic sequence looks so real and natural.

Shraddha Kapoor is equally brilliant in the film and their chemistry is better than any recent movies we've seen in the past. You see the innocence on her face, wanting to help him and you see his face full of guilt and anger and insecurity. There's this scene where he's frantically searching around his house for alcohol and he can't find any, looks at Aarohi's wallet longingly, when she watches him holding her wallet. She watches him taking her purse which has all of her hard- earned money but doesn't even try to stop him. It's so heartbreaking to watch but also absolutely amazing acting. \nPS-  I haven't had sleep since I've watched the film last night, so there's a possibility that it may happen to you tooüòÇ","label":0},{"review":"It is one of the most magical movie as there are presence of love and ruined career as star Rj lost his fans due to alcoholism but he made a promise to help a small girl Aarohi Keshav who wanted to become a star.

However the movie is one time watch as it also has certain scene which makes it more emotional and mad when RJ lose his temper after his career is completely ruined. But still it was surprise to see Aarohi who actually never left Rahul Jacked due to his bad habits. But it was going great until Rahul actually commit suicide in the end while he realized that he was becoming a burden on her. Sad to see Aarohi left in broken heart. Overall the partner of Aditya Roy Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor has done the fantastic job in this film as per their characters.","label":0},{"review":"This my fav flim whenever I saw this movie (even though i don't know the language) just I'm getting emotional and what is love?
