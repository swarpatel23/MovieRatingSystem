[{"review":"KHOOBSURAT was Fawad Khan's debut in Bollywood and I think that he was pretty good in expressing his character by nailing the uptight royal who finds himself surrendering to a Mills and Boon styled romance. Khoobsurat is a fun to watch movie, for both Sonam and Fawad are amazing actors! The emotions were expressed at its best level by all the people in the film. Personally, I love this film!","label":0},{"review":"It's a must watch film for every person, it's appropriate for every age group.....story line and direction is fantastic. The royal life and the palaces are cherry on the top. Last but not least the actors did an excellent job. Sonam and fawad khan rocked it. I am totally in love with this movie. This is the only movie I watched for three times in a single day..","label":0},{"review":"The best movie I have seen. I love sonam's character. She's honest, lively, crazy doesn't give a damn to society's thoughts about her, true to herself. But that doesn't make her childish, she knows where to be mature. The best character I have ever seen in a movie. Sonam and Fawad's acting.....and the scene in sonam's room after they kissed radiates utmost genuine reality.... That's how people in this world are!!!!","label":0},{"review":"Beautiful movie, carefully crafted all sentiments by depicting the perfect amalgamation of Royal Urbanisation All the characters are framed very well. .
