[{"review":"Though Mohit Suri had a chance of making a good movie but he fails to do so.\nPositives:Acting by Emraan Hashmi,awesome songs,good concept, satisfactory screenplay,average BGM,overall satisfactory direction,last 10 minutes.\nNegatives:The greatest villain is the script and editing of the movie. I mean Mohit wanted to make A movie based on Indian Australian relations but ends up making a romantic story of boy. Only 25% of the movie deals with the topic otherwise a wasted opportunity.\nRatings:5/10","label":0},{"review":"This movie shows the orthodox nature of Indian people and Indian society, which is devastating the Indian as well as the whole world.
