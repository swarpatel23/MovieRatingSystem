But one of them saw this rating's. and then changed his mind lol just because he saw rating he reflected upon them, people can be manipulated by such so easily he was the one who liked the movie most it's rather ironic. I hope I don't have to make my point clear any more than this.","label":0},{"review":"Again!

But the most wow factor about the movie was it's action scenes and the exotic locations that can be seen in the movie. This movie also has a bit of romance in between. The songs are awesome and the dance moves were just breath taking. I mean Hrithik Roshan has danced the best in this movie compared to other movies.
