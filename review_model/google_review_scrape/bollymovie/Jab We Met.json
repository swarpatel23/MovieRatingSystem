Even if they sometimes come as unrealistic, but this movie is something different.  kareena kapoor is simply amazing n the  chemistry between her and Shaheed was incredible. Shaheed also proved that he can be taken as a serious actor.\n\nI loved the songs and the simplicity of the sets. there were no over-budgeted scenes of Indians living abroad. This movie was all in all Indian in its essence and that's what made it a big hit.","label":0},{"review":"This is my all time favorite movie. I can watch this thousand times without getting boar.

It's one of the finest romantic-drama genre movie.\nStarting from meeting of a typical Punjabi Girl to a disheartened businessman in Train to changing his outlook and marrying him,this movie changes the lovers internally.\nSomewhere down the lane every man wants a happy 'Geet' before the interval- of 1st half😊","label":0},{"review":"Jab we met is my all time favorite movie , This is the best movie of my life..it is very close to my heart my life. I often think that it relates to me,I have GEET in my life who really changed my life, I like Kareena kapoor in the movie a lot because of her acting, she is so talkative and looking good with casual attire and makeup. I like the chemistry of geet  and aditya, how aditya changes in second half of the movie is really great.","label":0},{"review":"I saw this movie just before few minutes from now. It depicts the distinct love story of a Businessmen who has forgotten every enjoyment of his life and one cool extrovert girl who just knows how to enjoy life and doing things which she loves to do so. The movie also gives scenes of Manali, a bit of  Punjab's tradition with awesome songs. It is more than a one-time movie.","label":0},{"review":"A movie with charismatic charm of the Human character & the essence of echoing human emotions..\nWorth cherishing if one is to praise the complex emotional cacophony of how human relations are beyond the narrow concerns of life & gives a social message to this hypocritical world that life is never to get urself confined to the problems in life but rather enjoying it to the fullest & let things fall into their places...\nHope this aspires others to watch again & again...","label":0},{"review":"Jab We met movie is the best movie ever in Bollywood industry I love the cute and adorable chemistry between Shahid Kapoor sir and Kareena Kapoor ma'am I love the emotional scene of  this movie where  Shahid Kapoor sir  's and Kareena Kapoor ma'am 's breath taking and sensitive acting took my heart ❤️ 😍  😘🎉  I just fall in love with the character Aditya  dharamraj Kashyap and geet  Dhillon Aditya  Kashyap 😍😍    😘😘♥️💕❤️ my congratulations to the entire team of jab We met movie and thanks  ...MORE","label":0},{"review":"Jab We met movie is the best movie ever in Bollywood industry I love the cute and adorable chemistry between Shahid Kapoor sir and Kareena Kapoor ma'am I love the emotional scene of  this movie where  Shahid Kapoor sir  's and Kareena Kapoor ma'am 's breath taking and sensitive acting took my heart ❤️ 😍  😘🎉  I just fall in love with the character Aditya  dharamraj Kashyap and geet  Dhillon Aditya  Kashyap 😍😍    😘😘♥️💕❤️ my congratulations to the entire team of jab We met movie and thanks to Imtiaz Ali  for making  a great blockbuster movie ever   😍😍🎉😘♥️💕❤️ 12 years of jab We met movie success  love you always my lion Shahid Kapoor sir and my queen of hearts Kareena Kapoor ma'am 😘♥️♥️😍  💕❤️💓❤️","label":0},{"review":"Incredible. It should be on all time great list of movies. Most of the first half you are smiling and the other half you are riveted to chair as you do in a crime thriller. Not one second of drag. \nWhat is more relevant are the dialouges of both Karena and Shahid. It is unfortunate that the understated acting of Shahid remained not appreciated but to my mind it should have earned him the best actor award. \nThe chemistry of both is the real USP of the film","label":0},{"review":"One of my favorite Bollywood movies ❤. If you haven't seen it you are not a Bollywood fan. Geet ( Kareena Kapoor Khan in movie) is my all time favorite movie character.
