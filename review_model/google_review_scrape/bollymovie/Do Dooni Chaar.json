[{"review":"Amazing movie any common man can relate to it. A sweet & simple story yet the challenges that middle class families go through and how they face those challenges is shown beautifully and try to stay happy inspite of it.\n\nJust reminded us of all the struggles that our parents had gone through to bring us up.\n\nTerrific story appealing to audience of all ages. Never get bored no matter how many ever times you see it.","label":0},{"review":"Amazing movie. Storyline direction was superb. Actors acting were real good. They have given us true message that middle class families like clerk teachers can't afford expensive gadgets, expensive clothes,  they can't eat in expensive restaurants etc. Because  they have other spending . In that case they do savings. For their children's future. And for their own future. Nice movie.  And now a days things are getting expensive .  In India 90 percent families are middle class .","label":0},{"review":"One of the most realistic movie that I have watched in recent times.
