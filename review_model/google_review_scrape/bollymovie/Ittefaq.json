BR Films , which has again co produced this remake with SRK‚Äôs Red Chillies entertainment and Karan Johar‚Äôs Dharma Production !! \n\nStarring Akshaye Khanna as the investigating officer Dev , who takes the charge of a double murder case in which he has to find out who among Siddharth Malhotra who plays an author Vikram and Sonakshi Sinha who plays Maya has committed the crime... or is it someone else??ü§î Well this genre of movie is quite unexplored and no one takes the risk of venturing out to make crime thrillers which can be engagingly gripping as well as entertaining with a strong script !! Abhay fairly succeeds in creating an excitingly entertaining movie which has many twists and turns till the very last minute !! This is primarily possible because of the excellent performance by Akshaye Khanna who has to be given full credit to pull off such a performance with his brooding and intense looks !! He‚Äôs got this amazing talent of being funny without even trying to move a funny bone... he‚Äôs quirkily funny in some scenes  !! Siddharth and Sonakshi does a descent job ... although one gets the feeling that Sonakshi was somehow under-utilised !! The editing by Nitin Baid was very interesting....as the way both Siddharth‚Äôs and Sonakshi‚Äôs version of how the murders happened are very nicely intertwined and it makes for an interesting watch. In such movies the background score has to be equally good and Tanishk Bagchi does a very good job in that !! \n\nAkshaye Khanna‚Äôs hunt for the murderer brings forward three aspects .... Siddharth‚Äôs version .... Sonakshi‚Äôs version and the third one being the TRUTH!! Is it intentional or is it all because of Coincidences?? ‚Äú Ittefaq ‚Äú is all about finding that TRUTH!! Since it is a murder mystery I would not like to spoil the suspense of the movie which is full of twists and turns and engaging till the very last minute!!! So my recommendation is to watch this movie as it‚Äôs a nice try of a new director trying a comparatively unexplored genre of crime thrillers!!! I also support their promotional campaign of ‚ÄúSay No to Spoilers‚Äú of not revealing who the actual murderer is !!! However waiting for it‚Äôs DVD or NETFLIX release will be too late as I am sure by that time the secret will be leaked out üòâ!!","label":0},{"review":"Rating - 2.5/5\nSomewhere in Mumbai, in the rainy night.

The famous London Based Novelist Vikram Sethi (Sidharth Malhotra) is running away from the police in his classy Mercedes Benz. While the cops chasing for Vikram there comes Maya (Sonakshi Sinha) wooooh banging into their Police Jeep.\n\nIttefaq, the most anticipated movie in Bollywood which is an adaptation of the movie by the same name which released in the late 60s starring Rajesh Khanna and Nanda. Well that movie was a remake of the classic Hollywood movie Sing post to Murder. But the Ittefaq starring Sid Malhotra and Sonakshi Sinha has a different plot.\n\nThe whodunit mystery starts here. Vikram, the best selling author isn‚Äôt that happy. Because his last release failed to impress the readers. And he‚Äôs in Mumbai along with his publisher wife Catherine (Kimberley Louisa McBeath), to launch his next book. Catherine is found dead and Vikram starts running and takes refugee at Maya‚Äôs house. But Maya has her own dark secrets ? In the later events Maya manages to reach the police and when the cops arrive at her apartment, Vikram is standing next to Maya‚Äôs Husband Shekar Sinha‚Äôs dead body.\n\nDev (Akshaye Khanna) is now in charge of the double murder mystery case. And he has just 3 days to crack the case. Now the two suspects Vikram and Maya have their own versions of the stories. According to Maya; Vikram killed his wife and he came to her house and then after certain events he killed Shekar. And In Vikram‚Äôs version ; He is running away from the police because of the false alarm of killing his wife. And takes the refuge at Maya‚Äôs house. Where he will find unusual things. And Maya plans the event and makes him fall to the police has a victim for killing Shekar. Will Dev ever be able to crack the case in just three days with the two perspectives ? Is it Maya who killed her husband ? Who Killed Catherine ? Or is it Vikram who killed the both ?\n\nAbhay Chopra‚Äôs directorial debut could have been hit if he had taken care of the screenplay a little interesting. This movie doesn‚Äôt have any songs just like the 60s Ittefaq. Michal Luka‚Äôs camera isn‚Äôt that great but the interiors makes the frame look alluring. The all time sleeping police, who needs chai even at the crime scene, the automated voice in the lift annoying Dev, and at one point the cop says ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre right, then there‚Äôs nothing wrong‚Äù bring some laughter. It‚Äôs Sonakshi Sinha who scores the best in acting along with the Akshaye Khanna.\n\nOverall Ittefaq tries your patience and it‚Äôs not that difficult to guess whodunit.","label":0},{"review":"A nail biting, edge of seat thriller, this movie may be a remake of 1969 film of same title but still maintains the tempo and interest.

This whodunit double murder revolves around a writer, his wife who gets murdered making her husband on the run, an  amorous housewife, her lover and a police detective who is bent upon to solve the murder in three days.\nThe interesting part of this fast paced movie is the story is entirely recounted  from the views of the suspects similar to Akira Kurosawa 's famous Roshomon movie and the detective is to arrive at the murderer from the evidence available and statements of suspects.\n Siddhartha Malhotra (writer in the movie) and Akshaye Khanna as calm and composed detective have done wonderfully while Sonakshi Sinha has given the support. The director needs to be complimented for his crisp direction though there are some potholes here and there. \nInteresting movie to watch.","label":0},{"review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!\nITTEFAQ: I would just like to say that the skeleton of the movie was really good, it was the flesh that I couldn't digest.\n\n2 major plot holes which could have made the ending so much better if acknowledged!!\n\n1.Overdosage found in the pills is evidence enough to reopen Katherine's case and to make Vikram a prime suspect for Katherine's murder.\n\n2.

Vikram only destroys the legal case papers in shekhar's briefcase. He is 100% likely to have a copy in his office. \n\nAlso it would have been too easy to just pull up relation between Katherine and Shekhar from call records, which should have been done. Even if the police were under pressure to close the case they did have enough time to call the suicide girl's father and that private detective.\n\nAlso, I feel it was unwise wasting scenes in futile car crashes and redundant dog scenes, I would have loved to see more about sonakshi's relation with her husband or maybe a bit more of Mandira bedi in the film.\n\nThere is enough evidence to call Vikram back from UK. Also his move to burn his wife's body before her friends n family could see her in UK makes him suspicious enough too.\n\nIt would have been very nice ending if after Mandira bedi made akshaye khanna realise the overdose part the next scene would be akshaye arresting Siddhartha at the airport explaining him his mistakes i.e. the above two plot holes.\n\nInstead of trying to put in content for the sake of it, writers in Bollywood should focus more on the believability of the plot and make it so that it's complexity upholds throughout. I wish someone would have pointed it out to the filmmakers at the scripting stage.","label":0},{"review":"Just watchable.

The unfolding of scenarios through the investigation of the two murders create intrigue and builds up the whodunit feel to some extent. Humour in the dialogues are a good relief. It‚Äôs however, dull in second half and doesn‚Äôt succeed as much in involving you in a gripping manner as it should, although it apparently had potential to be a great thriller. This is partly due to the performance of the lead cast as well as lack of intelligent investigation in the script. Several aspects are not investigated enough and depositions of the suspects is the key thread. The climax seems a bit implausible too as it doesn‚Äôt tie up well with the clues shown earlier. \n\nOf the cast, Akshay Khanna as the investigating officer does a decent job and Sidharth depicts a believable character. Sonakshi, though, doesn‚Äôt provide any depth. The actor who plays the havaldar impresses. Cinematography and background score are good for this genre. \n\nOverall, an average whodunit thriller with decent direction by a first time director. Better cast and actors could have lifted it few notches up.","label":0},{"review":"First of all - no item numbers or silly duets to break the narrative. Akshaye is top notch as a police officer.
