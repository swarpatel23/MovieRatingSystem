[{"review":"Lakshmi movie Review: AL Vijay if he makes a hit or a flop I watch all his movies for the reason he has so much of love and passion in film making and he is one who brings emotion on screen so well.

He has used \"DANCE\" as the main flavour to deliver in Lakshmi and who else other than Prabhu Deva can deliver the best that's the ground rule set in this film. Let's not go in deep whether it has good story and screenplay. Its a kids dance movie and when it comes to kids director AL Vijay is master piece in this subject. Ditya a school kid has DNA as dance and her mother hates dance and how did ditya succeed in dance is what the plot of story. All kids who performed in this movie is lovely. Go and enjoy for kids and if you are a big fan of dance. Prabhu Deva dance for 10 minutes in the movie is a highlight. Sofia as a dance coach has done well. As usual natural role artist Aishwarya Rajesh has performed so well as ditya mother. On the whole once again Vijay has done a great work. Do watch in theatre and enjoy. My rating is 3 out of 5.","label":0},{"review":"I watched this film in telugu version #LAKSHMI...I went to this film with very low expectations.

My opinion is that, for all the people who love dancing, for the parents who encourage  their kids dancing skills to grow it is a good movie.

All the drama factors which we see in the movie are already staged in the reality dancing shows in almost all regional channels in our country. (Spoiler alert : Deaf kid dancing with the mentor on the stage and people getting sympathy over that kid, dancing with bleeding on the stage etc etc..)  Of course all the child artists in this movie are the ones who already reached fame through the reality dance shows in India.\n\nIf you are a person who is already tired of watching the reality dance shows in the Tv better skip this movie..!\n\nIf you have some passion towards dance and want to enjoy purely the dancing factor irrespective of cinematic experience go for it.!","label":0},{"review":"Such a great and wonderful film to watch and enjoy.
