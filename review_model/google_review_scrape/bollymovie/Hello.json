Breaking my inhibited approach to regional cinema, 2018 kickstarted with this refreshingly entertaining Telugu film. Hello is a beautiful medley of a traditional love story woven into a modern outlook carefully presented with sensitive acting, crisp dialogues and astute direction. Akhil Akkineni (son of actors Nagarjuna and Amala) is a fresh breath of air Telugu cinema has ever witnessed. His second film as the lead, Akhil is a fine combination of good looks and intelligent acting reflecting his legendary lineage. \n\nThe storyline, despite being cliched, does not bear the brunt of deja vu as it has been treated with finesse by a talented team of writer-director (Vikram K Kumar) and actors Akhil Akkineni, Kalyani Priyadarshan, Ramya Krishnan and Jagapati Babu. Akhil (Srinu) is a street boy who befriends this girl (Kalyani Priyadarshan) at a gol gappa stall in his childhood. They bond well and she encourages him to play an original score on his ek tara. But destiny has other plans and the girl leaves the city for good. In the meantime, Akhil too meets his foster parents in Ramya Krishnan and Jagapati Babu and his life changes forever. However, 14 years later, both resolve to find each other come what may. \n\nInterspersed with nail-biting chases, fights and ‘’happy’’ coincidences a la Salman Khan style, the film engages you till the end.  The background score by Anup Rubens is noteworthy and adds to excitement of each chase. A far cry from the usual fare Hello is embellished beautifully with fine performances by all supported ably with a tight script. Ramya Krishnan is the heartstealer with sophisticated yet subtle acting as the doting mother. Her poignant scene where she is overjoyed to hear her foster son call her amma yet doesn’t want to make a big deal in front of him is touching. Hello is regional and yet global in its approach. Reflecting the changing tastes of audiences. Watch the film and you will say hello to only entertainment all the way till the end.","label":0},{"review":"Hello (Telugu): Punchy, impactful and soul stirring.
