Two examples- Ahalya and Kahaani. \nIf you are Bengali Hindu living in Kolkata, there's no way you don't know about Asuradalani Mahishasur Mardini Maa Durga. She killed demons for the sake of humanity's protection. The protagonist Vidya 'Bidda' Bagchi is Durga. \nThis movie is 5/5.","label":0},{"review":"A true story knitted well  and executed splendidly. The protagonist and the antagonist both make their presence felt especially the negative character . Indraniel Sengupta as the rogue black ops agent of IB shines in his role.  Supporting casts  support the film throughout. Watch it for a reasonable engaging story . Some of the scenes are worth engaging.

Kudos to Sujit Ghosh.","label":0},{"review":"Though she is not her own daughter , still saves her without giving up thinking nothing related to her , vidya puts her self in mini's shoe , understand the oppression she is going through\n\nVerily Allah has created something most beautiful if I had to say is women ,  as a mother , sister , wife and daughter , in my view a women is more capable than men in regards with raising their children , for this they sacrifice up to extent that men cannot even think about it .\n\nSeriously , this movie has v ...MORE","label":0},{"review":"Though she is not her own daughter , still saves her without giving up thinking nothing related to her , vidya puts her self in mini's shoe , understand the oppression she is going through\n\nVerily Allah has created something most beautiful if I had to say is women ,  as a mother , sister , wife and daughter , in my view a women is more capable than men in regards with raising their children , for this they sacrifice up to extent that men cannot even think about it .\n\nSeriously , this movie has very good to me, a raise hands up to heavens and supplication to Allah , that Vidya be healthy , successful in both worlds.","label":0},{"review":"Amazing movie .
