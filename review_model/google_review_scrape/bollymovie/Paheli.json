[{"review":"I don't know why it has been received poorly by film critics, but I find it to be an entertaining one. The story is known to most Indians, but I like how it has been given a different twist in the movie. The main characters have depth, and they are beautifully portrayed by SRK, Rani, Juhi, Anupam and else. The songs are beautiful, dresses are colourful, and AB's guest appearance is extra profit for us the audience.","label":0},{"review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Lacho and the ghost together but I feel bad for the real Kishan:(\n\nHe's been lonely for about 4 years and then when he came back he found out that there's this ghost who pretended to be him and stole his wife, even have child with his wife:( and in the end he can't even being his own self because (I assume) the ghost possesed his body.\n\nSad.","label":0},{"review":"The movie is so good and far ahead of it's time.
