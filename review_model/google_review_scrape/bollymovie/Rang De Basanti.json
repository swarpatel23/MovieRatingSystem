It instilled patriotism in me, which I had always lacked prior to watching this movie. I only wish Bollywood came up with more movies like this one. \n\nSome of the memorable, unforgettable quotes from the film (sort of spoiler alert for those who haven't seen it yet, but I can't help it) - \n\n--- Koi bhi Desh perfect nahi hota.. use perfect banana padta hai \n--- Ab bhi jiska khoon na khaula khoon nahi woh paani hai.. Jo Desh ke kaam na aaye woh bekar jawani hai\n--- Zindagi jeene ke bas do hi tarike hai.. Ek, jo ho raha hai hone do, bardasht karte jao ya fir zimmedari uthao use badalne ki\n\nP.S. Watched this again and writing this review on the day after the Pulwama terror attacks. Martyrs never die. Utmost Respect to their souls. No virtue, absolutely no virtue is greater than courage/bravery.

Yes, the movie does have it's technical flaws like poor editing and a few unnecessary scenes here and there. But the rest of the movie more than covers for it. From the flawless integration of the Indian freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad, to the main plot point of the movie, that is, the MiG plane incidents and the corrupt government, the entire story was so well thought of.\nDon't even get me started on the actinig performances in this movie. Of course the veterans like Anupam Kher, Kirron Kher and Om Puri were masterful. Aamir Khan, while being the most experienced and bigger in stardom than the rest of the cast, knows that he is but one cog in the wheel of this movie, and thus does not steal the spolight for himself and instead lets the story move forward. But the focus here is on the rest of the ensemble. This movie introduces two new faces - Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth Suryanarayan, although the latter was an established Tamil and Telugu actor. Even the newbies have done such a wonderful job. Also, Alice Patten, who plays an English director in this movie, plays the character so masterfully, again keeping her self-interests away and helping the bigger picture move forward.\nThe message in this movie is so clearly branded in the mind that the audience is left wondering whether they are really as good and patriotic as they put on to be.\nOverall, this movie is certainly a benchmark in Bollywood, one which can only be reached or exceeded by thinkers like Aamir and others.","label":0},{"review":"I watched this movie last night.
