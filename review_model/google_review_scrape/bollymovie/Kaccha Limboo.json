Story revolves around a 13 year boy named Shambu. Obsesssed by his classmates, his mother and his step-father, he decided to leave all the things and cycled towards a new life. The movie narrates his embarked journey with a slum boy who once tried to stole his cycle. The bond that both shares is the most lovely thing and the most strongest once. However I was disappointed with the end as it let me wonder about the slum boy and how Shambu was back at home.\nIn the end I would like to say that it's a bumpy and emotional ride.\nA treat to all the kids and a lesson to all the tenagers.\nI will go with 4 stars. And will give 85% rotten tomatoes.\nRate-****","label":0},{"review":"I think this movie do great work for society .and I also support the acting of armaan Malik .he is looking so cute in this movie .I think that armaan' s acting was .😂😂😍😍😍 very fine","label":0},{"review":"Awsm movie specially...armaan's song ..jab ye sitaare love u armaan ....💖❤️❤️💖...but I m not getting this movie on utube...","label":0},{"review":"Armaan is very telented.armaan is best in the world for me.I love him verymuch😘😙😙","label":0},{"review":"This movie is a very emotional and motivational. 🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅","label":0},{"review":"I think it is best movie in world","label":0},{"review":"Did not understand the storyline of this film","label":0},{"review":"Nothing interested","label":0},{"review":"Grt performance.. original n refreshing","label":0}]
