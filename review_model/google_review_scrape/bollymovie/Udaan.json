Similarly, when the content is powerful, we have seen filmmakers down play either Music or screenplay or something that reminds us that we are watching a movie. Udaan is one of those rare movies which keeps you glued even when you already guessed the end of the movie in the first 30 minutes. \n\nThat's Captivating ! \nProbably, the first film set in jamshedpur, this film is not about any social message on child abuse. This film is more about how to explore creative freedom, break barriers and explore freedom. Great direction, great acting and fantastic music too. Must watch...\n\nInshort, It is a visual poem about poems :)","label":0},{"review":"Get out of the nutshell even if it's been created by your parents itself. live your life to the fullest. Ram Kapoor and rohan character played actor did wonderful. The climax made me \"think\". Bollywood has the potential to do such films amazed me. Vikramaditya directorial is awesome.

Finally it turned out to that the abuse itself was the inspiration. There is no message in this movie other than not to tolerate parental abuse. At best it will motivate kids to run away from abusive parents \nThat said, the performances of  the characters are outstanding.Ronit Roy simply rocks as the abusive single father.The movie is worth a dekho, nothing more","label":0},{"review":"It was an outstanding movie and very emotional movie.

There is nothing in this movie to be rated high except for the acting which is very good.
