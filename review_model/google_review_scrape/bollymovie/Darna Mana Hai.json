For the time being they sit in a house-like place and starts reciting spooky stories to each other. Things get mysterious when each of them starts disappearing.\n\nWhat's Good: It is terrifying in contrary to Indian horror movies. Some tales like Ghostly Lift and No Smoking and other stories plot also is a good thing to see. Brilliant acting portrayed by everyone and almost every story takes you to the edge of your seat. And you don't expect horror movies giving message!\n\nWhat's Bad: Stop/Move story is really slow and is stupid at some point. Apples story lacks in content and the ending seems all rushed up.\n\nLoo Break: None.\n\nReview: Darna Mana Hai is a fine movie and terrifyingly terrifying.\n\nTo Watch or Not To Watch: It is scary enough to watch.\n\n                                                                                                                                                A HASAN'S REVIEW","label":0},{"review":"A enjoyable horror movie.

It reminds me of another horror movie of a similar name structured in a similar format but the stories between the two movies are completely different ...MORE","label":0},{"review":"A enjoyable horror movie.
