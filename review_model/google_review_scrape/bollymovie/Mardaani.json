In the film Rani Mukharjee essays the role of Shivani Shivaji Roy a dare devil cop \nwho elegantly juggles her professional career and personal life, things are normal untill a teenage \ngirl named Pyaari whom she treats like her own niece goes missing from a shelter home. Determined to \ncrack down the case Shivani Roy starts investigating the matter and succesfully bursts a racquet that \nis involved in Kidnapping teenage girls and pushing them into flesh trade, surprisingly Karan Rastogi \nalias Walt (Tahir Raj Basin) the kingpin who runs the sex trafficking buisness in an organized manner \nis in his mid twenties and is seen threatening the victim in English, usually people in our country \ndon’t expect criminals and masterminds of anti social activities to be elitish,Karan Rastogi(Tahir Raj \nBhasin) and his close aides look like actors who are suitable to be in films based on college life. \nBut if we think that it is a casting error them we are wrong, we need to understand that times have \nchanged, gone are the days when children of criminals were school dropouts like their parents, the \ncharacter, Karan Rastogi is a second generation criminal who has the backing of his evil minded mother, \nManju Rastogi, who is a veteran in the business. Rani and Tahir Raj Bhasin have done a great job, as I \ndidn’t have much information about Tahir, I went through his profile which states that he has taken \nrigourous training in body language and behavioural analytics at the Institute of Advanced Acting and \nBehavioural Studies and trust me his academical knowledge came handy, his body language and gestures \nwere too good.\nThe filmmakers deserve a compliment for touching a sensitive subject, people from all classes go to \nred light areas, permit rooms and dance bars for sexual pleasure but nobody cares to know from where \nthese girls are brought in for their service,the common answer that these girls give is helplessness \n(Majboori) but it is hard to believe that all the prostitutes have landed in the trade due to financial \nproblem.\nRani Mukharjee’s role has the potential to inspire millions of women who feel insecured in this male \ndominated society, however her foul language raises concern and I hope it does not become part of the \nWomen’s empowerment curriculam because be it male or female abusive language doesn’t go well with \nanybody’s personality.","label":0},{"review":"Right from the start we know who is the rapist. We know Rani is the hero and its any one's guess that Rani will catch him in the end. The movie wasnt thrilling enough. Also, the scenes where the villain speaks into the camera didnt work for me. The boy didn't look menacing or creepy to make my blood boil. The attempts of showing grotesque Dexter-like crime scenes may be new for Indian masses. Overall, this movie could have been so much better as it touched upon a socially relevant topic. But it  ...MORE","label":0},{"review":"Right from the start we know who is the rapist.

Rani fans won't be disappointed as she has delivered a neat performance.","label":0},{"review":"It's a must watch movie. It shows the fighter that is hidden within a girl. If every girl understand this thing, they should not be afraid to walk in the streets like men at night. They must not feel bad about their gender. And kudos to Rani Mukerji mam. She was awesome, whenever you see her on screen we could feel that we are bold and we are to achieve our goals. She did justice to her role.

The beating scene of karan and last scene gave a great message to the audience like me. Totally the movie was worth watching.","label":0},{"review":"Great movie.... scary at times as one realizes the lurking dangers for a girl child. Rani Mukerji gives a gritty performance as a committed police officer. Reminded me of another pocket-sized actor... Aamir Khan in Sarfaroz, who was equally believable and effective. These 2 movies are my favourite cop movies.","label":0},{"review":"It's a must watch movie. Maybe for some people  it maybe the same story line or same direction and stuff.

It can be seen for the strong acting by the lead heroine and the villain.Debut  vishal has done full justice to his role .Though plot of the movie is similar to ashutosh rana \"Dushman\",Imran hashmi\"Murder2 \", siddharth malhotra\"Ek tha villain\",but can be seen once .one thing is not clear in the movie,that how the villain became so dangerous,after his mother was killed by his father,he went to jail.after that who takes the care of the young villain in meerut?","label":0},{"review":"Rani Mukherji is back with her action flick. The movie is based on a psycho who deals with child trafficking and drugs and how senior inspector Shivani Shivani Roy (Rani Mukherji) tracks him down. What follows is a cat and mouse game.
