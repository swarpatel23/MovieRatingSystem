[{"review":"Interesting story with lot of good performances specially irfan khan who gave one of the best performances of his life. Story deals with university politics, crime, power, love and inner conflicts. Only negative point is unnecessarily inserted songs which sometimes break the flow, but as you would be watching it online you can always skip songs.","label":0},{"review":"This is one of the best movie i have ever seen after maqbool. ashutosh rana dominated all other by his acting skills though he had a small role but yet he did a splendid job. while irrfan is always marvellous.","label":0},{"review":"Incidentally I watched this movie first day, first show.
