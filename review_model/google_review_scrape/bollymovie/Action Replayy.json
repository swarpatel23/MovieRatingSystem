[{"review":"This movie has it's own pace and it's like an old wine. The more you watch it, the more you start loving it. Indeed, it's one of the highly underrated movies of our time. It manages to show you the old world charm. Both Akshay Kumar and Aishwarya Rai portrayed the characters effortlessly and their on-screen chemistry in the film is delightful. Mr Vipul Shah has once again done great job.","label":0},{"review":"Very underrated movie, its a treat for eyes, full of humor and interesting lively pop-songs, the costumes and era of 70s shown beautifully. A very interesting blend of past and present, humor and emotions. It's a light mood movie with lots of innocence. Akshay kumar, Aishwarya and Om Pori are true legends.","label":0},{"review":"Pretty underrated imo.It's an entertaining rom com and manages to give some laughs every time you watch it.One should not look into the logical rational basis of the movie and enjoy it for what it is.\nBetter than most comdey films produced in Bollywood","label":0},{"review":"ITS A COMPLETE COPY OF THE CLASSIC \"BACK TO THE FUTURE\" 1985.
