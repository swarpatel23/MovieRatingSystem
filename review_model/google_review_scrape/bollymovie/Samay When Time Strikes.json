[{"review":"An under-rated film.It maintains suspense till the very end as everyone thinks that the antagonist(serial killer) is going to kill the singer but something else end up happening due to the mistake made by the cop earlier in the story.Even though he is killed at the end by the cop but he still wins as he is able to convince her to kill him.Overall, a must watch movie.","label":0},{"review":"One of the very few true thrillers of bollywood.
