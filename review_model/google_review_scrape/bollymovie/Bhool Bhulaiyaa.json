You can watched over hundred times but you can't boar. Although it was remake of Malayalam movie Manichitrathazhu (1993) starring Mohanlal and Chandramukhi (2005) starring Rajnikant; it was more entertaining & good than originals. In childhood I was too much scared 'manjulika'....","label":0},{"review":"It is a wonderful film.Akshaykumar ,vidhya balan and all other actors do their jobs 100 percentage well.But some of them are saying this movie is better than its original.it is wrong.This movie is technically better but watch it's original version in malayalam (plz don't in Tamil they destroyed it.) 'Manichithrathazhu' starting Mohanlal , Suresh Gopi,Shobhana and directed by fazil .It's so natural and watch the amazing acting of Mohanlal and Shobana","label":0},{"review":"Amazing scarey movie. Storyline direction was very good of this movie . Actors acting were real good speciallys vidiya balans  ghost acting was very scarey and too good.  When I watch this movie in television I can't able to sleep at night properly.  It has been shooted in  Raj palace hotel jaipur in Rajasthan.  Nice movie. Her character was a mad person .
