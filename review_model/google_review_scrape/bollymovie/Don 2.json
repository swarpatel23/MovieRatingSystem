This movie is really comparable to hollywood with very good  screenplay, acting and action. I suggest you to watch this movie if you are a fan of crime thrillers. Also shahrukh and priyanka are very best as always, they are the representative of bollywood in the international audience.","label":0},{"review":"It's  a complete stylized action thriller  movie.
