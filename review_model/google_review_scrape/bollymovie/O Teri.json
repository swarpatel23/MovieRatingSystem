[{"review":"I watched O Teri on TV last evening without ever having heard of it and without much expectation.\n\nTo my surprise it turned out to be a laugh worthy slapstick movie, most suitable to watch at night just before you go to bed.  \n\nVijay Raaz performance was the best, he is such an under rated actor.  I do hope he gets his due recognition - he was great in Pataakha too.  Salman Khan appears only in the song video at the end.","label":0},{"review":"Nice movie!
