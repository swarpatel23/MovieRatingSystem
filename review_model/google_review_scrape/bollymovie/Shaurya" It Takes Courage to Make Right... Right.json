[{"review":"I can never forget the climax, the very final scene from the movie, where Brigadier Rudra Pratap Singh, in the heat of the moment, confessess his part in the mishaps and how he blames of the horrible horrible things that one person did to his family to the whole community.

But what struck me the most was when he got up and started behaving as if he said nothing, as if he did nothing wrong, as if didn't just confessed his wrong, rather told a story of his bravery and valour. It was unsettling and disturbing and yet I didn't feel anger, rather I felt sorry for the man, who once had a good enough heart to keep a 10year old orphan muslim guy in his home, was now untouched by the thought of killing a six year old muslim girl. The man who himself lost a daughter so brutally, got so cold that such a thought even didn't send chills down his spine. Everyone grows up and gets mature and wise but the day someone looses the last bit of innocence, nothing can be worse than that.","label":0},{"review":"Must say it's a one sided movie, wrong depiction of our Army. \nA fact - one section of people will surely love it, from the reviews you can figure out which one.

Intense actingðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ.\n\nNo offence but it was a one sided movie with the whole motive to prove Javed khan innocent(lazy writing). Poor storyline and also felt it was kind of trying to defame Indian Army with communalism-could have handled this much better!!!\n\nOverall-6/10.\nSongs-lame\nKashmir visuals- could have shown more but still breathtaking.\nStory line- average.","label":0},{"review":"A nice movie with good story!

They are the same people who falsely try to project hardcore terrorists pelting stones at Indian army vehicles as misguided youth.","label":0},{"review":"The way in which Indian Army was depicted here, was a total insult to all of the people serving the nation. Not taking away from the fact that there may be chances of such officers serving in the army and we are not totally aware of the situation they go through on Indian border, but just ridiculing the Pride of them by showing them as mass murderers of people belonging to Muslim community, is totally wrong. Loved Kay Kay Menon and Rahul Bose in this.","label":0},{"review":"Apart from KK menon, the movie don't has much to offer by it's supporting caste. Deepak dobriyal is good in the limited and constrained role. Javed jafrie could have been replaced by a mature looking actor. Rahul Bose is not up to the expectations. The journalist is extremely annoying and bubbly type for such an area.\n2.5*/5","label":0},{"review":"Movie are realistic some time we can't judge officers likes Rathor . Indian education have to be sure learn our officers respect human being .If a group of people army tent in your town & different type of thinking person present in this group or they do something wrong we can't forget these moments & anger will come in local people .I think same are happen in Kashmir.","label":0},{"review":"Obviously deepak dobriyal did his job and that was brilliant. But I like this movie because of k.k. menon's act, specially the climax court room scene.  K.K. Menon and Deepak Dobriyal are superb, but rest of the main characters r not so charming.","label":0},{"review":"Superb.  K k Menon is incomparable. His skills as an actor are supreme    And Bose vid Minisha are also superb.  Dobriyal is so talented.   Fantastic storyline","label":0},{"review":"Such wacky picture it was..

Horribly biased and attempt to defame army.\n\nQuestion to ask is why is that always a Muslim is depicted as the most pious and honest person? Is Bollywood trying to send a message or attempting for subtle brainwashing?","label":0},{"review":"A good movie. Kay Kay Menon at his best. The other actors didnt quite suit to the army role. Better actors selection could have taken this movie to new heights.","label":0},{"review":"A Bollywood remake of 'A Few Good Men', with borrowed plot undertones from the Hindi play 'Court Martial'. Stellar acting by Deepak Dobriyal, some fine moments by Kay Kay Menon, and Rahul Bose. Definitely worth a watch.","label":0},{"review":"What a movie !\nThroughroly got moved and inspired,\nall BJP bhakths should watch this to get some humanity into their heads.\nNot only governace even the army should have ethics of human values !","label":0},{"review":"It's the fact.

The acting of KK Menon is too good. Just loved it.","label":0},{"review":"An extremely poor copy of a Hollywood gem. \nThis movie is made in extremely poor taste and is rendered completely unwatchable by Bose's pathetic overacting.\nAm update uninspired attempt at copycatting. \nNot recommended.","label":0}]
