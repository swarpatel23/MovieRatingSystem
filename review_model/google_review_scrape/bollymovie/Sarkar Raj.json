[{"review":"Well crafted and aptly acted by all . Ishould mention here of Abhishek who pulled off his part brilliantly. He shines in some of the edging scenes . Amitabh Sir is always a top of the line actor . I appeal to audience to see Family :Ties of Blood where he acted as a brutal Chieftain . He stands out amongst all. Villains in Sarkar Raj are worth watching . Aishwarya is a star . She should go for more of these sort of roles. Rest assured. An honest approach for a vigilante genre .üëç","label":0},{"review":"Best of the series followed by part 1 and the worst flop part 3. \nSarkar 2 is a must watch. After this movie the storyline of sarkar 3 is a dead give away.","label":0},{"review":"Such a wonderful story ...
