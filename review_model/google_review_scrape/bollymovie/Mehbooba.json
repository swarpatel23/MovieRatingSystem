Special mention needed to Sandeep chowta , all the songs were good and background was also good. Aakash puri , there is lot to go brother and you look more younger for this role and female lead ,look beautiful .

Yet another illogical, routine tollywood movie","label":0},{"review":"Story is so nice but execution is not like puri sir type..
