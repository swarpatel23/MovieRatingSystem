Henry, in which the heroine knows she will die when the last leaf falls, so the hero paints and ties paper leaves on the tree until he can do so no more. The music by Amit Trivedi, including hits such as ‚ÄòSawaar Loon‚Äô/‚ÄòI‚Äôll Decorate My Heart‚Äô, evoke the 1950s and the golden age of Hindi film music.\nI think it is by far the best work of sonakshi sinha. She's extremely talented and natural in her acting skills.\n\nI just love the movie","label":0},{"review":"A masterpiece by Vikramaditya Motwane. We often get someone in life who teaches us to live again. We don't have to regret for that last leaf to fall, we can always wait for the monsoon to arrive again. I can clearly remember the last scene when Pakhi is sleeping in Varun's arms, like she is sleeping peacefully after a long time. And then Varun gets up and starts to leave. His eyes were still at Pakhi. That heart wrenching visual of seeing your loved one, for the last time, by making her learn to ...MORE","label":0},{"review":"A masterpiece by Vikramaditya Motwane.

The film capture the great  scenic beauty of Dalhousie an the era of 1950's.\n\nEssentially it was a heroine driven movie and Sonakshi Sinha is not disappointing at all.

Henry. Well, one of the best thing of the film is Ranveer's \"not-so-good\" boy look and his fab acting skills followed by the superhit songs - Sawar loon & Zinda. Also, the decent Bengoli aspect, which preety much suits sonakshi, is very fascinating. I like the film to a great extent.‚ò∫Ô∏è","label":0},{"review":"Outstanding movie.

The Story we can digest because it is much simpler. But the movie has an incomplete love story, hero's betrayal and much more which makes the overall movie very sad and depressing.
