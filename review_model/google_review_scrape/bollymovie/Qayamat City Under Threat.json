Should have been rated above 7.5. The comic element in a fabric of nationalism through which peeps the serene light of love, has given it a special touch. From any angle the movie is a success in terms of artistry.\n\nThank you.","label":0},{"review":"On of great movie of aj.. All time superb  song!!
