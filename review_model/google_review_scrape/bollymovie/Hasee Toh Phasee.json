[{"review":"One of the best movies to come out of Dharma. A nice feel good rom-com with many many good moments... Ad film maker Vinil Matthew's feature film debut is brimming with expertise of catching character nuances and perfect reactions from its talented star cast. It's unconventional yet familiar... slightly over the top characterisation yet rooted in the reality of modern times' interpersonal relationships.","label":0},{"review":"One of the best movie of all time.
