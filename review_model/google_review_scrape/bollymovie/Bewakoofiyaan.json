That's why and because it wasn't marketed well back in 2014, that's why didn't collect the numbers at the box office, if it releases now in 2019, then seeing Ayushman's last 7 hits ,last being Bala, then this movie would have worked. This movie collection was sabotaged because of Queen releasing a week before and because it wasn't marketed well by YRF. They came with a hiddengem but didn't sell it well enough.Also it didn't work because when you see the trailer and in parts Rishi Kapoor has given an over the top performance ,should learn from Nawazuddin Siddiqui,he said sometimes a dialouge needs 5% effort, \nthen other 95% is not required, because of Rishi Kapoor's over the top performance in parts and good performance overall, though, the trailer was borring, hence there wasn't excitement for this novie , else it could have been atlwast a sleeper hit.","label":0},{"review":"It is a beautiful movie but very less recognition from the audience as because of Queen movie got released at the same week when this movie released.
