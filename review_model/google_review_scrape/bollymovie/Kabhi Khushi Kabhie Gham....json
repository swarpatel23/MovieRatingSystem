So romance will easily happen. This is a good movie but the film was quite long 2 hours 45 min approximately. All the songs are really very good.

Sharukhan  plays his character lovely. Kajol is very nice in humour sense. Especially hrithik and kareena is very charming and so good looking. They played their role very well. Hrithik roshan dance is as usually good. Sentiment, comedy is mind blowing.","label":0},{"review":"Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham is one of the most accomplishments of Karan Johar . He deftly handles all the comic scenes in general and emotional scenes in particular. The Scene where Shahrukh took the decision to marry Kajol, first encounter between Shahrukh and Hrithik is astounding. The epitome of emotion is displ in last conclusive climax which is heart -moving. Amitabh Sir sparkles in the scene . All the casts delivered their respective parts well.

From legends like Amitabh and Jaya Buchchan, to Mega stars like Shahrukh Khan, Hritik Roshan, Kajol, Kareena Kapoor, and Rani Mukherjee it just too good. And all the hype surrounding it. Plus the music was another great factor. Title track, Bole chudiyan and Suraj Hua. Thanks.","label":0},{"review":"A family movie like this was never made and can never be made! Every scene in which SRK is featured is worth to shed a tear drop! Class and splendid performances by all the actors.
