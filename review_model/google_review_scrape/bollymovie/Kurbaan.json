[{"review":"What a wonderful Movie.\nSpoiler Alert!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transition from being cheesy for initial 10 to 15 mins it smoothly shifts to the main theme. The twists and suspense moments will always keep you on the edge of your seat. I know its a pretty old movie but still it was one of the best movies that I have ever watched till date.","label":0},{"review":"Good plot.! Except 10-15 mins of cheesy romance, movie was throughout entertaining with a strong message.!! Good storyline , acting is pretty good too, with quite a few twists and turns which I personally like in movies,! Watch it on Netflix, if u like such genre.!! N yes, pretty underrated movie with just 4.5 /10 on IMDb, which I wonder why.!!!","label":0},{"review":"A real roler-coaster of emotions with unexpected plot twists and an unbiased, fresh approach to the subject of terrorism and Muslim extremists. I love the fact that we got to see a Muslim character trying to stop a terror attack and the factors and circumstances that created such a ruthless killer in the first place. Really amazing.","label":0},{"review":"kareena is my favourite and i like all her movies .. this is also one of them .. the concept of the movie is common yet uniquely projected .. ossum movie .. must watch","label":0},{"review":"Really underrated film.
