[{"review":"A boy in his 20s taken unseriously to become a man with a positive influence of his new roommate. If you are stuck in your life, especially as a college student, this might be the movie for you. \n\nNot the best in terms of Ranbir's thought provoking choice of stories but it does make one wonder about where they are in their life. I think it was an average movie of the time(2009). Believable, up to date and fun.\n\nPS: Konkona had a powerful aura as an independent goal driven woman.","label":0},{"review":"This is movie is just great !!!
