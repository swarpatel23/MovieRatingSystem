I feel very bad for Veronica. We all know what it's like to be lonely and left for a characteristic of ours. This movie exploits that. Though it doesn't show it directly. The feelings put on by Deepika! No wonder she's one of the best actors in India. She deserves it. This one is for her.","label":0},{"review":"This film is about our mind,our thoughts about love which is very very complicated. But the film is nothing but a stress remover. Very entertaining.
