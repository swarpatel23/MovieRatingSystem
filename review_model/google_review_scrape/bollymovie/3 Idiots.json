Mazaa masti romance tragedy humour means wholesale masala by genius Aamir saab & wise Raju sir .Raju is a fantastic director, his expression method of a story telling with humour is really outstanding extraordinary  .The masterpiece. U can see observe clearly in pk as in same with favourable message.  Many msgs lies herein. It's based on our ednl system through well-known  novel of chetanjee Five point someone. Aamirkhan said only 5 p.c. similarities with this novel.\n\nNever pressurise students to opt out as ur choice  but should be given right to choose their own edn-career  destination. Attention parents and teachers!!! Wrong decision may lead harm both physically and mentally  2 ur child. It's very mandatory lesson  for all of us. 3 idiots taught us this impt msg.    In my life,  parents forced me to study in Arts (intermediation).Then Economics Hons  (graduation). I compromised with my dream edn for parental advice blindly. My wish was intermediation  in commerce , then Graduation in English Hons,  but foundation smashed out.  As a result,  although 62 p.c. in Arts  but collapsed  4 Eco Hons (disliking subject), aggregate  marks  just 41p.c.Hons just 31 p.c (without hons).my all efforts times  went on Eco , very less time  saved 4 my fvt language literature.  Then parents said 2 MBA. But I answered big no undoubtedly. First time I realised  never compromise with  own dream-edn. Today I've built up my career as per own will.Formal higher-edn ,certificate is valueless 4 me.I've been already a writer poet social activist Astrologist Palmist psychologist spiritualist and huge AAMIRIAN in  my own way.This is my own original track .I don't want atall to compromise anymore. Meanwhile now I've firmly mindset \n\nSimilarly parents punished me for not doing homework, study properly, criticized  me in childhood.couldn't arrange  well atmosphere  based school  for their outlookless though they were educated Doctor Economist respectively. It is not meant that I've no love to them .sometimes extra hope optimist nature  may spoil  career  and mental growth of ur child , I meaned that .my personal experience. \n\nLove ,smile, mix,realise student's wish of brain as a intimate friend lovely. It's most vast thing atleast now-a-days.\n\nZindagi jeene ka maxad mukamal ho gaya.My appeal every human should watch atleast once in life ( mr.passionate  aamirsir's wonderful gift  3idiots).l watched 21 times till date  All memorable dialogues've stored  in my brain forever. Cinematography, visual quality  is so nice  to watch on screen, eyethrilling.mindblowing   spot  like shimla Ladakh. Music is well touched  specially \"Aal izz well\". Personally  've  tryed so many times A I W like Rancho at my troubled circumstances;  it functioned so amazingly , believe me truly. Something courage  supplier to  fight out issues.\nRancho studied 4 pleasure satisfaction  knowledge, building machines rather than achieve degree certificate job money life style . \"Don't run after success,success 'll run automatically after  you \". This quote is appropriate  4 Rancho vs chatur .Rancho invented  a power inverter and utilised through car battery  during unfavourable condition like labour pain . Engineers delivered smartly .so, practical knowledge is greater than book knowledge  & appropriates  4  Rancho vs biru  \"why astronauts didn't use pencils in space ?\"  Ultimately prize pen of teacher went into Rancho's pocket .This picture reminds us pure friendships bond. My desire is have'nt any Rancho farhan raju in study days.Unfulfillment. \n\n\nRancho character is  well similarities  with Aamirsir in many ways in real .\n\nBy th by, AAMIRKHAN SIR TOUCHED LIVINGLY THE COLLEGE BOY ROLE AT 44  .ALL MY LOVE RESPECT  THANX TO \"AAMIRKHAN SIR\" LARGELY...LET'S ENJOY.

It takes the first trust with the mandatory ragging session  which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.\n\nSo, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.\n\nThe high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humour and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic `humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.\n\nAmongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule length of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as `Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well. Rush for it","label":0},{"review":"3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it...

Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to \"Five Point Someone\", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...\n\nBoth humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...\n\nTechnically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...\n\nComing to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good.","label":0},{"review":"How so sweet very fantastic movies\nEntertainment meng tip class, no doubt. \n\nFor young students who got inspired, impresses or carried away by \"Rancho\" character.....And Raju, Darshan.....Some missing links to remember. \n\n1.
