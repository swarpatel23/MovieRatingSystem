The best thing about this was that Even tho Diya wasn't sure about the show, she didn't reveal that to her team. She kept going and didn't stop. And at the end it resulted in immense happiness and Joy for entire Shamli! ❤ The positivity in the movie made me immensely Fascinated! 😊 Loved it!","label":0},{"review":"Oh my God.
