The movie is overall an OK direction suggesting and surrounding about pets.... The acting is definitely superb but the plot could have been strengthened... At the middle of the movie it grew to be boring but the finishing was great.... As it says all's well that ends well... So it is a must watch film that gives u a good impact... I give it a 3.5/5","label":0},{"review":"Very,very beautiful! Entertainment,songs are very good! Emotional and fantastic movie!
