After I watched it, I'am become the biggest fan for this film. Hrithik is stunning and charming. Abhishek is really good . Aishwarya rai performance is very nice.  Uday chopra is as usual given his best. His performance in humour sense is nice. Especially,  the  bank robbery  scene  is fantastic.  And  the 'dhoom machale ' song is rocking.  A fantastic  film . Everyone can watch this and enjoy this .","label":0},{"review":"Amazing movie. One of my favourite movie too. Storyline direction was awesome. VFX quality were superb. Actors acting were real good. I have enjoyed this series but Dhoom 3 I didn't like it much because in Dhoom 1 2004 and this dhoom2 is far better because  stealing story was there . and in Dhoom 3 only entertaining cum stunt scene was there a lot that's why I didn't like this movie. But Dhoom 2 I led very much. Songs are  cool. Nice movie.","label":0},{"review":"Hirithik roshan is the best thing in the film. Abishek and uday did a great job. Awesome time pass.
