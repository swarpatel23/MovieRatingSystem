[{"review":"The most interesting part of this movie is Aftab Shivdani's acting surprisingly good.\nCast- Aftab, Tia bajpai, Sharad Kelkar, and others.\nReview- It comes under same genra possessing and love triangle. But Tia Bajpai's acting was really good. The first half is bit slow but second not bad. Some thrilling moments, some scary moments, good songs all are in second half.\nConclusion-1920 evil returns is not as bad. One time watch able only becoz the second half has some interesting moments..","label":0},{"review":"One of the best horror movie I have ever seen..... Tia bajpai is my favorite actress... In this movie I found real love.... It was horrible and beautiful.... The story of the film was outstanding.....","label":0},{"review":"Plot was extremely weak and cringe-worthy. It didn't feel original or scary at all. It seemed like a cheap rip off of the original 1920 movie, which it was. I had the feeling that this movie was written and directed by an immature 5th grader.","label":0},{"review":"Good story.
