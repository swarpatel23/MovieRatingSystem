[{"review":"This movie could have been a good erotic suspense drama but the cast ruined everything. Lead actors were biggest disaster. Story was fine, shoot location was a good choice, somehow Arijit keeps us loving this movie but rest of the stars still needs to learn acting. Directions by Vivek Agnihotri is a real drawback of this perfectly written story.","label":0},{"review":"This film was not up to the mark although it has a very promising story that could have been acted in a better way.. with higher paid actors, but the collection of songs is the only thing that made the movie an overall must watch. You'll not be extremely satisfied after watching it or you may not even continue watching after a time, but the songs will definitely hold your mind for a long time afterwards..","label":0},{"review":"I feel like Zid had the potential to become one of the best erotic/suspense/murder mystery thrillers if it had got better actors. Too many plot holes ruined it but whoever the writer(s) was, they had a really good idea. Not bad.","label":0},{"review":"\"ZID\" is an average movie.
