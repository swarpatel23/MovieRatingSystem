[{"review":"It's an underrated gem of a movie.  So realistic rom com with tons of comedy and serious perspective to friendship and love as well.  \nUnlike other rom coms where the leads are so perfect,  this movies lead is soo human that he keeps making not one or two but series of mistakes throughout the whole movie.  He does everything wrong and yet is forgiven because thats what love and friendship is all bout.  \nMake mistakes and correct them and keep going ‚ù£‚ù£","label":0},{"review":"This is my no.1 favorite movie in my movie collection.Songs are so lovely and also gets funny n romantic touch üòÇ .
