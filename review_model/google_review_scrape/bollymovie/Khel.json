[{"review":"It's a high end comedy not intended for masses. Copied from dirty rotten scoundrels in a bad way with an ample dosage of drama and Manmohan desai masala, this film grown on you subtly. And that's good good because trying nothing over it will ruin the experience of comedy.. all acting all refinements checks done. Must watch for all coming of age comedy movies of early nineties.","label":0},{"review":"Shameful film! Almost everything about the film is pathetic.
