But when in 2006 lage raho munna bhai released when sanjay dutt was talking with jimmy shergal about his father shri sunil dutt ji passes away that he wants to say something to him that night but in next morning he died to cardiac arrest . Yes I have still remember in each and every news channels news was spread that famous politician and actor sunil dutt pass away it was in year 2005  in regional channels they were showing gun salute was giving to him and sanjay dutt and his sisters were crying every bollywood stars were present  from starting abhishek bachan , shahrukh khan, salman khan, aamir khan , akshay kumar, pretty zinta ,  javed akhtar etc bollywood stars were present.","label":0},{"review":"This movie is one of its kind.
