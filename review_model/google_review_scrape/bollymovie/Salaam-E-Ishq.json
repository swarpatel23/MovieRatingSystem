[{"review":"One of the best movies of it's time. Each and every story of the movie shows a different aspect of every bodies life. This movie from 2007 can prove that Salman Khan could act then. Govinda's charecter defines that he can't only joke around but play the serious roles equally well. Anil Kapoor role defined the middle aged men dilemma pretty well. \n\nAll in all one of the best movies.","label":0},{"review":"I'm watching dis movie first tym in mah life in 2019 & its about 5:30 am .... i cant explain my words how much i love it...
