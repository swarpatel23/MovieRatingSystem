[{"review":"Housefull 2 is a fantastic movie. It was so interesting. I can't control myself. Because this movie is full of comedy from first to end. Akshay Kumar, john Abraham, rithesh desmukh is really awesome. But I don't know the 4th hero, but his acting is nice. My favorite hero is rithesh desmukh. He is a best comedian. The third part of this movie is super. But , the best is second part. This is a family entertaining movie. The best movie I have ever seen. üòçüòçüòçüòç","label":0},{"review":"Nice movie with nice comic timings of the actors . Both Rishi Kapoor and Randhir Kapoor were superb in their own ways .
