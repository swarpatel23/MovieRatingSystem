No unnecessary love tracks, forced comedy or songs: just purely smart, impressive, intriguing storytelling. You can't afford to miss any detail in this high-concept action thriller that is complex and yet not complicated to understand.\n\nAkshay Kumar delivers an outstanding performance, and Javed Jaffrey also entertains with his subtle comic timing. Ayesha Takia is impressive as well. The story revolves around a limited set of characters but that doesn't stop it from being captivating. It's packed with high-octane action sequences and edge-of-the-seat thrills. Visual effects are also quite top notch. \n\nThat being said, 8 X 10 Tasveer is not your typical Bollywood film. It's an out-and-out action thriller that feels like an international film as it entertains without compromising on quality. I'd love to collect it, as the stunts and twists have really left me impressed more than any Akshay Kumar film I have seen till date. Nagesh Kukunoor's first attempt at making an action thriller is so successful that I wish to see more of his works in this genre.\n\n10/10.","label":0},{"review":"Very well written, however poorly executed in terms of editing and directing. Even though we have never seen such an amazing movie in india.\nIf you love watching thriller and suspense this is one of the best given by bollywood to its audience.","label":0},{"review":"8√ó10 was way too ahead of its release time ...
