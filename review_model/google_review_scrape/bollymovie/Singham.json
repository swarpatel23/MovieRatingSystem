Singham is now transferred to Mumbai and gets to play a very important role on a larger landscape. One of his loyal and honest cop’s dead body is caught along with copious amounts of money, and that gets him involved in some nasty political war.\n\nSingham Returns is definitely bigger, but not necessarily better.
