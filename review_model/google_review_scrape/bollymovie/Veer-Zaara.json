Music of this film is contratory to the then music and it is very very very sensitive. I almost cried quite a few times whilst watching this epical drama. ShahRukhKhan is my favorite actor and he has done the justice to the role offered to him. This movie revolves around my pubic days and I had fallen in love with love. The railway station scene is perhaps the most iconic scenes of the Bollywood world. Yash Chopra has added the flavor of Punjab which sums up extremely and makes one damn emotional. The village part of the movie is so heartbreaking and overwhelming. \n\nLoving someone is a special feeling and two sided love makes the best story of all times... \n\nWarning : After watching this movie you would be quiet and dull for few days. Such has been the aura of this iconic romantic drama.","label":0},{"review":"It is the best movie full of romance and sacrifice.
