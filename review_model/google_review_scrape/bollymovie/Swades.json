Be it Mohan Bhargav (my favorite character superbly performed) or Geeta (beautiful and simple girl) or Kaveri Amma. The story beautifully conveys the messages leaving you speechless with emotions and tears.\nThere are several instances where you can feel the powerful acting. One of my favorite is when Mohan visits Haridasji and while coming back seeing a small boy selling water in kulhad decides to buy a glass from him despite being an NRI. Another favorite one is while everyone sitting at school location on Dusshra on being asked about the conditions in the U.S. how meticulously Mohan explains that one can't judge the country on the basis of varied culture and traditions. Bullseye!!","label":0},{"review":"Mind blowing movie. Easily one of my favorites. I like that slight dab of patriotism in this movie along with the will to progress our nation (countryside).

It‚Äôs something which bollywood has stop producing now a days..it teaches what meaning of true patriotism is..it traches to get up and try to find solutions for problems around you by yourself instead of looking at govt or someone else. Decade old movie but still relevant and I think it will always be. I expect bollywood to make more movies like this.","label":0},{"review":"There are movies and then there is Swades! I guess am too biased since i have watched it innumerable timesüòä \n\nSRK never like this before or after.  Every person who graces the screen adds.  Be ready to get ur tear buds streaming.. And also enjoy the feel good which the movie gets one into.\n\nMusic is another of its stars.  Each song bettr than the previous. \n\nSalute u director ji. Wat a piece of art.","label":0},{"review":"This film stands right there at the apex of excellence for Indian cinema. It is so beautifully crafted piece of artwork that the viewer falls short of words to describe it.

It is inspiring yet falls short of catching the pulse. The actors stood out, espl the actor playing Kaveri Amma‚Äôs character.
