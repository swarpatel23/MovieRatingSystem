It‚Äôs about a cop  investigating another Cop who was already famous for destroying the underworld.\nThe only emotion you can see in the movie is between the father and daughter. \nNagarjuna solely had pulled this full off his shoulders along with the villain Pasari. No other characters played any significant role. The heroine and the daughter has played their roles best in their vicinity.\nThe sound designing is so unique that it time and again reminds that‚Äôs it‚Äôs an RGV movie. However, the sound was used more than required in few frames and unreasonable in some scenes. \nThe action sequences are always plus in RGV movies and you can see the real and raw action which is to the human capacity threshold of fighting the demons. \nThe Distinctive Camera work was simply amazing as the GoPro and flow cam was used to the optimum which again reminds you of RGV in every frame. However it disturbs the plot and stresses the eyes but in very few instances. \nThe two songs are situational and lyricist did a decent job in jotting the simple liners which will be hummable.\nBackground score and Theme music is apt to the script and well served.\nNo Punch dialogues nor any memorable liners are in the movie.\nThe investigation sequences are very interesting and realistic but interlinked story seems illogical in some places as the flash back was not properly narrated. Villain role was so prominent as of the hero, so casting a strong looking villain would have been an added advantage. \nThough the movie was filmed in low budget, the production values are supremely high and there was no compromise in cinematography and resolution.\nAll Inclusive, the director had done a commendable job in filming the story to the celluloid with the content what he believed without any apprehension.\nOverall it‚Äôs a Paisa Vasool movie and watching it in theatre will be much impactful. \nComparing with Siva is brutal however this will remain as one of the BEST of RGV‚Äôs movies by far.\nMy suggestion to watch the movie. Don‚Äôt miss it.\n\n*RGV himself is a Galaxy of Talent and a Volcano of technical brilliance. So rating him with any Stars will be utter Rubbish.*\n\nP.S. :- The story which was leaked as Officer script earlier has no resemblance with the actual movie at all.","label":0},{"review":"Though promotions are very crucial, Wish I could convey / shout / plead to stop promoting the film with immediate effect from business angle, one trailer gave enough evidence on what to expect.

The theatre was sparsely occupied obviously by diehard RGV fans who appeared to be apprehensively praying for the director.

Sometimes the hero and heroine doubled as photographers who took selfie shots while acting ! As everyone prayed for the movie to end, the audience were careful not to make that sigh of relief audible. The resilient audience felt sorry for RGV and seemed forgive him though....! I would still wait for comeback RGV film and wish him success.... because...he champions the cause of a free spirit!!","label":0},{"review":"Nagarjuna surprises all with his handsome looks and charming personality even at his age.
