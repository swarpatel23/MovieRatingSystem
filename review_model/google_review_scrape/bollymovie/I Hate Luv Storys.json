Even in the the serious times, comedy isn't missed. All songs are equally amazing and it is very hard to choose one but ya of course, 'Bin Tere' will keep reverberating in your mind. The title song is amazing, Shreya ghoshal has given her best solo 'Bahara', 'Sadka' is also very nice and has the feel of 'Khuda Jaane', Jab Mila Tu is a cool semi love song. Imraan has acted very nice. \nHonestly, I need to watch this film 10000 times to find any mistakes, this is flawless. \nReviewing after Anjaana Anjaani so just loved the movie\nI rate this 10/10","label":0},{"review":"Hi...
