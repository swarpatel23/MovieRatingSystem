[{"review":"Enjoyed the movie. Creepy as hell and the characters were relatable, fun and endearing. I cared what happened to them. It's a found footage film and I wouldn't exact call it an original film. It's a mash up of a whole bunch of found footage horror films like the Blair Witch, and Evil dead but I'd still recommend watching it. Also check out the movie \"6-5=2\".","label":0},{"review":"This movie was so chilling! I always enjoy a horror flick but an Indian one is rare to find.
