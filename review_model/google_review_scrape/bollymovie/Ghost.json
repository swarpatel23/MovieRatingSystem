Sanaya owns the movie but the others performed so well. \nThe performance of Sanaya Irani is sublime, her body expression, her look in each scene, her pain and of course her facial expressions.... the emotional scenes she expressed so well.... that you can feel her feelings. And the music of the movie are amazing. No wonder they became hit immediately. Very very good!!!! Brilliant Ghostüëèüëèüëè Everyone should watch this masterpiece!","label":0},{"review":"Ghost review :\n\nAfter Ramsays in the 80s, it is Vikram Bhatt who has been the torchbearer of horror genre in Bollywood. Delivering campy (at times cheesy) products like 'Raaz' (2002), '1920' (2008) and 'Haunted' (2011), Vikram has tasted fair amount of success mixing liberal doses of sex with horror.

Delivering campy (at times cheesy) products like 'Raaz' (2002), '1920' (2008) and 'Haunted' (2011), Vikram has tasted fair amount of success mixing liberal doses of sex with horror. His latest film 'Ghost' is similar to 'Raaz' and '1920' in terms of theme but falls a tad short in the scare quotient. Moreover, even the sex scenes are quite thanda here..\n\nA morphine addicted lawyer (Sanaya Irani) takes up the case of a politician (Shivam Bhaargava) accused of murdering his wife. \"I didn't do it, a ghost did\", is his defence. Before we can say boo...the lawyer starts experiencing the paranormal. She also falls hopelessly in love with her client. It's all too familiar and far too predictable. \n\nOn the films positive, the London setting lends the film a glossy look. A couple of songs are pleasing to the ears and well shot. \n\nLeaping from TV to the silver screen, Sanaya Irani is impressive as the lawyer turned lover who gets entangled in this bhootiya case. She not only looks hot and sexy in the bold scenes but is equally convincing in the courtroom. The lady can look forward to more mature roles in Bollywood! \n\nOn the other hand, Shivam Bhargaava is absolutely dull and wooden even in an author backed role. He appears dazed and lost in most of the scenes. Emraan Hashmi, you are missed!!\n\nFinally, Ghost, justifying its title, is just a ghost of Vikram Bhatt's past successes offering nothing new. BOO HOO! \n\nRegards\nSumeet Nadkarni","label":0},{"review":"Sanaya acting wow she is amazing she bs her movie are so underrated. So talented yaar .

What a story it is! Sanaya totally slayed as Simran Singh, its one of her best performances!\n.Sanaya looks pretty looks like a doll, she owns every scene in it.\n Go watch her in the cinemas\n#GhostTheFilm #SanayaIrani","label":0},{"review":"Although story could have been better you just can not miss the performance of the female lead. Sanaya Irani plays a tormented, conflicted soul as only she can - in a manner that is both deeply affecting and disquieting. It is a role that is both emotional and physical - she stays on top of its demands all the way through. Music is catchy.","label":0},{"review":"Sanaya Irani makes her good performance so far. Music is the key point of this movie. The Bg score is something that u want to listen it again & again. Some of the scary moments is there, u gonna love that. Must must watch for horror fans.

The acting was really bad in the whole movie, except for some parts. It was scary for like 20 minutes of begining and then it just kept getting boring. The cringe use of jump scares and loud music made it the worst. \nThe songs were quite good but seriously. It felt like a horror movie from the 90s.","label":0},{"review":"have seen how fantabulous talented #sanayairani in dal maang  scene \nthis is nothing infront of rest scenes she has in #GhostTheFilm believe it absolutely nothing \nWhen watch it u will rediscover masterpiece called sanaya \nand have all ur emotions ready fear sad romantic  #GhostReview","label":0},{"review":"high level & great PERFORMANCEüîùüí•üèÖüíØüëçMASTERPLASE !!!
