" Ranjeeta Kaur Performs Very Well In Another Lacklustre Shameless Bollywood Ripoff","'Zindagi Tere Naam' is a shameless highly Bollywoodized ripoff of Nick Cassavetes's 'The Notebook'. The only reason I watched this was because it marked the 'comeback' of Ranjeeta Kaur. Not much of a comeback because she doesn't have much screen time even though she does perform very well alongside Mithun Chokroborty (sharing fine chemistry). The Indian landscape forms quite a nice view of the background. Concerning the rest, it's pretty bad. I mean Indian soap opera bad. What's with all the heavily bright colours? The background score is dreadful. The direction is pretty awful. He can't even copy properly. The songs are just as bad. There's even an item number by Dia Mirza which is obviously thrown in randomly to make this movie a hit. I do hope Ranjeeta stays to do much better films (like she deserves). If there is anything watchable about 'Zindagi Tere Naam' it's her scenes with Mithun."
