" Great Slick James Bond Type Entertainment","Don was great James Bond type entertainment. It had action, music, babes, great photography, good music and a surprise ending. What more do you want? It also bought some old memories back. I was amazed at the quality of production like special effects, camera angles, shooting locales, car chase, sky diving etc. SRK tries his best to fit the larger than life role of Don and does a good job. The women are just fillers. SRK is the movie.For all the people out there who posted negative feedback and criticized the movie....Did you guys expect this to be an art movie? Have you seen how stupid the original Don is? Compared to the original this is a great improvement.I think there is going to be a Don 2 coming soon." 
" An excellent film","Don just continues to prove that Farhan Akhtar is a brilliant director, taking a big budget blockbuster and making it smart, fast-paced and fun. Shahrukh Khan does really well as the villain, something I had not expected going into the movie. Priyanka Chopra is strong as the female lead, and Arjun Rumpal is especially good in his smaller but important role. The music in the movie is one of its strongest points, every song is carried out with excitement, yet the songs don't take away from the plot of the movie at all, they enhance the scenes they are complementing. One of my favorite Bollywood films of the past couple years, up there with Rang de Basanti and Kal Ho Naa Ho." 
" One of Shah Rukh Khan's best films","It is great to see SRH doing a negative role after a long time in previous films like Baazigar & Darr, mostly people think that he is better off in romantic roles but I like him in negative. The film was a terrific action, thriller and the use of modern technology looked fantastic quite similar to the James Bond movies. I've not seen the original Don but I don't think that will turn out to be good as this one because it's an old film which I'm not really keen of. I don't mind remakes as long as their good, most of them are rubbish e.g. Devdas & Umrao Jaan but Don is simply the best remake ever! Farhan Akhtar has proved to be a good director. Songs are excellent my most favourite song is "Yeh Mera Dil" because the lyrics had 2 meanings and Kareena Kapoor was looking so glamour's as usual. The scene where SRH & the other guy fell from a plane while fighting for a parachute was amazing & unexpected a scene like that has never been tackled before in a Bollywood movie, the other scene that was really cool is the fight just before the ending with Boman Irani. The twist in the end was the icing on the cake of the whole film and Don has proved that "Not only is it difficult to catch Don - It's impossible!!!"" 
" Simply Brilliant - and i loved the original '78 Don as well","Don (2006) is a thrill a minute, edge of the seat, don't blink or you'll miss something, superbly stylised action movie. It's a sort of Don(1978) meets James Bond (the Pierce Brosnan era, with all its hi-tech gadgetry etc). It is unbelievably slick and amazingly cool. Its got the finish of a top-end magazine like Vogue or GQglossy, beautiful, a work of art. And the action scenes are breathless, non-stop and come at you one after another.I had severe reservations about Mr Khan as Don. Especially as there are few bigger Mr Bachchan fans than me  I idolise the man. However, I've come from the movie convinced that no one else in the current set of stars could've carried it off as well as Shahrukh. He looks and behaves like Don  completely different to the chocolate faced 'Main Hoon Na' and 'Kal Ho Na Ho' giggling lover boy we are used to. In this movie he has a steely look about him, a nastiness that is very believable. He is slightly over the top, but only to the degree you would want him to be.Priyanka Chopra simply sizzles. When I look at her on screen now I'm ready to do all the things Jim Carrey does in the 'Mask' when he see's Cameron Diaz dance at the club ! The great thing, I remember, about watching Don (1978) as a 7 year old, was that when you came out of the movie (and for the next few days)you felt you were Don ! You wanted to be like him, copy all mannerisms, you were mesmerised, felt the sense of power. I saw the same impact of this Don (2006) on my son (coincidentally also 7 years old). But even better, it still had the same impact on me ! Just love it ! Check out my full review at apurvbollywood at blogspot" 
" Don reincarnated!","The movie was stunning. You have to give full credits to Farhan Akhtar. His way of presenting the previously said story is completely unmatchable. At times, the movie was way over the top of exaggeration but in the end everything falls in place. The movie was fast tracked at many places and many sequences were skipped that were present in the previous version. Some plots were twisted to bring in the modern day touch and nothing seemed unnecessary. The sequences were copied very much to the exactness of the situation and it was a good effort to bring back the charisma that a personality like Don should have. One more special thing about this movie is its climax, which was not at all stereotype. One would not expect such a thing in bollywood movies and yet it was brilliantly done. I would say DON was an overall entertainer and is definitely worth a watch." 
" A pleasant surprise...Job Well Done...","First things first,let me tell u that I did not like the Original DON(1978) that much.It was good in parts but it was only the Aura of AB with the music that actually pulled it off.If the same story had been reused,the movie would have ended up being a disaster.But,I guess Farhan Akthar does a great job in this movie.Yes,the beginning is a bit slow but he more than makes up for it by the time the movie ends.Shah Rukh is incredible as DON and the others do their job well.The music is good(A special mention to the Background track...its incredible..).And watch out for the climax...Pros:1)Great acting by Shah Rukh2)Amazing cinematography (Everything looks classy and stylish..just notice the way Shah Rukh wears his tie!)3)A nice racy background scoreCons:1)Beginning does feel as a bit of a crawl..2)Jasjit's (Arjun Rampal) role wasn't required if u ask me..Overall,a great entertainer and worth the wait..!" 
" Don ki Remake was awaited by every fan, but to enjoy it is not just possible; it is inexorable","Don is the movie that shows Shah Rukh Khan at the top of his game. After having already played numerous memorable characters, he has taken the role of DON and made it his own, with shades of many of his previous memorable roles but given a megawatt jolt. His inexhaustible charisma lights up the biggest larger-than-life character in the history of Hindi cinema.Farhan Akhtar demonstrates again why he is one of the most promising directors in Bollywood. He has covered every aspect of the movie with brilliant poise and delivers a highly intelligent action movie. Akhtar has taken of something much revered and made a contemporary, and true, classic that preserves everything laudable about the original, and improves on its every fault. The characters are more fully drawn and their roles are better balanced to provide a more cohesive and engaging narrative.Boman Irani does a commendable job with a crucial role in the movie. Arjun Rampal hardly flinches in what could have been a breakout role but at least stands his ground. Kareena Kapoor makes an excellent turn as the new Kamini and hits every note just right. Lending a lot of substance to the role, she does it more justice than was done to it in the original.It's almost a shame then when Priyanka Chopra becomes the principal female character. She certainly looks the part, especially as it was physically demanding, but doesn't really accomplish anything outstanding with it. Much more note-worthy is Isha Koppikar in the role of Anita. The role is very light on screen time and as subtle as it is brief. Koppikar though, gives a magnificent and under-stated performance to make it shine.The female characters aren't given much focus, but they integrate well into the story and to the central character of DON and give scope for improvement in future instalments of what should become Bollywood's most favoured franchise.The fight sequences could have been improved with better choreography, while the other action sequences range from fairly well-executed to excellent, and all make up a major step forward for Bollywood. The good production value really shows through on the screen.The soundtrack is fantastic and seamlessly complements the on screen proceedings. Each song is not just entertaining, but also progresses the story.The movie has hundred per-cent replay value; it is engaging and entertaining every time." 
" Excellent movie to watch","Do not miss the start and do not miss the ending.This movie has been shot very well, with the locations and cinematography at its best. The start of the movie goes a bit slow and then picks up pace. I think Shahrukh has not over acted this time. The cast has been chosen perfectly to do their job.This movie is a bit different from the original Amitabh Bachchan's DON, so comparing both the new and old movie is out of the question. Each one of them is good in its own league. For the people who have seen the original DON, at first, you start to think that it might not be so good, and justice has not been made to the original. As the movie goes on, you start to change your mind.As for me, the overall the movie was really good and worth every bit of money paid to watch the movie." 
" don...don..","i haven't seen the actual big B's don , but i watched the don in Tamil as 'Billa' with Rajinikanth in the lead. now i have seen this Don. Farhan Akhtar, a young director in Indian cinema, did only couple of movies before,but i really wondered the way he made the film with very good technical aspects and with style. the camera work is excellent, i felt like watching a Hollywood movie. i think writer changed the story little bit in the end, which is very clever and interesting. the climax is very well made. the songs and background score are done extremely well. particularly the background music when don comes, ' don... don...'.Shahrukh Khan, i have seen many movies of SRK, but this is something different after long time, in a negative role. he did really well. apart from SRK Boman Irani, Arjun Rampal,Priyanka Chopra did their part really well.i think remaking an old movie is not trend in Indian cinemas. but this will change the trend.overall VERY GOOD entertainment" 
" Support this movie.","Truly speaking after the performance of Srk in Kank, i thought that he would lost his possession.I am not a great fan of him but i do respect him. After watching Don, i believe that he is a true class actor. I never believed that bollywood can make a movie like Hollywood. But Don erased my doubts. This is the movie that we should accept and appreciate. According to me, this is the only bollywood movie till date that has shown bollywood has a capacity of making movie like Hollywood. Wat a scene, background, sleek, action, picturisation, and most of all the brilliance performance of Sharuk brings lump in viewers throat. The most awesome part of the movie is the climax. No one thought that climax would make in such a way and we believe that this is perfect ending. For more u have to watch urslef.Sharukh never looked like a bollywood actor in this movie. He looked more like western guy. His facial expression is perfect. PPL this is the movie that u should encourage if we want our movie to be recognize globally." 
" The "Don" of a New Era",""DON KA INTEZAR TO MUJHE GYAARA (11) MAHINON SE THA, LEKIN MAIN YEH NAHIN JAANTA THA KE DON KE TICKETS MILNA MUSHKIL NAHIN, NAMUMKIN HAI."I couldn't catch Don on the first day of release as it was all sold out, and I had been extremely busy at work the whole of last week to even think about the movie, and buying tickets in advance. Anyways, no harm done. I watched Don just tonight, on the second day. And what an experience it was.Amitabh Bachchan made Don immortal in the 1978 original. SRK re-does that now in 2006 for generations to come. And though I do not want to give too much away, Farhan Akhtar has done something to Don that the original version did not. You will have to watch the movie and find that out for yourself, though.As a director, FA takes care of everything in a frame. Extremely talented, his attention to detail is impeccable. From the moment the film starts, till the very last shot, the film is a slick, stylish thriller of blockbuster proportions.SRK does a really good job, both as Don and as Vijay. Priyanka Chopra as Roma does a fine job too, and the martial arts training paid off. Boman Irani as DeSilva and Om Puri as Malik are very good, as would be expected. Arjun Rampal as Jasjit is great, and in fact makes you feel much more for the character than Pran (in the original) did, in my opinion. Personally, I thought the actresses picked to play Kamini (Kareena Kapoor) and Anita (Isha Koppikar) could have changed roles. Kamini does nothing but jump in the "Ye Mera Dil" song, and although some dance steps from the original have been retained, she does not bring in the sexy siren factor to as much an extent as Helen did, in the original. I thought Isha Koppikar could've done that.The movie pays homage to the original, which will be to the delight of fans of the 1978 version, by keeping a lot of the dialog the same. The situations are similar, the setting has been changed. Instead of Deepu and Munni (Jasjit's son and daughter), there's only Deepu, which is good because Munni was redundant anyways. Much like that, many little changes have been made, not only to go with today's times, but also to tighten up the screenplay.The title song as well as the "Aaj Ki Raat" song have been shot really, really well. "Main Hoon Don", in particular, really looks good, with the Moulin Rouge kind of setting and slick camera work. Simply by the way it's shot, and the expressions and behavior of the people involved, the audience is treated to an inside look on the lives of Don's gang. "Aaj Ki Raat" carries a wonderful retro/disco feel, visually, and reminded me of Parveen Babi's era.Farhan Akhtar has added certain twists in the movie that weren't there in the original, and it is these that make this a Farhan Akhtar film. The twists are a shocker for both the new viewers, as well as for those who've watched the original. In fact, I think they come as a greater shock for the viewers who've watched Amitabh's Don, because they will be under the impression that they know what's coming. Brilliant.The film has been handled really well, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't see too many reasons why it wouldn't go down well with most people, except for those (my wife for one) who can't stand SRK. As for me, I'm a fan, always have been. Way to go." 
" If SRK wanted a shot at 007, well he did a great job with DON","I sat spell bound this afternoon in a theater. It was great. In my opinion a 10 for my expectations. For the first time I never wondered where the fast forward button was on the movie. My opinion of the Kareena Kapoor changed completely. You have to see it to believe it. She is sexy! It's a 3 hour film. But it holds ones attention very well. SRK is a great villain as usual. Although they hint several times in the movie what the out come will be, until you reach the end it's not fully disclosed. There's one scene that is similar to a James Bond scene. The only thing is that the bad guy isn't Jaws and he doesn't land on a circus tent. It really is fun to watch on the big screen. Don't miss it. - And for those who have seen the first DON, SRK and Big B are different artists. They do things differently." 
" Watch it","The movie is a slick action flick. Well the old don was clichéd, and just good performance by Big B was the only thing that made it watchable. I hate how critics trashed this film calling old don a classic. Gimme a break. And if you watch closely, nothing is much changed, it's not coz farhan was too lazy to change the script, it's his interpretation of the clichéd story. Just watch the movie once more after you saw the film, and you'll understand how well it is directed by farhan. SRK as the don is cool but the vijay role was over his head. Priyanka is good. Boman is excellent. Arjun is decent. Must watch, you won't be disappointed unless you are just watching to make wortheless comparisons between the two.a 7.5/10 from me and a very good attempt by farhan! Waiting for Don 2." 
" A Nice Remake with very awesome twist...","Well what to say about this movie guys when i heard review on the release day i was shocked when local public said it was flop but than also i thought i should go once for this movie and you know what according to me this movie rock's guys a entertaining movie which will not make you bored for a single minute when u say about songs they are awesome & movie is very good, SRK has done a decent role not very good but it was good overall, movie is very interesting whenever you are loosing some interest you found a twist which made climax shocking for the public cant say more just go and watch guys and don't listen to public opinion make your own opinion i know maximum people will say it rocks in the end..." 
" visually pleasing glossy good entertainer!!!","You want a hunky shahrukh khan, a va va voom Priyanka who seems to have worked out like hell to get that figure; an angel faced Isha Koppikar, FANTASTIC shots of Malaysia and i say FANTASTIC, a wonderfully underplayed intense performance by a mesmerizingly handsome Arjun Rampal slick action sequences and an as usual highly entertaining and effective performance by Boman Irani ......go see Don.Oh and the song picturisations are very good too...especially title track and Khaike Paan Banaraswala....Bear in mind this is an action packed remake of a thriller and also made purely to entertain...so don't go nitpicking small details like people did in the case of Fanaah....sit back sip on your coke, chomp on your popcorn and enjoy!No one reveal the ending please.....let the others enjoy as i did the twist in the end!!!" 
" Has Most Of The Right Ingredients But Still Falls Short","Many seem to have loved this flick but I found it to be average at best. Nothing memorable but not too bad for a remake. Farhan Akhter decorates 'Don' with high tech visuals, slick action sequences, gloss and glamour. He opts for a different (but still predictable) ending compared to the prequel. Yet, it falls short of being among the best films of the year. 'Don' had potential to be a lot better but it lacks heart. I wouldn't call it an improvement over Farhan's debut venture 'Dil Chahta Hai'. I admit that it's unfair to compare these two totally different films but the reason I mention it is because there are far more flaws in 'Don'. The chase scenes drag on and they're very repetitive. The pace is very slow at times. Some editing could have been helped.Shahrukh is quite convincing as 'Don'. This isn't his best but it's good enough. However, he doesn't seem to have a strong chemistry with any of the female leads. This was a big surprise to me because no matter how his movie or acting is in other movies, he always managed to maintain a strong chemistry with the ladies. I think this is more the actress's fault because they don't impress. Priyanka Chopra appears to be clueless (she doesn't have chemistry with any of the cast member let alone Shahrukh Khan) and in a few scenes with Vijay, she seems to be copying Juhi Chawla. Moreover, her fight scenes were laughable. Ishaa Koppikar barely has a role to speak of. Kareena Kapoor delivers a forgettable performance and her item number is disastrous while her death scene is hilarious. Arjun Rampal is equally forgettable. Boman Irani and Om Puri are adequate.The music is strictly OK, with a few exceptions: 'Yeh Mera Dil' and 'Khaike Paan' being the worst and 'Aaj ki Raat' being the best.'Don' has an okay screenplay, mediocre (to bad) performances, some interesting visuals, mostly forgettable music and very few good action scenes. I didn't like it so much and I don't think I would ever want to watch it again. Once is enough."
