" Sweet pure love story","There are certain films that you go to watch with low expectations and they just blow you off with impeccable story telling. DumLagaKeHaisha is one of them.There is hardly any moment in this 2 hr movie that can bore you and every scene has something to offer to the viewer. Its a simple story from Hindi heartland set on the basic premise that love cant be forced, it will happen if it has to no matter how the opposite person looks.Performance wise lead protagonists - Ayushman Khurana and Bhumi Pednekar - are good. More importantly their odd chemistry works. Sanjay Mishra is top notch. Other supporting cast is also noteworthy.Director Sharat Kataria is the one who deserves maximum credit for this lovely movie. He does not give too much space to melodrama and keeps the narrative simple. He does take some cinematic liberties to tell his story but that can be easily ignored. Finally, kudos to YashRaj banner (which has produced some obnoxious movies recently) for supporting this movie.Go watch this movie. It deserves a share of your income to say the least." 
" Must Watch Movie of 2015. Ayushmann Khurrana has a long way to go!","DLKH brings the much needed freshness in Bollywood romance movies. And it comes with a very strong message woven around a very sweet love story. The direction is impeccable with moderated melodrama. Ayushmann Khurrana might never get the stardom like the Khans and the Kapoors but he is definitely one of those actors never afraid of doing path breaking movies and top them up with amazing natural acting - be it comedy or drama. But he gets a good competition from the new girl Bhumi Padnekar who delivers a very good performance, depicting a struggle of a fat girl in a white skin - size zero obsessed society of India. Sanjay Mishra, playing the role of Ayushmann's father, gives a memorable performance with really good dialog delivery topped up with brilliant comic timing. The length of the movie is unusually short for a Bollywood movie but then quality is always more important than quantity. Overall, for someone in a mood to watch a light romantic movie, your search ends at DLKH. This movie comes easily into the list of "movies I can watch anytime"." 
" Do yourself a favor, go and grab the tickets and embrace Dumb Laga Ke Haisha","When a movie teaser is released, it has to be catchy and interesting that should fuel the curiosity among the moviegoers to spend few bucks for that cinema. Dumb Laga Ke Haisha exactly works on that strategy. It had limited release ( 769 screens all over India) with shoe-string budget ( 13 crores) and unknown star-cast. What worked in its favor - is applauding performances, immensely likable story and mind-blowing script.Marriages are made in heaven but for Prem( Aayush Khurrana), it was made in hell. In Dumb Laga Ke Haisha, marriage is made between two people of different background, different thinking and in different size.New-bee director Sharat Katariya( 10 ML Love) is probably the talent to watch out for. The theme of the movie is simple yet noble, set in the mid-90's with background of beautiful city of Haridwar about simple, ordinary and middle-class business family which will remind of classic movies by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee. The movie is intrinsic to its core right from the beginning with hilarious moments enough to tickle your funny-bone. The initial reel will definitely bring down the house when the boy meets the girl. Even the divorce scene, the fight between the neighbours has been executed brilliantly that would put a smile on your face. Hats off to the director and script writer for making the best out of it. Background score and music is limited yet convincing. Art direction representing a typical middle-class household is worth-mentioning. Cinematography capturing the essence of Haridwar is eye-catching. Coming to the performances, Ayush Khurrana does a fabulous job as a push-over, introvert, loyal son. He does a good comeback after series of flops. New talent Bhumi Pednekar should walk away with few awards this year. This is her first film and the amount of maturity she shows in her acting is astounding. Sanjay Mishra as usual is brilliant.Do yourself a favor, go and grab the tickets and embrace Dumb Laga Ke Haisha. Astounding 5/5" 
" Subtle comedy","This movie does touch the realistic side of commoners with a hint of comedy within it. In a span of two hours the movie covers all the problems and changes a newly wed couple go through. Groom not ready to accept that bird watching is no more an option for him and bride trying to settle in a house where her education is an envy point for others. The comic melodrama keeps the viewer glued to their seats till the end of the movie. Music is nice and simple which pushes viewer to cherish the old and simple times. It was hard to believe that Bhumi Pednekar debuted with Dumb laga ke Haisha. Her eyes and facial expressions never made me feel that I was missing anything in the movie. Part I loved was, when Ayushmaan and Bhumi fight over the songs to be played in the tape recorder. Must say a brilliant idea!!" 
" A film made from heart","A film released.... a stereotype breaks.... an actress doesn't need to be size zero to become a heroine.... A strong story line, screenplay, dialogues, performances by Ayushman khurana and the newcomer bhumi phednekar.... is ready to surprise the audiences.... Music by Anu Malik gives a down to memory lane ride of the 90's.... its a Kumar Sanu Musical all the way...this is the first time i saw audiences sitting right till the end until the song is finished.... Finally with Dumb LAGA KE HAISHA.... Yash raj Films comes up with another love story with a standard of DDLJ and Rab ne bana di jodi..... Its a thumbs up for this movie....." 
" Size Doesn't Matter - Grey Matter Does","Dumb Laga Ke Haisha is a movie that celebrates the unfounding of size and space, and juxtaposes it against the flight of ambitions in a detailed, layered, yet breezy romance that acts as both a social commentary, as well as a mainstream romantic comedy.A narrow by-lane in Haridwar leads to a narrow minded class ten failed simpleton Prem (Ayushman Khurana in a refreshingly natural role) of the 1990s who dreams of Juhi Chawla but is instead married off to a portly and much more educated Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar in a supremely brilliant and dauntless debut).While she dreams of a government job as a school teacher and a husband who respects her, he has nightmares about everything she stands for - be it her intellect or weight. What follows is a refreshingly original and daring film that overcomes stereotypes while bringing a smile on our faces, even as it tugs at our heartstrings.Here the 90s is captured in stunningly nuanced detail by writer-director Sharat Katariya several times, as is the language of Uttar Pradesh (mostly), and the life of a small town (perfectly).Be it a dash of Limca to get over retching, the unspiralling of cassettes using pens, watching of movies in VCPs and VCRs, using landline phones, giving missed calls, the fascination with Kumar Sanu, or a fight using songs being played by a warring couple, the makers get the 90s spot on. What also makes the majority of the scenes worth the 'wait' is Bhoomi Pednekar who 'weighs' her emotions while adding ample 'weight' to her character through a gamut of emotions that are sure to resonate with your heart.Adding 'weight' to the plot is a series of sub plots involving a separated elderly aunt, parents and in-laws struggling with their values, ethics, and modernity, a young brother preparing for his board exams, a 'sankha' with its moralistic lessons, jealous friends, and a contest 'Dum Laga Ke Heisha' aimed to test the ultimate bonding between a married couple. There is humor, action, emotion, shame, romance, and triumph in equal measure that help the film measure up to the 'weighty' expectations of any discerning viewer gasping for a breath of fresh air. What helps is an able supporting cast that makes you want to 'wait' and watch the proceedings.This small film involving small town people is sure to occupy a not so small space in your hearts and minds. All you need to do is give it a chance - just like the leads of this film are told time and again, and love will surely follow.Watch it for an era gone by, for an unconventional heroine, for relationships that survive against the test of time, and for that sense of nostalgia that is impossible to ignore. And last, but not the least, for Kumar Sanu - who is back (along with Sadhana Sargam and Annu Malik no less). This 'Ishq' is 'Kararaa' indeed... and definitely worth its 'weight' in terms of originality, story, and execution. What are you 'waiting' for? Watch it in your nearest theater and do your bit to support good mainstream cinema with a refreshing storyline... Take a bow Yashraj Films!" 
" Excellent Piece | Original Indian Scenario","I was watching this movie just for the sake of entertainment. But i got propelled to log-in on IMDb and write review. What a real daily life scenes and imagery. Just felt Awesome. Acting Was superb. The Story was just original. cinematography Excellent. The places they have chosen , Everything just makes it so real. I will say Every Indian must watch this movie, he will feel inspired. I think Indian cinema is becoming more mature day by day. The Indian Director and Producer have started thinking the real storyline of Hit Movie. Only Money Making is not just required for a cinema. I think cinema is known for the number of hearts it's touches, Number of people it inspires and originality it shows. People always live in reality but they never observe it. But when same thing is shown by some movie, it just becomes so obvious. People pay attention to it. Just Hats off Guys for the work you did. Thank You." 
" Heartwarming and believable","It is never easy to make a movie about a topic like this. Past attempts have mutilated this kind of story so I was skeptical.One is happy to see that the characters (especially the leads) don't take unhealthy and impractical steps. Also there was no (unnecessary) villain waiting to take advantage of either of them. Bhumi acted so believably and Ayushmann complemented her acting. These kind of movies hopefully should be eye openers to ignorant parent in Tier-2/Tier-3 cities and towns and not force their children into arranged marriages. It was just a luck break that the contest (in the end) resolved the marital issues; everybody does not get the same opportunities.Hats off to the cast and Director for pulling off a superb movie." 
" Its not about size...","If the idea of a perfect girlfriend for you is defined by her size, this film is for you. Unlike the 60s and 70s when voluptuous women ruled the fashion scene, in the 21st century models eat tissue papers to fill their stomach. Coupled with a few movies and the business propaganda of health products and gyms, you have the perfect formula for disaster. In DLKH, the story surrounds a family which has reached an agreement with another for the marriage of their children. The groom is particularly unhappy with the shapelessness of his bride, but having to abide by custom chooses to get married anyway lest it should make his family upset. Soon after the wedding, the bride realises the extent of her husband's mental block, when he refuses to get anywhere close to her. The narrative is slow, covering the intricacies of the character's behavior coupled with the happenings of a small town in India. The acting is top-notch, allowing the viewer to diagnose every aspect. The film throws out its moral at you and even if you don't accept it, you are left with no choice but to appreciate it nonetheless.Worth a watch." 
" The film is nothing but simplicity of characters who are bogged down with their below-average mediocre lives.","'DUM LAGA KE HAISHA'Just watched it and feeling so inspired. The film is nothing but simplicity of characters who are bogged down with their below-average mediocre lives.'Sandhya' a fat girl played so very beautifully by Bhumi Pednekar gets married to 'Prem' played so perfectly by Ayushmann Khurrana. Both are from similar socio-economical background but she is educated with a B.Ed and he is 10th fail. This is not the only reason for the unhappiness in their marriage. Prem finds her severely unattractive because of her appearance but this 'dislike' is furthered every she tries to say something or do something which Prem takes as her 'showing off' her education. All this leads a few nasty confrontations but eventually they start understanding each other.The film has some very depressing but realistic scenes portrayed realistically by all the characters, especially Seema Pahwa ji, Sanjay Mishra ji and Sheeba Chadda ji (that one post phone call scene is hauntingly realistic and saddening portrayal!!!!) Don't know why it brought tears to my eyes and that hasn't happened in years!Its an amazing film and one must watch it at least once. The 'art' is amazingly done by one Meenal Agarwal and its totally believable and realistic! The photography is beautiful with some really beautiful 'arty' shots, and its crisply cut by Namrata Rao.'Moh Moh Ke Dhaage' is an amazingly beautiful and soulful song that I am playing on loop right now while writing this.Loved the film! My ratings: 9/10 * * * * * * * * *" 
" You'll love it if you were a kid from the 90's.","A beautiful movie which will take you back in the lovely 90s. If you are a person whose childhood days were spent in a middle class family, residing in a typical U.P. mohalla, then you might find many things that will be a reflection of your childhood. Though a few scenes in the movie are overdone and overemphasized, but still a lot can be enjoyed. Kumar Sanu's songs are as melodious as ever, with Sadhna Sargam and Anu Malik adding more sweetness to it. The songs are really catchy and I can assure you that they'll be looped many times in your ipods/music devices. The movie is worth watching with your family in a theater, so my advice to you is not to ruin the feel by watching it on a crappy pirated DVD or online.Cheers, :)" 
" I didn't loose my smile for not even once for whole movie.","I was expecting to pass some time with this movie. Somewhere between first 5 minutes movies gets interesting for an Indian guy who knows that this kind of situation is very common. They acted in a comical way which, unfortunately, are some real reactions which are faced in Indian society. I do not know why I was smiling throughout this movie. Was it that this movie seems so real, have amazing actors, funny, a sweet love story. There is always a curiosity to know what next will happen, as it seems so real. This movie gets somewhat predictable somewhere near 30 hour before the ending but I was still curious. They didn't take the cliché road and maintained amazing story-line. Although ending was a little cliché but still it was sweet. Watch it if you can, you won't regret it." 
" I would like to give "Dum Laga Ke Haisha" 20 stars because it is just so good","This film is just so good! Right from the opening titles, when it is Kumar Sanu's voice - and not Lata Mangeshkar's aalaap - that accompanies the Yash Raj Films logo, you know that you are in for something fabulous. And just how fabulous, how familiar "Dum Laga Ke Haisha Is"! I have grown up in the 1990s. The very sight of Maxell tapes, the old Sony television set, the push-button telephone set placed in a small alcove in the wall, Bhimsen Joshi's "Mile Sur Mera Tumhara" on Doordarshan, the Reynolds pen with a blue lid, and the name of the choreographer Chinni Prakash in the titles were enough to push me back on a nostalgic trip. If the setting of the film is just-so-perfect, the story and its execution are something to tell everyone about. The daily nitty-gritties of the Indian middle-class life - like, elderly ladies talking to each other in their beds before falling asleep - is just so true to life. Some sequences in the film are just worth watching again and again, like, the musical war between Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana) and Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar), where Sandhya attacks Prem by playing the "Woh Meri Neend Mera Chain Mujhe Lauta Do" song from the film "Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke" and Prem retaliates by playing the "Abhi Zinda Hoon Toh Jee Lene Do" song from the film "Naajayaz" (incidentally, both films were directed by Mahesh Bhatt, who was a star-filmmaker in the 1990s). I cannot believe how a film can be so well-written and well-made and yet remain so down-to-earth. The chemistry between every actor in this film - and not only the main lead - is just fabulous. I am afraid I will just go on giving out more spoilers, and that is because I just loved this film! There is a scene with Sheeba Chadha (who played Aishwarya Rai's cousin in "Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam" and one of John Abraham's lovers in "Jism"➖I am naming these films only to bring in some nostalgia factor) who plays the hero's aunt - bua - who has been disowned by her husband, so she lives with her brother's family. This scene has the bua being informed that her husband, who disowned her all those years ago and practically made her live like a widow all her life, has died; so, being the deceased man's wife - although disowned - could she attend the funeral? The character's rage and emotions in this scene is worth seeing, where she first rebukes the informer for insulting her by informing of the death of her husband and inviting her to his funeral, and then she weeps inconsolably at finally being really widowed. This is one of the best scenes. Another scene has the hero's mother attending the divorce court even as she has been fitted with an IV line. This sequence is hilarious to say the least. In the race sequence, when Sandhya, being carried by Prem on his back, tells him: "Humein kahin nahin jaana, rok lijiye humein" ("I don't want to go anywhere else, please stop me"), this part is an absolute tearjerker. IMDb allows just 10 stars. I would give "Dum Laga Ke Haisha" 20 stars. This film is just so good." 
" One More Sucker Realizes Ultimate Tolerance.","Rating : 4 & 1/2 stars out of 5 : Outstanding (a disconnected dishonest finale still cannot undermine the overall merit of this natural and remarkably sprightly picture)Dumb Laga Ke Haisha ( "Heavo-ho! Carry that load" to quote directly from the film's excellent subtitles) is a title that sounds like it is going to be a flippant ride but this film is not a romantic comedy that it is wrongly promoted to be - its nuances are far more meaningful than what is permitted within the scope of a comedy. Sharat Katariya , who has both written and directed this film, has accomplished what very few of his compatriots have done : crafting a socially incisive beaut that is smoothly studded with as many serious moments as deftly lighter ones.Cut to plot : It is 1995 in Haridwar made beautiful by the artful camera-work of Manu Anand. Prem (Ayushmann Khurana) is a handsome young man who's in charge of a cassette shop that will soon give way to the era of CDs. This time of flux is also mirrored in Prem's last days of bachelorhood. His father (an excellent Sanjay Mishra) terrorizes his son into marriage with an obese woman despite Prem's loud protests. His wife Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar) is a sweet-hearted girl whose womanly charms would have received much better scope if she was twenty-five kilos lighter but the reality is that she's not. Prem ignores her very often, tries to hide her from his social circle and eventually reaches a flashpoint through a series of loud public scandals at which point Sandhya, who has been patient and understanding all along, is so upset with his rejection of their marriage that she files for divorce. The court accedes but asks for six months of their marital life to elapse before it is done.The film is more direct and blunt than yesteryear Hindi films which showed a similarly woebegone husband , and DLH is all the better for it because its cheek and shameless vigour unearths truths that the former films neither had the gumption nor the talent for. A scene of implied sexual intercourse acquires unexpectedly bawdy shades that are nevertheless delightfully wicked. Prem is no silently suffering martyr and his friends are not the wise caring types who will expery support him through these trying times - he violently reacts to their insensitivity with shocking declarations that though nakedly true, disqualify him resoundingly from gentlemanliness. Prem's family adds to the circus. His father , despite his several endearing shades, is still a domineering moron who coerces his son into a disastrous union. There are two senior women in the house neither of whom have the brains or the heart to support their young ward in declining an alliance he clearly hates. Repeatedly the film shows us a pattern : family togetherness however artificial it may seem, reigns supreme while individual choice is routinely slaughtered. This central systemic conceit that throbs through the disturbed heart of DLH is exactly what has killed countless marriages and lives in India down the millennia. Like an experienced effortless thespian, Bhumi Pednekar essays Sandhya as a young lady whose sweet temperament is unbreakably married to a stout heart that can withstand the societal taunts at her bulk. Ayushmann Khurana is no less accomplished - hurt, humiliation and rage relentlessly swims beneath his troubled visage. When he lashes out , the anger is palpable and when he breaks down, sympathy springs forth naturally.Songs by Anu Malik deserve the mention of only one composition - 'Yeh Moh Moh Ke Dhaage' - elements of its sparkling melody recall Ismail Darbar's "Jhonka Hawa ka" but there is no doubt whatsoever in the singing by Monali Thakur whose exquisitely beautiful rendition rivals the best of Shreya Ghoshal and Madhushree. Dumb Laga ke Haisha essays a painfully honest journey till its eventual moral cop-out , while a film from the same industry like 2014's 'Queen' also has a genuine beginning which then candy-flosses its way towards a climax that is thankfully bold in its moral choice. But I liked DLH much more than 'Queen' despite the fact that the former lacks the latter's thematically genuine ending. The difference 'lies' in virtuoso story-telling." 
" Most entertaining movie of the month- simple yet refreshing !","A journey to 90's with a special middle class touch . Moreover the subject of arranged marriage is simply hilarious . Plain message is there is more to marriage - then just looks and degrees- that's understanding and true love ! A dose of refreshment, just Simple precise movie which will make your evening wonderful. Also you can't stop laughing by the quirky funny one liners through out the movie. Ayushmann as always is brilliant and the XL heroine is best discovery so far for Yashraj productions. A must watch for the grown ups of 90's ! You will get to see- Bajaj scooters, the old Metador van , the old cassettes touch , Kumar Sanuu's songs - which gives this movie a simple and unusual touch. And the song Dard Karara.. will make your day and you can't stop laughing your guts out." 
" A subtle take on marriage","'Dum Laga ke Haisha' is a finely made film with a charming script and solid acting. While the story may be plain simple and honestly predictable still it doesn't fail to hold your attention for 2 hours. The story is set in 1995, Prem(Ayushmann Khurrana) is a class 10 failure runs his father's (Sanjay Mishra) cassette store in Haridwar. He is forced into marriage with a overweight girl Sandhya (debutante Bhumi Pednekar) by his family. Sandhya is a graduate and Prem's family believes arrival of an educated girl in the family will bring prosperity. Prem is finding very difficult to happiness with his forced marriage and what follows is nothing surprising.Despite the predictable simple story, 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha' has the strong point of subtle production design and great cinematography capturing the 90s era beautifully. The songs of Kumar Sanu played on cassette players certainly pushes up the nostalgia. There is also quite a bit of quirky humor and typical Indian family drama to spice up the things. But I did feel the some work could have been done in editing department as the story drags on for 2 hours. Ayushmann redeems himself after the disastrous 'Hawaizaada', Sanjay Mishra is entertaining as always and Bhumi Pednekar shows her talent with solid debut. The songs are quite melodious, I especially loved 'Moh Moh ke Dhaage'. With some negatives but more positives 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha' is not the best year for me(it's still Badlapur) yet its worth a shot!RATING: [3/5]"
