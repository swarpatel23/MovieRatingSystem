" I Cant Understand ,What the hell the film makers were up to?","Just returned home after the night show of this movie with me and my buddies.........Tell u what I have Just wasted 90 of my precious bucks on this movie..In the beginning i found it very interesting but later i think it lost its track and went to the la-la land The FILM Features a Story of a Script writer gets caught in the lust of another woman (Maya)..loses his job and almost lost his love of life ..his girlfriend.. But gets an offer from Karan Johar in the end......Happy days are here AGAIN!!!!!!!!!I never expected a decent actress like Mahima Chaudhary to give such horny shots. the storyline was good but i guess they were not able to compile the fragments of the film in a proper manner.The work of Juhi Chawla seems to be useless. it seems to me the Juhi and the director had an agreement that Juhi will act in this movie and just to complete the condition she was involved.The title "Home Delivery" has no such important significance in the movie.. Boman Irani who worked in the home delivery pizza shop arrives at Viveks home to make his delivery...talks with Karan Johar on the phone of Vivek's behalf and gets the job done unexpectedly.The film mainly features on the fact that "ONE SMALL MOMENT HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THE LIFE."overall the film is a very disappointing package.I would advise u to give free tickets of this film to all your enemies.Lets Hope That i will see a better film from Sujoy Ghosh in the future...............Cheers Anuj Puranik" 
" Bad copy of Dinner Game Mr Ghosh","Really Poor outright copy of a french movie. Watch this movie and then you will find out how Home Delivery is such a waste of a movie.And I guess Director Ghosh that No one could find out the original french movie by twisting the theme plot. In fact if he had copied the same plot , it would have been more entertaining.To begin with movie kicks off too slowly.At times the movie is so slow that it remains same for more than 5 minutes.There's hardly any character buildup or witty dialogs.Overall movie made by a confused director with lack of creativity in writing a good script.I still feel Indian directors still more maturity and guts to even com bit close to bring Indain film into global arena." 
" The movie has a different feel..","The one thing that makes me enjoy this movie is the different feel the movie has. Can't exactly put that different feel in words but one will definitely find it different from most of the Bollywood movies. The same thing, however, could be a reason for some people to dislike the movie. In nutshell, it's of a different league, not sth everybody would find of taste."
