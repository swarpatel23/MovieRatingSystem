" why was the movie made???","Sometimes u go for a movie and wonder why the hell didn't i go for an evening walk instead or why i didn't go to bed early today... Kidnap will make you wonder why do i bother to go to movies. Its one of those movies which makes you laugh..... on yourself. The movie has a basic storyline of revenge with unlimited flaws which we can ignore. But can we ignore the below average acting or the poor direction and editing of the movie? Apart from the background music i don't think the film makers have paid a lot of attention to what exactly they want to make. The movie was neither a thriller nor an emotional outburst. In the end it made me wonder was it a spoof of some Hollywood movie. Minisha Lambha looked hot throughout the movie and apart from her cleavage show there was nothing more to the scenes filmed on her. Her mother looked like her elder sister. Sanjay Dutt was average and looked a bit out of shape. Imraan Khan disappointed big time. He is no Aamir Khan and he proved it. His acting was not at all convincing and he looked quite uncomfortable doing a serious villain role. Overall I guess the fine actors are as good as director makes them work and here we know who is at fault. I hope all the review readers to skip this movie and think as if this movie just wasn't released. I made the mistake but I have just came back from the show and I have taken the best possible way to save the world from this movie. God help people who see this movie." 
" Another example of Good Promos and Poor Content","Sanjay Gadhvi, comes up with another thriller after his Dhoom movies. As everyone was appreciating the promising promos of Kidnap, it looked like a fast paced, stylish and engrossing thriller. But instead the movie fails to hold your interest from the first scene itself and is not even close to the earlier films by the director.The most annoying thing is when a movie shamelessly starts with a song. This is like taking the viewers as granted and it also indicates that the makers didn't know how to start the movie, so they inserted a song with the heroine singing at the beach in some revealing dresses. I don't know what reasons can be given for starting a thriller movie with a song. Another shock comes right after the unwanted song, when you see Minissha Lamba calling Vidya Maldave "her MOM". Simply, a mis-cast. Neither Minissha looks like celebrating her 18th birthday nor Vidya looks her mother from any angle. By only putting a dialogue that "You became pregnant when you were 18" (for Vidya) cannot justify your mis casting.The kidnap executed by Imran Khan, happens in the first reels itself and the complete story is revealed thereafter. As Imran is looking good playing the kidnapper, the viewer expects that some chilling and exciting drama will unfold in the later reels. But nothing happens and the film keeps on moving uninterestingly. Sanjay Dutt as the father of Minissha looks tired and just plays his part. Minissha acts OK but she seriously has to work on her close ups and Vidya Maldave looks more gorgeous than her on screen daughter. All the others in the cast having nothing much to do.According to me, the USP of the movie could be the plot, where Imran is giving clues to Sanjay Dutt, which are to be solved by him in order to get his daughter back. But this very sequence is the most underwritten part of the script. The clues are uninteresting and the drama created through them does not create the required excitement. As a thriller the movie is not able to bring the viewer on the edge of his seat, which is a must for a good crime movie. It's just another revenge drama, where the child grows up and now wants to take revenge for his lost childhood.There are many unanswered questions in different sequences in the script. Sanjay Dutt easily manages to get everything done as asked by Imran. He easily breaks in and out of the tight security in the house of his rich competitor. He takes a convict out of the jail as a piece of cake. He reaches the station in time, beating the traffic in a strange way and runs like a 25 year young boy. Very strangely, a revealing and stylish wardrobe changes are given to Minissha while she is locked up by her kidnapper. Too many liberties taken by the writer here. A film with this kind of subject surely does not require any songs, but here we have more than 3 songs and that too just as fillers. Pritam has given a very unexpected score with not even one exceptional song.Gadhvi's seems to be a fan of chase and Heist movies. His "Dhoom's" had many sequences related to breaking in and beating security systems, "Kidnap" also has its own similar scenes. But whereas the loopholes of "Dhoom's" were covered by its huge and stunning starcast, this time "Imran" alone cannot cover the faulty script and becomes a victim of it.In few words, Kidnap is another flick, whose promos were better than the main movie. All the expectations raised by its promos are not met and you feel disappointed. The only good thing in the movie is "Imran Khan"." 
" Not just KIDs, all of us had a NAP","After Jaane Tu.. and Bachna... the expectations from an Imran-Minnisha film were sky high. Sanju baba, of course, is all-time dependable. Gadhvi has done some good work in the past-- stylish if not sensible. So we decided to fork over the weekend premium (250 bucks a ticket, including popcorn!) without waiting for reviews.Bad idea. Gadhvi decided to follow, again, the all-style no-soul route.**** May contain spoilers **** The film starts with the dialogue "Maine tumhe kidnap kiya hai" which made the audience erupt in laughter. Not an auspicious beginning for an alleged edge-of-seat-thriller. We decided to give Imran time to find his bearings. Unfortunately, the dialogues kept getting more mundane from then on. It competes with Sarkar 2 for the year's dullest dialogues. (We so hope Sanjoy watches this movie, he can do another killer review!!) Vidya Malavade, the hot babe from Chak De, plays Minissha Lamba's mom in this one!! The casting director must be on drugs. Sadly, this may end Vidya's career, though Lamba looks way older than her. Lamba, on the other hand, is on a mission to establish a sexy image. She appears extremely uncomfortable in near-nothings-- not just in songs but even when she is supposedly in captivity. The costume designer was definitely high. She fails to realise that sexuality is not just in boob-shows but comes as a package-- the facial expression, the body language and the come-hither eyes. There was none. She looks as arousing as the mannequin being changed in a shop window. She tries too hard and wastes the goodwill created by the Bachna... role. Plus the fact that even though her role is pivotal, she hardly has anything to do except mouth dialogues fit for a 7 year old and remain undressed.The acting by Imran Khan is first rate again and I do hope to see him bag the Oscars one day, in footsteps of his uncle. He is a sincere and fiery actor lost in an oddball script. Sadly, the screenplay is so awkward that his intense dialogues appear comical. Whoever in the audience was not sleeping was busy hooting in amusement...He did have a fun chase scene. Outrageous but well executed stunts. The only highlight of the movie, IMHO. Reminded one of Jackie Chan, wish they kept that tone for the entire film. Sigh! Now for my main problems with "Kidnap". Firstly, the revenge motive is thrust down your throat. The plot is as dark as "Zinda", yet the movie maintains a candy-floss feel throughout. You can easily foresee that every character is inherently good and every one had their "majboori". Ergo, everyone forgives everyone and lives happily ever after. For the hate that Imran's character carries for Sanjay Dutt's character, the latter should have been shown more as the "Dilip Tahil" variety. A typical rich, arrogant and ruthless person. The audience must also feel some of the hate. Yet, we always see him in a sympathetic light, we root for him. That makes the revenge hard to digest. Similarly, Imran's character should have been a twisted freak but he appears sad, almost as if he'd stop the revenge if someone said Sorry to him just once. He's a frustratingly good boy, performing evil actions. While that syncs with his character, it jars with the plot.Secondly, it has some gruesome songs. Picturised badly, appear illogically and sound terrible. They completely halt the narrative and everyone looks so uncomfortable even doing them. Lyrics like "Mausam kya Awesome hai". Yikes! Sound engineering is quite good, on the other hand. The scene where Imran brings back Minissha after her escape attempt has fabulous background sounds.Lastly, the climax, like most Bollywood films of late whimpers down after a cool build-up. Somehow our directors start to copy their latest DVD purchase, perhaps Richard Shepard's 1995 flop Mercy in this case, but don't have the patience to watch till the end. Or in some cases, like in Zinda, they are unable to stay faithful to the climax for cultural reasons.Kidnap belongs to the "Anjaam" genre. It is so bad, it finds a cult following. It is a great movie to watch with a large group of friend, hooting and whistling. Just make sure you don't pay attention to the screen, else you will end up with a power-nap." 
" Awful.. Yah..That's the word...","What can I say about this movie?..I wanted to break something or pull my hair while watching the movie... OK.. First of all about direction: In my opinion Sanjay Gadhvi was NEVER a brilliant director.. He was just as mediocre in "Dhoom" & "Dhoom 2" as both the movies were.. And yes, he delivers again the stupidity which he calls "a tribute" to classic Hollywood flicks..About casting, I just can't believe Vidya Malvade was cast as Minissha Lamba's mother.. and a cheap plot point to justify that Vidya was married and pregnant at the age of 18..for God's sake they are not even of same skin color..For Acting, Sanjay Dutt was good, Imran was OK and Minissha Lamba & Vidya Malvade was horrible!.. Ya, really horrible..Other things about the movie includes, Worst music of Pritam (i think it is his original music .. so..), Unsituational songs.. in one song Minissha dances with her kidnapper Imran!.. in a waterfall of course!!..So moral of the story is "Please, Please don't watch movie.. and Ya I said don't watch.. not even producer comes to you and tell you that there is special free screening for you, not even on your cable TV.. and in case if you have to, then make sure to ask for Aspirin"" 
" Bad goods!!!","Expectations are bound to run high especially when you deliver two mega grossers back-to-back ie. Dhoom and D2. And Sanjay Gadhvi is indeed accountable for the missing goods.Sanjay Dutt:: His Conviction was missing and it was apparent. Vidya Malvade:: For starters, I "never" knew she was the "Chak De" girl. Fitted well as independent & opinionated Mrs. Sanjay Dutt. But as Mum to Minisha - nay!! Minisha Lamba:: Try and try harder until you succeed. Well this time around it was trying with the clothes I guess. Skimpy albeit.Imran Khan:: It was written in bold that he was trying extremely hard to put up an intense emotion in the name of acting. Suggest he should stick doing chocolaty-boy roles and then make a natural progression towards parallel oriented performance. Uncle, where art thou?At certain places, the movie carries a look which seems to be inspired by Sanjay F Gupta. Background score is loud. Songs are passable and lyrics are crappy.The plot simply doesn't connect. And the screenplay seems to be loaded with speed-breakers. Extremely poor in writing department (read that cinematic liberties!)." 
" painfully disgusting..movie!","can't believer this movie, i bet a million bucks if you survive this mindless 'torture' thriller for 2 hrs, first 5 Min's into the movie, you'll be amazed how stupid and mindless so called 'game'its gonna be.yea first 5 Min's into movie, you'll know this movie is all about 'revenge' stuff, then minisha lamba strangely seen in her bikini dancing to a haunting number, which irks every other min, then comes here mother who almost knocks you down with her killer looks, it becomes hard on us to believe shez is a mother of 18 yr old, wel there r many issues,like firstly both mother(vidya) and daughter(minisha) compete in showing so called "glamour" irrespective of the situation there r in, secondly, Songs, they do nothing but make things worse,finally the very lame suspense elements in the movie..make you sick n disgusting. its like buying ticket to 'hell' This is one sick movie i have seen in lOng tym..," 
" An average thriller...","Kidnap has the right ingredients for the audience that love masala flicks. A hot Minissha Lamba in skimpy clothes, an item number by Sophie Chaudhary in clothes which if reduced by little would leave nothing to the imagination, decent songs which are beautifully picturized, great action sequences. But its the script that lets the film down. The main motive behind the whole Kidnap, when revealed, is a complete turn off.Kidnap suffers from a story thats hard to digest. Without giving the story away let me brief you on some of the scenes.* There is a sensual bath with loads of cleavage under a waterfall, which reminds us of Zeenat Aman, all this while the girl is held in hostage!* Vikrant Raina releases a crimininal locked up in jail. Raina manages to do so by burning down the jail kitchen and escaping in a fire brigader's uniform.* In a chase sequence, Vikrant is in pursuit of Kabir who climbs buildings like a hero straight out of a superhero film. Vikrant is no less, he gives Kabir a good chase performing those unbelievable stunts.* Don't you think its a tad bit unrealistic for the visibly unfit father of a grown up daughter to be so athletic? Also, at times you can clearly notice the body double. Mind you, the exact same chase is one of the highlights of the movie and has been shot well.* The climax during the New Year eve too is very unrealistic. Not a single soul notices the gun in the Ice box nor while Vikrant pulls the trigger!The chemistry between Imraan and Minissha is poor. Minissha in fact shares a better chemistry with Sanjay Dutt in those limited scenes they share.Sanjay Dutt sleep walks through his role. Imran Khan needs to work on his dialogue delivery. He's fine in his much looked forward-to negative role. Minissha Lamba manages to distract with ample cleavage show, with limited scope for histrionics she does well. Vidya Malvade doesn't suit her role.Overall, Kidnap disappoints. If well-performed action sequences, skin show in abundance and great locales is what you wish to see, Kidnap is worth a watch. Else, wait for the DVD. At the box office, the hype due to several reasons mentioned above, would ensure a good opening. The lower budget (20 crores) compared to most biggies and good opening could result in the cost being recovered by the end of Week 1." 
" awesome movie.......just like the song......","this movie is a very entertaining thriller...it's a must-see especially for Imran Khan fans!!! His lines in the movie were very serious yet hilarious in many ways...for example.....there was one scene when Sonia( main female) asked the kidnapper (Imran Khan)," Why are you torturing me instead of my father that you hate." the kidnapper says, "Why not??" lol....towards the end the kidnapper (Imran) tells Sonia, that, "the next time she decides to swim stay close to the shore." (that's how he kidnapped her in the first place) YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE...especially with friends because there is a lot to comment on.....yay!!!!!" 
" Indian crime thriller and... musical?","RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Sanjay Gadhvi, "Kidnap" chronicles events in India when the daughter (Minissha Lamba) of a rich tycoon (Sanjay Dutt) is kidnapped by a man driven by vengeance (Imran Khan). Vidya Malvade is on hand as the beautiful mother and ex-wife of the mogul. This was only my third Bollywood movie so maybe I'm not the best person to appraise these movies, but I find them interesting for cultural reasons and generally entertaining. The animated credits sequence is overlong and is curiously followed by a pop music video led by Minissha Lamba before the actual movie starts at the 8.5 minute mark. There are a couple of other music videos thrown in later. The language mixes Hindi with some English here and there, which is interesting (I gather this is how they actually speak over there). The story and some of the dramatics seem too contrived and sometimes too quaint. The prison break sequence, for instance, is akin to a goofy Spaghetti Western from back in the day. Nevertheless, this is a unique crime thriller in that it bends over backward to entertain, literally throwing in kinetic song & dance routines. Lamba is curvy, the aging Dutt is resolute analogous to Bruce Willis with a small spare tire and the young Khan is unrealistically formidable, but likable. There's a dynamic rooftop chase in the second half and I liked the moral of the story, which is unmistakably driven home. But the movie is overlong at close to 2.5 hours. WRITERS: Shibani Bathija and six others. GRADE: C/C-" 
" Not bad","This movie was so totally entertaining and enjoyable film scenes of the film a brilliant storyline great movie and enjoyable storyline great movie scenes with brilliant scenes of comedy movie comedy sequel and entertaining and comedy sequel and comedy thriller and entertaining film and comedy sequel and entertaining film and comedy movie was so good I loved them all good songs until they jsjeudneyeneh Imran was superb Sanjay dutt was impressive other were good my rating 7/10" 
" Recipe of a disaster film","Sanjay Gadhvi after making Tere Liye got another chance with Yashraj films with the moderate success of MYKSH which was a remake of My Best Friend's Wedding, but he got success after directing Dhoom and Dhoom 2 and then he left Yashraj and made Kidnap. The film was in news as it was Imran Khan's second film after JTYJN and Sanjay's comeback film after his jail term in 2007. The film is a comedy of errors, gone all wrong. To Start with:The story s so stupid it makes you cringe. The ease at which Imran kidnaps and the cat and mouse game is very childish, The film is filled with stupidity like Imran kidnapping Minisha underwater by making her unconscious when she has hardly worn anything but reaches the place fully clothed, Also the wardrobe changes by Minisha are hard to digest, the scene that takes the cake is Minisha wants a bath so Imran our darling kidnapper takes her to a sea and there is a song There are lot more, like Sanjay conveniently getting a bike to reach a train, Also the shootout at the disco towards the climax and climax.Direction is bad Music is bad, too many songs spoil the showSanjay Dutt looks jaded and disinterested, plus his weight put on makes him look older and bored Imran Khan is hilarious, he doesn't look a kidnapper, also his accent is a put off for the role. Minisha Lamba hardly looks 16 and is okay, Vidya is a miscast as Sanju's wife and Minisha's mom, Reema Lagoo is as usual Rahul Dev has a brief role rest are okay." 
" made me highly disappointed","This is the film which i expected to be good while watching the promos. Imran Khan looked good in the promos...So i was expecting a stylish thriller but it turned out to be a Damp Squib. This film can be a good lessons to actors like Imran Khan and other actors who sign movies in the love for their roles narrated in the film and forget about the script. This is a really awful predictable thriller.Coming to performances, everyone is mediocre except Imran Khan who shines as the kidnapper, although he tends to go weak in his acting several times especially When He confronts Sanjay Dutt in the end, You feel the actor needs acting lessons. Minisha Lamba is an actress who has given respectable performances in her past movies. But here she is terrible. She opted for cleavage and skin show and got nothing from it. Vidya Malavade is OK but you feel like laughing when you come to know she is playing Minisha's mother. Sanjay Dutt is passable. His age is overpowering him, The thing which always knocks my head, I would like to ask the scriptwriter, they never wanted a romantic angle in this movie right? then why they made the kidnapper having a heart of gold and showing a young lady who is showing so much cleavage and doesn't romance. Does it make any sense? A romantic angle could have saved this movie. On the Whole, Don't waste your time for this one...this is one more example of a good idea turned horribly wrong." 
" Total Waste of Time and Money","This movie from start was ill-conceived. It was too simplistic with no twists and will fail to grab your attention for long.In short, this plot had more holes than swiss cheese. The casting was done by a clueless director. The dialogues were weird and didn't do anything to alleviate the miserable plot. Imran Khan did not look the part of a juvenile delinquent or a boy from an orphanage. He looked more like a spoilt brat trying to get his parents attention by creating a nuisance. He concentrated more on looking cool than actually playing the part. Sanjay Dutt's acting was OK but with a spare tire around his midriff he didn't seem to have too much problems matching step for step in the foot chase with Imran.Vidya Malvade looked too glamorous for a mother, whose child has been kidnapped. She didn't once sob uncontrollably or breakdown. I guess that would have messed up her hair and makeup. This wasn't a role for her. Inspite of being kidnapped, Minisha Lamba didn't seem to have any problems coming up with Victora Secret's sexy lingerie,designer clothes or bathing in picturesque settings. Almost makes you want to be kidnapped. Like the Summary Title says " Total waste of Time and Money"" 
" A good movie that could've been great","The story is about Sonia (Minissha Lamba) who lives with her mother, Mallika (Vidya Malvade) and grandmother because her parents divorced when she was ten. A week before her eighteenth birthday celebration, she gets kidnapped.The abductor, Kabir (Imran Khan) is interested in speaking only to her father, Vikrant Raina (Sanjay Dutt); a New York based Indian business Tycoon with a net gross of $51.7 Billion, with whom he has an old score to settle.Vikrant returns to India to retrieve his daughter from Kabir's clutches but is told to carry out a series of daunting tasks set out by Kabir - a condition to rescue her. At the end of each task is a clue that helps Vikrant in coming closer to Sonia.The film had a good appealing story and screenplay but I still felt that it failed to deliver whatever it was supposed to. It is a thriller that wasn't thrilling and had so many flaws and plot holes that I was busy counting them rather than enjoying the movie e.g. Vikrant Raina is the richest tycoon but he only looked rich in his introduction and never throughout (John Abraham was rich in Zinda and he looked rich throughout). The movie never explained that why Vikrant Raina & his wife were divorced for 8 years? and why Vikrant Raina is afraid of water? The biggest mistake is the running length which was 2.5 hours and there just wasn't enough to make it that long and it certainly felt longer than that. The only memorable scenes were the animated sequence at the start, the chase scene on the rooftop and the nightclub near the end.The Music is really good although it is really difficult to produce a collection of commercial songs for a thriller that is based around a kidnap. The best song is the gritty Mit Jaaye.Overall it was O.K to be watched once but it didn't' live up to my expectations." 
" Not as bad as people stated! Was pretty good!","OK first of all, I actually liked this movie.. yes liked! It had a unique story and elements of suspense and such that made it so exciting. The only thing that was the downside was the leading lady, Minissha, who didn't really suit her character.. I felt like all she did was scream and her acting wasn't that great. But that didn't keep me from liking the movie, overall.. the movie kept me hooked on the entire 2 1/2 hours. To be honest, the heroine was the only thing that bothered me and she was only in the movie like barely half the time so that wasn't a big deal. The other aspects were pretty good! So if you're not too critical about every part of a movie and just want to see an entertaining thriller.. go see kidnap! p.s. im not a producer or any part of the movie... lol... just thought i'd mention that... im just a regular teenager!" 
" Watchable But Could Have Been Better.","What can a father, who is filthy rich, do if his daughter, who he hasn't seen for eight years and then one day he finds out that she's been kidnapped? Simple! Try and find out where she's been held and by who and try and find out the ransom amount and pay. But no, its not that simple as it involves someone who is out take revenge.Imran Khan has definitely grown up from his first movie and to match his character, he has done workout in the Gym and has shown it. He is the saving grace for this film and has matured. The same cannot be said for "Munnabhai," Sanjay Dutt  no doubt in my mind that he is a good actor but he could have performed better. He has played the role of a father before in "Pitaah," but playing the role of a teenager's father could have taken it to stronger position but never the less, not a bad attempt. Rahul Dev, in the meantime, has done a good job of his role in helping the helpless father.Actresses nowadays can stoop to any length in a film, including exposing and unfortunately for Minnisha Lambha, she has turned to exposing a bit, which I thought was unnecessary. But I can't say the same for Vidya Malvade as she has definitely performed well as a mother. Lastly, there was nothing much for Reema Lagoo, who I felt was wasted when her role as a grandmother could have been improved.This is not the same Sanjay Gadhvi, who has now separated from Yashraj Films, who previously directed hit movies such as "Dhoom" and "Dhoom2." The script was weak in many parts and this is perhaps the reason why he was not able to do better. The script could have been improvised and this would have made the film a bit better. Something to watch out for is the chasing scenes between the father and Kabir as they are very well filmed. I have been informed that for one scene, Imran Khan actually tried to perform a dangerous stunt himself only to receive a call from his uncle Aamir after Munnabhai gave him a call and informed him.Conclusion: This is a watchable movie but it could have been better."
