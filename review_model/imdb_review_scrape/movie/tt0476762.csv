" oh god...","OK, if you are going to make an action flick please try and concentrate on the script. The action sequences are also something that makes one laugh out loud...Fake! The script is bogus with many plot holes. This film could have been OK if they concentrated on the script and had more realistic action sequences. Sunny Deol needs to start acting in some better movies. This and Teesri Ankh absolutely suck. When I was watching this movie(Big Brother) i wasn't really expecting much since the reviews were disappointing. I was just expecting an action film. This movie got boring very quickly. Their in nothing really original. One guy after all the goons and villains. The hero whooping ass left and right. You also have the politicians and the love sequence. From the first 20 minutes into the film, you already know what is going to happen. The dialogues are also really disappointing due to the lack of originality. Everything is just so fake. Even the acting is below average. Their is either a happy or an angry sunny deol...Nothing else. Priyanka Chopra hams as well as Farida Jalal. Everyone is horrible in this film. The direction, screenplay and story are all below average. BIG disappointment!" 
" Good action movie!","Big Brother (formerly Deodhar Gandhi) is a good action movie! Only Sunny Deol could pull this one off well. Big Brother is truly the 21st century Ziddi with lots of action (not as explosive as Ziddi but good anyways) and a different plot. Action is good for the most part (a little toning for special effects could help). This movie is a surprise hit at the BO as it really does carry a social message. Recommended for all action fans (especially all Sunny fans)!! I can give this a 9/10! Some things could have been different, but Sunny fans will like it! I look forward to many more great action movies for years to come. All the best Paaji!!" 
" Stale","There were several Sunny films lying in cans during 2000 period after 2002 when he gave a series of flops. Big Brother starring him with Priyanka Chopra who debuted with him in THE HERO in 2003, The film was in cans for long time. The film has nothing you haven't seen before, It has Sunny Deol in a role straight out of Ziddi where too he plays a one man army. The film has stunts that look so stupid like Sunny digging one guy in the mud, or another guy after being hit flies and goes through buses. Of course such action is accepted nowdays in South remakes or films by Salman Khan but in this film it looks ridiculous Also to see an aged Sunny as a youth and paired opposite Priyanka is a joke. Farida Jalal is a few years older to him but in the film plays his son. The film is really stupid and outdated.Direction by Guddu Dhanoa is nothing great Music is staleSunny Deol just repeats himself, Priyanka Chopra gets no scope, she annoys in such roles, Farida Jalal is typecast, Govind Namdeo, Danny and all are typecast"
