" A movie from the heart.","I saw this with my family in a theatre. Superb film.
Found the movie to b a bit drag at times. No overacting by Srk this time. I ain't no fan of Srk but in this movie he was decent. He got into the character this time. Kajol was good. The flood scenes were a bit cheesy n unnecessary. Nonetheless a decent watch. It deals with racism, loss, stigma about a particular community, communal hatred, hope, perseverance.
If you want your life to be rocked go see it. A really wonderful film which should not be missed. Don't be put off because it is an Indian film, this is much better than "copycat BARFI" and much more worthy of Oscar nomination which it has missed." 
" Mr and Mrs Khan","My Name Is Khan is without a doubt Karan Johar's most accomplished work to date - powerful, moving and involving. Johar seemed to have learnt a lot from the previous feedbacks he must have got for his films. At times it was difficult to believe it was actually directed by Johar and written by Shibani Bathija, who finally proves her talent as a writer. The film is thoroughly realistic and the evident attention Johar paid to the smallest of details is commendable. The film does get sentimental at places, but it never goes over-the-top and remains fairly restrained and completely authentic, which makes the emotional impact on the viewer much stronger.The film is traditionally a love story more than anything else, but the ever relevant message behind it is wonderfully conveyed through such terms as innocence and guilt, kindness and inhumanity, truth and untruth, justice and injustice, love and hate. All these antonyms intelligently swap places through the story of innocent civilians accused for no fault of their own post the 9/11 attacks. The result of this tragic incident made the lives of so many of them miserable. This was really tough viewing.That's where our hero, Rizwan Khan, is thrown. He suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, he's different, he's naive, he takes every word literally, but he is intelligent and talented, and his perception of life is as his beloved mother taught him: the world includes only two groups of people â€“ good people who do good and bad people who do bad. This is so overly general yet so very true. The memory of his mother follows him always, and it's easy to see why. The portrayal of Rizwan's childhood is amazing. His relationship with the love of his life, Mandira, a young and vibrant single mother who works as a hairdresser and who ultimately agrees to marry him, is totally charming.The narrative style is exemplary. The serious proceedings are flavoured with humour, romance and some wonderful songs. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy create another magical soundtrack and give life to the film with such tracks as "Sajda", "Noor-E-Khuda" and "Tera Naina Re". The fact that songs are playing only over montage sequences letting the actors no chance to lip-sync in a true Hindi film style, is appreciable but I, for one, at points really missed the glamorous and colourful numbers from Johar's previous films, the more so as it stars Shahrukh Khan and Kajol after so many years.The film clearly works better in the first half. It is much more simple, light and enjoyable. The later half introduces the post-9/11 America with all of its disturbing images of discrimination, mindless attacks and murder. Johar's depiction of this phase is brilliantly done. From one side we have Rizwan who goes to tell the world of his complete innocence and his not being a terrorist, and from the other we see his wife Mandira who seeks justice post a very tragic incident of which she blames Khan himself.Khan's journey in the US is extraordinary. It unfolds in several episodes, each one presenting the different people he meets on his way: a motel owner named Jitesh, a lovely Muslim couple who offer him some food, a group of Islamists led by Faisal Rahman whom Khan reports to FBI in order to destroy their violent plans. The most memorable episode, however, is that of Mama Jenny and her son 'Funny Hair' Joel from the rural Wilhemina, Georgia, which is incredibly entertaining and heart-touching. The story of Mamma Jenny is moving, and Johar captures the spirit of the village and its people with skill. The gospel choir in the church singing "We Shall Overcome" is one of my favourite scenes in the film. That was unforgettable.Well, there comes the acting. Shahrukh Khan's appearance in this film in this kind of a role has been the subject of many discussions, and rightfully so. This is clearly one of his finest performances. He is phenomenal. It's amazing to see him transforming from the biggest star in the world into a simple autistic man and playing it with such conviction. His mannerisms, body language, tone, dialogue delivery and his occasional breaks into timid and embarrassed laughs are all spot on and make his character extremely likable and endearing.As expected, he is totally matched by Kajol, whose charismatic nature, easy charm, evident experience and strong screen presence all rally here into one heartbreaking performance that is replete with authenticity, maturity and strength. As Mandira, she looks incredibly beautiful and is as natural, intense and compelling as ever, playing the part with passion and depth and infusing it with energy and warmth. In some moments she outdoes herself. No, I'm not only referring to her powerful breakdown scenes (which are great), but also the many scenes showing her interaction with Khan. Note for instance the one in which she promptly decides to accept his earnest proposal. It's one of their best moments together.Johar selected a great supporting cast. Every actor, no matter how lengthy his character is, performs well. Zarina Wahab is outstanding in a brief but memorable role as Rizwan's caring and loving mother. Jimmy Shergill is very effective as Rizwan's brother Zakeer, who has always felt deprived by his mother because of his brother's mental disorder. Sonya Jehan is superb as Zakeer's wife Haseena and acts with grace. So is Katie A. Keane who plays Mandira's friend, Sarah. Tanay Chheda is first-rate as the young Rizwan. Jennifer Echols is lovable as Mamma Jenny.To sum it up, My Name is Khan is a fantastic film and an altogether worthy effort. It is fascinating, entertaining and it may definitely make you look at certain things differently. It is well written, directed and performed, and is beautifully shot. Deepa Bhatia's editing and Ravi K. Chandran's cinematography are also noteworthy. Kudos to all involved. Mr and Mrs Khan rock, I highly recommend you to see their story." 
" Enter into KHAN's Endearing World","This movie I got to say is the most endearing & has some superb performances from Shahrukh and Kajol.It is undoubtedly one of the most moving & meaningful movies which has been spurned out from Bollywood.Moving away from all stereotyped roles,acting,storyline, this movie places its flag of its own.All credits to Karan Johar for telling such a complex subject in such simple words.Brilliant cinematography,direction & performance makes this film worth watching not one but many times.The characters stay with you for a long time even after you leave the theater.SRK is Awesome in his acting along with Kajol supporting her character brilliantly.SRK never for once loses his grip on the character despite playing a patient of Asperger Syndrome which is one of the most challenging role played by any Indian actor or any Hollywood actor like Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.Go Watch this Soul-Tearing movie which forces you to re-think about the myths of religion,classes,communities & genders in which the human beings are classified every now & then.All this along with entertaining you all the way with some very cute funny scenes.Take the message from this movie & pass it along to everybody.This is what this movie deserves. A Gr8 movie.Must watch. 10/10." 
" King khan did it again","IF you believe that you have seen the best of srk think again. This movie will rock your world upside down and it will make you wonder how come an actor can make you fall in love with him every time he perform in a movie. the story, full staff of the movie every thing to the smallest details has been crafted as an unforgettable master piece that will live in the hearts and thoughts of audience for years and years to come. srk has raised the bar again giving all other actors and film makers a level that is hard to reach.As for the movie and the story i believe the best thing to do is for you to just watch it. personally when i got out of the movie theater i felt like to buy another ticket and get back to see it again that's how attached and obsessed i came with this movie. if you want your life to be rocked go see it." 
" You will fall in love with KHAN!!","I just returned home after the screening of MNIK and i had a blast! I just thought i should share my experience with all of you so here it goes...First things first it ain't a typical bollywood masala flick! It has India's most famous on-screen couple SRK-Kajol but it is not KKHH or DDLJ.... Directed by the supremely talented Karan Johar this movie is an absolute stunner!! In fact everybody(mostly were British) fell in love with SRK's character Rizwan Khan in the movie! Kajol has given a wonderful performance in the movie! I wont be surprised if this movie is nominated for Oscars! SRK plays Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism or commonly known as asperger's syndrome who is married to a single mother Kajol.. The movie deals with effects of 9/11 which shook the world! One man sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears.. The main highlights of the movie are SRK and the climax! Oh what a climax the movie has! You cant control but smile with lots of tears in eyes seeing the climax!! Once again SRK shows that he is not only here for comments and bad films(as people say)No movie in recent times has given so much of emotional attachment with the characters of the film!! The movie will become a cult classic for SRK fans and even those who hate SRK.. I wont spoil anything about the movie but i would say one thing: Wait for 12th Feb and book the tickets for the movie as soon as you can! And believe me it will change your life completely(and don't forget to thank me later! :)! The movie will break all records and set new trends in film making) For the people in India i feel lucky to have seen the movie before you but don't be disappointed! Better late then never!! I repeat whenever you will watch it your life will change completely!!This movie deserves a full 10!!Thanks and Regards!" 
" Rizwan Khan, the world's worst salesman","Mandira tells Rizwan she'll buy 6 hair products from him but he tells her he'll only sell her four because the remaining two will go to waste. He may be the world's worst salesman but he's the best human being. This is Rizwan, an innocent, clean hearted, simple guy who believes there are only two types of people in this world; those who are good and those who are bad. The reason for his innocence and candidness is due to the Asperger's Syndrome. You see he may be different but he definitely isn't stupid, in fact I believe we can all learn from him.The plot of this film is well known so I won't bore you with too much detail. This film is essentially a love story between Rizwan Khan (Shahrukh Khan) and Mandira (Kajol). However due to the events of the time their relationship is destroyed and Rizwan innocently sets out on a journey to clear his name.When watching the film you'll see Karan has once again used flashbacks to portray his story but this is not your typical Karan Johar film. It is clearly more realistic than his previous films and I must say he has matured well.The first half is focused on the Rizwan-Mandira love story. And it is done in a style that only Karan could do. I am a big fan of his previous "young" love stories but he is even better in this mature, realistic portrayal of "love at first sight". He makes us feel what Rizwan feels through his direction.My only problems with this film are in the second half when it begins to get more dramatic. And SRK mentioned himself that he wished the film was handled in a different way. And I completely agree with him. Where the first half succeeded in being fluent and tightly knit, the second half begins to become more far-fetched and loose. And I blame this on Shibani Bhatija. In terms of cinematography, you've got to give it to Ravi K Chandran, the film was filmed beautifully. The locales were very pleasing to the eye, were not over-powering and used simply as a back-drop. Coming onto the extras, I think this is possibly the only Bollywood film that has managed to correctly use English speaking actors and not turn them into caricatures or use fake dubbing. And for once, these extras can actually act! They have been used brilliantly and are totally believable.The supporting cast is flawless, they are relatively unknown actors (apart from Jimmy Shergill) and this is effective in making the story believable. They give heart-felt performances that compliment the lead actors.Coming to the lead actors... Rizwan Khan is without a doubt my most favourite character from any film. His sincerity and innocence is heart wrenching and there is only one man who could have done justice to this role and that is Shah Rukh Khan.Is there any role this man cannot do? He's done it all and yet he can still leave us gob-smacked. While watching the film I was in awe. In the scenes where Rizwan is faced with some sort of confrontation or hard- ship, he goes back into his shell and finds comfort in his religion. SRK makes you feel Rizwan's loneliness and confusion of how the world can be the way it is. When Rizwan is happy, you feel happy; when he is sad, you feel sad; when he is hurt, you feel hurt; and when he is confused and lost, you feel like reaching out and protecting him. I could keep going on about Rizwan and SRK but I would not do them justice, you have to go see the film to realise what I mean.I'm so glad to see Kajol back and especially with SRK. Their chemistry in previous films has created history and they do it once again in MNIK. She compliments SRK so well because she is a great actress herself. Look out for the outburst at Rizwan that has been mentioned so many times and her breakdown just before that. THE greatest actress Bollywood has ever had, periodGo watch this film now and I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Shah Rukh Khan alone will make sure of that. I myself am going to go watch it a few more times and I can't wait!" 
" A movie from the heart.","There are only two kind of people in the world:GOOD people who do good things and BAD people who do bad things.In this world where the definitions of good and bad are changing everyday by those who are in power and those who want the power, most of us just go with the flow and believe the values which are most convenient to us.But there exist some people who are gifted(or cursed;depends on your point of view) to see things as they are without their interests hindering the view of their souls. One such soul belongs to the protagonist of this movie who will touch your heart for sure.Without giving any details and spoiling your experience I would like u to go and watch this movie without presuming anything.I am not saying that it is without flaws:you may find the lead actress a bit too shrill at times, the editing a bit finer and the background score too loud in two or three scenes but watch this movie for its intent and its message that there is nothing in this world which holds as much power as an emotion:LOVE." 
" Religious and cultural tolerance","This movie has such an important theme and had a huge impact on me. In this part of the world, religious intolerance is evident, especially with the minority I can from. America needs to KNOW that not all Muslims/Arabs are terrorist. You claim religious tolerance and indifference when in fact you are blinded by your own grief and misjudgment. Please let this movie change that, and become an eye-opener not only to cultural and religious tolerance in the US but all around the world, including in Egypt. The main idea is reiterated in the movie over and over again - there are only good people and bad people - there is no other difference. Brilliant movie!" 
" KHANtastic movie !!","This is one of the best Bollywood movie I've seen so far. MNIK is awesome. Its a must watch for every human being. Its a movie for humanity. The way Shahrukh Khan has projected himself as an autistic patient is just awesome. Kudos to him. This is by far his best acting. After this movie, he has proved why he is called The King of Bollywood. He is in a league of his own. No one is even close to him. I have loved the movie. You will not be able to take away your eyes for a single minute in this 160mins movie. This is just fabulous. Kajol as Mandira was awesome too. She had played an excellent character and supported SRK very well. Their chemistry is to die for. Few moments in the movie will make you cry. The way he goes to an only Christian event and donates the money and says "Take this money for the Africans who are not Christians, darling" is awesome. This movie will be an all-time blockbuster. Go and Watch this movie !!" 
" Bollywood's version of America Post 9/11","As a middle school teacher, I think there aren't many better movies for showing how 9/11 effected our migrant community. The movie is a bit broad, and it is definitely not flag waving, but it tackles real issues, and is emotionally taxing. The lead actor is very, very popular in South Asia, Africa, and China. Many of my students whose parents are from other countries easily recognize the actor. My students are at a point where they are very concerned with others opinions, and are not sure of their place in the world. This film allows my students to empathize with other cultures. It makes my students whose parents are foreign feel less alone. If you are looking for a great American drama, this is not it. If you want a window in to how the rest of the world lives, views America, and how they sometimes feel left out, this is it. I have yet to have a parent, a student, or a fellow teacher watch it and say, "blah"." 
" Welcome to the Khan's world!!","Welcome to a new world: Rizwan's world! There is no religion in his world only good people and bad people! He suffers from a form of autism; asperger's syndrome but that doesn't stop him from differentiating between good and bad and mind you he is a genius and has a pretty good memory.. He doesn't hesitate in saying the truth and is always ready to help and love others.. He says the Khans don't break their promise! He hates yellow color and says the use of mobile phone will kill bees and eventually human beings!This movie isn't a copy of New York or Kurbaan as people say.. In fact this is the only movie in recent times with a super strong message.. The music is soulful and gels along with the movie very well.. Cinematography is top notch! Hats off to Karan Johar for his marvelous direction and special accolades must be given to Shibani Bhatija for superb dialogues! But the man who deserves special kudos and a standing ovation is the king khan himself!! Forget Chak de! Forget Swades or forget anything you remember about him!! The moment you are out of the hall you wont be able to think SRK as a normal person... Funny but yeah he has acted so beautifully that you will only remember Shah Rukh as Rizwan! Yes Rizwan is his new name now!! Kajol was also good in her role even though she doesn't have a big role in the movie! Her sizzling chemistry with SRK is visible whenever the duo are together on screen.. specially in the song Tere Naina!He doesn't care what problem is he in or how famous he has become by doing those deeds which every human being should do! He only cares about a promise that he has to carry out in order to rebuild his shattered dreams of a successful life.. He loves Mandira(Kajol) and her son very much and he is ready to do anything for them!! He never forgets anyone who helped him! All he wants is peace in the world and for every human being!!SRK is back with a bang!! My Name Is Khan will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will make you fall in love with Khan!! So please take my advice watch the movie as soon as possible!! My Rating 10/10Thanks and Regards!" 
" KHAN-tastic","Just back from the Mumbai Fox office after watching portions of the final edit of My Name is Khan. Fox guys were really keen whether the $16 million they spent in buying the rights are justified? The answer is a resounding yes. This film is gonna blow away mainstream Hollywood if properly marketed. Shah Rukh Khan is in the role of his lifetime and as Rizwan Khan, he is in his best performance ever. Kajol is at her usual best and the chemistry between the leading pair is something to die for. The climax is the crux of the movie, and the 2nd half is so compelling that people will just stand up and give a standing ovation to the maker, Karan Johar. Shibani Bathija needs to be credited for such an awesome screenplay, and Ravi Chandran's cinematography gives the film an international look. The theme is tailor made for North America, and as I already mentioned, if marketed properly, this one has potential to gross $20-30 million in North America alone. Having said that, being primarily a love story, it has all the right items to hit the Indian box office. Due to the lead pair coming back after 10 years, the hype in India is inexplicable. Overall, I would give it a 8.5/10 rating, and advise everyone to celebrate Valentine's with KHAN." 
" amazing......experience of my life!!!!!!!","Karan's take on the issue deserves the highest praise, since a subject like this is difficult to attempt. Final word? MY NAME IS KHAN is Karan, SRK and Kajol's best outing to date. Do I need to add anything more?A number of sequences are endearing. For instance, the romance between SRK and Kajol is subtle, yet charming. But it's SRK's relationship with Kajol and their kid that's one of the best parts of the movie. Your heart bleeds when an accident occurs and their lives are torn apart. Kajol's outburst â€“ first, when her son meets with a catastrophe and second, when she confronts SRK â€“ are truly shattering.MY NAME IS KHAN mirrors the era we live in. Not a day goes by when you haven't heard/read/watched news of terror attacks and innocents being killed. We live in turbulent times. Also, the movie states â€“ and states very strongly, without mincing words â€“ Not all Muslims are terrorists.There's just one word to illustrate Karan's direction â€“ exemplary. One of the finest storytellers of our generation, he deserves brownie points for deviating from 'Karan Johar brand of cinema' and attempting a film that knocks on your heart and stimulates your mind. With MY NAME IS KHAN, Karan takes rapid strides as a storyteller.On the whole, MY NAME IS KHAN is a fascinating love story, has an angle of religion and a world-shaking incident as a backdrop. It not only entertains, but also mesmerises, enthrals and captivates the viewer in those 2.40 hours. At the same time, a film like MY NAME IS KHAN is sure to have a far-reaching influence due to its noble theme...MUST WATCH!!!" 
" MNIK Screening","I was able to see the first screening of MNIK. With a lot on Karan Johar and Shahrukh Khan's shoulders, I must say the film exceeds all expectations and My Name Is Khan will deliver internationally. Shahrukh Khan known for his commercial romantic roles steps outside his boundary with My Name Is Khan and delivers a magnificent performance. Opposite him you have Kajol who matches Shahrukh Khan step by step. Direction, editing and visuals are all A rate. Not sure who gets credited for the story; Shibani or Karan. My Name Is Khan should lead Bollywood to international fame. All we need to do now is wait for February 2010." 
" a personal view","The story of Rizvan Khan a Muslim man with Asperger's syndrome who in fact one of the most beautiful human beings I could think of real or fictitious, perfect by design and world view nothing else. His story is one of simple understanding, love and devotion. I believe that the first scene in which we meet Khan, first searching the presidents travel itinerary and then packing his belongings for this unknown trip. There is no indication at first about his disability, then in line to board the flight he is detained for two reasons, one he is acting oddly and speaking in a foreign tongue and because he is also very strikingly in resemblance to a middle eastern Muslim, which he is. This scene is set up by daunting music suggesting something malicious might be about to happen. Once he is detained you are able to see the process in which he is searched, they only find the things he needs for his journey, identification of him as a special needs individual and his itinerary of the presidents travels. Khan is interrogated briefly by men who are obviously making a joke at his expense and they despite their racism are inclined to let him go because they understand his threat is very little as they can witness. I believe this is a demonstration of them being law abiding despite their racism is a foreshadowing to the tone of the movie. Showing Khan as a main character through his interrogation and examination but also telling about his and his special needs but also speaking to his, although limited in some sense, understanding of the world through which he builds his life and pursues his goals. I believe the setting is very important from an area of conflict where Khan learned about good and bad people in the midst of Hindu/Muslim riots in which he learned the basis through which he would judge all people for the rest of his life, with very good examples of what is and what is not. After his move to San Francisco he receives his American education and is also exposed to modern psychology through his sister in-law who finds his diagnosis. This is important because San Francisco which is the place where many criminals were sent historically but also where there was a large rate of acceptance of people who were discriminated against such as gays and many other racial groups who historically and still seek residence there where they might be accepted. I have noticed that a song or sound that has been implemented in the movie to indicate something is called Tere Naina, this song is played all through the process in which Khan and Mandira are getting to know each other through his sales of his brothers product and then after when they become friends and start to see each other outside of the salon where Mandira works. This song is supposed to be indicative of the love which is developed and shared between them throughout the movie. This relationship being an exact illustration of Khan's character, beauty and love no matter which differences are fabricated for them by the world they see nothing that should hold them back from their blossoming romance and relationship. There are several grouping themes in this movie; the most important one is identified in the beginning of the movie is when his mother tells him there is only good and bad, no Hindu and Muslim, no white and colored. There are obvious examples of good Muslim through Khan versus the bad extremists, good white family versus the bad white people who don't understand or support him trying to share in the memorial ceremony as a Muslim. There is also his brother who believes Hindus are a threat to Muslim way of life but he tells his brother there is no good Muslim, bad Hindu only good person and bad person. There is also good and bad FBI representatives good is the minority woman who gives his psych evaluation and bad is the man who tortures and interrogates him. Good women and bad women, good men and bad men. The one thing I did notice is that the majority of the people who help him are minorities or happen to be educated about his condition, such as the women from the center who did his diagnosis in the autism center, the wife of his brother who teaches at a college, the FBI psychiatrist. I believe that there is an overarching idea of American ignorance throughout the movie. This ignorance causes more suffering than the actual attacks on the world trade center not only for the people who are suffering because of direct loss but those who are involved in hate crimes such as the ones perpetrated on Sameer Khan, first when his locker is stuffed with photos of Osama Bin Ladin and then again when he is killed because he is beat to death. There are many other minorities which there are hate crimes filmed from the shop owner to the motel owner to the wife of his brother. All of which are assaulted by people who are scared and hurting and all the while there is propaganda giving false ideas about the Muslim faith from public schools to the news and other public news media sources. I gained a better understanding of why in fact the Muslim faith tradition is one of love, from Khan quoting directly from the two religious books the Hadith and the Qur'an in order to reinforce the love he showed to everyone. As a further demonstration there is the scene where he travels to Wilhelmina Georgia in order to be with and help save Mama Jenny and Funny Haired Joel." 
" awesome...","delivers everything with simplicity... a standing ovation to SRK for the way he has acted a movie which delivers a message that humanity is everything and not religion....... people should not be judged by their religion....and u can't just stop loving Rizwan KHAN(not SRK) he has done such a wonderful work u will get lost in him....it is undoubtedly one of the finest movies to come out of Bellwood in recent years....and not only SRK everyone has done excellent work in this movie....you cannot miss the SRK-KAJOL chemistry it's so refreshing to see them together again....everyone can take it as a valentine gift....music is very good it takes the story forward and not like other Bellwood flicks in which songs are added forcefully... so in my view it's an awesome movie which is honest and simple in every aspects..."
