" Funny & Heartwarming!","I'm constantly amazed at how negative and hostile some reviewers are when a film is happy and lighthearted. It's as if these angry, miserable people can't stand seeing other people have fun.Dil Bole Hadippa is one of my favorite Bollywood films precisely because it doesn't take itself seriously. While Rohan, played by Shahid Kapoor, was a bit melodramatic as the hunky cricket captain, I think it was a perfect "straightman" act for a zany comedy.Meanwhile, Rani Mukherjee (Veera/Veer) was hilarious and brilliant as the tiny yet talented all-rounder bats(wo)man with big dreams. She did a wonderful job dancing and singing both as a man in the "Lions of Punjab" number, and as a beautiful woman in the other songs.One of the other reviewers compared this film to She's The Man, and although the theme is similar, the Indian version has its own unique charms. So what if it's been done before? How many times do we keep seeing new versions of Pride and Prejudice or some other "classic" story? This film tackled some important themes such as giving women a chance to fulfill their dreams even when it hasn't previously been a traditional role. Another significant theme is how your dedication to, and faith in the Divine can manifest in realizing your dreams. And lastly, the most important theme of love - for family, for one's heritage, and for your true love makes Dil Bole Hadippa a film worth watching again and again. Hadippa!" 
" A Sixer!","I have to admit i did not have a lot of expectations going for this film because it looked like it was going to be a tried and tested formula trying to be another chak de India or lagaan. However this film was VERY entertaining, great acting, great dance, great songs and the film was very energetic. If you like masala bhangra fun type movies go for this one-its very JOKEY amazing i just saw it today at Roy Thomson hall i was fortunate enough to be part of the first ever audience in the world to see it. All in all a very entertaining film which is a tribute to what bollywood is all about, some fabulous acting by rani and shahid who shine in their respective roles and a film that will want you to get out of your seat and say 'Dil bole hadippa!"" 
" Awful","I was surprised to find positive reviews of Dil Bole Hadippa here as I always refer to IMDb for unbiased reviews. So now that people liked DBH, I realize that if I didn't like this movie and rather found it pathetic, probably something wrong with me but still posting my own reasons. To me, it was extremely melodramatic, loud and shallow stuff for this age. I cannot tolerate the century old "Wrong English" comedy any more. It is too much clichéd. Their cricket was one of the most irritating parts of the movie. I mean in cricket, it doesn't have to be a six, a four or a clean bold on every ball. And please YRF enough of conning your audience with the same Punjab di Lassi or Sarson ke Khet.And how all the bindaas girls end up changing Shahid's thoughts and perceptions of life like Geet of Jab We Met and Veera of DBH was also not digestible. The worst part was DDLJ and HAHK drama. I walked away for a few minutes. Nothing was new the same old modern girl vs Gaun ki gori and bindaas vs polished, desh vs pardes. Not a single dialogue made me laugh or even smile for a moment. Rani is a very talented actress. She should choose intelligent multiplex movies. My Vote: 1 Comment: Awful" 
" Enjoyed The Music and Dancing In This One","I don't know anything about Bollywood movies or any of the finer points of Punjab dramas, etcetera. I'm just an average middle aged Caucasian American who likes cross cultural experiences. I watch movies from different cultures to get an idea of the hopes, dreams, values and morals which are reflected back via the movie. Having been to India a few times, I am getting more and more familiar with Hindu culture.Admittedly, there is nothing new in the storyline here (think Shakespeare's Twelfth Night), but the actors are very attractive and actually quite talented dancers. Yes, the singing is dubbed, but I enjoyed the songs for the most part. Some of the movie is so stupid that I actually enjoy it as 'bad art'.I am not going to be a regular consumer of Indian movies, but this is a fresh scrubbed, if cynical, offering. I like it. I really like watching this movie." 
" DBH deserves to be run out without facing a ball","I checked DBH out against my best instincts. To be honest, I was lulled into it by a masterful Shahid performance in Kaminey. I was so wrong.The movie is terrible in terms of pretty much everything except Kapoor - who is reduced to playing a supporting role. Everything else is way below average in this movie. The script is typical YRF fare with a utopian Punjabi theme with its cast of annoying characters. The movie caters to romantic refugee notions of Indo-Pak friendship centered around an annual cricket game. The game is played by teams sponsored by two old friends who learnt to play cricket and woo girls at the same time in pre-partition Punjab played by Anupam Kher (India) and Dilip Tahil (Pakistan).However, even assuming the dudes were 15 in 1947, they would be 77 now. However, both of them look like they are in their early 60s - and one has even managed to score a ravishing, if estranged, Poonam Dhillon for a wife. That anomaly aside, the sporting nature of the contest is tarnished because the Pakistani side keeps winning - and is led by an arrogant captain. Shockingly, he gets his comeuppance at the end.So Kher invites his England-bred son (Kapoor) to construct a team worthy of representing the India pind (village). Unbenkownst to them, a superstar lives in their midst - only it's a girl (Rani Mukherjee, who else). She routinely challenges men and hits them for 6 sixes without pads, gloves (a cup was not necessary for obvious reasons), helmet while still in her salwar kameez. She also introduces the concept of switch-hitting to cricket - 5 sixes right-handed and 1 left-handed!!! (Anyone who follows cricket probably knows that this has happened about 4-5 times in all forms of cricket. So I am not even going into the credibility of the cricket action in this movie.) At the same time she manages to provide support for a local drama company singing, dancing and doing sundry back-stage tasks. Quite the ambidextrous all-rounder you would think already. But there's more.The young scion wants to set up a cricket team from scratch. Rani predictably shows up as a woman first but is denied entry much the same way Gandhi was tossed from the train in Petermaritzburg. Only this is Bollywood, so they show a procession with a Goddess passing by and all the men bow her heads to her while treating Rani like an outcast. Oh the ironic tragedy! So given her acting prowess, Rani transforms her Veera into Veer with the help of facial hair and contact lenses. Given her 6-hitting talent, she makes the team after a minor hiccup. However, when she is Veera, she keeps making an impression on the young NRI Kapoor who is also being wooed by a short-skirted bimbo who does not know her Indian (agri)-culture. Obviously, the earthy Rani wins his still Indian heart.Anyway, romance blossoms over a couple of Punjabi songs and we are on to the match. All goes well until Rani takes a blinder of a catch by Indian standards and everyone jumps on her. At this point a contact lens falls out and is noticed by Shahid who loses it, allowing the opposition to get from 46/5 to 216 in about 12 overs! Quite the meltdown - and a phenomenal run rate. I am sure some of the viewers (anyone with an IQ above 45) will wonder how he wasn't able to tell the difference before given that Rani makes no effort in voice modulation or even covering up her figure. And suddenly when the lens fell out, all was clear! So of course, Rani isn't allowed to open the batting, and it is left to an impassioned father-son bonding moment over the drinks break with 8 wickets down to retrieve the situation. It ends with a rousing speech that does little for women's lib and even less for the movie.I gave the movie 3 stars out of 10 - mostly for Shahid who holds his end up with a Dravid-like performance. Rani has a couple of moments, but fizzles out in trying to dominate the movie - a la Sreesanth. She is terribly miscast as a Punjabi girl - much like the fast bowler from Kerala. Kher plays the YRF Punjabi father perfectly. Although, he has had tons of practice. The rest of the supporting cast has little to do.The script and direction are both terrible. Every time Rani bats, we are subjected to "Ek Onkar". As a Punjabi, I found it extremely patronizing and almost offensive. And this is just one nugget. The juxtaposition of the mini-skirted bimbo vs. the rustic salwar kameez hearkens back to the days of Manoj Kumar. All we needed was an evil vamp who was divorced (OMG, the stigma!) who had convinced Dhillon to leave her husband who had actually broken his promise - not on stamp paper though.The dialog writers should start seeking alternative employment almost immediately - although I suspect they already have day jobs. The conversations in the movie are banal and lack any sort of genuine Punjabi flavor. Even Love Aajkal - a masterpiece by comparison, but a terrible movie when viewed absolutely - had more convincing Punjabi dialog.All in all, the movie doesn't know what's going on or what it's supposed to be. Much like the Indian team from the late 90s. If you are looking for a cricket movie, go watch Iqbal or Lagaan. If you're looking for a Punjabi-centric movie, go watch Oye Lucky or even Singh is Kinnnnng. However, if you are in that masochistic frame of mind, do go watch DBH - for 10 minutes. Any more and you could actually harm body and mind. Make sure you have a safe word and a seat close to the exit." 
" Good Movie.","I was at the premiere of 'Dil Bole Hadippa!' at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film is a story about a girl going after her dreams to play in a big league men's cricket team. The film portrays a lot of Indian Punjabi culture and is very patriotic. Fabulous acting by Rani Mukherji playing double roles in the movie. Shahid Kapoor also delivered a brilliant role as the head coach of the cricket team. The film was well directed and produced. I personally did not like the music that much except for a couple of tracks. It is a relatively decent movie for family viewing. Overall, this was a well-made movie accompanied by a good story." 
" My favourite movie of 2009","This has got to be the best movie for 2009 hands down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was So funny, fun , entertaining ,romantic. Its a movie for everyone. So if you like comedy it has a lot of that. If you like sports it has that. If you like romance it has that too and if you like a couple looking really good together you got it!!!!1. Shahid and Rani look So So So So good together!!!!!!! The best couple ever!!!! 2. Rani was so funny and entertaining. 3. Shahid was so hot and played his character just right. 4. GREAT songs.And5. If you have not seen it.......... Go and watch it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This movie doesn't deserve a 5 it deserves 20!10 stars man!!!10 Stars!In one week i watched it more than 20 times!!! it is so good!!!!" 
" Good entertainment","I do not know why this movie got only 5.0. I personally liked the movie. Its a good, light-hearted movie with a known theme but a new message in it. Instead of blatant India/ Pakistan match, its about sex and gender. Surprisingly Rani looked good with Shahid (I was skeptical about it at first)..it was really nice to see this unexpected couple. Though this movie is a remake of the movie "She is the Man", I enjoyed myself thoroughly. Anupam Kher, Dilip Tahil, Poonam Dhillon were in cameos, but they did justice to their roles. I have no idea why this movie is rated so less, I really liked this movie. It's short, simple, feel-good family movie, to be enjoyed with a packet of popcorn. I would ask everyone to go and watch this movie. I am sure you will not be disappointed." 
" Funny, charming and not as copied as they say.","I, like some others, don't understand the poor ratings the movie has received here on IMDb. I am also a bit frustrated at how it's called a poor copy of American "She's the man". For anyone who's read some Japanese comics, it's obvious that "She's the man" is more copy of manga titles such as "Girl got game" and "Boku ni natta watashi" than Dil Bole Hadippa is a copy of She's the man. I love gender bender stories and have read and watched a lot, but I must say that Dil Bole Hadippa is one of my favorites so far. Most of all I liked the absence of any over the top triangle drama that almost always come with this type of story. I was a bit puzzled by Rohan's extreme reaction when Veera was first exposed to him, but other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. As a loyalist of gender bender plots - I say this is a must see." 
" A Good Entertaining One To Watch","Not having been able to watch much of the promos of this movie, I had little idea that this would be based on the game of cricket. But this was not like Yashraj's big hit two years ago, "Chak De India." A young and a fiery Punjabi person dreams of playing in a local cricket team. That person is good at batting as well as in everything else that has to do with the game but the problem is that the person is a female and at first she is not accepted. Then she decides to put on some make up and looks like a male and is allowed to join the team once she's proved her skills.Starring Shahid Kapur, Rani Mukherjee, Anupam Kher, Poonam Dhillon, Dalip Tahil and Sherlyn Chopra. Rakhi Sawant makes a brief appearance. This is directed by Anurag Singh and is produced by Yash and Aditya Chopra.Rani Mukherjee has performed well in this movie. She has also done well when playing the game as well and taking in the fact that she is capable of doing something that has not been achieved by all that many great batsmen of the world six sixes in a row. Shahid Kapur keeps on improving with every film that he has acted in and it is nice to see him in a Yashraj film. Anupam Kher and Dalip Tahil were also good in their respective roles as was Sherlyn Chopra but what made it so nice was to see Poonam Dhillon back on the screen after such a long time.The story is predictable and that, perhaps is the disadvantage that this film has and there are times that it makes one remember past Yashraj Film "Dil Walleh Dulhaniya Lejayenge" and also "Hum Aapke Hain Koun!" There are a couple of good songs and especially the title song that is worth listening.It may be predictable but nevertheless, it is a entertaining movie which does have some good laughter as well as romance in it. But for those who do not enjoy cricket, you may find it boring.I think I have only seen Sir Gary Sobers of West Indies hit six sixes in a row." 
" Dil Bole Hadippa - Review","Following the phenomenal success of New York, Yash Raj Films returns with the much anticipated 'Dil Bole Hadippa'. With many expectations and questions tied to the film. Will Yash Raj's winning streak continue after the success of New York? Will Rani Mukherjee be able to deliver an equally stellar performance as Veer and Veera? Is the Rani and Shahid Jodi's chemistry quotient high? The plethora of questions are answered with a resounding-Yes! Dil Bole Hadippa is a highly enjoyable, light-hearted family film with a theme that connects with one and all-Cricket.The film does give one a sense of déjà vu with the essence of a typical Yash Raj Film where you are taken back to the days of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Veer Zaara and many other Yash Raj classics. Dil Bole Hadippa is a light hearted romantic comedy which touches on serious issues in our society such as gender biases and inequality existent in society, but does so in a very light-hearted manner.Veera (Rani Mukherjee) lives in Amritsar with her Uncle where they coordinate for an Art/Dance show to make a decent living. Despite having a 'Nautanki' show where you have Shanno (Rakhi Sawant) stealing the hearts of all the men, Veera dreams about playing cricket in the big leagues with Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. In short Veera is a small town girl with big dreams and she eats, breaths and sleeps 'CRICKET'.Rohan (Shahid Kapoor) lives with his mom Yamini (Poonam Dhillon) in England. He's an all rounder for English County Team. Rohan is Indian at heart but is a foreigner outwardly. Due to unforeseen circumstance Rohan parents are separated but the bond between the father and son continues. Rohan comes back to India to help his dad Chaudhry Vikramjeet Singh (Anupam Kher) who has dream to win the Aman Cup (Peace Cup) but has been on a losing streak for the past 8 yrs. Rohan takes up the challenge to make winners out of the 'Indian Tigers'. Sheer circumstances turn Veera into Veer to break the barrier to fulfilling and living a dream and what follows is hilarious, touching and moving all in one breath.Will Veera be able to pull the double role 'Veer' convincingly without being caught? Will Rohan be successful in fulfilling his dad's dream? Will Veera finally achieve her dream of being a cricketer? Anurag Singh makes a confident directorial debut with Dil Bole Hadippa. From the first frame till the climax the director definitely delivers a promising debut venture. The emotional sequences are well executed and the comedic scenes are absolutely hilarious reflective of sincerity and immense maturity.The film could have been crisper in terms of editing and scripting. The film has its share of faults which make you wonder such as Why Shahid Kapoor who plays an NRI from England didn't have a British accent? Rani's speech where she is trying to convey a message to the crowd is not as compelling as it could have been. Furthermore, the film has a lot of resemblance with previous Yash Raj Films and may leave a segment of the audiences looking for something hatke a tad discontented.The film works because of the equation between Shahid and Rani. The two wonderfully complement each other and their love story is pinned not as a conventional candy floss tale but the story is told in a delicate manner. After the success of Kaminey, Shahid's portrayal as Rohan introduces a new age romantic hero.Rani fits the roles of Veera and Veer to the T! The body language and the right accent required to play a 'Bindaas' Sardarji is challenging to say the least but Rani pulls the character off with such ease, it is a stellar performance from the actress and should definitely win her many hearts and accolades. Rani as Veer makes you fall in love with the character so much so that you find yourself forgetting at times that it is actually Veera playing Veer.The supporting cast: Rakhi Sawant, Anupam Kher, Dalip Tahil, Poonam Dhillon, Sherlyn Chopra are first rate and add a freshness to the film. The music of the film by Pritam brings the earthy feeling of Punjab which is incorporated well with the story of the film. Ishq Hi Rab Hai and Discowale Kisko being the pick of the lot.The film should prove to be lucky for the Yash Raj Films banner. The film will be facing fierce competition at the box-office from the Salman Khan starrer, Wanted. Who emerges as the winner will be upto the audiences' verdict. Dil Bole Hadippa is a simple, inspiring tale of hope which makes one feel joyful and cherry and will your heart go Hadippa!" 
" Fun comedy, great performance, & interesting theme","Dil Bole Hadippa is a wonderful, light-hearted, escapist comedy! Most obvious and notable is Rani's performance--a free-spirited girl who can't be stopped from chasing her dreams. Her comic timing is brilliant, and her girl-next-door look suited the role just fine. Shahid Kapoor, the new big star still getting praises for his work in Kaminey, also is quite good. Rati Agnihotri is marvelous.A few minor parts are a bit filmi/too idealistic such as the over-friendly intermingling of the Indian and Pakistani villagers before and after the match (wish I'm wrong). The main concept/theme of the movie is quite revolutionary and may be difficult to digest. I certainly had never thought of it before. In sports, why are there separate teams for men and women? Shouldn't the goal be to have the best players?...regardless of gender? Before watching this movie, I used to think that, on average, a guy is more athletically capable than a girl. That's why there are separate teams to keep the competition level. Now I see that it is unfair to put a girl to an inferior level or standard just because she is a girl. Is our society too male-dominated for the male ego to accept that a woman can do better than or even as good as a man in something traditionally associated with males?" 
" Above average movie for sure","Ahh..Sorry but not that bad of a movie at all. If Sherlyn Chopra gets 3 stars then the movie certainly deserves 10 stars for sure..:) Sherlyn looks average. I agree movie is not exactly super hit quality, but above average and provides plenty of entertainment.It does have similar theme as the Hollywood flick, but pure Indian from start to the end with plenty of Punjab, Indian values and Indian style entertainment values.Way to go Yashraj Film, certainly not your best work but we enjoyed it a lot. The Lahore and Punjab cricket rival was cute concept.Certainly 10 times better then Akshay Kumar's junk movies." 
" This movie is basically the Bollywood version of She's the Man with Channing Tatum and Amanda Bynes.","This movie is basically the Bollywood version of She's the Man with Channing Tatum and Amanda Bynes. Your counterparts in those roles are Shahid Kapoor and Rani Murkherji respectively. The movie is pretty funny - the cheesy slapstick comedy that is trademarked Bollywood. I really enjoyed all the past movie references that occur throughout the film in both the dialogue and background movie choices, it really gave the impression that the movie wasn't a movie but actually a real life situation - which it is - but while never getting too serious. There were some sub plots that felt neglected and incomplete. But since this movie is almost 3 hours long you can get over that and just make your own endings for them. Overall a very enjoyable Bollywood style film." 
" Fun filled entertainment","I was surprised to how a typical tried out story actually entertained me and made me happy!. Great to see Rani back, her absence was felt and her return is ever so glamorous. Its great to see someone who can really dance match up with Shahid. Shahid is his usual serious self, and doesn't come through much in contact with the viewers, but his acting was tip top and enjoyable. The story was so colorful that i was laughing unexpectedly at times. The make up for Rani as a male was realistic, i actually know someone that looks like that. My only comment is the case of the disappearing and re-appearing eye shadow and make-up. As soon as she throws everything male off she checks in for seconds into invisible beauty salon and re-appears fully beautified :D. More or less very enjoyable and will own it on DVD, the music is lively and makes you want to dance the bhangra. And for you all women rights hater males who voted poor for the movie, let me tell you its not that she was a girl its that she played better than men (in the movie) so the image of weaker sex can't play with guys was abolished and nullified to the zennith.. thats why everyone with a sane mind clapped at the end." 
" I loved it - way to go Yashraj Films!!!!","Shahid perhaps jumped at the opportunity to work under YRF without bothering to even ask for the script. His character surfaces quite fickle-minded. Shahid however gives his best shot to infuse life into the character. For Rani its supposed to be come-back movie - why? When did she have a sabbatical on the first place? And didn't you know what the turn of events when Adi attempted comeback movie for Mrs. Nay-nay? Not being funny but her personality and height was not quite suited for the role of the Surd Veer Pratap Singh (somebody else with a strong personality and better height might have helped). Remember Padmini Kolhapure in Zamaane Ko Dikhana Hai? Rakhi Sawant can put in her resume that she worked in a YRF banner. Seriously, there wasn't an iota of contribution for her character. YRF perhaps incorporated as a marketing gimmick.Sherlyn Chopra - again an unwanted character who forces a nasal in the name of sensuous voice. And she hasn't improved a bit since Red Swastik.Anupam and Dilip Tahil were dependable. Cameo by Poonam was okay'ish.Whilst in "Chak De" the focus on the game was like fish-eye and there was no tom-foolery around there. Whereas in "Dil Bole Hadippa" there are too many plots::* Father-son relationship* Anupam - Poonam failed marriage* Rani's passion for the game* Shahid - Rani's romantic track* India - Pakistan milaapAmongst all these somewhere the game of cricket seems desperately hunting for its identity. The last 30-minutes of the writing is perhaps the worst it could possibly get. Sick is perhaps the nearest word that comes to mind looking at the movies churned out by YRF factory. Does anybody even bother to look at the statistics in there - hello? I wouldn't be surprised would beg their lucky mascot to salvage the Titanic. Its quite apt to quote Scar's words from The Lion King " I'm surrounded by idiots!".PS: Siddhart Anand in his "Bachna Ae Haseeno" paid homage to the self- obsessed producers "one & only and never again will be" movie and guess what? He was instantly rewarded with another movie. Well Mr. Anurag Singh no harm in counting the chickens before the eggs hatch. Adi - grow up boy!"
