" A Nutshell Review: Tum Mile","I had thought I was consciously going from one disaster flick to another, from the latest that Hollywood has to offer, to what Bollywood has on its plate. The trailer would have suggested that it's in line with Hanuedae with copious amounts of flood waters wrecking havoc on the man on the street, but this was actually quite the disastrous picture in itself.It's a romance story, with little time devoted to its gimmicky backdrop with the 2005 Mumbai flooding. Unlike similar plot devices in various disaster films, this one could have done away with its gimmick, but what would remain is an uninspired piece of romantic drama that neither sizzles nor touches, but contains every conceivable cliché offered by any mediocre television drama. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they fight and we find out whether they reconcile under a heavy downpour. Making things worst is that the characters have absolutely no chemistry, and you'd be rooting for them to stay apart since staying together had proved to be difficult.Emraan Hashmi continues to play the artist type as Akshay the painter (he was also a painter in Raaz: the Mystery Continues), who thinks the world of himself and refuses to compromise his art nor to eat the humble pie. He falls for rich girl Sanjana (Soha Ali Khan) and they decide to move in together in a swanky Cape Town apartment. Being without of a regular job, we know who will ultimately be forking out dough for bills, and this damages his big male ego. Multiple fights ensues, they split, and meet again some 6 years later, where the film began, aboard a business class section of the airline. Yep, ego boy finally made good, and is contemplating against his ego how to woo his lady love back, except that this time the heavens so wish to rain on his parade.The narrative gets told in flashbacks, which I thought the backstory would be over and done with by the time the intermission rolls along. Unfortunately not, as it continued to plod on. The story by Ankur Tewari failed to realize how to cut its losses once the appeal of the lovebirds no longer hold, and the focus could have been on how damaging the disaster is, no thanks to inept, lazy and incompetent staff at a meteorological station who seemed more concerned with who's making money from the in-house gambling table. Then again, perhaps the lack of a fat budget had prevented that aspect from taking place,and what resulted in were a couple of CG wide shots of the city drenched, and a couple of archived newsreels to tell you just how bad the situation is.For a set action sequence – check this – we have a bus turning slowly to its side in a manner which defies the laws of physics, just because a tree branch had punctured one of its windows, and it seemed like the end of the world for all on board, who had so far been mulling around just waiting for the rain, and the flood waters to stop and recede, which the latter did so under miraculous circumstances actually. And what about the inexplicable rush of a towering body of water into a building floor which is higher than what the level of water on the streets is currently, just to see capture sheer horror from the faces of our lead characters? And to top if off, some melodramatic moments you see coming from a mile with regards to water, and power cables.For what it's worth, Tum Mile could have been a wonderful comedy, but it decided to focus on the insipid relationship between two uninteresting couples in their tiffs and attempts at reconciliation. The result? A total washout." 
" Tum mile is a boring love story","Trapped in the deluge of 26 July, 2005, carefully navigating around half-submerged vehicles and dodging death on the flooded streets of Mumbai, Emraan Hashmi tells Soha Ali Khan that the first thing he's going to do when he gets home is watch Sholay. It is my humble suggestion that the makers of this film, Tum Mile go straight home and watch Sholay themselves. Some lessons in screenplay writing and basic shot-taking wouldn't hurt. A story of former lovers who part acrimoniously, then suddenly come face-to-face one day when everything and everyone around them is falling apart in the torrential downpour, Tum Mile is intended as a poignant drama about how a life-changing event makes this couple realise that they've always loved each other. The problem is there's not enough drama in the screenplay to begin with. The first half of Tum Mile is spent setting up the relationship between Emraan and Soha, who play Akshay and Sanjana, a struggling artist and a successful journalist in Cape Town. Over the course of an hour we watch as they meet, fall in love, squabble, and ultimately part ways. The deluge, by the way, is yet to come. Post-intermission, the action shifts to Mumbai where the couple is reunited years after calling off their relationship. Wading through waist-deep waters, Akshay and Sanjana contemplate their failed romance. For the next hour or so they yak incessantly, boring you to death with their supposedly-profound realisations. Where's the action, you ask? Well, there's hardly any. You do get one good scene in which they're trapped in a dilapidated building whose wall crumbles against the force of water, compelling them to race in the opposite direction. Ripped straight out of James Cameron's Titanic, it's the only exciting scene in this tiresome film. Tum Mile suffers also on account of its uninspired leads, Emraan Hashmi and Soha Ali Khan who appear bored out of their wits going through their scenes. They fail to strike up any romantic chemistry whatsoever, and perform so monotonously, you can't be blamed for disconnecting from their supposed pain. The film's special effects are unimpressive, and the photography is uniformly flat. I also want to point out in particular how unflatteringly Soha Ali Khan has been photographed. The actress ought to sue the film's director and cinematographer for how carelessly they shoot her. Tum Mile has a hummable score, but it doesn't succeed on most other counts.You may survive the floods, but Emraan and Soha's irritating dialogues will most certainly kill you!" 
" Excessive Romance and less of water.","Vishesh Films, Kunal Deshmukh & Emraan Hashmi trio is back with another romantic movie written around a plot based on real life. After his successful directorial debut in "Jannat", this time Kunal tries his hands on a (so called) disaster movie depicting the unforgettable trauma faced by Mumbai on 26th July, 2005. The tough days which are still fresh in the mind of every Mumbaikar, saw Mumbai in a very unimaginable state with a flood like situation leading to huge physical and monetary losses everywhere in the city.So obviously there were enormous expectations from the movie, coming from a director, who already had a well made realistic movie to his credit. Moreover, "Tum Mile" was also being projected as the first major attempt in the genre of "Disaster Movies" in Hindi Film Industry though its promotional campaign, TV Promos and Posters. But after watching it, you actually feel like cheated by its promoters because the film which was heavily advertised with the scenes depicting the Mumbai Floods, actually has only a few minutes talking about the disaster and too not in a very convincing way.It starts nicely with a well written in-flight sequence, where both Emraan & Soha get to meet each other after many years and remember the good times spent together in flashbacks. The movie moves ahead following the same pattern of "Jannat" wherein first the romance is established between the lead couple and then the real plot is revealed after a few romantic numbers. But in "Tim Mile", Kunal stresses too much on the romance part and pays very less attention on the disaster element which actually should have been given the center stage. Till intermission the narration keeps moving into the past and present lives of the couple and along with that also tries to establish the base for the Flood sequences. But the excessive emphasis on the romance part fails to create the required curiosity level, which is a must for a disaster movie. The strong build-up leading towards the watery climax is simply missing.Post interval, the viewer becomes desperate of watching the flood stuff and really wants to see how it is done in a Hindi movie, but he still has to wait till the end. The main over publicized rain scenes actually come only towards the climax and those too finish off too soon without making an impact with no worth seeing graphical creations as expected. In addition to this there is no account of any mass human suffering, pain or loss faced by the people due to that unexpected natural calamity. Though the flood sequences has been shot competitively in a street set which must have been a tough task for the whole team, but in the end it is too plain to make you feel for it.Otherwise, the movie has a good romantic story going on with a few good scenes and dialogues coming at regular intervals. Both Emraan & Soha have given good performances as required by an intense love story. They emote and relate well on screen. But Emraan now has to move on to some completely different roles in his career. He looks like doing the different & improvised versions of his own lover boy characters from his previous movies. Soha on the other hand gives a mature performance as a true lover caught between the choice of her career and love. Mantra, as Emraan's friend makes a good impact throughout and Sachin Khedekar is hardly there for only one scene.Hence, it all comes down to the wrong promotion of the movie, where it doesn't deliver what it promised. Also, the writing falters at many places which is clearly visible to the least interested viewer too. For instance, a person coming to check your Electronic Meter abroad in a pure Indian style, people moving out of a drowning bus leaving a small child alone, the child's mother is also shown out of the bus crying for help. The script also majorly fails to use the flood sequences resulting into the re-union of the lovers. After one hour, anyone can guess that the story will now end in the floods where Emraan would save Soha and they will both fall in love again. And that's where Kunal fails to make an impact this time. There is no surprise climax in "Tum Mile" which was incidentally one of the major attractions of his "Jannat".Musically, the soundtrack again has some good songs from the ever consistent Pritam. Though not as compelling and rich in lyrics, as his other recent hits, but still they sound good while watching the movie. However as usual, not all songs were needed in the script, which also needed crispier editing. Cinematography, Graphics and Art direction is fine, but nothing path breaking. In fact it is nowhere close to the other epic disaster movie "2012" which also releases this Friday. So, if you want to see a real disaster movie with breathtaking sequences and magical graphics on the screen then the choice should be clear after reading this.Rating : 2 / 5 (Blame it on the misguiding promotional campaign)" 
" I loved it.....","Great movie with superb acting according to me.One of Emraan Hashmis and Soha Ali Khans best performance so far. I really liked the realistic feeling I got watching this film.Reading most peoples reviews om IMDb made me believe that this movie will not be good at all. Ghosh I was proved wrong after seeing the film....a beautiful love story told in a great and different way. I cant believe people gave the movie 4.4...it deserves 8/10. I gave it 10/10 to improve its ratings =)I really cant believe how people prefer movies like Singh is king in front of decent movies like this.Don't miss it...its worth watching..Enjoy" 
" Jab I saw Tum Mile","Tum Mile is a thoughtful love story which I found very engaging, and aided by emotionally intense performances from the cute pair Emraan Hashmi & Soha Ali Khan. Even the songs were quite romantic & foot tapping.Talking more about the performances, Emraan was really cool. So also was Mantra, the actor who played Emraan's close buddy. It's unfortunate to not see his name in the cast details of this movie. Soha Ali Khan has also acted with caliber. However, she looked slightly aged in the closeup shots.The scenes of the monsoon floods in Mumbai as the backdrop of this love story was handled very well till footage of actual floods in Mumbai(the 2005 floods?) were showcased as the real thing. It looked very obvious that the shots were lifted from old television news of the actual floods in Mumbai. That took some charm out of this movie.Also, the end was unsatisfactory. It looked like a patch-up work because till then, I felt the story moved like a poem.Verdict - It could have been a soulful romantic drama but good show anyway. A 8/10 in my opinion." 
" complicating","Cant understand.Film is really boring.Just felt like my house was getting flooded" 
" Watch it for Love and Music","Emraan Hashmi is back with his trademark style to lure girls and pitch in their lives as easily as breathing. His movies are the best school for "How to win a women's heart" and Tum Mile also adds a little weight in this statement. Before talking about the storyline, firstly I want to give all the hail to wonderful wonderful music. Its very melodious and all pleasure to listen, and for sure Romanticism filled in aroma of the movie is because of that aesthetic music. Thanks Preetam for this wonderful music. Now come back to movie, it is all about an artist who is passionate and talented but a low on his pockets. The guy has big dreams to buy an art gallery for his father. Accidentally he meets a beautiful girl and falls for her in very first sight. With his typical fundas and idiotic and sometimes irritating attitude, Hashmi make the girl crazy about him. The relationship blossoms but as girl is very successful editor and guy is still struggling for his punch start, they create differences and broke up finally. Life takes a U turn when they meet in a flight to Mumbai after 6 years and flowers of love that actually never died in their hearts again spread the fragrance in air. They land in Mumbai where rain is washing off the city completely. Here they meet again and in the shadow of that flood disaster situation the bond of love again shape up for them and brings them closer than ever.Movie is a little slow when both have spats near to interval time. Anyway love birds will love the movie for sure and music of the movie make couples hold their hands tighter. On an average a good flick from Bhatt camp." 
" What A Romantic Movie !","Tum mile best movie and especially the tracks of the movies are very melodious and very good music by pritam and lyrics are very good. Songs are cerry expressive and loved the songs. Best Movie Ever ;)" 
" Tum Mile: A disconnected film less on soul and entertainment","Movie: Tum MileRating: 1.5/5I generally don't watch films of Emraan Hashmi since they have often an A certificate and don't suit for family viewing. But since this film Tum Mile had a UA Certification, I decided to watch it. I found the film interesting in parts, but I didn't find a reason to love the film.Tum Mile is a kind of film that could have been entertaining as its own music. I really love the songs and I hear them a number of times. The music is truly the biggest plus point of the film. Not even a single song misses the mark. In the voice of K. K.the songs add soul to the film's entertainment quotient and.....sorry, sorry! I was reviewing the film and not the music!Coming to what actually the film contains, you find that the film is a simple love story narrated in a disconnected and confused way. The love angle and chemistry between the leading pair seems to be completely missing, despite of the love and pain they together depict in the songs. There are a couple of scenes that are dealt with very well, especially the interval scene, the climax scene and a few scenes which you will remember only if you really get lost in the film otherwise you won't even remember what happened in the film. I am unable to recall what I had watched.The technical aspects of the film are top notch. Cinematography is adequately handled and VFX seems quite good. But it's the disconnected storyline and the screenplay that makes you feel disappointed. Once the film starts off, and the romantic story is revealed, the narrative loses its grip and as a result, even it's own pace at which it was running. Emraan Hashmi is just OK, since he's not habitual of acting in such serious deglam dramatic films. Despite of the presence of Mantra, you don't get a moment to laugh, or even think about it. There are various moments where the film's pace breaks down and the entertainment level falls badly. However, the film manages to regain its speed in the climax. But till then, you find it to be too late.Overall, Tum Mile is an average romantic drama film that does not meet the expectations one makes from this film. Its music is the biggest and perhaps, the only plus point of the film. Otherwise, an average narrative, poor execution, lengthy plot and many other negative things kill the interest. Watch it only for the songs,otherwise, buy the original audio CD and enjoy the songs at home. If you really want to watch the film, then be prepared for some shocking surprises." 
" Titanic it is NOT!","This movie is not worth your time, trust me. This is what you get when Bollywood attempts to make a cross between Hollywood's 'The Day after Tomorrow and Titanic'. This is really a poor exploitation of the 2005 Monsoon/Maharashstra disaster floods. Watch it only if you are a fan of one of the two leads(Emraan Hashmi and Soha Ali Khan) and have to see all their films to complete your collection.You might find yourself hitting the fast forward button during some scenes but don't worry, you're not being impatient, the film is just really boring for the first hour and a half until the action starts." 
" Just another romance melodrama under the cover of a serious issue","I was one of the victims stranded for hours in the very same floods that this movie was supposed to portray. Believe me when I say no man that day would have been in romantic mood even if he met the girl of his dreams. But this is Bollywood which is very well known to dupe people by making movies on serious subjects and then change it into a pansy romance-comedy- drama...etc... Emraan Hashmi as usual was the expressionless + emotionless moron who gets the girl without much effort and chase (wonder why it doesn't work for me?). Soha Ali too didn't add much value to the film, well she is an old horse (cannot carry the entire movie on her shoulders when everyone is doing such a bad job). Don't watch it even if it was given to you for free." 
" Great Awesome Love Story","No doubt about acting. Always best at the acting and realized the love in the floods."
