" Wow!!!... Intellectual, Gallant and a Brave Factual work of Cinema... Caution: Miss This At Your Own Risk.!!!","It took 3 films and 7 years for Shoorjit Sircar (director) to deliver us with undoubtedly the best political thriller we can savor ourselves over a long time. 'Madras Cafe' is unarguably a gem of a movie that belongs to a rare genre of Bollywood cinema and deserves much more attention and applause than what it's being receiving.The film is based on the backdrop of the Sri Lankan civil war in the late 1980's and early 1990's. It crosses its path with the plotting and execution of the then, Indian Prime Minster, whom we understandably can make out as Late Mr. Rajiv Gandhi. This film is so well crafted; it was not possible to find out a loophole in the entire plot.John Abraham (Producer), who plays as a RAW Officer has done a 100% justice to his character Vikram Singh. There are noticeable fluent and honest performances from Siddharth Basu and Nargis Fakhri (Rockstar) on the other hand as well. If you want to know more about what's inside, you have to go and watch it yourself. Although just do a bit of homework on the Lankan civil war events that occurred in the late 80's. You would not regret it.There was one drawback of the movie though. The movie had an end. But as they say 'All good things comes to an end'. So, I guess it to be that way.Madras Café is a slap on the faces of all the directors and also on the ignorant and bogged down movie goers who are ardent worshipers of senseless commercial cinema that has plagued Hindi movie industry over the last year and half. John Abraham here has to be appreciated immensely for the effort he has put in out of the movie, since; there was no one who was ready to produce this movie earlier until he accepted this project to invest in.Thank you John Abraham and Shoorjit Sircar.Without any second thoughts, being thankful and much obliged with this Intelligent and brave cinema,.. I'm going with an esteem ★★★★★★★★★✩ (9.1/10) for Shoorjit Sircar's Madras Café. This one is a Must Watch.Watch and BE ENLIGHTENED..Cheers" 
" One of the best Political Conspiracy Thrillers... AWESOME !!!","Madras Cafe is super awesome, totally moved by this conspiracy thriller. The movie had no regular commercial elements, no songs, no romance, no sh*t. It was bang on target since the first frame of the movie. The whole content of the movie is totally legitimate. Director Shoojit Sircar should be appreciated for a brave attempt on showcasing the political conspiracy involved in the assassination. The direction was great, specially the scene involving the assassination. That was the best scene of the movie.Screenplay of the movie is very tight, It was fast paced, though there are no entertainment elements, The movie will not bore you. My a** got glued to the seat and eyes on the screen. John Abraham did a great job by selecting such kind of a movie. He did extremely well.Will definitely have a re re re re watch for this movie... LOVED IT !!!" 
" Probably the best movie of it's genre from the Indian sub continent","Probably the best movie of it's genre(spy/espionage/war/politics) from the Indian sub continent ever. Well researched, scripted and dramatized with a gripping pace and thrilling twists. Indian commercial movies normally have very faint reflection of reality or they go overboard in their desire to please all with more than a pinch of spice, item songs, super hero justifications and other indispensable Indian commercial considerations. But this one beats it all and yet retains the charm of a commercial flick. A perfect balance and a fine confluence of commerce and art,rarely seen in Indian cinema. A very strong script with probably the first ever peep into the working of Indian Intelligence Agencies and a panoramic capture of serious geopolitical subject with utmost honesty. A movie which remains true to the core yet maintains a edge of the seat drama through out. Not to be missed for the lovers of good Indian cinema, meaningful & superbly entertaining." 
" As good as blood diamond and green zone...","Madras Cafe is a political thriller which although claimed fictional, is inspired by real events. Its tells the conspiracy behind the assassination of ex-prime minister of India and the War situation in Baffna region of Sri Lanka...The movie is fast paced and is so intriguing and well-crafted that it can be easily this years best...With zero publicity stunts, Madras Cafe director Shoojit Sircar tries to go out of conventions and comes up with this masterpiece...Political thrillers are ones which people in bollywood rarely attempt, and Shoojit does it bravely...Right from the start, the plot involves you in such a way that it is hard to come out of it.The pace of the movie, entangled characters,series of events, unveiling of conspiracies and then finally the climax- all are up to mark and hence make this movie a spectacle to watch...The Screenplay is fabulous- it divides the movie in two parts efficiently. First, the war conditions in Baffna and then the assassination plot.In between shocking plots are revealed and it covers a vast script in its runtime.The reason why i compare this with Hollywood masterpieces like blood diamond and green zone is not because of the similarity, but due to the fact that Madras Cafe maintains the originality of facts while imbibing the fast paced and thrilling plot.John Abraham plays the lead role and this could be his best performance after dhoom, and does total justice to his role.Nargis Fakhri is the surprise package and shows that she can be versatile...The supporting cast is totally naive but they give their very best...The only drawback or error you can say is relatively average editing.Its cliché and too short for many scenes...But as a whole, Madras Cafe is a sinister, evil political thriller which is supported by intense acting and direction and the plot is simply ravishing.Its a sign that bollywood has started making sensible movies on a large scale.Madras Cafe is not for crowd who like Chennai Express,Rowdy Rathore or Dabang, but it for those who acknowledge movies like A Wednesday, Shanghai and Rang De Basanti. This one wouldn't be watched on a large scale, won't gross in hundreds of crores,will not receive flurry of awards...but for me its simply one the best that bollywood has ever produced..." 
" John and Shoojit team is much better than Ajay and Rohit Shetty.No fake actions no stupid jokes","Madras Cafe is not only one of the best releases but the only best release in this recent time. John is no more expression less actor.HE worked extremely hard in his recent projects and proved him.And he is at his best in Madras Cafe. Talking about Nargis her accent is good but should have done hard work on her acting skills. Thank God no Lungi dance at the end but a beautiful song called Maula sun mere. And then the Assassination. As we all know the end but it keeps us on the edge of our seat till the last scene Credits to Shoojit Sircar. Very realistic,great performances by everyone and great direction. They killed him .We lost him for no mistake.He was so young. This touches everyone Hearts......" 
" Trying hard, but ...","I'm a stranger to Indian cinema, other than being familiar with the usual clichés of Bollywood-style song, dance and drama.I read some reviews here, recommending this movie, and calling it a genuine political thriller. Well, it is. Sort of.It's hard to describe what I feel is wrong with the movie. The plot is believable, and you want to see more. Not being intimately familiar with the horrible history of the Tamils, and having read only scattered articles here and there, I did not have any way to determine whether the movie was true to facts or not, and for this I apologize.So, what's wrong? Well, it feels like there is an entire plot here. There is. But it feels like someone sat down, wrote a list of "what makes western political thrillers good", came up with 10-12 key scenes, and made those. Without really bothering too much with tying them together. It feels not so much rushed as uncohesive. And that's a shame, because ..The visuals are nothing short of stunning. Excellent camera-work, glorious colors, scenery, and almost worth watching for this alone.But ultimately, for me, the story is where the substance is. And in this one - perhaps this is due to me being unfamiliar with Indian cinema - it just feels cut to pieces and abrupt. Key events just "happen" from one scene to the next, and if you want to keep up with who's who, and who's pulling what strings, don't blink for a second.Given that I don't know the material intimately, like I would with say a WWII movie, or a typical cold-war spy movie, and the actors were all unfamiliar to me, this movie was hard to follow. Perhaps for a more local audience, it would be infinitely more enjoyable. I do hope so, because it is a gorgeous movie, and I desperately wanted to like it." 
" MY REVIEW: What a Cafe to be in!!","Madras Cafe is a kind of political and espionage thriller that Bollywood never tried before. First half requires your patience. It is a mix of striking visuals, haunting sound design, introduction of key characters, their motives and the felling that something is not right. Second half is a piece of cinematic perfection where characters gets meaty dialogs, feel of danger keeps growing and finally in the climax you feel helpless like our hero. Based on actual events mixed with fictitious characters, Madras Cafe becomes a very important movie that should be watched by every Indian. Acting is top-notch. You won't be able to forget the imagery of first half and tension of second half long after the end credit starts. Director Shoojit Sarkar provides the ample conviction and uniqueness to whole idea and surprises you with his versatility (he directed Vicky Donor before). The movie has little flaws like packing too much information in first half and few key details not described clearly. But I can say with full comfort that it would be a mistake if you give this movie a miss." 
" Kudos to Indian Cinema","Rather than writing a long review explaining the Pros and Cons this is Indian Cinema which now is evolved.Rather than pleasing the masses they have now gone ahead and showed the truth.The beauty is that even when the audience knows that what has to happen in the end The director still holds us to the movie.It can be said now that filmmakers in India can boldly make real-life stories without fear of controversy or censorship, this may be the best way to approach important stories that must be told. A Must Watch film and good job by Shoojit Sircar.Well Done Team of Madras Cafe." 
" Worth a Watch!!","Madras Cafe is a wonderful representation of Sri Lankan civil war from the viewpoint of India. Critics state that it fails to capture the emotional aspect of the war but it was never meant to be viewed from the Lankan point of view.It is a non Bollywoodish movie where we find no songs, dancing etc. There is no stupid romantic crap in the movie which other Indian political movies show. Relationship of John and Nargis is strictly professional(the way it should be).One of the best Indian movies of the year after probably D Day and Ranjhaana. WATCH IT PEOPLE!!!" 
" Choose Madras over Chennai. It is Crisp, Clean and Clear.","There is absolutely no reason why you should not watch this movie. It is by all means a pretty decent thriller. Utterly devoid of the superfluities and terse to the point of being of labelled as "un-bollywoodish" the movie represents all that is desirable in an entertainer. My brother quite ably put it into words when he declared that the charm of the movie lay in it's abstinence from over indulgence. John Abraham does a commendable job (except for , may be a few scenes, where it is his bad make up and hair do which need to be blamed more than him) .He is supported by an able cast of actors who deliver credible performances. The script isn't circumlocutory and the Director isn't shy of laying down facts and opinions in an unequivocal and objective manner. The absence of songs , does wonders for the health of the audience and the movie too. Needless to say there is no parallel romantic plot disturbing the flow of the narrative. In fact the movie checks itself every time there a temptation beckoning it over do things. The Director is honest and doesn't mince his words when describing the situation as as he sees it.If you have stepped out for a movie and are thinking about catching the last express to chennai , believe me , you ought to change your itinerary and catch a cup of coffee in the café." 
" UKAsian Review: Madras Cafe. A Complex Conflict reduced to a Cops 'N Robbers Shoot 'Em Up!","The events leading up to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, India's ex-PM whilst he was campaigning for re-election in Sriperumbudur District, near Chennai in south India on 21 May 1991 by 'Dhanu', a female suicide 'Tamil Tiger', is the subject of this latest attempt at gritty political Bollywood cinema.Told largely in flashback, we follow Indian army officer Major Vikram Singh (John Abraham) who is appointed by the Research and Analysis Wing ('RAW'), the Indian equivalent of the CIA, to conduct covert operations in the then on-going civil war in Sri Lanka in the late 1980s.Patriotic Vikram ('My country's security is my responsibility!') leaves his teary but dutiful 'army' wife Ruby (Rashi Khanna, in her debut) and travels by boat from south India to the war-torn 'island of jewels'.En-route, he encounters a no-nonsense (she smokes!) British journalist, Jaya (Nargis Fakhri, last seen in 'Rockstar'), who speaks with an inexplicable American twang.Both are on the search for Anna (Ajay Bhaskaran) the leader of LFT which is clearly modelled on the real Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ('Tamil Tigers') who are fighting for a separate Tamil 'Eelam' ('homeland') for the Tamil minority away from the rest of the largely Sinhalese majority.Vikram wants to eliminate Anna; Jaya simply wants a scoop! A plot to assassinate the ex-Indian PM is discovered ('decoded') but will Vikram be able to save the day and more importantly, did 'RAW' and the then Indian government do enough to prevent their ex-PM being blown to bits? With the exception of some pre-credit titles explaining about the then on-going civil war in Sri Lanka, the film is not interested in any meaningful attempt at a socio-historical-political explanation of the bloody civil war which had been brewing since the 1950s and, up to the cease fire in the early 2000s, claimed hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.Instead director Shoojit 'Vicky Donor' Sircar is intent on making an unapologetic, almost propaganda piece with the clear intent of absolving the Indian authorities of any mismanagement in the build up to and the prevention of the assassination. This has been a contentious issue in India: a 1992 Commission Report concluded that security arrangements for Rajiv were adequate but blamed local Congress leaders for disrupting and breaching these arrangements.No subsequent action was taken of the Report's recommendations but it looks like Sircar and his lead man (the film is co-produced by Abraham and there is an unconfirmed rumour it is funded by Sonia Gandhi!) have taken it upon themselves to dispute this finding. This cinematic liberty could be forgiven if the film itself was not so shallow with the complex conflict reduced to a straight 'cops n robbers shoot-em-up'. Sircar is clearly influenced by 'Apocalypse Now' with its iconic helicopters against the sun shot reproduced at one point.Characterisation is also dosa-thin with Abraham's damaged victim persona conveyed via a bearded unshaven look. With the exception of the aforementioned 'Dhanu' (who did a lot!), the women have little to do. Sircar incorporates an unnecessary and clumsy 'kiss n sex' scene.Some dialogue ('this is going to be a long war!, 'the first causalities are always innocent civilians', 'this conversation never happened!', 'You cannot give up on the system!', and my favourite: 'He got honey trapped!"), often repeated, is cringe worthy.The film ends with Abraham reciting a famous Rabindranath Tagore poem ('When the mind knows no fear') but by this time you probably will not care.If you are looking for Indian films which address, inter alia, events leading up to this sad event, it's probably worth seeking out Santosh Sivan's sensitive Tamil film 'The Terrorist' (1998), Mani Ratnam's moving Tamil hit 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' (2002) and even the Malayalam Mammooty potboiler 'Mission 90 Days' (2007).It's welcome that Bollywood is experimenting with new bold controversial subjects like this.It's a pity then that it gets it so wrong again.Even so, its fundamental flaws can even be forgiven (especially as there are no songs or 'item' numbers!). So, if you are interested in this aspect of history retold Bollywood simplistic-style, it may just be worth popping into this Madras Café." 
" 'Madras Cafe' Racially and Politically Motivated","'Madras Cafe,' while viewed as a political thriller with special effects and the whole 'bells and whistles,' is nothing more than a racially and politically motivated movie. The film takes place in Sri Lanka during the 1980's when India got involved in the ethnic conflict between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL).It is about an Indian agent from the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of the Indian intelligence along with Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF). During their tenure between 1987 to 1989, according to Amnesty International, "the IPKF along with the GOSL have been engaged in gross human rights violations against the Tamil population of Northeast Sri Lanka, otherwise known as Tamil Eelam." Why this movie is racially motivated is, because all the bad guys in the film are Tamil. But, not only, that, the LTTE, which is of course proscribed as a 'terrorist' organization in India and in several countries, is misrepresented. Basically, the truth of the history has been twisted, leave alone incorrect. The producer of the film stated that he spent 7 years studying the conflict, but failed on several accounts, that the Tamil Liberation group prohibits drinking and smoking. Even their salute is incorrect in the film.The film further portrays the Tamil rebel leader as a power hungry and incompetent person. Furthermore, it portrays the Government of Sri Lanka, and India as the heroes of the movie. This is no different than making a movie praising the Gestapo of Adolf Hitler in his fight against 'Jewish terrorism' in Germany! Further, all the characters are non-Tamil, while it does not surprise me that the film was screened in US, Canada, and UK in separate theaters with one for Tamil and one for Hindi. This film also is causing a division, not only between North and South India, but between Tamils and Malayalees of the Southern Indian state of Kerala for the fact that all the heroes from India are Keralites, while the bad guys are Tamil. But, even worse, the Malayalee characters are played by actors and actresses of Northern Indian origins not resembling those from Kerala.Now, why is this movie politically motivated? The answer is clear. Sri Lanka has been condemned by International organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Right Watch for its war crimes and crimes against humanity during and after it's final stages of their battle in Northern Sri Lanka. Numerous videos and footage of rapes, torture, and extra-judicial killings have submerged exposing the Genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Also, the upcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka and the possibility of an International Investigation of War Crimes committed in Sri Lanka. Another reason for this film to be released is to give more points to the Indian National Congress to win again in 2014. There is no doubt, that both the Sri Lankan Government and the Congress Party of India has financed this film. Furthermore, that through an independent international investigation into war crimes committed in Sri Lanka, India's name will come out specifically from the Congress Party of India, and Indian representatives in the UN.'Madras Cafe' puts the Tamil people in a bad light, and not doubt, restaurant owners in Western countries that go under the name 'Madras Cafe.' Madras in fact was the former name of Chennai, which is the capitol of Tamil Nadu state of South India. No Tamils will support this film with the exception of a few for monetary gain. Other films banned were those such as 'Vishwapooram' and a YouTube movie mocking the prophet Muhammad. This film not only misrepresents history, but it also black lists a particular ethnic group for a political purpose.On an end note, whether good or bad from either side, the truth should not be taken out of the film. If it is a historical film, it should be made as such. One such historical film from the region I would say is fair and balanced would be that of Ben Kingsley's 'Gandhi.' If the producer of this film wanted to show atrocities, he should have shown it as it was historically, including that from India and Sri Lankan forces. As for 'Madras Cafe,' it is far from the truth..."

" Best movie of the year: Well almost","Madras Cafe: A realistic take on the life of spies and RAW agents. Its not really as stylish and bed of roses as depicted by Bond et al. And they don't always win. And it must be scary to know that one wrong movie on your part, the country's defense can be compromised. Madras Cafe is a tale of the Tamil surge in SriLanka, rise of LTTE and the subsequent side effects ending in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Its a docudrama, showing most true incidents that happened behind one of India's most tragic events. A taut script, fantastic BG score and wonderful direction makes Madras Cafe nearly the best movie of the year. And after somewhile I really enjoyed a John Abraham performance. More than anything, hats off to John for producing this movie. All Kashyaps, Motwanes watch out, cause Shoojit Sircar really knows how to make serious topics in mainstream. And his Journo background must have held him in good stead while making this.My entry into the Oscars this year.9/10" 
" Objective portrayal of LTTE struggle","The political opponents of this film have been proved wrong. Politicians and their sidekicks should first watch the movie before they start screaming "ban, ban"! The film manages to take a cleverly done objective stance of the LTTE fight for Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka and the circumstances that led to the killing of former India PM Rajiv Gandhi. The film could have a better impact if it used names of the real people they trying to portray instead of resorting to semantics to camouflage their identities, while at the same time making it so obvious as to who the characters represent. However, overall it is a thriller which works well unlike Kamaal Haasan's "Vishwaroopam" released few months ago, with a similar theme." 
" "Rajiv Gandhi Dhaba" trying to pass itself off as "Madras Cafe"","Let's get one thing out of the way before I delve into that half baked dish called "Madras Cafe" ; its a commendable effort coming from mainstream Bollywood that needs to watched and encouraged and yadda yadda yadda.......Now this is where Bollywood goes and shoots itself in the foot. They set out with this grand and lofty ambition of making a different kind of a movie, not a 3 hour mindless song, dance and dishum dishum spectacle, a political thriller no less, and yet predictably end up with egg all over their face . Entirely because they neither have the required competency in story telling nor in story enacting, the two vital components which Hollywood has mastered when it comes to war movies/political thrillers (think Argo, Platoon, Z, The Manchurian Candidate etc).Shoojit Sircar's "Madras Cafe" is a stupidly simplistic, glossing over the facts, adolescent comic book take on the vexed, complicated, multi layered, half a century old Tamil – Sinhala strife in SriLanka. Oh did I say Tamil – Sinhala strife? I am so sorry; the move couldn't care less about that at all. What the movie cares about is how the civil war was actually fought between the good guys - RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) of India vs the bad guys - LTTE (rechristened as Tamil Liberation Front, TLF, in the movie) of SriLanka in which "innocents" like Rajiv Gandhi were simply collateral damage. This is where the script writers Shubhendu Bhattacharya & Somnath Dey must take all the flak. Their joint venture script is so amateurish, so full of loop holes and loose ends that it almost reads like a dumbed down Facebook status update that a school going teenager might put up on the Srilankan civil war.Cinematographer, Kamaljeet Negi, appears to be under strict instructions to give the war scenes of the film close resemblance to those of "Apocalypse Now", "Platoon" and "The Thin Red line". Add to it, the unimaginative direction of Sircar (he falls back upon the background voice over narrative ever so often for the sake of us imbecilic audiences ) whereby he thinks he is being clever but ends being too convoluted for his own good. However, clearly the worst part of the movie is rank bad acting all around with lead actor John Abraham taking the cake. Abraham is so flat, monotonous and stiff that even when he hugs his wife passionately you think a mannequin could have done it better. Siddharth Basu, as the RAW chief acts like he is still the quizmaster shooting questions at the hapless contestants. If I have to admit that the undisputed Queen of bad acting, Nargis Fakhri, is the most outstanding act of this movie you get the extent of poor histrionics this movie has to offer. "Madras Cafe" is an intellectually vapid and dishonest film masquerading as a political thriller while it would have easily passed off as a pro Rajiv Gandhi propaganda film made by the Congress party in an election year."
