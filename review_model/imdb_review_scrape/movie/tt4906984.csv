" movie is on the life of Azhar","Now Bollywood made a movie with the mixture of sport and drama. Before seen the movie i read writer got inspired from the Azhar's life so this will be the good movie. But its not like that, the movie is quite simple and the dialogue delivery is not that level. Now a days the standard of Bollywood is so high . Emran Hashmi act Azhar role and he has done great job. In the movie writer tried to show how India board committee slaps a life ban on Azhar. This movie tells the story of Azhar how much he suffered. As i told story is quite simple but writer shown to the society about the Azhar.At least now people knows about Azhar. Media is the great medium to give the knowledge to society. I want to thanks writer,producer who told the story of Azhar by movie." 
" Poor Filmmaking spoils the fun","Finally up for my first review. Just watched Azhar. I have to say it is a rather disappointing movie. This movie is mainly spoiled by the director and the research team. One of the unintelligent moments of the movie were in the first half, he is said to be living in Hyderabad and has to go to Mumbai for a match, basically it's a long train journey and he is shown to leave in his whites(Tes cricket Uniform). It has a lot of stupid moments. Lack of character development. Lack of story development. Good performance by emraan, good job done by prachi desai, horrible job by nargis fakhri. The makers had a strong content which they have done a terrific job to spoil. 4/10." 
" Nice propaganda movie:","Nice propaganda movieNice and clever propaganda. The movie beautifully covers up the issue whether Azhar took money or not, they raised it just before the interval and conveniently covered it under many other aspects of his life. He has played for India and won many matches for the country so of course there will be many things to cherish and celebrate about him, which makes the movie interesting, no doubt. But the whole plot about the match fixing angle is so cooked up, they show him taking money from bookie, talking to the bookie on cellphone during the match and suddenly his conscience awakens up in the middle of the match. How convenient !! And look at the crookedness of the makers, before the start they announce that this is a work of fiction and at the end, Azhar's character tells us I leave it to you, whether you want me to believe or not. Yeah, we are stupid enough to believe, that you took the money but suddenly in the middle of the match, your grandfather's soul made you do the right thing.The whole court case which tries to exonerate him in the movie, was in reality, about the ban on him by the cricket association and and not the actual match fixing, many cine-goers will not be able to realize this difference. This case was dragged for many years and was a low profile one, contrary to what is shown in the movie. Moreover, he is shown as a loving husband and family-man, who protects both his wives and families by not letting them come to court. So much so for a guy who even after marrying twice, had affair with Jwala Gutta and then had another affair with Shannon Marie. Someone has correctly said that some people want to change the definition of our heroes. Thank you Ekta Kapoor, till now you were making garbage movies, now you are making movies on garbage people. I wonder why Emraan accepted this role, probably because it was a tough role, tough to portray a wrong man as right and he must be given credit for his performance, he actually acted good, same goes for Prachi. Nargis and Kunal Roy Kapoor made caricatures of their characters as usual. However biggest achievement goes to the script writers for camouflaging this dishonorable man as a true sportsperson and patriot cricketer." 
" One of the most confusing films ever!","First of all I must commend Emraan Hashmi for a pretty solid performance (Prachi Desai was also good). He clearly seems to have worked immensely hard to do the role and not only adopt the way Azharuddin used to walk, talk etc., but also his cricket shots, batting stance and style. This is really a tremendous level of professionalism, but......... The film somehow seemed very fake. The cricketers, the commentators, the courtroom drama, it all looked to be as if people were out there putting together a theatre show or something - worst of all being his own lawyer!Above all, I can't remember a film that contradicts itself so much and almost drifts away from the details related to earlier. I mean, if Azhar indeed took only to prevent the bookie from bribing others, then why did he take decisions in the game that translated into the opposition piling up a huge total? On the other hand, they also showed that Azhar had a change of mind which came into complete manifestation after the drop catch and the change of bat! So how does the pre-planning of something go hand in hand with the change of heart during the match? With this point, I don't feel the need to address any other flaw or problems. Baffling to say the least! I was like "Erm, what?!" after watching it. I wonder whether this really is the justification that Azharuddin gives for his deed?!The trailer was good, promised a lot, but hugely disappointed. Some real non-serious stuff, this." 
" However you judge him, don't miss the movie","The movie is not without its flaws though. The attention to detail is quite poor and product placements are too blatant.But don't let that hold you back. The movie has all the elements of good, clean entertainment. Romance, humor, drama and some urgency make the movie a tight two hours that you won't be bored of.I don't know whether he did it or not. The movie doesn't argue one way or the other. What it argues is legality of BCCI's verdict. Azhar was the scapegoat of a scandal that had involvement of many on the field and off the field.Judge him however you want, don't miss the movie~ MovieRecipe" 
" Comedy or Propaganda?","Azhar the Movie, like Azhar the Kaalpanik/ Fictional Character mentioned in a disclaimer (at the beginning of the movie) - both of them lack spine.This movie is a sad attempt to justify a character who was poor as a husband, as a person and as a father. Quite frankly, and as several of the other reviews on IMDb are mentioning, this is a clear case of propaganda that the actual Azhar is trying to indulge in.The famous match fixing scandal of the 90s dragged in some big players, both in SA and in India. The legal cases against them were substantiated, and these individuals were subsequently banned from the game for varying periods of time. Are we questioning the calibre of the courts when we try to show these folks, several years later, as upright? Seems kind of 'easy to portray, but difficult to believe'.Azhar was first and always a cheat. In the game, in his marriage, in his relationships with his children (the famous affair with Jwala Gutta, who was his son's friend), and otherwise. Following the debacle in cricket, he went where most goons go - to politics. No guesses into the affiliation he sought and achieved.Now coming to the movie. The acting is unconvincing. The plot is poor. Great actors wasted. Dialogues are juvenile, at the best. Melodrama misplaced. The characters are shallow. The direction a guffaw.As a final statement, I'd like to say that there was no research. This is just the case of a cheat who is trying to show the world he was victimized, when it was actually the reverse. The scenes seem purported from La La Land.1 star out of 10 is what this deserves." 
" Irritatingly Yours","I had decent hopes from this movie. But they were dashed . With bad acting and a very mediocre screenplay , Azhar is to a certain extent intolerable . Lara Dutta and Kunal Roy Kapoor lucidly ruin the film with astonishingly lousy acting. Lara Dutta couldn't have done better , given her skills, while KRK was given one of the most irritating characters to play in the history of stereotypical caricature cinema. The director tries to play with non-linear storytelling in the form of flashbacks and what not , but that does't succeed in hiding the mundane . Emran Hashmi who has acted well in the past as a beleaguered anti-hero , somehow does not seem convincing enough. In an attempt to emulate Azhar's demeanour he sacrifices the necessary cinematic elements of diction and intonation. The movie could have been so much better given the real life events it tries to portray . Alas, it is not so.I only have 3 points for it for now. If perception is relative I may augment the rating in the future ." 
" A fascinating character but a dispassionate film","Azhar lacks spine. It is evident in the long disclaimer preceding the film in which the team seems to be making a claim on cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin's colourful and controversial life as a source material yet maintaining that it is a fictional account. All to escape the legal battles the film could land them in.Azharuddin (Emraan) is a fascinating character to have built a dispassionate film on. A man, who rose meteorically because of his game, the way he let his bat do all the talking on the field. He fell from favour just as fast because of his covetousness and his alleged involvement in the match-fixing scandal that rocked cricket. He is a man of frailties and shortcomings both on the field of cricket and in the arena of love. But instead of exploring the many shades of grey in him, Tony D'Souza attempts to defend and validate him. Such is the bias that the other players — Manoj, Ravi, Navjot (only first names, no surnames mind you) — get the wrong end of the stick.Manoj is made to come across not just as jealous and vengeful but selfish, playing for himself than the country and crude and unrefined to boot. Ravi is nothing but a rake. As though that wasn't enough you have Kapil tell Azhar It's the good-for-nothing kids who trouble the class monitor the most. Poor Azhar! Such is the eagerness to justify him that D'Souza makes it seem as though the whole bad world is out to get him. From his haughty fan-turned-prosecutor Mira (Lara Dutta) to the condescending owner of the gym that he inaugurates. Why he took the Rs. 2 crore from bookie M.K. Sharma and what he did with the money is portrayed in such a way as to earn him some desperate brownie points. Even his walking away from an ostensibly fine marriage into the arms of actress Sangeeta Bijlani (Nargis) is turned into a soppy inevitability with him righteously mouthing lines like A broken relationships doesn't actually mean an end of it. But what of Naureen (Prachi), the one who was wronged? When it comes to the craft, the film looks too outmoded in the way it has been mounted — the loud background score soaring over everything else and dialoguebaazi in the name of conversations.The lines, some of them utterly inane and vacuous, reminded me of heavy duty dialogues of Once Upon A Time In Mumbai. In that masala flick they seemed entertaining, here desperately out of place.Azharuddin's love for his grandfather becomes a way to draw out melodrama; he gets selected in the national team just as granddad breathed his last. And then there is Azhar's father's obsession with his underwear: the mandatory crass comedy track.In the name of acting you have Emraan being stiff, staring deep into the camera, looking far from his comfortable self. Prachi and Nargis weep buckets when they are not being coy. Nargis does it most inelegantly. If that wasn't all there is also Kunaal Roy Kapur as Azhar's lawyer. As yet another stereotype of the South Indian in Bollywood, he irritates to the hilt. So does the film." 
" Emraan is back with his absolute amazing talent","I am making it short and simple. Emraan just nailed it and other actors did their best too but Narghis Fakhri wasn't that good with her part. Story and narration is in the best way as possible so folks no way you should miss this movie.Music is awesome but if you talk about playground then yes i admit it looks bit dull. Supporting crew are brilliant. Prachi has also done a good job and she looks cute all the time.If you are a cricket fan then this movie wont disappoint you. Judge him love him or hate him you are going to love it.Over all 9 out of 10" 
" Whether you're a cricket fan or not, Emraan Hashmi's performance keeps you glued","Everyone loves a sporting hero – the guy who comes from nowhere and wins hearts of the nation. It doesn't happen too often. What happens even lesser is when the very fans who put him on the pedestal, pull him down because they find him unworthy of the love and adulation. Azhar is the story of a fallen hero's fight for his lost dignity. From a lower middle-class background in Hyderabad, Mohammed Azharuddin (Emraan) rises to become one of India's most successful captains in the world of cricket. But the journey is speckled with controversies and scandals galore. On the personal front, he makes headlines when he romances a film heroine Sangeeta (Nargis) who he eventually marries after leaving his first wife Naureen (Prachi). On the career front, he is banned from playing cricket after being accused of match fixing. The film tracks Azhar's journey as he combats his inner battles with a clear mission – to have his name cleared. What's good: There are two ways to make a biopic – you either position it like a docu-drama or take the populist route. Director Tony D'Souza opts for the latter, which is a clever move because Mohammed Azharuddin was always a people's hero. For the most part of the film, the reconstruction of Azhar's life from real to reel is authentic. Tony begins his lead character's story on the right note – his entry on the cricket field on the day of his grandfather's death to Ravi Shastri's role in his selection. The film sails along seamlessly in the first half with the endearing portions between Azhar and Naureen being the highlights. The real Azharuddin has endorsed the film and it's commendable that he gave his nod to the portrayal of all the Grey areas in his life – his infidelity, insensitivity, betrayal, insult, and humiliation is there for public consumption. The most important part is the admission of accepting money from a bookie – even if for a larger reason. Tony has added some delicious moments in the film – look out for the fight with Manoj (Prabhakar) in the locker room; Ravi's (Shastri) wife barging into the spa looking for her philandering husband; Navjyot (Sidhu) refusing to support Azhar and even Kapil (Dev) looking the other way. Azharuddin, as we know him, was always a shy, awkward guy who didn't speak eloquently or display emotions openly. Emraan Hashmi gets the character perfect to the core – from the body language to the attitude. It's a credit to Emraan that you feel the pain of Azhar going from the most loved man to the most hated man in the country. There is a scene where Azhar is called for a ribbon cutting – Emraan's act in that will make you cringe. The conflict that Azhar feels before dating Sangeeta, whether real or aimed at whitewashing, is interesting and effective. As is Azhar's insistence of keeping his wives, parents and kids out of the court, despite being abandoned by his friends and colleagues. There is something uniquely real about Naureen's character from her appearance to her dialogues. Prachi brings to life the dignity and charm of Azhar's former wife with her performance. The non-linear format of the film accentuates the impact. Rajat Arora's dialogues add the necessary chutzpah to Azhar's character.What's not: A major part of the film is in the confines of a courtroom. Sadly, that's the portion that seems dreary. Both the lawyers (Lara Dutta and Kunal Roy Kapoor) in the film are like caricatures. You also wish the film had dug deeper into the story. It feels incomplete; questions still remain unanswered. Nargis Fakhri looks glamorous despite her distracting duck pout but she should strictly avoid roles where she has to emote even remotely." 
" another best performance by actor",""As the tag line of the movie suggest, love him, hate him, judge him, however, if you look at the movie it simply gives the signal that the director only loves Emraan. Well, no one can judge anyone, yet the way the film is made is not par with the expectation of anyone who knows Azhar very well apart from knowing the makers of the movie." "In Jannat (2008), Hashmi played a match fixer and bookie, a role that perfectly suited his louche charm. Azhar sees him at the other end of the transaction, and Hashmi works hard to ensure his own rehabilitation as an actor." "Azhar could honestly have been a great biopic, even within its own self-imposed limitations. Instead, like Azharuddin, it chooses to ignore its own potential and thereby shoots itself in the foot."" 
" Truly Disappointing","Azhar Movie is biopic on Mohammad Azharuddin. He was involved in Match Fixing scandal. So when I started watching the movie I was expecting it would tell me how he took such bad decision but instead movie kept showing him as victim. Story could have shown why Hansie Cronje took Azhar name during controversy.There were lot of Grey areas which were not answered. Biopics are meant to reveal something but Movie just showed events which everyone knew.I expected movie to show how he became cricketer. Show us how he used to practice but there were hardly any scene about that. Imran Hashmi did good job as far as looking like Azhar. Acting was not bad too.This Movie had lot of potential but it falls flat on face." 
" Certainly a 1 time for many reasons, after long time a good Film from Balaji","AZHAR REVIEW :- One of the most awaited film of Emran Hashmi's career from its trailer release to today. When i saw the Trailer of Azhar that time only, i decided to watch this film on First Day First Show. Reasons are known, Emran was looking promising after a long period plus i was interested in knowing our Cricketer Azharuddin's controversial life. Finally watched the Film and i am completely satisfied with this product, it completed all my expectations which were not high. Acting- Excellent job by Emran Hashmi. I haven't seen his some acting oriented movies so i cant decide but still i say it is his Best Performance i've ever seen. His walking Style, Batting style, Dialogue delivery everything was perfect. Not award winning though, but still Kudos for him. Prachi Desai, Nargis Fakhri and Lara Dutta failed to match Emran. They didn't have much screen space, may be that was the reason but really their Make up talks louder than their Acting. Other star cast was strictly okay. Music :- Certainly, not up to the mark. Songs just come and go. Nothing to remember. Same with Background Music. Cinematography :- Worse. Really some scenes looks like daily soaps, especially Cricket match scenes. Disappointing field for the film. Screenplay :- Good but not great. Good because of 130 minutes run time, and not great because editing could have been better. Many scenes and especially songs deserves cut. 2-3 loo breaks are there but still Film doesn't make you feel bore. Dialogues :- Superb ! Clap worthy, whistle worthy and touching. I don't want to spoil much cause it will affect the impact of those dialogues. Direction :- First of all i want to praise Tony D'Souza for daring to make controversial film like this and want to thank him for revealing some truths about Azharuddin. Direction is very good, surpassed my expectations. Tony crafted film very well, especially Interval and Climax scene.Final Words :- Overall a good movie which deserved your one time watch for many reasons. We love you 'Fighter Azharuddin' forever. Thanks to Balaji Production for making this film so that we realise some unknown facts about our Azhar. Go for it, and don't watch it as a movie watch it as Azhar's real life story, movies like this comes very rarely. 7/10 stars by me." 
" A Decent Watch!","Before Emraan Hashmi begins to portray Azhar, A Disclaimer shows up, saying: The following film is NOT a Biopic on the sport legend, but a rather adaptation on the much-talked personality. So, 'Azhar' is not a biopic, even though it covers almost all highlights of Azhar.What works, despite that rather underwhelming disclaimer, is the fairly engaging narrative, held nicely by Director Tony D'Souza & Lead-Actor Emraan Hashmi, who bring merit & some sincerity in the goings-on. Though far from perfect, 'Azhar' is a decently made film, that certainly isn't anywhere close to being bad.'Azhar' is Based on the life of Indian cricketer and former national team captain Mohammad Azharuddin. Right from his triumphant success, to his controversial professional & personal life. 'Azhar' is interesting in parts. Watching Azhar romance between his two wives, as well as take on captaincy in the Indian Team, offer some genuinely arresting sequences. His triumph does leave a mark. However, when Azhar is dragged to court for "match-fixing", the courtroom sequences that follow, are plain ordinary. The courtroom sequences lack fire. Had these sequences been better, 'Azhar' would've been a far superior adaptation.Rajat Aroraa's Screenplay is quite decent, but why is the drama in the courtroom so lazily written? The Writing needed to be stronger, no two options on that! Even the dialogue, range from massy to entirely ridiculous. Tony D'Souza's Direction is well-done. He has handled the film competently. Cinematography is good. Editing is mostly crisp, but the second-hour could've been sharper. Music by Various Artists, is excellent. Background Score merits a special mention.Performance-Wise: Emraan Hashmi as Mohammad Azharuddin/Azhar, is at his most sincere. The actor is in form, delivering a credible performance as the legendary sportsman. This is among Hashmi's better works, without doubt! Prachi Desai as Naureen, the first wife of Azharuddin, is excellent. Nargis Fakhri as yesteryear actress Sangeeta Bijlani, the second wife of Azharuddin, looks hot as ever, but falls flat acting wise. Lara Dutta as Meera, who fights against Azhar in court, is strictly okay. Kunaal Roy Kapur as Reddy, who defends Azhar, adapts a south Indian accent so fake, that he turns him into a caricature. Rajesh Sharma as M.K. Sharma, a slimy match fixer, is top-notch, as always. Others lend fair support.On the whole, 'Azhar' isn't power packed, but its certainly watchable & also well-done in parts." 
" "Azhar" is a golden opportunity gone wasted","Biopics are gaining popularity in Indian Cinema as it tells the true incident of a person or event portrayed on the silver screen. With Dirty Picture, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Manjhi-The Mountain Man following the trend, it is thoroughly inspiring and motivating. Will "Azhar" lives up to the reputation and gives you hard-hitting drama with realistic views on life ? Well, let us check it out"Azhar" tells the untold story of legendary cricket Mohammaed Azharuddin (played by Emraan Hashmi) who was center of controversy due to one incident which changed his life.It takes nerve of steel to make biography of a famous personality who took 16 years of his life to fight for justice. First time film maker Tony D Souza does gives a sincere attempt but it too far from making any impact. The film talks about the cricket which is considered as the most famous game in India but matches shown in the film lacks the excitement. Tony D Souza only shows the brighter side of legendary cricketer but when a biography is being made, true introspection of a person's life should be depicted which include the grey areas as well. This is clearly missing in the film. The content of the film and even the characters have not been defined. The real-life drama has been tweaked into reel world with extra spices. The screenplay in the first half is pretty smooth but falls down in the later half. Art direction is good. Cinematography is excellent. Music is tuneful. Dialogues are too corny.Being fan of Azharuddin, I was expecting Emraan Hashmi to deep-dive into the character. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The actor tries hard but falls flat on the face. Still his performance is sincere compared to his previous films. Other actors like Lara Dutta and Kunal Roy Kapur gives a good performance. Prachi Desai does well in small role while Nargis Fakhri disappoints.Overall, "Azhar" is a golden opportunity gone wasted." 
" Goof up between fact and fiction","Makers were completely confused about their point of view while making this film so as I was confused to decide my side. Only, one page disclaimer of film is in detail which says that it doesn't claim to be real other wise all scenes are very hurried. Makers assumed that every one is well versed with the personal and professional happenings in Azhar life. Flashback type of narration is boring. Cricket scenes are not interesting. Dialogues by writer of film Rajat Arora, are OK but most of the time go over board like in beginning of film, Azhar voice over comes that as an Indian Cricket Team captain, public used to of treating him like Damad, what is it!!!? Wouldn't it be better if he said like Beta. Writer had to be aware that it is not "Once Upon A Time In Mumbai". If actor is unable to carry emotional scene then director shakes the camera like in the scene where Azhar gets news of his maternal grand father demise. Court room scenes are also more about heavy dialogues rather then witty and intelligent facts. In serious court scene they insert comedy which comes prominently eventually drastically reducing the required impact of scene. Casting is ridiculous. Not a single actor convinces about the real name, he was portraying including female one. Emraan Hashmi as Azhar is OK. Prachi Desai as his wife looks pretty and emotes well especially in the scene when she gets information about another girl in her husband life through his indirect confession on T.V. Kunal Roy Kapoor as lawyer Reddy is fantastic. Rest are nothing to be mentioned."
