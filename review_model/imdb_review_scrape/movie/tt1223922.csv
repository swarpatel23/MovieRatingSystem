" Weak and Ineffectual","I had a lot of expectations from this Movie and all it delivered was dissatisfaction and pain. It was a weak plot and very predictable. To add to this, the dialogue delivery and on screen presence was pathetic. Zayed Khan should be looking for some other options as acting is not an area where he can excel. Moreover, Katrina Kaif also looked fake and was not able to do her best. I have seen her performing better in some other movies. Yes, the locations are good, but its the plot and the acting that drags the movie to a new low. With the amount of money spent on this movie, it would have been better to get in some more substance rather than the effects. Sanjay Dutt is not at his best and disappoints as well. The only highlight of this movie is some SKIN show by Lara Dutta but that cannot make up for the bad experience. She has given steamy scenes in a lot of movies but this ain't the best. It would have been better if it was an exact copy of Into The Blue, it was better and the plot was good. Movie is good in parts but fails as a whole package. Maybe it was the expectation and the hype, however, it was a very lame movie with nothing new except the underwater sequence.If you have nothing else to do and want to kill your time, you may go and watch this movie. Not recommended for people who have high expectations." 
" blue.","The only good thing about this movie is it's new for bollywood audience and credit to director nd crew for THEIR hard work on the film. Sympathies aside, Indian audience have watched films like this b.f particularly Hollywood underwater films in recent years. Hollywood movies Jaws and The Deep both based on novels by peter benchley were benchmarks for these kind of films and for audience who loved this genre. Bt recent underwater films by Hollywood and now Blue are no better then the novels themselves, that is to have a story. Blue is a story less film and more about the visuals and the stunts, including wasting the bike stunts all the way in the east that led nowhere. The movie is more or less based on technical aspects of film making than based on a story of any kind. The lady in blue story is pretty good even though it consists of a stupid investigation in accusing the captain of being a traitor. At least Blue could have used this story and made it an historic marine story of sorts, but you end up having the villain(unimpressive akshay) search this treasure to "save the family's honor", while meaning no harm to put the sanjay's family thru all the tamasha.Ther were no twists even for double crossing rahul dev was dumb, b.c he wasn't interested in this movie at all while seeing his reactions. Overall, thers no treasure hunting b.c its only for a few scenes way down the second half and towards the end of the movie. The movie is sentimental and dull in the first half, nd the second half is of no interest by the time the movie ends." 
" Fool","Blue,one of the most anticipated movies of 2009 is a foolish movie.Being told Bollywood's most expensive film the film turns out to be so cheap.Anthony D Souza,the director wasted a terrific opportunity.His direction is average.The music is by A.R Rahman,is surprisingly bad.What makes me give this film 2 stars is mainly for its the stunts and photography.Performance wise-Sanjay Dutt is overweight.Akshay Kumar is okay.Zayed Khan needs a crash course for acting.shows you how to wear the two-piece, and look like a goddess of the sea.Katrina Kaif comes in the very start,leaves off and comes in the climax.Thats it.Rhaul Dev is half baked.Kabir Bedi has no dialogs.Overall Blue is a fool" 
" Blue "Stinks" and sadly "Sinks", still feeling the 'Blue's about it.","Starring :- Sunjay DuttAkshay KumarZayed KhanLara DuttaKylie MinogueDirector :- Anthony D'SouzaRating :- * 1/2Since the past one month or so wherever i go, be it a night club, or a wedding, or just usual hangout spots, i noticed the songs of "Blue" playing over 'n' over. That's called excellent publicity. It would do good to any movie, only if, with a BIG "IF", the movie is good, or at least decent. That is not the case with "Blue".Excellent publicity can't do good for a really BAD and PATHETIC movie. When i first saw the promo of the movie i thought this might not be the most critically acclaimed film of the year but it should be a "Fun to watch popcorn movie". But no, it turns out to be a stinking affair, smellier than Mr Akshay Kumar's socks which he's wearing since his last successful film "Singh is Kinng" although that movie wasn't a good one, but still it was way better than "Blue". First lets just get to the premise of the film. The plot revolves around the trio mainly Sunjay Dutt(Sagar), Akhshay Kumar(Aarav, Sagar's friend) and Zayed Khan(Sam, Sagar's younger brother). Also there is Lara Dutta(Mona, Sagar's better half) and Katrina Kaif(Nikki) and Rahul Dev(Gulshan).Sagar and Aarav are friends, together they go fishing and have an occasional boxing face off. Aarav tries to convince Sagar to go treasure hunting with him, because only Sagar knows the whereabouts of it. But Sagar refuses due to the reason that his father lost his life while searching for that treasure and blames himself for his father's death.The story cuts to Sam, who is in Malaysia doing bike races, he gets a job from Gulshan(Rahul Dev) to deliver a package, but he loses it on the way, now Gulshan wants either his package back or $50 million. Nikki(Katrina, Sam's love interest and also working with Gulshan( advices him to leave Malaysia and go somewhere else, so he goes to Bahamas to his elder brother Sagar, that's where the main story begins.Coming to the main highlight of this film, the underwater sequences, believe me they were that good. Excellent lighting and camera angles and shots makes it look like an international affair. But that's the only thing good about "Blue". The action sequences are passable to say the least. No thrilling action sequence is to be found here. Only lame-money-spending-good-for-nothing kind of action sequences are there. Specifically the bike chase sequence, the one involving some 4-5 bikes and a train was so lame, the bikes which were supposed to be on the chase seems like they are out on a picnic and are grouping together to enjoy the sight-seeing, including the guy on the bike they were supposed to be chasing. If that doesn't make you shake your head in disbelief then the dialogs would definitely do that, for instance Aarav saying "Lets go take out the treasure from the sea", as if he's talking about going for window shopping and that too for a toothbrush. Also there's another one Mona saying "Can't we just talk peacefully with them?", even when she and Sagar are being attacked by armed men. These do work as "Unintentional jokes". And believe me there are many more.Also the plot holes are so big you can virtually make Jupiter pass through it. For instance, the "So-Called" treasure which is lying in the bottom of the ocean is so mysterious that many people even doubt its existence and people who tried to take it out lost there lives, but our protagonist Sagar(Sanjay Dutt), sleepwalks his way through the ocean and finds out the treasure just like "that". Either he is a combination of Columbus and Sherlock Holmes or the director and his team of writers were too busy thinking about the cinematography part that they forgot about the minor details in the story.Talking about the "so called" surprise ending of the film, the only surprise you will get is that you'll notice that most people are actually laughing at what had to be a serious moment in the film, "Unintentional Laughs" arise universally.The second highlight of the movie is Lara Dutta, who is looking like a zillion-gazillion bucks, she rules the waves and many a hearts too. The perfect eye candy.The cinematography is top grade, but under that glossy finish lies a decomposed chunk of wood, that is being eaten by termites and at the end what is left is that glossy finish with a BIG HOLE inside.The music is average, although some notes are easy on the ears, but still considering A.R. Rahman is the music and background score director, the music is disappointing and so is the film.And don't get me started on the script, like Akshay's previous outing "Kambakkht Ishq" the script is "Missing". Although at some points in the movie you feel like there's a decent script developing, but as soon as you think that, the director puts all your doubts aside and comes up with another blow up.With holes that BIG, even the unsinkable Titanic sank, and sadly so does "Blue", but with the sinking it stinks too.I go for * 1/2 out of five for director Anthony D'Souza's "Blue"An opportunity lost, this film made me wonder why am I even reviewing it.Under all that gloss lies a BIG HOLE that takes "Blue" down that smelly drainpipe which hasn't been cleaned since the medieval ages.Watch it only when someone threatens to kill you for not watching it." 
" Stay Far Away!","The protagonists are searching for a treasure ship that was traveling from Britain to India, and was lost at sea in the Bahamas.. yes Bahamas is en route to India! The acting is horrible, the dialogues are especially cheesy and dialogue delivery made me want to throw up. All the actors make a mess, cant actually blame them if the script was this bad. It has scenes lifted from movies like Torque and Hitch, and has an overall feel of Fool's Gold.I liked the setting, and cinematography is quite breathtaking. It has a few decent action sequences, though the editing leaves a lot to be desired. The story is very weak and predictable, go for this one only if you have absolutely nothing else to do." 
" Brainless, forgettable action-thriller","Blue, directed by Anthony D'souza is a brainless, forgettable action-thriller that quickly sinks without a trace. Let me say this right away: anyone expecting anything other than the sight of Lara Dutta in a skimpy bikini, or indeed Akshay Kumar with his shirt off, is going to be very disappointed. The film's hare-brained plot involves a coveted treasure buried at the bottom of the ocean, and a reluctant Sanjay Dutt playing Sagar, a working class, regular-Joe in the Bahamas who refuses to seek it out even though he seems to be the only diver in the world who knows where and how to find it. No amount of coaxing from his friend and employer Aarav (played by Akshay Kumar) will do the trick. But the out-of-shape Dutt – whose unsightly man-boobs suggest he's been bunking too many sessions at the gym – finally agrees to take the plunge when his kid-brother's life depends on it. Sam (played by Zayed Khan wearing a single expression throughout) is in trouble with some goons who must be paid $50 million immediately. For a film that's titled Blue, most of the action here involves bike chases and car explosions, while the underwater portions are gorgeously filmed but evoke no real excitement. To be honest, in fact, the tension never heightens to the point where you worry about the protagonists. How can you, when you notice even the sharks are swimming peacefully around them, oblivious and uninterested even when underwater brawls result in blood being spilt! Blue suffers from a dull script and inane dialogue, and is cursed with characters that are as shallow as the waters they paddle. You want to burst into laughs when Lara Dutta (playing Sagar's girlfriend Mona) slips into Miss India mode and complains that they have no money to realise her one dream of setting up a marine research facility. The lady does not show so much as a passing interest in fish, by the way! Coming back to the business of the buried fortune, let's just say we've all participated in school treasure-hunts that were more challenging than this one. We're told the fortune hasn't been retrieved in 60 years, and yet Sagar leads the way to the loot as if it's lying in his backyard. Neither slick nor fast-paced, this film lumbers in circles before crashing into a moronic finale involving ridiculous back-stories about dead family members. In the end, despite its travel-brochure look that might afford some momentary National Geographic-style relief, Blue doesn't have a shred of intelligence, and it sinks in a sea of lame writing and laughable performances. Sanjay Dutt sleepwalks through his scenes, and Akshay Kumar overdoes the smugness. As for Zayed Khan, how I wish the makers had spent the fee they paid him to hire a few more sharks and include a few more thrills instead. The music by AR Rahman is strictly average; even the item song by Kyle Minogue can't save this film from reaching its watery grave.Director Anthony D'souza's Blue's has flashy exterior and it's one dead fish. Watch it strictly at your own risk." 
" Blue: nothing but eye candy and great visuals..","Just got back from the theatre. I was excited about Blue. There was a big hype around Blue, as it is one of the most expensive Bollywood movies ever made, it has a wonderful star cast,Oscar-winner A.R.Rahman's music, Kylie Minogue, great publicity.I thought Blue would have a rocking story apart from all the bikes, explosions and underwater diving. Of course there is a story, but it just doesn't live up to anyones expectations.Blue has some plusses though, it has been shot very lavishly, I am always afraid of weird looking bollywood action scenes, Blue doesn't have those. Blue has excellent action scenes, first-rate stunts, awesome camera-work (Especially under water!). Go see Blue if you are okay with seeing only great visuals and stunts. The movie is not bad, the story is just bad, everything else is awesome.I rate this movie 7 out of 10 because of the following things : - Akshay Kumars awesome flawless acting as a negative role. - Sanjay Dutts performance. - Zayed Khan for once, doesn't go unnoticed, well done. - Katrina Kaif's hitting cameo. - Aaj dil gustakh hai, Fiqrana and Blue theme. - Superb actions and visuals." 
" What a Disappointment","Another total trash from Akshay Kumar and gang. I wonder why Akshay Kumar wanting stars from other countries trashed into his movies without any relevance? Dog in Sing is king and Kyslie in this movie. Such glorious international name don't add any value to Akshay's movies, which are scripted badly combined with Akshay over acting. Akshay is extremely talented actor, but unable to give a single hit in a while and you see why.The protagonists are searching for a treasure ship that was traveling from Britain to India, and was lost at sea in the Bahamas.. yes Bahamas is en route to India! The acting is horrible, the dialogues are especially cheesy and dialogue delivery made me want to throw up. The young khan is complete waste in this movie. Actually all the actors make a mess, can't actually blame them if the script was this bad. It has scenes lifted from movies like Torque and Hitch, and has an overall feel of Fool's Gold.The setting and cinematography are quite breathtaking. It has a few decent action sequences, though the editing leaves a lot to be desired. The story is very weak and predictable, go for this one only if you have absolutely nothing else to do." 
" Blue fades away","BLUE, awaited movie of the year is a failure. Despite multiple star cast, 100 crores budget, Kylie Minologue the film is total failure. Film lacks story & it doesn't entertain you except A.R. Rahman's music. The only thing I liked about this film is the superb music of A.R. Rahman & Lara dutta. Akshay Kumar is dull & boring with his monotonous acting. Sanjay Dutt looks very simple & hasn't done enough work (his tummy is clearly visible. that looks very bad). Katrina too is being spoilt with the role. The positive thing about the movie is music, some great underwater scene & glimpse of the underwater life. Else it is just waste of 2 hrs & Rs. 200." 
" Worst movie of the year.","Without a shadow of a doubt this is one of the worst film of the year. I never believed it would actually top such title as "Kambakkht Ishq", "Love Aaj Kal" or "Chandni Chowk to China" but it did. The plot and the script is very poorly written with some dialogues being straight lifted from well known movies.I am not going to divulge the plot because it is so simple with one twist in the end. After watching the first 30 minutes you will be able to tell what is going to happen for rest of the movie. But I have to say the cinematography was good, i think that was only good thing about the movie.In conclusion I would like to say the script is poorly written with equally bad plot, its delivered very poorly by the cast with many dialogue and continuity errors which are obvious to the audience during the run of the movie. The only plus point is you get to see Lara Dutta in bikini which she looks wonderful in but not the acting!" 
" More like Ewwwww!","Poo-poo! Yuck. Suck. Agh! I can't even begin to tell you how bad this film was. Completely horrible. Tried to copy the Dhoom movies and Race but failed horribly. The story does not take off until well after 1 full hour and by that time if I was watching it in theatres I would have left a long time along (and requested my money back), the editing was very poor(it looked all senselessly chopped together) and the acting was woeful. It was almost like they were shooting ads for different kinds of products (like look at what the ducati can do, Ducati 999 buy one today! Or Lara's line of bikinis, get yours today etc. etc.) Anthony D'Souza needs to apologise to everybody who saw this film.I have finally figured out what the problem with Lara Dutta is, she is too comfortable in fluffy roles, she does not even try to challenge herself nor does she want to. And as for Kylie Minogue, I can't even begin to tell you how shocked I was to see her like that. I cannot talk too much about her because I know she just went through breast cancer treatment and only God knows what she is going through personally. I just did not expect to see her face all pulled back and botoxed up like Nicole Kidman. Do they think because they live far away down under we wouldn't notice the surgery and injections? The less said about her trying to dance like Beyonce(from her video of 'Upgrade you'), the better.That aside, this movie was so shockingly lackluster, the only good thing about it was the song compositions by AR Rahman and the exotic locales of The Bahamas and Bangkok. Katrina Kaif, should have said no to her cameo(the minute she showed up I figured the stupid plot) but of course she thought the film was going to be a hit that's why she couldn't help herself." 
" a perfect disaster","BlueLike akshay kumar has decided to beat his own record of giving consecutive CRAPS here comes another DISASTER .Story has nothing new to offer , a group of criminals , younger brother trapped between bad guys and for his life elder brother goes for what he had decided not to do. A sexy girlfriend who was on gunpoint of bad guys and finally a fox like friend.If it was not enough an international pop star's cold special appearance .Performance ? yes nobody has performed because director's role was missing . Like akshay kumar has written his own pathetic dialogues . every time he opens his mouth to shoot pathetic dialogues if u see his performance zayed khan has done better than him in the movie. Sanjay dutt , why director had chosen him is a big question.. He was not looking in shape and not at all a deep sea diver . he was looking tired and FAT. Lara dutta had nothing to do accept to do a bikini song. Stunts of B grade Hollywood movie would be better than this .and if one wants to see underwater marine world, he should see discovery channel but not this.Biggest disappointment was from director's side. he has made it without any planning.Total waste of producer's money and people like me who went to see this crap." 
" Thank you D'Souza for the great visuals!","I don't understand all the negativity and bad reviews of the self-proclaimed movie phd's aroundhere.It seems that these criticasters went to the movie to compare it scene by scene with Hollywood ones. Next time these guys see an Indian actor riding on a horse, they will conclude that that particular scene or perhaps the whole movie is a copy of a Hollywood Western.And so what if it is inspired by Hollywood movies? Finally, it's the result that counts. I like this movie because of it's great picturization! And Yes, the story could have been better, but it's not that bad eighter. Nevertheless, I've seen a good composed story and enjoyed with a lot of popcorn. High standards of cinema are achieved, despite the thin storyline. The last motorbike chase is really awesome. It's stunning composition generates a huge adrenaline boost for the viewer. And the underwater scenes where accompanied by such a nice music score. Yas Raj should learn from this movie how to use background music. A.R. Rahman has proved his versatility as music composor: he has produced very beautiful music for this movie. This man is an Artist! And Kiley's performance is super diva! The minor point in the story line is the anticlimax at the end. Akshay as a nice villain who needs to be hugged and his motive to save the family honor, disappoints big time. But thank god they spoiled only these last 5 minutes of the movie. I would rather see a more creative plot with a edge of my seat, mean, dirty, rude and crude result.Despite the lack in content, but due to it's high visuals and powerful action scenes this movie has repetitive value, so I will watch it again. The time for ''Pyaar ke Bokhaar'' (love fever) movies has passed, it's now time for movies like Dhoom, Don and Blue!" 
" Worth a one time watch fun movie Hot lara dutta","Dear Friends Blue is a full time pass movie so leave your critical mind at home and just flow with the fun thrill and comedy involved in the movie. The start of the movie is pretty thrilling with some nicely directed races. The general canvas of the movie is very grand and pleasing to the eye. Kylie Minogue really sizzles and this was the best song (chiggy wiggy)i liked out of the sheer naughtiness and a very catchy tune. The acting by all the actors is merely average and they are not entirely to blame for it as the story only did not allow them to put forth something special. But a special mention of Lara Dutta she just sizzles the screen with her bikinis and carries herself with a lot of sensuality. She is I think one of the most seductive Heroines of the Hindi cinema right now. Also i want to urge all the visitors of IMDb to right comments and at least vote so that our views can help each other. All in all if you have 2 hours i would suggest you go and watch this movie its worth one time watch at least. Regards" 
" Heavily Disappointed","Just watched Blue and sorry to say it did not live up to its hype at least for me.I mean there is nothing bad in breath-taking stunts, falling vehicles and scantily clad dames throughout, but there should at least be a soul of the film which is the story . The soul of the film is missing IMO. And whatever is offered is very much predictable. I mean if you are stunned by the twists in the movie, then you have not seen enough thriller movies. Even the movie Race had shocking twists than Blue. My college friends were all the time busy in predicting what will happen next and most of the times they were right. Good things about the movie was the cinematography and the breathtaking visuals. It is visually a brilliant movie. The BGM was disappointing. Not expected from Rahman Sir. Akshay Kumar and Sanjay Dutt were the saviors of the movie. No one can beat Akshay in such roles. Lara was there just to shed clothes and be the damsel in distress. Katrina Kaif's Special appearance had more impact than Lara's main role. Zayed Khan did the same thing what he had being doing since his debut (Curse that day :(). I did not understand the reason for the Kylie song in the movie, They could have just done a promotional song with her that plays at the end credits. Overall, watch it for it's style, glamor, action - But if you are looking for good story, you will be disappointed.Rating : 5/10" 
" blue has taken bollywood to a completely different level","A must watch film for this diwalli.blue is filled up with some breathe taking stunts which we generally see in Hollywood films.action sequences in the film got some make over from Hollywood films like Italian job. The story line of film is quite predictable and slow.Brilliant performances by akhsay,zayed and lara saves the film,but the role of sanjay dutt didn't suit him.katrina and kylie stunts their role with a cameo.a.r.rahman's music is the backbone of the film.over all film does't disappoint anyone,and after a string of flops to akhsay and zayed blue proves to be a Saviour."
