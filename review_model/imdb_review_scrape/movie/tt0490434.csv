" PAWN TAKES KING","This is my christening into Bollywwod movies, and I am not sure what to think. This film has the English subtitles with British spellings. I noticed some of the film was spoken in English, apparently certain phrases are common like "Hello, thank you, and I love you." What I consider the end credits are shown in the beginning as well as the actual license granted to make this film. Bollywood films are not 90 minutes and in the can, but run long with this one clocking in at 140 minutes. There are also some phrases I didn't understand as when Raja is described as being "chocolate faced." There is clearly a western influence on the films as when Pooja (Misha) gets out of the pool and flings her wet hair back in a seductive manner aka Phoebe Cates, but that is where the similarity ended.The fight scenes were comical as the sound didn't match up very well with the hitting. Someone being grabbed by the shirt has the same sound as someone being punched in the face. There is an abundance of swooshes with most of the moves, including when Kaalia Abdul removes his scarf/shawl. Gun shooting isn't done very well either. Anna is a man's name and the line between elected official and crime don is blurred. Likewise the police are not independent of wealthy citizens.Tiger (Inder Kumar) is dead at the beginning of the film with his brother Raja(Faisal Khan) enacting revenge. While Raja is in jail we get a lengthy flashback of the events leading up to Tiger's death followed by a lengthy feature afterwards. In the midst of all this crime/action/drama there are 5 musical numbers...no kidding. Imagine watching a movie like "Dirty Harry" then having Clint Eastwood break into a lip synced song and dance with 4-5 women. It was that MST good.There are some interesting cultural aspects of the film such as the relationship of family to the community, the need to keep face (apparent Mumbai is one small Peyton Place where everyone knows everyone), the dishonesty in local politics, and the struggle of women to marry whom they choose. In one weird scene a woman marries a man forbidden by her father. The groom holds her father at gun point during the ceremony. Right after the ceremony, the bride asks her father for his blessing. This didn't seem to be intentionally comical, but rather demonstrates the the strong family ties. A marriage can not be successful without the blessing of the parents.There is no sex, nudity, or swearing. Even the kissing is cut short. Belly buttons appear to be the big attraction over cleavage. Our hero manages beat up the bad guys without any special skills.As a serious movie for the average American Joe to watch and enjoy, I say avoid. Interesting way to get a feel for Indian culture and the western influence. Might work with an MST buzz too."
