" Did they take the rights of the Korean thriller 'THE CHASER' or just copied it shamelessly as per the old Bhatt camp's tradition?","With MURDER 2, the decades old tradition of Bhatt Camp continues, taking it all (from the first frame to the last) from an engrossingly well made Korean Thriller called "THE CHASER" released in 2008.In short, the director and his writer take 90% ingredients for their over-cooked script from the Korean Film. Then they add a love-sex angle to it as a mandatory clause of Hindi Film-making technique. To make it more spicier, they bring in some eunuch characters into the narration with the get-up earlier used in their own films, SANGHURSH (by Ashutosh) and SADAK (by Sadashiv). And further, sprinkling it with a few emotional sequences about some broken families, they are ready with their latest flick MURDER 2, taking advantage of the brand name of their earlier Hit MURDER.As I have realised, many of my reader friends here would like to say that, "We don't really care if it's a copy or not, so cut out the allegation crap and just let us know whether the movie is good or bad and that's it."In answer to that I would only like to say that MURDER 2 is an Open Creative Theft made by the Bhatt camp in this current age of world-wide- web. Now, a theft remains a theft, whether done carelessly or with utmost care and devotion. Even if it happens to be a too good movie (which fortunately it isn't), still it remains a Shameless Robbery of any other person's creative work and nothing else. And I am simply not interested in writing a detailed review of a copied movie.However, for all my friendly readers, who are willing to know more about Cinema in details, I would like to present this movie as a fine lesson in learning few important things about Bollywood Film-making style.1. Bollywood film-maker's biggest problem is that we still are not sure of what genre we are dealing in while making a film. The current MURDER 2 copies a fast paced cruel bloody Korean thriller "THE CHASER" which solely talks about a serial killer, murdering all the girls in the flesh trade. He is being tracked by a detective turned pimp whose all girls are disappearing one after another. The film starts and ends just around this one single track and has no-unwanted scenes in between talking about something else. In simple words, it's a Bloody Suspense Thriller and it remains a bloody suspense thriller throughout.But MURDER 2 not even remains a thriller in its more than 2 hours of duration. There is an added track in it of a beautiful model girl who is in love with the hero as Love essentially has to be there like sugar or salt in a dish. There are many unwanted eunuchs and unmoving stories of broken families inserted into it which were not required at all. The soundtrack has surprisingly all love songs in a CRIME THRILLER movie like a variety served on the dinner table by its makers.2. Secondly in this new age of fresh creative minds, we still follow double standards in showing the characters of our male and female leads. Now in the original flick the lead character or the hero is an ex- dirty detective turned Pimp dealing in girl trade, who is searching for his missing girls. But in our Hindi version the hero becomes an ex-Cop turned detective looking for the serial killer as his private assignment. So the writers give a certain amount of respect to their Lead Male character played by Emraan Hashmi in the film.But on the other hand MURDER 2 has a sexy-model character played by Jacqueline Fernandez, who simply has no definite role in the movie but is added only to be exploited as a female body. So the point here is that at one end the makers give a certain kind of respect to their male Hero by changing him from a Pimp to a Cop- Detective. But on the other hand the female lead in the film is only used to show her skin and bring in more initial crowds in the theater as expected from the title of the film. That's the double standard mind-set Bollywood actually works in.3. Thirdly after watching both the movies, you will have a clear idea of what it means by the term "Added Sub Plots" which in most of the cases ruin the real essence of a film. In this case too, where the original keeps walking on a single track and never gets distracted from its basic storyline of A Chaser, its Hindi copy keeps wandering between its various added subplots which could have been easily avoided. Frankly speaking we can't even stick to a basic storyline even when its all copied from another brilliant source.4. Lastly and more importantly, if you even copy the idea for the Poster of your film along with its script then I wonder what the whole team actually may have done as far as creativity is concerned in this project. Here the makers of MURDER 2 not only copy their whole film from the Korean Original scene to scene, but they also copy their posters from a Danish film called "Antichirst" released in 2009 and a Korean film "Bad Guy or Nabbeun Namja" which came in 2001. Now that's really a great amount of research done by the team.Summing up, with MURDER 2, the Bhatt camp continues to try for their next box office success in Hindi Cinema by taking the credit of all the hard work done by someone else residing in a different part of the globe far awayand they have really mastered this shameful act of "Art of Inspiration" by now. (However, I would love to be surprised with the impossible news that they actually did buy the rights this time.)" 
" Dark,Erotic,Thriller,and Intensely Touchy.........","if you are expecting Murder 2 to be Erotic like Murder 1 then you are right but after that it goes beyond your expectations with a Superb storyline,Mind blowing performances and Amazing Music and Background Score.The Storyline is very Innovetive.It shows the Dark side of the Society.The Movie is set in Goa where a serial Killer is on the loose.The Movie keeps you on the Edge of your seat all the time.Some scenes in the movie are disturbing and are not for faint hearted.The cinematography is Excellent and almost every frame of the Movie looks Amazing.Director Mohit Suri have very good Story telling skills and the storyline is gripping with some unpredictable sequences.Emraan Hashmi plays cop to perfection,one of his finest performances.Prashant Narayanan is Dynamic actor giving top notch performance.He is surprise of the movie and you will get to see one of the best villain of all time,really very memorable performance.The chemistry between Emraan and Jacqueline is very good.Murder 2 is one of the finest crime stories ever made.Its a perfect entertainer.On the whole the Movie is Dark,Erotic,Thriller,and Intensely Touchy........." 
" A Million times better than the first part.","Well where to begin, yes the concept is taken from a crappy made Korean movie The Chaser, but the storyline of Murder 2 is much different and aspect and feel of the movie is completely opposite from the chaser. It's dark, gloomy, scary, thrilling, and bone-chilling horror movie. It's been a looong time since I've seen a bollywood movie which kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.Now to give u the sense of what I'm saying, if you have seen the movie SANGHARSH starring Akshay Kummar, Priety Zinta, and Ashutosh Rana, then you can expect something very similar in this movie. Murder 2 had the same feeling of Sangharsh but it's alooot more twisted and scary. My suggestion is to watch this movie alone at night with darkness. Now comparing this to the First Murder: First off THANK GOD this was not a sequel from the first movie, because that storyline was ridiculous and stupid. This part was totally different.You can easily see how far of a better actor Emraan Hashmi has become from his younger days. He did an excellent job playing his role, never once he disappointed. Now onto Jacqueline Fernandez - Holy Smokes I had no idea she was this hot, I mean I've seen her in other small roles and item songs, but I was blowned away to see her amazing acting skills.Now onto Prashant Narayanan - I saw this guy first in the movie Yeh Saali Zindagi. I really don't know who discovered him, but THANK YOU for giving him a break in movies. He's just a natural, his voice, his eyes, his personality is perfect for these kinds of roles. If you watch him in his recent movie Bhendi Baazar you'll see that he was born to do roles like this. I'm astonished to see how polished of an actor he is. Bollywood is lacking villains lately but looks like they have found the perfect one. I really really want to see him more in movies. WOW!!!Overall: Compare to the trash bollywood movies that have been coming out lately, Thank God for this movie to arrive at the right time. I was not expecting much but it totally blew my socks away.Well Done Bhatt Camp, Mohit Suri did yet another fantastic job on directing this movie. He has a really unique gloomy vision which really catches your attention." 
" The Chaser - in Goa","First of all, do not read any reviews on multiple Indian sites such as rediff and dna. I have a strong reason for the same. Raja Sen of Rediff, claims "The Chaser" to be a little obscure film, he didn't care to look for. Mayank Tiwari claims Korean cinema to be exploitative in nature. So, U can see how the reviewers in India have become slaves to mushy gay flicks belonging to Karan Johar's Gang. Moving on, this is a good rip-off. Mohit Suri earlier ripped off A Bittersweet Life in Awarapan, and now this. He's a good craftsman,and that shows. The film is racy enough, and the villain, albeit too theatrical, but still tends to be creepy. If u've never seen the chaser, this will prove to be a good thriller for u. If u have, U will see flaws. It's not as gritty as the original, but it's somewhat close. There are a few sex scenes, but I hope by now cinema-goers are used to it. Nothing too offensive, trust me. Jacqueline is OK, a better actress might have done wonders. Emraan, like always, is quite fierce, but just falls short. The script is to be blamed for that. Prashant is a brilliant actor and deserves better roles, this is not one of them, but still a good showcase of his skills. I just hope that they did an Indian version of it, not just copy it. Rajkumar Gupta did wonders with Cavite's script (Aamir, anyone)..." 
" Music is a plus point of the movie","Emraan Hashmi and Prashant Narayan (I loved him in Yeh Saali Zindagi) were just splendid! Jacqueline is supposed to be the eye candy and she does it well. She adds more spice than Mallika Sherawat.Music is a plus point of the movie. Aye Khuda is shot in a brilliant way (Mohit Suri did the same thing in Awarapan). Haal – E – Dil sounds good too. Background score by Raju Singh is okay.The fault with the movie is in its screenplay. Due to the urge to mix up erotica with thriller, Shagufta Rafique messes with the flow of the movie. Dialogues are crisp. The actions and visuals were dark and intense, apt to the theme.Overall, Mohit Suri had his heart and mind on the correct track while making the movie, but if the story and screenplay were better (or should I say logical); the movie would have worked wonders. A worth watch anyways!" 
" Nice and Entertaining","After a long time I have watched a thriller which I really enjoyed. The movie isn't that great but has a decent story line and some really frightening scenes (not much though).Emraan Hashmi does a good job. Jaqueline Fernandis doesn't have much role in the movie. She is just in 2 songs and 2 scenes. (I personally don't like it when the girl is used only to increase the "glamour" quotient of the movie and has no proper role). The villain (don't know his name) is too good and scary. Music is okay. A few minutes after the start, the movie picks up pace. Emraan Hashmi is a good actor. Don't know why he isn't considered among the top stars in India. Overall, a good and enjoyable movie." 
" Good for scary movie-lovers - go for it","Murder 2, the much anticipated sequel is surprisingly very different to the original Murder. If you want to watch this film for its erotic aspect alone, you'll be somewhat disappointed with the lack of originality as several recent Bollywood flicks have turned sex into an over-rated, oversold theme. However the serial-killer dimension is a novelty - all the blood, gore, darkness and intimidation blends into a perfect plot to literally scare the living daylights out of you, pun intended. This movie is clearly a popcorn fest and recommended to be seen when you have been bored like hell or had a very bad day at the workplace. Please don't watch if your mood is cheerful - Murder 2 is far too disturbing. An A certificate is justified and children should be prevented from coming close to a DVD release. As for the performances, every actor played his/her part quite well. Jacqueline looks beautiful, Emraan comes sharp-witted with his dialogue delivery but the real scene stealer was Prashant Narayan who brought great conviction and authenticity to his serial killer role. He should undoubtedly win some kind of Best villain award." 
" Edgy, chilling and spicy","Murder 1 was inspired from "Unfaithful" and now this one, from "Chaser", It's awful to see Mahesh Bhatt replicating the English movies.Now, talking about the movie, the makers have chosen a very smart way of banking the brand "Murder". The sequel is not at all the sequel. Nothing apart from the makers are same in this movie. But in order to create some hype and sensation, screenplay and story are hampered and unnecessary sex scenes are mixed in an uncanny way.Emraan Hashmi and Prashant Narayan (I loved him in Yeh Saali Zindagi) were just splendid! Jacqueline is supposed to be the eye candy and she does it well. She adds more spice than Mallika Sherawat.Music is a plus point of the movie. Aye Khuda is shot in a brilliant way (Mohit Suri did the same thing in Awarapan). Haal – E – Dil sounds good too. Background score by Raju Singh is okay.The fault with the movie is in its screenplay. Due to the urge to mix up erotica with thriller, Shagufta Rafique messes with the flow of the movie. Dialogues are crisp. The actions and visuals were dark and intense, apt to the theme.Overall, Mohit Suri had his heart and mind on the correct track while making the movie, but if the story and screenplay were better (or should I say logical); the movie would have worked wonders. A worth watch anyways!" 
" Murder 2 - Must watch movie, well done Emraan Hashmi & Mahesh Butt Team","The movie opening spoils the suspense and expectation of viewers, if they would have expected emotional setup similar to Murder 1. Of course it has romantic scenes but limited, but the thriller part of the movie was handled very well and keeps the audience busy on thinking on what to expect next and how worse the things can turn in reality if something really goes wrong. In overall this is another movie from Emraan, where he proves that he can manage any kind of role - superbly.Special credit goes to the villain for his good acting, however he could have done further better and the Reshma has done v good job." 
" Best psychological thriller movie.The ending was emotional.","The movie is good.Copied from The chaser it's nice.The first part was copied from unfaithful and this one from chaser. The acting by Emraan Hasmi was nice as a gangster and an ex cop.Its a dark intense and a lit scary film.A lit bit better than its first part.The acting from Prashant Narayan was awesome.The way he acted like a psycho was good.Nice direction by Mohit as expected.The story is good.The tension was good and the last killing was intense.Editing was good Songs were nice.The ending was very sad and emotional.I love this kinda serial killer movies A must watch film for those who loves psychological thriller movies." 
" A really bad attempt","Before coming to this site I was convinced that this movie is one of the lesser quality original productions of Mahesh Bhat, but after coming here I am convinced that this movie is a poor quality reproduction of the Korean movie, "The Chaser".But I will still treat this movie as a original production and offer the following comments:To really like this movie you need to believe in the following1. A horribly inept police force 2. Murder stories have an completely emotional story line and absolutely zero logic 3. A dumb Pimp Mafia or whateverFrom the beginning the police force is a mere spectator giving emotional responses after our hero has performed. Forget everything about them doing their job. Forget completely about logic and the less i mention it the better i will feel, but let me give an example anyway. A girl is facing south when she is being murdered but is facing north when our hero sees her. As for our Pimp mafia, well they are dumb enough not to realize that all the girls are disappearing after a particular customer calls, Our hero has to point this out after approx 13 have disappeared. I am a bit foggy about the numbers as is the movie.Please do read the plot summary of The Chaser before you watch this movie and you will probably forgive the producer for blatantly trying to copy Kevin Spacey's character from Seven, or for introducing a heroine who is actually not required in the script. You might also forgive the honest media that is full of reviews and promotions but does not hint that this is a copied movie so standards may vary, or fall completely..." 
" Go for it !!!","I loved this movie ! Jacqueline does a good job although she waan't in many scenes !It was such a long time after emraan did a fair job to his movie . The songs were also awesome. If you are looking for a good thriller go for it. With the last part of Harry Potter due next week, you can have a good fun with this.A few minutes after the start, the movie picks up pace. Emraan Hashmi is a good actor. Don't know why he isn't considered among the top stars in India. Overall, a good and enjoyable movie.The movie keeps you busy for the entire 127 mins.Upto 15 mins into the start there are some "scenes" but after that nothing like that, so if you are looking for family plan, you can go for it. (considering the fact murder wasn't so) ! ;)" 
" Average, Copied Flick!","The Silence Of The Lambs & The Chaser juxtaposed together with a hot, useless actress and a serial kisser. And you get Murder 2.I don;t why Wikipedia says it is a quasi-sequel to the 2004 film Murder. But, as in this film, the plot is too cheesy and copied from both of the aforementioned hit films. Emraan Hashmi is lukewarm while the vindictive villain does a very good job. Jacqueline is a waste and no pivotal role to play.Overall, performances were appreciative and the songs were very good. Direction is average and cinematography is poor. Lots of plot holes and goofs here and there makes this one watchable, NOT!BOTTOM LINE: It is yet another Bhatt gimmick and there's no entertainment in this. Only gore & stupidity.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOLanguage: Critical | Sex: Critical | Nudity: Critical | Mouth-Kiss & Foreplay: Very Critical | Smoking, Alcohol or Drugs: No | Violence: Critical | Gore: Very Critical" 
" Sex and Murder=idiotic movie","OK, this movie is a prime example of how some of the Indian population rates movies. This movie was actually a box office hit.Let's start. Firstly, the cover of the movie shows Jacqueline Fernandes and Emraan Hashmi in a lot of highly sexual scenes. This is enough to get at least 60% of the population interested even without looking at the plot. The girls will watch it for Emraan and the guys will watch it for Jacqueline.Second, what does this movie teach? It teaches that a murderer can kill over 12 girls and not get caught by the police, instead he gets caught by an ex-cop. Then, even after the murderer confesses to his crime, he is actually able to walk out of the police station scott free. Then, he kills the person who freed him plus another girl while police were parked right outside the place where he was doing the killing.What will people think when they watch this movie? They'll think Indian cops are a bunch of idiots who let sociopaths get away even after they confess to a crime in the police station.Now anyone who knows psychology knows that this guy didn't have a problem with his sexual identity. He had an anti-social personality disorder. Watch Dexter, a TV series, if you don't understand.I'm just disappointed and ashamed, since I'm an Indian myself, I know there are waaay better movies out there. I know that kids in India will be watching this since nobody cares about the ratings there.Even after this, it's still a box office success! Yay go erotic advertising and hormones!I do have to say one good thing about this movie - the music. Every song in this movie is amazing!" 
" Dark,violent and scary.Not for the light-hearted","Murder 2,the latest installment from Mohit Suri has nothing in connection with the original Murder,but has its own dose of entertainment in store for the audience.It has been inspired by the Korean slasher film The Chaser.The film is strictly not recommended for the children and the light-hearted and may be disturbing for them.Good performances,excellent music and protruding darkness make it an entertaining fare for the people who love erotic thrillers.The main highlight of the movie is a stellar performance by Prashanth Narayan.It is certainly one among the best crime thrillers to be made in Bollywood.Box office reports of the movie is excellent and has a steady collection for the first week.Prashanth Narayan steals the limelight with his psycho-killer mannerisms.Emran Hashmi does his job quiet well. Jaquiline Fernandez has nothing much to play than to show some flesh and hot scenes.Sulagna Panigrahi is a talent to lookout for future and does a commendable job.Some +ves::Excellent music,Good performance by Prashanth Narayan and Sulagna Panigrahi,Cinematography by Ravi Walia,Fast paced first half and Shagufta Rafique's dark screenplay. Some -ves::Absence of any connection with Murder 1,Some heavily disturbing scenes,Little bit slow second half and Not so appreciable editing work.Music by Harshit Saxena,Mithoon,Sangeet Haldipur,Siddharth Haldipur is really melodious,touching and mind soothing.The album is one of the best musicals of 2011 and can be rated a 8.5/10.Verdict::Murder 2 is an entertaining crime thriller with some good performances and music,which has nothing in connection with its prequel.Go 4 a darker,sleazier entertainer.Not recommended for the light-hearted.Ma Rating::7.5/10" 
" A good Thriller","A very good movie... Emraan Hashmi has played his character pretty well. Story line is superb. Mahesh Bhatt again with a controversial topic and did full justice with it. Music is superb.. A must watch movie and highly appreciated role played by villain.The suspense in the movie is ultimate... Its full money back guarantee movie.. Jacquilene don't have much to do in the movie. Full movie goes around Emraan Hashmi who is Ex cop Arjun Dixit.. He is on the Mission to Save Reshma from the villain. I don't want to reveal the Suspense of the movie, so guys go and watch Murder 2."
