" For Teens","This film is clearly a shameless copy of "A Cindarella Story" (2004) and if you've seen it you can't help but constantly compare every scene, dialogue and characters to the original one.Nevertheless, I'll try to review this film separately for what it's worth.The plot is easy to follow and predictable, but it's still pleasant to watch. The actors do a good job, especially the two step-sisters with their neither irritating nor over the top constant trifling quarrels and the best friend Raj with his charming and friendly manners. The lead actress manages to pull off a decent Cindarella. Unfortunately, her Prince, despite his good looks, wasn't convincing in his acting and his swimming abilities? He surely wouldn't win a gold medal for that.Throughout the film it was painful to witness Cindarella and her Prince, both aspiring WRITERS, texting each other...r u serious? Wr is the proper spelling?!Even with the fairy tale ending, the film was left incomplete (what happened to her scholarship?).It's an alright easy teen Bollywood film and I assume more enjoyable if you haven't seen the Hollywood version of it."
