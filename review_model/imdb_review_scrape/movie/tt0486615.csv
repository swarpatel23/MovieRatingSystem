" London Dreams: 80% awesome!","I have been waiting for London Dreams since the days Rajkumar Santoshi was the director, the movie kept on delaying, and was eventually shelved. Later, Vipul Shah picked it up and the movie started rolling. Because of the name Vipul Shah (Aankhen, Namastey London, Waqt) and the wonderful cast of Salman Khan, Ajay Devgn and Asin was known, I was expecting a spectacular musical.The movie did give me a satisfying feeling, though it missed out on a few things, unfortunately. The first half is very entertaining and keeps the viewers interested, the climax is also very gripping. Just the ending spoiled it all, it feels like Vipul Shah forced the movie to end, it could have been so much better.Performance wise Salman Khan stood out once again, Salman carried the whole movie on his shoulders, he was very entertaining and very convincing. Asin looked beautiful and delivered a good performance, though her role was kind of small. Ajay Devgn was wonderful, the intensity of his character was visible in his very expressive eyes during the whole film. Everyone thinks the music of this film is very weak, I disagree because I feel the movie is good, not great though. Barso, Mann ko ati bhave, Khwab jo, are foot tapping. The Wembley song performance by Ajay could have been a different composition.The defect of the movie only lies within the last 7 minutes of the movie, which is such a pity, because I really liked the initial 2 and a half hours. You should go for this movie if you want to see gripping performances, great cinematography and emotions. Don't watch the movie if you hate movies which have very bad endings!Overall I would rate this movie 8 out of 10, because of superb Salman Khan, Ajay Devgn, Asin, the direction to a certain extent, and the great locales." 
" A good take on professional jealousy but with a feeble musical score.","Vipul Shah once again returns with his uniform Punjabi flavour & the India-London theme. Taking another step ahead of his "Namaste London", this time he impressively comes up with a good take on pop singers and the back stage drama in their over famous lives. But in an otherwise well directed, intense and emotional drama, he is sadly not accompanied by an equally enjoyable musical score (as in Namaste London), which was much needed by the subject and its script. So minus the songs and uninspiring music, here we have a well directed movie with some entertaining & enlightening moments and a worth watching climax (again subtracting the last song).With a story about changing relationships between two childhood friends, "London Dreams" starts with a notable opening dialogue from Ajay Devgan and then moves into the flashback of the same overused fields of Punjab. After a few introductory scenes, a song and 20 minutes into the movie, enters Salman Khan, who simply sets the screen on fire with his superb effortless acting and hilarious comic timing. From here on the film takes off in actual terms giving way to a brilliant in-flight sequence where Salman interacts with the passengers, an airhostess and the security men in his own impeccable style. And then the first half ends with a well conceived on-stage sequence, which successfully excites you enough to see the rest of it.Post interval the narration moves into more serious matters, showcasing the cut-throat competition between artists, the feeling of jealousy among themselves and the evil games they play to taste success in their professional lives. The emotional conflict between Ajay and Salman further leads to a completely unexpected and splendidly conceived climax which gives new meaning to the spirit of friendship between two artists and childhood friends. In fact the climax sequence of Salman and Ajay at the Railway Station rightly deserves to be applauded for its superb writing and enlightening execution. Salman straight away wins the heart of every single viewer in the theater, coming up with a completely unimaginable solution to the problem existing between the two friends and gives a new meaning to the "Art of Forgiving". But a whole song after their re-union was not creative or intelligent from any angle and the movie should have ended right at the Railway Station.Performance wise Salman comes at the top with a great act, which includes comedy, emotion, tragedy and even trauma of a drug addict. Ajay Devgan gives another intense and explosive performance different from his current famous comedy movies. He looks dashing in his rough performer getup, but lacks the youthfulness and body flexibility of a rock artist. In other words, he seems to be quite stiff in his stage acts and moreover his self torture scenes were also not needed at all. They give you the feeling of Deja vu, like the one seen in Amitabh's "Mahaan". Asin is breath-taking gorgeous and looks much better than "Ghajini". Her short Sita-Gita act was enjoyable only because she looked equally beautiful in both kind of dresses.Om Puri is cool and calm in his few scenes and notable dialogues but Ranvijay Singh gives an OK performance in his debut movie. He looked more confident in his "Roadies" act on the small screen. Aditya Roy Kapur, as Ranvijay's brother is impressive & Brinda Parekh repeats her act of "Corporate".It can be said that director Vipul Shah is back with a commendable effort talking about the ugly side of human characters who happen to be stage artists in the current script. But the theme is equally relevant in any business form in this cunning monetary world. Vipul realistically directs few praiseworthy sequences in the movie like the one where Salman transforms two lines of a song in different kind of compositions having different tastes and the worth watching emotional climax scene at the railway station. However, along with these well directed ones, he also delivers a questionable sequence, when all the four members of the band except Ajay freely move out of the Wembley Stadium's green rooms to the lonely, dark backyards, breaking all the security circles, on the very night of their much awaited performance.Unfortunately, Vipul majorly faulted on his choice of compositions for a project which entirely talks about a musical band and its members. For such a script based on music itself, the songs and score by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is too feeble to get register.In fact the most important song of the movie, which the band plays at their night in the Wembley Stadium, is completely uninspiring and boring. On the other hand the cinematography captures the essence of the subject superbly. The stage sequences and the Wembley have been shot real well along with some great computer graphics.Conversely, I wondered that if a project is around Punjab and also requires a great amount of Punjabi language, music and feel to be incorporated into it, then why not they hire some actual Punjabi Professionals for the job, who can rightly guide them about the Punjabi dialogues, their pronunciations and the Punjabi melodies in the songs. For instance, Salman keeps on calling Ajay as "Bhara" which means brother, with a faulty pronunciation.Summing up, I would like to say the "London Dreams" just missed out to become a masterpiece flick based on a good subject. It is Salman's movie all the way, who will appeal to everyone from a city professional to a village farmer. Besides him, the movie and its theme will also appeal to wannabe artists from the younger generation. But it cannot be called a finely polished product as it has many unwanted songs and scenes which could have been easily edited out. And I wish it had some good melodious songs which would have taken the brilliant performances in the movie to another level altogether." 
" A Nutshell Review: London Dreams","I've got to admit though my interest in the film is none other than to follow up on Asin's phenomenal Hindi movie debut with the blockbuster hit movie Ghajini last year, and while it took almost 12 months for the release of her latest Bollywood movie (her first real one since she starred in an earlier, original version of the same role), she's one of the many stars I'm following as my introduction to the current wave of Hindi films, from Deepika Padukone to Ranbir Kapoor, and of course the established ones, which includes Salman Khan in this same film.While one may not see Asin being featured too much on the promotions and the trailers, I suppose there's a valid reason for that. In fact, she probably got relegated, in my opinion, from leading lady in Ghajini, to supporting role in London Dreams, so much so that her character Priya becomes just one of the many background dancers in the Indian pop group band of the titular name, which is naturally a pity as the camera doesn't even linger too long to show us some of the moves learnt. However, the good thing here was that she's the token love interest in a triangle between the two leading male characters, and in pure Asin style, took advantage of whatever limited time she has to flesh out Priya as best as she could, a woman caught in between fulfilling her traditional roles in her father's household, yet caught up by the bright lights that the city has to offer, together with a totally different, perhaps more attractive pop culture to want to become a dancer. And fate would lead her to Ajay Devgn's Arjun busking at Trafalgar Square with a makeshift band made up of two brothers of Pakistani descent.If I could read this on another level going by how the plot developed, it's akin to a warning of sorts against consorting with foreign elements to harm one's own countryman, which should be an absolute no-no at any costs, because it will only open up such bonds to utter destruction. Surely the greed and jealousy of man may frustrate from time to time, but to lead to betrayal would be asking for a downfall.London Dreams plays out like a classical Cain and Abel type story, where two brothers, one jealous of the other for his talent and recognition, plots the downfall against the other behind his back in betrayal most foul. Arjun has a dream, and that is to take his music to London, and play at the renowned Wembley stadium, where his grandfather had failed in his time and returned to India a broken man. He spends his early teenage life honing his musical skills, and ever ready to sniff out any opportunity to scale the music ladder until his goal is reached. His is a singular mind obsessed with the single goal, so much so that he's willing to self-flagellate (!) himself when his mind gets swayed by Priya and the chance for romance, or any other distractions that crosses his path that day actually.Ajay Devgn plays Arjun with enough menace and envy to make him believable as a man who would go to great lengths and at any costs to ensure his road to glory is not jeopardized. Salman Khan's Mannu on the other hand, is blessed with great musical talent without even trying, and while Arjun sees this as an advantage to be gained should he bring Mannu back to London and join his band, little did he realize that Mannu's country boy demeanour would start to win the fans over, as well as Priya. There are plenty of scenes which set up this innocent usurping of another's thunder, and the decisions that come to spark off the entire turn of events just after the intermission.As a musical film, somehow the songs and dance sequences didn't really stand out, although in general they weren't that bad, but not too memorable as well, other than the pulsating number first performed at Trafalgar Square. Salman Khan proves why he's one of the three King Khans of Bollywood through his rendition of a simple boy with simple pleasures, with plenty of cheekiness combined with great comic timing to bring in some laughs. That airplane scene was a classic light hearted touch in what was a dark tale about bringing down a best friend using the cruelest of methods and exploiting the weakness of another for no good benefit.The ending too was too clean and too quick, where a pep talk magically puts one into empathy mode with perfect hindsight. I had expected a lot more from London Dreams with its premise and its cast, but what came across was something still palatable and won't get you all riled up like the audience in the film, but with potential as a successful box office dream likely going unfulfilled." 
" Either the filmmakers are retarded or they think that the viewers are!","I ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews, on the request of a female. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie. I am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it's a scam.As far as my opinion goes, I have to ask,"are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded?" The movie is atrocious on so many levels and I'm not even talking about the story or presentation.So, these bunch of guys plus one girl (the lead actress) form a Music band; guessing from the constant presence of guitars it is supposed to be a ROCK band. Hell, when did dancers started becoming the part of a Rock band??? Anyway, let me accept it as the-Bollywood-version-of-a- Rock-band, but amusingly enough all the scores which actually had these two guitarists doing all kinds of cool "ROCK GESTURES" and I am assuming they were playing the instruments, the sound of the guitar was completely missing!!! I simply can't comprehend the magnitude of stupidity here....I am just going to conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the movie. Bollywood directors seem to have no shame anymore!!!!!!!!" 
" Excellent Movie from Bollywood after a Long time","London Dreams is all about the aspiration, dreams, achievement and a few people who pursue the same. The story revolves around passion, music, friendship, aggression and the best part is it's closeness to reality with out eroding cinematic pleasure Arjun's (Ajay Devgan) dream was to perform in Wembley Stadium, London where his grand father failed to perform. He was always struck with obstructions while moving ahead with his ambition. But, music was his life and hence achieving his dream is equivalent to fight for his life. What ever be the obstacles – be it bonds of relation or anything remained only as obstacles for him. His life revolves around achievement of his dream and he parked all other priorities till when he achieved his end. Passion transforming to obsession! Manjit (Salman) was not clear about his goal in life but he always exhibited unstinted affection towards his friend. He could sing but he was happy to perform "Band Party" in Bhatinda. He is loud; happy go lucky, naïve and innocent – the typical Punjabi Villager.Arjun and Manjit complimented each other during childhood and destiny brought Arjun to London where he struggled to achieve his dream. His dream gave shape to the Band "London Dreams" – Arjun being the lead vocal, composer and lyricist got ample support from Priya (Asin) the Iyer girl who was forced to learn Bhart Natyam but wanted to perform Western Dance and Pakistani instrument players Zoheb and Wasim (Ran Vijay Singh and Aditya Kapoor).Arjun was so calculative in his move and could vouch Manjitto be a part of his dream which he obliged gracefully. Together they started their journey to fulfill the dream! All of them complimented each other in the best manner – they crossed each and every milestone! Wembley is not a distant dream ---- But when you are about to achieve your dream, you will be exposed with new challenges! Life is all about sailing through that rough terrain! Rarely people reach the shore and everything comes with a price! The journey from dream to reality is all about the plot of London Dreams.As a writer Vipul Amrit Shah created a niche where in he present poignant stories with maudlin appeal. RHTDM was not a trend setter but still provided some insight towards this craft. As a Director also, he handled similar topics in Namastey London and Waqt. Of course, he is handling a theme with music as the main theme with some lead star cast and direction becomes a precarious balancing act. Vipul did achieve this end to a great extent! The passion and aggression of Arjun, the bucolic charm of Manjit, transition of frames from rustic Punjab to London, ensemble earthy humor and emotional upsurge – as per Bollywood standards, he did an excellent job.Casting is quite important in Indian Market. Long back, Aamir and Shahrukh was about to be casted for this project and finally we have Salman and Ajay! Salman always comes up with surprises! He disappoints to the core with a movie and will ensure a dramatic return. After promising "Wanted", due to family obligations he surprised us with MAMK! Again, he came back as an excellent charmer. It won't be an exaggeration if I say that he eclipsed rest of the star cast! Having Ajay Devgan, one of the finest actors in Bollywood, achieving this end is not an easy task. True, there are no flaws with Ajay but alas, he did similar roles (Not a musician) before. Also, somehow I find it a bit odd that Ajay performing as a rock star. Might be the character of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam still lingers. But all in all, we should appreciate Ajay to accept a role like this that might bag audience sympathy to the other character. Rest of the cast including Asin, Om Puri etc. was good in their job with essential and limited screen presence.There is no better choice that Shankar – Ehsaan – Loy to compose music. It is quite natural to compare songs with that of Rock on (which is not advisable). Music might become popular over repeated hearing but with out any doubt it suits the theme even though not enough to be included as the music that might create euphoria among audience across the globe as depicted in the movie.Sejal Shah the man behind camera did magic! Especially the starry night in Bhatinda, lighting during the music performance requires excellent hand behind the camera.Suresh Nair the man behind screen play almost became an expert in handling music related themes (Jhankar Beats, Namastey London). He ensured to eliminate redundancy factor even though I could draw parallel with the central theme of Malayalam Movie "Bharatam".All in all – as per Bollywood standards, London Dreams is an excellent watch. Element of melodrama towards the end of the movie was slightly larger than life.All in all – it is a movie with out any malice. You can watch with family and friends.Salman 10/10 Ajay 8/10 Asin 7/10 Music 9/10 Movie 10/10" 
" There are so many people having time to waste anymore?","I just wondering what is the purpose of making movies like this? the profit? and to whom they are referring what intelligence must use your brain to watch something like this crap? This movie is watchable by under 3 years old children if you are adults don't try to watch it. Thats the reason i think Hollywood started to use cartoons in movies with actors like this you must forget the art of cinema , be sure that you ll have tons of pop corn to consume for time to pass till this movie ends also get many cola's hamburgers your laptop your cellphone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant but for sure not in a theater , my dog who is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building.The sure thing is that this movie is referring to people with no demands from the cinema art.The only thing that this movie can be used is for watching it when making the supermarket shopping list.I am giving 2 stars for supporting the India's cinema efforts but for nothing more or less.." 
" Crap movie","The movie is a total crap. We have two good actors who are miscast and meat-head of an actor Salman Khan(How did Indians and the glorious Indian Cinema end up with this ape, speaks his dialog like a monkey and dances like a chimpanzee!) just to attract the female audience. The story is crap. The characters poorly sketched. Non existent story telling. No editing to speak of. Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star..that is a dream in itself! The movie drags along to the point of decadence. The whole charade about Arjun bringing his Manna to London, let him grope his girlfriend and let him not play at Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process pirated in Filthystan by cousin's of Kasaba) is absurd. Salman Khan's over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good movies from this producer Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems all the good directors are falling prey to the Box Office mania..that the Mumbai Media Morons have created. This is yet another crap movie in the lines of "Wanted" with idiot actors like Salman Khan who has no place in a good Hindi Cinema. He is good to the Indian Cinema as Titanic was to the winter cruise business! On a positive note-I like Asin character dancing Bharatnatyam when she changes to the Western style dancing when the teacher is not looking." 
" Typical","The film was written 10 years back and a different director was planning it with SRK and Aamir in lead rolesThe film finally was made now with Vipul Shah directing it And Ajay and Salman starring together after a decade HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM(1999)The movie however falls short due to it's 90's handling and worst it's loopholesThe film tries to pack in too many commercial ingredients and we also hav the love triangleEverything is predictable and filmy and too clichédThere are loopholes like how Ajay runs away from London Airport and makes a place for himself with no one? even the way he starts his band is not convincing The second half gets better with the twist in the tale of Ajay destroying Salman but sadly the climax falls short and the film ends on a bad noteDirection by Vipul Shah is ordinary to below average Music is the worst point, most songs are mediocreAmongst actors Ajay gives his best shot though he isn't convincing as a Rock singer yet he does superb as the negative role Salman however irritates with his punjabi and talking nonsense he only impresses when he gets drugged and thereon Asin is nothing great just a show piece Ranvijay should stick to MTV Om Puri is okay" 
" Hard to watch","Maaan, where do i start with this god awful movie. Bad bad bad story telling. I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie. Namaste London was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest..even the soundtrack was good. But in this one..oh my good..for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one..the songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman should have been the music director. Given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director. Even though the first half sucks, the last 30 mins of the movie are OK. Performances from Salman and Ajay save the movie from being a total disaster.Watch it if you have nothing better to do. The last good movie from Bollywood i watched ( and i do watch a load of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid." 
" Superb","After Wanted this was salman's best movie i love the script specially salmans role he act superb ajay was awesome his character is rough asin look very good the whole cast was superb acting was superb this one movie is a full on performance of these actors ajay is doing good comic movies he is in a rough character in this movie which look really good on him salman was awesome he is doing really great work now days the script was really cool you must go and watch the movie yourself a little story will spoil your fun.i am sure you don't wanna miss all the fun and specially the exciting,thrilling,superb climax!! watch it by yourself!! then comment!!! :D" 
" Not worth rating!","The movie is plain bad. Simply awful. The string of bad movies from Bollywood has no end! They must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies (or not).The problem seems to be with mainly the directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performance...but they were directed so poorly. The poor script did not help either.This movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half. For instance :After his 1st big concert, Ajay Devgan, meets up with Om Puri (from whom he ran away some 30 years ago and talked to again) and all Om Puri finds to say is to beware of his friendship with Salman!!! What a load of crap. Seriously. Not to mention the baaad soundtrack. Whatever happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy?Ajay Devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstar.Only saving grace are the good performances in the second half. Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. So does Salman as the drug addict. Watch it maybe only for the last half hour." 
" Typical Bollywood Bloat","A rags-to-riches cautionary tale straight off the Bollywood assembly-line, "London Dreams" is a lengthy, superficial account of an orphaned Indian émigré who finds that life as a rising British pop star isn't all it's cracked up to be.This cliché-ridden film pads out its interminable two-and-a-half-hours-plus running time with overheated melodrama, soul-searing angst, bloated musical numbers, and cutesy slapstick routines. And, of course, it's overflowing with that kind of self-congratulatory smugness that seems to be the hallmark of so many of the commercial films coming out of India these days.The movie does take us to many colorful London locales – befitting a wide-eyed tourist from abroad - but one could get pretty much the same effect using Google street view and not have to put up with all the drama." 
" Underrated","Didnt understand why it failed at the box office...." 
" Jealously Can Make You Do Crazy Things","Story: Ajay Devgan, a man with a big dream, is joined by three people who become his band members. His best friend, Salman Khan, enters, threatening to destroy Ajay's biggest achievement. How Ajay handles this challenge forms the rest of the story.Analysis:Characters:Ajay Devgan, as the main protagonist, seems a bit old for this role but nevertheless does justice. He is neither portrayed as a hero nor villain but as an ordinary man who believes in hard work and dedication to work his way up the ladder. His character represents the motto: "You can achieve anything if you put your mind to it". Salman Khan, as the friend, is jovially and carefree. He represents the minority of people who have talent without effort. His soft nature is contrasted with Ajay's hard one, giving a ying-yang feel. As a actor, Salman was amazing, easily stealing Ajay's thunder.Asin plays a girl from a strict Iyer family, who loves dancing. Her character was unnecessary as it was not properly etched out. As a backup dancer, she easily could have just been a random person getting some camera attention. Her presence was overshadowed by both Ajay's and Salman's relationship, making her forgettable. Rannvijay Singh Singha & Aditya Roy Kapur are brothers in the movie who parallel Ajay and Salman's relationship. Their characters reinforce the struggle between Ajay and Salman. Both were good, with one sharing the same dreams as Ajay and the other trying to hold the band together. Like Asin, they were not necessary to the script. They did not add any substance.Om Puri plays Ajay's uncle, is also seen as the man with wisdom. He is a voice that guides Ajay throughout his journey. He does not add anything to the film. Storyline/Screenplay: The concept was good. It was something different and the emotions raw. There were some scenes that showed what humans, in order to remove perceived obstacles, are capable of.Songs: The songs by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy were another highlight of the film. Soft rock mixed with different styles of music really showcased the talent of the trio. It proves that not every song has to be romantic to be a hit. A couple of minor nuance was that sometimes Salman and Ajay were not in sync when singing at the concerts (maybe it was the copy) and sometimes the voices between the two would change even though the background singer was the same. Other Technical Aspects: The direction was done beautifully, the editing good. Cinematography was amazing. All three aspects really captured the emotions that were portrayed. The movie was fast-paced and cleanly portrayed the struggles, both emotionally and physically, between all the actors. Final Product: This movie was good but has a selective audience." 
" Good Presentation, Great Acting but confused ending","Another Vipul Shah Movie after hits like Waqt,Namaste London, Singh Is King. In theater we people had lots of expectation from this one, Starting is dashing which shows the bond between two friends Arjun(Ajay) and Mannu (Salman). How they grew up, choose their career, maintained friendship, their sacrifice for each other. Story line is perfect, acting is excellent, direction is good, but the movie lacks in the freshness, music and specially confused ending. Salman is at its best, and tries hard to make us laugh, even impressive in emotional role too. Asin was okay as an confused girl who didn't decide she loves Salman or not. Aditya Roy Kapur and Ranvijay are good in supporting role. Ajay Devgan was not upto mark, as he plays the negative role in the movie, but he was clearly unpresentable in the role of a Jealous Musician and silent lover. Though he does an excellent work in Deewangee as an silent lover and musician, but here he spoils the movie. Music was also bad expect 1-2 track. I will give 6/10 to this movie. Salman is the only saving grace of the movie." 
" Best Movie of the year 2009","Arright so I don't really write any comments on IMDb although I never watch a movie without checking its rating or unless the movie is worth taking risk of wasting time. I have seen many films revolving around the story line of Friendship and ambitions however this one left a mark in my heart. The acting of Salman Khan was outstanding, I must say one of the best I have seen till now. Ajay Devgan on the other hand have played his role quite well. After Hum Dil de Chukay Sanam this movie proved that both Salman and Ajay makes a good team with each other and. Story is about a dream of a boy from a small town of Punjab who wanted to become a musician but his father have bitter memories with music so he was basically an obstacle between him and his dreams However destiny had something else for him and his father died suddenly. His Uncle came from London and took him away leaving behind his childhood friend Salman khan who on the other hand always use to avoid music but his father wanted his to learn it. Ajay then went to London with his Uncle but on his way to London he found out that his uncle thinks the same way about music, He ran away from the airport and lived on his own to fulfill his dreams, he explored his talents and worked really hard to achieve his goals and become successful but his dream of performing at Wembley was yet to come true. He brings his childhood friend Salman Khan from Punjab and together they worked in Ajay's band called London Dreams. The movie is filled with everything from Emotions, romance, music to comedy. Every one have been amazing and the theme of the movie is definitely going to get appreciation around the globe. The movie deserves some awards and specially the actors who gave it the magic touch. I personally do not think that there could have been any better alternates then Salman and Ajay in this movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who have waited for a unique story line for quite some time."
