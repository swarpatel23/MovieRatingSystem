" A cool comedy thriller","The movie was quite good with many twists and turns although it's a comedy thriller and they both don't match. Everyone did a good job in the film and Upen Patel was OK for his first film. I thought it was going to be rubbish but as usual Abbas-Mustan's films are always good. Their films are always copies but they turn out to be better than the original especially Disclosure which was so rubbish that I only seen the first 20 minutes but Aitraaz was brilliant. The best thing is that they're not a complete copy only the basic plot e.g.: 36 China Town- Chinatown (1974) Aitraaz- Disclosure (1994)Humraaz- A Perfect Murder (1998) Ajnabee- Consenting Adults (1992)Daraar- Sleeping with the Enemy (1991)Baazigar- A Kiss Before Dying (1991)" 
" Johnny Lever and Paresh are Superb!!!!","Never had any expectations from this movie. Abbas-Mustan are the directors who have taken full responsibility to remake all the Hollywood movies in to Bollywood. Originality is alien to them. Remember Aitraz (Disclosure), Daraar (sleeping with the enemy), Baadshah (Nick of time)etc.. ?? I gave in to the force of my friends to watch this flick. As expected it's not a brilliant movie. Surprisingly, it succeeded in evoking few good laughs here and there. It is stylish and performance are up to the mark. Johnny Lever and Paresh Rawal are superb!!. Just watch the movie for them (Vote 7/10 is just for them). Finally, I was not able to figure out, from which Hollywood flick, was this inspired..any guesses??" 
" Entertaining, despite being a blatant copy!!","Even though Abbas Mastan claim that the inspiration for this movie came to them while watching Chinatown (1974), the movie is actually a scene-by-scene lift of the 1992 Hollywood comedy Once Upon a Crime, starring John Candy and Cybill Shepherd. Interestingly, that movie was also billed as a comedy-mystery, but was also much more comedy than mystery, like this one.The roles played by Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor were played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young in the original. The plot has been Indianized: the main events in the original happen in Monte Carlo, and here, they happen in Goa, which is kind of the Monte Carlo of India. Several other aspects of the plot have been Indianized: for example, the two protagonists in the original are returning a lost dog (in this, they are returning a lost child). But several things are not changed at all, including the character of the married-for-money Paresh Rawal (played by John Candy in the original), the suave Casanova Upen Patel (played by George Hamilton in the original), and the inspector Akshaye Khanna (played by Giancarlo Giannini).Despite having seen the original, I found this version to be highly entertaining. Especially impressive was Shahid Kapoor, who has excellent chemistry with Kareena. Akshaye Khanna does not have a very strong part, but still tries very hard. Overall, the movie does not disappoint." 
" Good Show...Gr88 Entertainer","Of course this starts with the usual Bollywood movies..with a lot of songs...But the story starts taking its grip gradually. Great chemistry between Shahid and Kareena, real good comedy by Paresh, Johhny...Upen Sucks!!! but this guy has potential to do something gr888...Upen needs to be selective in his role....All in all a great entertainer and would be really more entertaining for you too, if you just go ahead and watch the movie without knowing the ending. Its just superb...The songs are good and the title track is the best one...Watch out for the remix version at the end..its really picturised very well...Go ahead and enjoy the MASALA!!!!" 
" More comedy than a thriller","This movie is a typical bollywood film, keep your thinking caps at home and you can enjoy the movie thoroughly. The first half an hour drags on with 3 (!!) songs, but after that the things pick up. In fact all the scenes seem to have been stretched to give the film its running time. Akshaye Khanna makes an entry just after the interval. Now if the film followed the logical rules of life, it should have ended after half an hour from the interval. But all the suspects lie like kindergarten kids and complicate the matter. Even after all this there is hardly any suspense at all. But the ample comedy, good songs and Upen Patel makes up for all this. Upen Patel's performance deserves a mention, he really exudes that cool persona. Rest all are usual. So all in all its a good enough time pass, provided one is not paying the multiplex prices." 
" Make no mistake this is no thriller its a comedy involving a Murder.","I went into this movie expecting a stylised(somewhat overly) thriller from Abbas-Mastan duo and boy was I surprised.The movie started off like expected with a stylised flashback and a decent attempt to merge to the stories of a few individuals but it was all different and confusing since then.In fact everything about this movie and the motives behind it such as packaging it as a thriller and the dozen ploy holes (maybe more i lost count after a while) are confusing.I've reviewed this movie like a comedy with a murder involved maybe even like a spoof as THIS MOVIE CANNOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE CALLED A THRILLER AND ANYONE GOING INTO THIS MOVIE EXPECTING ONE WILL BE SEVERELY Disappointed also if i did review this movie as a thriller than even one star would be to much.The story of this movie is promising enough with a few bumbling people all landing up at the same time at China Town(sic) in Goa at the same time a murder happens.The characters are all caricatures with the henpecked husband, the suave playboy, the tough cop, the bumbling sidekicks etc. Even so they are all tolerable and the performances by everyone is good given the limited premise of the movie.Special mention to Upen Patel (who I'm sure is dubbed) who has had a decent debut and Johny Lever who thanks to his short hiatus from films (and the fact that his Numero Uno status as the most annoying guy in Bollywood being taken over by Rajpal Yadav) is actually quite tolerable in this film. However he and Paresh Rawal have nothing new to offer in terms of their roles. In fact Item Girl Payal Rohtagi also gave a decent performance.The songs in this film save for the first one are probably the worst part of this film as they completely destroyed the flow of the film and were played when you least wanted it. In fact one could easily hear the collective sigh of the audience when yet another HIMMESBHAI song was played.The comedy is nothing special though a few scenes especially those involving the interrogation of the Suspects was hilarious. Some of the scenes even though they were predictable had me falling out my seat laughing.Also a really funny person throughout the movie was the Stupid Junior Cop who was Akshaye Khannas sidekick all his one liners were absolutely hilarious.The sets of this film were actually quite good although the crude labeling of the Casino was very annoying (come one people are gambling inside we all know its a casino).Which brings us to Murder Mystery...the lesser said the better there were a dozen plot holes it was shoddily done and completely unimportant I'm sure almost no one in the audience cared who the killer was....hell it was so bad that the killer actually cracks a joke about the killing after being caught WTF.Save for the first ten minutes when this movie tries to be a thriller this movie is actually funny.A good comedy (maybe even a spoof)but the obtrusive songs and the fact that this movie was not supposed to be comedy and a thriller affect its ratings.Watch this movie if you want to see a good comedy with the background of a murder mystery.PS maybe subhash ghai saw the box office of the recent comedies and repackaged this movie as a thriller to con us whatever be the reason this movie will definitely reflect negatively against him." 
" Murder mystery plus comedy of errors in the gambling resort of Goa.","From the opening in Goa, this seems to be a film about the relentlessly meaningless problems of the entitled, the rich, the decadent, and the pointless. That is, the fat-cat parasites who live in lavish settings in the resort city of Goa, India. Gambling seems to be one of the main tools for separating fools from their money. As the film progresses one sees other means of separating the money: exotic dancers, gigolos, corruption in the film industry, and so on. Playboy/gigolo Rocky seems to be at the center of everything; we'll see how long that lasts. He seems to enjoy staying with Sonia Chang at 36 China Town, the address/name of her mansion.Meanwhile, in Mumbai, Raj made a music video which a director likes. However, he blew his savings making it, and no longer has the 1 million he needs to bribe the director to get a lead role. Priya thought she had a boyfriend interested in marrying her. Instead, he wants from her father a couple of million to start a business; if the business goes well, perhaps another million will lead to a marriage.Priya and Raj (after a rocky start) 'adopt' a missing child in order to collect a 2.5 million reward. They just have to travel to Goa to collect it from the child's putative mother, Mrs. Sonia Chang. Unfortunately for them, the ultra-wealthy Sonia gets murdered 60 minutes into the film.An alternate thread follows two hopeless gamblers through their ups and downs. Major losses, good-sized wins, bad blows to family fortunes are detailed. Sounds like possible homicide motives.Priya and Raj find 36 China Town. The lights are dim and the doors unlocked. Bad signs? They go in anyway. They discover the body. They call in the murder anonymously, but Raj gets apprehended by Inspector Karan when he goes back to the scene. He manages for a bit to keep Priya and the baby out of it.Meanwhile, one of the gamblers finds body parts in one of his suitcases. Great stuff. Priya gets noticed, then arrested. The gambler and his wife get arrested when the body parts are discovered. Karan sorts things out. He finds the other gambler and asks to talk to his wife as well. Ah, the construction of lies is such a convoluted thing! Kana arrests the second gambler as well.Kana lets his seven suspects go, and tells them not to leave Chinatown's Silver Jubilee.Lovely ending. Three stars goes to four.------Scores-------Cinematography: 8/10 Pleasant to the eye for the most part. The reverse video passages seem both needless and repellent.Sound: 4/10 Yikes, major problems here. First, the subtitles are absent in passages. Second, where they are present, they tend to be sixty or so frames lagging behind the video. Third, conversations tend to have the hollow sound associated with badly miked actors.Acting: 7/10 Reasonable. Liked the performance of Akshaye Khanna, as I did in Aap Ki Khatir.Screenplay: 7/10 Needs compression. The story does move along, but has too much filler.Musical Numbers: 7/10 Mixed bag. The single biggest reason I watch Bollywood films is the presence of good musical numbers. The dancing, the vibrant singing, the frequent humor, and the good-hearted silliness are a treat. In this film, though, there is way too much use of audio filters that cancel out the quality of full frequency singing. The filtering delivers castrated mush; the usual richness is defeated. It's like dropping back to 1960s audio quality. Some of the later ones were better." 
" gr8 film to entertain yourself","I think the film itself was gr8 as i watched it at home wondering it would be a thriller. It wasn't exactly a thriller but still a great film to watch as it contains good songs, good characters, a lot of comedy for entertainment etc. Go and watch this film if you haven't already seen it. You'll definitely be pleased....and why do you have to write minimum of 10 lines, for freaks sake, come on. i don't know what else to writeand now I'm just getting bored because IMDb isn't letting me to submit my commenthow gay is thatflippin hell" 
" a light thriller","Talking about success of 36 China Town is also talking about repeated success of its directors duo Abbas Mustan who started off as directors in Hindi films more than 15 years ago with a flop Agneekaal (1990). Such a high success rate that is increasingly getting rare in the Hindi film industry is a miracle in itself. The reason that I can think of is with each of their film they reinvented themselves. Therefore, in this musical masala thriller flick, their audience not just getting a taste of a regular Abbas-Mustan stuff but something extra and therefore that bit of surprise element is always there. Like always, their scripts are very ordinary and plot quite common, but their presentation, treatment and handling make all the difference. In this flick for example, they crafted a thriller that is the core but as usual is not great and neither is their suspense but surely this is not a genre film and therefore they bring the elements of comedy (the highlight of the film), Romance, Foot-tapping Music as well as sufficient skin show make all the difference. Therefore we have Kareena, Payal Rohatgai, Tanushree Dutta, Ishaa Koppikar, Sambhavana Sheth all displaying either their legs or their cleavage, the male counterpart is taken care of solely by the model-turned-actor Upen Patel (a confident debut though need to work hard on his dialog accent). Also, direction flaws are galore-How can a body of a 6" female be fitted into a luggage of 3"?, How can the same luggage thrown inside the A/C. compartment of a running train that too from the train's window?, how can two people see that a tunnel is approaching while traveling in the same train? and how come police not able to find passport of Kareena Kapoor at the murder site when someone has dropped it there. But come on, how many of us really care for such silly logics? Dialogues by Anurag Prapanna & Jitendra Parmar definitely tickle your funny bone at places. Himesh Reshammiya is rocking here too with another hit soundtrack under his belt. Editing by AM's Bhai is crisp as usual. Imagine, a whodunit flick which is treated in a lighter vein, with lot of drama but no melodrama plus hardly any action, is what makes this fare, a surprising watchable stuff, is all can be said about the film.." 
" Decent thriller--good songs and performances","36 China Town is a decent thriller with an interesting storyline, although there is absolutely nothing new about it. Abbas-Mastan don't live up to their name after delivering suspense-packed films like Aitraaz, Humraaz, and Ajnabee. 36 China Town is not an edge-of-the-seat thriller, which is a characteristic that has by now become expected from the director duo. This movie still proves to be entertaining thanks to great songs, great performances, and a decent story. Himesh Reshammiya's seems to have the Midas touch in 2006 by striking gold once again with his very catchy tunes. Plus, the songs have been picturized magnificently. Kareena Kapoor looks absolutely stunning. Both Kareena and Shahid give terrific performances. Upen Patel wasn't that good. Akshaye Khanna, Payal Rohatgi, and Isha Koppikar were all good. Paresh Rawal and Johnny Lever made a good comic combo. There were several nice, humorous moments in the film." 
" If you like a thriller/comedy this is the movie 4 u","This movie was very good as it being a bollywood movie. Unlike an ordinary attempt to create a murder mystery, this time bollywood has definitely done the right thing. They left no loose ends or wandering questions although some pointless songs which turned out 2 b a figment of some very powerful imagination from shahid and kareena and upen patel in this film was SOOOO HOT!! omg he was incredible. and the role he played so suited him. Paresh Rawal and Johnny Lever guarantee this a good comedy and work together comically to settle their debts. THIS FILM IS GOOD AND WATCH IT AND HOW IT IS VERY GOOD AND Definitely COVERED THE ANGLE OF THE ONE U LEAST SUSPECT!" 
" Great Suspense Flick","36 China Town is Shahid's first movie with Abbas-Mustan.Expectations from Shahid's fans are high: -How is Shahid's performance?After all this is his first movie since December. -How is Shahid and Kareena's chemistry?They both have stated it's better than FidaWell let's answer those questions:Performance is great while the chemistry is getting better.Story: Shahid wants to become an actor.He tells his parents,they get mad,he runs away,meets Kareena and they fall in love.They find a child and they take the child back to their house, 36 China Town.When they get there the head of the house is dead.They weren't the only ones in the house.Johnny Lever and his wife were there.Paresh Rawal was there.Shahid and Kareena were there.and Upen Patel was there.Akshaye Khanna is the detective trying to figure everything out.Positives: -Shahid's performance -Akshaye's performance -Music -Story and screenplay -Direction -Shahid's Dancing -Shahid and Kareena's chemistry is much better than Fida -The scenes with Paresh and JohnnyNegatives: -Upen PatelPerformances: Upen is OK.Nothing to boast about. Paresh was as usual. Johnny and his wife were loud but funny. Tanushree looked nice. Priyanka Chopra did OK. Kareena was great in her part Akshaye did very well which surprised me.Much better than his last release Shaadi Se Pehle Shahid did his role with such ease.This is easily one of his best performances.Direction: This is one of Abbas-Mustan's finest work to date.They handled every frame beautifully.Music: Himesh's music fit with the narrative.All in all a wonderful film.The movie starts like a normal Bollywood flick then you're at the edge of your seat at intermission,and you're shocked at the climax.But i won't give the ending away.9.5/10" 
" Brilliant murder mystery with great comical timing!","Great movie - i never thought a comedy and a murder mystery could mix in so well with 36 China Town! all performances were great, especially Shahid and Akshay Khanna. Paresh Rawal and Johnny Lever are great and give the movie an x factor. Kareena and the rest of the female cast do well too, and Upen fits the character well - not a bad attempt for a debut.the best part was the audience were intact within the movie as there were only 3 main sets - the casino, 36 china town, and the police station! outline story - shahid and kareena find a missing child and as they go to the house to deliver him, the mother is murdered! all is not as it seems as 5 other footprints are found! which means there were 7 people involved... whose guilty and who's innocent?" 
" Fair enough","Not being one to carry my analytical part to a movie theater, especially for a bollywood movie, i pretty much enjoyed this movie.The songs, apart from the first and last one, are stuffed in the movie for no reason at all.Akhshay Khanna is wonderful and so are Paresh Rawal and Johny Lever. Upen Patel is OK.Direction pretty crisp.The suspense is built up nicely and the end is shocking.. some said, disappointing, but OK for me as i like the movie overall except for a brief 30 minute period of the start which made me squirm and desire to go home. Glad that i stayed on." 
" Best comedy and thriller film of 2006","This is way too entertaining for me and the whole audience that watched it in the theater I enjoyed this movie allot it was cool and funny there is a very outstanding story-line in this movie great acting performances by akshaye and shah-id and Kareena and up-en Jonny is funny all the time I liked his comedy scenes with Mr pare-sh rawal there were too witty and hilarious my rating is 10 out of 10" 
" Fun Roller Coaster...","Hindi cinema is very fond of making thrilling films as it has a huge impact on audience. 36 china town is not only a thrilling film, but also a comedy film which has been mixed with other stunning elements as well. Giving a thrilling film is not easy and giving a thrilling film in a comic angle is like not possible at all. I have seen many thrilling films (mystery thrillers, but i have never seen a film like this before which satisfied me with thrilling segments and comedy as well. The director of this film is known for his work in many suspense thriller films such like Baazigar, Ajnabee, Humraaz and etc. They've established themselves as a best directing duo by these marvelous and outstanding films. Usually we can only expect suspense from them, but this time they've tried something innovative. As i described before, 36 china town is indeed a suspense thriller film but has mixed up with sublime comedies here and there. It tells a story about how several people have been mistakenly implicated in a murder plot which eventually gets solved by a smart cop. This film has a huge star cast and couple of actresses gave a guest roles in that. According to me, i like the way of this film's screenplay, because all necessary items have been included perfectly. Shahid makes a small role in this film so do kareena and other titular character, however, Paresh and Akshay did a great job in this film. the film could be able to deliver the proper recipes to audience, since majority of the film has been handle by these talented actors. The reason why i say this is because, comedy and mystery solving portions have been handled very well by paresh and akshay respectively. Plus points of this film - Amazing Screenplay, Performances, Songs, thrilling segments.Minus Points - Some scenes are quite subtle which could have been little more obvious to the audience.Please go for it. Don't miss it. Have fun ride from top to bottom."
