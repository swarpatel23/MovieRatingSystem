" Great Movie, Ignore the Haters","The movie is great, really awesome, fantastic story suspense in every step, if people aren't satisfied with this story then they can't find anything better. If this would be a Hollywood movie then people would love it. The problem is that the typical Indian audience just want family drama stuff and they can't welcome such new concepts. Overall the movie is great, a must watch movie, great action, suspense. Vivek Rocks ...... I'm waiting for it's sequels too..... The movie is actually ignored because most of the viewers don't like Vivek, to be very honest.... A great story you will find in it and stunts too than those useless super hits like Chennai Express, Ek Tha Tiger.... etc..." 
" Great Movie","Movie starts with an awesome heist over an Indian Diamond Center (surely if someday there will be a heist like this over some Indian bank no police will succeed to reach on time) and then bang movie get twisted right away, trust me i didn't watched it before because of 4/10 rating on IMDb, i watched it after Dhoom-3 and its way better than Dhoom 3, not like other movies where entry of hero takes 20 minutes, total action - drama - suspense - great start - dashing villain - great acting (yeah i know little over acting and a dull side hero), i feel just 2 things in this movie were not up to the mark 1) The over acting of Vivek 2) The Side Hero, no offense but anil kapoor may be the best choice for the super cop.All over total paisa vasul must watch" 
" One-Time Watch!","'Prince' caught my attention right from the moment I saw it's first promo, the promos were looking fantastic. The soundtrack was ruling my Ipod, so watching 'Prince' was a must for me! Kookie V. Gulati's 'Prince' is a film that works in bits and pieces. It has a terrific first hour, but the second hour struggles. However, It's amazing music, Camera-work, Action/Stunts and a superb performance by Vivek Oberoi makes this half-hearted fare a decent one-time watch.Here's something I want to say: Shiraz Ahmed's screenplay is watertight in the first hour. The suspense unfolds beautiful, it's keeps you at the Grip. But as soon the second hr beings, the screenplay becomes a mess. The climax, especially, is the weakest link. It leaves no impact whatsoever! A film that could've been a power-packed entertainer, sadly ends up becoming a strictly one-time watch, as mentioned from the beginning.Watch 'Prince' for the pluses it has. But be ready to come out half-hearted!" 
" it begins well and ends in stale","the movie is about a person called prince ( vive oberoi ) who has done a biggest heist in life and suddenly he wakes up to find that his memory is lost. such a person is been chased repeatedly by fake Maya ( neeru sing and nandana sen ) . the story takes a turn when real Maya ( aruna shields ) enters the movie. then the movie gets the slow side and the concept is all about a coin that has a memory chip which has been used for prince. now prince will die in 6 days slowly . can he survive and destroy the gangsters behind him. watch out for prince. cast wise performance : vive is suitable for the role. aruna is good as Maya. sanjay kapoor has done a neat role. Issiah is good as a villain. plus points : action scenessongsscenarios minus points : a different depth story that did"t make up to best.no much robbery scenes except the firstunnecessary roles of Maya"s. a drag a bit storyno indication of the stolen heist whereaboutsover all prince fails in proper execution of the story and ends in a predictable way with a different approach of climax using CGI"s . a good passable entertainer and can be watched once." 
" Review for the movie prince","OMG what can I say this is one of the best movies Bollywood has ever made, the way they used technology shows we can also create movies as good as Hollywood and I love this movie it's the best, the story, the gadgets, and even the actors it's really good and they should make a two and the people that didn't like it am sorry but you need to check your brain it's one of the best movies ever?the music was amazing and I'm running out of words to say, all I say is the script was well good , the acting, the actors, the music and everything there's not a single thing I didn't like, maybe some people didn't like it because they are use the old type of Indian movies not these high technological movies, even all Ma friends liked it and the younger generation like teenagers now all love this movie anyway good work keep it up ." 
" Please watch this, it's so bad that it's almost good","Okay, I went to the theater and watched this film. And now I am sure i wasted 2 hours of my life, and Rs. 40 of my pocket money. But to the readers who are viewing this review , I recommend to watch this movie. It's such a bad action thriller that it has become a good comedy. 3 Mayas and all the twist ( NOT IN THE PLOT BUT IN THEIR FIGURES :P ). Lots of skin, lots of guns, lots of bad acting, and scenes copied from films like Iron Man. Vivek Oberoi does a good job making look everything comic. Oh, few things more...they also tried to make it a sci-fi one. but i don't know how does a chip made with nanotechnology be visible with our naked eyes, and I also didn't know this fact that to delete something safely from a computers hard drive is to reboot it...whatever, Watch this movie and laugh like you haven't done it in a long time..." 
" Prince - a royal mess","Wasted a Saturday and 150 bucks on this. The only thing that sticks out of this movie are the action sequences. There is no story to begin with and with times it is clearly evident that the actions are as well mindless and in most places unneeded.There are a million plot holes but no need to pick those as after about 20 minutes in the film you will understand that the producers have only paid for the action sequences, the cast and the crews and no money has been given to the scriptwriter.If you really want to know the one paragraph plot then here it is -- Vivek Oberoi plays Prince, a supposedly high-profile thief, who has lost his memory. Everyone is after his life and in the process he knows that they are after a coin.Overall cinematography is good, but the acting is comical in a serious film. With such laughable and wooden acting it is hard for Vivek to even get a decent solo hit and rest of the star cast are there like stereotypes. Bad villains, Bond type female right-hand, useless Police...and the list goes on. So, spare the money, forget about this royal mess.3/10 - only for the needless actions and cinematography." 
" Prince, It's Snoozetime","Gulati's 'Prince' is pretty much another one of those horrible presents that are covered in beautiful giftwrap. It starts off with the title character stealing a coin (yes, of all things he steals a coin which is, as you'll see later, worth millions or whatever). Anyway, then he finds himself awake in his condo with no recollection of anything. Yup, he don't even remember his own name. A servant feeds his memory but that ain't enough. He goes to a nightclub and sees a hot slut performing an item number. She claims to be his girlfriend Maya. The morning after, he receives a phonecall from a seductress (Nandana Sen with overdone makeup), who also claims to be his girlfriend Maya. After some doubts and encounters, Prince is sure that seductress number two is the real Maya until it turns out that she's a 'chamchi' of a pathetic crackwhore kingpin and the truth is revealed that kingpin and chamchi orchestrated this in order to obtain the coin from Prince. Prince is then rescued by seductress number 3 (played by a newcomer whose name I don't know but she looks hot and cannot act). Now this number 3 also claims to be Maya. Who is the real Maya? Why does everyone want the coin? What's happened to Prince's memory. My proper answer would be: Who cares? But if you still want to waste precious time then just watch this horrendous movie which has very good special effects. The slow motions are quite retarded (as they almost always look in Bollywood movies). If the intention was to make a slick action movie why use slow motion at all? I really think Bollywood movies should avoid using slow motion. The camera-work is impressive and the songs are forgettable (some are downright horrible).Vivek Oberoi is adequate. His performance mainly suffers from bad writing. I can only imagine he did this film because he badly needed a hit and hopefully he got that so that now he can focus on doing meaningful cinema. The rest of the actors are downright bad. Nandana Sen is unintentionally funny.'Prince' is all gloss and no substance. Enough said." 
" A blank canvas with a stylish frame.","We have witnessed this numerous times before in Bollywood but the makers seem to be simply uninterested in learning from their previous mistakes. And here we are, once again served with a similar kind of project called "Prince", which surprisingly gives you nothing to write about apart from its stylish presentation and camera-work.As the movie started, it gave me the feeling that it's sure going to be another example of all gloss and no content. And the same was proved in its later reels when all the youngsters present in the theater were visibly looking as confused as Vivek Oberoi in the film. In short, nobody exactly knew that what was happening on the screen and why. And the two questions I had in mind while watching "Prince" were that "Is this, what they call entertainment for the masses? and "Was this the film, Vivek was banking upon to work wonders for his not so happening career?Truly speaking, no one in the film should feel that way as the project is seriously not capable of helping anyone involved in it. Right from the start, the movie has childishly executed sequences where the hero is stealing diamonds as if he is stealing candies from a display jar in a store. Bullets are being fired at him from every angle by the policemen without even thinking of injuring any trespassers. And on top of it, not even one touches our hero and he goes on to jump out of a multi storey building with a parachute tied at his back. Further, we are also forced to see him hanging from one building to another spinning a Spiderman kind of web as he is supposed to be well equipped with ultra modern gadgets developed by him in his own laboratory.The story has its main plot revolving around the memory loss of Vivek reminding you of Aamir's "Ghajini". The only difference is that here the memory is not lost due to any accident, but it is actually taken away or erased from the mind of Vivek, with the help of a newly invented chip. No doubt the action sequences and their execution is technically superb giving a Hollywood kind of look to the movie. But "Prince" should make one fact clear to Bollywood that you cannot win over the viewers with only technical excellence achieved in a project. The shining body of a movie can only get you some instant eye balls at the start, but if you want to have more foot fall in the theaters later on, then you got to work on the main content, storyline and script of the movie. It is completely impossible to fool the audiences by only showing excellent graphic touches on the screen, shot on exotic foreign locations along with beautiful ladies in revealing outfits and then expecting a huge hit out of it."Prince" exactly tries the same and falls flat on ground in absence of an engrossing and thrilling screenplay. As suggested by its promotional campaign, the movie was expected to be high on technical grounds but relying entirely on its execution was like taking the viewers for granted. The screenplay even comes out to be pretty hilarious at times when the three ladies come by their own turn and introduce themselves to Vivek (who has lost his memory) as "Maya". Later they simply transform into the routine glamour dolls of Hindi Cinema, who are there only to sing songs and provide the relief element to the viewers.Director Kookie Gulati, who was earlier famous for his lavish music videos, has surely got the right vision as what would look nice on the screen, but he falters greatly in his writing department which turns out to be the main weakness of his prestigious project. He starts off promisingly with a heist sequence (inspired from Hollywood of course) but then fails to hold the viewer's attention in the second half. However it was really surprising that the movie was written by Shiraz Ahmed of "Race" fame. If this is the result of trying to be original, then he should better continue copying some lesser known world movies as he did in "Race". In the Music department, Sachin Gupta tries to cash on the Atif craze by roping him in as the lead singer of his main songs. The soundtrack is not anything above the routine with only one marginally good song which is now being used for its T.V. promotion.Vivek Oberoi tries to look tough and even gives you the signs of an extremely over confident personality. He is excellent in his stunts but sadly all the fight visuals in the movie appear to be fake and hugely exaggerated. Frankly speaking, Vivek will have to wait for RGVs "Raktcharitra" to do something for him in his career as "Prince" would not be able to prove the much desired jump board for him. In the female lead, Nandana Sen looks stunning but is wasted in an unimportant role of a vamp. Neeru is just there to fill up the space and Aruna gets the major attraction only in the second half. Both Sanjay Kapoor & Dalip Tahil play their routine kind of roles effectively. The only worth mentioning merit of the movie remains its Cinematography by Vishnu Rao, who presents himself as a DOP at par with the professionals working in the West. In fact, it's his top notch camera angles, lighting and placements which keep you seated till the end. Otherwise, the movie is just like a white blank canvas with a stylish and expensive frame. It can also be referred as the cheap Chinese Version of the famous Bond movies. So, you can easily take this out of your weekend plans." 
" Somewhere there is a great movie hidden in Prince!","There is a lot in Prince that could have worked much better. The plot of course is pure science fiction. And this isn't a bad thing. Actually it had the potential to make Prince into a well made thriller. Only somehow the writers couldn't get past the clichés you have seen over and over again in other similar movies. I have no problems with style over substance. But this movie has too much of the wrong style with no substance at all. Too much flash can ruin scenes and Prince is a good example of how not to do it. The biggest problem however I had were the badly executed action scenes. When a plot doesn't hold up there has to be something else to elevate a production. Whether it is comedy or action. (I am not mentioning drama and it should be obvious why). Since every actor took this movie way too serious there was no chance of genuine laughs whatsoever). So we are left with action. Oh my god the action. And I don't mind ridiculous stunts like the one with the motorcycle on the walking bridge. As long as it looks good. Say what you want about the stunts in James Bond movies. They were always over the top but still impressed the viewer since it looked believable. And this is not the case in any action scene of Prince. Most of it looked fake. So what is left there too enjoy. Well,there were these beautiful women. But they only can hold your interest for so long." 
" Decent despite tacky techniques of 70s diamond robbery films; fantastic music","The movie is not as great as I expected it to be. A lot of the "thrills", stunts, etc. seemed forced, irrelevant, and tacky--quite reminiscent of the diamond heist films of the 70s. International dons hiding out in never-ending underground layers, massive lineup of useless bodyguards, a hero with an awkward smirk who always thinks he's acting in slow motion, and random futuristic technology are just some of the trademarks of those films that you will re-encounter.The second half is better than the first as the plot develops more. Vivek fails to impress. He suits guy-next-door roles such as in Company, Saathiya, and Yuva as oppose to superhero flicks like Kisna and Prince. The débutant actresses were more eye candy than anything else. The computer graphics seemed quite artificial. Despite all its weaknesses, the movie is a half-decent entertainer with slick visuals, foreign locales, nice action sequences, interesting sci-fi technology, great eye candy, and cool cars. However the best part of the film is undoubtedly the music. Great lyrics combined with power-packed performances by Atif Aslam make the soundtrack addictive--catchy songs with immense depth. Music videos are terrific as well." 
" Poor","Very poor movie only watch it because my brother like all the movie songs.. well it starts promising.. and after starting 30 or 20 minutes it get worse!! i mean when he lost his memory as everyone know he don't know who is he? and all that look so fake and the fighting scene that y0u can watch in trailers was so so fake i mean wtf you forget everything but you remember how you fight well i don't know about your taste reader may be you should watch and find out yourself is the movie watchable or avoidable and yeah if you are bored and got nothing to do then may be this one is good for you to pass your time.. finding out who price really is :P Lolx" 
" one of the worst movie of all time(after do knot disturb)","first i was so confident that this movie would be bad, but after seeing vivek's and director's interview and i thought let's give it a try but movie is so bad that i got headache and i went out of theater but i said to my self that the writer of this film had also written race and i was expecting some twists in second half but there is nothing in the film.vivek oberoi is a good actor he has done films like company, road, shootout at lokhandwala ;but in this movie everyone have done bad acting and the overall script was so weak that stars like amitabh bacchan and akhay kumar couldn't have made this film a hit. it's a complete disaster . could have been better but not. i am giving 2 points only for songs." 
" tries hard and fails","Vivek Oberoi is one actor whose career started at an all time high(Company, Saathiya) but went downhill soon after, reason being partly his contrioversy(fight with salman) and his choice of films. Prince is yet another of his bad decisions he made. Prince looks slick, also the promos on air(mostly Atif's songs) caught attention but never judge a book by it's cover. The problem with the film is that it holds your attention well especially in the first half but then goes downhill. The track of a microchip replacing one's memory is hard to digest and could be treated better Also the end when Vivek finds out the location of the villain through a chip, Also Vivek Oberoi casting webs make one wonder whether he is a superheroDirection by Kookie Gulati could be better Music was the selling point, Atif Aslam's Tere Liye being the best one though it's placement could be properVivek Oberoi plays his part well, at times his effort is evident he is a decent actor if chooses right scripts Nandana Sen being the only actress who is known, does well The other two, Aruna Sheilds(with a dubbed voice) is awful Neeru Bajwa is decent Sanjay Kapoor is good in his role, Dalip Tahil is okay South actor Isaiah with a dubbed voice is nothing great rest are okay"

" Perfect Entertainer With A Huge Repeat Value","Prince satiates the Indian audiences' need for an action science-fiction thriller with spectacular stunts and technology. It is about a suave and stylish thief aptly named Prince. He wakes up one day with a blank mind at his beachside house. Then starts the adventure of Prince towards discovering who he is and why people are behind him.Coming to the structure of the film, it has more than enough substance in the form of action sequences as well as songs. Twists are placed suitably and you get to feel enthralled when watching the story on screen. One thing should be said - the film might feel incomplete at some places - but that does not outright disturb the viewing experience. You will never get bored while watching this film.Performance of every actor is splendid. Vivek Oberoi lives in the character of Prince and he has showcased all emotions ranging from vulnerability to confidence very well throughout the film. It is a treat to watch him execute his plans. The 3 heroines have done their job nicely. Sanjay Kapoor, Isaiah, Dalip Tahil have portrayed their characters very well and deserve special mention. The movie has high standards of believable unbelievability and handles such things well.The film boasts of a sound technical team. Vishnu Rao's cinematography has captured the mood of the film very efficiently - there are beautiful shots during action sequences, and the tropical colour tones used in outdoor shooting is pleasing to the eye. Visual effects are splendid as per 2010 standards. This film has the potential to capture the attention of the youth and teenagers because of its catchy songs. Each song is a gem and it must be said that such a strong soundtrack with a perfect entertainer is a rare combination. Background music of the film coupled with the sound design compose one of the best audio outputs that have never been heard before. Editing is apt and the complex action shots have been handled well. Length of the film is completely justified.The only negatives we can see are that a few characters are not given ample extension i.e. they could have been given more scenes. Serena and PK are two such characters. Also, the film carries a sort-of dated look that might not go down well with some people.It is sad that we had not been able to appreciate this film at the time of its release. Such entertainers are very rare in Hindi cinema. Do not miss it on TV as it needs just a receptive mind to feel the movie. And who knows, you may become a fan of Prince as well as Vivek Oberoi. Highly recommended (even for repeat watching)."
