" Very interesting and funny, one of the best comedy films in Bollywood","Dhamaal is an amazing and very funny story of four ordinary university dropouts and unemployed men formed their own group of con artists, carrying out theft and other illegal activities to get money. It's truly crazy and a laughing riot. With Director Indra Kumar weaving in new characters, unexpected plots and twists and turns, making it truly come ducal and putting a smile on the faces of the audience although some parts including the plot of the film are based on Rat Race, It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and Mr. Bean (the British TV Series and it's feature film in 1997). However, the ending of the film where the 6 men arrive at a Help Orphan Children Organization charity, the comedy is drained out but Director Kumar manages to refill the gaps with comedy when Kabir is interrogated by his boss again and the end song and dance as the credits roll. Watch this if you are feeling lonely, bored or down. As the name suggests, the film does do it's best to make you laugh. It did truly tickle my funny bone and drew a smile on me several times. Basically, this is what a comedy/drama film is meant to be! Arshad, Aashish, Ritesh and Javed truly shine as these four lovable and funny idiots with Sanjay Dutt and Asrani doing a spectacular performance, playing tough and strict but still funny men." 
" Nice surprise","The movie has really come out as a nice surprise. I watched it expecting it to be very stupid and rubbish comedy like 'Dhol' or 'Tom. Dick and Harry'. I even was not having any intention of watching this movie, as I know what to expect from such movies. My roommate bought this movie and then I watched it with him. And we both like it. In fact we were both rofling while watching and saying, "Kya Bakwaas Chal Raha Hain".We were involved so much that only at the last scene we realized that the movie theme is copied from rat race. I again watched the movie after one month back at my home.Yes, the movie is full of stupid unrealistic scenarios and characters. The movie is also copied from not one but multiple Hollywood films. But the touch that they have given from Indian audience and the decent acting from lead characters made this movie worth watching. Even though all the jokes are very old age, due to the way they are presented and the way they occur we want to laugh at them.When the movie has many characters normally we see that character building itself takes a lot of time and then each character did not get enough scope on screen. But fortunately in this movie each one gets its share time to develop and present themselves. Due to this there is restriction on scope of each character and hence the actors doing those do not have any problems performing them. That is why even without any big names behind (except Sanjay Dutt) the movie has done some good at box office.The movie is flows with constant pace. Nowhere we find it going slow (except for the plane scene may be) or going fast. Also absence of songs I will treat as a positive point.The other important aspect is not having any female actor. In todays Bollywood era, where an item song is a must in a movie doing such a daring is admirable.This is the kind of you will like to watch and forget, but if you get another chance you will watch it again. At least I will." 
" Entertaining, but not an original work.","Dhamaal is an entertaining movie. However, one can't shake off the fact that the movies LIFTS scenes and story lines from AROUND 5-6 Hollywood MOVIES, right from the first scene.First scene is a rip-off of Johnny English, the third scene is copied from one of Mr.Bean's episodes. The whole damn storyline is EXACTLY IDENTICAL to 'Its a Mad Mad World' and 'Rat Race'. Later one, the movie lifts the bridge scene from 'Road Trip', the tiger roar scene is from a movie called Without A Paddle, and the whole soap gun scene is from 'Small Time Crooks'. On many occasions, it is also inspired by Starsky and Hutch.UPDATE - Just watched 'Dude, Wheres my car?' and the pizza scene is copied directly from there.However, the second half is where we see some originality, and ironically, the most original scenes are the most entertaining. The movie goes for a clich√©d ending, however, which is a downer.THE GOOD Great performances from the cast, especially Arshad Warsi, Ritesh, and Jaffrey. Some very entertaining original parts, especially in the second half.THE BAD You won't have much fun if you have watched the above-mentioned movies. Some jokes, like the airplane one and the cliffhanging one, are stretched to a point where they are not funny anymore. Not so great music. Disappointing ending.Overall, Dhamaal is a decent entertainer, but stumbles badly on originality, as the copied jokes have been done much better in the original movies." 
" One of the best comedies","Inder Kumar's Dhamaal,is on of the cleanest and funniest movies to come out in Bollywood.Nowadays,we hardly get to see squeaky clean comedy movies.Dhamaal is a little gem which deserves a watch.This movie was not promoted heavily but soon gain popularity among people and became a super hit at box-office.Direction by Inder Kumar is very good.Dialogs are very good.Performance wise-Javed Jaffery tops with an enthralling performance.Ritesh Deshmukh is very good.Ditto for Arshad Warsi and Ashish Chaudhary.Sanjay Dutt too is excellent.Asrani and Sanjay Mishra are hilarious.Prem Chopra is good in a brief role.Overall Dhamaal deserves more than once viewing because it is one of those comedies which we hardly get." 
" Excellent Comedy","After months and months of flops being released, this is one movie that has lived by its title, "Dhamaal," which means chaos, trouble.Three men, Aditya Shrivastav, Manav Shrivastav and Deshbandhu Roy are thrown out of their rented house after failing to pay rent for several months and find themselves homeless as they are not employed. They try to survive by stealing portraits but even this fails and they get caught and are soon joined by their friend, Boman Contractor, who like them, has no job and has left home. However, his father, is wealthy but only cares about his antique car. Boman decides to go against his father's wishes and steals the car and the four of them head towards Goa. Enroute the collide with another car, whose driver dies but not before informing them about some hidden money. Unknown to the four men, a certain Police Inspector Kabir Nayak has been chasing the dead man and Boman Contractor's father has found out that his beloved antique car has been stolen by his son.The movie stars Sanjay Dutt, Arshad Warsi (both of them known for their roles in "Munnabhai M.B.B.S" and "Laage Raho Munnabhai"), Riteish Deshmukh, Ashish Choudhary and Asrani. A special appearance is made by the legendary villain, Prem Chopra. The movie has no female actress accept for one, who make a brief appearance at the beginning as the landlady. The director, Indra Kumar, has done an excellent job of this out and out comedy movie and is worthwhile watching it with your family.Does anyone remember the movie, "Its A Mad Mad World?"" 
" A Real Comedy","This movie is the perfect example of what is comedy. And a movie can be a hit and does good business without women too. The story line is same and old one. 4 friends Roy, Adi, Manav and Boman, lives together share good and funny moments. Their jokes are hilarious. Though Sanjay Dutt is also there in the movie, but the young boys does a good job, and make this movie a perfect comedy, this is a type of movie which you can see again and again, A complete funny entertainer. These four friends going from Bombay to Goa for some money, but when money words comes, there is no place for any other thing. This happen with these friends too. All friendship breaks bcoz they are not be able to decide what is the share they have to distribute. Lots and lots of characters are coming at regular intervals and joins them in their journey. This movie is as comedy as I can compare this with Hera Pheri and Golmaal. There's not a single moment in the movie where you say that you are not enjoying. All characters is superb and specially our Adi(Arshad) and Manav(Javed). After Dil, Beta, Mann and Masti, Inder Kumar's this flick proves that he is a king of comedy." 
" Felt cheated..a bit","Yes, cheated, especially when i reached the IInd half and realised all the gags were copied from 'Rat Race'(2001) with slight changes to cater to the desi crowd. Sanjay Dutt doing the bus driver routine (aka Cuba Gooding Jr.), Ashish Choudhary & Asrani in the plane (aka Amy Smart and Breckin Meyer in the chopper) and the final showdown where the large crowd gapes at them, the hot air balloon and even the digital display of the total donation amount!! I have stopped expecting originality after the 'jaane bhi do yaaro' days and am being probably a bit too harsh in saying that but I cannot help it as the Hollywood movie scripts copied shamelessly over (well the ones that can be, that is) are usually the movies that i have already seen. Hence, since last month, i have taken a break and have started watching Korean movies instead..that is till they run out of Hollywood scripts to photocopy. That said, a few gags in Dhamaal (choohon ka race?) does manage to bring a smile on your face and the effort deserves a 7. Watchable with friends who don't mind slapstick, goofy and over the top comedy capers." 
" It's a mad mad mad mad Rat Race...","Well, the title of the comment is good enough to suggest what i am referencing to. It's a 40% copy of "It's a mad mad mad mad world", 15% of "Rat Race", 5% of others (like Mr.bean). Rest 40% is original, i guess.Enough of Segregation.. Now, coming to movie. After see(tolerate)ing movies like Partner and Heyy Babyy, this one comes as some serious refreshment.Though copied, movie has some nice comic sequences of its own. Best part, i believe was that none of the actors overacted and performed their acts quite well. Javed Jaffrey stands out as the best of the lot. His performance, similar to the character "Blaine Cody" of "Rat Race", was brilliant. Vijay Raz's sequence as tower controller was the best moment i guess.Aashish Chowdhry has improved a lot. Ritesh performs well. Sanjay Dutt is just OK and cameos by some TV artists are good as well.For the shortcomings.. Arshad Warsi disappoints after a long time. His performance wasn't up to the mark here.Another bad thing is that some scenes are xerox copy of the originals. Bollywood needs to trust its capability. More Indians now watch English movies than ten years back and copying scenes now could backfire. No matter how good a movie is, people are still gonna blame you for copying. Moreover, there's a danger of lawsuits being filed which can be a big shame for Indian cinema.Anyways, the movie was highly watchable. so it gets 6/10 from me." 
" Laugh Heartily for 135min....","This is complete paisa vasool film.... U can heartily laugh for 2hr 15min... Don't see logic n all, just sit down n relax... It has a simple story line... 4 guys who are not at all serious in life, meets a dying gangster who tells them bout 10cr he has made in life... n tells them to use it as they like... but a inspector comes n enquires them bout it as he is investigating the root of that very money for 10 yrs ... then the conflict starts b/w them as to who as to get the money... everyone leaves to Goa where money is supposedly hidden... The climax is beautifully planned... n i'll not spoil it... Actin is wonderful... music by sandeep is good... wonderful direction by Indra kumar...." 
" Very Entertaining BUT for 2 big BUT's......","Indra Kumar may never have made cinematic masterpieces but has always delivered good stellar, albeit very inspired entertainment.However something made me feel that this movie may in fact not be inspired, because buffoonery a staple of Bollywood comedies since the 90's, is in fact "Very 90's and before that Very 60's" in Hollywood, there there have been the odd movie of this genre in recent years but those have all been copied thanks to one great man Mr. Neeraj Vohra(in partnership with Priyadarshan off course), I cant wait to see which movies hes plundered in his latest venture.BUT the fact is I hoped and felt this movie was original, BUT for a long time since i can remember I WAS WRONG.So wrong in fact that 15 mins into this movie i knew almost exactly the movies the major jokes in this movie, THIS MOVIE FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES IS A PERFECT MIXTURE OF 2 MOVIES ITS A MAD MAD MAD WORLD (1963) AND RAT RACE(2001), the STORY MORE FROM ITS A MAD.. WHILE SOME OF THE CHARACTERS AND SEQUENCES ARE FROM RAT RACE probably because entire sequences have been lifted from its A Mad... by Neeraj Vohra in the past (Bhagam Bhag), and they needed enough content to fill in the spaces.When i realised this i started the normal routine of lamenting my fate, and the quality of the Hindi movie industry,(HEHE screw driver up the bums so funny), when were we ever going to have an original movie here, is it my fault that I've seen so many good English movies,(the stereotypical Bawa who loves his old car haha) THEY EVEN IMPRESSED ME BY HAVING VERY FEW DIALOGUES IN English AND HAVING THE STARTING CREDITS IN Hindi, don't tell me they've copied the scene down to the kick the bucket joke, how many people who speak even English know that (Ritiesh Deshmukh is hilarious hehhoohoho), blah blah blah.....THEN THE OTHER BUT HIT ME......BUT....EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR GAGS IM STILL LAUGHIN Aren't I.Somewhere along the line in the attempt at Indianizing the story and the script, this movie added something new to otherwise predictable blend, much like what we Indians did to Chinese food, its like to take Chinese recipes of Manchurian and noodles, cook it Indian style add masala and what not, then when you mix the two it doesn't merely taste like Manchurian plus noodles but something else.And so i laughed, and laughed and laughed, the JOKES ARE VERY VERYT CHILDISH mind you and if you don't have the appetite for childish humour then this movie is not for you, a bunch of us friends loved it, but when my parents went for this movie despite me warning them in advance they found the movie toooo childish.The acting is superb, everyone has put really fine inspired performances, again with an Indian twist to everything, SANJAY DUTT WAS COMPLETELY OFF COLOUR, (maybe his impending jail stint had something to do with it, and GOD WILLING THE LAW WILL PREVAIL AND HE SHALL SOON BE BACK THERE AGAIN).Still his bad performance was very very noticeable and a slight dampener.AFTER CASH AND HEY BABY RITIESH HAS GAINED BACK SOME RESPECT.THE SONGS WERE CRAP TO PUT IT MILDLY AND BADLY USED WITH 2 OF THEM IN QUICK SUCCESSION IN THE BEGINNING.Luckily thanks to large amount of content (the original IAMMMMW was 3 hrs and RR was 2 hours) there were no more songs in this film.Technically this movie was OK with some special effects and sound effect used effectively, writing directing was OK given the fact that this movie was completely inspired.By the end of it this turned out to be a very entertaining movie for me despite its huge shortcomings.ONCE AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO WARN YOU THAT THIS MOVIE Isn't FOR EVERYBODY, its very childish (not a single adult joke), everyone is a buffoon, AS PROMISED there is no romantic track etc etc. Its utter and complete stupidity and if thats not your taste then this movie is not for you.If however you do like such movies, haven't seen the originals, or are willing to overlook its blatant plagiarism, THEN GO AHEAD AUR KAR LO DHAMAAL.-s blatant plagiarism, some jokes to stupid to be funny, pathetic songs.+/-s the interval was needed for me (its not easy seeing so much stupidity at one go), SANJAY DUTT (I KNOW HE MADE A MISTAKE BUT WHEN YOU MAKE MISTAKES Aren't YOU SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR THEM).+S great inspired acting all around, good technically (again credit to the originals), lots of hilarious jokes some with a very Indian soul.total 6/10 (any movie thats so blatantly copied deserves no better, i really enjoyed myself but i assure you it wont be the same for everyone, despite the fact that i enjoyed i still pray and hope for something original to come out of bollywood)." 
" A good laugh-out-loud comedy after a hectic day!","Hey i had a hectic past month and then when i was free today, i thought I had earned the right to chill out with my friends, so I caught the noon show of Dhamaal.Well, how was it? From the word go, the director gets into the thick of the action. Short 'n sweet introduction of all the characters is done. And before you know it, you're on a hell of a roller-coaster fun ride. Some scenes left us all shaking with laughter, like the one in which Arshad 'calculates' the velocity of his car and the angle of projection and then throws a stone to check it, or when Riteish falls right into a luxury coach, which as luck would have it, was being hijacked, or the one in which Vijay Raaz talks about patience and going slow and later learns a lesson. All the actors, especially the trio of Javed Jaffery, Riteish and Arshad Warsi show impeccable timing. Maybe I enjoyed it more because I was with my friends, but believe me, it's good to see such a non-stop laugh riot once in a while, however non-sensical!(Deshmukh makes, rather, crafts a gun and frees himself without the carjackers noticing, Sanjay Dutt jumps off the cliff and grabs the two falling children. Simply preposterous!). I'd suggest you go for it, and you'll enjoy yourself thoroughly, it's the best bollywood comedy this year has produced. Then the talk about this being a rip-off of 'Its a MAD MAD MAD MAD World'and even having scenes from Mr.Bean(the washroom scene in the beginning) and Starsky&Hutch. But hey, as long as they've SUCCEEDED in this rip-off using our desi comic actors, and provided paisa-vasool entertainment,so as to say, then what's the harm?? Go watch it and you're guaranteed, it'll make you laugh!!" 
" Bollywood's Mad Mad Mad World !","Since a great cinematic action comedy named (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World) was made in (1963) the world had gone real mad about it.There is almost a version every decade. American different treatments like (Scavenger Hunt) in (1979), (Million Dollar Mystery) in (1987), an Egyptian one (Maganeen ala El-Tareek) in (1991), an American remake (Rat Race) in (2001), then ‚Äì in the same decade ‚Äì why not an Indian one too (Dhamaal ‚Äì 2007).(Dhamaal) is simply an explicit remake of (Rat Race ‚Äì 2001) yet with slight touches from the original (Mad..) and even slighter Indian touches as well!It's a nice comedy. So colorful but so painful in the same time since it assures the insolvency of the Indian cinema with countless stolen scripts yearly and mainly from the American cinema (I don't believe that "Paritosh Painter" is the writer of Dhamaal's story as the credits said !). Sanjay Dutt looked lovable in this. In fact the whole cast looked the same. But the movie itself can be that if only you didn't watch its American original movies first.It's a crisis of not too many new ideas, hitting the entire world including the American cinema by the way. You can feel it with the more commercial production of many cinemas. ..Though, I'm just asking: when will it be for the American cinema to remake Indian movies ?! And I'm not blaming the Americans if you know what I mean!" 
" Money , money, money ,it's a poor man's world !","Recently , we had a number of comedies based on the passion to possess lots of money ,and the subsequent pursuit of the lofty goal, the mad runners coming from the lower middle class , or even rural community. Apna Sapna Money Money , Malamal Weekly etc. Dhamaal also revolves around not less than 10 crores , lustily eyed by a group of assorted people , and a smart inspector , even the Commissioner ! The casting of the movie is good , with Arshad Warsi , Javed Jafferey , and old -time veterans like Asrani in cameo roles to support. The plot has been thoughtfully written , to create farcical situations , some of the innovative being the idea of Adi to sell paintings to the sons of the deceased . Ritesh Deshmukh has given a very natural performance , and his scene with the monkey in the jungle , or faking a gun made from the soap , to scare the dacoits , are hilarious . Sanjay Dutt is surprisingly at ease , and looks fresher than he otherwise looks . A considerable amount of effort has obviously gone into the stunts , and they help to add to an otherwise predictable plot , and reduce the monotony of the string of events , by pumping excitement into the situations . Their ride through the mountains is also pleasing to the eyes . i remembered a scene from Mr. Bean's Holiday , when he gets locked up in a roadside loo , and also gets entangled with a young boy , who is left behind on the platform. The twist to the situation , when they have to part with their prized booty , after going through so much of agony and calamities , is a real feather in the cap of the script writer . i found it very appropriate , that especially the jobless and the mediocre youth willingly give up the money. Normally , the money either goes down the drain , or flies in the air , or the characters are after each other with fatal gun shots . This is how we could discreetly influence our young ones ,that values are more important than the pieces of paper , that is cash . However , the movie needed a little touch of editing , especially for the constant slapping of Asrani , and their flight in the plane , going on and on ! Vinay Apte's south Indian , repeating his never ending name , and Arshad going crazy over it , are quite original. The heroine in this movie was the money , and the hot pursuit proved to be more exciting , by Men Only this time for a change ! Musical score and the dance numbers , are suitable to the plot line , and performed in style , included moderately , to protect the tempo of the string of events . one would certainly look forward to watch such comedies , which are not failed attempts to create humor , but well-thought out , pure entertainment . Keep it up !" 
" LoL.","Evergreen fun and laugh. No one can stop to laugh even you watch film 100 times. Lol." 
" Nice comedy movie","Nice storyline good screenplay good everything This was a hundred percent entertaining I really liked the film a lot it Sanjay dutt was amazing ritesh is awesome arshad was brilliant other were funny Songs are really impressive but it's really mesmerizing as well just being honest My own rating of the movie is 8/10 or 4/5 stars" 
" Truly Hilarious!","'Dhamaal' is a mad, zany, silly but truly hilarious comedy film, that hasn't lost its touch even after nearly a decade since its release. I have seen this cult-classic many times & the film only gets funnier each time I re-watch it. 'Dhamaal' Synopsis: Four good-for-nothing companions & a corrupt cop embark on a journey to find a hidden treasure in Goa. Heavily inspired by the all-time hit It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, 'Dhamaal' offers genuine laughs & tickles your funny bone all through. The characters & their journey as one, is definitely silly, but the sequences are so hilarious, that you are on the floor laughing! The gags, one after the other, are so funnily written, that its impossible not to laugh. Bunty Rathod's Screenplay borrows heavily from the above-mentioned film, but it works entirely. A special mention for the crackling dialogue. Indra Kumar's Direction is good. He deserves kudos for not letting the pace drop at any given time. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Music by Adnan Sami is excellent.'Dhamaal' works because of its terrific casting. Arshad Warsi, Riteish Deshmukh, Aashish Chaudhary & Jaaved Jaffrey are a riot! Their on-screen chemistry as well as their comic timing, is masterful. Jaffrey, especially, is top-notch. Sanjay Dutt is his usual self. Asrani brings the house down. He's another topper! Vijay Raaz, Suhasini Mulay, Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Pahwa & The Late/Great Vinay Apte are superb in bit roles. On the whole, Wanna laugh-out-loud? Watch 'Dhamaal'. Its pure fun!"
