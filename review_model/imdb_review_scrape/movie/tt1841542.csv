" Special !","CHILLAR PARTY is not just for kids, but for grownups as well. A story of grit and determination, it works not just as an entertainer, but also advocates a message rather strongly. A film that deserves to be tax-exempted so that it reaches out to a wider audience. A small film with a gigantic spirit... Encourage this one!Every kid in the film pitches in a winning performance - Jhangiya enacted by Naman, Shaolin Divij, Enclyclopedia Sanath, Silencer Vedant, Aflatoon Aarav, Panauti Chinmay, Toothpaste Sherya, Akram Rohan, Second Hand Visshesh and Fatka Irfan Khan. It would be unfair and unjust to single out just one of them. As a matter of fact, you just can't help but fall in love with each of them. Ditto for the supporting actors, who enact the role of the parents and also the conniving politician." 
" Innocent and Admirable","No pretensions, no melodrama, no gimmicks but just plain honest movie making. Fresh artists, relatively new filmmakers and a simple script. If all those 'big Bollywood movies' refrain from complicating their sub-avg story-lines, some of the craziest films could actually become watchable.Delhi Belly & Chillar Party - 2 decent movies releasing within a span of two weeks. That has got to be a record of sorts for the Hindi Industry. Among the hundreds of movies they throw at us every year, only a handful are worth our money & time, and I can assure you - Chillar Party (2011) is one of them.What makes me wonder is - how a bunch of school kids can emote so well and deliver their lines with such conviction. There are many other movies other than Chillar Party where children have done a splendid job. Mainstream actors who call themselves "professionals" and "adults" who bomb on a regular basis should watch and learn. Comedy is top-notch and the screenplay fits the script like a glove. Most of the scenes will evoke a smile or a laugh and you wont mind a tiny bit when the movie sometimes teeters on the edge of childishness. I mean, for Gods' sake, the lead actors are kids, how else can you expect it to play out ? It will remind us of our own childhood and bring back fond memories. But, importantly, the aim of the movie is not to move us emotionally or make us nostalgic, but to tell us in a subtle way that honesty & simplicity are the most cherished qualities a human being can have. Those are qualities we all had back when we were at school, but now our adulthood and the society we live in, has changed our sense or perception." 
" A children's movie..not only for children...","You are much mistaken if you decide not to watch this movie because it is supposedly a children's movie. This movie does what many mainstream movie fail to do. Connect with the audience. It has a simple story but is so brilliantly treated that it becomes a delight to watch it. Everyone of the child artists has done a great job with a special mention for "Jangiya". Dialogue are witty and cute at the same time. Movie starts with a simple dislike, turns into a friendship story and ends into a full blown protest to save the silent hero, Bhidu the dog. Movie also conducts one of the best climax I have seen lately. In short, a must watch for everyone who has ever thought of or been a part of one or other "Chillar Party"" 
" Superb Movie 9.75/10","Hi frns, This is a superb story which is presented superbly :). May be Title doesn't excites u, or seems likely to be a KID Movie, but don't dare to think like that, One of those movies where u can learn and Laugh both.Want to take an inspiration, or just to laugh, choice is yours. The movie is exceptionally well. I am surprised Salman KHAN production produced this kind of Movie while we don't see this kind of stuff from him anytime.Thanks for getting this movie and it was a pleasure to watch such Kids doing something which Meaningfull. I see our countrymen awakening. :) Carry on MOVIEBUFFS. WATCH this and STORE it into your collection." 
" Story of Indian Childhood and Slumhood","Wow what a movies this year ..........first "Stanley k dabba" rocks and now this time "chiller party"......brilliantly directed.......and a story telling movie......but why this kind of movies not getting enough audience....i don't know where is the taste of Indian audience is changing over.......But what a movie it should be shown to Hollywood....and promoted to Oscars .....each and every character in the movie gave his/her best specially the members of chiller party....it is the compulsion for parents to watch this movie as well as there children's too...Last but not the least this movie rocks ended with a great theme and motivation to the children.the music is so improvised.some kind of dissolving soundtracks .....which provides u childhood adventure ......" 
" Best of many recent movies","No wonder there are very few reviews for this movies. When I had heard of this movie, I had liked it's idea. apart from story build-up, and awesome acting, this movie carry few important messages for all of us. The most important, nothing is impossible; most of us think of outcome before even trying to fight for something. This is the reason probably because of which India is run by crazy, money thirsty politician who care for just power and money, India comes no where. This holds true in many other situations. Second, Children are truly future of a nation, they should be given freedom of thought. about acting, No one can act better than children, They are natural actors, this movie is a true example." 
" One of the best movies in recent times",""One of the best movies in recent times" - This statement may seem biased if you haven't seen this movie. It's always a daunting task for movie makers to weave a story around a long list of characters and ensure that everybody get an equal focus. This movie is a perfect example of such wizardry. The story is about a bunch of society children who fight to save a dog. But, the manner in which the story has been knit and portrayed is commendable.Every child in this movie has a distinct character. You will be able to co-relate each one with friends around you when you were children. It's not worth if you get to know the story of this movie from others because if you don't see it, you won't know what you are missing. A perfect weekend watch for your family.This movie doesn't fail to pass several messages for the children as well as the adults. A special mention for 'Jhangiya' who is an absolute delight to watch." 
" Very nice movie, good message !!! Must watch ...","This is another movie of "Taare Zamein Par" category with very good story, dialogs and message. This is what Youth need in India. My family Loved it ... I already have stacked Taare zamein Par, 3 Idiots and now this is again good. I happened to accidentally come across this in Netflix and we watched it ... This movie is a must watch when you are kids, or if you like inspirational + sentimental + comedy ... 10 points for the director. This movie should be shown in school to kids to change the way they think and to be more confident and do things in good cause. For a change main actors are kids and they have done wonderful job. Make a Sequel if Director can read this ..." 
" Wonderful Little Gem","I didn't have much expectation when I went to see the film. But, this was surprisingly good & refreshing movie. I can easily say, it is better than many contemporary multi-starrer movies.Kids have acted brilliantly in this films. Most of the kids were totally unseen, I mean they have no acting experience, not even in the advertisements. So, two thumbs up for the kids.But, the best thing about the film is the cudgel that the kids take up for a cause against a politician. Funnily, politician has shown no shame fighting with the small kids, just to gratify his ego. Rightfully depicted in the movie.So, kudos to Salman Khan for giving this wonderful little gem." 
" Watch it with your kids at the earliest and have a good time.","Our Bollywood and its viewers work in a strange manner. Here at one end, a film full of abuses and highly objectionable dialogues (Delhi Belly) is appreciated by the audience like a great idea and on the other an enjoyable & meaningful children film endorsed by Salman Khan himself, doesn't become the first option of the viewers on its release. In fact, it was really a great gesture by Salman to come forward in support of the film in such a way. But even that wasn't sufficient in influencing the viewers to go for CHILLAR PARTY. May be they would have been interested only if Salman was featuring in the film.Anyway, in this whole process, the kids remained at the losing end as their parents didn't feel like taking them for the film which in reality was a must-take lesson for them too. Here I would also like to blame the publicity campaign of the film which wrongly focused more on the naked kids in their under-wears and less on the Dog, who is the main subject of its storyline. If you see its posters again then the Dog gets lost in the 8 kids and one cannot get an idea that the film has something to do with it. So, I strongly feel that had the promos and posters focused more on the Kids relationship with the Dog, it would have got more audience.As of now CHILLAR PARTY remains a film, which though is not an outstanding one, but still has many enjoyable moments and a message too for the grown-ups, which in the end converts it into a must watch flick for all the families having kids in this particular age group. It's a story of a gang of kids living together in a society and their sweet & sour relationship with a street kid and his dog. The first hour of the film is not that great till the kids are having their mutual conflicts with the new entrants. And the film actually starts when they all become together and get a cause to fight for it with their full force.The moment the war starts within the kids and the Politician backed by few people of their own society, the film gets into its fourth gear. And then the fifth gear comes in the last T.V. interview sequence which teaches a new lesson to every grown up watching it casually. Actually it's the final hour of the film which transforms it into a worth watching experience and in between the comic scenes maintain the tempo perfectly. Particularly the sequence when the kids start speaking the street language and the scenes with their friend having an unusual voice.The director duo Nitesh Tiwari and Vikas Bahl keep the flow of the film going and then they really excel in its second half. Getting such honest and impressive performance from a group of kids is not an easy job. So, they deserve full marks for their mutual effort which works really well. However I felt that the soundtrack and its placement could have been better as required by a children film.Nevertheless, CHILLAR PARTY gives us two important messages for a better social living. Firstly it loudly declares that in the minds of our future generations, class system of our society has no value as such. The young kids are not ready to accept the Class Divisions between the Rich and the Poor. For them a kid washing their father's car in the morning has the same importance as their school going friend living next door. And they do give a thought about his health and his living conditions too.Secondly, the film clearly conveys that the children have more love and affection for all the speechless animals around them than the grown-ups in their families. Their souls can feel more closeness to the innocent pets since they don't really expect anything back from them in return. The kids brilliantly portray this true love for their new friends in the film which eventually wins your heart in the end and you walk out with a big smile on your face. Every kid in the group is superb and contributes his own bit to the overall impact of the film. And that's another reason why CHILLAR PARTY becomes a must watch for all.After watching it I only had one question in mind and it was that How the government decides a movie to be made TAX-FREE? What are the rules and the conditions required for the government to take a call, that yes this film deserves to be TAX-FREE and Who actually has been given this duty to inform them that here is a film which can be considered for this special concession. Because if films like CHILLAR PARTY cannot fulfill the conditions to be a TAX-FREE film for the society, then I don't know which film can. So don't wait for it being given an exemption by the government and watch it with your kids at the earliest as we don't make many good Hindi children films very often." 
" The best movie in years","Really the best movie, innocent and would love to say a real reflect of our childhood. Such a natural comedy and light movie. Highly recommended. The way child deceive their parents, their love towards pets and planning games etc everything is really awesome.The child labor is bad thing but this kind of tussle among children is quite natural and very persistent into the society and really reflect a really face of life.I wish to see this movie in big screen and would love to have such kind of friendship for my kid as well. We enjoyed our childhood and i hope our children will have the same opportunity." 
" A movie meant for Oscars","everywhere in the world people talks about innovation in technology, life style, science but has anyone ever noticed innovation in story telling or innovation in thoughts.....if not then you must see " CHILLAR PARTY" then every one will know that politics is not only the game of wealthy and powerful people, politics doesn't always has a bad side it also have some good side which can make people do some good thing.why always Oscar people look after stories which or not meant to win Oscar...they should see this movie and will know which movies are meant for Oscars and which not....i must say this movie has a level for Oscar...though not having a strong visual effects no strong film capturing but it still have some thing which is still considered 1st for the Oscars, which is a STORY... which makes this film unique...this is a must watch story for every one...and will come to know the power in the hands of small kids....what they can do if they get some inspiration and a aim of doing good for love and friendship.." 
" Another treat, parent-children can enjoy together!","Tone, Script & Story: The story is how a group of friends, befriend a homeless guy and his dog. It is further decided by the team's effort if the dog will be saved or put to sleep in case they fail.In the run movie is entertaining, few instance's that lift up the said case is introduction of kids at beginning, they acting tapori after befriending the homeless and last but not the least answering minister with what have been taught to them in school. To see the fate of man with women's voice was also good.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Direction was good along with screen play. It was treat to watch children protest after planning it out. Music: Music was good. Acting: Acting from most of the leads won my heart.Final Verdict: It is one of the treats that parents and children can watch together and enjoy. It is worth adding to your collection." 
" Chillar Party Review","Chillar party is a film written and directed by Nitesh Tiwari and Vikas Bahl.So I saw this film knowing basically nothing about it. Yes, I knew it was something about kids. and also that it has been directed by Nitesh Tiwari (Dangal) and Vikas Behl (Queen). I wanted to see that how these two fantastic minds were got together for a film. It was at a time when UTV Spotboy used to bring fresh talent to direct films (BTW Vikas Bahl was one of the spearheads of UTV Spotboy division). Salman Khan too has received a producer credit for the film (obviously because of his love for kids).Plot: Some close friends of the Chandan Nagar Society in Mumbai jump to help a friend who is in trouble.Story and Direction: We have many a times seen people deciding to help others no matter what (This is mostly the case in Indian Love Stories). But when you put the story onto kids, it becomes an entirely different case. So in the very first scene we are introduced to the "Chillar party". The way the names of the members of this "party" are kept is very unique and funny. As the plot progresses, we see the introduction of characters Fatka and Bhidu. Which also impress us (not initially but subsequently). And then to some of the funny characters of the society. Which also are quite impressive. The main villain of the film also was good. The politician also looking for an issue to come to the limelight was quite real. The tone of the film starts from comedy to drama (which I had guessed when the movie started). But sometimes I also felt quite disconnected towards the film. That was mainly in the first half. For this I blame the writing. So a NATIONAL AWARD for this part, I guess it was not right.Performances: The stars of the film are the kids. The way they conduct themselves in all of the scenes are impressive. A special mention to the character Jhangya. I was laughing in all the scenes he said his dialogue. I was quite happy that all the kids got a NATIONAL AWARD for this. The politician/villain of the film was also very good. And the rest of the supporting characters were all fitting the bill.Music: Amit Trivedi scores the film songs and background score. Heis actually quite good in commercial music too. He should actually do this type of music quite often. After A R Rahman, if I like any musician it would be him. "Tai Tai Phis" and "Hum Ek thali ke" were some of my favorites of this film.Favorite scene: I guess it would be the climax of the scene between the kids and Bhide. The way in which Bhide lashes out at the kids for going rogue to save someone and the way the kids take out their Value Education textbook and say one liners from each page of the book to justify their action was commendable.Verdict: On the whole, Chillar Party was an enjoyable film. Although I felt a tiny bit disconnected during the first half, the film was still good, if not excellent.So for me the film is a 8/10 film." 
" Adore this movie!","One of my all time favorites and I can watch it again and again with my son too! Each child's acting is amazing, what an inspirational as well as entertaining story, excellently produced and directed! Phenomenal music and lyrics too! Another aspect I love is the realism, and imperfect characters of the kids too. They have a streak of meanness, self-doubt, bullying... but are wonderful and pure at heart at the same time, like all kids! Each child character adds his value and has gets attention.Apart from rewards in Children's movie category, it should be considered for awards in adult movie category too as it's for all audiences. A MUST watch." 
" Everyone is special!!","Well, Chillar party is the one of movies which puts smile on everyone's face. From the stating up to end of movie, it is full of emotions and comedy. The child artists in this movie really deserved to be applauded. They have shown tremendous artistic skills and i would say that they are far better as compare to present Bollywood actors. Chillar Party completely summarizes the story of courage and determination. It shows the importance of strong willpower that need to be ignited in each children. This movie completely portrays that your age doesn't matter if you decide to achieve anything.Chillar party is a story of complete grit and this movie is not for the children only even grown up people can learn lot of things through it. I would highly recommend this movie in your watch list. It is the one of the rarest children's movie that Bollywood has produced till now."
