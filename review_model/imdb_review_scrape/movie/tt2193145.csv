" Epic! Watch it!","Pening down my views (not reviews as a Critic) after watching the Premiere. The movie bloomed with adorable sound and lyrical context.Each and every song flows in d very first LAHU and It's no doubt dat every song, background music and singers choice was ultimate and Perfect! Nd it's my bet dat no 1 can deny dat Soundtrack of d muv is not up to the mark. It's Legendary. Though movie strives more on music but Still dialogues and d way dey r reached to u will definitely make ur inner patriotism awake nd if u r a true "mati-premi" den definitely ur hands will join to clap and whistlings all around will add to the traditional custom of Hooting. Especially Mansingh, Kunwar Pratap, Akbar and DodarMal's acting is a Milestone for d viewers who will b astonished at d screens as dey make u feel alive lyk u r a part of d glory ! If it's about d Cinematography again no complaints.At some scenarios your eyes gonna stretch and mouth will spell just 'WOW' Again the way time flips or forwards in the movie is beautiifuly executed which was d most prominent aspect. Direction i.e d main hand to let d movie tied in d eyes of audience never lacked and was much above the expectation. If as a common man u feel how absurdly a particular scene is shot (mainly during the fights) Then again I wanna remind u dat dis movie is not to be compared with d multi-budget and star-power films of Mayanagri bcoz D crew managed in limited resources with around a sweat-hard work of 5 years."
