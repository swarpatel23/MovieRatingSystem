" One more Masala movie from Bollywood came along with one more masala flick 'Elaan'","One more Masala movie from Bollywood which has all the elements to woo the audience. Such movies dominated the film Industry in 70 and still now it is in the making. It is a remake of Krishna Vamsi's (of Shakti: The Power fame) Telugu film KHADGAM released in 2002.Ajay Devgan and Akshay Kumar enacted the roles which Srikanth and Prakash Raj has done in the original. The positive side of the film is that it has numerous mass attractive moments and hogwash situations that would be liked by the common man i.e. the conflict scene between Ajay and Masood, Akshay Kumar introductory scene and also the sequences between Akshay Kumar, Esha Deol, and Archana Puran Singh are well carried through.The climax of the film is a hostage drama with the lofty actions and the awesome acting. As far as acting goes, Devgan does convincingly well as the hard cop, and Akshay gives his fans what they want (he has proved once again that he is a good performer as I predicted about him when I saw him in Khiladi but the Critics and majority of audiences accepted him after Hera Pheri and Dhadkan).Tusshar has done a fine job and he proved that he is a directors actor. Ask him for the best and he will deliver the paramount. After Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hain Khakee and Gayab this is his best performance. Esha Deol is likable. Koena Mitra has except one song and two scenes. Lara Dutta and Laila were just about okay. Laila doesn't have the sexy looks. She can do the gaon ki gori kind of characters. Amongst character actors, Rahul Dev and Archana Puransingh register an impact. 2 1/2 Out of 5." 
" Timepass","What a waste of talent! So many excellent stars all in one movie end up getting stuck in such a stupid production. The script of this film is so weak and dumb. It's rather pathetic when the villains come out and state themselves that they are the bad guys and want to cause as much harm to innocent people as possible. Amidst this amazing star-cast pops up this unheard of actress with no acting abilities whatsoever (the lady opposite Tusshar). I don't think you can be older than 10 to enjoy this film. Some scenes are so dumb such as when Akshay fools his landlord into thinking that he paid him all his money. There so many clich√©d dialogues in this movie! Seems like the writer was off daydreaming when he decided to write this script. Songs are lame and don't sound new at all. The lady who played Ajay's wife looked quite stunning. Direction is terrible; despite such a great ensemble of stars, performances were not quite up to the mark." 
" Get to the point!","While the main focus of this film was really good, it only lasted about an hour. The rest of it was dancing and fooling around, probably trying to make it a longer film. The point of the movie was to capture the terrorist and reveal the secret. Why take so long to get to it?" 
" Best action film ever","This movie was brilliant and entertaining but it is also flawless Songs are pretty decent but above average It was also fun to see akshay Kumar Ajay devgn and tushhar after khakeeThey have done excellent performances heroines like esha deol and Lara dutt were fine in their performances My rating is 5/5 stars Nice movie" 
" Crap","After the success of Khakee, RKS reunited with Akshay,Ajay and made this crap feast which is a remake of A Telugu film Khadgam(2002) which starred Prakash Raj,Ravi Teja. When the promos hit air, it looked like a typical action film,In fact it looked like an old film of theirs which was released with a different name but that is not the case. The film tries to be everything, there are some funny scenes of Akshay Kumar but then we have thousand of other subplots like Ajay's past with Koena Mitra,Tusshar wanting to be a hero and other subplots including a terrorist angle of Rahul Dev who is Akshay's brother.Direction by K Subhash is nothing great Music is okayAkshay Kumar is the saving grace, he delivers a brilliant job in another of his comic role after MSK and followed by GARAM MASALA later in the same year, That was the time Akki's comic act was a novelty Ajay Devgan repeats his AYM act and despite a good performance he was typecast,Tusshar was not convincing, Esha Deol is as usual,Newcomer Laila doesn't impress,Lara Dutta is okay,Koena Mitra annoys,Sharat Saxena is okay, Archana Puran Singh is good, Laxmikant Berde who died before the film released gets no scope and looks visibly pale. Rahul Dev is typecast, rest are okay"
