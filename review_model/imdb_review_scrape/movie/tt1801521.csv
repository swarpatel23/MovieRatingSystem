" Movie touches one of the most critical topic of the society.","Movie was very good. It was better than what I expected. The story is simple and touches one of the most critical issue in our country in a very intelligent manner.It relates to the Honour killing going on in different parts of India. The acting of the senior actors like Manoj Phawa and Om Puri is a must watch. I would request more and more people to watch this movie so that they can see the barbarism of these Khap Panchayats. The only negative side of this movie is the songs. Few songs are nice but the rest are just not required. I would like to congratulate the director for making a movie on such a daring topic."
