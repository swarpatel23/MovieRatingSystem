" Fun With Family","First up, my heart-felt congratulations to the team which comprises debutant director, writers and a fresh casting. Now having read some bad critics' reviews and extremely favorable reviews from friends whose judgement I trust, I finally decided to watch this film. And it was a pleasant surprise.Very rarely does a film which defies all the set formulae defined by the so-called diktats of commercialism in the Indian Film Industry hold such a mass appeal. The film manages to tickle, thrill and touch you in almost every frame. The casting of Om Puri, Deebak Dobriyal, Shreyas Talpade and to a large extent Yograj Singh and Ragini Khanna (both in debut performances) is delightful and refreshing. The message of family values and blood being thicker than water is so effortlessly layered that you hardly notice it through all that comedy, but walk out feeling a warmth in your heart and a smile on your face.The music is basic and reeks of Indianess. The cinematography by veteran Ashok Mehta (of Pukar and Bandit Queen fame) captures the beauty of Kashmir giving us picture perfect moments.I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good dose of laughter and would like to share it with their closed ones." 
" TEEN THAY BHAI---Awesome MOVIE...... hilarious like HERA PHERI...","At last Indian cinema has started following the European art and plots. Excellent movie, entertaining and great actors. You will enjoy this movie even more if you are a Punjabi. This movie shows that how a small budget and excellent direction can result into a full entertainment. I cannot find any fault in this movie. But if you like bogus adult comedies than you may not like this movie because its only healthy comedy. Its a family movie so do not hesitate to take your elders to watch this movie. Om Puri and Shreyas have done extremely well. The story revolves around a mountain and three brothers. Its a completely different experience. Must watch." 
" dead-man will for crazy sibling",""TEEN THEY BHAI" is story of Punjabi family in which three crazy brothers fight with each other.Elder one is Happy (Om Puri)a local shopkeeper in Bhatinda and second one is Chiksi (Deepak Dobriyal) occupationally a dentist and third one is Fancy (Shreyas Talpade)a local Punjabi movie actor.All have their own problems.Happy wants to see get married his three fat daughters and Chiksi wants to get rid from his landlord's debt and Fancy wants to fly to Hollywood.One day they get a news that their grand father's will will be distribute among them if and only if they all will spend couple of days in a home built in Himanchal hill area for three years.Whole movie is based on some funny moments spend by three brothers in Himanchal hills.Actually movie doesn't deal with comedy because there are hardly some moments which make you laugh.Rakyesh Omprakash Mehra has made great movies but this time he couldn't show his movie standard.Also the plot of movie is not good enough.All three are making fun of each other in movie but this trick doesn't make us laugh.May be script is not good enough for comedy genre." 
" The most absurd movie of 2011 served in the name of Comedy.","To start with, 3 THAY BHAI undoubtedly remains one of those few substandard films which should not have been made in the first place. In fact the only question I had in mind while watching it was that "How could a big production house of a reputed director back this kind of spineless project?" Produced by the well known, Rakesh Omprakash Mehra (who I still can't believe directed RANG DE BASANTI), I wonder what inspired him to approve this kind of inferior film?Yes, many a times, a story looks very interesting in its scripting stage, which tempts the producer to put his money on. But actually it's the on screen execution of the subject which counts in the end. And 3 THAY BHAI fails miserably in its execution department. At times while watching it, I was even forced to think that why the film was not shelved in between after seeing its rushes in the initial stages of its making.Anyway, now it has reached the theater and the viewer's intelligence is once again put to test like in many recently released bad comedies. Based on the story of 3 real brothers who are not on talking terms, the script revolves around a novel idea about reuniting them through their fathers left Will and its condition to be fulfilled. But sadly the idea remains an idea and the film goes wrong in its every department, right from its storyline to the direction wasting three brilliant comic talents of the present times.First of all, the snowy backdrop of a deserted house, where the majority of the film is shot, fails to make a direct contact with the viewer. Why the director decided to go for such a location remains a mystery throughout the film. Secondly, the Punjabi family of Om Puri, his fat daughters, the fake dentist, his awkward love story and the coming back from the ashes sequence of the dog, simply take the movie to more lower standards of absurdity as it progresses. In short, post intermission its like a torture sitting in the theater watching everyone jumping, running and falling in vain without any clear direction.Though the title track has some catchy notes and the cinematography also captures the white snowy backdrops well. But still these two factors alone cannot provide you enough entertainment in the theater. Truly speaking the film has got only few, very few good scenes where Shreyas Talpade manages to make an impact and Om Puri (though over the top) gives you something to enjoy with his Punjabi abusive one liners. But the rest of the cast does nothing worth writing. Deepak Dobriyal doesn't convince and Yograj Singh just shouts perfectly. Ragini Khanna doesn't get enough scenes to impress still she does bring in the much needed amount of relief in this all men movie.In all, it's a golden opportunity missed by the first time director Mrigdeep Singh Lamba. And once again its a movie which proves that the actors don't actually know, what kind of project they are working in and they just act as per their scenes, take their money and go home." 
" One of the best movie I have ever seen","This was the best movie I have ever saw.The acting performance by Om Puri was superb.I am fan of this movie and will like to watch it everyday.The movie has some punch lines that are excellent. I haven't seen such a movie in a while and would like to see more of these type of movies from Om puri. The film manages to tickle, thrill and touch you in almost every frame. The casting of Om Puri, Deebak Dobriyal, Shreyas Talpade and to a large extent Yograj Singh and Ragini Khanna (both in debut performances) is delightful and refreshing. The message of family values and blood being thicker than water is so effortlessly layered that you hardly notice it through all that comedy, but walk out feeling a warmth in your heart and a smile on your face. I don't know why people didn't like this movie but it is worth watching this movie. I wonder if I could see this movie in theatre."
