" Nasha, ironically, would be far more appreciated by the ones who aren't allowed to watch it - Teenagers","The story is set in Panchgani, a hill station. Saahil (Shivam Patil) and his gang of friends are a bunch of teenagers in school who have their share of fun and pranks. During the summer break, he and his friends are introduced to Anita (Poonam Pandey), the new drama teacher. She decides to make them do a play. All the boys in the group fall for her beauty and persona. But its Saahil who gets the most intrigued by her. Slowly, he realizes he cannot think of anything but her. As rehearsals of the play go on, he starts to fantasize about being with her though he already has a girlfriend. When Anita's boyfriend/fiancé, Samuel comes to town, Saahil cannot control his emotions.Love and lust are the same side of same coin in this coming of age movie. Younger boy being infatuated with an older teacher isn't a new phenomenon. I think everyone would have fantasized about their teacher and thought that they were in love with them, but we grow up soon enough. The premise is obviously potent, but the major drawback of Nasha is the acting by the protagonist and debutant, Saahil (Shivam) who doesn't have any personality or acting ability beyond staring vacantly, but is getting praised for his non-existent talent. His gang of friends are a bit better, but it was annoying watching them since nobody has at least a sense of decency or moral code. Fun and masti are all good and fine as long as its reasonable and doesn't envelop every aspect of their life. The adults in their family didn't act like adults which came off as unrealistic. Saahil's father just telling him to stop was just laughable. It just doesn't strike a chord with people who are actually born in India.The bigger debut in Nasha was Poonam Pandey's; the woman who makes a noise everywhere in real life with her 'bold' (that was sarcasm. People need to grow up already and stop giving her attention) image. She was pretty unconvincing, but was marginally better than Shivam and that's saying something. The majority of the movie was spent objectifying her and rather than being erotic, it was just so tedious. Her clothes betray her profession as a teacher and she never once did anything worthwhile at the school. As a teacher, her calling that skinny Saahil, 'stud' every single time was hilarious and I wish it were more mocking than sincere because that was so lame. There were two good performers in this movie though - Sheetal Singh who played Saahil's girlfriend, Tia and Anita's fiancé, Samuel who had a strong presence (but not much acting chops). The music is overbearing and cheesy. Add that to the already contrived situations, this movie was almost a 'sazaa' (punishment). Nasha is more romantic (well, as romantic as stalking can be) than anybody could have imagined by seeing the promos and that isn't a bad thing, but the execution was severely lacking. This is the kind of summer that you won't ever remember again in your life. Neither intoxicating, nor romantic, Nasha, ironically, would be far more appreciated by the ones who aren't allowed to watch it in the first place - Teenagers. But, I'm sure they will find ways to see this one if they really want to.3/10" 
" A few really good things, the rest mediocre - Nasha could have been better.","Nasha, directed by Amit Saxena (of Jism fame), stars Shivam Patil and Poonam Pandey, both of whom make their Bollywood debuts with this bold venture. The film was marketed as an erotic thriller, probably because of the reputations shared by both the director and Poonam Pandey. The irony is, this film actually had minimal erotic elements, and did not even try to be a thriller.It's when you go in with an open mind, you realize that Nasha is the coming of age story of an 18 year old boy, Sahil (Shivam Patil), who along with his teen friends, is a high school student from Panchgani (a small city in India). Before his final examinations, Sahil becomes deeply infatuated with the new drama teacher in his school, Anita (Poonam Pandey). This infatuation soon turns into an obsession, uprooting his life and catapulting him through a lot of emotional turmoil, as he stops relating to his family, friends, and even himself. But, as is the case with unfulfilled obsessions, Sahil eventually learns his first lesson in maturity: he comes of age.The Good:What really makes this film come alive is the character journey of the innocent and emotionally vulnerable boy. Shivam Patil deserves the major critical acclaim he has received, for his debut performance as 'Sahil'. Sahil's girlfriend, Tia, is played by Sheetal Singh who makes an admirable attempt to make her role believable. The rest of Sahil's friends are confident and convincing, and their chemistry with each other really keeps the film breathing throughout. Wherever the simple plot of Nasha falls short, Sahil & gang come to it's rescue with solid, entertaining performances. Sahil brings forth innocence and internal conflict, whereas his friends bring in light-hearted humour, quirkiness and good entertainment. Cinematography is quite outstanding in certain sequences, and the credit to making Panchgani come alive goes to the DOP James Fowlds. The music is pleasant, with the title track 'Tera Nasha' being the best one of the lot.The Mediocre:Poonam Pandey gives a flat performance as the supposedly sensuous and charismatic 'Anita'. A better actor could have really made this film complete. The story line, as you can see, is not really one deserving of a standing ovation, either. It belongs to well explored territory in world cinema. The background score is a little too heavy in the first half, but makes a noticeable improvement in the second.Conclusion: Amit Saxena makes an earnest attempt at showing the ups and downs of an infatuated teenager. But all the freshness and entertainment brought forth by the young cast, is compensated by a struggling Poonam Pandey. It's worth a watch for the pool of teen talent, but Nasha could have been a lot more with a stronger story and a competent female lead actor. It's definitely a one time watch, simply because it's better than the usual crap Bollywood churns out on a regular basis!" 
" Not Good But Bad","The movie is all about a boy falling in love with his teacher.The movie has bold scenes and some a rated jokes.The story takes place during the summer camp when the drama teacher(Poonam Pandey) comes to his school. One of her student(shivam patil) fall in love with the teacher.A teacher which he cannot have but has a desire for her.The story is weak .their is nothing in the movie worth watching for. There are lot of unnecessary bold scenes in the movie.Acting of the stars is very poor. they don't live up to the characters in the movie.The movie is not worth watching.This kind of a film was never excepted from the director of JISM part 1. So watch the movie at your own risk/" 
" You are not going to get high on this one.","Nasha means intoxication or getting high. Unfortunately, nothing as such happens here. Its a kind of movie that built a lot of hype thru its trailers and promos. But in the end, its like flat beer.The problem with Nasha is that it depends a lot on Poonam Pandey to deliver. However, the lady can't act. May be someone like Bipasha would have done wonders with this role. Remember Bipasha and the same director had made 'Jism' which was very good. Also, we have seen so much of Pandey on the net that here in the movie she is over dressed...!! So all the burden of the movie falls on the young shoulders of Shivam Patil and boy he delivers. Shivam if groomed well, will turn out into a good actor. He beautifully portrays all the emotions like lover, jealously, anger, suspicion. He is the only reason I can suggest you to look at Nasha.Even the love scenes are mediocre and this is surprising since Jism had some really hot scenes.The supporting cast consisting of a bunch of young unknown actors are good and hats off to the director for choosing a beautiful location like Panchgani to shoot the movie." 
" Worthless","Cheapness reeks outs from the poster to ending credits, Why are people even debating this movie and comparing to Sunny, they are different league all together. Not taking side of anyone, All can be recommended is to stay away.We need actors, for Film Academy, not porn/model, PP is one of a kind, not able to deliver dialogues, no emotions, no story faithfulness.Posters are torn for right reason, they are not a means to entice people to cinema, +18 is not followed in India,when young ones are exposed to this trash, they assume, world functions on similar lines, with dichotomy in Indian Cinema, Dare & Bare and we will cast you, no acting needed.How long will be tolerate this sham >?" 
" NOT a cheap movie...","Plz don't rate this movie without watching it. You might underrate it. The poster gives a wrong impression. It's not a B-grade or C-grade film. It's an A-rated A-grade film. 'A' not as in 'Adult', 'A' as in Adolescent. The script could have been better and the plot could have been more convincing. Poonam Pandey as Anita Joseph, Shivam Patil as Saahil, Sheetal Singh as Tia and Vishal Bhonsle as Samuel gives a fair performance. All of them have executed their respective parts well enough. But there should have been thought put into the writing and propaganda. Promotion could have been less provocative. I'd have rated it 7/10 but since the net rating is too low, I'm rating it 8/10." 
" Nice one time watch","The movie is a nice one time watch. It could have been made better with a stronger story line. Cinematography is good. Moreover, Poonam Pandey looks really beautiful in the movie. The glorious scenes and acting of Poonam Pandey really binds you with the movie. The story has very nicely portrayed the emotions of a youth. The mood swings and the thought process of a boy who is in the last phase of school life and is about to enter the age of eighteen, have been clearly depicted in the movie. The boy is fascinated by his teacher and gets attracted to her. The purity of mutual feelings between the two is amazing. The chain of events is good and at no time, the movie feels slow. I think Poonam Pandey has done justice to her debut movie with her excellent acting skills. Hence, the movie is recommended as a one time watch." 
" Tera Nasha - Only reason to watch this","I was intoxicated: not by the lady's charm but by the songs. A special mention to "Tera Nasha" , for the song is in my play-list this week. I kinda liked the movie story that drew inspirations from Melena, Lolita. The director who gave movie like 'Jism' fails to impress with this. The location was really cool and the lead actor (the boy looking like Dev Patel) did a superb job and the character was finely scripted. Poonam Pandey's acting was bad, in my opinion and could have been lot better. For the teenagers point of view, the movie certainly has love scenes but still lack eroticism. One other good thing is the message, that addiction is permanent."
