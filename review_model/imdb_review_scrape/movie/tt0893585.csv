" Nice kids movie","I actually expected it to be much worse....but naani is a very lovable character, a bit snoopy though and then she chances upon a girl in one of the windows of her society and immediately links it with a child trafficking racket - you know where this movie is headed within the first 20 mins.Nothing great about the story but it is told nicely at a decent pace. All characters are good although there is an unnecessary teen love story in between( with songs) which is totally unrelated to the plot - it doesn't even have a masala value.I couldn't complete this movie but i think its not that bad - just OK."
