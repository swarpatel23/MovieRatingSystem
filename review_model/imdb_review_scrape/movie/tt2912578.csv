" Clever Thriller! ♦ 70%","Similar stories have come up, but this strains on medical negligence. The secondary aspects are various forms of crime that are ubiquitous and known. But what is unique here is the topic and the makers have carved it well to touch where it hurts.Cast performance is very good, especially Kay Kay Menon showing absolute genius. Editing & music is a let-down. The underlying relationships actually worked against suspense plot. Dialogs are worn-out. Certain sequences were useless but still the screenplay keeps the viewers hooked, just because we want to know what happens next. It is a very fine thriller based on borrowed factors.BOTTOM LINE: A engaging watch and a must for budding doctors. Recommended! 7.0/10.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

" An Undiscovered Gem","Rating: 3.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)This came out of nowhere and almost vanished without a trace. But those who caught it, would realize how lucky they were not to miss this unheralded gem of movie. Based on a true story, its a gripping and hard- hitting dram that takes control of your senses from the word go and refuse to let up till the very end. If the medical procedure build up the anticipation and adequately pays fine attention to detail and authenticity, then the engrossing courtroom machinations in the second half are sure to invigorate your pulses and keep you hooked in anticipation of what shall transpire.The entire cast does a fabulous job, with special mention needing to be bestowed on Tisca Chopra and Paoli Dam. But predictably, its Kay Kay Menon who elevates this already riveting drama to stupendous heights, with his callous, smug, obnoxious, and and delectably mean act. Ultimately, you leave the film with a resonating message, that no amount of success and achievement gives one the right to do and escape with whatever they feel fit." 
" Though inspired but a decent and extremely important film for all in the present commercial times, especially for the young doctors.","Just two shows on the first day and less than 10 viewers in the theater for a rare Bollywood film made on the subject of medical malpractice! Why?Because in our country we don't really like to see or talk about the real problems and just wish to enjoy a fantasy world presented along some action, dance and music, featuring our favourite actors. As a result, neither the exhibitors are willing to give any major attention to off- beat projects like these, nor the viewers are interested in WASTING their time on such meaningful, preachy and socially relevant movies quite frankly (Pun intended).So in that scenario, when one clearly knows that it will be tough to get a good number of shows as well audience into the theaters, I would first like to congratulate the producers of ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE, who had the blessed vision to finance such a film for a market which is widely known to stay aloof and discourage this kind of film-making from last few decades.Talking about the film itself, usually I am not supportive to projects which unofficially borrow from some hidden foreign sources heavily. But ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE can be left as an exception since it does raise a very important issue of our Indian society at present, regarding the questionable status of life saver DOCTORS & their Private Hospitals. The whole medical premise of its script and the proceedings of the court with the mention of number 1 being changed to 9 is straight away taken from Sidney Lumet's THE VERDICT starring Paul Newman, which itself is a true masterpiece from the West revealing the ugly commercial aspects of this noble profession.However getting over with the inspired status of the film, AAMC is a decently made flick focusing on an irresponsible mistake by a famous and reputed doctor, who instead of admitting & apologizing, tries to cover up the case with his powerful influence. As the truth comes out, a case is filed on the hospital and the doctor, turning the film into a court room drama in its second half which is both intense and emotional in its execution. Now though it surely could have been much more hard hitting and impressive in its overall portrayal of the issue as expected. Yet it is no doubt a pretty decent and worth praising attempt from the entire team for sure, including many spellbinding performances from the cast led by Kay Kay Menon.In few words, AAMC deserves to be seen both for its crucial issue raised, as well as for its brilliant key performance by Kay Kay as the culprit doctor, Tisca Chopra as the helpless mother and Arjun Mathur as the honest intern together. No one can deny the fact that Kay Kay is one of the most under-rated actors we have at present who truly deserves more good roles and praises both. But here Tisca Chopra shines even brighter in the film as the silent mother witnessing the justice denied by the court with only her tearful eyes looking into the dark. Arjun Mathur makes the best use of the opportunity given in the role of a revolting intern having a 'still alive conscience' and Vishakha supports him well as his colleague. In the court room sequences, Paoli Dam delivers a powerful act playing the lawyer with some great dialogues and Manish Chaudhari, Vishesh Tiwari (The Kid) and Harsh Chhaya perform just fine. The camera captures the tragic emotional sequences in the film beautifully and the Background Score gives it full support in generating the desired impact.Admittedly, it's not a great classic film which would force you to stand up and clap as you might be thinking. It has its own set of flaws, like an unwanted sub-plot of suicide attempt along with the love angle & few songs, as usual. But still it does successfully makes you think about the state we are living in, wherein the established doctors are more worried about their huge hospital running expenses and the intern doctors are more worried about their future careers instead of admitting the mistake they all had made in the operation theater.It makes you fearful, watching the way a reputed doctor performs a minor operation with an absent mind and over confidence leading to some adverse consequences beyond control. And it even forces you to question that have we lost this noble God-like profession too in the current monetary race of our blind society?AAMC also needs to be considered as a trend setting film because we have simply stopped making projects talking about our own social issues quite sadly and moreover the viewers too have stopped showing any kind of interest towards such relevant movies. In fact that is what we have lost in our Hindi Cinema since the 80s and the only film which was made on this issue of 'Medical Malpractices' happened to be NASOOR in the year 1985 almost three decades back. Honestly it was quite surprising to see the film written & presented by the recent 'Horror specialist' Vikram Bhatt and skillfully directed by a not so known director Suhail Tatari. So these two men also deserve their own share of praises for coming up with this thought provoking film in the present commercial times.As a concluding message, we need to grow up and support films like ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE because it's a universal cause the film has been made for. A medical condition doesn't differentiate between a rich or poor coming from any region or religion and thus the film should be taken as a "Wake Up Call" for every single person reading this review, especially the aspiring doctors and the ones currently practicing the divine profession." 
" Involving and well written...","Its sad to say that such cases happen and its a shame for the medical profession. No doubt people make mistakes but running away from them is not a way as seen with "Ankur's" case, rather when one accepts his/her mistakes then only he/she is called a human being. Talking about the movie I would like to mention about the well written script by Vikram Bhatt that was justified by Sohail Tatari's direction. Doctor's are meant to save lives and not to be murderers whatever the reason might be. The male lead that is Arjun Mathur impressed me while other actors were also good and the Sunidhi Chauhan song was touchy. I'm sure that everyone of you would feel this movie somewhere near your heart if you have one specially those who have lost their near or dear ones. Apart from this make sure that you consult a good human doctor and not just a good doctor and be safe from those hospitals that are meant for business purposes only. So, be a good professional no matter wherever you are. Highly Recommended... Ratings 3.5 out of 5 :)" 
" Surely a must watch for urban society....","Today Watched "Ankur arora Murder Case" – In world Movies are of various Genre like romantic, drama, horror, thriller, action, comedy, animation etc. etc. Now when we discuss the type of the movie I think it should always be in 4 categories. First-Brainless Entertainer or Commercial Movie, Second- Intelligent, Third-Intellectual n Fourth – Important Movies. Now which movies are" Important" one. Important movies are neither" intellectual "nor" Intelligent" but they throw you lots n lots of questions during and after the movie, for example "Tare jameen par ".They Compel People to think. They sometimes try to change the Thinking of the society. All movies in World cinema whatever genre it should be, categorized among the above classification.Being in Medical Profession I had grown up interest towards this movie after viewing the trailers n after watch it today, I surely categorize this movie in the 4th category i.e. the Important one. Yes, I am placing "Ankur arora Murder Case" on the same sit with movie like "Tare jameen par", because it throws lots of questions to all sections of the society for think – 1. (For Doctors) What is better – Being a very Good Doctor or a Good human being?2. (For Doctors) Are you the people who are really "de-sensitize" with death? 3. (For Students)What is your Choice-To create a brilliant career on the pillars of LIE or to destroy it by sticking with the TRUTH?4. (For Youngsters)What is your Choice-Brilliant Superb career without Love or a simple career with True Love? 5. (For Lawyers)What do you want - Giving True Justice or Only MONEY? 6. (For Everyone)You all try to BLAME n PUNISH a GOOD (Inhuman, De-sensitize)Doctor for his one and only one Negligence but will you ever remember how many life he SAVED every day which God tries to carry away ? Will you ever BLAME n PUNISH God when HE everyday create lots n lots of child with Congenital Abnormalities?After doing several erotic Thriller n Murder Mysteries Vikram Bhatt's Team now jump into the realistic zone with ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE, which tackles the issue of medical negligence. The team really done an impressive research before the film that in First half of the movie being a medical professional I just can't rule out where I actually am- In cinema hall or in I.C.U or O.T seeing my Colleagues doing their routine difficult jobs. Based on a true incident, ANKUR ARORA MURDER CASE focuses not just on the negligence in the operation theatre, but also throws light on the justice mechanism in our country.In a short Dr. Ramesh (Arjun Mathur) was a junior under Dr. Asthana (Kay Kay Menon) of Shekhawat General Hospital. He loves n had a live-in relationship with Dr. Riya (Vishakha Singh), his co-intern. An 8-year-old boy Ankur (Vishesh Tiwari) dies due to Dr. Asthana's medical negligence n at a point of time Ramesh realizes that a good surgeon is not necessarily a good human being as well. Together with Ankur's mother Nandini (Tisca Chopra], Ramesh declared an uneven Battle for what is right. A battle for justice against his mentor, the hospital and the love of his life.Regarding performances everyone was Up to the mark. Kay Kay Menon is one of my all-time favorite n once again he gave an International level performance. But the surprise package in second half was Paoli Dam. She is Sharpen in every movie. Hats off to the power pack acting of her in the court. The Dialogues are extremely good n sometimes make you to give claps unintentionally in the hall. Scriptwriting also tightens your sit belt as the movie progress. But one point I must say that it good to see this type of movie in future song less.On a whole A BRILLIANT Movie and it deserves a watch by every person of the Urban Society.NOTE: - Being in Medical field I know good surgeon is not necessarily a good human. During my work I also had come in contact with such persons n gained lots of experience. But please don't ask for examples " 
" Plot had Potential but wasted by direction","This plot had a good potential and the actors delivered a stellar performances but it was wasted by direction. The screenplay is at snail pace and sub plots has convoluted the main plot. At times I felt like I am watching a daily serial." 
" Ankur Arora : A comatose screenplay bolstered by power-packed performances","Ankur Arora Murder Case, produced by Vikram Bhatt and directed by Suheil Tatari is a celluloid dramatization of a real incident on medical negligence which led to the death of the patient. Dr Astana(Kay Kay Menon) is a very reputed surgeon and Romesh (Arjun Mathur) is a medical intern working under him in the same hospital. Romesh idolizes Astana until one day, a patient, Ankur Arora dies on the operation table due to the sheer negligence of Astana who is unwilling to take responsibility of the same. Conscience hits Romesh and he sets out on a turbulent journey for justice , against his mentor and the hospital.Emotional drama has been the forte of Vikram Bhatt and he returns to this zone after a hiatus , with a gripping subject which has not been experimented by most in the bollywood fraternity. The initial reels lack the requisite intensity and the plot is marred by a floundering screenplay, but the narrative only gains momentum when the action switches to the courtroom. Tatari makes his characters believable, by infusing the elements of human flaw in each of the individuals, succeeds in absorbing the viewer's attention by creating a tense atmosphere catalyzed by some well-written dialogues.The film is effectively salvaged by some commendable performances. Arjun Mathur delivers a convincing act with the portrayal of a whistle-blower at crossroads of fight against the system.Tisca Chopra is simply brilliant as Ankur's hapless mom, depicts the emotional rupture with phenomenal capacity.Kay Key menon is outstanding with his grey shades.The arrogance, the indifference that he portrays on the screen and his climactic outburst is unquestionably attention-grabbing!Paoli Dam and Manish Chaudhry are efficient. Vishaka Singh is adequate, but she could have been better in the sequences where she has to choose one between her ambition and conscientious boyfriend.On the whole, this is a touchy and sensitive film, and handled thoughtfully. A heartfelt effort for sure. Rating : 3/5" 
" Nice subject......",""Ankur Arora..." is made on a very different and bold subject and tries to show the loopholes in the system of hospitals. It delves into one of the real cases of surgery in which a patient dies owing to the negligence of a surgeon. It's a pity such a real and thought provoking subjects don't get attention in Hindi movies as the film went unnoticed.The first half of the movie shows the condition of the top hospitals where the hospitals are more business oriented. The film provokes an important issue of treatment for which the film deserves an attention. But the second half quite loses the impact of the film as the investigation shown doesn't leave much of the impact and the climax goes for easy answers. Anyway, in the brunch of meaningless films churned out yearly, this film is pretty remarkable in terms of subject which could have been treated better.Rating: 1 star out of 4" 
" kay kay menon special","I watched this movie . Honestly i was not expecting much from it. But as the time passed by i started liking it . The more i saw of kay kay the more i start to adore the artist inside him. The climax of the movie in which he compared himself to god was just amazing piece of act. He put his whole hearted effort in pulling that scene off. Writing this review i can still hear him say 'i m the god' . The story of the movie was good although i didn't like the idea of the affair between paoli and other lawyer which later becomes soar , it seems that this was unnecessary in the movie ( the story would have been much better without it i think, but the commercial success of the film does need something like these elements)" 
" Ankur Arora Murder Case","Good Movie. Everybody acted very well in the movie. Songs were not needed in the movie. BGM in the movie was good. The movie was so interesting at 1st half. The movie lagged and bored a lot at 2nd half. Good Movie." 
" based on real incident","Beautifully presented the whole story 
All character were fit for there respective rolls" 
" An exceptional emotional drama & crime thriller","1st of all, you have to be a parent to feel the high emotion running through out the movie. It's amazing, how a small movie can make you cry or make you feel proud of being honest.I won't spoil anything, but the name of the movie is a big spoiler. That was really a big let down. I'd appreciate if the director/writers would keep that as a secret & deliver as a shock.The movie started in slow but steady pace. Lead actor & actress looked kinda amateurish, but as movie went on the actor picked up the story & blended amazingly with it. The actress struggled through out the movie. This movie could really use some strong artists in it. Lot of them lacked expressing emotion needed for a powerful movie like this. Ankur's mom's friend was another weak one. Or maybe some of the actors were so good, that other ones looked weaker. They could try to avoid unnecessary songs here & there, but I guess as a Bollywood movie, it couldn't take chance of being too bland back in those days. Since it wasn't murder mystery, it wasn't a suspenseful thriller. But it was more like a crime drama. It was certainly not Bollywood dance masala movie or over the top action movie. I also loved how the lead characters were not pictured like a super human who can kick 10 bad guys' back all by himself or dance like Michael Jackson. It's a must watch for parents to realize that how precious our beloved kids are & we should cherish the moment with them, love them & give them as much time as we can. It's a must watch for crime movie lovers. Must watch for doctors to refresh their memory about how valuable their patients life are to their families & what is their profession is all about. Must watch for drama lovers as well." 
" Good decent film","Ankur Arora Murder Case is a yet another film that exposes the crimes happening in a hospital, The film is based on a true story Though Vikram Bhatt does take liberties and adds a lot of masala yet it's a watchable film. The film starts well, KK Menon's character is well established, while there are some subplots too like a love story between 2 interns, The twist in the story is well handled, The going-ons do get filmy and predictable after a while, yet it's well handledDirection by Suhail Tatari is good, Vikram Bhatt's writing too is quite good yet there are some flaws thoughMusic is okayKK Menon is exceptional in a role only a talented actor could play, Tisca Chopra is good as always, Arjun Mathur is good in his role, Vishakha Singh is okay,Paoli Dam is okay,Harsh Chaya is as usual, Maneesh Chaudhary is good, Sachin Khurana is alright with voice dubbed by Vikram Bhatt(a regular) rest are okay" 
" Bad movie, Unnecessary songs and Unnecessary Emotion.","I had a little bit expectation of a SERIOUS FILM. but IT starts with a totally unnecessary song. Unnecessary emotions, doctor and patient, usually doctors do not possess emotions but seriousness how to cure any patient. But this movie has been broken its seriousness by giving songs, unreasonable emotions, and scenes. doctors are not typical like that. Otherwise the story is good. plot is very good. but the script is worst. directed by worst hand. A famous doctor, he is rude and cruel. couple of intern doctors. they have emotions, they sung a bad song and breaks the expectations in the first look. a patient comes with stomach problem and died by an easy easy cause. Eating food before operation, which may not be missed by the famous doctor who have many praise and a worlds class doctor. then songs. then untypical emotions for that intern doctor for the dead patient. it could be more good with the concept, but it failed by a bad bad director." 
" Good Performances But Poorly directed movie","I watched this movie because of Kay Kay Menon Only. I have no interest in Medical movies. Still I found that movie has a very strong script but director ruined all. One time watch if you want to see some hospital drama."
