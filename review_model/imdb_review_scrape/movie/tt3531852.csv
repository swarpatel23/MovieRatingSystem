" Not a Kid's affair anymore..","To cut it very short, Bhoothnath Returns has the spark. Considering the present scenario in India related to the elections, only half of the population practices their right to vote and so, this flick emphasizes mainly on the topic of elections and voting in them. The message is good and the way it is conveyed is very good. It has the ingredients of a commercial movie and yet it does not derail from its path. The child artist Parth is phenomenal and when Sr. Bachchan is there in a lead role, you cannot ask for anything else. Overall, a watchable flick. Had there been a shorter run time, it could have joined the big league. Nevertheless, it is entertaining!Do watch it! Recommended!" 
" One of the finest film of this year!!!","One should watch this film for the great performances of Amitabh Bachchan, Boman Irani and especially the child artist Parth who is actually matches the performance of fellow actors. This film is released during the poll season and it deals with poll campaigning and elections in a humorous way. It talks about the bonding between a kid and a ghost. Amitabh Bachchan is again fabulous in his part and Boman Irani as a dishonest and corrupt politician no less from Mr Bachchan. But no doubt the star of the movie is child artist Parth Bhalerao. It is a mix of fresh comedy and one-liners by Parth, Amitabh Bachchan and Boman Irani. It is surely a family film which can be a good choice for a family outing. I would give it a 9 out of 10. A Must Watch!!!!" 
" An Entertaining & Superbly Acted Sequel!","A sequel to Bhoothnath, 'Bhoothnath Returns' is An Entertaining & Superbly Acted Sequel! Its well-intentioned & even funny, at times. However, a over-dramatic second-hour lessens its overall impact. 'Bhoothnath Returns' Synopsis: As Bhoothnath returns to 'Bhoot World', he is greeted with taunts & condemnation from other ghosts for bringing disrepute to the ghost-community for getting bullied by a kid on Earth. Post the humiliation, Bhoothnath decides to redeem himself & comes back to scare a bunch of kids. Bhoothnath's search for kids brings him to Akhrot, a slum kid who is also the only person who can see him. Together they agree to help each other & their friendship sees them get involved in a cause that is bigger than they had ever imagined. To move ahead they will need to take on one of the country's most powerful & corrupt politician, Bhau. The Lok Sabha elections are nearing & Bhau's victory is a mere formality, or is it? In a world, where a common man is afraid of politics, will a common man's ghost overcome his fear to stand up for what's right & fight against injustice? 'Bhoothnath Returns' has a breezy & funny first-hour. The camaraderie between the friendly ghost & the kid, is a delight to watch. The light-moments in this hour, entertain hugely. However, the second-hour gets over-dramatic. The proceedings get serious & even the pace dips. Also, the excessive running-time over 151-minutes, needed some trimming, by at least, 20-minutes. In short, the first-hour works wonders, but the second-hour is somewhat disappointing in comparison! Nitesh Tiwari's Screenplay is very well-done in the first-hour, but loses steam post-interval. His Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing needed more sharpness. Art Design is excellent. Music by Various Artists, is ordinary. Performance-Wise: Amitabh Bachchan returns as Bhoothnath & he's wonderful all through. Parth Bhalerao is superb. The kid is at par with Bachchan. But, its Boman Irani, who steals the show. He's simply incredible as the screwed & conniving politician. His portions stand out, thanks to his extremely impressive performance. Sanjay Mishra does well, as always. Brijendra Kala is first-rate. In Cameos, Shahrukh Khan & Ranbir Kapoor are perfect. On the whole, 'Bhoothnath Returns' is worth a watch." 
" The loving and Caring "Bhoot" is back in town!!!!","Bhootnath Returns is a political satire where the ghost (Amitabh Bachchan) takes on a corrupt and dishonest politician and changes the society by contesting the elections. Amitabh Bachchan has played the role of a ghost in the best possible manner. The kid was a surprise to me. Even Mr Bachchan has said in his interview, ""Parth, who plays the little boy in Bhoothnath Returns is a commensurate performer, a mature artist and the hero of the film. Even seasoned professionals sometimes are unable to convincingly go through the gamut of emotions that this boy has in BR. He is an exceptional young man.") and I second that. On the other hand Boman Irani as Bhau is as promising as any other actor in the film. One thing which I really liked was cinematography and graphics. The Direction, music, acting, background score are all up to the mark. If you are a true Bollywood lover and Bachchan fan, this movie is certainly for you. DON'T MISS IT!!!!!" 
" Must watch with minimum expectation","Today I watched Bhoothnath Returns. Film is a perfect sequence of previous one Bhoothnath. Story was well written and very relevant to current scenario. An Excellent acting was done by main three leading character which are played by Amitabh Bachchan( as Bhoothnath) , Parth Bhalerao( as Akhrot) , Boman Irani ( as corrupt Politician). Props: (Bhootnath Returns) As I told acting and story was excellent and very relevant. Location was perfectly settled as per requirement of script. You will get a good message in coming election from this movie. Cons: (Bhootnath Returns) Screenplay and Editing could have been better. In first 45 minutes, you will feel some position was unnecessary extended. Songs and composition was not mass appealing.(Actually I don't think that songs was necessary for these kind of movies). Overall: It's entertaining with correct message. I think you should go and watch the movie as soon as possible. Rating : 3.5/5 (from www.tutorpoints.com) Don't wait for DVD's, because election is coming." 
" A Must Watch!!!","Bhoothnath Returns is a sequel to Bhoothnath. It got the right name Bhoothnath Returns, as Amitabh Bachchan (as Bhoot) goes to Bhoot world and see everybody laughs at him not to scare people on Earth. He will be sent back to earth to redeem himself. In his way back to Earth Bhoothnath lands in Dharavi, where he will be stunned by Parth (as akhrot) a kid who can see him and they become buddies. As the story grabs the pace, it becomes more interesting. Bhoothnath stand to contest against Boman Irani (as Bhau) a well known corrupt politician, who wants to stop bhoothnath to contest against him. Bhoothnath Returns came up with a great message to the world is to vote for your candidate. Ranbir Kapoor and Shah Rukh Khan gave their special appearance to promote Election Campaign. Highlight and pick of the movie is Story, Star Cast, Music, Beautiful Execution and Fun Element. For Me it's Entertainment and complete fun. Go watch it !!!" 
" Bhoothnath works on three merits - terrific performance, right intention and fantastic direction","Few actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor have evolved themselves over the years with time and age like . I admire them since they can any play character with ease and utmost sincerity. Bhoothnath Returns comes in the right election time when half of the Indians will go out voting by next week.After being humiliated and joked around from his ghost community, Bhoothnath must return to earth to scare any kid and earn back the respect from his fellow mates. Surprisingly, he again befriends a street- smart kid and the pair together stands up for election after learning about the corruption and evil plan of local builder cum politician Bhau. Co-director of Chillar Party, Nitesh Tiwari chooses the right subject and theme with a noble message. As the continuation from the first part Bhoothnath (2008), Bhoothnath Returns begins with few hilarious scenes and follows the theme of election with right intention. The second half loses the steam and inclusion of songs hinders the momentum of the film. Fortunately, the film picks up the pace and climax ends with aplomb. Music is decent but could have been better. Cinematography and art direction is just about okay. The film belongs to three basic characters -Bhoothnath played brilliantly by the legend Amitabh Bachchan, Akhrot played superbly by Parth Bhalerao and Bhau essayed by supremely talented Boman Irani.Bhoothnath works on three merits - terrific performance, right intention and fantastic direction. Good 3/5www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk" 
" Entertaining and Refreshing Look to a Common Subject",""Trailer hit hai to picture hit. Aur gaanaa hit hai to picture super hit."Well the strength of Bhoothnath Returns are its dialog. Witty and apt. All set to become popular one liners for sometime. Movies about a person returning from the dead to the living world have either been mostly horror or comedy. But this particular installment has a message, almost like a satire to the affairs of the Government, media and lack of empathy to the common people. There are a couple of twists and turns in the story and finally we have ghost contesting national elections as an independent candidate and not using all the supernatural powers he has got. A common man...er a common ghost!Superb performances by Big B, Parth (lookout for this kid!) and Boman (and almost everyone else) helps to make it an enjoyable watch. The camera work and music are commendable. Especially the 'Dharavi Rap'. Probably better than the popular 'Party' number. Weaknesses? Well it drags at times. The movie is well around two and a half hours and it feels that the movie could have been edited better. Anyway a better watch than most of the other Hindi movies released around the same time, very topical and entertaining. 7/10." 
" Not completely a film for children","Amitabhji never gets older. A wonderful film with a message hidden. First 30 minutes of the film were childish but then this movies stated the originality of Indian government. Good message giving movie.This movie represented the corrupt politicians of of India through actors like Boman Irani who acted marvelously in this film.Amitabhji never gets older.

" a better film than many in the recent past","What I liked in the film is its well connected sequences. Each sequence seems to be well rehearsed and acted. Each actor in any frame seems to have given his/her best. They all seem so convincing. You seems to be grinning and smiling all the time and suddenly its time to introspect. The political scenario is captured without its repetitiveness, contrary to other films. No doubt a simple story but told with an honesty that entertains. If one remembers Hugo, the hugely successful 3Dfilm that won tons of awards, please just try to compare. This one is a lot simpler and better....but may not get awards being an Indian film....Some international politics. The Great Bachchan delivers yet another masterpiece. Go and watch the film at least twice---Sharadraj" 
" Riding the election wave with nuance","The nation is plagued with the evils of corruption, greed and crime that are controlled by power-lords such as Bhau (Boman Irani). When the most testing time of elections comes around, these powers rise by making false promises to gullible voters and all hope is lost for the common man. Meanwhile, in a desperate attempt to salvage the reputation of ghosts, Bhoothnath Returns to scare a few kids and gain some credibility and thereby, moksha. While doing so, he must also fight injustice along with Akhrot (Parth) by taking on Bhau in the biggest battlefield, that is the Lok Sabha elections. The plot's absurdity is quickly forgotten with some pragmatic situations, realistic performances and credible viewpoints of the protagonist. An alternate plot would involve Amitabh Bachchan attempting to scare kids, making things really absurd.After some initial bonding between the ghost and the kid, a mutually beneficial partnership between them ensures the clearance of other ghosts from abandoned construction sites until they confront complexities at whose source, they find Bhau. While the political goon prepares for elections, Bhoothnath is motivated by the common man's troubles and their inability to rise above them. Initially with Bhooth powers but later with ideologies, the publicly audible ghost initiates a movement of encouraging voter turnout and contests against Bhau to bring about a positive change. The result of the election is then left upon the wave of positivity among the public and their frustration with evil powers. Director Nitesh Tiwari received acclaim for his Chillar Party and here too, he displays his ability to entertain with light hearted social stories. Topical as it may be, the plot engages with its sincere portrayal of righteous ideologies and practical governance. Not since Munnabhai has the audience witnessed such a fight against the system that also entertains on several fronts. However, that has its share of commonalities and predictability. Boman Irani gets a bit repetitive in his negative role while Parth Bhalerao is only convincing to some extent as his mavali character goes over the top. Sanjay Mishra as the consulting lawyer is excellent. Bhoothnath is perhaps the most human of ghosts around and Amitabh Bachchan makes enacting him look very easy. Party with the Bhoothnath by Honey Singh and Party toh banti hai are the only songs that even Auto Rickshaws will bump to. Unfortunately, there isn't much more to credit the film-makers. While they haven't done anything wrong with the film they haven't done anything outstanding either. Simply because of its topical nature, the film is worth a lazy afternoon watch and it does carry an important message that a couple of major cities need to embrace in the future with regard to voter turnouts. Perhaps it does take an unreal ghost to tell us the simplest message and instill some common sense. Bhoothnath gets that message across pretty well with some song and dance mixed in. 6.88 on a scale of 1-10." 
" Interesting Facts","Watched it on 24th August 2014 on SONY channel sharp 7PM. Yes it's a trivia that the movie was released during the election period.The story of the movie started in with a fantasy but ended with a almost true fact that is,the value of single vote. Amitab Bachhan said on the eve of election campaign who was invisible to others except a kid, how many people enjoy the election day as holiday or go to vote. What an impact !! a lively person doesn't understand the value of one vote while a dead person(Bhootnath) does. Besides the funny act with children, Amitab Bachhan said something hilarious but was serious in real life. When people don't want to vote any party, they vote to their favorite cartoons in Sweden and other countries of Europe. If it happens in India then every cartoon characters of TV or comic books will win from different towns/cities of India. Chacha Chaudhory from Kanpur, Pokemon from Mumbai and many more. Watching this scene of the movie surely children as well as adults had fun and taking it seriously . Hats-off to the best considered actor of the century Amitab Bachhan." 
" A well directed Political satire !","This film takes the story forward, Amitabh Bachchan was sent back to earth to regain his pride and respect but after seeing the corruption and mismanagement he actually end up contesting for elections. The story of the film is well written and executed.Performance wise, Amitabh Bachchan is at his best, before watching this film, I didn't know that a ghost character can be so loving and caring. The small boy has certainly proved his acting skills, from dialogue delivery to expression, he looks really promising. Well the third lead does not need any introduction, Boman Irani did it again. I believe he is one actor in the industry who can make you like an antagonist of a film. Well a film can only be successful if everybody gives their best to it and that's what happens in Bhootnath Returns. From Amitabh Bachchan to Boman Irani to director to Cinematographer, everybody has done their part wonderfully.It is a must watch!!!!!!" 
" Bhoothnath Returns Review- Decent entertainer for all....","Movie:Bhoothnath Returns Rating: 4.5/5Amitabh Bachchan sir is known for his great performance in various movies, as well as new subjects in his movies. Same with his this film Bhoothnath Returns, which has a good message for all, as well as entertainment too!The performances by all actors are great. Especially the boy Parth Bhalerao, who gives the best one of all. Boman Irani too is entertaining with his bone ticking comedy. The music is good. The vfx is great. The film is good from the beginning to the end. It can be said that if you want to witness the rise of new cinema, then Bhoothnath Returns is one such movie.On the whole, Bhoothnath Returns gives some hope for a better cinema, as well as a smile on the viewer's face." 
" Unexpectedly smart, funny, sweet, and politically relevant","I was surprised to see that the sequel to the original 'Bhoothnath' was such a powerhouse of great writing, social conscience, great acting by the kid actor (as well as Boman Irani and Amitabh), and an interesting plot and pacing. As with typical Bollywood films, a suspension of disbelief is required, but this film actually requires less of that than some of the typical romance films where the characters do illogical things at unreasonable times. Each character in this film reacts reasonably to their own situations for once in a Bollywood film. Even the songs were good and reminded me a lot of the original "Annie". This movie has a lot of heart, but doesn't go overboard with the schmaltz. It's about social ills such as corruption and lack of community participation in trying to fix it, but not at all depressing. Feel free to skip the first fluffy film since the back story isn't relevant to the enjoyment of this infinitely better movie." 
" Motivational.","This movie is a masterpiece. Combining a unique concept of ghost with politics, this movie stands out from all of rest freaky horror movies. Amitabh Bachchan stars as the friendly ghost who takes on himself the task to make this world a better place to live. Backed up with good music and humor, the movie definitely scores well ahead. It explores the concept of dirty politics and the condition of Indian government and also motivates the common man to do good and rise up for his country. The plot of the movie is unique and also funny on the same note. Amitabh Bachchan and Boman Irani as well as the little kid have given their best performances. Do watch this movie, not only for AB, but also to get motivated and rise up."
