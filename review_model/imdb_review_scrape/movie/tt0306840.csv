" Ask your heart","Vinay Shukla's Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe is said to be inspired by Sleeping With The Enemy, but frankly I see very minimal resemblance between the two. This one is pretty much a movie of its own, but as a movie, I somehow felt that something was missing. The movie starts off as a quiet romance and later we are presented with a surprising twist, which turns the movie into a dramatic suspense thriller. The film is not entirely convincing though it has its share of good moments. This movie marks the debut of Esha Deol, the daughter of Dharmendra and Hema Malini. Esha is pretty and she dances very well, just like her mother did. She is not even close to being as beautiful as her mother was and she does not have her charm either, but in terms of acting she does a pretty decent debut. At times she really is way too serious but overall she is good. Aftab Shivdasani is solid as Aman, a guy who hopelessly falls in love with Esha without knowing of her past. Jaya Bachchan plays her role with her usual depth. Sanjay Kapoor wavers between good and painfully bad. The film's ending is unexpected but it's okay. The same can be said about the film. Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe is an okay one-time watch, and nothing more." 
" Another remake of SWTE","'Koi Mere Dil Se Pooche' is another remake of 'Sleeping with the Enemy' starring Julia Roberts after Agnisakshi, Daraar and Yaraana.Surprisingly, 'KMDSP' turned out to be a good remake of SWTE with its own twists and turns.'KMDSP' is Esha Deol's debut movie. Esha is Dharmendra and Hema Malini's daughter. And surprisingly, she can emote well on screen.Sanjay Kapoor is strictly okay. Nothing much can be said about him. He does look different in a negative role but not terrorising which his role demanded.Aftab Shivdasani is just okay. He has miles to go to scale the ladder of success in the industry.Jaya Bachchan was excellent. Jaspal Bhatti is as usual a nuisance.Overall, a good movie if not excellent. Watch it if you haven't done yet."
