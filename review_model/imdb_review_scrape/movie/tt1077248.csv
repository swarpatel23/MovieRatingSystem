" True Blue Thriller","There have been very few proper thrillers in Indian film industry, and counting few good ones in them is easy task. However here comes a movie that has the potential to redefine the genre. Most probably this movie will prove to be a dud at Box office, however it will sure go down as a cult for generations to come.In most of the thrillers that I have seen, I am able to second guess the director on what he is going to show. However this movie is something that didn't let me do that. Even though the pacing seemed to be slow in parts, however it actually was never slow. Every few minutes the events took a dramatic change, and even though you realize that this could have been expected, however it was not.This is type of cinema that I prefer to enjoy alone, not with friends Or with family. Simply go into the theater and immerse yourself.My only regret is the way the music was used. Initially only the title track was released but later there was an elaborate album. And it was one of the best score to hit the shelves in a long time. The album gave an impression that it was not typical Bollywood fare, however would be used in background. It had some excellent themes and instrumental pieces and sometimes it gave an impression if modern day Hollywood themes were inspired from Bollywood of 70's, and one expected those pieces to play a pivotal role to elevate the movie. However they were hardly used in the movie, except for couple of occasions.Since I have heard the original album, that is the reason my expectations were sky high from the background music and theme music of the music, but still its a rare masterpiece coming out of Bollywood. This one deserves an elaborate DVD version.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED at ANY COST !! *****" 
" You wouldn't want to miss this one.","I have sat through below average movies several times because I have always believed in something 'keep your expectations low and you are in for a positive surprise'. However, I have been reading the pre release media coverage on this one and had it on in my watch list. I had expectations on this set already and usually it contrives the other way round, but this one proved me wrong. I still get to gain, since this is something which I rate as a rare cinematic experience as far as bollywood goes. I believe its a very brave effort to even think about a plot and to give it the look it has. With more of fantasy driven plots doing the rounds at bollywood box office, movies which venture in to unexplored territories always score better with me. Not just that, this one has quite a few reasons. Cinematography - It takes you to the retro era of the 70's. The color combinations of black and blood red, with the tall fonts for cast and the posters is very pleasing and reminiscing of the era of not so technical but still gruesomely intense thrillers of the 70's. Its a real tribute to that era.Music - The title track is one of the best and looks like to be a big hit already. The blend of the old and the contemporary techno music is very refreshing. Plot - The unpredictability is something which has not been seen in a while considering that you know the culprit through out. It makes you see the movie through the eyes of the characters. Its like a anti-climax repeated several times. It keeps your brain cells on the toes and you better not sit back and relax if you don't want to appear dumb after wards. The performances have been superb and still it manages to have its own humorous moments as well. It reminds me of 'Sholay' since there are so many scenes which appear so discretely superb but blend in perfectly.Highly recommended to the metro-plex audiences." 
" strength of the movie is its .....UNPREDICTABILITY!","Unquestionably one of the smartest films I've seen recently, the biggest strength of Johnny Gaddaar is its unpredictability. Unlike most conventional thrillers with a heist at its core, this one's not a whodunit  it can't be, because you know all along who's done it  the question instead is, how's he going to get away with it? Really the film's biggest accomplishment is the manner in which it compels you, the viewer to think differently  midway through the film you've got the drift, you begin to expect the unexpected, you even begin to predict what's going to happen next. That's the level of involvement you're able to muster up for this film.Dharmendra as leader of the gang, Zakir Hussain as the crass club-owner, Vinay Pathak as the smarmy card-shark, and Neil Nitin Mukesh as the rookie, the youngest member of the gang  you couldn't find better actors to fill out these roles.Zakir Hussain in particular, stands out with a performance that is ingenious in every sense of the word. And Neil Nitin Mukesh makes an inspired debut; he's clearly an actor to look out for.it's a thriller very unlike his own previous film Ek Hasina Thi, and very unlike most thrillers you've seen recently. Watch it because it's that rare film that actually expects you to use your brain.8/10..!" 
" Excellent crime thriller that stands with the best","This seems to be a watershed year or at least month so far as thrillers in Hindi movies are concerned. First there was Manorama 6 Feet Under and now I saw Johnny Gaddar, which totally ROCKS!! A tight and layered script that pays a lot of homage to erstwhile thrillers (tons of 70's references here) but remembers to have its own identity, absolutely SUPERB direction and performances that are indicative of the relish all the actors took in their parts. Even Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy provide some measure of compensation for the emasculation of 70's songs they did in their remix albums by coming up with a background score that's booming with the meaty brass sounds of that era. If there is any flaw I'd say the lead pair of Neil Mukesh and Rimi Sen are kinda vacuous but even that mostly works in the film's favor because they play characters that remain under everyone else's horizon." 
" This one came in from the cold","I have a simple test of a masterpiece. Once you come out of the theater do you masticate the movie in your mind, going over every character, discussing their nuances, idiosyncrasies, opining on the modus operandi and going home to listen to the soundtrack. Johnny comes through on all these counts. A brilliantly scripted, directed and edited tale with convincing performances by the players. There is not a moment which allows you to leave the theater even if the nature's call is of particular urgent nature. The lead actor, Nel Mukesh, does fit the bill in his role as the cold killer but then on a neutral ground I was not too impressed with his histrionics capabilities. The credit goes to the director for riding with all the actors, unique in their own right, and blending them better that those Hawaiin cocktails with little umbrellas on them. Every Hindi thriller that I have seen, be it Don II or Dhoom, I have always tried to guess the twist and have succeeded, more often than not. Well, happy to admit that Johnny G got the better of me. With so many gray characters floating around, twists come dime a dozen and well thought through at that. The movie surely stands as among the top ten best made Hindi movies in my list." 
" Closest to Hollywood Thrillers","Sriram raghavan again throws an ace with this movie. This man has incredible talent and is the director to watch out for. Best thing about the movie is it keeps u thinking throughout the movie what will happen next.Good thing is that he has not added any boring songs which could have ruined this movie instead used it as background score in most scenes.This movie is closet anyone can get to Hollywood thrillers. Niel Mukesh is a great find and the star to look out for. Sadly when i watched this yesterday half the theater was empty. But each and every person in the theater enjoyed it and gave a standing ovation when movie was over. Unfortunately the movie is released at the wrong time. Imagine so many good films hitting the screens like dhol,dhamal,loins of punjab,Manaroma and to add Chak de India. But this is one of a kind and i enjoyed every bit." 
" Johnny Gaddaar","Now this is something hits unexpectedly. Johnny Gaddar quite thoughtfully titled like 70's hard-boiled thriller spins a devious plot and pulls off a fantastic thriller. This is one of those relentless movies just refuses to slow down. Having said that is a complement in itself. Bollywood always has flavor for romance and comedy but thriller is still not first class citizen here. In old days B R Chopra gave us real good mysteries and thrillers, in our time Abbas-Mastaan used to deliver but they have lost their way terribly these days. Writer-Director Raghvan's last venture was brilliant Ek Haseena Thi with Saif's snaky performance- his best till date. With Johnny Gaddar he exercised in the same genre and maturating it more and more. He penned a clever on-the-edge thriller and then got in director's chair doing a through job.Plot is a classic crime setup. Five regular partners going for a deal splitting profit five ways as usual. It is fine until one of guys (of course Apana hero Neil) wants all and elope with his mistress(Rimi Sen). But of course plan will not be executed without flaws and none of the member of the crew is a rookie or push-over. Then onwards film is a gripping tale with twists and turns. It pays-off and it is also not timid to avoid contemporary cliché conclusion.Film doesn't have A-list stars to draw attention but has actors doing their job nifty making this kind delight. Star of the show is Neil Mukesh. This is a very bold, confident feature debut for the talented actor, certainly Lambi Race Ka Ghoda for the industry. Film offers some real good scenes. I really liked the scene when a cop sitting beside the rat in the gang suggests changing the topic and talk about his favorite actor extracting a virtual confession out. And there is another scene shows glimpse of gray in human carnival when one character held on gun-point and asked about how others solve the mystery earlier and met their demise. He bleeding, about to die, smiles wicked; refuses to answer saying that will puzzle and torment him rest of the life.Film got a vintage treatment and several references are made to some classics. One of things I admired most here, hero is not sly or wicked but the script is. There seems so many innocent thread suspended loosely initially to pay attention but double backs in as crucial smart clues later. Altogether film is a darn dandy pleasure. Full entertainment all over. Strong Thumps up JohnnyO!!" 
" Shock and Awe - Slick, Brutal and Pummelling Promethean...","It's the retro age - Recently i saw this Tarantino film (must admit I'm a huge fan of his!!) on the Grindhouse backdrop and it amazed me because of the recreated era - sublimely yet effectively treated and brought on screen. I kept wondering whether I will ever lay my eyes on any such film in the Hindi Film Industry.Sriram Raghavan (of "Ek Hasina Thi" fame) has much the same treatment for us - Shock and Awe. Yes!! It is a complete disappointment for the people' who can predict every twist and turn while watching a Thriller - because the film is genuinely UNPREDICTABLE, right till the credits flash across your gaping faces. (I'm sure you will be staring in sheer disbelief at the audacity of the Director) It is the treatment that blows you off - and the director is not even shy to reveal his "inspirations" for he surpasses them! The plot is about a supposedly well planned and organized barter of things gone wrong - "The Gang" of Five wants to get hold of something which requires a payment of 2.5 crores, an investment which shall get doubled with time. But someone among them betrays. You get to know about who the betrayer is, but not the other four in the gang. It sets off a chain of events that involves five underhand dealers, their families, a cop has a perfect denouement. It is almost like a short story - leaves you yearning for more, just as you thought you knew it whole! Fast and slick - right from the credits which is sexy and suave, through the images - that of Johny's transition from warmth exuding from the eyes to that cold glimpse which petrifies, from Pune to Goa and back again, the bars, the "in-built" and "in-sync" songs, the promises made only to be broken, the message is clear - Evil begets Evil and consumes Evil too.The actors are brilliant (except for Neil who does a good job, but somehow he seemed to be emulating rather than delivering originality). Be it VInay Pathak, Dharmendra or Zakir Husaain, their characters have been sketched to perfection. Watch out for the ironies and the metaphors that have sublimely been blended into the film (say for instance, Why the name "Johny Gaddar" ?)...The camera work has to be seen to be believed. The editing is absolutely A-class. The soundtrack is a perfect foil to the hectic pace of the film. Yes it might have its share of flaws (a particular thread which has no "suitable" ending), but they are an iota to the grandiose treat that I'm sure you shall relish for years to come...I might just add - Watch it on the Big Screen. It's a perfect fit. Hats off to you Mr. Raghavan!!" 
" Watch out for Johnny!!","If you grew up reading James Hadley Chase and his prototype stories of the not so bad (but not good) protagonists, who always fell for the wrong woman, tried to make it big, but things went wrong in a very bad way - then this is a must watch for you! I am still stunned by the sheer quality, charisma and entertainment of this film. Dharam was Garam, Neil is a heart-throb and he can act, even Rimi Sen was competent. Dharam made me so nostalgic for the 70s - "It is not about age but mileage" LOL!!! I liked Rasika, Govind Namdeo, Zakir Hussain - in fact it is safe to say that no one turned in a bad performance. Neil Mukesh is one to watch out for - best when he played the innocent, but also great when he was the schemer. Move over Hritik, forget it Ranbir, the new man about town is certainly Neil Nitin Mukesh.There were more references to everyone's favorite moments in books (Hadley Chase mostly) and films (of course the ubiquitous Johnny Mera Naam, and many many Bachchan films including the early and all important Parwana) than I can remember (and it might take another viewing to capture them all!), there was your favorite music from yesteryear's (Aage bhi jaane Na tu for one) and some cool new stuff, there was blood and gore galore, and there was an inevitability to the story (just like your favorite Hadley Chase book had).And after you are done watching Johnny Gaddaar then go back and watch Jewel Thief and Johnny Mera Naam, maybe even Parwana, to get even more out of the film!I highly recommend this film to all lovers of pulp fiction (and I do not mean the film alone), the noir genre, heists, double-crosses, and just unusual cinema that is very well done. Kudos to Sriram Raghavan, I wish I could get into his head to see where all this came from." 
" Johnny Scores !!!","Neons,Red neons, Yellow Milestones, Pune Railway Station,Lancers, maroon Maruti 800, Bombay-Pune Highway,more Neons and UV Lights in da Club, no Bling Bling, only CASH and Bam Bam. Phew!! What a ride!!Johnny Gaddar is ..wait for it...the Best Hindi movie of its genre. Should I say that again or was I loud enough to make my point clear? ADLABS presents, ...Sriram Raghavan's...and then Boom. The title credits are absolutely a thing to watch and watch out for. Awesome is the Word..or is it Legendary. OK, I should come out of the Barney-shell and just tell you more about the movie and why I loved it. Reason 1: Solely for the title credits which is a huge tribute in its own right to all the 60's and 70's thrillers, especially ( and well clearly mentioned too) to Vijay Anand's works from Johnny Mera Naam( from which the movie's title has been taken) to Jewel Thief . I definitely felt that Mr.Raghavan always wanted to pay a kind of homage to them, and what rightfully done!! In scenes like, Rimi Sen reading R.K.Narayan's 'Guide'( made into a film by Vijay Anand) or well, Vikram, the protagonist who is a big Big-B fan, watches Parwana (may be for his influences eh!) to Johnny Mera Naam. Well,there are other trivial stuff too which would soon make their way on the trivia list of IMDb like, while Shiva is being called the first time, he is watching Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. The movie also brings back the genre of "Kaun-Kaise-Kaha-Kyun" in a very crisply done script just like taken from the pages of " James Hadley Chase".Reason 2: This is not a Who-Dun-it? It is more of how did he-when did he-kinda flick, and it continuously kept me( and also all the people at the theater) at the edge of my seat and made me wonder, about what next?It made me think and think, and hold on to the chair tight, made me wanna kick the guy sitting in front of me talking over the phone, cause I was sensing the air of suspense and was totally gripped by the claws of this reel-o-magic. Reason 3: The entire cast,from the mastermind of the "plan-A" Seshadri (Dharmendra) to Prakash a.k.a Pakya(Vinay Pathak) to the very briefly kept Twinkle a.k.a Mrs.Shardul (Rimi Sen),everyone has been able to pull off exactly what the film expected them to. Debutante Neil Mukesh as Vikram a.k.a Johnny G is a discovery. He is not just plain wood as the other six-packs,sculpted physique league of bloody ordinary gentlemen are, but makes his presence felt throughout and has been absolutely successful in making the character of Johnny Gaddar come to life. Johnny isn't a strong guy, he is a smart guy. He has his weaknesses and he is scared of the bigger and stronger Cons. But his smartness,his luck and his perfect timing makes his Plan-B work. And Neil makes us believe that he IS Johnny while he deceives and betrays everyone. Last but not the Least, Zakir Hussain as Shardul is absolutely brilliant and Ashwini Kalsekar as Mrs.Pakya a.k.a Beauty Parlor is the icing on the Cake. Go watch the movie to find out why.Reason 4: The movie includes PUNE. Yippeee. From Pune Station to MG Road, to glimpses of Magnum Mall and Bombay Garage(was it?) . Woo hoo. I loved it. Reason 5: all of the ABOVE and even more. Johnny G offered me a slice of Tarantino even in vernacular. Especially the scene when Shardul is being hit and falls down back-first on his glass center table. Kill Bill revisited. Woohoo. What I liked most about the movie besides the Title Credits, is the pace at which the movie carried on. There are no extras or fillers or any element of Priyadarshan or RGV ki Aag. I have watched Mr.Raghavan's previous flick "Ek Hasina Thi" and I thought it was a good movie. Johnny G just surpasses all the expectations I had. It is a brilliantly made movie in all aspects from the sets to the script to the action chodeography to the fast paced editing to the jaw-dropping fast cinematography which captures the closed Train Toilets to the dim-lit compartments as brilliantly as the crowded dance floor of Club Escape or the intense nightmare mood of Vikram's apartment. Complaints: Only complaints are that it is a rated-A movie. So well, besides the Bam-Bam and the Dhishum Dhishum, I wanted some Muah-Muah too. Not that the movie did not have any scope for it. Rimi and Neil could have had a moment . Friggin!!!!! Just when you thought that it was flawless, my hormones pop-out. LOL. Need I say more. A word more spoken and I would start sounding like I have been paid for the publicity of this movie. Go watch it and you will and shall LOVE it. 8 on 10" 
" A Rare Species","Here is a film directed by someone whose previous directorial venture (Ek Hasina Thi), though stylishly executed, was a box office dud. A film which has Dharmedra as the biggest name in the credits. The second biggest is perhaps Shankar Ehsaan Loy, who are favorite composers for big banners these days. They have done a neat job here as well. A film which has a debuting actor with musical genes in lead role (he is grandson of legendary singer Mukesh). So what would be expected from such a venture? Not much I reckon. And that's the biggest strength of the film. Low expectations, high returns. The film is classic thriller by all standards. Be it acting, script, direction anything.Commenting anything about the storyline would be a sin for this genre of cinema. Though its not suspense of "Who did it" sorts, but still its best that story is left untold. But it deserves to be told that unfolding and turn of events is gripping. It keeps you glued to your seats.Technically the film is a jewel. Cinematography is top notch. Editing is crisp, narrative fast paced. There is hardly a dull moment. Background score is racy and innovative. Sriram Raghvan proves that the promise shown in his directorial debut was not fluke. He is a director to look out for. And thanks to him, we now have an actor too to look out for in Neil Nitin Mukesh.So, some may call Johnny Gaddar a cult classic, some call it style exemplified. But in simple terms, it's a good film. Go and watch it." 
" Sriram Raghavan does a Pulp Fiction !!!","Relax. The movie does not rip off Pulp Fiction.Rather, it captures the ESSENCE of Pulp Fiction. And that essence is HOMAGE... Just like Pulp Fiction, Johnny Gaddaar is a homage to some of the classic thrillers of world cinema. But that's where the similarity ends.Both movies are different and have different appeals. While Pulp Fiction has it's appeal in amazingly witty dialogues and a few memorable performances, Johnny Gaddaar has it's appeal in a taut storyline with a good "twist-at-the-end".The story follows the protagonist as he double-crosses his gang members, and then tries to ensure that his gang members do not suspect him of double-crossing. Whether he succeeds in evading the gang's suspicion and making off with the booty is what makes the entire plot.The plot has all the elements of an edge-of-the-seat thriller. However, what differentiates Johnny Gaddaar from the rest is the Style of it's execution. The movie has Style with a capital S. The scene in the train stands out as an example of how the director chooses to use his influences. He uses the plot sequence of the classic Hindi thriller "Parwana" and executes it in the style of classic French thriller "Rififi". And the outcome is excellent....Johnny Gaddaar also rides on some excellent performances from it's cast. The stand out performances come from Zakir Hussain (Shardul), Vinay Pathak (Prakash), Govind Namdeo (Kalyan) and Ashwini Kalsekar. Dharmendra is excellent but should have been given lesser English lines. English doesn't seem to come naturally to him. His eloquence in Hindi & Urdu could've been better utilized in this film.The protagonist (..or antagonist..) Vikram is a complex character to portray. Debutante Neil Mukesh does a fair job of it. Sometimes you feel that he is putting some extra effort to say his Hindi lines. Whether he is capable of histrionics in his likely future projects as an actor is another question mark. However, one cannot deny that he has good screen presence. The soundtrack is noteworthy & is consistent with the mood of the movie.Johnny Gaddaar has it's share of flaws too. The dream sequence feels like a forced attempt by the director to instill some needless thrill in an already thrilling film. The gore sequence with the nurse also feels forced & seems a bit incongruent with the movie. These scenes, to a certain extent, adversely affect the movie's length as well...However, with it's intriguing storyline & innovative style of execution, Johnny Gaddaar sets a precedent for other thrillers to follow...8/10" 
" Johnny Slick! One Hell of a Movie!","A combination of slickness and intelligence is rare in Hindi cinema. 'Johnny Gaddaar' is one such film. Not only is it slick and intelligent, it has a gripping fast-paced plot, impressive performances (none bad), keeps you at the edge of the seat and entertains. It just kept me so involved! I loved the numerous reference to Indian classics (like 'Bandini', 'Johnny Mera Naam' and so many more) and the Chase novels. The dark humour provides several laugh out loud moments e.g. during the second scene Dharmendra turns on the stereo to listen to his wife sing. Raghavan's inspiration clearly shows (note inspiration NOT ripoff) and the man did one hell of a job in creating an Indian pulp fiction! The cast itself is a smartly gathered unusual ensemble that works very well. Dharmendra rocks as the leader of the gang. This guy has brought a wise freshness in his last three films (the other two being 'Life..in a Metro' and 'Apne'). Zakir Hussain, Govind Namdeo and Vinay Pathak are great in their parts. Ashwini Kalsekar is natural while Rimi Sen is no good. However, 'Johnny Gaddaar' rests on débutant Neil Nitin Mukesh. The actor isn't fully comfortable in front of the camera but his awkwardness and novel presence fits the character (who is the newest member of the gang).The background score deserves special mention. The instrumental tracks heard in spy movies, the trance music...all add a nice and cool touch. The item number in the end could have been shortened but the songs give a feel of the wild 70s.Raghavan's debut film 'Ek Hasina Thi' happens to be one of my favorite thrillers. Now I can add his second film to my favorites! Even though the plot becomes slightly predictable during the last 45 minutes, it doesn't lose its charm. It's a howdunnit rather than a whodunnit. Undoubtedly, one of the most enjoyable films of the year and one of the best of its genre to come out from India." 
" best movie of 2007. must watch","A fast-paced thriller, Johnny Gaddaar is ample testimony that you can make a gripping Bollywood movie without any of the big names.Also, as long as you have a decent story you don't have to go gallivanting around the globe filming in locales like Namibia, Australia, Switzerland or Brazil.Without doubt, Johnny Gaddaar comes with a nice story and a tight script. No meandering or sloppy detours here.Most Bollywood movies are unwatchable despite the presence of big name heroes and sultry sirens because of the wafer-thin stories. That is when our Bollywood bozos are not shamelessly stealing from Hollywood. Fortunately, Johnny Gaddaar is different.In the late British author James Hadley Chase tradition of providing a strong protagonist who is usually a criminal but not really a completely evil or loathsome figure, Johnny Gaddar offers us the criminal Vikram. Bad but not repulsive and carried along mostly by the tide, Vikram holds our attention throughout the movie.Johnny Gaddar packs all the ingredients of a fine thriller - love, crime, sexy girls, action, unexpected twists and betrayal.Newcomer Neil Nitin Mukesh (grandson of the famous singer Mukesh) does a decent job as the young lad Vikram in a haste to get rich. Only in one crucial scene featuring a confrontation with Dharmendra does Neil Nitin Mukesh falter and fails to deliver the goods.Besides Neil Nitin Mukesh, Dharmendra, Zakir Hussain, Vinay Pathak and Ashwini Kalsekar deliver solid performances too. Even that Bollywood clown Rimi Sen has thrown in an acceptable performance here.The story centers around a gang of five criminals headed by Seshadri (Dharmendra) who embark on an assignment that is supposed to net them a hefty profit in just a few days.But one member of the gang has other ideas.He wants all the money for himself so that he can make a new beginning in a far off place with his girl friend Mini (Rimi Sen). So the double crosser sets in motion a train of events with deadly consequences for the others.Johnny Gaddaar is easily one of the best Bollywood movies we've seen in this year.10/10" 
" Awesome thriller - though we know who the killer is!","It is an awesome thriller even though I know from the start who the killer is! I liked the movie a lot. It is like the Hitchcock movie "North By Northwest" or like the movie "Phone Booth" - when you start watching it you cannot stop, you have to see the whole movie.Sad but a true fact that non-masala good movies always fail at box office, so it is no surprise that Johnny G didn't do well at Box Office.I wasn't aware of this film director before, but the way the movie is directed and the bits and pieces are displayed - I am really impressed! Each and every detail are so nicely laid out, even the titles at the start are really impressive. Don't forget the way the word "Intermission" is shown. It is a work of a genius and very rare movies display such nice details.Adding it to my "must watch" movies list." 
" Thinking at its Best....","This one is a sheer treat to watch. It really makes you think and praise all of them who contributed to the script, because besides the actors and the movie, script is a winner here. It has three things which I look for in a movie - crisp, slick and most importantly engaging. So, even after the audience knows everything here right from the outset ,it still keeps you glued to see the next frame. Neil Nitin Mukesh is simply outstanding and he deserves all the praise for enacting his complex part with élan. Dharmnedra, Vinay Pathak and Zakir Husaain are all brilliant in their roles. Rimi is good, though she doesn't have much to do. And she may be thinking in the end - Why Boys have all the fun in the movie? But hold on, boys don't have all the fun here. Watch the climax and find it for yourself. And last - Sriram Raghavan, I loved Ek Haseena thi. And you have bettered it this time."
