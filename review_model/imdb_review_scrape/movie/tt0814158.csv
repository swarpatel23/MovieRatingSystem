" A phone call from Kashmira","Ishq Qayamat is an average thriller. It has its moments of suspense but it is heavily flawed and the effect is not very strong. The film addresses the famous issue of adultery through the main protagonist, Suman, a young woman who is married to a wealthy businessman and, unsatisfied with her marriage sets on an affair with a friend from college. Soon she becomes the target of daily blackmails from a young woman named Shweta. That's where the suspense begins. It is effective at some points, but it falls short mainly due to its poor attempts to convey a serious message, which, given the poor script and the lack of substance, does not hold water. The sound in this movie is very bad and the dubbing is clearly noticeable. The plot line is very similar to that same year's movie Murder. Not to say that Murder was a particularly great film, but it was far better shot and more entertaining and it actually had some very hot scenes. The love scenes in this film are done quite aesthetically but they are still poorly made. Suman Ranganathan was one struggling actress who never really managed to get more than tiny supporting roles in big movies. In this movie she gets a role which could have been good had she put more soul into it. She is not very convincing and fails to display her character's confusion though she is unquestionably good looking and pretty. In all fairness her role is totally underwritten so it would be silly to expect anything special from her. Milind Gunaji does an okay job but he is far too restrained at points. Deepak Jethi is awful and so is Kashmira Shah who badly overacts her part but frankly she is so hot that nothing else matters. Ishq Qayamat is an okay one-time watch, the climax and the ending do manage to surprise but the final verdict is that this is just another mediocre thriller which could be easily avoided." 
" A sometimes frustrating tale of an affair!","A young woman and an older man (played by Suman Ranganathan and Milind Gunaji respectively) are seemingly happily married, until one day when the wife decides to go on her college reunion retreat, where she meets up with an old flame. Sparks fly and one things leads to another between them and before you know it, the pretty plucky wife becomes an unlucky unfaithful overnight. In the morning, she makes it clear to her former lover that there can be nothing between them because she is married now and he agrees. They both return to their separate ways when the retreat ends, only to be brought back together again by a blackmailer(Kashmira Shah) who has pictures of their illicit affair and plans on going public with them.There are times in the film where you will nearly tear your hair out wishing that the young bride would just come clean to her husband. Or times that you would just want to flat out slap the blackmailer for being so over-the-top and not to mention annoyingly conniving. But other than that it's an okay film."
