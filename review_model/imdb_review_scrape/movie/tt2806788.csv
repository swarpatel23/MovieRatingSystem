" Fukrey : Amaxing Laugh Riot","Fukrey, directed by Mrigdeep Singh Lamba and produced by Farhan Akhtar/Ritesh Sidhwani is set in the bylanes of East Delhi and is about four youngsters who want to make it big in life - but through adopting shortcuts !Cocky Hunny(Pulkit Samrat) and goofy Choocha(Varun Sharma) are two slackers who want to get into a reputed college with the solo intention of ditching classes and ogling at girls. Accounting-phobic Laali (Manjot Singh)wants to get into this college because her lady love. Wannabe musician,Zafar(Ali Fazal)needs funds for his father's treatment. All of them need fast buck and make a deal with a wicked hustler,Bholi Punjabi(Richa Chaddha) but their adventure misfires big time when Choocha flounders.In this bizarre twist of events, how the band of boys come out unscathed forms the crux of Fukrey.Much of the film's sheen is derived from its situational humor and Mrigdeep Lamba , who made the horrendous Teen The Bhai, takes a giant leap in direction and writing with a sharp eye for details and getting the nuances of middle-class lifestyle of Delhi-ites right.The narrative is smooth and Lamba infuses some of the ROFL moments when Laali's bike parts are stolen each time outside the Gurudwara or Choocha escapes from Bholi's henchmen. Delhi Belly Dejavu !Choocha's inspection,oops I mean Inception-inspired dreams and Honey decoding them into a lottery number are sheer master-strokes !Ram Sampath's music is peppy and rustic with fresh voices and sync well with the proceedings. Ambarsariya, the traditional Punjabi folk song tops the list, with Sona Mohapatra's mellifluous renderings!The camaraderie depicted between Honey and Choocha is the heart of the enterprise and will have you in splits. Pulkit is endearing as the jugaadu-dude of the gang.His mannerisms are very typical of a Delhi boy and he gets the act right. Manjot Singh makes a solid impact with his straight-faced humor and impeccable dialogue delivery.Ali Fazal bores a serious look on his face and does justice to his character.Varun Sharma as Choocha is the scene-stealer and the real surprise package. As a debutante , he exudes ample confidence.Richa Chaddha outshines our fukras with her superb act of Bholi Punjaban and once again proves her supreme talent.Priya Anand and Vishakha Singh are adequate, and don't get much of scope in this male-dominated fare.Pankaj Tripathi,as usual,is first-rate.On the whole, Fukrey is indubitably a fresh wave of comedy with a fitting finale and a justified message to today's youth. I laughed and laughed , until my jaws ached and belly gave pangs.Worth a second time watch !Rating : 4/5" 
" A Real Fun Time with just a Simple Plot!","FUKREY is a college comedy directed by Mrigdeep Singh Lamba, starring Pulkit Samrat, Varun Sharma, Manoj Singh, Ali Fazal and Richa Chadda.The film revolves around the lives of 4 guys; 3 of them are trying to get into college even though they never study, and the remaining one is trying to get money for his father. All of them are interested in Hunny and Choocha (Pulkit Samrat & Varun Sharma)'s idea. Whenever Choocha dreams, Hunny is able to break that dream down to a lottery number, which always ends up winning.Fukrey is an extremely interesting film under the 'Excel Entertainment' banner. It has a simple premise about a simple idea that goes wrong and how four people try to earn money just in order to go to a college or to help out a person in need. The jokes aren't as mindless as you think; they are simple and funny as well as related to the movie at the same time.The acting in this movie is quite good. All the cast did a fantastic job with whatever role they had.The songs are quite decent as well. They can be heard by both generations; 'Fukrey' and 'Beda Paar' is more for the modern whereas 'Ambarsariya' has a more simple tone that can be enjoyed by any crowd.In the end, Fukrey is a simple comedy. It isn't GREAT to a point of praise, but it does well enough to make you laugh out loud and exit the cinema saying, 'I had a great time.'FUKREY- 8.5/10" 
" Awesome movie. Worth watching...Best movie of the year !!","This is awesome movie. Must watch movie. Best movie of the year till date. All the actors have made really great performance unlike so called star sons. Story line up is also new unlike typical Indian romantic stories. You won't feel bored during entire movie. Songs are OK but acting of all actors is mind blowing. They don't have big star cast but definitely better than big star cast movie. Movie has real Delhi locations, not funky sets. I would recommend to watch this movie. You will laugh a lot and every moment, you will think what happens next. People should realize that without big start cast also, a movie can be good." 
" Short, confusing and HILARIOUS!!!","My family wanted to go to the theatres this weekend and I had to go. They all went to watch the horrendously boring Ye Jawaani Hai Deewani, but I chose to watch this because of all the rave reviews. Let me tell you, the other reviews were correct! I can't remember any scenes except for a few funny ones, nor do I know any of the actors in this. The plot was wack, and the songs were meh. But, the film was undoubtedly hilarious. There are funny lines, funny situations, and funny actions. This film is exactly what you want to watch if you want incredible hilarity for 2 hours. You'll go home happy, and you're senses will be soothed. I'll give it an 8/10, worthy of watching in theatres and a few more times later, because it will be just as funny." 
" Laugh riot to the core","Fukrey is one of those movies which wouldn't let you stop laughing for any moment. The humor is so spontaneous that most of the times you'd laugh out of surprise. It's a fresh script, thematic, and doesn't rely on one-liners to get you in splits. The storyline is compelling and witty. A story about 2 school kids who desperately want to get into a premier college despite having failed their 12th class twice (one of them failed even in 1st class). Their unique talent is that one dreams something absurd, the other decodes that dream to get the winning number of a lottery. But a series of incidents get them into trouble which is a hilarious journey, along with 2 other guys.The movie is buoyed up with well-sketched characters portrayed so perfectly by the actors, which is a boon for the movie. The real flavor of Delhi's lower-middle class mannerism and lingo is accentuated by the cinematography that focuses on the respective areas rather than 'Dilli-Darshan' (Voyaging Delhi). The script might be silly or illogical to many, but that is what creates the humor here! It's not an intellectual comedy, but it ain't stupid as well. It's well-balanced between the two. A must-watch." 
" Worth a watch for the youth...","The movie starts a bit slow but then it catches the speed. One of my highly anticipated movie of 2013 that didn't disappointed me but was different in its own way. All the characters were good in their roles specially Bholi Punjaban. Its true that we many a times opt for shortcuts in our lives but after watching "Fukrey" you might end thinking twice every time. It is basically based on four friends with their struggle to earn money for their respective needs and their journey goes crazy enough. A couple of good songs add charm to the film. Unlike other comedy flicks in Bollywood this one has a very realistic approach that carries humor as well as seriousness. Highly recommended... Ratings 3.5 out of 5" 
" Fukrey is a Laughton which will be remembered for its utmost hilarious moments","College life is one of the best years of your life - education , college fest , private parties , cool girls , ragging and sometimes new ideas to earn some pocket money. Every student who passes out of school wants to join hip-n-happening college. Unfortunately, very few are able to make it through. Fukrey tells the story of 4 young clads - Hunny and Choocha are good-for-nothing school students who wants to relish the luxurious environment of college. Lali wants to show his back-stabbing girlfriend that he can pull-it-through the same college she is admitted in. Zafar is unlucky musician who wants money at any cost for operation to treat his paralyzed father. 4 of them falls into the trap of local female don and must do something to return back the money they lend from her. Set in the lively city of Delhi , Fukrey is fun to watch. The story does not have much to boast and screenplay is timid but yet it is the execution of the plot which makes it watchable. Mrigdeep Singh Lamba does a fairly good job in keeping you entertained with comic scenes and is sure to bring down the house with hilarious moments. Cinematoraphy is amazing capturing the locales of Delhi. Background score is good. Out of 4 protagonist , Pulkeet Samrat and newcomer Varun Sharma stands out with superb chemistry. Both of them should be applauded for fine comic-timings. Richa Chadha and Manjot Singh do lend in good support.Fukrey is a Laughton which will be remembered for its utmost hilarious moments.

" Amazed by the leaps of Indian Cinema..","Really, its amazing to see the new crop of Directors, Actors, Writers, Musicians, Singers, Technicians that is driving Indian Cinema to a new Horizon. This new generation people are threatening the traditional Hindi Cinema people by their talent and either putting these people on the sidelines or pushing them to try something new. Sanjay Leela Bhansali making a movie on Mary Kom, Karan Johar trying his hands in Bombay Talkies and other big film houses giving shelters to the new gen directors are amongst the few example of changing times. Of course some people are put on sidelines and some have not learnt. And Shahrukh trying to work with successful comedy Film Maker Rohit Shetty to save his career & brand somehow.For awesome review read it: http://mayahirahasya.blogspot.in/" 
" An Invalid Plot That Causes Laughter. ♦ 57%","Fukrey has got its base trembling with a plot so naive, viewer discretion is recommended. Its screenplay is bit confusing for people who don't pay attention. Otherwise, it is a healthy Bollywood comedy film.Cast performance is nothing to talk about but the actors have managed to create enough chemistry between themselves. Although love doesn't come center-stage, it amuses. The music is catchy, but the lilts could've been improvised. Same theme music is used all over the 130 minutes. Cinematography, I would say, is brilliant especially shots involving mirrors. Editing is quite good.But, since the foundation itself is slimy, I rate it an AVERAGE 5.7/10. Mixing lucid dreams with reality doesn't really prove a point. The story in second half is much like Delhi Belly & other caper films where a gang try hard to please a big boss. It's a bit clichéd but the journey adopted by the Fukreys is enjoyable. They entertain and that is what matters.Dialogs are funny & straight, songs are good and overall, a fine comedy without classic cinema potential. Had expected more from the team.BOTTOM LINE: A sleeper hit that can be enjoyed once, with like-minded friends.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity: Strong | Sex/Nudity: No | Porn: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: No | Smoking: No | Alcohol: Mild | Drugs: Mild" 
" A Joyride!","Mrighdeep Singh Lamba's 'Fukrey' is amusing, funny & very entertaining. No, its not flawless, but in totality, this recent sleeper hit works big time! 'Fukrey' Synopsis: The paths of four dream-chasing college friends cross with an array of colorful characters, from a tough-talking Punjabi female don to a Jugaad Baaz college watchman. Mayhem ensues.'Fukrey' is fun from the word GO. The central protagonists as well as the supporting characters, particularly, the villain, are diverse & interesting. The humor works, because the Screenplay Written by Vipul Vig & Lamba himself, is genuinely good. The first-hour is absorbing, while The Second-Hour progresses furiously. Lamba's Direction is rustic. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are perfect. Music by Ram Sampath, is fabulous.Performance-Wise: Pulkit Samrat, Manjot Singh, Ali Fazal & Varun Sharma are excellent. They share a terrific on-screen chemistry & portray the twisted heroes with great energy. Richa Chadda is outstanding. She stands out as the menace. Priya Anand & Vishakha Singh are restrained. Pankaj Tripathi is marvelous, as always.On the whole, 'Fukrey' is a Joyride!" 
" An unrealistic movie about impractical dreams","Had expected a lot because so many of my friend liked it..... but I was totally disappointed..... there's no challenge in acting so acting is OK.... you won't be able to relate a single event which can happen in your life.... well you can dream about it!... I think from these kind of movies someone should be able to make connection to his/ her life.... otherwise it's easy to produce such movies to our Indian audience.Movie highlighted the Indian Jugad with some twist & turns worth admiration.... all in all if you want to watch a movie just for fun and don't want to mull over then you can have it once!!" 
" One of the better and Different Comedy Movies from Bollywood","I found Fukrey to a decent comedy movie from Bollywood after a long time. For a change it did not have the cheap and double meaning jokes that Bollywood crap is so prone to these days.While the script was not that strong the movie had a good tempo all along and was fun to watch. Given that few Bollywood movies have any script this one was a lot better.Most of the cast, specially Choche have done a fairly good job. Some of the stuff was mindless but that was the intent as well. The director did not try to pretend that it was something else.The theme is about some kids wanting to get into college by any means and how they land into trouble and then get out of it. It was fun to watch it. One of the better stuff from Bollywood in quite a while." 
" FUKREY is pure Delhi cast at their best..!!","Our movie revolves around four male leads. Hunny & Choocha(some people will know what 'choocha' means in the "Other" sense are the ones who drive the basic plot of this flick. Choocha is our dreamer, & Hunny is the decoder of the very dreams Choocha has on daily basis. What do they do of those dreams? They come out with a numbers & names of the local lottery tickets. Yes, its bit unrealistic, but apart from this every bit of the movie falls in place. Moving ahead we're introduced with two of our other leads, Zafar(a struggling) musician with a strained love relation & Lali(Played by Manjot Singh, one of my favorite actors now a days) who's trying to get admission in his girlfriends college. There's one common problem that troubles all of them, Money. The four of them try and make it big for themselves & invest in Hunny-Choocha Dream & win plan, with the help of a lady don, Bholi Punjaban played brilliantly by our beloved Mother from Gangs Of Wasseypur (Richa Chadda), who provides them with initial investment for the scheme while keeping something valuable from them as a guarantee. The four of them find themselves in deep deep Sh*t, when their plan goes wrong thanks to Choocha(Anything more about it will spoil it for you). Things go Haywire at payback time. With police & gundas on their tail, we find ourselves engaged with the lead cast and the movie works well because we start caring about them. A few sub plots though unnecessary, provide a little warmth to the movie, like the one of Hunny's love affair. Talking about the Pros of the movie its the acting skills displayed by the whole cast. Manjot Singh as usual is awesome, Pulkit Samrat is charming & doesn't overdo his character(He's not knew to acting with a TV soap & a Hindi feature film already to his name), Zafar played by Ali Fazal is done with mediocrity(for those who are wondering where they have seen this fellow before, he's the suicidal boy in 3 Idiots. Richa Chadda has time & always proved her credibility as an actress, and does a fair job. But most of the people going to see this movie or already seen the movie will give a special mention to Varun Sharma, who drives the movies funny quotient all along and does it brilliantly. The film's special mention goes to a intellectual beggar(don't know his name), who's time and again keeps popping up & ends on a high note. Overall this movie brings fresh air, almost like Kai Po Che a few months back, and packs wholesome 2.5 hrs of entertainment. The editing need to be more sophisticated with a few unnecessary scenes in between, like the Mata Jagrata scene in the end to be on of the few. Its a Must Watch from my side." 
" It has a few weak points but who cares when the film keeps you entertained throughout, so go for it.","To be honest, this is a wicked kind of film which has an almost non- sense storyline without anything great to reveal and many objectionable insertions in the script too, wrongly representing the younger brigade of the country in a debatable manner. But still it somehow manages to keep you entertained throughout with its shining performances, witty dialogues and hilarious sequences taken straight from the real life which collectively turn it into a winner in the end and you forget about anything else to put the objection for.Talking about the negative points of the film first, FUKREY has a wafer thin plot as far as the script is concerned and that too, a highly unconvincing one where everyone is just chasing a weird dream of a chubby boy giving them a winning lottery number every morning. Further its weak plot has been stretched too long just to add more amusing scenes in the narration which drops the pace post intermission and then it also ends on a very uninspiring note. Anyhow the good news is that the merits of the film score way above its weaker points and that is why you cannot condemn the film just for the sake of doing it. Therefore if one is willing to ignore all these preventable flaws, then FUKREY is truly capable of giving you a lot more than expected and you are sure going to enjoy watching it in the theaters along with your school or college group without any doubt.Mentioning the strong plus points of FUKREY, first of all I was frankly quite surprised to realize that this was from the same director, Mrighdeep Singh Lamba, who earlier gave us a complete non-performer film called TEEN THAY BHAI. Secondly, from the last 5-6 years, Bollywood directors seem to be in complete love with DELHI, its popular lingo used in the small localities and Punjabish style of living, famous all over. Working on the similar lines, FUKREY also makes a noticeable use of the same ambiance and thus has a good share of Punjabi abuses too in its funny dialogues.In short, the writing here is the biggest strength of the film with real life instances used exactly like we all see in the school & college campuses in Delhi. For example it's a blunt truth that there is a cruel discrimination practiced among the regular and correspondence students in Delhi University from decades. Similarly, almost all the colleges have a strong character of a gatekeeper who doesn't let others come into the premises and is supposed to have a good power on your right to enter through that gate as per his will. Besides, many well conceived sequences are also a sure shot winner in the film (especially for the residents of Delhi & NCR),which include the one featuring the legendary Narender Chanchal's famous tracks being sung in a Jagaran and Manjot's repeated scenes with a dirty beggar. But apart from this flawless realistic writing, FUKREY also shapes up well due to its perfect casting, instantly winning your hearts with their respective acts.In totality, the film belongs to three boys Varun Sharma, Pulkit Samrat, Manjot Singh and Richa Chaddha alone, who carry the film on their shoulders right till the end and rarely give you some dull moments only in the second half. Where the viewers are simply going to love Varun posing as CHOOCHA, they are immensely going to enjoy watching Pulkit & Manjot together as the ring leaders. Particularly FUKREY should ideally become the much needed jumping board for Pulkit, after his last year's average flick BITTOO BOSS, whereas Manjot is going to find it too hard coming out of his fixed image of doing similar roles, one after another since OYE LUCKY LUCKY OYE (2008). However a related truth remains that despite doing all similar kind of acts, Manjot still very gently manages to make his own mark and doesn't seem to be repetitive. On the other hand, Ali Faizal is the weakest link in the team but then he couldn't do much, since his character was specifically written in that form only in the script. Post intermission, the film gets a new life with Richa Chaddha entering as "Bholi Punjaban" which actually hides it major flaw of having no interesting storyline smartly. Richa works real hard to be terrific in her 'out of the box' character and she also succeeds in her attempt largely. But still her portrayal remains uneven in the various scenes and also I didn't find any Punjabi dialogues spoken by a character given the name of "Bholi Punjaban". Playing the love interests, Priya Anand looks gorgeous in all her lovable scenes along with Pulkit and Vishakha impresses a lot as the Accounts teacher. Last but not the least, Pankaj Tripathi plays the gatekeeper's role just brilliantly and holds them all together before intermission. Musically, Ram Sampat composes some good tracks which have been used very intelligently in the film and you don't mind watching them played in their shorter versions like "Ambarsariya" . Yet songs do add to the unnecessary length of the film which should have been avoided to keep it more focused and sharp. Background score maintains the uplifting tempo rightly and DOP captures the essence of Delhi lanes well.In all, FUKREY is a young film with a sole motive of offering the viewers a good time in the theater along with their friends and its great to see such kind of 'Star-less' initiatives backed by reputed production houses like Excel. The film does have its weak points but they all take a back seat when it keeps providing the much needed entertainment factor right till the climax in a continuous mode. Yes with a healthier storyline it could have been much better but nevertheless is quite enjoyable in its present form too, so go for it and Enjoy!" 
" Of Missed Opportunities and Unrealistic Goals","Rating: 3/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)It aims to be another "Dil Chahta Hai" or a "Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara". The glitch is that it tries to rise beyond the limitations of its script with a bunch of actors who are likable and competent performers, but not brilliant artists and bonafide moviestars. Furthermore, the direction though effective, is not astute or shrewd enough to transform a light- hearted screenplay into a memorable film. While *beep* does have some endearing scenes and crackling dialogs, there are also an equal amount of scenes and dialogs that seem puzzled, forced, and deliberately contrived. At the end of the day, its the effervescent, versatile, and gorgeous Richa Chadda who seamlessly steps in to save the day in her somewhat restricted role. Her abrasive lingo and unabashedly brash attitude serves as a perfect antidote to the clueless foursome's pleasantly goofy but sometimes annoying display. Perhaps, if the makers had decided to churn the film within the limitations of the script and talent on offer, it might have been a more entertaining prospect. Sometimes, less too can be better."
