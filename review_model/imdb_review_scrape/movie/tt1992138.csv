" Better than The Telugu version!!","Yashwardhan (John Abraham) is a tough police officer working for the narcotics control bureau. He keeps bumping into a social worker Maya (Genelia D'Souza) often, and eventually falls in love with her. On job front, he kills a drug lord Anna (Mukesh Rishi). Anna's brother Vishnu (Vidyut Jammwal) kills Yash's team member to avenge his brothers death, and is after the rest of the team. The movie ends with an wrestle fight between Yash and Vishnu.Frankly, I liked it better than the Telugu 'Gharshana' according to the story line. The Telugu one was a drag in the second half, but this one had better screenplay and left out lot of unnecessary senti crap. Acting wise, Tamil 'Kaakha Kaakha' wins the trophy hands down. Both John and Genelia could have performed better. Music is a plus. Overall, a gory but neat film, and a decent watch.For the entire review, please visit: http://sasikanth.blogspot.com/2011/10/movie-review-force.html" 
" Thumbs up for action Abraham & team force","On the whole, FORCE is an engrossing story of vendetta and the execution of the material makes it stand out in the crowd. The film has the requisite amount of zing and force, so essential for action movies that talk of heroism. If you are looking for a sensible fun action thriller film with substance, FORCE should most definitely figure on your agenda. Recommended! Watch it for the hot chemistry between the lead actors,the super performance by the villain and the beef cake JOHN ABRAHAM who puts in his best muscle forward ;)Genelia is strikingly sweet and subdued. I genuinely feel that Genelia's an under-rated actress, who's capable of delivering if given an opportunity. Note the sequence when she proposes to John. It's a difficult sequence which Genelia carries off so well. Besides, the on- screen chemistry between John and Genelia is infectious. The villain, portrayed by newcomer Vidyut Jammwal, is a worthy opponent, who is the proverbial Evil pitted against Good. His persona is striking and his performance, excellent. This guy is here to stay and his performance will be talked-about when the movie hits the screens." 
" Good movie, but could have been better","I watched the Telugu version of this movie (Gharshana, starring Venkatesh and Asin). I liked the telugu movie for action scenes and was curious to see the bollywood treatment. It was not any better than the telugu version, both had their drag elements in the first half.Heard from many ( including some reviews here) that the Tamil version Kaakha Kaakha is the best of three. Got to watch that.Khwabo Khwabi is a good song ('Uyiren Uyiren' in tamil sounds so much better, may be becoz I heard that first years ago).Overall John's performance is good, Genelia is cute ( story did not offer her much to do so can't blame her) but the Villain impresses at every scene. What I like about the villain in this movie is that he does not waste time, do your job and leave. No emotional dialogues between villain and hero (who is not tired of the typical dialogue fight between the duo before actual fight begins)." 
" Fatigue","This movie pulled me to cinema theater as it is promoted as action movie and I am badly waiting for Hindi action movies.So, Movie starts as good flick but after 15 minutes it gets monotonous. I listened whistles on john Abraham's body and tattoos and when he threw the pulsar 150CC bike on goon. But that action can be predicted as choreographed and not so realistic.BTW. The main problem is camera use, in action scenes the camera guy moves the camera and no actual blows and kicks are visible. This is main problem.Love story is unwanted and only increases the length. This is main problem and annoying. Sometimes it becomes typical Hindi movie. Genelia doesn't die suddenly in 2 bullets which are shot by putting the gun at her abdomen. Hahaha! John Abraham is very good and I've never seen such powerful actor ever in Hindi cinema.The villain: WOW! much better than John, He is tough guy and very impressive. You will have villain's image in your mind but john's body is best and his bike lifting and last time stunt but he cannot be remembered for his performance.Not up to the mark but last hour show let you forget all worst and when you come out of theater you say the movie is good...This could be good but camera man should know his stuff...." 
" Entertaining!","Force directed by Nishikant Kamath is entertaining! The movie has a medium-paced first-half and a solid second half.The movie is a remake of Tamil-hit Kaakha Kaakha.Story:- Critically wounded and lying unconscious in a Mumbai hospital, ACP Yashvardhan(John Abraham) of the Narcotics Control Bureau reflects on his life and his love-affair with Maya(Genelia D Souza). With the assistance of the Commissioner as well as his colleagues, Atul(Mohnish Bahl), Kamlesh (Kamlesh Sawant) and Mahesh Pandey, and an informer, Arvind Shetty, he was able to apprehend drug-dealers in Kutch, Gujarat; Jalandhar, Punjab, as well as in Himachal Pradesh. Unknowingly, he paved the way for Vasu Anna Reddy(Mukesh Rishi) to become the sole drug-dealer and invite his Mombasa-based brother, Vishnu (Vidyut Jamwal), to join him. An encounter with the team kills Vasu, and some of the team gets suspended. A vengeful Vishnu decides to target the entire police unit as well as their respective families, and vows that he will not rest until he has killed them all. He starts with brutally killing Mahesh and his wife, Rachna, and then abducts Atul's wife, Swati - with a motive of forcing the former to do away with the remainder of this police team.The story is similar to those of RGV-crime movies.The direction is fine.The music is plain.The action is top-notch.In fact,the movie gets quite violent especially towards the end.The dialogs are well-worded.Performances:- John Abraham is excellent.Debutant Vidyut Jamwal steals the show with his splendid performance.Genelia D Souza is fine.Mohnish Bahl and Mukesh Rishi are good in their respective roles.Sandhya Mridul is perfect.Kamlesh Sawant is funny.On the whole FORCE is a one-time watch!" 
" "BOUND BY DUTY,UNLEASHED BY LOVE",what a movie must watch!!","thumbs up for FORCE and john!!!! .what a great and amazing movie,completely international standard. i don't know about telugu version but this is the one and i think bollywood made that type of movie after a long time ,really appreciated movie ,story ,acting ,action,every thing is perfect and of course GENELIA so beautiful and showed every effort in this movie .ACP YASHVARDHAN s role suits him(john abraham) perfectly he is a muscle man in this movie and i'm agree with the statement "BOUND BY DUTY, UNLEASHED BY LOVE". OVERALL movie is not a spoiler ,good action movie specially the climax is very good ,must watch movie of this year" 
" Full of Action yet Upholds Spirit of Love","'Force', the title itself gives us the idea that the movie is packed with 'action' and yes it is. But it is certainly not devoid of love, the strength and weakness of humans in general. In fact director Nishikant Kamat strikes a good balance between action and love which is well presented by the actors. Being a re-make of Tamil hit 'Kaakha Kaakha' the movie manages to fairly grip the audience and a fine attempt I must say.John has indeed chosen a perfect role. Watch the movie, you will know why I'am saying this. The role of a narcotic cop in 'Force' is probably the best role John has ever performed. His work-outs, his interaction with the real-life narcotic cops has indeed paid-off. His brawny appearance impresses and goes well with his role in the movie.Free spirited Genelia was too cute and charming in the movie. Her pretty act captivates the audience and a perfect bollywood choice for Jyothika's character in Kaakha Kaakha.Vidyut who plays an intelligent villain was exceptional. He too flaunts his muscles and did justice to his character.THIS MOVIE CARRIES HIGH ACTION AND SOME LOVE ......... OVERALL FORCE IS A BRILLIANT MOVIE.........WHICH TIES THE AUDIENCES VERY WELL TILL THE END....... I MUST SAY THAT THE CLIMAX OF "FORCE" IS Applaud WORTHY....." 
" Surely Watchable !","Yes that's true. This movie unexpectedly does really well. My expectation before watching the movie (from Rumors & storyline): May be the effect of Dabangg or Bodyguard, I was expecting lots of South kind of action.But when I watch the movie, no scene was extreme, really thanks for the action director for not making it south like. & When you have muscular hero & villain, u can expect lots of action between them.OK as usual, lets start with review.Why to see: Story: Though a kind of regular story, but good direction makes it watchable. Action: Good & watchable action, no dabangg & bodyguard ! John's acting: For the first time I like John's ACTING, & truly he scores !Why not: Nothing that wrong with the movie. so u can watch it.Bare: Genelia's acting, those who like/love her, can ignore this." 
" "Force" Movie Review - a NO nonsense movie- go watch it","I have seen many Hindi remakes of south films before but "Force" stands out as it sticks to the original script as far as possible. I feel its not fair to compare the original version with a remake as it will be like comparing apples with oranges and hence i wouldn't make an attempt. The movie doesn't deviate from its core script to provide an extra item song or stunt just to make the audience happy nor does it inject lot of unwanted twists and unrealistic stunts. It stands by its script and delivers a good entertainer. Even though the promos projected the movie as more of an action film, romance plays a major part in the movie and over shadows the action element. Unlike other action movies where the romance is just to support some song sequences in Force you can feel the romance when the lead pair falls for each other. As John described during the movie promo the action sequences are merciless and very Raw. Overall its a no nonsense movie which tries to tell the story of a cop in a way which is close to reality without loosing the commercial elements required for a film. Go watch it if you like romantic action movies and you wont be disappointed.Read full review at www.movierecycle.com" 
" Time-Pass!","A remake of Gautham Menon's successful 2003 Tamil film, Kaakha Kaakha, 'Force' is Time-Pass Entertainment. It has a fairly engaging script, along-with good action, good visuals & impressive direction working for it. 'Force' is about a dutiful cop who chases the capture of a dreaded gangster. Let me clarify: 'Force' is not meant for the faint-hearted. The excessive violence, especially in the second-hour, is sure to put off the illy-livered. In terms of Script, this recent Action-Fare, has some captivating moments & good stunts going for it. Ritesh Shah's Screenplay begins superbly, but dips considerably in the second-hour, which, honestly, doesn't quite do the trick. Also, the loud & depressing climax, is not up-to the mark. Nishikanth Kamath's Direction, is impressive. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are perfect. Stunts are good. Music by Harris Jayaraj, is soulful.Performance Wise: John Abraham suits the part, and does reasonably well. Genelia D'Souza is her usual self. Vidyut Jamwal is terrific as the ruthless villain. He is the scene-stealer here. Mohnish Bahl is in form. Raj Babbar supports well. Mukesh Rishi scores. Kamlesh Sawant, Ameet Gaur, Sandhya Mridul & Anaitha Nair lend support. On the whole, 'Force' is a time-pass fare." 
" Not half as good as Kaakha Kaakha!","This film is inspired by the Surya starrer "Kaakha kaakha", and the film definitely goes along those lines. But it lacks the same intensity and punch that Kaakha Kaakha had.Story is about an NCB cop who gets targeted by a psychic but efficient drug lord, who tries to terrorize the cop and his colleagues and their loved ones for revenge.The film is too fast moving, from action to love to drama, as though the makers had limited time and they were trying to fast forward the Tamil version. Some scenes are bogus, songs are not at all melodious, not even Khwaabon Khwaabon, which is the only track that is dubbed from the Tamil film. They have not copied it 100 % ditto; there are variations between both films, but this is somewhat bogus.Some action scenes are noteworthy, and the storyline is good(but of course it's not authentic!). Vidyut Jamal's acting is noteworthy.You can watch Force, but you are better off watching Kaakha Kaakha instead." 
" repulsive force","Contrite, clichéd, awful.. Same old "Once Upon a time there was a security personnel" theme.. The cast seemed to be an interesting mix of talent and has-been.. John was Good, Genelia below average but the débutant Vidyut Jamwal was Outstanding ..The only good thing about this movie is probably the stunts ..It was clean but then again at times monotonous.Anyway, in summary, don't think that it's so bad it'll be entertaining, because it isn't (if you want something like that, try 'Dumb Maaro Dumb')It's horrific to the point of disbelief, whilst remaining incredibly dull throughout." 
" A Nutshell Review: Force","Of late I have enjoyed the slew of action films coming out from Bollywood, especially the cop ones thanks to Salman Khan's highly successful Dabangg that had energized the genre and allowed the likes of Abhishek Bachchan, Ajay Devgn and now John Abraham to follow suit in playing no nonsense tough cops who talk with their guns and fists and do not hesitate meeting fire with fire against their villains. Sure you will raise your eyebrows at the tactics and techniques used, but while some of the earlier films had a tinge of exaggeration in their action sequences, Force was all serious.John Abraham stars as the hulking giant ACP Yash of the narcotics bureau who had spent the most parts of his life undercover and busting drug lords and their syndicates. We see how, without the baggage of close friends and family, he gets to do what he does best since there's pretty much nothing anyone can do to find an emotional sweet spot in which to exploit the inherent weakness of man when he has a loved one or family to look after. That status quo changes when he meets with Maya (Genelia D'Souza) with whom he starts off on the wrong foot with, but slowly but surely it took them an entire half of a film before the intermission to fall in love.Which dragged out the first half as it tried extremely hard to balance the romantic moments, and that of the action ones with ACP Yash assembling his own crack team of buddies to go after the major drug lords in the city, before realizing that they were indirectly helping the meanest drug syndicate of them all, run by the maniacal Vishnu (Vidyut Jamwal) to re-enter the market and become the de-facto monopoly on illicit drug supplies since there's essentially no competition. And as a pre-emptive strike, Vishnu comes up with plans to rid Yash and his men with family and loved ones no longer being sacred and untouchable as he goes all out to get even.Told largely in a flashback nature since the film opens with Yash being busted out of a window fighting for dear life before being rushed to hospital, Force came off as a mixed bag, while at times trying to be gritty and cold, but let down by a rather clunky delivery especially during emotional scenes which were implausible to have happened, especially the final scene involving Yash, Maya and Vishnu, with the audience made to wonder where Vishnu is and what he was doing while waiting for the lovers to say what they needed to say.John Abraham with mean tattoo, shades and attitude was probably the only reason to watch Force, a remake of the Tamil movie Kaakha Kaakha directed by Nishikanth Kamath. Here his buffed body naturally becomes the talk of the town as there were many engineered scenes where he just had to take his top off, and the final battle was somewhat like a hats off to Salman Khan in any typical action role were valid reasons to become shirtless was almost always due to the villain. Genelia D'Souza role as Maya was basically to look good and provide justification why ACP Yash would choose to plunge headlong into a relationship when he was already married to his job, and their romance really took its own sweet time to simmer, and Vidyut Jamwal could only do so much given his limited screen time, only managing to reinforce he's such a badass every time he chooses to exercise punishment on the cops.Force had lacked what its contemporaries in the genre had - plenty of fun, and a unique gimmick for a selling point. It had taken itself way too seriously, and with only its production rumour of John Abraham really marrying Genelia D'Souza on set no thanks to the actual rites being chanted and followed, may bring in the crowds and put bums on seats. A pretty bland effort overall, which is a pity since the tough cop genre had built up a strong momentum only for Force to actually deliver a whimper and derail that effort." 
" Another South remake","It's sort of become a trend, few weeks after Singham released, came FORCE, Another tamil remake, this time of Kaakha Kaakha(2003) which had Surya and Jyothika. That film was a great film and a hit however this tries to copy it and add some changes but overall result isn't too great. The romance track isn't as convincing as the original,The much hyped John's bike stunt is good This time the change is John is made a narcotics officer in disguise The film mostly otherwise follows the original. The clash between Vidyut and John is good but predictability does set in, even the end is well handled but lacks the edge of the originalDirection by Nishikant Kamat is good but not compared to Govind Menon Music is good the song Khwabon Khwabon which is a rehash with the same singers from the original is good rest songs are okayJohn Abraham plays his part well though not as convincing as Surya Genelia is too sugarcoated compared to Jyothika but is okay Vidyut Jamwal makes a good debut Mukesh Rishi is as usual, Raj Babbar is okay Mohinish Behl, Sandhya Mridul and rest are good" 
" Nothing you haven't seen before but watch it for its menacing villain!","Nishikant Kamant's directorial debut "Mumbai Meri Jaan" was quite a good movie and with that nothing short of a masterpiece was expected from him in his next outing. Although this movie is no more than your standard fare and is in fact a remake of the tamil movie "Kaakha Kaahkha" but action is always a difficult genre to deal with, which in current circumstances has been made additionally difficult with the success of awful movies like Singham and Dabbang 2... so in that context this is much better. The movie mostly suffers from a predictable storyline, an annoying Genelia D'Souza (wonder why they didn't simply call her Genelia in the movie since she is totally herself and not so charming at that!) and weak execution at times. However, had it been (thankfully not) the likes of Rohit Shetty, Anil Sharma or the lot handling direction this movie would had been another crazy airborne action mess..but Kamant shows commendable courage in giving its strong villain in newcomer Vidyut Jamwal ample screen time ...sometimes at the cost of its main protagonist John Abraham who at his end does an OK job (I never expect great acting from John anyway!)largely helped by a beefed up physique! WATCH OUT FOR: Vidyut Jamwal Conclusion: Watch this movie to enjoy action as its should be i.e. intense and violent!....6.7/10!" 
" I liked it","I thought force was great, but i do not recommend it for people who don't speak the Hindi language and just watch it with subtitles, because It really takes away from the movie.Force isn't something new and is a remake. It follows the story of a ruthless cop who falls in love, then the bad guy who wants revenge and threatens him and his love. Unlike other action films in Bollywood like dabangg, bodyguard and singham it is a bit smarter and the fight sequences are SUPERB, best fights EVER and they put you on the edge of your seat.I think they could of added a bit of suspense with villain and the hero but its still good. One other problem is the villains motive, Vidyut Jamwal does a great job but he's motive could of been better to make it more convincing. John does a good job so does Genelia and so does Vidyut as the villain, so performance wise it is also good.all in all great action sequences, simple story. Watch it if you like good action movies."
