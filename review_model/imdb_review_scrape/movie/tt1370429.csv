" 99 is a success!","99 is a success! First time mainstream directors DK and Raj pull off with great intelligence this smart witty new age comedy. The movie engrosses you from the opening scene with a rip roaring chase that builds upon the background of this masterful story line. The plot takes on so many twists and turns that viewers will be kept guessing throughout the film. The beauty of this story is that it weaves fiction into fact using the India's cricket scandals back in 1999 as the background scene. It is intelligent, smart, and entertaining.The casting is superb with Boman Irani, Mahesh Manjrekar and Kuber Mistry. Boman Irani is perfect in his portrayal as an addicted gambler. It is easy for the viewer to feel the full plight and depth of his situation as he digs himself into deeper and deeper holes. Kuber Mistry steels the comic scene of this movie with his hilarious antics. His dialogs are delivered with expert precision that it is hard to believe he is only acting the part. Expect to see this actor in many more movies to come. Kunal Khemu and Cyrus Broacha, the heroes of the film, are pure fun and their characters get into a sticky situation from the start of the movie. Both draw the viewer in making you root for them to succeed in their plight in the end no matter what happens. I do not want to ruin the ending of this movie, but be prepared for some surprises. Trust me, as strange as it sounds, they will have you rooting against Indian cricketers too.99 is a solid film that should do well in the box office. It is definitely not a movie that should be missed. I rate it a thumbs up and give it 5/5." 
" 99 is a trend-setter!",""Chakka kisine Maara...Paisa kisine haara" -- haunts me even after a day of watching this super thriller...I could so well relate to Rahul -- the Hansie Cronje, if you will, of the movie -- A character you could only pity. Boman for me was the highlight of the movie.Cricket is such an integral part of the movie that you have a 'reel' Sachin with a 'reel' Dravid (although a fatso) -- Keeps Sachin good company throughout the movie -- much like the Sachin, Dravid partnerships that we are accustomed to on the cricket field. Kunal is impressive and seems to have taken his acting to the next level from his previous movies. Cyrus evokes enough laughter to keep you engaged. Soha, as her role demands, was very suave and subdued.Import-Export business king Kuber is another highlight -- his one-liners are bound to become popular in bollywood cinema in the years to come -- "Checking"..."Cut Again"..."Give Respect" etc..much like Vivek in Flavors, if you remember, -- "You Grow Up"...Accompanying him is "Dimple", taking me back to "Michael Madana Kama Rajan's" Kamal-Bheem combo.Talking of one-liners, there's no dearth of those in the movie -- be it AMG leaving a 'message' after the 'beep' OR the wannabe in the hotel lobby threatening to buy the 5-star hotel or the popular theory about how cell phones would hurt your entire body, heck I even liked the dude on the street giving TV interview of what he saw of the culprits.Another aspect of the movie was the subtlety with which certain things are shown -- be it the kids flaunting their bounty hunt on the road or Rahul's "oh!" at the fall of a wicket on a match he bet on, while in the Y2k meeting room -- the directors quality of letting small events tell a story of its own shows up as a highlight.Although not having songs interrupt the story flow is a welcome change -- having listened to the music album, you almost wish that you see the full version of the songs play out..most people stay in the theater through the credits because of the "What's up" song...come to think of it...shouldn't't "Whats up"? song be the opening credit as a way of the débutant directors saying Hello to Bollywood? may be they are setting us up for a sequel, who knows...LoL..Background score is slick and cocky and suits the mood..This "99" is bound to cross Lara's 400 and become a "trend-setter" for future Bollywood generation." 
" Intelligent, Smart and Entertaining!","99 is a success! First time main steam directors DK and Nidimoru pull off with great intelligence this smart witty new age comedy. The movie engrosses you from the opening scene with a rip roaring chase that builds upon the background of this masterful story line. The plot takes on so many twists and turns that viewers will be kept guessing throughout the film. The beauty of this story is that it weaves fiction into fact using the India's cricket scandals back in 1999 as the background scene. It is intelligent, smart, and entertaining. The casting is superb with Boman Irani, Mahesh Majrekar and Kuber Mistry. Boman Irani is perfect in his portrayal as an addicted gambler. It is easy for the viewer to feel the full plight and depth of his situation as he digs himself into deeper and deeper holes. Kuber Mistry steels the comic scene of this movie with his hilarious antics. His dialogs are delivered with expert precision that it is hard to believe he is only acting the part.

" One of the best this year!","When you have an original idea and the execution is professional and care is taken to give the audience something to laugh or ponder or get thrilled, you have a top notch entertainer. And 99 for me is one of the best this year and possibley in the last few years. And to add to this the cast hit bulls yes. Even though the cast is not attractive on paper because of the star crazy industry that we are unfortunately part of; once you see the film you will agree with me that the casting was perfect; and every cast person deliver what they were meant for. OK to summarise 99 I will say it is a terrific thriller and an excellent comedy. And if you think about it this combination of thriller and comedy is rare and that is exactly why I think this is one of the best Hindi films I have seen. I recommend hundred percent! Thank you" 
" Little Gem of a Movie","Right from the word go, 99 seems to be a bit 'different' !! Even the normally humdrum disclaimers that you see in the beginning of a movie ("Any resemblance to real people or events is a coincidence .. blah blah") sings a different tune for this movie – you will understand when you see it. And on hindsight, it was a fair warning. Coz nothing else about the movie – the unknown director pair of Krishna D.K. and Raj Nidimoru, the boring lead pair of Kunal Khemu (who ?) and Cryus Broacha, the cute but hardly a top-slot-actress Soha Ali Khan – nothing prepares you for the absolute blast this movie is !! Simply put – it ROCKED ! (BTW, doesn't Nidimoru sound a little Japanese ?)The movie starts in 1999, with two small-time crooks Sachin (Kunal Khemu) and Zaramud (Cyrus Broacha), on the run from the police. They hotwire a car and try to escape, only to lose control of the vehicle and smash it into a truck, then a lamppost and all sorts of other things – completely wrecking it. And to their luck, the car belongs to local bhai AGM (Sanjay Manjrekar) – to pay off for the car, they start working for him. AGM is bigtime into satta and has many outstanding debts to him. He dispatches our lead duo to Delhi to extort money from a non-paying gambling junkie Rahul (Boman Irani). All this is only the first 10 minutes of the movie.The movie is named so because it signifies just one short of a century – and all the characters in our keep missing their mark in life, just by a little bit. 99 is full of comic twists and turns – AND cricket jokes !! You could probably classify this as a comic heist/gangster story I suppose, but it wouldn't be doing this movie complete justice. The closest to this movie is probably last year's Abhay-Deol-starrer Oye Lucky Lucky Oye. Intelligent humour and lot of fun being poked at the city of Delhi itself – there are lot of similarities in the two movies. But story lines are very different.Performance was standout across the board – Kunal Khemu, Boman Irani, Cyrus Broacha, Mahesh Manjrekar, Amit Mistry (Kuber), Vinod Khanna – and everybody else. Soha Ali Khan & Simone Singh didn't have much to do, but Soha looked rather cute – and both do their parts very satisfactorily. Mahesh Manjrekar continues to shine in comic roles – though I think his character would have better been named ATM instead of AGM. Boman was good as usual and Amit Mistry as Kuber was a hoot, to say nothing of Dimpy !! But the star was Kunal Khemu – the guy CAN act !! Not that I am complaining about this movie, but he should be getting better roles ! And Cyrus Broacha was a surprise too – he wasn't as over the top as I imagined he would be.Being released in the middle of the multiplex-producers dispute will probably help this movie, as compared to being released in a normal schedule, competing with 5 other movies in a week. So yes, definitely go for 99 - it's a little gem of movie that you shouldn't miss.I regularly write about movies at http://bombaycinephile.blogspot.com" 
" One of the best films this year...no doubt!","For once bollywood delivers on what it promises. It's a very slick film that tells a pretty unique story in a refreshing style that is almost alien to Indian cinema. Every single aspect of the film is top notch. It has plenty of good humor with some very smart ideas that make the entire ride highly entertaining. I didn't have any expectations from the film, mainly because of the actors in the film but having watched the film, I have to agree that each and every one of the actors did a top notch performance. But above the all the screenplay and narration of the film is superb! Something you hardly ever get to see in Hindi films, ever. I think it's the debut of the director. Great job !" 
" 99 not out","The film looks interesting from the outset, when the makers claim that they believe the incidents in film are real. And an interesting way of opening credits only adds to curiosity.Film starts with a funny chase and kunal khemu starts to narrate the story. A story of 2 small time crooks and how they get into big time troubles. The film traverses a unique genre of comedy thriller. It keeps you at the edge of the seats, but at the same time makes sure that the edge never hurts, with enough humor spread all over.The storyline is spread over 2 cities of Bombay and Delhi in the year 1999. The film uses a real life scandalous case as the backdrop. (Though it no suspense, still its best left untold what scandal they've used). Director has taken care of minute details to make the story set in year 1999, like mobile incoming was charged, Clinton's India visit, 20-20 cricket still being a wild idea and even the dollar exchange rates. Also the essence of 2 cities is intact. Watch out the scene when Cyrus and Kunal describe why they don't want to go to Delhi. It's simply hilarious.Kunal Khemu is slowly coming to its own. Cyrus could have had a few more lines to say, though he is great in whatever he is doing. Soha Ali is under utilized. Vinod Khanna is neat and Boman Irani is in form as ever.It's a refreshing break, both from some unimaginative comedies we've seen in recent past and the hiatus caused in release of Hindi films in cinemas.Its sweet little comedy, thriller, romantic, fun film. Go refresh yourselves. Have some good time." 
" 99 - A joy ride","Imagine I asked you to describe what your life was like a decade ago... Right, me neither - so instead, Imagine I asked you to make up a story of your life based on key events that happened to you 10 years ago but fill in the rest as you like... Now imagine how much harder it would be if I asked that the story you were creating also had to bridge to the current day events back then It is a daunting task and one which the writers of 99 have done with flair and function. The script is whip-smart in the way it combines popular trends (cell phones, bhojpuri movies, the onset of cafes) of the time with the news making events (y2k, cricket match fixing) of the time to narrate a truly innovative story. All this while adding twists and turns to the main plot that will keep you buckled to your seat for the 2hr ride.The casting was genius - Especially true of, Soha Ali Khan (as the girl next door that you want to take home to mom) Kunal Khemu (as 'NOT the bigger-than-thou hero who doesn't need your rooting for him to make a century'), Amit Mistry (as the lil guy with a big stick - aka dimple) and Boman Irani (as the most frustrating, gambler-husband-who-you-love-nevertheless ever). Kunal is a natural born actor and in Amit, a star has just been born.Why you will love it : Sharp dialogues, sharper delivery, excellent acting all round, awesome cinematography, fantastic music Why you might settle for liking it : The movie is in a genre that is new to Bollywood - "What, I don't have to be awed by the hero's machismo and the heroine's svelte body?", "What, the lead characters are the underdogs that I will want to root for, rather than supermen who drive Lamborghinis and live in palaces?", "what, I will hope that the hero escapes from the bad guy rather than making mincemeat of the villains face?". The genre is called a 'crime caper' but 99, refuses to be boxed neatly into a category and insists on being a comedy-historical fiction-and-much-moreThis movie wont change your life - don't expect to leave the movie inspired and moved. It will be more like you stepped off a roller coaster ride and you want to go back to the end of the line again. Ladies, It would be like eating a perfectly whipped chocolate mousse - Enjoy!" 
" 99 is the new century!","A brave and an honest attempt. Its indeed a fresh concept which deserves to be applauded. Easy pitfall for the Gen-X for the film-makers to go overboard and end up with a product thats shares similarity to a text- book. In simple words it ends up being a GM fruit/ veggie. The director duo manage to retain the natural "flavour" to the proceedings.Ө Kunal Khemu:: He was good in most parts and does need to polish his skills. The character was a bit "too posh" for his background. Ө Cyrus:: Either his character was bad or Cyrus is a bad actor (owing to which his role got massacred on the editing table). Regardless, should have taken inspiration from Circuit.Ө Soha:: As usual, nothing was expected out of her or the character. So its "status-quo". Neha-Pooja reference was good.Ө Boman Irani:: Well can be safely said that the entire movie rests on him and he manages to bear the weight effortlessly. The name Rahul was a bit too modern for the character.Ө Simone Singh:: The role could have been safely purged from the plot. There is nothing the character contributes to the storyline.Ө Vinod Khanna:: Well, what can be said of Mr. Suave. He is suave in the role.Ө Mahesh Manjrekar::Infuses life into the character owing to which manages to draw good laughs. And very authentic look indeed.Ө Amit Mistry:: Make way for this fresh talent, he is surely to stay and give tough fight to Rajpal Yadav (similarity in size too!).99 can also be classified as a period film as it attempts to recreate the 1999-2000 scene (mobile, betting, Clinton's visit & the out-of-the- box idea of Coffee shop). There are a few goofs which can be safely ignored. Clearly evident is the inspiration from Pulp Fiction. Gentlemen the "rabbit-out-of-hat" is no doubt Tarantino'ism.When the audience were practically dying of starvation owing to the multiplexes strike, wonder why "99" wasn't lapped up as manna from heaven. Beats me!Bottomline:: This John Doe deserves more recognition." 
" I have a theory about films... they should all be THIS much fun!!","The first question I have for Krishna DK, Raj Nidimoru and Anupam Mittal after watching "99 (2009)" is: "Why did you starve us for 6 long years since your last epic "Flavors (2003)"?".Like their previous work, "99" is pure brilliance with a tight plot, jokes that work and pop-culture references that make you go "A-ha!". In other words, a MUST WATCH. The packed house at PVR on a weekday late-night show is testimony to that.Kunal Khemu is an under-rated actor in the mould of Abhay Deol. Luckily, the latter has found his groove with the last couple of releases. Kunal is still stuck at 99 (pun intended), despite excellent nuanced performances in some excellent but forgotten films like "SuperStar (2008)". He has an easy charm and superb comic timing. At the same time, his vulnerable eyes poke through your heart during the tragic scenes. I really hope he breaks the jinx of successful child actors (like Urmila Matondkar, probably the only success so far).This movie also enjoys the acting talent of powerhouses like Boman Irani (who started in similar Indy films like "Let's Talk (2002)" but now needs no introduction), Mahesh Manjrekar, Amit Mistry (a bonafide superstar at Bombay's Prithvi Theatres) and Cyrus Broacha. All these guys have significant theatre experience and it shows in their comic timing, body language and diction. In smaller roles, the bhojpuri actor and the sidekick provide many laughs with their natural presence. Among the ladies, Soha and Simone are important to the plot but don't have any spectacular scenes where they get to shine.So here is my second question to Krishna DK, Raj Nidimoru and Anupam Mittal: "Why didn't you repeat the ravishing and very funny Pooja Kumar from Flavors, in the role of (who else?) Pooja?". She'd be so purrrfect-- and a treat to watch.The production is very well designed. The movie is set in 99-2000 and it almost feels as if that is when it was shot. Be it the film hoardings across the city (imagine "Kaho Na Pyar Hai (2000)" blocking the skyline, for chrissakes!), the mobile phone models they use, the cars they drive or their amazement at the advent of "cyber cafes"--- this could well be one of India's first period films (NOT about the Freedom Struggle)! If anything, that's one award it deserves for sure. The background score is also well used and adds to the tension/fun of the chase.As for the story itself, this is a chase/heist movie in the genre of what Guy Ritchie does. The two losers are on the run from everyone, with their IOUs adding up faster than Sachin's centuries. Their misfortunes and bravado makes for some very comic situations, without resorting to any toilet humor (well, almost) or Priyadarshan style confusion-climax. The audience kept laughing and clapping all through. Especially loved were the Bombay versus Delhi references (the cities are known for their cultural rivalry and pride). The movie is peppered with cricket metaphors, delivered in Cyrus's inimitable style. Cricket forms an important part of the plot and it is made by true lovers of the game.Even though it reminds you of many Hollywood films, it is not a copy but in their genre. This slight difference sets it apart from the 99% junk that Bollywood ends up celebrating annually with the likes of Anees Bazmee, Priyadarshan, David Dhawan and Hansal Mehta. So here's my third question for Krishna DK, Raj Nidimoru and Anupam Mittal: "Agli picture kab bana rahe ho?"" 
" Best comedy of the Year 2009","This movie bring one of the greatest reality of Cricket in Inida - Betting with sense of humor.This is one of the best comedy of year 2009. all character have played there part greatly. A 10/10.Really vary few people have seen this movie, but truly this one is paisa wasool.chemistry between Soha and Kunal working. Cyrus really need some more time to be comfortable with Camera. At times he feels uncomfortable. Kunal is improving. If you looking for good family entertainment this one is for you." 
" 99 (2009)","99 is targeted at youth and multiplex audience inspired by real life events of match fixing that happened in year 1999 that took cricket world by storm. The movie has the right script, good actors and the humor at right place, which is able to take the movie ahead especially with unconventional music and Cricket being involved. The story is about two small time goons – Sachin (Kunal Khemu) & Zaramud (Cyrus Broacha) who work for AGM (Mahesh Manjrekar), a known name in bookie world as they have to clear their long owed debt to him. The story gets candid as both Sachin and Zaramud are send to Delhi from Mumbai to bring Agm's money from Rahul (Boman Irani) who is obsessed with betting and is big time looser like Sachin & Zaramud. The trio is known to struck at 99, a step before they could make it big–time. The story moves forward as they get to know about JC (Vinod khanna), a match-fixer and the trio gets befriended seeing each others financial and sympathetic condition and agree to take a life changing bet that would clear off all their debts and make their dreams true.MY RATING: 7/10" 
" 99-Kyonki Taliya Woh Ek Run Ke Baad Hi Bajti Hai","Went into watching 99 with least expectations and was amazed with what it had to offer.The title as it suggests... the movie is setup in the year 1999 also with the protagonist who believes his life is on 99.99 is the number most characters are stuck on.. because its the century that makes it worth it.Kunal Khemu (Sachin) and Cyrus Broacha (Zaramud) are friends who work as "Line Wala"(watch the movie to understand the Terminology) and have to work for Mahesh Manjrekar(aka AGM a Bookie) against their Wills.The first half of the movie focuses on how both land up working for AGM.Boman Irani(Rahul) a gambler and a Sort of a Banker by profession gambles and loses.AGM sends Sachin and Zaramud to Delhi for recovering the money the fun begins...Now for the performances Vinod Khanna(JC-Bookie) the senior-most of the lot in a small and minuscule role is a perfect fit for JC.Soha Ali Khan(Neha) is s pretty good 5-star hotel receptionist who goes for a coffee with her guests without leaving the hotel.Now the star performers....Kunal Khemu and Cyrus Broacha steal the show with the perfect Camaraderie that just leaves you with no option but enjoy the fun.Sachin believes that The "bhojpuri" element in the movie is something that seriously adds to the humour.A any season movie and way better than most no brainer's bollywood usually comes up with ..99 portrays humour in a very real way.Kudos to the Team for making this one.Can simply say the best comedy of the last decade..and a very underrated movie. Go for 99 and feel the nostalgia that stays with you...and makes you watch it just that one more time again....Kyonki Taliya Woh Ek Run Ke Baad Hi Bajti Hai...." 
" A total laugh riot!!!","Me and my cousins just caught the movie today...and I must say, the movie left us laughing on the floor(figuratively, that is).My one and only reason to go for this one was Cyrus Broacha, and after you've seen all his antics on MTV, you think what more can he offer. But watch out for him in this one!!! Ridiculously hilarious! Be it his humongous fat-suit or his Bombay attitude in Delhi, Cyrus makes you laugh and how! Didn't really expect anything from Kunal Khemu, but he does put up a pretty good act in this one! He gels perfectly with Cyrus and the two of them give a Laurel and Hardy type of feel to it! The supporting cast does a pretty good job, too. Boman Irani eases his part as a debt-ridden common man, befriending two bumbling extortionists(Cyrus and Kunal), and on the run from more of them! Mahesh Manjrekar and Vinod Khanna too put up very realistic acts as underworld bookies and match-fixers respectively! Soha Ali Khan is not too good and not too bad, but doesn't stick out like an eye sore, thankfully! The best part of the movie is undoubtedly the slapstick comedy, hilarious situations and a very late 90's type of feel to it. Technically, I wouldn't say much, but in a time when Hindi movies are taking the off-beat theme, "99" scores a century!" 
" Magical and Euphoric","Magical and EuphoricThe latest comedy by Krishna D.K and Raj Nidimoru undoubtedly is a hit. The last time I’d watched a bollywood flick was either Fanna or Doom 2; I don’t quite recall. The following is a summary of my observation on 99The cast: More than anything else I loved the cast because of the authenticity and naturalism they brought into the movie i.e. the protagonist Kunal Khemu having the magical chemistry with Soha. On the other hand, supporting actor Syrus Broacha whom I had the chance to seeing him again after six or seven years when he hosted Love Line and Bakra on MTV. Moreover, bearing in mind that Kunal being this athletic heartthrob, Cyrus on the other hand is playing the role of a pudgy and pantomime who has been lubricated on the body making him seem something about 100 kg.The Dialogue: Next I thought the dialogue was superb: Boman Irani habitually a betting freak who gets home late at nigh and begs his wife to let him in. there’s a scene when he buys his wife a birthday present that I found both hilarious and vulpine. In parts, the inner psychological annoyance the characters have specially that of Boman’s reminds me of the similarity of disturbance the characters of Forest Whitaker’s The Air I Breathe and Tom Cruise’s Magnolia get to fight with. In my opinion, all of them deliver one single theme in a way or another.The humor: When you read about this picture on IMDb, the genre obviously is comedy. Although I think it’s tough to put a label on it because there’s crime, romance, thriller etc involved in it. There’s a task assigned for Kunal and Syrus to travel to Delhi. When they get the capital city on the way airport to hotel, all of a sudden Cyrus clamors over the cab driver “You son of a b**ch! You crossed this very circle 5 minutes ago why do you keep shuffling around the town? Why don’t we arrive in the god dame hotel? Do you think you can fleece us? "Sir mind your language. There are many similar circles in Delhi." replies taxi driverIn a word or two, 99 is very thick with ideas. Furthermore, it has a lot more to deliver e.g. topnotch music and direction and the rest of the cast: Mahesh Manjreker and Vinod Khanna who have performed their role astonishingly well. The ending is triumphant, magical and euphoric.I would rate this one 8.5/10" 
" 99/100 it deserves.","99 is an intelligent movie using 1999 cricket scandal in India during India South Africa series.The story told in an intelligent manner with good twist and turn in it which keeps you guessing all the time and you remain on the edge of the seat. And it is hard to find out weather it is facts or fiction, or say its a real fiction, whatever it was nice experience watching this modern day comedy intertwined with cricket issue.All actors performance was good, Boman and Kunal steals the show Boman is excellent as an addicted gambler. Kunal shares good chemistry with Soha, All three were good.Its a good movie a good weekend flick whose image keeps floating on your mind."
