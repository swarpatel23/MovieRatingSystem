" Yes, the cover is misleading","I was prepared to not watch this movie with my 4 year old son. It looks really lame on the cover. I was half watching, half reading until I saw the bandits. I closed my book and watched in awe as a beautiful Chinese fable unfolded on the screen. The elephants and humans don't speak to each other but they try to understand each other and everyone learns several real life lessons: Yes fighting is bad and we shouldn't do it, but sometimes you must defend your country and your family....your freedom.The blue elephant's mother tells him that fighting is bad but then when he is in the middle of a war he fights for what is important to him. This is a wonderful movie to use as a teaching tool for children who have family members in the service, to teach young children that they should not hit but that they shouldn't take a beating also....."is it worth it to get into a fist fight over a toddler toy at preschool - NO, but if someone is hurting you then you can defend yourself." It also works as a defense against adults - if a child understand bullying and tyranny they are more likely to fight against it.a wonderful movie, especially if you use it as a learning tool." 
" This is Old 2006 Thai Movie dubbed in Hindi","This is Old 2006 Thai Movie dubbed in Hindi.Akshay Kumar's Jumbo where the superstar has not just lent his voice for the central character of an elephant but also shot for an exclusive music video - 'Everything Is Gonna Be Alright'. While Percept Picture Company has proudly flashed their association with Akshay Kumar for the film and there have been (reported) talks about him being paid Rs. 9 crores to come behind the mike, the production house has chosen to keep the film's origin as a closely held secret.Well, the secret which has been unveiled now throws quite some surprise as it is revealed that the animation film Jumbo is neither an Indian product nor has it been made in collaboration with an International animation house. Instead, Percept Picture Company has claimed the rights of a Thai film that goes by the name of Khan Kluay.Khan Kluay, which was released in 2006, is a Thai computer-animated feature film and is about a baby elephant named Khan Kluay who wanders away from his mother and eventually becomes the war elephant (for whom Akshay Kumar has given the voice-over).The film has been directed by Kompin Kemgumnird, an animator who has worked on the Disney features such as Atlantis: The Lost Empire & Tarzan and also Blue Sky Studios' Ice Age. The film was in the making for three years and cost 150 million baht (about $3.9 million USD). When released in 2006, the film was the highest grossing Thai film in 2006 with an approximate box-office receipt of 91 million baht. The film has already been released on DVD in the United States with its title as The Blue Elephant. The movie has won numerous awards ever since its release and now looks at making an impression at Indian theaters with Akshay Kumar endorsing its case." 
" Very lovely and inspiring; eye-opener to Thai culture and warring-era.","To a person who is genuinely interested with the animal kingdom, people's history and culture, Khan Kluay (2006) is certainly impressive. The beautiful animations are both adorable and majestic which makes it truly an elephant tale which is also very lovely and inspiring. Half of this film is mainly about war but that doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, it is an eye-opener to Thai culture and warring-era. It can educate and enlighten, which also makes Khan Kluay (2006) quite an ideal teaching and learning tool for children as it is also filled with plenty of uplifting scenes. In brief, this animated feature is bittersweet as it has its own compelling life lessons. There are several themes that can be too serious for children; nonetheless vital to acknowledge and survive in our world. PS. I personally feel Khan Kluay (2006) needs longer running time although it's already amazing. Luckily, we can have more of it because there's Khan Kluay 2 (2009)!" 
" An elephant who fights for his country and loved ones.","I have to say, this is one of the best animated movies i've ever seen. This movie teach us to not only fight for our loved ones but also for the freedom of our country even if our army is small in number. Of course, some may find this movie unsuitable for kids because of war and violence, but I do not. The lead character (Kon Kluay) learns that he must never fight with others from his mother from his young age. This statement is a good lesson for young kids. However, Kon Kluay fights for his country's freedom after learning what has happened to his father. This movie is about having courage and mental strength to fight for your freedom and loved ones no matter how strong your enemies are nor for the riches of the world.In my opinion, even though this has a bit violence which maybe disturbing for children, this movie can teach kids good morals." 
" Hidden treasure!","I watched "Khan Kluay" aka "The Blue Elephant" English version. This film seems to have receive poor reviews from several people expecting a "G" type Disney movie, but in my opinion it was a very good film. Definitely worth watching at least once. The animation was better then average, even if it was not up to par with the big name releases. It had a storyline that I think would appeal to both adults as well as children. It was not a baby / child movie as your first impression of the cover might lead you to believe.And despite the lack of blood, it was a story of strength, fighting for good, and of perseverance. It was entertaining, and had a happy ending." 
" Lovely but copied.","I enjoyed this film while seeing on TV i noticed that all desings are similar like in a thai ar elephants i caughted it on its real name 2006 released (Khan Kluay). but pribhi love jumbo." 
" Typical","Was enjoying watching it with my kids - the animation is good and the story was interesting enough. But then it came to the part where they are teaching kids that animals don't harm one another unless they are being threatened, "only MAN does that".... First of all, that's a total crock. Animals of all different species will hurt and kill each other for a variety of reasons and not always out of some basic necessity either. I'm tired of movies promoting this idea that the animal kingdom is this peaceful wonderful place and that humans should feel guilty and bad because we're horrible awful creatures. Embedding this guilt into our psyches and teaching kids to think this way is how we end up with tragedies like Timothy Treadwell's death. Am I getting a bit worked up over a simple kids movie? Perhaps. But for me it felt like the straw that broke the camel's back, there are far too many children's animal/nature movies like this, created by people who don't know a thing about nature." 
" Barely captured the attention of my li'il one for a few minutes - beat that!!!","To cash on the popularity of newly discovered animated movies in India and the rising popularity of Akshay Kumar, Khan Kluay/ The Blue Elephant is viewed as a cash cow. What a con game!!!At least "Hum Hain Laajawab" was clean enough to claim it was The Incredibles. But Jumbo is a big farce and I am happy it ended up the well-deserved tanking at the box office.With regards to the story, it simply fails to connect with the children. A simple linear story could have been identifiable with kids, but the story starts off on a wrong note. Even my son felt disenchanted within 30-minutes. As for me, the movie seemed to be a rehash of Lion King.Waste of effort to get names like Akshay Kumar, Lara Dutta, Dimple Kapadia, Gulshan Grover, Asrani, Rajpal Yadav into this failed miserable venture." 
" The cover is very misleading","This movie is very disappointing. The cover is aimed at little kids, you would be forgiven for thinking it would all cute, warm and fuzzy.Definitely NOT! It is full of death war and violence! Please research this further before allowing your little girls watch this one.The suggestions of "if you liked this you'll like care bears" is also misleading. If you liked this movie you are more likely a nine to 12 year old boy into armies and battles.The movie glorifies war and dying for your country. I cannot say enough how disappointed I was and how misleading the cover and review on the cover is."
