" A Horror Film made entirely in a humorous format!","This film has been entirely copied from the Hollywood movie "The Others" (2002). But it has been made in a destructive way that if you have watched THE OTHERS you couldn't help laughing on this so-called horror film. It was made so badly and couldn't get any promotions therefore it was a box office washout. No one really cared to watch it. The characters are so unreal, and they have acted so badly that the horror story appears to be a comedy. Just when you try to think over the story a vivacious song comes in. Never mind, Himesh Reshammiya music is only the best technical part of the movie. Direction is too weak to grip the audiences. I would rate it as 7/10 because it made me laugh continuously till the end. I believe it is the first horror film which has been made to make you laugh rather than scare." 
" God! it's a doozy..","It's kind of my first review on imdb so please pardon me for any mistakes. Now back to the movie, I saw this movie when I was a little kid and I was blown away by the twist ending I mean hell it's amazing I mean as a kid this movie was a breeze of fresh air for me but than I came across the movie from which it was copied . The movie which I am talking about is "The others" starring nickole Kidman . That movie was way superior than this movie . When I first saw others I lost all respect for anjane not only that I felt like being cheated as I couldn't enjoy the real movie as I had already seen it's copied version . Now many would argue what if it's a copy many movies now a days are but let me tell you something it's not only the copying that bored me on second viewing of the movie I found out not only that it's a total rip-off but also all the actors other than Manisha koiralla were terrible and even she was hammering it in . It was loosing it's mysterious tone that nickole Kidman was bringing to the table. Apart from that the pacing of the movie is too slow at times you can actually wish why these people are talking so much time the only thing that worked for the movie was it's twist ending that too was copied so I can't give it that . At last I will only saw why not watch the real version instead of this crap."
