" Good Aloo Chat and Perhaps Bhel Puri As Well - Good Movie.","Aloo Chaat is a delicacy of Northern India and is not just spicy but also tasty and this is what the director of this movie has done  making it interesting, instead of tasty, to watch a nice satirical comedy which can be considered as a feast for your eyes. A movie that will make you laugh and more so when a youngster brings in two women, of which he loves one only but is unable to marry her due to his father's beliefs.The movie starring Aftab Shivdasani, introduces TV actress Aamna Shariff, Khulbhushan Kharbanda, Dolly Ahluwalia, Linda Arsenio, Manoj Pahwa, Lalit Parashar, Sanjay Mishra. Chandan Anand and Meenakshi, is directed by Robby Grewal and is written by Divy Nidhi Sharma.It's nice to see Aamna Shariff in her first movie after working for Balaji Telefilms and has proved herself to be a good actress and is capable of working in a good comedy genre movie. After a long time, Aftab Shivdasani, has made a return to the screen and even that in a film such as this and has shown that he has not lost his touch in comedy acting. The rest of the cast are also good but what has really made it worth is Robby Grewal's direction. Besides directing films such as "Samay  When The Time Strikes," he has shown that he is also able to direct a comedy and he has done this in a flawless manner.A good, decent and clean comedy that can be watched with your family. Absolutely worth it." 
" The movie captures all the spice, the fun and the deliciousness of falling in love.","Aloo Chaat is a romantic comedy about a America return Hindu boy who is in love with a Muslim Girl. The movie is set in Delhi and is a comical portrayal of the reactions of a typical middle class Punjabi family when they find out. A hilarious story with all the twists & turns of falling in love. Aloo Chaat, the name comes from an Indian dish, made of potatoes and spices - it's delicious & a favorite with street food lovers. The movie captures all the spice, the fun and the deliciousness of falling in love.It is a laugh-a-minute film with some amazing performances by very talented actors. In fact, Robby Grewal has managed to get Aftab to act. What is noteworthy is Robby Grewal's sensitivity to clichéd perceptions of his community, albeit without the slightest hint of a parochial, prejudiced world view. He stares at those areas that Mira Nair just walked by. If Monsoon Wedding is a fleeting view of a community celebrating the goodness and alienating the worst in itself, Aloo Chat is a community celebrating the utter lack of pretensions.Aloo Chat is funny. But it's also honest and subtle, with a lurking-beyond-the-surface humour. And Robby Grewal's eyes are well equipped to celebrate that enchanting sense of life that only Delhi, the city of refugees can provide." 
" Aloo Chaat : Laughter in a spicy way !!","The movie is typically based in the Indian Capital New Delhi portraying a Punjabi family. The lone son of the family Nikhil played by Aftab Shivdasani is just back from America and is now being forced to select a suitable girl. He already loves a girl Aamna played by Aamna Sharif but since she is a Muslim it wont be easily accepted by the family. So in order to change the mind set of the typical traditional family, Nikhil, Aamna,Niki (Linda Arsenio ) set up a nice drama where in Aamna has to win the family. Will Aamna be able to win their heart is the big question of the movie and if yes how would she do it ?The entire set up is hilarious and the movie has some very good performances by Aftab, Sanjay Mishra, Linda and Kulbhushan Kharbanda. The movie is a comedy about situations and doesn't force laughter onto you. The dialogue delivery and the situations are quite humorous and will make a every good dinner movie with your family. A must watch if u want be light headed for a stress full tomorrow." 
" DDLJ - The Other Way Around","For starters, one fails to understand the logic behind the title "Aloo Chat". Except for the two blokes mouthing inane dialogues far and between there is absolutely no connection to the plot whatsoever. Perhaps "DDLJ - The Other Way Around" would have been more appropriate title. Reason: the second half of DDLJ plot forms the baseline for the movie. The only difference is the ver 2.0 the girl gate-crashes into the house with the sole-intent of wooing the family. How she passes the litmus test and wins over the heart is Aloo Chaat. Well then why the first-part of DDLJ given a skip? Answer: Budget constraints on overseas shoot. Instead, the romance makes a shift-base to "economical cutting-chai apna desh" in the by-lanes of Delhi on a tonga. Howzzat!!! Verdict:: Sorry, doesn't connect especially with the Detective hot on heels.Let us draw parallels with DDLJ:: 1. Hatching the plan of dropping in the middle of enemy's terrain.2. Father is the pillar of opposition (boy's father ie, and ver 2.0 the opposition is not "beer" but religion!). 3. Wedding dates are pre-poned owing to health reason.4. Punjabi song (the girl reprises the "Doli Saja Ke Rakhna" version).In all honesty, its difficult to judge if Aloo Chaat is a reality-check or a humorous take on DDLJ.* The spirit of Delhi is neatly blended into the storyline.* The format of narrative deserves a special mention* A few comic moments are done wellPerformances::* Khulbushan Kharbanda:: The veteran proves that is at ease in comedy too. Indeed versatile.* Aftab:: No comments though had immense potential to showcase his talent.* Aamna Sharief:: It difficult to comment on her performance as most of the time you are besotted with her infectious smile. * Manoj Pahwa:: Passable* Sanjay Mishra:: Irritating. The movie would have lot better should his role was put on leash.* Linda Arsenio:: Good job there.Verdict:: Passable for a one-time watch.PS: Do pay attention to scene where ver 1.0 is referenced (read that "paid homage")." 
" One of the Best Indian Comedy Movie","This is one of the best Indian Comedy Movie I have ever seen. As usual acting of Sanjay Mishra in the role of Chhadami was hilarious. Manoj Pahwa in the role of Hakeem Tarachand was a perfect fit for the movie. I've already seen this movie 5-6 times and can see it 9-10 time more. It's a complete family entertainment movie. Songs are also good specially the title track and the Punjabi wedding song(which is again one of my favorite Punjabi folk song). A little disappointed with the end otherwise the movie is completely awesome and full family entertainer.Aftab did good acting but I expect more from him. I want director to make its sequel as well. Hope they will make it soon. RDB and Kailash Kher song rocks." 
" Lots of fun. Hugely underrated.","Have to write a review for this one as it so really deserves it. This is one of those hugely entertaining movies which I have on my media server so that I could play them again and again (some of the others include 3 Idiots, Chup Chup Ke, Hungama, Hulchul, All the Best etc). It is a light-hearted love story with some wonderful performances not only by the leads but also by the supporting cast. Sanjay Mishra as "Chhadami" is probably the most memorable character of the movie. He is both hilarious and lovable. A lifetime role I would say. Similarly, Manoj Pahwa also gets to play a memorable role as a Hakeem Tarachand. One role that's the first to come to mind thinking of him as an actor. Kulbhushan Kharbanda does a wonderful job as well. Even protagonist's mother and grandmother, played by Meenakshi and Dolly Ahluwalia respectively, are so effective in their roles. This is a good story writing over all with quite a few very good jokes and lines. The end message (religion/culture shouldn't divide us) is also highly appreciable. It is a bit sad that this movie never got the attention and appreciation it deserved. Here is a little attempt to get it at least some of that attention." 
" Sweet Romantic Comedy but the ENDING spoils it....","Well,If you want to see a movie with your entire family then this is it...this is a movie for you...Aloo Chaat is sweet light hearted romantic comedy..starring Aftab and débutant Aamna...The thing I liked about the movie is that it has got a really good feel about it...You will not be bored at any point...and the fact that its running time is 1 hr 56 mins helps...But I have just one problem with the movie and that is its ending(climax)...that just spoils it...So to summarize i would say that i liked Robby Grewal's previous movie MP3 much more than this..but Aloo Chaat is not that bad either... I'll give it a 7/10 mainly because its a family entertainer..."
