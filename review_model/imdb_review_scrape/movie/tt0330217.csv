" A forgettable relationship","Well, Dil Ka Rishta is a poorly written melodrama which offers nothing special to its audiences except for some moments here and there and a beauty named Aishwarya Rai. The story is clichéd and pointless, and the proceedings are nothing but ordinary and uninteresting series of events which make absolutely no sense. At times I felt it was just made for the sake of making. The film's music is also not particularly good, which is a great disappointment since I've always liked Nadeem Shravan's compositions regardless of how much I enjoyed a film. The title song is nice though. The film stars Aishwarya Rai in the leading role of Tia. She is beautiful, that's something that has been said a million times already but it's not enough to carry the film, especially considering that her acting is not very impressive in this film and she is just okay. See movies like Devdas and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam to understand how the combination of her beauty and acting makes wonders. Arjun Rampal is also okay though in his favour it can be said that he tried his best. Talents like Isha Koppikar and Paresh Rawal are once again wasted, and sadly so. To sum it up, Dil Ka Rishta is a forgettable film which could be easily skipped or avoided." 
" Movies from my childhood imagination","Dil Ka Rishta's script is like it came from my childhood romantic imagination. I love romantic movies, I love musicals, I love beautiful people. This movie has it all. It was my very first real Bollywood movie. As I watched it, I could not believe my eyes. An extremely beautiful leading man falling for an extremely beautiful leading lady, songs galore, drama, comedy, music, dance, etc. Does a movie need anything more? I know that the script is a little hard to take for the western world but, let it slide, and embark on this wonderful ride that is Bollywood. Aishwarya carries the weight on the movie on her able shoulders especially when it comes to the dancing. She is a wonder to behold! In all of the songs, she is a revelation but more so in Saajan Saajan." 
" Not a bad movie.","Dil Ka Rishta is really not a bad movie, but it does falter in a bit. The story-line is way too predictable. Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl but girl is in love with another man. Then boy gets depressed and girl marries the other man until tragic happens. Yup. That sums it up in 2 hours of a movie. I like romantic movies but this one i can just pass and call it a day. Performance wise: Aishwarya Rai was good but she really needs to stop crying at everything. Arjun Rampal was okay. I honestly wished someone else can fill in for Priyanshu Chaterjee, but then again who would wanna be wasted? Paresh Rawal and Rakhee Gulzar were amazing. I wish i could see more Rakhee in newer films. The saving grace of the movie was the music. I don't know why you guys hate the music? The music was excellent. All the songs were great. Nadeem-Shravan never disappoints with music, though i wish they could make more. Nowadays, Bollywood music sucks. I wish the old days were back. And that's why i rated the movie with 7, mostly because of the music" 
" Not worth a Rishta","Dil ka Rishta will soon be a forgotten memory in Ashwaria career.The concept of the story is a tried and tested formula guaranteed with some level of success. Unfortunately, it comes at a time when Indian audiences are expecting more from movie then a simple story being retold. They expect a new twist or angle or a new concept all together. This Dil ka Rishta does not deliver.There is nothing new to the story that has already not been seen before: boy likes girl, she likes someone else and by coincidental twist of fate the boy is responsible for the girls future. The locations are all to common and the songs not that memorable.It is an unfortunate fact that Ash, as good as she is has not delivered an entertaining movie since her Taal / Devdas days, and with only  a few big banner projects for 2004, one wonders if she is still the reigning queen of bollywood?" 
" Fantastic!","I loved this movie. The acting was phenomenal and the story was incredibly well written. A touching romance.The irresistible, macho and perfect man Jai fails to win over the woman of his dreams Tia. Destiny plays its cruel games and in Tia's eyes, Jai soon sees the love, affection and adoration that he had only dreamt of. However, he cannot reciprocate her affection; cannot give Tia a place in his heart although he loves her silently and intensely. What makes Tia fall in love with Jai? Why does Jai turn away from that precious love? All is revealed in 'Dil Ka Rishta', a touching film and an emotional journey on celluloid." 
" Worth a one time see.. for aish","Dil ka rishta is a worth see for fans of aishwarya but for others it doesn't delivers too much. The pre-release hype rose expectations of viewers but apart from good performances by aishwarya (as tia) and arjun rampal (sa jai) the film fails to deliver much. The movie is about this guy jai who loves tia so much that even after around four years of their last meeting he drinks to fight with the memories of his first (and last) love. And finally when he decides to give  up the alcohol thing he crashes into tia's car. Tia loses her husband and guess what her memory (..phew). Any how first half keeps you interesting but the fate of the movie depends on the second half which is penned unimaginably. Predictably now tia is after jai and he cant reciprocate knowing the truth (and the presence of tia's mother). Somehow he describes the whole thing to tia (though Dr claimed it could cause her death..:() Anyhow arjun rampal has come up with a great performance while aishwarya has done her bit looking amazing sometimes and disappointing othertimes (esp in the song daiya daiya..). A lot of effort wasted i guess with a loose ending. The writer and the director should have culminated the story in a much more intriguing and efficient manner." 
" Arjun Rampal and Aishwarya Rai burn up the screen with their chemistry in this cute film!","The script is very hard to take but once (and if) you can get over it, the film is pure bitter-sweet and life sagas. The chemistry between Arjun and Aishwarya (former modeling partners) is undeniable! Aishwarya plays Tia, a young plucky school teacher whom Jai (Arjun) spots and falls in love with on a trip to India from South Africa to celebrate his mother's birthday. It's lucky for him that his childhood best-friend is Tia's co-worker and so he develops excuses to hang around the school in order to meet Tia. The meeting eventually takes place and he begins to seduce Tia with gifts and the likes, only to find out abruptly that she has a boyfriend and is actually engaged to him. This doesn't matter to Jai as he continues to try and use his riches and charm to seduce Tia, to catastrophic levels! The films is directed by Naresh Malhotra {The game of love, Sahibaan} and showcases some spectacular song and dance numbers! Paresh Rawal and Priyanshu Chatterjee co-star." 
" Why?","Poor film, bad plot and bad choice of characters. Worst movie I have seen. This film is promotes drink driving and justifies the killing of two innocent people. Makes me quite sick that the main character walks away from two murders- when in fact had he been in US/UK he would be put in prison for a LONG time- and gets the girl he wants and lives happily ever after. There is no justice in India, if you are rich you are above the law. This film is an insult to anything India and the Indian justice system, or lack off. Waste of time, I am thankful i did not pay for it. This is an insult to Bollywood, please do not watch this film" 
" Moral of the story: To get your ex-love back 'Drink And Drive'.","The tagline says, "when the past connects" which is justified by the fact that some past tried-and-tested formulas connects the scattered storyline of this caper.It's the usual boy meets girl start. Needless to add, love blooms at first sight. The boy  Jai (Rampal) proposes. Alas the girl  Tia (ever heard such a name?) is already booked by Raj (Priyanshu). Jai still keeps trying but Tia marries Raj and multiplies. RUMpal, drinks and drives and gets only Raj and Tia's car to crash in. Raj dies and Tia suffers from the regular memory loss syndrome, something that follows after each Bollywood accident. Jai takes charge of Tia's family and eventually girl starts loving boy. Moral of the story: To get your ex-love back 'Drink And Drive'. Mommy Rai's obsession for scripting bears faint resemblance with Tum Bin, which in turn was a spin-off on Gulzar's Kinara. Nadeem Shravan's tunes are passable but Kumar Sanu hissing hay hay hay in the background whenever the cupid strikes is somewhat irritating. Ash acts very unnatural, carrying a plastic smile throughout. Surprisingly Arjun Rampal, improves shaking off his wooden image. Isha Koppikar is wasted for there's no scope for an item number. Priyanshu's bit though sweet, is so short that by the end of the flick the audience tends to say bhaisaab, aapko pehle bhi kahin dekha hai. To sum up, Dil Ka Rishta fails to bond a strong relation with your heart." 
" For beautiful Music and beautiful pairing....","Music of the movie is awesome....my favorite Alka and K Sanu...
Aish looked beautiful in Indian dresses. Story could have been better." 
" Nothing like the trailer","I saw the trailer on YouTube which which sparked my interest on this Bollywood film for several reasons. I really enjoy Bollywood films for the dancing and the music where the trailer mostly contained and I am a big fan of Arjun Rampal who I rarely see. I also enjoy the lovely Aishwarya Rai, who in the Trailer came across as a entertainer who was trying to get Arjun's attention for some reason in two occasions where she performed wonderful fantastically.
I didn't get a clue about the car wreck or her husband ( or him being killed ) in the trailer at all ! Talk about walking into a movie blind. That's really the bad part of the movie for me. Yes, the plot really needed work such the Mother's role in the second half where she would appear suddenly like a Vulture with that hateful stare. Damn, it could burn a house down. Good work for the actress playing her, sorry I forgot her name."

" Not So Good","I think that the first time I saw it, it will be good because the cast are Arjun and Aishwarya and their both were famous, but my opinion was absolutely wrong, the movie was bad and they were acting very bad until I can not feel any emotion from this movie.The story is not so bad if they can make it better for the ending. I really feel dismiss by this movie and don't know what to say anymore. Even Aishwarya can not save this movie from run down from the box office. Beside there is nothing important moment that I can think that it was good enough to watched.Aishwarya was so thin in this movie, looks like she doesn't eat enough food in this movie (thank God she's fatter in Bride And Prajudice)." 
" A movie that is not even worth watching the whole way through even if it is your first time watching it","You would think that a movie starring the beautiful Aishwarya Rai and Arjun Rampal, there would be potential, but no, it fails on every level. It starts off like a normal family film, but takes a sudden turn once Rampal's character, Jai, finds out that Rai's character, Tia, is engaged to the love of her life, Raj (Priyanshu Chatterjee). From there, the movie goes downhill. Tia loses her memory and starts falling for Jai, but he constantly pushes her away. It just gets ridiculous when they say that regaining her memory will cause her to go crazy, but when everything is revealed at the end, she forgives him because she doesn't remember the past. That's a major plot devise. I feel sorry for Alka Yagnik and Kumar Sanu, two of the best singers, to have sung the songs in this film. Do not even go near it. If you see, just walk away."
