" Another excellent Salman Khan performance but script fails","I had huge expectations for the film. There was quite a bit of hype for the film, considering it is Salman's first film since his last film, the excellent critically acclaimed Tere Naam. One thing going against the film is the fact so many cop flicks have been released eg Khakee, Ann, Police Force etc. Out the ones released Khakee being the best one.However, Salman Khan's bravado performance was awesome. Salman Khan is the best in the industry at portraying intimidating characters. Tere Naam is another example of this. Salman Khan makes it believable. At the same time he easily portrays the good son, good brother, good friend and lover at the same time.Punnet Isaar's script is too outdated to work in this era. Baghban was an exception , however that film had an emotional appeal as the basis of the story happens in this day and age still. Overall, just watch it for Salman Khan's bravado performance. As an overall film, it is poor." 
" Another example of an honest and dutiful policeman","Garv is a story of three brave, honest and dutiful cops Arjun Ranawat, Samar Singh and Haider Ali Khan. Samar Singh wants the state to be a crime free state with the help of encounter specialist Arjun Ranawat and Haider Ali's team force. But they can't help him because the powerful politician Kashinath Trivedi, Yeshwant Pandey etc. made the state corrupted by staying connected with the underworld don Zafar Supari. Salman's role as a serious encounter specialist Arjun Ranwat is a good ingredient of the movie. After a long long time Salman figured out himself in such a serious role with no-nonsense manner, which previously he made habit in David Dhawan's directions. He could have become a good role model for the entire policemen if the movie did better than a below average (as per box-office report) outcome. But Shilpa Shetty's role here seems out of requirement as she had no much role to impress the audience just than a bar dancer and later a housewife. Last but not the least, Garv walks in the same route to Sarfarosh but the carriage is not as strong and normal as the latter one." 
" Full of highly intense action and its patriotic. Music could've been a little better.","Salman Khan shines in these kinds of roles; his performance is good as expected. Amrish Puri also did well in the movie along with Arbaaz Khan and Shilpa Shetty. Mukesh rishi was also OK. Others such as Farida Jalal and Anupam Kher were half-decent too. There's only one good song in the movie: 'soniye to soni'. The story is good and so too are the dialogues, most of which are delivered by Salman Khan. What is best about the movie is the action. A lot of people will say 'ouch' quite a lot throughout the movie and/or turn their head the other way. It is, after all, quite gruesome.Verdict:you must watch it if you're not squeamish. Since i'm not squeamish, I give it 8/10" 
" SPOILER: Following might be SPOILER Not bad","The story is presented in an interesting timeframe. The opening scene shows a mob of people booing Salman as he goes to jail after a mass murder of politicians. The majority of the story takes place in a flashback showing how corruption dominates politics and the police force. Salman and his partner Arbaaz's heroic efforts to bring peace to Mumbai reach several steps to success but also to tragic failure and sacrifice. There's also an interesting segment based on religious prejudice in the government. Salman and Arbaaz's innovate concept of an "encounter team" sparks immense shock and controversy in the city. The entire story boils down to the climactic court case of Salman, which has several interesting elements to it. The Khan brothers give a good performance. Shilpa's role is very miniscule and meaningless." 
" Pride & Honour","Salman plays Arjun Ranawat, Inspector is a terror to the underworld. The underworld has tried time and again to get rid of him, but has failed.Amrish Puri plays a Sr. Inspector samar Singh who is a very honest. When Samar comes to know that Kashinath Trivedi has won the election, he puts his resignation. The reason being Kashinath Trivedi is a corrupt politician and has got underworld connection too.Zafar Supari played by Mukesh Rishi, the self-declared king of underworld is delighted too as he is happy that he can reign again. Though Samar Singh resigns from his job, two honest police officers Arjun Ranawat and Hyder Ali (Arbaaz Khan) are the thorns in their path. They won't allow Kashinath Trivedi and Zafar Supari sit in peace. They try the usual method of divide and rule among them in which Hyder Ali is killed. The blame is put on Arjun Ranawat who is suspended from his duty. Trial continues against him in connection with Hyder's murder as well as his alleged affair with his sister too played by a small time actress Akshanksha. How Salman defends his case and proves his innocence is the story of the movie. He also has to take revenge of Hyder Ali'e murder.Anupam Kher plays the role of Tyagi, a lawyer who defends cases against Zafar Supari and Kashinath Trivedi. All the characters are good and justified their role. Directed by Puneet Issar, for a change Salman has acted very well." 
" A very weak film only partially elevated by Khan's presence","Back in those days, Salman Khan was a highly popular star, and to his credit he had hardly been part of those big-budget films made by Chopra, Ghai and the likes. Khan is a good entertainer, and a great strength of his is that he never seemed to consider himself a particularly good actor, neither did he really pretend to take the acting part of acting too close to heart. It was all about a good presence and a likably honest persona. In this film he actually does seem to try to show the opposite, but sadly he never manages to turn it into something particularly special since the film is not very good in the first place. Khan apparently just doesn't have the right flair for choosing the right movies. This is the same age old story of pride and honour, love and sacrifice, principles and values, rape and revenge, and they hardly ever ring true. They could have, had they been tackled by a more competent and imaginative writer or director. But the result is a stale, highly outdated film which doesn't work in spite of Khan's presence. The story lacks any possible depth and conviction. Then we have the usual heroine, played by Shilpa Shetty, whose appearance is basically restricted to the lavish songs. Speaking of songs, there's a nice number called "Hum Tumko Nigahon Mein". The action scenes are not that bad, relatively speaking, but they are typically exaggerated and all stretched out, just like the film itself." 
" Great Film","Blockbuster Film Salman Khan as Police officer action too good" 
" Outdated","After Salman's success of TERE NAAM(2003) Plenty of his films released like GARV which released in 2004, The film worked only because of Salman's presence The film is otherwise a heckeyened outdated film, In that year suddenly cop films were in fashion and thousands of cop films released like KHAKEE(the best), AAN, Police Force.etc and it got irritating Watching GARV it looks like watching an 80s film with actors speaking dialogues(shouting) like there are doing a Mahabharat act. The film starts well but there's nothing that you haven't seen before, the first half is fast paced, only to be punctuated with songs and a forced romance. There are clichÃ©d villains, loud politicians, maa and behen and almost everything we thought disappeared from Hindi films.Direction by Puneet Issar is not great Music is okaySalman Khan has thousands of hairstyles in the film, he does a restrained job and is decent at many places though monotonous at some Also his X marking part looks odd, Arbaaz Khan is decent in his role Shilpa Shetty has a blink and miss role, Farida Jalal is typecast, Akanshka who is the producer's relative annoys with her loud acting and shouting, Amrish Puri is decent, Anupam Kher excels, Govind Namdeo hams, Mukesh Rishi is as usual, Anant Jog, Shivaji Satham are as usual" 
" Awesome","What a Film Superb one of SalmanKhan best Performance" 
" Low Quality Junk","This movie was junk, an absolute waste of time. Salman Khan must be the most narcissistic male alive. He constantly has to preen in front of the camera, flexing his muscles while trying to suck in his gut. The movie does have some positive messages such as the need to not scapegoat police for everything and treat them according to double standards. But the fight scenes are garbage, the melodrama is childish, and the gang-rape scene was salacious trashy cinema intended purely for shock value, just like go-go dancing scenes with those ugly dancing girls. Salman's receding hairline and growing gut mean that he'll have to find another career sometime soon, because he won't be tenable on screen for much longer." 
" nice movie","Fantastic movie .you must watch it > salama is excellent" 
" Idiotic film","If there are two idiot actors in Indian films, the credit should go to Salman (Shirtless) Khan and Arbaaz (goofy) Khan. The 23 odd reels, are based on these two imbeciles walking around with a chip on their shoulders, as if they are the only conscious of the society. As usual there is ethnic diversity in the names, and ethnic conflicts that seems to be indigenous to the police force in a big city where as other cities don't seem to have these conflicts or the conflicts are not subject for a thriller as in this Magnum Trash called "Garv-Pride and Honor". As usual the politicians are corrupt and the cops are ordained from GOD to bring good will and peace to this Metropolis. Apparently corruption is very rampant where a policeman would rip his shirt off denouncing the hierarchy, and it takes only few phone calls by Salman, the guy is back to work-it is amazing what a lousy script can do to a Hindi movie. The movie is for someone who has absolutely and positively nothing to do and have fetish for looking at two degenerate morons for actors. These maggots would be better off selling kabobs in Kabul."
