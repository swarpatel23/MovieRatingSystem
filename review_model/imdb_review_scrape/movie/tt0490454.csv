" College student falls for best friend's father...","Daniel D'Souza (Rahul Roy) is widower as well as a famous singer. On his wife's deathbed 18 years ago; he promised to dedicate his whole life to bringing up their daughter Jenny (Mriga Saklani) by spending quality time with her which he was unable to do with his wife because of work. Jenny is a doting and doted upon daughter who has a very close relationship with her dad and refers to him as her best friend. She is in love with Romi (Manish Mathur) and hopes to marry him. Jenny's best friend Mehak (Janki Shah) comes to know about her relationship with Romi and is upset that Jenny hadn't told her about it. Jenny takes Mehak around to meet her dad and Mehak falls for her dad. Daniel (along with Jenny and Romi) invites Mehak and her parents to Goa for a short holiday to celebrate Mehak's birthday. Daniel has a one night stand with Mehak (seemingly whilst dreaming about his late wife, Maria) and regrets it instantly. When they get back home Daniel tells Mehak it was a mistake and basically tries to shake her off, not wanting Jenny to find out as she means the world to him, although Mehak won't take no for an answer and pursues him relentlessly.Where can I start with my analysis of this film? It has to be about the most poorly acted/produced/directed/scripted film I can remember ever seeing. None of the actors in the main roles seem to have any idea about acting. Rahul Roy in the lead role has been around for years apparently and he is just one big joke. Not once during the film did I see any different facial expressions on the leads, whether they were laughing, flirting, crying or even angry. It was so bad that I actually wondered if they had been told to keep the same boring deadpan expression on their faces throughout the film. It really was shocking to see the lack of chemistry between any of the characters.Are you getting the impression that I did not enjoy this film? Well, you'd be right. The dialogue tried to be clever and sensitive in parts but as a whole it was really quite appalling. The characters' physical behaviour and subsequent attitudes to each other made no sense whatsoever. Mehak starts as an innocent young woman dressed rather conservatively - she has a one night stand with Daniel and turns into a man-eating vamp chasing a man who keeps telling her he is still in love with his late wife. Jenny's boyfriend Romi is quite happy to jump into bed with Jenny at every given opportunity and seems quite modern and forward thinking and then gets upset when he finds out about Daniel and Mehak and cares more about what society will think. If he was so concerned with what society thinks, what was he doing having a romp with his girlfriend in bed in Goa with the door wide open so anyone walking past could get an eyeful? Overall I'd give this film a poor 1 out of 10. If I could get away with giving a lower rating I would! Don't waste your time watching this; the film is so poor that no one seems to have written a review about it ANYWHERE on the net. There, I've saved you over 2 hours of your life!" 
" rahul roys huge mistake","i watched this movie just for rahul roy and after watching this movie i didn't know how to react?? it was OK rahul roy gained a lot of weight in this movie!!!! and the guy who plays romi enjoys jumping in bed or either kissing his girlfriend all the time!!! the alcoholic father becomes sober all of a sudden!! rahul roy was 37 in this movie and he plays a father of a girl who doesn't even look like his daughter at all she looks like his sister instead.... if i had a rewind button i wouldve stopped rahul roy from making this mistake and i realized i wasted 3 dollars for this movie and if there was a refund on this movie i wouldve done it sorry rahul roy this is one of your biggest mistake in bollywood overall this movie was OK but choose wisely next time!!!"
