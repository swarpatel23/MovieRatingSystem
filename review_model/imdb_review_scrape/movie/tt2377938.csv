" A mind boggling thriller by man who made a ordinary day SPECIAL as A Wednesday","You don't need almost 832 twists in a script to make it look slick and classical thriller. Neeraj Pandey proved it with Special 26. AND one more thing : All PANDEYz of bollywood please stay aside as this PANDEY is something extraordinary with his hand on script and direction. lets move back to film. film starts with a bang (Heist) which stuns you more because of body language of characters and the direction (ofcourse background score should get the praise too) film moves to some rom-com plot suddenly but without making you bore. First half was good but when the second half starts it takes it to another level. beyond our imagination and a amazing climax leaves you thrilled. film keeps you on the edge of seat throughout the 2 and half hour. astonishing sets,superb background score,tight script,marvelous performance and NEERAJ PANDEY. lets say the later NAME is enough to make you expect the unexpected. lets have a look to the performances : Manoj Bajpayee is amazing. one more time he gave his BEST and i don't think its necessary to say he is one of the most talented actor bollywood ever have. Anupam kher is also awesome with all his body language and dialogue delivery stuff. BUT this man AKSHAY was the show stealer. He did something out of the box and did it so brilliantly that you will remember him as his character name AJJU more than akshay. A film not to miss this weekend. All the abusive words got silenced and its a clean family entertainer with all the element to entertain and thrill you. missing such a cinematic experience will be a crime for a movie buff and bollywood lover. Rating : ALL THE STAR IN SKY" 
" Great acting makes special 26 more special...","Special 26 is a heist movie based on real life incidents of 1987...I considered watching this movie because of the director of A Wedesday..NEERAJ PANDEY..and he didn't fail to deliver...Heist movies in bollywood are generally filled with crap like glamor,show-off and pulling off practically impossible stuff...and thats where special 26 stands above all....Great direction, incredible acting, perfect screenplay and a great script made this normal heist-kind off plot into the very best of its kind that bollywood has never seen....This fake CBI based concept is perfectly executed and what makes it standout is really good acting.AKSHAY KUMAR( who i consider bollywood's best)has finally found a good movie to do and he does it to perfection.But its ANUPAM KHER and MANOJ BAJPAI who steal the show with their perfect portrayal of difficult-to-play roles...the supporting cast does a fabulous job...except KAJAL AGARWAL...there was really no need for her character in the movie...Special 26 will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout 2.30 hours and an incredible climax will make you appreciate the movie...Except for AKSHAY-KAJAL segments, which were really not needed in the movie, Special 26 is perfect in every department and regardless of the business it does at the box office(I really don't give a damn about that),this movie is one of the all time greats in bollywood for me..." 
" Special Neeraj Pandey's another special one.","He did it again. Though budget was seven times than "A Wednesday" (first masterpiece directed by Neeraj Pandey ) still it wasn't much hyped one ( or may be i don't watch TV these days). I came to know about this notorious saga when one of my friend messaged me to watch it . Thanks to her!! Its being ages since I watched well crafted ingenious Bollywood thriller( recommended to get over with trauma of Race 2). And that to con classic is a really a treat. And what makes it more interesting is "Based on real story" factor (though definitely more fiction).The movie is set in late 80's (specifically 1987). For starting 10 minute never felt that its a con movie. Thought of some kind of vigilant drama. But then subtle revelation made it clear. Story moves with introduction of all characters. One thing which was perfect about the movie was the feel of 80's. Airports, roads, vehicles, hotels,places where people use to hide money, panoramic view of cities, clips of events from 80's, demeanor of characters (Pleat pants wore by Bajpai,simple sweaters even the watch wore by Akshay was 80's item). The perfectly executed raid scenes with money shelled out from imaginative places. Brilliant and unpredictable climax. All adding stars to this con epic.Only week points were repetition of some scenes which were unnecessary, lady love of Akshay Kumar as per Indian Rule book, boring songs.Good to see Akshay Kumar doing something good (small trivia Neeraj waited for this movie almost 3 years just because he wanted Akshay to play lead role and in return benign Akshay charged only half of his normal fees), Anupam Kher and Manoj Bajpai at their best. Others playing their part.Final verdict : Watch it for intelligent con thriller, horse and buggy Indian days and Stellar Akshay Kumar's performance.Rating : 8/10." 
" Special Chabbis (and not twenty six) Â… a special entertainer for all movie lovers","After having watched "A Wednesday" by Neeraj Pandey innumerable times, I stepped into the cinema hall with high expectations from his latest movie Special Chabbis. And Pandeyjee has managed to pull off another amazing entertainer with a fast-paced & exciting plot. This is one of those movies which keeps on lingering in your mind even after the climax and you keep going back to the brilliant sequence of events and how they were executed throughout the plot.The movie is set in 1987 based on a true incident when a person posed as a fake CBI officer and robbed a famous jeweller at the Opera House in Mumbai. This incident forms the basis of the plot and how a group of conmen conduct false raids as CBI or IT officials to con politicians, businessmen and high profile people to rob them of their money. These heists are never reported as most of the money is black money and none of these high profile people want to be in the news for wrong reasons.Neeraj Pandey after his directorial debut with A Wednesday completely redeems himself with Special Chabbis and reaffirms his position as a master director. He is definitely not a one film wonder and a director to watch out for in the future. The best and the most noticeable part of the film is the period that it has been set in. 1980's have been very effectively portrayed in the movie, whether it was the cars running on the roads or the streets of Delhi especially well known areas like the Connaught Place, whether it was the print style of the newspapers or the clothes and jewellery worn by the actors. The whole movie seems to be set in 1980 and all credit goes to the art director along with the director. I am still wondering how he shot in the heart of Delhi with all these props from the 80s.The casting is perfect and each character in the ensemble of great actors delivers are powerful performance. Akshay Kumar has always been a great actor for me despite critics and so-called intelligent viewers writing him off. As the linchpin of the team he is subtle, intelligent and still manages to be funny in his own earthly way. This is definitely another feather in his cap with his long list of successful movies. Anupam Kher as a vulnerable supporter of the leader and a lustful old man (considering his long line of children) is superb and reminds of a perfect Punjabi uncle. Rajesh Sharma (Munjal from the movie Khosla ka Ghosla) as the third character fits perfectly into the well oiled team as the big guy from a Purani Dilli joint family. Kishore Kadam as the oppressed husband though a reserved role makes an impact. Jimmy Shergill's portrayal of a frustrated suspended police officer is very believable and you can't fail but empathize with the character of Sub- Inspector Ranveer Singh. But, Manoj Bajpayee is the actor which never ceases to amaze me. You put him any role and he shines, sometimes more than the protagonist. As a no nonsense CBI officer he again steals the show and gives another honest performance worth a standing ovation. Kajal Aggarwal (from Singham) is a pretty girl and looks pretty, however her character's contribution to the story is a little frivolous.The climax hits you in typical Neeraj Pandey style which I am sure is fast becoming his signature style in his movies. Full marks to him for great direction, amazing portrayal of all characters, great plot, superb casting and above all perfect detailing.Go and watch it, and I definitely can again. This one definitely lived up to my expectations and left me hungry for more (I waited till the end of casting hoping there would be another surprise scene at the end)." 
" Intelligent Script With Best Performances","After A Wednesday, Neeraj Pandey is back with an intelligent script on a true life incident against corruption. It is a story of con men who looted black money of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen by posing either as CBI or income tax officials. Power of this flick lies in tight script with a last minute twist. This is a perfect answer to Ocean franchise, we can expect sequel as well. After a long time, Akki shows his acting talent in totally new avtaar. Anupam & Jimmy plays his role very well. Manoj is full of power & very well lifted his role. There is no need of female character in script. Loose Point: songs, as there is no need to waste 10-12 precious minutes. Best Dialogue: Asli Power dil me hoti h. Last Words: It is an intelligent movie with best performances. You would not regret watching." 
" Special and Epic","Movie name says it all, its special for movie lovers, awesome story, perfect movie. Everyone gave their best, there are no OTT actions or cheap comedy, no unwanted songs, not a remake from south, original script from perfectionist Neeraj. Akshay Kumar made an u turn with this movie, he should choose more movies like this instead of comedies where he can show his real talent. Manoj and Anupam was awesome. Bolly should make more movies like this then soon Bolly will be compared with Hollywood. the climax of this movie will make u speechless, awesome twist at the climax. Neeraj is perfectionist, his debut A Wednesday was awesome, now he delivers Special 26, like A Wednesday we can watch Special 26 again and again and can say What A Special Movie This Was. One word for the movie EPIC" 
" Very Special Chabbis......","An amazing movie with a very good twist in both the starting and the climax part. All actors have performed well and the movie is worth watching. The amazing weekend blockbuster starring Akshay Kumar, Kajal Aggarwal and supporting actors Manoj Bajpay, Anupam Kher and Jimmy Shergill. This movie marks the comeback of the greatest action star Akshay Kumar in his amazing comic role + serious role. This movie depicts four characters who looted the money of rich people like ministers and jewelery shop owners who were corrupt by claiming themselves to be CBI and in other case as Income Tax Dept. This issue is shown in the movie which refers to actual occurrence of such robberies in the 1980's in India." 
" worth watching more than once !","Finally 2013 has its first Awesome movie. Its been an year with all crappy movies so far. Special 26 steals the show easily.The characters and actors have been so well chosen. Each actor has got the perfect character. The casting could not have been better than this. The direction is superb. So is the Art Direction. The story does not lag anywhere. So its a superb story with some really good editing.Talking about actors -Akshay Kumar - comes out of his day to day roles of khiladi and joker stuff. This is serious cinema which makes him a complete actor.Anupam Kher - reminds everyone that he is still very much the same awesome actor as the one in 90s.Jimmy Sheirgill - chooses the right kind of role finally. He perfectly fits the role of SI Ranvir Singh and also fits well in the 1987 plot.Manoj Bajpai - as good as ever. Special 26 ka CBI inspector Waseem Khan is as good as Wasseypur ka Sardar Khan.Kavya - hardly any role for her. Shes in the movie for songs only.Divya Dutta - standard supportive role. does well.Others - very well done.Art direction for Delhi steals the show. the 1987 Delhi has been brought alive. details have been worked out well. 1987 Mumbai disappointed. I guess it was very tough to recreate that so the director and the VFX team chose the green screen. Thats the shoddiest part of the movie and hence i gave the 9/10 and not a full tenner.Verdict : The movie can definitely been seen more than once at a theater if you get the tickets. It is gonna be a houseful for some days." 
" Special 26 Is A Super-Over-Smart Movie With Traces Of Buffoonery!",""A Wednesday" made me watch this and boy, was I surprised? Was I entertained? Hell yes, Special 26 is 2013's first serious cinema with no cheap humor, ridiculous stunt sequences or the typical B'wood masala. While Akshay Kumar is known for Housefull & Rowdy Rathore, this one plays different with a sharp plot-driven story and an even amazing execution on a real-life incident!Cut out the romance, and this is one gripping, fabulously woven heist drama parallel to what we see in Hollywood flicks. Anupam Kher couldn't get more thespian while Jimmy Shergill & Manoj Bajpayee complement the cast. Direction, screenplay (so that you don't get bored through 2.5 hours), score, acting and every other film factor is thoroughly scrutinized in this. Now, what's even more Special about this movie is that - since the time gap between decent, "movie-wala" movies is so vast, that you just can't get enough of it. Paisa Vasool!Originality in the thefts, corruption, authentic depiction of Indian locations and what-not, I could praise this movie and write a book moreover because it is 2013's one decent try.BOTTOM LINE: I should not reveal much and spoil the broth. Because Special 26 cannot be missed. 100% Recommended but if you are a logic- ridden cinema-goer, you may despise it! Except some dumb plot holes and serious anachronisms, it is a good thriller. But don't expect it anywhere near to what "A Wednesday" was. 10/10Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: Mediocre | Sex & Nudity: No | Violence: No | Smoking, Alcohol & Drugs: No" 
" Best Con Movie That Bollywood has ever produced","This is undoubtedly the best con movie Bollywood has ever produced. Bunty & Bubli, Bluffmaster all take a back seat when compared to this gem. The details with which every con job has been portrayed along the engrossing Background Score keeps you on the edge of your seat for most part of the movie. The romance angle was quite unnecessary though. They should have stuck with Oh My God & Paan Singh Tomar approach. If your story is good enough Indian audiences can forgive the director for not including forceful romantic angles in every movie. By interval you will be unknowingly rooting for the Bad Guys. The way the story ends leaves you in quite an awe. Good times await for Indian audiences and this movie is an indication for the same. Must Must watch for all." 
" Wow wow wow Super wow movie watch rush to near theater now..Double paisa vasool movie","All i say its more than worth to watch this movie.Super movie with full of entertainment and drama. Kajal aggarwal was not up to the mark in movie but standing ovation for Akshay,Jimmy Divya Dutta and last but not the least Manoj ji tremendous job by all of them.All i say Kajal does a bakwas job she was better in singham. But movie full of twist and drama and u do not think to leave your seat. Bit boring part is the chemistry between Akshay and Kajal. And all four team members does a tremendous job. After a long time such a movie come. When 2.40 hrs gone i didn't come to know. My 3 favorite Dialogues:- 1. Asli power Dill main ho ti Ha. 2. Asli kaam to yeah kar rahe Ha hum to bus apni.... 3.full form of CBI is "Central Bank of India"One time must must watch u will definitely have a great memory.:)" 
" A Must See!","Neeraj Pandey's 'Special 26' is A Must See! A nail-biting thriller, that borrows its premise from true events. Its a solidly written, superbly directed & sharply acted film! 'Special 26' is based on a real life group of con artists who pulled off many clever robberies during 1980's, and robbed famous businessmen and politicians by pretending to be the CBI or Income tax officers, and on the pretext of conducting raids they would take away all the black money.'Special 26' has an engaging first-hour, but a spectacular second. The twist in the tale is highly shocking but cleverly executed. Neeraj Pandey, Writer/Director of the 2008 cult-classic 'A Wednesday', delivers another winner with 'Special 26'. His Screenplay is solid, while His Direction is simply superb. Cinematography by Late Bobby Singh is excellent. Editing is good. Art & Costume Design are good.Performance-Wise: Anupam Kher is gloriously scene-stealing. The veteran plays the paranoid yet sly fake CBI Officer with remarkable ease. Akshay Kumar is a terrific actor & he's in serious form this time around. Manoj Bajpai is exemplary, as always. How good can Bajpai get? Jimmy Shergill is restrained. Kajal Aggarwal is fair. Rajesh Sharma is impressive. Divya Dutta sparkles in a cameo.On the whole, 'Special 26' is a gem!" 
" Akshay fooled Manoj and Neeraj fooled the audience","Special Chhabbis (a group of twenty-six specially chosen people) is based on the real life event of the loot of the jewellery showroom of Tribhuvandaas Bheemji Jhaveri in the Opera House of Mumbai (then Bombay) on 19.03.1987. The specialty of the loot was that the robbers had posed as CBI officers giving the loot the look of a CBI raid on the showroom, taking away jewellery worth millions in the shape of the forfeiture of the unaccounted goods. For this purpose, the robbers had used 26 fake probationers of CBI, 'recruiting' them through a fake interview just one day before and telling them that this raid was a 'practical test' for them. This incident gave Neeraj Pandey,the filmmaker a plot to make a thriller movie which has come in the form of Special Chhabis.Neeraj Pandey has shown that there is a group of four conmen who pose themselves as CBI officers or income tax officers and conduct sudden (fake) raids on the business houses and residences of corrupt govt. officials and ministers. The 'confiscated' currency notes and jewellery is their booty with which they vanish in the thin air without the robbery being reported to the police because of its being black money. They are fond of slapping people also while conducting the raid nay robbery. And they are very much proud of this act of theirs too as if they were doing something laudable. Coming from different cities, they assemble only for this joint venture of themselves whenever it is planned by their leader - Ajay (Akshay Kumar). After such a raid at the residence of a minister in Delhi on the Republic Day of India in 1987, the matter reaches the real CBI and an honest and dedicated CBI officer - Wasim Khan (Manoj Bajpayee) starts trailing them. By taping the phone of one member of the gang - P.K. Sharma (Anupam Kher), he comes to know of a big robbery planned to be conducted in the jewellery showroom at the Opera House of Mumbai (Bombay) and also the drama of recruitment of 26 youngsters to use them as ignorant accomplices in this loot. But despite his knowledge of everything, the loot takes place. His team of 26 cops proves to be the Special 26 for the robbers (and not the recruitees) which is used by the mastermind as the ignorant accomplice for the job. Instead of the showroom, the workshop of the owners gets looted where the jewellery of the showroom had been shifted by the real CBI.First let me jot down the pluses of the movie in a nutshell (because their trumpet has been blown by several reviewers quite loud). The filmmaker has created the period of the eighties with almost perfection on the screen which is a great job and deserves high accolades. The performers have done exceedingly well especially Manoj Bajpayee who from every angle, appears to be a no-nonsense CBI officer. The movie contains good humour and Ajay's demonstrating his quick-wit in an unexpected adverse situation is highly impressive. The director has maintained the momentum of the narrative throughout keeping the audience hooked (with the exception of the utterly superfluous romantic track). It's a very interesting movie, no doubt.Almost all the viewers and the reviewers got so much carried away by the entertainment value and the bringing the era of the eighties alive on the screen that they (perhaps unknowingly) bypassed the minuses of this movie which are no less in number than the pluses.The filmmaker has not bothered to explain the reason behind this robbery act of the characters except a (probably false) explanation furnished about Ajay's failing to make it to the CBI years back which led him to become a fake CBI officer. Very less is told about the personal lives of these foursome except the family life of P.K. Sharma containing his wife and several children. Besides, he has glorified the crime as if it were some noble cause. The real CBI officer shifts the jewellery of the showroom to the workshop, replacing it with imitation jewellery. Why ? When the robbers were going to be caught red-handed, what's need for that ?Neeraj Pandey has tried to create an unexpected twist in the climax of this movie in order to give a shock treatment to the audience. However since in case of this movie, the story is a real life incident, he had to amend it to create the desire shock value. This shock is less for the real CBI officer who has been made a fool by the conmen, more for the audience who has been fooled like anything by the filmmaker. It is revealed in the end that the cops who were posing as the ignorant accomplices of the con-gang are actually fake and their real accomplices. How can one digest it because the fake cop (Jimmy Shergill) himself brings the case to the real CBI and himself furnishes the identity and the Chandigarh address of P.K. Sharma (Anupam Kher) enabling the real CBI officer (Manoj Bajpayee) to tape his phone and thereafter trail and nail him ? This is as good as hitting axe on own foot. Besides, when the actual address of Sharma is known to the CBI,how can he escape now ? He has a very large family and establishment behind him. Neeraj Pandey has challenged the intelligence of his audience and fooled them. In no review of this movie (except the one on Koimoi.com) did I find this flaw of the movie being highlighted. What does it mean ? Do we enjoy being made fool just because the filmmaker has entertained us very much ? And is this why that instead of complaining, we start going ga ga over the movie and singing praises for the conman, i.e., the filmmaker ?" 
" A W E S O M E 26 - Very - Good Movie","amazing entertainer with a fast-paced & exciting plot. This is one of those movies which keeps on lingering in your mind even after the climax and you keep going back to the brilliant sequence of events and how they were executed throughout the plot.

" Very Impressive...","Special 26 is a very impressive film from start till end with minor bumps which if edited would have straight away landed it as the Best film of 2013 without even waiting for rest of the movies which will release. Neeraj Pandey has done it again, very talented Director. I am already waiting for his next flick.Special 26 is executed really well with top notch performances from the actors. This movie will keep you waiting for something to happen. Will the elite CBI officer catch the smart con its better you watch it yourself. The movie has its share of light moments which are situational. Songs are not great and the love angle would have been presented better maybe but then you feel it more due the adrenalin the director has already built up.Akshay Kumar is fantastic, Manoj Bajpee is as usual good, Anupam Kher great. Overall the movie is presented very well with the climax being the best a thriller/suspense movie can have. I am sure you will try and guess the climax but rest assured you will be served with a delightful climax which will leave you with may be a Smile on the face or "Hell man he is a genius".I will go with 9/10 and you will know why the lone star is missed." 
" Brilliant plot, hats off to Neeraj..","I have to say that this is the best con movie Bollywood has ever produced; and yes I've seen Doom I & II. After watching Neeraj Panday's directorial debut A Wednesday, expectations for this film was already sky high and he didn't fail to meet our expectations. An excellent plot backed by great acting from the whole crew except Kajal Aggarwal. I don't want to reveal anything about the plot in fear of divulging those great twists in the process. The songs were really poor and irritating and was interrupting the general flow of the story; the romance angle was a complete failure; and though Neeraj did a great job in picturing the gritty real life scenes but in some places they felt a bit dull and lack-lustre. Without those horrible unnecessary soundtracks and romance, this movie could have been bold enough to be compared to OCEAN'S ELEVEN. But overall, this movie is no doubt quite impressive and a must watch for all con movie lovers!!!"
