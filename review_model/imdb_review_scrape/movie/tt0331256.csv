" Not your typical Bollywood movie","Surprisingly this movie is not rated so high. I definitely enjoyed this movie. It was so different than all the latest Indian movies I watched. This movie actually has a good storyline, strong characters and is exciting too. I loved the character Aditya and Prabha, they're portrayed very well. I especially like how Aditya is silent for almost more than half of the movie. Very well played! There were no big dance-shows in this movie to go along with the songs but I think that it was more believable this way. The story is about this woman who works at the police and falls in love with a man she arrested. This man committed a murder. I liked the songs a lot. Especially the one in which there is something said like: "I gave my heart away to you before I knew your name". I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who like the box office top rated Bollywood movies. This film would probably too boring for you. But if you're looking for a not so typical Bollywood movie...you should really see this one!" 
" Stay away and save yourself from committing a Gunaah to your senses","Believe me guys I am being very liberal while giving the above rating, for the pain and mental suffering I went through while watching this film was much higher. What has been promoted as a love story OF two enemies, should actually have been a love story BY two enemies (of the audiences)  the writer and the director. Did Mahesh Bhatt quit direction just to write such haywire scripts where the story-line constantly dodges from one plot to another? And the suspense element of the film is for the viewer to decide whether the movie is a messy murder mystery OR a bullshit love story OR the regular revenge drama.The hero of the movie, a firefighter turned terrorist-cum-revolutionary, murders somebody who urinated on his father's face. Enter the heroine, an honest police officer who boasts about her daredevil personality stating "Criminals pass urine in their pants on listening my name", soon arrests the hero. Then there is a villain, again a police officer, constantly on the lookout to outwit the heroine, scowling and screaming "If I don't seek my revenge, then urinate on my face". Dunno why every other character in the movie was so anxious to relate himself with the nature's call. Yuck Indeed a very stinky affair.Meanwhile there is also a secret informer ex-constable (appearing more like a foreign beggar begging in some subway) who keeps on giving useless suggestions to the heroine. The song are shot in an intensely irritating way.Bipasha maintains a pesky, grumpy look throughout, puffing and panting endlessly. Thankfully Dino doesn't utters a single word for the first two hours, much to the audiences' relief. Ashutosh Rana gets the least opportunity to ham. Irrfan, the villain, utters the word prostitute in his every single dialog of the movie. And if director Amol Shetge thinks that using expletives in the narrative, can make a scene look more realistic, he should better work on the script and shot execution.Stay away and save yourself from committing a Gunaah to your senses" 
" Unexpected...good.","I always like Bipasha Basu and Dino Morea as a couple, especially when it came to modeling. And I saw them together in "Raaz" and I was like, okay, it was alright. Maybe they shouldn't make movies together. I actually found Bipasha to be better with John Abraham in films like "Jism" and "Aetbaar". However, after seeing "Gunaah" I really was amazed. It's so pure. I totally think one should see it. The fact that Dino has literally no lines in the film, and most of the acting is based on pure chemistry, feeling and eye contact, really does do wonders. There is wonderful acting chemistry between them. It's not very often you can see a pair light up the see like this. The emotional content of the film is truly superb, and I think that's what the real summary of it is. There is action, bad guys, and hidden loves. Go see it!" 
" 10 things better to do","This whole movie itself was a GUNAAH... take my advice if your thinking of seeing this movie1) Watch TV 2) Make out with your partner 3) Or Hire a hooker 4) Go out partying 5) Play Video Games 6) Complete your office work 7) Post comments on IMDb 8) Workout 9) Learn Tai Chi 10)Help AnimalsSee there are so many good and better things to do... than WATCH THIS MOVIE. Bips you are an item girl, stick to it. Dino am sorry that you lost Bips, but you should feel sorry for the audience too. Who sat through this EPIC BORE and mindless junk... . . . . Dino be a model, your good at that...." 
" Strong character and concept","Movie showed true women power. The ending also displayed respect, but would obviously make anyone sad because it's not the typical love story." 
" One of Bhatt's bad films","Vishesh films used to make 3-4 films a year, all low budget films which starred mostly newcomers or one or 2 film olds. GUNAAH brought back Dino and Bips again after the success of RAAZ just few months later. Sadly this time they failed to get a hit. This film brought Irrfan Khan to the limelight though The film was earlier titled ENCOUNTER but perhaps name was changed due to another film ENCOUNTER released in the same year. The film has an okay story of Bips who is an illegitimate daughter of prostitute(very common in Bhatt films) who wants to reform criminals but Irrfan Khan is an encounter specialist.The initial scenes show promise but suddenly we have Bips in low cut dresses romancing Dino and the film falls flat. Slowly things begin to improve with the flashback story but the entire krantikaari track seems half baked. The climax however is well executedDirection by Amol Shetge is average Music is superb, Humne Tumko, Jab Dil Churaye Koi stand out Dino Morea hardly has any dialogues for most of the film and he is okay, the blessing is we are spared to hear his terrible dialogue delivery(perhaps the dubbing artist as in most bhatt films would get a rest this time),Bipasha Basu tries hard and is decent though her voice is dubbedAshutosh Rana is wasted Irrfan Khan excels in his role and it brought him to limelight after small roles in KASOOR which were unnoticed. Yashpal Sharma is okay,Avtar Gill and Vishwajeet Pradhan(Bhatt regulars) are average"
