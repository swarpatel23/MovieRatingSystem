" this blows","How could this get ten out of ten? It's a typical Bollywood movie, and not even a good one. I've seen a lot of these flicks for my work (i'm a journalist), and this is the worst Bollywood production ever. I mean, to name one thing, all the coincidences (fot instance, the last minute abduction!). Look, this movie's release date has been postponed and postponed and postponed, that must ring a bell, doesn't it? The acting's horrible, the music is bad and when it's supposed to be funny, it ain't funny. No, this is not a good movie. I like Bollywood, and i know some good movies (for example Rog and Jism and Xcuse Me), that's why i'm so shocked to find this movie getting such good point. Shame on those 10-voters, who should know better. I give this movie the lowest grade."
