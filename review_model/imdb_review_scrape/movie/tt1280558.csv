" A fascinating high-octane confrontation between two veteran thespians","A Wednesday, are among the best - and bravest - films to come out in 2008. Only one word to describe it: remarkable! A Wednesday tells the story of certain events that take place between 2 and 6 pm on a Wednesday in Mumbai. Events that are not on any record.'A Wednesday,' questions the injustice done to the common man, when innocents meet their end, following bomb blasts. The story rests on the shoulders of two stalwarts, Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah supported ably by Jimmy Shergill and Aamir Bashir. As the city police commissioner, Anupam lends the role dignity and he has executed it brilliantly.Naseeruddin Shah steals the show with his character. Jimmy Shergill is every inch the cool guy. Aamir Bashir leaves a mark too. Even the characters of the four militants has been portrayed well, especially Kali Prasad Mukherjee, the main terroristThere is a reason that has been kept a closely guarded secret! There is a reason why this case has no written proof! There is a reason ..... for everything!" 
" A breathtaking picture that is both relevant, important and entertaining.","What can be said about this film? Like many other films made recently, this one is different from the typical Hindi masala flicks (nothing against them, I think they're wonderful), there are no songs, there is no combination of different genres in one film, it is not a three-hour film. It's a simple, small film of one hour and a half, yet it succeeds to depict an entire world in this limited time.The story begins as an ordinary thriller about a common man who calls the police and informs them about 5 bombs he has allegedly placed all over Mumbai, which he'll get exploded if they don't release four terrorists. The way every scene is carried by the director is very impressive and the dialogues are realistic. The film flows as a great thriller as time passes by, but then unexpectedly becomes into a dramatic story as it unfolds the motives of this common man.The film does not want us to side any party, it wants us to understand the consequences of war, violence and hatred. It wants us to understand how it affects ordinary people. The story is not bigger than life, nor does it intend to be one. The fact that Naseeruddin Shah's character is unnamed only contributes to the universal message of the film.There are many sequences of different people shown in different portions of the film which are just amazing. The one when the officer played by Anupam Kher asks the policeman played by Aamir Bashir about his family status, and his willingness to find the bomb. The guy answers that he's married with a recently born baby girl, yet he'll do anything to find the bomb. Another, when Naseer recalls the young nice guy he met every day in the train, the one who was preparing to marry someone, and gets killed the following day at the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. People must get what happens as a result of terror.The characters in this film are very well defined: a great and respected Police Commissioner, an ambitious journalist, a hot-tempered policeman who takes his job seriously, a common man who feels hurt, and many other policemen who'd give their life for the country. The film depicts national pride and the passion different people have for their work without going to large extents and unnecessary melodrama. It's done in a very realistic manner.The entire cast is wonderful, from leading actors to extras. Naseeruddin Shah does not know how to give a bad performance. He doesn't have to speak a lot or make strange facial expressions to be convincing. He doesn't have to play a grandiose king to make his role bigger than life. His dialogues come from the heart. It is yet another unforgettable performance from Naseer, the one and only. Anupam Kher is restrained and brilliant. The difference between the way he portrays serious yet sensitive men and the way he portrays comic and funny people is thrilling and incredible. Jimmy Shergill is amazing in a small yet pivotal role of a intransigent, hot-tempered, angry, disciplined and serious policeman. So is Aamir Bashir. Deepal Shaw is effective.Well, in conclusion, A Wednesday is an entertaining film with a universal message. Watch it, you'll enjoy it, and you will learn to look at certain things differently." 
" People Don't Know What to Make of This Film","Like many other people, the reason I came to watch "A Wednesday" was because it features in the current IMDB top 250 list. The film was also necessary viewing for the top 250 lists of 2016 and 2017 previously. I was quite confused, and immediately sceptical, as to why this 2008 Indian film was only recently coming into the spotlight. For most other movies, this usually indicates a film of high quality. However, as my 5/10 (average) rating suggests, "A Wednesday" is a film FAR removed from the quality required to merit such a position. It is notable to say that of the 198 films I have seen of the current top 250, this film has received the lowest rating from myself.With that context in mind, I shall now talk about my assessment of the film. The most egregious aspects of "A Wednesday" are definitely in the "action" set pieces. The physical confrontations (one interrogation scene and another chase scene) are woefully uncoordinated to the point of parody. The acting in these scenes fall under heavy scrutiny, unfortunately, as a direct result of this and is entirely unconvincing. The sound editing is perhaps the worst part of these scenes (it sounds like it's come directly from a children's toy/soundboard). It is so jarring that it would have undermined the action scenes even if they had been well choreographed. The special effects are also unconvincing but, since it has a minute presence, it doesn't hinder the film too greatly. I am also unaware if there were budgetary limitations the film had in its making so I don't think it would be entirely fair for me to condemn it for that. Luckily, there is little action to corrupt the entire film but this has led to some reviewers stating that the film is a boring office set piece as a result. I'd be inclined to disagree as the film's premise out with the action offered the greatest potential that the film ultimately failed to fully fulfil. A further, but more pervasive "flaw" is in the film's editing. There is an overabundance of slow-motion footage and abrupt cuts. However, I would say that although the film's editing will come across as a bit cheesy it is still of an adequate quality. This could be as much a case of time working against the film if anything (although I doubt that is the case).I will now address the more positive aspects that the film has to offer. The acting from the main cast is decent for the most part; Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah play the police commissioner (Prakash Rathod) and the "terrorist" known only as "The Common Man" play off of each other well. The script is decent and has some interesting dialogue (one scene comes to mind were Rathod tests his officer's commitment to finding the bombs was a highlight) but I felt that the concept had a lot more potential than its final product. The villain's motivations were interesting and certainly more 3 dimensional than your typical action movie, however, again, I felt that they could have gone into more depth into his character. The conclusion seems to inspire a profound sense of patriotism in the Indian people (hence its high rating) when the two stars finally come together. Whilst understandable, I was a bit disappointed that they didn't go further with the moral conflict here and didn't attempt to provide a more nuanced argument. The film reminded me of the anime "Death Note" to some degree and I was hoping to see a high stakes battle of wits unfold similar to the likes of "L" and "Light Yagami" or between "Sherlock Holmes" and "Moriarty". The secondary villains (a group of terrorists) are played well enough but I felt that they were more 1 dimensional in presentation. I'd also finish by saying that the cinematography for the film is suitably engaging and the camera is dynamic enough to keep your concentration during the film's slower segments.I'd like to finish on a more positive note as I attempt to lend some support to this film. I noticed that "A Wednesday" had a 5.4 rating from the "top 1000 voters" on IMDB with the highest percentage (22.5%) of those giving the film a rating of 1/10. In the same way that I have criticised people who have overrated this film (resulting in its unjust placement in the top 250) I feel that I also need to criticise those who are being equally unreasonable in their negativity. Objectively speaking, this film does a lot of things fairly well and others poorly thus warranting its 5/10 (average) rating from myself. "A Wednesday" is a competently enough made film with a coherent story, decent acting and cinematography etc so it could DEFINITELY be a lot worse. I wonder how many top 1000 voters have seen the IMDB's BOTTOM 100 movies as a frame of reference. I've even seen top 1000 voters give the likes of "Jaws" and "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" 1/10 ratings!To summarise, this film is highly overrated on IMDb and shouldn't be on the top 250. At the same time, it is a decent enough movie which works well enough within its limitations- I doubt "A Wednesday" was made with the intent of becoming an all-time great film! Just a simple, honest thriller. I found it moderately enjoyable, if forgettable, and think it should be recognised as such. I ask South Asian reviewers to seriously reconsider the films that they are trying to promote as the best of Bollywood cinema. Films like this and "Andaz Apna Apna" are really overrated and annoy and scare off Westerners from watching your other films- and that's a massive shame. There are good Bollywood films out there like "3 Idiots" so try and promote these films instead. Please try and consider how your films will resonate with global audiences, I know Westerners should do the same but the sad fact is we can afford to do so because of the more global reach of Hollywood. To address Westerners, don't take out your anger out on the film for its high rating, it's not its fault, so I just ask reviewers to be fair in their assessment. If you're the kind of person to give this film a 1/10 rating just to take it off of the top 250 then you're just being hypocritical! Be consistent and objective in your criticism and, hopefully, this will encourage others to do the same." 
" Great Eye Opener","Great Movie, Good thriller and always maintains the intensity. There is no part in the movie which gets you bored. Its full time Entertainment. The movie is short but up to the point. This is a movie where Naseerudin Shah is like a One Man Army who takes over the whole of Bombay police. I really enjoyed it. We need more movies like this. Very Creative.Technically very correct and the movie has a lot of logic. The Direction is superb. Unlike other movies, there are no songs in the movie. The movie can be viewed by family and even teens and I think its for all type of age groups. The whole movie is like the game of chess. Its a puzzle till the end which bursts out at last releasing a shock wave across the movie theatre." 
" A Must See","There are a few movies that entertain, there are a few movies that give message and then there are a few movies that you can relate to. A Wednesday is definitely one such movie.The story revolves around an anonymous man (Shah) who calls up the commissioner of police (Kher) and informs him about the bombs that he has placed. Bomb blast is something that I personally am scared of. It had ripped Mumbai in 1993 and then in local train and bus. Only people stood by each other. It followed thru out the country. And what can one common man do? . The story line is fantastic. Its hard to believe that this is Neeraj Pandey's first movie and he has taken a gigantic leap without including any songs. The movie itself is only one and a half hours - half of what Bollywood movies usually are. Then he has not shown the police administration either as corrupt or the bookish kind of honest. He has probably taken the real view of police department And then the cast. Naseerudding Shah is one actor who can crawl under the skin of any character. Be it the coach in Iqbal or the pirate in The League of Extra-ordinary gentlemen. Then there is Anupam Kher whose acting abilities are still not tapped to the best by any director. These two stalwarts make-up this movie. And this movie does not have him in a stereo typical dads role. Aamir Bashir as Jay and Jimmy Shergill as Arif are just outstanding. Nothing in the movie is out of context. Well-acted, well-directed, well-scripted, well-executed." 
" Relevant to the current situation in India","I gave an extra point just for the fact that this is relevant cinema. Instead of churning out the next round of mindlessness that earns 140 crores due to the multiplexed masses, this one tries to talk about the current helplessness faced by the common man in India. The topic for discussion is terrorism. The movie begins with a phone call to the Police Commissioner informing him of bombs and asking for the release of 4 terrorists.. The movie then predictably moves into the Negotiator and clock ticking genre.The acting is well done, the plot maybe not that believable but the dialogue at the end is gripping and humane. Naseer and Anupam are as good as they are - no surprises there. There are no songs (GOOD!) and the movie chugs along at an okay pace.. The movie doesn't have a solution... rightly so coz terrorism has none too I believe. It just voices out the anguish of the little the common man expects but has become a rarity now. Expect no hitchcockian twists and you should be happy for the price of your ticket. Certain things that we "get used to" leads to the entire society being trodden upon. Not saying NO at the right time leads to a heavy price in the future. Recommended for a late night snack watch." 
" Nice, tight little masterpiece","I don't think I've smiled so broadly after watching a non-comedy for ages. Sadly, I don't think this is going to set the box-office alight (due to the lack of a bankable star) but it surely lit up my world and I'm going to recommend it to everyone.A man (Naseeruddin Shah) calls up the police HQ, speaks to the Comissioner of Police (Anupam Kher) and advises him that he has planted 5 bombs across Mumbai and will detonate them until his demands are met. The only demand he makes is that four known terrorists are gathered together. All the cops, their intelligence, the Chief Minister etc are not able to trace this person or get any information about him. What does he do next ? Who will win, this unknown person or the wily commissioner, who has all the resources of the state at his disposal ? The movie doesn't really start till about the fortieth minute mark, just plods along till then. But then once it begins, it manages to keep the tension alive very nicely. I haven't seen too many Hindi movies with a central control room or a good cop and bad cop routine (ably played by Aamir and Jimmy respectively) and this one pulls off both quite nicely. Also, it thankfully remains focused on the plot and doesn't deviate for any item songs or normal songs or romantic interludes. There are several nice touches as well  the CM's exclamation, 'He Parmeswara', when informed about the crisis. The whole 'Electric Baba' thing. Or the way the terrorists identify themselves to Naseer (will let you find that out for yourself) or the way the director litters a few red herrings around. Great acting by everyone, great editing and camera work and very well put together.I've had similar thoughts as the film's lead character a few times. Maybe not as drastic but getting there, give me time, this film has merely watered a germinating seed. I would love to talk more, expound on what I'm feeling but am forcing myself to desist. This is one of the pleasures of being a reviewer, the ability to introduce a rare, hidden gem to the audience. Please see it before you find out how it ends.

" The worst movie of the top 250","What makes a good movie? I say a good movie should have good acting, good sound production, good camera work, good plot, be well directed and so on. What makes a "top 250 grade" movie? Wonderful acting, amazing sound production, astonishing camera work, really unique plot and to be directed by someone who has outstanding talent. And this movie isn't even good. Why? The only thing it has is some kind of a "message". Well, having a message is not enough. It doesn't have anything a movie should have. Acting is just awful, especially the fighting scenes. Music sounds out of place and cartoon punching sounds are just ridiculous. Camera work is strange. Plot is average, or slightly above. And i won't even say anything about the director.First of all, this movie looks like a cheap TV drama. And i know it has low budget. But making shots of a cat getting thrown from around the corner or ridiculous fighting scenes with cartoon sounds has nothing to do with money, it's a matter of taste. Those who made the movie just don't have it.Next, CGI. Yes, it does have it. But it would be much better if it didn't. Because showing the audience some strange black silhouettes unnaturally flying out of an explosion doesn't make the movie look more believable, it makes it laughable. Well, CGI costs money. Congratulations to the creators of the movie - they found the worst way to waste it. Because if you don't have enough money to do good special effects, you shouldn't probably do them at all.Also, introducing a superhero-cop character in a movie that is supposed to be an intense moderately realistic thriller with some drama mixed in wasn't such a good idea.So, as a result we have a movie that looks bad, sounds bad and feels bad. However, it's kinda useful - without it i would've never known what a really awful movie actually is. This one makes a great reference.I've never actually written a review before. And what made me do it is the fact that this movie somehow made it to the top 250. Believe me, it doesn't belong there. Just doesn't. It's a shame that some site users do not want to rate movies according to their quality, but rather use the flaws of the rating system to push movies from their country to the top just because they want to." 
" Excellent movie, apt review.","Brilliant movie. A complete and wholesome masterpiece. A realistic and commendable approach to the ticking time bomb that is the resilience of the Mumbai population. I hope movies such as this, "Aamir", "Mumbai Meri Jaan" and others of this rank keep coming because movies such as these makes me proud of the Indian cinema fraternity.The acting done by greats like Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah cannot go unnoticed. The movie has a rather slow pace in the beginning but with time the movie grips and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Watch out for excellent dialogs exchanged in the end of the movie. Noteworthy performance by Jimmy Shergill and Aamir Bashir.An absolute must-watch for everyone." 
" Ehm...movie about...people walking in a corridors?","While I understand A Wednesday did some good job in heavy uplifting patriotism, is it enough for it to be placed into top 250? I do not think so. I see most of the reviews are a bit, how to put it, "overly-benevolent", I suppose written by people moved by the message.While movie have some interesting moments, it is slow paced, unimaginative, predictable, unrealistic and in my opinion, too long. Come on, I feel like 75% of all scenes was just a cops and politicians playing important while heroic music plays - that's it - good guys walking in a corridor (lot of corridors out there, believe me) and music, talking to a phone (you mostly cannot hear what they are saying) and music, waiting in a car and music, sitting, standing and so on. But the story was there, it just the movie should have been shorter by half. Occasional action is laughable. That is said, if you can call a scene of a some sort of cop beating some sort of thug into a pulp with his 90's midi sound waves superpower (checked, nobody came to any real harm for sure) an action. But short laugh usually came to end shortly afterwards, as some pretty nasty humiliating moments happened to the bad guys (they all are...bad guys...right?), which made me a bit sick (hooray - true emotion).So to wrap it up, it is a movie showing message of hatred to the bad guys. You hate them bad guys? Then it is a chance you will enjoy this movie. I know terrorism and stuff is a bad thing and so on - OK, but make a quality movie about it, then I bet it will be welcomed into top 250 with open arms." 
" An Engrossing Affair!","A Wednesday' is a brave attempt which makes a commentary about the social and political fabric of India. In the recent past, many Hindi movies have treaded along this path and sought to bring in a revolution in at least the way people think about issues. 'A Wednesday' is a welcome addition to that league.It mocks the government, reminding it of the duties it ought to be performing as the caretaker of the common people. Another thumbs up for showing the power of the common man and stating in no uncertain terms that religion is secondary to nationality.And the best part is that all this social commentary isn't preachy so to speak. All this is a byproduct of an engrossing edge of the seat thriller with great performances by veterans - Nasseruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. Even the lesser knowns - Jimmy Shergill, Aamir Bashir and Deepal Shaw shine in impactful roles.A well scripted affair; it has some masala and cheesy lines which has enough juice to get the sub-urban masses whistling.It caters to every Indian -- Niche or Urban and should not be missed." 
" A Wednesday in a lifetime","IT IS TRUE WHAT THEY SAY about greatness. It is always meant to be. No amount of planning or foresight or pundits with beards longer than their hands can ever truly make someone something one is not. If one is destined to be great  one is. Most times one wonders how much more one has to shout and scream so that people can take notice while other timeswell, other times silences creep in so beautifully that we hardly recognize them and something breathe taking has already been created.Before, dear reader, the assumption is made that I am off on a track quite abstract to the common man  ah, that word suddenly sounds so powerful  let me underline the topic I have chosen. I was browsing through my usual collection of review websites when I happened to get a glimpse of one interesting review. It was for a movie I had never heard of. Neither had I ever seen any publicity posters of it nor had I guessed it would feature two of my all time favorites  Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. The fact that no one else, except maybe the highly underestimated Jimmy Shergill, was even remotely recognizable on the credit list apart from these three did not deter me from giving it a shot. Bollywood these days is being showered with 'alternate' cinema that runs a delicate line between commercial masala-fundas and the documentary type approaches. In such a rain it is easy to miss some true refreshingly different rain drops. Having shied away from such features for a while, I decided to give this a look-see since I knew Naseer and Anupam would definitely make it worth my time. With that random assumption, I began watching 'A Wednesday'.Two hours laterI was going through a very rare feeling. I did not understand it initially since it had been such a long time but then, I knew. It was the same bunch of emotions I had felt when I had seen the climax of 'The Sixth Sense'. It was the same 'Oh wow!' feeling that had pierced my veins as the final few minutes of 'The Usual Suspects' drowned in my eyes. It was the very unique gut sense of genuine enthusiasm I had felt when I finally understood 'Momento' in its last frame.But, this time it was different. I had never felt such a tingle in my heart for a Hindi movie in many years. Sure, I have had my share of laughs and appreciation for some decent Indian cinema over the years, but there was never anything in them that made me say to myself 'he is so rightthis could happen to me tootodaytomorrowany day' since there was never any context. What 'A Wednesday' successfully did was pick me up from my starry eyed slumber and slap a 'REALITY CHECK' sticker on my face. It reminded me of the times we are part of. It made me wonder about my own life and how unsure things are in the world we live in. It, if not anything else, made me think.I am sure people often sigh and yawn about movies that make them 'think' since it is exactly the opposite reason of why one would watch a movie. No one wants to see relevant issues these days. There is a huge fan following for the larger than life, escapist features which come and go every week. We Indians, the world's best consumers, lap it up in all our glee not caring about if it had anything to do with our life. Why? Since it does not matter. It never does, does it? But then how long can we keep doing this? Once in a while we do need that refreshing slap on the face that makes us realize who we really are. And what a wonderful slap this was! No better way to bring me back to reality than a movie like this one. I was applauding myself for having taken a chance and seen one of the most relevant movies of our times. A silent yet beautiful effort at capturing human emotion on the screen. To summarize in one word  great.Do yourself a favor  watch 'A Wednesday'. A must see for every Indian according to me. If not anything else it will definitely catch you by surprise! I strongly recommend this movie to everyone who has ever sat back and said 'I wish things were different'" 
" Instant Classic!","They asked us on Friday, repeated on Tuesday...I am just replying back on A Wednesday. If someone asked me after the movie about what i had witnessed, I would say a work of brilliance.This is a movie that has made me happy and feel good literally and i mean it by each of my words.A Wednesday is a movie based on the repeated terrorist attacks made in different parts of India time and time again and its aftermath which makes the life of a common individual living amongst us the most painful and uncomfortable and how this common individual decides to respond to these hellish acts.I won't reveal the plot for those who haven't watched the movie yet but i would certainly say watch it and come up with your own views about it because If you happen to be an Indian who knows what exactly takes place in our country, you'll come up with the same statements that i had made earlier.About the making,the performances that stood out would be, hands down, that of both Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher but Mr Shah was at his usual stupendous best.His performance was simply exceptional and showed his genius.Jimmy shergill with Aamir bashir and the other actors also filled in brilliantly.The cinematography and screenplay were brilliant. The pace of the movie in accordance with its plot was picture perfect and terrific but the thing that stood out about the movie was its thrill and drama that captivated the audience along with its pace and storyline.The climax drawn was also outstanding and the director was immaculate with his work of direction. The most wonderful thing about this movie is that the whole plot runs by taking the audience and the viewers along with it and towards the end,the climax brings and involves the audience deep into the theme of the movie and makes one feel oneself as the most important part of it. The movie is just one of those instant classics( I dare say) that will probably never be a big hit for no good reason and yet show that if really desired an excellent small work of art can be made.I am no movie critic and as I write my comments, I write these entirely being based on the mindset of a big movie fan and viewer who has just seen a movie that has made him feel happy and so he expresses his views to all of you.Friends, if you want my recommendation for it, I'd say..Anyday, A Wednesday.Watch it, You'll love it." 
" Truly excellent movie","I loved this movie as it was one of those very movies which are meant not for entertainment but for enlightenment.. Watch it and then you will know what I mean to say.. it is me who thinks like this, it is you who think like this, it is all of us!! For us(especially in India)..we have similar situation and yet we will watch this movie and forget it after sometime..!! We also think the same way as the lead person of this movie thinks, we all want to do the same but then, we are the same very stupid common men, we can't do anything except watching this movie and recommending it to others.. its not like I will also do something which the common man did in the movie.!! we have several constraints in our lives, we do not bother giving a thought to these problems. What writer wants us to see is the truth that every man thinks , the fear that everybody has in his mind regarding today's situation.... do yourself a favor..watch out this movie!!" 
" "When's day"","So when's that day??? When we will rise like phoenix from the ashes.......So cutting it out to the movie........First lets talk about the movie...... Movie per se is too good and I was moved by the very idea of the movie. As i am not checking the spoiler box, I must be brief......Though the movie is incomparable and nothing can be said without exposing the plot. Now I can easily say that Bollywood is showing some of its traits that can be compared to a Hollywood movie. The idea of the movie is among the best I have ever seen. This movie should go for Oscars not involving any kind of politics this time.Lets see what can be said about the components of the movie, to start with we have 2 of the greatest Bollywood actor in the movie and chosen aptly for the roles. The four terrorists are chosen correctly for the role and also their getup is quite nice and appropriate. In the acting department only Deepal Shaw has shown some weakness, otherwise all the actors for big and small roles have shown their skills. Screenplay is good with too many story running simultaneously at the start of the movie. Cinematography is also fine with the scenes on the road, from the streets and all, also appreciable amount of money has been spent on it too. Background score is a bit too loud but some may find it appropriate but its not.....Editing is nice enough as the coherence is evident in the movie. Now what ..... the king of all ...... Mr Niraj, the director of the movie, he has done a great job by managing all the accoutrement on his back and using the right card at the right time.........This movie has an effect and is generally followed by a deep thinking........ "When there's a match between India and Pakistan.....and when India loses ... ESPN & STAR SPORTS are not blamed" It simply says that stop blaming the accessory, take the responsibility of failure, then only you deserve the accolades." 
" It was A Wednesday!!!",""That bastard just had guts to walk into our lives and blow it apart. It was A Wednesday!"It is very difficult to comment on this movie without revealing the Spoiler, So I Keep it Short.If you liked Satya, Black Friday and Mumbai Meri Jaan you are in for a treat.A Wednesday is one of the best movies in recent times. Its a hard-hitting thriller, great execution of the script by the director.No amount of praise would be enough for the performance. WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!"
