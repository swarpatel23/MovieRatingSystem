" Bollywhat","This film is a gem and I have encouraged friends to watch this movie. It is not the writing that produces laughs-- in that area, it is rather lackluster. However, the overacting, the overall craziness of the film had me in tears. In addition, it is impossible to not laugh during the first scene. Most films have been scored using multiple songs. This film uses the same song throughout the movie and it couldn't be funnier. Govinda and Dutt are horrible dancers and they make this painfully obvious throughout the film. Additionally, if you watch it subtitled in English, you may find some scenes particularly hilarious on another level. The dialog was spoken in English, yet the subtitles are grammatically different. Ek Aur Ek Gyarah has a special place in my cabinet of films. I am rather surprised that this film has not attained cult status." 
" A Big Avoid!!","Flashback: David Dhawan was the happening thing in Bollywood. "Govinda + David Dhawan" was the enviable combo that even the Big B stooped down to be a part of it and tried his hand with D. Dhawan on the director's seat.Present: When the best of the Bollywood movies are biting the dust, the director cans the film with a misnomer that the audience will bite any bones thrown.The truth: audience bites back!! I cannot decide which was worse, the story or the execution. A few scenes were inspired from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.Abundance use of punjabi language in the movie only add to the woes. The heroines are displayed in their lowest necklines utilised only for free skin-show. Heroines acting department: big ZERO.Advice:: David Dhawan: If you don't re-invent yourself, you might as well start looking for the nearest Jurassic Park.Govinda: Off-late your comedy is "utter" rubbish. And you better do something about your "paunch" Uncle!! Sanju Baba: Forget doing favours to your buddies. Do yourself a favour and choose good scripts.Subash Ghai: As a Chairman and Managing Director of Mukta Arts public limited company the investors expect you to be professional. Obviously, you are not keeping a tab on the production notes!!! Verdict: Disappointment was not the nearest word on my mind - suicide, perhaps." 
" Hideous","Govinda, Sanjay Dutt, DD gave together Haseena Maan Jayegi and Jodi No.1 both not that great films but good entertainers and made money however their comeback EAEG is such a dud it makes you cry.... First of all, the characters are the same from Jodi No.1 and both are so loud and intolerable that the gags fall flat. The ease at which things happen here are tough to digest, the romance angle is half baked, the villains are reduced to jokers and the climax is flatDirection by DD is horrible Music by SEL is okay, Oh Dushmana is good, some other songs too are tuneful Govinda - manages many comic scenes well but his shouting gets to the nerves Sanjay Dutt - Plays second fiddle to Govinda(he always did) though there is improvement. Amongst heroines, Amrita Arora is nothing great but Nandini Singh irritates Rajpal Yadav is as usual good, Ashish Vidyarthi repeats his buffoonery he did in DD films, Gulshan Grover is hardly menacing Jackie Shroff looks jaded, Ajay Nagrath and rest are okay."
