" Very enjoyable, nice to see Sushmita so good (in all ways)","I bought this movie with several other Bollywood flicks and didn't know what to expect from it. I liked it from beginning to end. Yes it's another un-believable Bollywood story, but if you watch this movie you know what to expect. The characters are reasonably well developed, even their motivations are well developed. Sushmita / Shimmer is the center character, making all others meet and interact. Her character is a celebrity hungry top model, but she soon befriends a young woman who was deceived by her new husband, who happens to be Shimmer's best friend. Then the Bollywood effect occurs and situations go on as characters have to react to them and delve into their inner feelings. The whole thing is well acted, led by Sushmita with strength and class (and awesome beauty)." 
" Dulha Mil Gaya... and then what went wrong?","Mudassar Aziz's maiden venture Dulha Mil Gaya has finally been completed. It's always important to give first-time directors a little leeway for errors. Direction may not be rocket science but debut projects often has some raw edges.Mudassar was lucky enough to cast Sushmita Sen and Shah Rukh Khan together. These two nearly set the screen on fire with their sizzling chemistry in Main Hoon Na.DMG also stars Fardeen Khan and veterans like Johnny Lever and Parikshit Sahni. With such a talented cast the least one expected was a fun, watchable film. Unfortunately, DMG reminded me of a film which keeps taxiing down the runway but never really takes off.The film opens in Trinidad with a spoiled brat son, who hopes to inherit millions from his deceased father's estate. But Tej Dhanraj, also known as Donsai (Fardeen Khan), is in for a rude shock. He has just a few days time to marry Samarpreet Kapoor (Ishitta Sharrma), a girl from rural Punjab.This is a theme which was hugely popular in romance novels and movies in the 1960s and 1970s. The director could have kept us engrossed by taking the story to a new level. But Mudassar Aziz sticks to the tried-and-tested. Samarpreet remains the 'sati savitri' type, who will go to any lengths to woo her husband.But this Herculean task cannot be managed single-handedly. So Samarpreet receives help from Shimmer (Sushmita Sen) and Pawan Raj Gandhi (SRK). Shimmer is ashamed of Donsai's behavior. She hopes to reform him but fails to realize that she is equally commitment phobic. Mudassar in text-book fashion introduces his characters in the first 30 minutes and then for the next two hours, the film keeps plodding its way towards a dreary, predictable end.All the characters in the film are flat and one-dimensional. Fardeen Khan, the playboy, has fared well in comic situations with his earlier hits such as Heyy Babyy and No Entry. But his performance here can't be compared to those. He has gained a lot of weight and appears bloated in most scenes. The weight gain hasn't just affected his appearance; his gait too is more suitable to that of a middle-aged man rather than a dashing playboy.Newcomer Ishitta Sharma appears convincing as the soft-spoken rural Punjabi girl. Unfortunately, she lacks the oomph factor which is so necessary for her character in the second half of the film. Despite this obvious flaw, she remains one of the most convincing characters.Sushmita Sen seems to be earning more and more flak for herself these days. This is probably her worst performance till date, maybe with the exception of Zindaggi Rocks. The verve and the zest, which has always been such an intrinsic part of her personality, seem to have disappeared. The same eyes, which oozed sensuality, now emanate a sense of fatigue and boredom.Watching Johnny Lever on screen has always been a treat for his fans. But he appears in a blink-and-miss role here. It seems such a waste for an actor of his caliber. But obviously, the director thought differently.Shah Rukh Khan is a man who has always obliged his friends. Producer Vivek Vaswani had helped SRK find his feet when the latter was a struggler. But SRK is completely wasted in the film even though he tries hard to liven up the screen with his presence.SRK plays a millionaire whose only desire is to see Sushmita smile. There is one sequence where he jumps off a cruise liner to rescue a toy dog. In one word: absurd.Even to the untrained eye, it's obvious that the film took many years to be completed. There are scenes where Sushmita Sen and Fardeen look slim. And in the very next sequence, their physical appearance changes drastically. An experienced cinematographer can easily avoid these pitfalls; this is not the first film which took over three years to be completed. But the lighting and cinematography is easily the tackiest one has seen in recent times.The West Indies and Trinidad are scenic and breathtaking. These locations haven't been used too often in our films. But no film has ever managed to sustain itself on the basis of its locations.Watch the film if you can't think of any other way to spend your weekend. Or else just avoid." 
" Silly but watchable","o.k. So this movie was lacking in the dialog department. Also it is over-the-top in a way that only Bollywood can carry off. Unfortunately it is difficult to tell in this movie if the silly melodrama is the plan or if the directing was abysmal. None-the-less, in a year of mediocre movies I enjoyed it. The stories are interesting. The younger female role, played by Ishitta Sharma was acted with sensitivity. The friendship between Shimmer (Sushmita) and Samara (Ishitta) was interesting. But it is the scenes between Shushmita Sen and Shahrukh Khan that make this movie. Shahrukh plays his character straight in this very melodramatic film and it proves to be the saving of what would otherwise have been an unwatchable film. The scenes between him and Shushmita are touching and fun and their story makes the movie." 
" what a Surprise","First of all Iam not a Fardeen Khan or Sushmita Sen fan....and this movie was the last choice to see on a Boring day.And what a surprise....This movie was actually good....Sushmita Sen acted so good, and looked so good and even Fardeen Khan was good in the movie.BUT the scene stealer was the new girl....she is Beautiful...and her acting was top-notch....Iam sure we will see more of her in Bollwywood, and maybe she might be one of the Top ladies in Bollywood.The story has been seen before BUT still this movie has soul, and that made it good...and SRK's role was actually very good.all in all a Very good surprise, I went to the cinema for killing 2.5 hours and came out with a smile and a good experience.Forget VEER, this movie is much better." 
" Not even Sushmita Sen and Shah Rukh Khan can save an abysmal script.","Shah Rukh Khan and Sushmita Sen are fun to see together again, but this movie has an abysmal script with inept direction and a hodgepodge of superficially presented topics. We went to see it only because of the SRK "special appearance," which makes the second half entertaining when he is on screen. Take him off screen, however, and the movie falls into the holes the director digs for the cast with slapstick taking the place of subtlety in scene after scene. Sushmita Sen surely deserves a better vehicle for her talents. As always, SRK generously does his best with his role, but we wonder if he had any regrets after seeing the final product, a movie that we bet will be out of theaters soon." 
" Very awful movie, in any way.","My wife is a die hard Sharukh Khan fan, and even though Sharukh has a small performance in this movie, we had to see this one. Mostly Sharukh is a guarantee for a good movie. Not this time.The story is very poor. Fardeen Khan plays a player who has to marry Ishitta Sharma in order to get money from his father's will. He marries her, but only for his father's money and leaves the girl in her village. This girl transforms from Clark Kent to Superman. Is was great in 1978, but nowadays we don't swallow this crap anymore as an audience.I never liked Sushmita Sen as an actress and this movie doesn't change that feeling a bit. She acts very poor and it's very strange that there blows a wind indoor everywhere where she is and is blows only through her hair and not through the hair of other women. I don't get that from Bollywood movies; why does the wind have to blow through peoples hair when they are inside a building???Sharukh Khan has grown old. He still acts clumsy and is not refreshing. We still watch movies from him like DDLJ, KANK, Darr and so on. It's a pity we cannot enjoy his new movies because they are crap. Also the part he jumped into the ocean to get a dog toy from Sushmita was very stupid. What audience swallows this crap? It's like a standard Bollywood high school movie where a student can play the guitar because that should be cool. It might be, but it is not the reality. Like Hritik Roshan drives a Lamborghini when he goes to college in KKKG but still cannot tie his shoelaces.Ishitta Sharma is a beautiful girl, good as a model but not good enough as an actress. But in Bollywood mostly it is as an actress enough to be beautiful while you lack of acting skills, like Bipasha Basu or Priyanka Chopra. I can compare her performance with the performance of Jessica Alba and that's not a compliment.The way Fardeen Khan dumps his newly wedded wife and tries to hit on her while he does not know he already is married to her and Ishitta Sharma wants to win his love for her is very crazy and stupid. In what kind of world do these people live in? Blinded by money? When Fardeen Khan is drunk on the boat and shouts to Sharukh everybody listens to him. In real life nobody would listen to a drunk fool. And why did Fardeen want to give his mother's diary to "just a girl". Like this girl is interested in what his mother has written. No, she doesn't give a "peep".What a terrible movie. Sharukh doesn't make many movies nowadays and when he does make a movie I expect a lot of it. It's a pity he cannot keep the level we are used from him. Maybe he shouldn't have signed for this role at all, but that he should have signed for the role in Slumdog Millionaire. But his loss is a gain for an other magnificent actor." 
" Shallow, mind-numbing, not even SRK wants to be there","hands down one of the worst Bolly movies I've watched in a while, if not ever. Predictable. Boring, Shallow. The songs are meh. The acting is really awful. The stereotypes makes your eyes water. Putting SRK on the poster is stupid, since he basically features all of 10 minutes.The story is highly predictable. Not even an interesting or smart twist anywhere.The characters are not believable. This is the first time I've seen Fardeen Khan, and I hope to never again. I enjoy Sushmita Sen, and I really loved her in Main Hoon Na, but here, her character is loathsome. Her character is not explored, and the tiny bit of change at the end, is not enough to redeem her. Samarpreet's Pretty Woman transformation is totally ridiculous. A blind man with a cane could tell she's the same girl.The only characters I had an iota of emotional connection with, was Samarpreet's aunt and uncle.Donsai's character development is unrealistic. Hussain Bhai was a way better human being than Donsai will ever be.SRK, for all his awesomeness, couldn't even pull this out of the dustbin. You could see on his face he didn't want to be there.Kind of annoyed that I spent data on buying this movie." 
" My take on Dulha Mil Gaya","Since I discovered Bollywood when I arrived to Holland, found out they were subtitled in English,, so over the last 13 years I have been collecting them, last weekend I stumbled over a huge box full of Bollywood DVDs so hubby bought them for me, among the DVDs in the box was this film I am reviewing,I found it delightful, I am a huge SRK fan, I think he gets better with age LOL But to be honest the "leading man" was a disappointment, the young actress that played his Punjab wife was lovely and quite good ..I look forward seeing more of her. I loved the costumes that Shimmer wore, she had such beautiful clothes. I am a bit confused,I thought the movie took place in Miami Florida, but some one said Trinidad. I rate this a seven, it was a perfect movie for a rainy day." 
" Don't waste your time","A complete waste of time. Where you want to see your stars to surprise you and you get greatly disappointment in return. I don't know why SRK accepted this script but we know about Fardeen Khan as he get very little in good roles. On the part of Sushmita, she has once again disappointed the audience. Because people love to see her but at the same time we would love to see her acting, at least some inprovements in it. The story line is really weak. Having no surprises no thrill at all. Actually the movie is a mixture of some previous Bollywood movies. After watching the movie I thought the whole team just wanted to make a movie for fun with no expectations and they were quite successful in their try. I hope everyone in the Bollywood learn something from the real King Amir Khan to pursue perfection."
