" Corny from start to end...","Brace yourself for one of the biggest Bollywood chick-flicks in recent history. Although I seriously doubt how many chicks will really like this movie!!! First of all, I'm not sure if this movie was intended to be a parody of all the classic Bollywood love stories or that is just wanted to use the clichés for the entertainment factor. I cannot understand that when the lead pair is good looking young and reasonably talented, why would the director not put more effort into making an original love story? We have been subjected to Hollywood rip offs for so long.....but seriously Mr Director, Bollywood rip offs are in no way better!!! For heavens sake, let the classics remain classics. With the exception of the opening scenes of the film which revive memories of some of the hit love stories of the past (DDLJ, Dil Kehta Hai and Hum Tum), I didn't see the point of making any further reference to past movies. The director has tried to humorously incorporate all the clichés of the great Bollywood love stories and tried to give it a modern twist (as in Om Shanti Om)......but unfortunately, there is nothing new or "different" about this movie. It just didn't work.Sonam is as cute as a button. She is surely one of the most beautiful actresses we have in our industry today. Her character however is silly and superficial. Imran is cool and can easily pass of for the playboy types but he seriously needs to learn how to emote. He does well in the scenes where he is supposed to be cool and funny but when the time comes for him to profess his love, he might as well be talking to a wall! I hope he takes some tips from his famous "maamu". I wish I could say that I loved the chemistry between the lead pair....but I would be lying through my teeth. And please, what was with Soman's loser BF always color coordinating his clothes with her?? Is that supposed to indicate the depth of love or something?? The trait of a good director is to put his/her point across without being ridiculous in the process! The reason I gave this movie 5 stars (I am being extremely generous here) is because I think both Sonam and Imran look great and have the potential to be good actors, some of the humorous dialogues were original, the music of the film is hummable, Imran's fat friend was funny at times and the cinematography was generally good." 
" If you're not a teenage girl with questionable taste...","...then don't bother.First, the actors. Sonam Kapoor has the IQ of a paper bag. And that's when I'm drunk enough not to notice. It's so bad it actually shows anytime she's not flashing her perfect whites. First day in acting school: Don't make it look like you're acting. Looks like someone was absent. Imran Khan showed great promise in Jaane tu... Here he's a clichéd wannabe. The jokes are forced and everything else seems artificial. What the fungus, dude?Second, the premise. Confused Boy + Girl. Confused Girl + Boy. And every single love story platitude thrown in the middle. That with the grating self promotional music everywhere. We get it, Mr. Johar, you're a fan. Of yourself.Third, the bulls***. Do you really meet on strategically placed rocks every time you need to have a serious relationship talk? And Raj, are you FRIGGIN' BLIND? Also, why are beautiful women (read:Giselle) so irritating? Is there a law?I'm a little sad that the quality of Indian Cinema has dropped to this level. I wish they'd start putting in a little more intelligence in their movies over simple polish. Would love to sit through a movie that didn't make me want to strangle defenseless rabbits in slow motion.2 out of 10. 1 for the fat guy with the sexist humour." 
" It was 57 hours long","Man! This movie was so boring. The best part about it was the trailer. It went downhill from there. For a movie trying to be a spoof on love stories, it bombed by stating how much it hates luv stories ... constantly! It just drags, the film should have been half its size. The main problem is that nothing happens! They keep repeating the same point over and over again. Also there was no real chemistry between the lead pair. There were a few funny dialogues but not enough to save the film. Imran Khan delivers his dialogues really well (except for a couple of scenes where I thought he actually wanted to laugh). Sonam should hang up her acting hat. She wouldn't know how to say a sentence with emotion if it came and bit her in the you know where. Best advice: stay at home. watch it when it comes on TV, so that you can change the channel, when you see Imran doing the same thing for the 237th time." 
" A youthful movie in looks but too old & dull in content.","To begin with I would like to mention all the young and energetic names associated with this movie. First of its reputed banner of Karan Johar, who himself is known as a Master of Love Stories. Secondly, it is directed by a debutant young director, Punit Malhotra, who is the nephew of famous fashion designer Manish Malhotra. And then it has the two most energetic & talented names, Imran Khan & Sonam Kapoor who look adorable as a couple on the screen. So obviously, one is forced to expect something new, fresh and novel in terms of content from a talented ensemble like this.But shockingly, what is served is neither something new nor it has any kind of fresh or innovative treatment given by the director to captivate his audience. Very unexpectedly the film is as predictable as the night coming after the day. In straight words, the only USP of the movie is its fresh paring of the lead actors and thats it.Before the intermission, the proceedings are cute and the sequences are fine but you simply keep watching them only because you are expecting something new to unfold on the screen any moment. But nothing happens of that sort and post interval the film moves on to the same ages old path of realizing the mistakes and returning to the lady love as usual. However the director does throw few funny one liner dialogues and some comic sequences to give you the much required relief at regular intervals. But that's really not enough for the hungry viewers who were expecting a lot from this big movie. Talking about the storyline, you can easily guess it by only looking at its various posters for a while. The plot of hatred (within a young couple working together) getting converted into love is known to the Indian Viewers as Rice in their daily meals. Interestingly, both Imran Khan and Sonam Kapoor have only few releases to their credits till now and they are also known for their extremely choosy nature and rejection of scripts after their recent flops. But I simply couldn't understand that out of all the scripts being offered to them, why did they choose this particular one, which was only a rehashed version of many other HIT Love stories of the past and had nothing of its own as original. May be the director also convinced his producers on the basis of some new kind of treatment he had in mind for the over-used plot. But unfortunately, the fresh treatment is not visible on the screen in any frame and he completely misses the big opportunity given to him by the makers.Coming to the other aspects of the film, it no doubt excels in its technical departments namely in its Styling, Cinematography, Production Values and the Soundtrack. But sadly, everything else takes a back seat if you have nothing to offer as far as the main content of the movie goes.Imran Khan looks fine in both aspects of his character but again why did he agree to do a role quite similar to the one he had already done in "Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na". Sonam looks amazing on the screen and has a fresh magnetic power in her beauty. She performs well in her role of a Set Designer, but with not a single HIT in her career till now, she got to be extra cautious to choose her future projects after IHLS. Samir Soni, who plays a Bollywood director in the movie (resembling Sanjay Leela Bhansal's persona) is OK. Samir Dattani underplays it well playing Sonam's boyfriend. Aamir Ali as the HERO is impressive but Pooja Ghai as the HEROINE doesn't get enough lines or scenes. Ketaki Dave & Anju Mahendru too have nothing much to do in the screenplay. But out of the entire supporting cast, Bruna Abdullah and Kavin Dave (of "Sprite Commercial" fame) truly stand out. In reality, the most enjoyable scenes of the movie are the ones featuring Kavin Dave as Imran's friend.Musically, IHLS holds the merit with few good numbers composed by Vishal-Shekhar, out of which the Title Track is surely the best. The Background score also proves its presence in the movie smartly. Another engaging aspect of IHLS is that throughout its entire screenplay, the characters keep pointing towards some big names in a taunting way. The movie starts with the actual film clipping of the Three Khans and there are continuous references to Sanjay Leela Bhansali and his movies such as "Saawariya" & "Devdas". May be the writers were following the real life story of Sonam Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor, who did actually worked as assistant directors to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, at the start of their careers. A particular scene also talks about Aamir Khan and his "Lagaan", along with a dialogue pointing towards his forthcoming home production "Peepli Live". And there are paintings and dance sequences used in the movie, similar to Karan Johar's "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham".But here the strange paradox is that even after sarcastically talking about all the big names and Hit movies in his film, the director Puneet Malhotra, himself comes out with a product which is quite mediocre in execution and content in comparison to all. In other words, a debutant director like him should have essentially worked on his own project first to prove his caliber, before making mockery of some reputed names of the Industry.To sum up, if you can appreciate love stories made with the same seen before familiar moves and if you really rate the star-cast more important than the movie itself, then you may like IHLS. But for me it's a project which had some great potential only before its release. Sharing a common theme with the 2009 release "I Hate Valentine's Day", it comprises of only one visual treat and that's Sonam Kapoor alone." 
" A Nutshell Review: I Hate Luv Storys","The title plays up on how unbelievable love stories can get, and despite its ripping apart the classical romantic films by Dharma Productions and Yash Raj films in the opening, and throughout the film, ultimately this one proves to be quite hypocritical in a sense that it too cannot come to grips with its battle against cliché, and falls prey to the tried, tested and tired formula of a romantic comedy. As the saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them.However it has its youthful, eye candy cast added to its advantage as it plods through its rather meandering and cumbersome plot, involving J (Imran Khan), a production assistant who has worked on countless of romantic films by hotshot director Veer Kapoor (Samir Soni), and Simran (Sonam Kapoor), who is employed under the same production umbrella. To J, work means a constant rolling of the eyes because he just doesn't subscribe to nor see the appeal of formulaic romantic movies, even if his employer is the best in the business. And for Simran it's just the reverse, feeling privileged to be part of movie magic, as she expounds her own blissfully perfect relationship with fiancé Raj (Sammir Dattani).So begins the clash of the believer and the non-believer, made worst when J is ordered to be working under Simran who is the new art director for Veer's upcoming love saga, Pyar Pyar Pyar, which I have to admit that writer-director Punit Malhotra managed to weave in a film in production within a film, that drew nice touches of parallels between J and Simran's developing love affair, until the final act which somehow had to conform to hammed up clichés. On one hand, I thought it was quite brilliant to get the audience engaged through two levels, one which is the reality the characters live in, and the other the ultra-hyped film reality which exists in Pyar Pyar Pyar, with extremely over the top performances and delivery used to elicit plenty of laughter, especially from fans of Bollywood romances.We'd expect the usual clash of the opposites, where J the non-committal playboy unwittingly turns on his charm on the on-the-way-to-blissful-marriage Simran, who by the time the interval rolled by, is at odds with wanting to settle down with the man she thought will provide that level of stability through routine, or someone who's more of the livewire even if you started out hating the guts of the person? The story seems to play on the theme of close proximity having that big a role to play in demolishing stability, and like all nicely crafted clichés which you can see coming from a mile away, J and Simran inevitably fall in love, which takes one of them by surprise, leading to plot development reserved for after the interval.If not for the young film starlets as the leads, it'll be quite hard to imagine how love can make them do silly things, with plenty of assumptions drawn up that the characters inevitably fall for. Nothing new gets added to the flavour of the story, and while it doesn't stand out, it also doesn't fall flat on its face as well, making this a simple, breezy romantic tale to sit through. Imran Khan pulls through his J quite effortlessly, since I suppose the easy-going, good natured guy is almost always easier to play as opposed to Sonam Kapoor's emotional Simran, who has ample opportunity to show her acting chops in what's only her third major role in her film career, compared to contemporary peers such as Ranbir Kapoor, or even Deepika Padukone.Perhaps the only thread of interest here to sustain your attention will be the numerous film references from dialogues to sets and even downright spoofs, or if you're the incurable romantic, then yes, this film will be right up your alley." 
" a thoroughly enjoyable film....10/10","i hate luv storys is an amazing film in its own right...it is a special film not because its something new or untold of..but because of its treatment of the age old clichés.. to start with..imran khan hasn't looked this good in a film since a longgg time...sonam kapoor as always is a beholder's delight...and the rest of the crew looks good too....the new director impresses..so does the music by vishal-shekhar...this is a quintessential love story which would make you nostalgic and at the end of it you would wish if only there was more... a nice simple romantic film...which is thoroughly enjoyable..its pleasant to watch amidst all the humdrum....for me this film roxxx...a simple movie like this now n then doesn't hurt...in fact i love to burn the midnight oil for films like these.. a perfect 10/10" 
" A bad execution of repetitive story.","'I hate luv story' seems like to make an attempt to make a cool film but it fails certainly. It has the same old story with no exceptions. A boring story can sometimes be compensated by good performances but it is not the case with IHLS. I was waiting for the film but it disappointed me. Some scenes specially seems like to be shot in a hurry. Scenes where Imran proposes Sonal were executed badly. Dialogue delivery was below average. Direction was average. I think Imran took it more casually as he can do better for sure. Sonal's acting was OK. With all these negative points, there were a few good comic dialogs and some good songs. That is it. Overall an average flick. I can say I hate I hate love stories." 
" I hated this story.... the cast, the production, everything!!!","I was obliged to see this movie by my class-mates who kept importuning me for not accompanying them for the films. I normally try to evade them as their main interest is the masala Hindi flicks, devoid of credible acting, teemed with amateurish clichés and ostentatious drama and completed with a happy ending. This film highlights the tumultuous love 'saga' (as they mentioned) of Simran and Jay. Their relationship is equated into Jay's and then Simran's rejection with the other. By the time love pervades, the movie becomes drab and over-long. The main concern of this train-wreck is the impertinent appendages made by the script-writer to generate laughter, which includes the character of the director to go bananas whenever he converses with Jay and only because he is a director and has to emote. Bottom-line -He ain't that funny!Another irrelevant inclusion is the screen-time provided to Aamir Ali, who can decimate robots, a cryonically frozen primeval being, a senile turtle and a meditating ascetic in terms of facial contortions and expressions. In the first interaction with Jay, he comes across as an egotistical and cocky actor who personifies self-importance. He is constantly lulling after chicks and asks Jay whether there were any hot ones on the set. In the next shot, he is play-acting a scene where he is supposed to be comforting his lover, who's evidently on the death-bed. His countenance is so inexpressive and inflexible, I wonder why such an acclaimed director ( as the director in the movie proclaims) would cast such a weak lead. At least the lady who plays the actress seems more actressy. Then, towards the end, he talks to Imran about his butt and to wear tight jeans to attract ladies. I could palpably see why the director wanted to include that scene. Dostana made people laugh (I was bored though) and gay references are a fad now. So, in the end when Jay cheekily tells him that he has a great butt in front of girls, he feels abashed and the girls distance themselves from him. But the scenes are so desperately seeking better comic-timing and cheesy giggles that it all falls flat. Please, promote anyone but Aamir Ali, because he seems to be the posterity of the Grand Old Oak trees. Another bad apple was Sameer Soni as the whimsical director who made one commercial hit after another. He seems to be raising colonies of red forest ants in his pants as he keeps shouting at all times. But in the end, he somehow manages to influence Imran Khan (everyone who seems bad acts good towards the end to raise the actor's spirit and make him fall in love). But I think I have seen such characters before.A sour mango was Sonam, who in the process of looking beautiful, has exfoliated all the layers of acting and emotions. Now, she seems to be a mordant beauty-queen who simple has to faces- a happy one and a bitter one. She is supposed to be addicted to love stories and feels that she is living in a dreamily lovable world where everything is right but realizes that its not and falls for the right wrong guy in the end. But, like most other actresses in modern Bollywood, she seems to have foregone the depth that she could have added to her performance. She looks tangy in one scene, then sweet in the other, then tangy, then again sweet and so on. Its like watching a cycle ride a uniformly bumpy path where the bumps are equally distanced from one another.Imran too hasn't proved much in the film except that he is now completely a commercial actor (i.e, one that inexorably has to look buffed and beefy, sprouting a body-builder physique and having shallow acting skills or at least pretending to have one). He horribly emoted in the sad scenes, not even trying hard to show his love. HE tells Sonam "I don't know how but I have fallen in love with you" or something like that but in the end is left heart-broken. Well, even Rosie O'Donnell would have refused the offer because he recites those lines devoid of any realization. Another thing I noticed was the increasing emulation of Aamir Khan in the film that he tries to do, but falters miserably. He raises his eye-brows unnecessarily and talks more like the former. A few words of advice: "Do not become Harman Baweja". Then there is the protuberant friend of Jay who plays the same way he does in the countless commercials that he appears in. Another caricature becomes does he alas....Another thing that bugged me infinitely was the abnormally high usage of voice-over used childishly in the movie. Have nothing to take the story forward - use voice-overs. I advice the director to watch "Adaptation" where the voice-over has been adeptly incorporated.The songs seemed uninspired and flaccid, the screenplay riddled with idiosyncrasies and the acting gives a looming feeling of boredom. Jaane Tu was implausible and a bit stupid, but had a few watchable moments but this has none. A commercial clap-trap like this deserves a 2 out of 10." 
" I Hate Luv Storys Review","First things first. Imran Khan and Sonam Kapoor make an interesting pair. After the Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif coupling, this seems to be the most refreshing jodi that's jaunting and jiving on screen. Nice chemistry. Nice tu-tu-main-main (sparring). Nice physical compatibility. And a well-balanced emotional quotient. Kudos to the two of them to carry forth a film which once again doesn't really have anything to boast about in the 'storys' department.
Thematically, I Hate Luv Storys, is extremely simplistic, uni-layered and terribly predictable. Imran and Sonam do begin on the we-hate-each-other note, with Imran squirming at any and everything that's filmy while Sonam swears by it all: pink teddys, bunches of blooms, candle-light dinners, Karan Johar films, cuddly Cupid's bows, shooting stars, soppy dialogues and all that made-for-each-other mush. But we all know the way the wind blows, from the word go. Mush shall rule, and how! For all the digs that producer Karan Johar allows on himself (filmmaker Samir Soni is actually a spoof on KJo), we know the film's going to end up reiterating KJo -- and all he translates into onscreen -- as king.So, Jay Dhingra, who likes girls, but hates girly stuff, is gonna end up crying like a girl very soon. Of course, first he must ridicule Simran for all her 'stoopid' misconceptions about lurrrv, including her boyfriend Raj who besides being a frumpish bore, wears 'fugly' shirts too. But it doesn't take long for the tables to be turned, twice over. On the one hand, Simran discovers her penchant for Mr Wrong (quirky, irreverent Imran), rather than Mr Right (politically correct Samir). And on the other hand, sceptic Imran succumbs to the love bug, red roses, rain-drenched songs, airport encounters, et all. Only, their turn-overs are mistimed. So that, when Simran says 'haan', jokey Jay says 'nah!' and when Jay wanna say 'yes, yes, yes!', it's a punctilious let's-be-just-friends from the sobered Simran.Kya khali-peeli confusion, all this babalog blah. But hey, blah can be timepass too. Specially when it has loads of icing on it. Debutant director Punit Malhotra layers his first film with oodles of sugar coating: great locales, mast music (Vishal-Shekhar), a yummy 'n yuppy lead pair, some laugh-out-loud moments and a lot of laugh-on-ourself sequences that ridicule the romcoms that roll out of the Bollywood factory (there are jibes on almost all of Karan Johar films), only to finally reiterate them as pills the public wants. On the performance front, watch out for Imran's endless emoticons (eyebrow lifts, smirks, smileys) and his pronounced pout. And for Sonam's svelte form and pleasant screen presence.
Candy floss floats. Popcorn rules. Go, chew on it.
A word about:
Performances: Cool. Nothing to boast about, but quite watchable, both Sonam and Imran. Together, they share a lively chemistry that keeps the fun rolling. Samir Soni's spoof on Karan Johar-Sanjay Leela Bhansali is cute. Samir Dattani is suitably stiff. He's supposed to be a bore, no.
Story: Punit Malhotra's story is ekdum simple and predictable. But then, when was romance supposed to be rocket science!
Dialogues: Very ordinary. Sometimes corny.
Cinematography: Ayananka Bose creates a visually pretty film.
Music: Vishal-Shekhar create a peppy score that goes well with the pop tenor of the film. Watch out for the title track, Bin Tere and Bahara.
Styling: Manish Malhotra's costumes are the high point: uber cool and urban chic. Lot's of 'fugly' shirts juxtaposed against fundoo Tees, with crazy graffiti.
Inspiration: All of Karan Johar films!" 
" A fun film!","I Hate Luv Storys is a humorous modern love story with all the flare and drama of a Bollywood classic. Jay and Simran have great chemistry and the development of their relationship captivates the audience. Although the premise of the movie is grander than grand, the two meet on the set of a Bollywood film and fall in and out of love with each other time and time again, the audience can relate to the ups and downs of their courtship. The songs are great to sing along to and the internal monologues of Jay and Simran give the characters more depth than is sometimes afforded in Bollywood.
This film builds off of the Bollywood classic themes seen in films like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak of a young couple willing to do whatever it takes to be together. However, unlike these films, the protagonists don't instantaneously fall in love and are often falling in and out of love with each other. The portrayal of love in I Hate Luv Storys is more natural and realistic than that seen in classic films. Additionally, the character of Veer, the director, has a style similar to KJo. Part of what makes this film to endearing is the Bollywoodiness of it all- the big dance numbers, the sets, the music, the drama. Since KJo is a producer of this film, we see his trademark over the top Bollywood style that film scholar Sangita Gopal says is more of the same, but brought to the extreme. This film is so fun because it is over the top!" 
" sthu","This is a nice movie stop trying to judge someones acting, good effort by sonam kapoor and imran khan.love you guys ......dogs always bark.ignore them" 
" good time pass movie...","Its a good time pass movie.. First half is full of comedy but second half starts with Indian Drama... Kavin Dave has acted very well... Sonam Kapoor is OK but in some scenes she looks pretty. There is a lot of comedy in the movie and it is worth watching.I am giving 8/10 because this movie made me laugh....Don't go after the name... its an Indian movie so it was sure that it would have a happy ending where hero and heroine will fall in love..."No One Hates Luv Storys"... They may be jealous :PHere is a review from Rediff: it's Imran and Sonam's collective persona and their free-flowing chemistry that makes all the difference. Although the pair deserve better than an amateurishly written romance to scoop out their terrific potential as a combination. I Hate Luv Storys is, at best, a promising even if imperfect indication of things to come in the direction." 
" Pretty good romantic comedy for the younger generation","I understand the reason as to why there have been negative comments for this movie. However, I could also imagine that all those people who have watched this movie were not expecting much from it and hoped for the best. I first watched the trailer for this movie almost a month ago, and i could not wait for it to be released. The movie certainly didn't disappoint me at all, and i loved it.I can write a lot about how good the movie is and that, but truth is if you enjoy watching romantic comedies, this movie is for you! And if you're one of the people who enjoy the bollywood songs, there are really great songs in this movie too :)" 
" Clichéd but told beautifully","The story was clichéd and repetitive, but the only thing that made the difference was Punit's outstanding script and the execution (direction) of it. Whenever the director is also the writer, the film seems to work more, 3 idiots, LAGE RAHO MUNNA BHAI, JAB WE MET, LOVE AAJ KAL, DDLJ, or KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI. Apart from these things, the writer-director PUNIT MALHOTRA shows that he really knows bollywood, and the characterizations of both the main leads were fantastic. The dialogues were witty and sometime touching. However, the story line was fully predictable, but sometimes it doesn't matter whether how new the story is, what matters is if the film touches the right spot, and it does. The film goes right into your heart and stays there for a long time.Points.ACTING 9/10.DIALOGUE 9.5/10.SCREENPLAY 9/10.STORY 5/10.MUSIC 10/10.LYRICS 8/10.Overall, watch this film if you like films that are touching. The film will definitely make space in your heart and will stay with you even after a long time. If you have any thing planned for today, postpone it and go for this one. You will come out with a smile for sure!" 
" Are u kidding me?","I hated I hate love stories. it was one of the most pathetic romantic comedies ever with a very old storyline and way to much parody-full content and the clichés. seriously this film is not worth your precious time. the characters are not at all sketched out. neither is the director able to portray them. this was the only film which i left. even all the people were saying how horrible and slow and wannabe the film is. well it is a very bad attempt to bring cynicism on screen and the repetition of i hate love stories is annoying Karan Johar should think of better people to write his films and don't torture the audience. u might just still want to see this movie because of its cheesy trailer but seriously go at your own risk Verdict:Don't watch this" 
" I liked this movie very much....","I don't know why everybody is criticising this movie. This is all in all a typical bollywood romantic comedy. Story is very simple as all other bollywood romantic movies but this the speciality of this movie too. In it director is making a satire on romantic bollywood movies for same story line, plot etc. but in a different way. Cinematography of the movie is fantastic, music is good & catchy, some songs are really very good. Sonam Kapoor is looking very beautiful in the movie & sets are very good looking. Everybody acted well in it. You can really understand this movie if u r in relationship with someone. Even if u r not, u can enjoy it for its fun & entertaining part............."
