" Mix and Mash","Deepak Tijori was not that successful as an actor, mostly he played supporting roles and then he shifted to direction, starting with OOPS and then KHAMOSH and then FAREB(2005). Starring Manoj Bajpai with Shetty Sisters(Shilpa and Shamita) The film mixes AITRAAZ, ZEHER and many films and the final combination isn't too appealing. It starts off as a thriller becomes an Aitraaz kinda film and ends up like one. The film holds your attention in many parts, though at times things don't work out, especially as predictability starts. The movie follows the throdden part towards the climax Direction is okay, though the script lets him down Music is okay Baras Jaa being the most popular one.Manoj Bajpai however great actor maybe, is not that comfortable in commercial films especially the lovey dovey stuff, he does his role well except in some scenes though but yet a good job- 6.5/10 Shilpa Shetty underplays her part with maturity - 8/10 Shamita Shetty is also superb, sadly her career didn't work out well - 7/10 Amongst rest Parmeet Sethi is okay, Milind Gunaji too is okay(surprisingly he starred in another film with the same title in 1996) Kelly Dorji, Shawar Ali are nothing great rest are okay" 
" OK movie","FAREB is not just a love triangle, revolving around a man torn between love and lust but also a murder mystery. And the women in this story go to extremes to get the man they desire.Not that FAREB is path-breaking cinema. In fact, FAREB is too ordinary a fare as far as the script is concerned, but it's Tijori's execution that holds your interest at several points in the film.. Aditya Manoj Bajpai works as a creative director in an advertising agency. His wife Neha Shilpa Shetty, a medical practitioner, is devoted to her husband and kid.Riya Shamita Shetty was married to a corporate honcho Bakul Thakker, who happened to be a client of Aditya's ad-agency. Riya and Aditya meet at a presentation and she gets attracted to him. Riya is completely smitten by Aditya and tries to seduce him time and again. He spurns her initially, but succumbs to her charms eventually. This leads to a rift between Aditya and Neha.And then the unthinkable happens: Riya is murdered. The needle of suspicion points towards Aditya and being the prime suspect, the cops Kelly Dorji, Hemant Pande arrest him. Someone is also watching Aditya and blackmailing him for his affair with Riya. Who killed Riya?FAREB isn't an original subject. A theme like this has been witnessed with regularity in Bollywood. A dash of AITRAAZ, a bit of ZEHER and a tinge of BEZUBAAN mix them, shake them and FAREB is ready to be served.From the writing point of view, screenplay writers Brijesh Jayarajan and Girish Dhamija open the cards at the very outset. A happily-married couple, a young entrepreneur who has just lost her husband, the woman seducing the man she wants to possess, the blackmailer, the rift between husband-wife... So much is packed in the first hour. While Tijori handles the plot convincingly, the pace slows down time and again in this half. The slow pacing can still be overlooked thanks to the twists and turns in the story, which genuinely keep you involved. The intermission point, when Manoj and Shamita have an ugly confrontation, only raises the expectations from the second half.But problems seep in during the post-interval portionsThe story becomes one of those routine murder-mysteries in this half. From the motive and identity of the blackmailer to the actual culprit in the finale, the sequence of events that lead to the climax are plain mediocre. The identity of the killer does come as a surprise, but not as a jolt. That nail-biting finish is clearly lacking here!Writers Brijesh Jayarajan and Girish Dhamija could've thought of a far more imaginative and innovative way to take the story to the finale. Anu Malik's music is in sync with the film and thankfully, the songs don't pop up every fifteen minutes. Manoj Bajpai handles his role with amazing ease. Shilpa Shetty maintains the studied silence part with grace and maturity. Shamita Shetty is getting better with every film. Kelly Dorji is expressionless. Milind Gunaji and Parmeet Sethi are okay.Rating:- * *." 
" Nice mystery - worth watching once","I watched it with modest expectations and I was surprised on the positive side. Well developed story that avoids the clichéd ending. Some parts did feel a bit unpolished but the movie was still very enjoyable. Recommended for watching once; well since it is a mystery, watching it a second time is not going to be interesting - especially because execution is not very smooth." 
" they have cheated on us......don't waste any minute of thinking about the movie.","Do not waste your time. one of the worst screenplay I have ever seen. story is good though. Everything except the story is bad in my opinion. Manoj sir is disappointing.Deepak Tijori and Bijesh Jayarajan surely know how to f*ck with a very nice story.They tried to show some hotness but they failed miserably. I think I have helped you as much as i could. IMDb is saying I have to write at least 10 lines. the movie starts with a murder then it proceeds in a love triangle by now the director have forgotten about the murder. the movie is a Fareb to the audience." 
" Slow-paced but good performances","This movie is a bit of a disappointment as the trailers are slightly misleading in terms of the story. Although the story is kind of interesting, it is rather slow-paced. Manoj Bajpai just seems average. Post-Phir Milenge Shilpa Shetty has been giving one good, mature performance after another. Above all is Shamita Shetty who definitely is the show stealer. Her power-packed scenes are awesome and she performs and delivers her dialogues straight from the heart full of passion, rage, or sensuality. The Manoj-Shamita confrontation scene is quite interesting and the revealing of the mystery person is quite shocking and adds a whole another dimension to the story, which had become quite a drag towards the end." 
" An interesting movie!","'Fareb' is an interesting movie about three lead characters Manoj, Shilpa & Shamita. Directed by Deepak Tijori, actor-turned-director.The film opens interestingly as a corporate honcho, Amit Singhania (Bakul Thakker) gets murdered in his house. The police come and investigate the murder and his wife, Ria Singhania (Shamita Shetty) is the prime suspect.However, Ria manipulates the court and gets freed from the murder case.Then the focus of the movie shifts to Aditya Malhotra (Manoj Bajpai) who is an adman and works diligently for his company.He has a beautiful and caring wife, Neha (Shilpa Shetty) who is a doctor and also has a 6 year old kid.Aditya's life turns upside down when Ria enters his company to make advertising contracts and gets attracted to him.She tries to woo Aditya by calling him frequently at her house.However, he is not interested in her as he is a family man. But somehow Ria's charms tempt him and he gives in to his desire.This leads to an argument between Aditya and Neha.And then the unimaginable happens: Ria gets murdered. Aditya is the prime suspect in her murder as he was having an affair with Ria. Meanwhile, Aditya is being watched and blackmailed for his fling with Ria. The cops arrest him and he is tried in court.Will Aditya succeed in proving himself innocent and find the real murderer? 'Fareb' is an extremely well-made film. The screenplay is good and so is the story-telling. Deepak Tijori did a great job in holding the viewer's interest till the very last frame.Music is hummable. 'Barasja Ae Badal Barasja' and 'Subha Bhi Bekarar Hai' being the best tracks in the movie. Sure to be loved by everyone! Cinematography is excellent and editing is a bit slow, especially in the second half.Watch 'Fareb' if you haven't done yet. You wouldn't be disappointed!"
