" A good romantic film.","Jigariyaa is a good romantic film. Bollywood has seen a lot of romantic films with a lot in common. Jigariyaa follows in the footstep of some of the romantic films. The hero Shyamu(Harshvardhan Deo)falls in love with Radhika(Sneha Deori)in first sight. They fall in love but parents do not agree and they separate them but they meet again.I liked the acting of Sneha Deori. While other actors are also very good. The film involves some poetry which I like. The way Shyamu tries to impress Radhika is also good. There is not much action in the movie. You are eager to know what will happen at the end. The ending is a bit unexpected for me and unique. For a low budget film the film is very good and a bit unique. If you like romance genre then you should watch it." 
" After long time watched a movie which defines Love........","Love can't be defined or understood..... Background music is also so touching....good movie to watch...."
