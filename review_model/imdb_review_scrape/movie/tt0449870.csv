" Good emotional connection","Movie was flowing very nicely, sympathy for the actress. Displayed psychological reasonings very well. The ending was just poorly executed." 
" great thriller","At first, this movie seems more of like any other Indian made movie in the thriller/drama genre. The chemistry between Bipasha Basu and Dino Morea, however, really elevate the movie's appeal. Bipasha's psychological state and what she has to go through are quite emotional. Her acting, in my opinion, is quite superb through the whole movie and in the final sequence. Although Bipasha's constant need for attention was annoying at times, I could see why it was necessary for the movie's plot of separated lovers. Dino Morea kept his emotional inside but when he was desperately in need of Bipasha he showed it. The dance sequences seem out of place and unnecessarily tacked on. I just forwarded these parts and they did not really alter any part of the movie. I do not want to give away the ending so just be prepared for a great movie with a weird twist!"
