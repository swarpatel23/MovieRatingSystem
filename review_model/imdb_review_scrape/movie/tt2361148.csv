" Everyone's Got Problems. ♦ 70%","No wonder why the film's not a hit among cinema-goers. It doesn't have cheap item songs, flesh show or silly romance or even ridiculous dialog delivery. A critic's love, Club 60 is a very fine drama about life, old age & the search for happiness.It is a real treat to watch yesteryear actors to come back, and play so genuinely, especially Farooque Sheikh. The whole cast is splendid, but I felt Raghuvir Yadav crossed the line with his antics. The plot is very calm focusing on the lives of 60 something people who meet each other at a club. Raghuvir Yadab brings them together & helps them find happiness in small things of life. Never have I seen in months in Bollywood such beautiful, deep dialogs about the mystery of life and never have I watched characters mourning death so authentically. Sarika is still so svelte!With calm music and minuscule obscene dialogs here & there, Club 60 can only be lauded using superlatives. The editing & direction could've been better, cinematography is fine.BOTTOM LINE: This is for everyone, teenagers to adults for it focuses on few values & virtues & explains it in a beautiful manner. Recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: No | Vulgarity: Mediocre | Violence/Gore/Sex/Porn: No | Smoking/Alcohol: Strong | Drugs: No" 
" Even if you are not 60, still the number will be there one day, so do not miss this must watch film having many enlightening lessons about life and its final years.","To begin with, certain films are not meant to be reviewed with the usual set pattern since they have not been made with that routine mindset and have something precious to share in their thoughtful narrative about we the people, our relationships and the life lived in our final years (of old age) under some tough conditions. Hence where you might find many reputed reviewers giving it a very average star ratings, I would strongly like to differ and rate CLUB 60 as a must watch since it does have a lot to teach about life, its profound contradictions and has a positive attitude which needs to be followed in our last phase of life i.e. old age.Opening with a soulful narration by Farooque Sheikh about his own tragedy of life faced along with wife Sarika, the film clearly indicates that there is surely something extremely thoughtful and out of the routine coming in its next reels supported by a talented cast. Admittedly it does take a little time to sink in and even the introduction of Raghuvir Yadav at first feels like a bit over the top and loud. But once it all settles down after the initial introductions and a highly emotional scene comes in led by an amazing portrayal by Sarika, CLUB 60 starts influencing the viewer strongly and then seldom gives you a dull moment right till its well-conceived realistic climax following an impressive progression. Further the film has many insightful, well written sequences to be cherished with tears and smiles together, wherein many renowned veterans make a very impactful comeback after a long hiatus.For instance, post a decent performance in "ListenAmaya" (2013), CLUB 60 gives you back the Farooque Sheikh of the 80s (as in "Katha", "Chashme Buddoor" & more) effortlessly playing the skillful surgeon who has given up the spirit of living life after the death of his young son. It makes you meet the good old Raghuvir Yadavtransporting you back in the times of his great TV serials like "Mungeri Lal Ke Haseen Sapney". The film pleasantly discovers a very fine actress in Sarika, who was more known for her bold choices of roles only back in the 80s. And the lady truly scores the maximum, playing the strong, caring and suffering characters of a mother and wife together in a splendid way. Along with these key names, CLUB 60 has Satish Shah, Tinnu Anand, Sharat Saxena & Vineet Kumar lovingly playing the group of old friends, plus Zareena Wahab, Suhasini Mulay, Himani Shivpuri, Harsh Chhaya and Viju Khote quietly leaving an impression in their short roles.Directed by the debutant Sanjay Tripathy, the film grows on you as it progresses and delivers some extremely thoughtful 'Precious Gems like dialogues', forcing you to think over them with empathy. Yes it could have easily been more impactful with a shorter length and less songs, but actually one doesn't notices these drawbacks after getting engrossed in the lives of its various characters and enjoys the songs too especially the well written ghazal "Rooh Mein Faasle Nahin Hotey", "Pal Pal Khelti Hai Zindagi" and "Kho Kar Maine Aaj Tumhe Paaya Hai" sung soulfully. Moreover with a fairly enjoyable script giving a highly refreshing, rare and meaningful message to the audience, CLUB 60 certainly rises much above these minor hiccups and deserves to be seen even by the youngsters who are eventually going to reach that age too in the coming decades. The film made me smile, laugh & cry in its various sequences depicting the last phase of our life differently and then forced me think about the same from a new perspective, as shared below in some straight words. Despite its visible shortcomings, as I see it, CLUB 60 can easily be called a revolutionary kind of project, since it simply breaks all those rotten patterns of showing 'the old age' in a depressing mode in our films since decades. In fact it brings forward an extremely important message to be passed on to every old and middle aged person around, that LIFE doesn't end when you retire after the age of 60, but it actually begins with more spirit, freedom & fun if re-considered from a new cheerful angle full of positivity.Hence with a hope that this message reaches all adults passing through any phase of their lives be it youth, middle age or old, I strongly recommend CLUB 60 to all like-minded friends here boldly, since we don't get to see such honest and sincere attempts made in our Hindi Cinema often. Yes, the film is not perfect but still is a far better product and much above than even a hundred visionless big budget films supported by all the renowned stars. Hence do give it a chance at the earliest and then spend some time thinking upon its positive message too, in order to experience an encouraging, joyful and winning end of a journey well lived." 
" Heart warming film with stars from yesteryear's - Refreshing!","I don't write reviews very often but felt compelled to because I enjoyed this film so much. Club 60 is a coming of age story of five seniors with a very nice message. It features Farooq Shaikh (who continues to demonstrate a golden touch in his choice of films), Raghubir Yadav, Satish Shah, Tinnu Anand and Sarika among others. All characters are lovable, but Raghuvir Yadav steals the show. He deserves an award for this heart warming performance. The films heart lies in its comic timing and narration of heart touching human connections. Stellar performances from Raghubir Yadav, Sarika and Farooq Sheikh. A genuine effort with events based on true-life characters that will make you laugh and cry. Don't miss this gem." 
" Definitely a 'Must Watch'.","A very nice movie. Movies are basically a medium of entertainment. Everything apart from entertainment is secondary. However the way entertainment is blended with any message or a thought makes the movie good or average. Manubhai is the centre of this movie. He represents an ideal way of living life. He epitomizes life in itself. He is naughty, he is sleazy, he is friendly, he is respectful, he is understanding, he is caring, he is rude, he is funny. All the other characters, who represent majority of the people around us, including oneself, revolve around him in just the same way as we try to follow our own life. We try to please it sometimes, we curse it sometimes. We hate it one time and then we just adore it the next time. Never do we realize what it really wants or how do we react to it. The Movie through the character of Manubhai exactly tries to give us some clues about handling that dilemma in our own life. 'Zindagi se ehsaan mat le, Zindagi pe ehsaan kar'. This basic thought is so simply put yet in such a beautiful and most importantly in such an entertaining way. The story identifies a few characters as the most important, as it should be, but the director makes sure every element of the movie is necessary. Hence, everyone shines through. Personally, of many good movies in the last 2-3 decades, I found this movie to be the closest to Hrishikesh Mukherjee style of movie making. Why the movie did not collect much money on the box office is something I don't understand, but then the movies that make money are the most stupidest kind ones. So in that sense it is right, but the producer should get back his money with some profit otherwise we wont be able to see these type of classics. The type of reality shows, happening on the idiot box, that are getting viewer ship explains the deteriorating choice of the general public and this movie is just a 'drop in the ocean' in cleansing the overall muddy entertainment spread everywhere. I did miss the movie when it got released and neither did I notice it anytime in any DVD store. I got to know about it and also watched the movie on a Free but legally available online streaming service. If anyone wants to watch after reading the review, please make sure you do the same. That is all we as responsible audience can do to support such creative activities." 
" A Must Watch at ONE GO","These kind of movies that are rarely made. A film where the audience does not get disconnected for a moment. The actors were effortless, as if, it was their own story and someone had just shot it. Raghuvir Yadav has always been a phenomenon. His character really irritates you at the beginning, such is the depth in acting. Sarika and Late Farouqe Sheikh are the elderly next door couple whom you might see everyday and they go unnoticed. The pain and loneliness has been portrayed with such an ease that you are left with little bit of moist eyes. The casting has been top notch and each one of the lot took out their best. The screenplay and direction is awesome. The dialog writer has penned it in a easy day today language.This is a movie for all age groups." 
" Not Just A Movie Review!!","I saw the movie Club 60 today and it was a surprisingly pleasant and enjoyable experience!! I basically went for the movie as it is the last movie in which the late Farooque Shaikh has acted and the fact there is still a show of a not –much-talked-about movie in the theater five weeks after its release!! Based on the title and star cast featuring some of the finest Indian actors, I had thought it would be a movie about grappling with the problems of old age!! But, in fact, it turned out to be a movie "For All Ages" in the real sense of the word!! The plot line of the movie is deceptively simple on paper – An elderly married couple, both doctors, Farooque Shaikh as Tariq, a neurosurgeon and Sarika as Saira (looking simply beautiful I bet she can give her own daughter Shruti Hassan a run for her money even now) shift from Pune to Mumbai after the loss of their young son in a shootout killing in America. The couple is devastated but the mother tries to get back to her life by starting to practice again and keeping herself busy but the father does not cope well with the tragedy and stops practicing, becomes withdrawn and goes into Depression. Enter Mannubhai Shah(Raghuvir Yadav in supreme form), their nosy neighbor who coaxes the doctor into joining a club where he and his sexagenarian friends hang out playing tennis, cracking stupid jokes at each other, reciting poetry and ogling at pretty girls.. Ha-ha!And thus begins a wonderful journey of adjustment, bonding, relationships, joy, grief, friendship and Life as such. The basic premise of the movie may appear simple but it is in the different well directed and expertly executed scenes depicting everyday conversations that not so simple issues are addressed. In possibly one of the best scenes of the movie, Sarika asks the psychiatrist treating her husband that should the fact that she does not experience as much grief as her husband for their son's loss make her feel guilty? Does it mean she loved her son less? In one of the best explanations ever given on celluloid, the psychiatrist replies, "In the aftermath of an earthquake, some walls of a house are destroyed whereas some are left standing. It does not mean that the walls that haven't fallen have not experienced the full force of the earthquake it's just that they have coped better" And in such simple conversations lies the beauty of the movie and dare I say, even Life!In our everyday lives, we experience a lot of ups and downs. In spite of the fact that Change is inevitable, nobody is comfortable with the idea of change. We wallow in our sorrows and setbacks, and feel sad and frustrated and helpless!! We think "Oh God! Why are we so unlucky?"But, if we see the larger picture, every person, every family around us has their share of sorrows and tragedies – and invariably by introspection, our tribulations then seem insignificant. I know it is easier said than done, but if we start taking ourselves a little less seriously, and try to just live life as it comes, the world might not seem as bad as it appears to be. I am not saying that that situations will become rosy overnight or that our problems will suddenly present themselves with a solution, but lightening up a bit might just make us emotionally more capable of dealing with them, even if they worsen. The movie explores these lines of thought and more, in a not-so-serious manner, but never mockingly. I missed my Mom a lot while watching the movie as I think she would also have enjoyed the movie. It is rare enough nowadays for two complete strangers sitting side by side to even glance at each other in a city like Mumbai. But today, the audience was enjoying the movie together wholeheartedly. And me and an elderly lady (most probably my mother's age) sitting next to me acknowledged each other as we laughed together at some of the jokes cracked on screen!! I don't remember, apart from 3 idiots, to have experienced such a thing in a theater before. Kudos to the director Sanjay Tripathy and team for making such an enjoyable movie. Credit is due to them as the movie never sounds sermoning or goes around giving life lessons, but just depicts Life as it is. Although I doubt this movie will last for another week (there is only one show in a single Multiplex in Mumbai right now), but I would advise you to watch this movie, in which the characters are common people like you and me instead of the some of the crappy mindless movies being shown as a sorry excuse for the power of the common man. If not, catch this movie on DVD if you can... it is a must watch with your entire family. Raghuvir Yadav's spectacular performance and his awesome T-Shirt quotes are reason enough. It Is So Simple To Be Happy But So Difficult To Be Simple." 
" Brilliant movie straight from the heart.....","Club 60 will always be remembered for its simplistic approach of story telling. Amongst the many good thing about this movie is its perfect casting. Even for the smallest roles, good actors have been roped in. Harsh Chhaya is top class in his very brief role OF Doctor and so is Mona Wasu. Suhasini Mulay, Zarina Wahab,Himani Shivpuri, Viju Khotey plays their part perfectly. Vineet Kumar, Satish Shah, Sharat Saxena and Tinnu Anand, they all part of Manu bhai gang look so refreshing and naughty that you simply love them. But as a gang leader Raghubir Yadav is brilliant. His spontaneity and full of energy approach is awesome. Farooq Shaikh carry this film on his shoulder. He is unbelievably perfect. He has essayed his difficult role so smoothly that sometimes you forget that he is acting or living his role. And ...and ...and the real surprise is Sarika. What a gifted actress she is. here she comes as real winner. she has played her part with such a precision one simply cant believe..... Another best part of this film is its dialogue. Beautifully written lines grows on you. screenplay is smooth. wish length was shorter by 15 mnts, though it never bothers you. Producer Kavee Kumar and Vineet Yadav must be applauded for his brave effort. Sanjay Tripathy's direction matches the simplicity of the subject. Cinematography by Shyamanand Jha is top class. Music is silk smooth. I recommend this movie to the people of every age because this kind of movies are not made often." 
" Beautiful Movie!!","This is a beautiful movie and I agree such movies are rarely made. This is a film where the audience connects with the script throughout and celebrates it in all possible ways. The Late Farooque Shaikh, Sarika, Raghuvir Tadav, Vineet Kumar, Satish Shah, Tinnu Anand are just brilliant, as if, it was really their own story. The casting has been top notch and each one of the lot took out their best. Although, I would say Sharat Saxena has not done complete justice playing G.S. Dhillon. Else, the movie is just awesome. I loved "Beer Baba" in the movie. Me and my wife have seen this movie multiple times and it still seems new to us every time we watch it.This movie is surely for ages and I wish Bollywood should care to make such movies in the future as well." 
" Slow but a Realistic Drama.....",""Club 60" deals with the stories of aged pals who become part of the club named Club 60, where they share their joys and sorrows they have gone through their lives. The film centers around Farooq Shiekh who has immersed himself into depression after the loss of his only son. He relives his life once he becomes part of the Club 60 and realizes he is not the only one who has had a loss in life. The way the film narrates the loss almost every character have undergone by their 60s makes this film true to life. On the whole the film is pretty slow but through its occasional wit the film succeeds to fully bring its theme and encourages the old people to live their life to the fullest. Though the pace of the film I've mentioned before is slow, there are also surprises with which each character's past agony is shown. Besides, the performances from the lead are also to be watched out for. Especially, Raghuvir Yadav's role besides Farooq Shiekh and Sarika's performances are what you would remember the film for. For the theme, the film is quite remarkable, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a good film.Rating: 3 stars out of 4" 
" A nice film","Club 60 is a film meant for the elder audiences, The film tells the story of elderly people who have a club together. The film starts with a tragedy story of Farooque Sheikh and Sarika who lose their only son, slowly they meet other aged people after he joins the club. The film has sort of a skeletal plot where there are multiple stories. The emotions are well handled though at times the comedy does get crude, some scenes do seem to try too hard to make you laugh, especially Raghuvir Yadav's scenes. The film does get a bit too emotional at times tooDirection by Sanjay Tripathi is good Music is okay but too many songs do spoil the paceFarooque Sheikh(his last film when alive) does a brilliant job, playing his part like a pro as always, Sarika too is good Sharat Saxena is superb, Raghuvir Yadav tends to annoy but that is more due to his role, Tinnu Anand is good, Satish Shah seen after a hiatus does a great job, others are all good" 
" Club 60 will inspire elderly people to live more fulfilling lives! A must watch!","Many may not have heard of a Hindi film called Club 60, but it is an entertaining & thoughtful film that teaches you an important "lifestyle skill" – Life a fulfilling life even if you are on the wrong side of 60.But for this you've to come out of your "lifestyle well" in which you've been living like a "frog" for years and decades. Sounds familiar, isn't? I am sure you will agree that most of us live like this "frog" in the "well" of our own miseries, despair, routine habits, and limited recreational activities.This is precisely the kind of life that neurosurgeon, Dr Tariq Sheikh (Farooq Sheikh) and his wife Dr Saira (Sarika) were living after the death of their only son. Things started changing when they came in contact with a funny, colourful and melodramatic character, Manubhai (Raghubir Yadav).It is he who introduced them to Club 60 consisting of retired – but jovial – members (Satish Shah, Tinnu Anand, Sharat Saxena & Vineet Kumar).HAPPY POINTS about CLUB 60 1 - Club 60 is a simple film - but one which acts as a Mirror to anyone over 60 or someone living a boring/depressive life. It is not only entertaining (it has nice comedy in it) but also gives you an important lesson in life that will touch your mind and heart.The film is emotional, thought-provoking and will surely make you rethink about your own (routine) life. It will make you wonder if at all there is any enjoyments and fulfilment in your own life.By the way, I saw this film on Star Gold Select. And it is the only TV channel in which you are most likely to see the film again in future.2 – It has dialogues which are very touching, thoughtful and also real. It is as if it's YOU who is being talked to. It is as if it's YOUR life which is getting "exposed".The MOST touching dialogue was the one between Sarika and Farooq Sheikh (who has sadly passed away) in the balcony of their flat. The way Sarika emotionally implored Farooq to get out of the rut he is into escape from the depression he is in, will bring tears to your eyes. It may even make you feel "self-conscious" depending on the situation in your life.Manubhai will teach you - "Zindagi se ehsaan mat le, Zindagi pe ehsaan kar". This from Manubhai who himself had a very, very sad past.Tell you what, it is only in rare Indian films that you will get to see such "real" dialogues – and without any melodrama surrounding it.3 – There are many hilarious moments presented in a normal manner – without any melodrama.The best one for me is when semi-naked Sharat Saxena calls Raghubir Yadav (the most hyperactive all characters) from a hotel and tells him what a prostitute did to him after he slept with her. After listening, Raghubir burst into a kind of intense "suppressed laughter"it looks so real and infectious that you too will react in exactly the same way!4 – It was refreshing to see Sarika after so many years. In fact, I'd never seen her in a film after she became aged. Long, long time back (when in school) I'd seen a film in which she was just – believe it or not! - a Kid. Just see how time passes by.And how can I forget Farooq Sheikh, the great actor he is? Sadly he passed away in the same month in which the film was released (Dec. 2013). We will all remember him by his Tumhari Amrita, Katha, Garam Hawa, Chashme Buddoor – and Club 60 too.5 – You will get to hear melodious Ghazals - "Rooh Mein Faasle Nahin Hotey", "Pal Pal Khelti Hai Zindagi" and "Kho Kar Maine Aaj Tumhe Paaya Hai".SAD POINTS about CLUB 60 1 - Raghubir Yadav's character is occasionally melodramatic and over-the-top which could easily have been avoided.2 – After the "MOST touching dialogue" I'd just mentionedand when you are in tears while listening to itsuddenly the scene changes to bursts of laughter amongst the members of Club 60.This is a horrible anti-climax, I must say! It is as if the emotional build-up created by that heart-rending dialogue was suddenly "killed"!Finally, such "thoughtful, eye-opening" entertaining films should be made more often. Although Club 60 is by no means a great film, but it is a film I'd love to watch MORE THAN ONCE." 
" Excellent Performances Lead This Affecting Drama!","'Club 60' is an honest & affecting drama, about grief & the battles life puts us all in. Sanjay Tripathy directs this underrated film earnestly & gets a top-notch cast, who deliver strongly.'Club 60' Synopsis: After the untimely death of their only son Iqbal, Neurosurgeon, Dr Tariq Sheikh (Farooq Sheikh) and his wife Dr Saira (Sarika) are unable to put the pieces of their broken life together. Tariq suffers from depression, while Saira struggles to cope with her husband's suicidal tendencies. In an attempt to make a fresh start in life and to get rid of the nothingness' that haunts them, they shift to Mumbai from Pune. More than the city's distractions, it's their loud neighbor Manubhai (Raghubir Yadav), who manages to kill the deafening silence that plagues them with his somewhat annoying yet adorable antics. Manubhai introduces Tariq to the jovial members of Club 60 - where live begins at 60.'Club 60' mirrors life with honesty. Its a sad story, yet it never forgets to be uplifting by the time the film ends. Its an affecting story about people dealing with the circumstances of life & how sometimes grief can never leave you alone. This isn't a perfect film by any shot, but it at least it tells its story with heart & soul. The Screenplay is Written with heart, although its sluggish in parts. Sanjay Tripathy's Direction is commendable. Performance-Wise: The joy of watching The Late/Great Farooq Sheikh is immeasurable. The legendary actor delivers a fabulous performance from start to end, without missing a single beat. Sarika supports Sheikh wonderfully. Raghubir Yadav is bit too loud, but that's the demand of his character. Sharat Saxena, Satish Shah & Tinnu Anand are fantastic, as always. Vineet Kumar is decent. Suhasini Mulay is in fine form, as usual. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Club 60' deserves a watch. Its an honest film with first-rate performances."
