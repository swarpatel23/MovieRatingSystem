" Audio visual representation of A rated sms jokes","Director Mr. Indra Kumar work is fine. He made the silent scenes more hilarious than the scenes with punch lines. He has justified this adult comedy genre in good way. A scene, when Aftab comes out from bull is hilarious, even it is a silent one. Big drawback of this movie is it's scrap story. Screenplay is also simple. Dialogues by Milap Zaveri, are the highlight of film. It is very clear that first they had selected the A rated jokes from all other sources then thought how to stuff them. So, outcome is no story and linear screenplay. Most of the jokes are already heard. After all, they will make you smile at least. I appreciate the makers honesty that they had already given clear cut indication about the content of film in trailer and promos. Performance wise Ritesh Deshmukh is brilliant. He does his scenes with lots of ease and makes the even dull scenes interesting. His dialogues delivery is also very good. Vivek Obrai and Aftab Shivdasani are OK. I am unable to distinguish between all female actors but they are so so. Music wise title track composed by Sanjeev Darshan is good and another "Mamla set kar le.." composed by Anand Raj Anand is good." 
" A Collection Of Popular Adult Jokes & Cult Comedy Movie References ♦ 33%","Masti had some substance in it when it released almost a decade ago, but its sequel gasps for a fresh story and only delivers adult humor with no furnishing at all.The characters seem like they jumped out of American Reunion (2012). The whole plot is somewhat derived from it. The characters follow their usual air and continue to do for what they had previously learned a lesson (in Masti c. 2004). Women in here, not to mention, are treated as objects and don't induce humor. But, the massively vulgar jokes on them, do. Popular SMS jokes, obscene one-liners & merchandise which give out a witty remark is what Grand Masti is all about. In order to put the film in line with the title, the makers have used the word "grand" a couple of times and the use of fireworks, waves & screw-driven into its cavity mostly depict the same.Cast performance is fine, and all three lead actors portray slightly exaggerated beings of their older selves. Actresses are pure flesh show, be it wives or paramours.Certain sequences are borrowed from Austin Powers, Agneepath, No Entry & they give it a worn-out look and totally drive the audience off the screen. An average 3.3 out of 10 for the effervescent sequel. I also do suspect if it crossed the line.BOTTOM LINE: Much like expected, Grand Masti delivers vulgarity, but at the price of poor plot & clichéd conclusion. Perfect for a mild laugh with like-minded friends to bust stress.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity: Very Mild | Nudity/Vulgarity: Strong | Sex: Implications only | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: No | Violence: Mediocre | Gore: No | Smoking/Drugs: No | Alcohol: Strong" 
" A mixture of Adult Jokes","Never view this movie with a critic eye.Its just a journey filled with familiar adult jokes,Vulgar implies and its just a main stream Bgrade Movie! How you'll accept this one depend upon your potential.If you are a great fan of Adult comedy film you may be disappoint with familiar jokes.However the presence of known actors make the movie a good one. Theme: Three married guys — Meet (Vivek Oberoi ), Prem (Aftab Shivdasani ) and Amar (Ritesh Deshmukh ) decide to attend their college reunion at Shree Lalchand University of Technology and Science (SLUTS), only to be trapped in a dangerous situation apparently.Note: If you have some time free or want a laugh go for it.A pure adult comedy.Can i watch with family:NO" 
" Forget the nonsense,just have fun","Grand masti is an adult comedy which involves life of three married guys who want to have masti without letting know their wives..It is a reality take on how young guys do fun during their college time.We all have gone through that period of what we used to do during college days and young guys sometimes have fun cracking non veg or vulgar jokes.That is what grand masti offers on the siver screen..It has all the ingredients of an adult comedy..And please while watching it do neglect some cheap jokes which show women in poor light..Hardly there will be two or three..Rest all is fineAll in all Grand masti is a good movie for weekend fun." 
" Laziest, stupidest, worst script and acting ever.","I would have given -10 out of 10, but unfortunately IMDb doesn't allow that. I had the expectations of it being a hugely awesome party themed funny movie, like most Hollywood movies of that genre are, seeing as the cast was strong - all the original dudes from Masti the original movie. But no, it terribly failed my expectations.Here's the thing, the movie is a collection of vulgar double meaning jokes with sexual innuendos in very,very bad taste. You know it - all those messages that you probably might have gotten from your friend on WhatsApp, those cheap sexual jokes that keep getting forwarded around. Not that most of those messages aren't funny, but the way they're portrayed into scenes here - seems like as if a bunch of perverted noobs shot them.Sex appeal - the makers of this film probably made this movie keeping in mind the wallets of the crowd which consists of men who drop money at the name of sex. So they made a film like this, and I'm going to say it - this movie, tried to be a porn movie with only the foreplay, but no porn. The jokes sucked, the acting sucked, the script (if it in fact existed) sucked.Actually, what I feel about the script is, that some half-retarded sex depraved man wrote it. Absolutely no sensible intelligent plot, totally bad script and super clichéd dialogues, nothing original at all. Masti? NO masti at all. Masti the original movie was way way hilarious and actually had a good plot. Laughs? You'll be crying by the end as to why you even took the risk of seeing something like this. Hell, the only ONE thing that made me laugh was the fountain part in the starting. Except that, the whole movie is absolute rubbish. Now, the reason this movie is bad is because this movie was supposed to be a money maker, not a crowd puller, one which appeals to people's senses, like Bhag Milkha Bhag or Barfi. Oh my my.. This crap movie is parsecs away from them in terms of enjoyment,satisfaction, and get-your-money's- worth value.In conclusion, if you're an avid movie watcher, love movies, and love intelligent movies, or love movies with party and sex themes, you'll find this movie HUGELY disappointing. Just, please don't watch it. You'll waste 2 hours of life, and it was total torture to sit throughout the 2 hours. The only reason I sat the whole 2 hours were because my friends somehow liked this cheap lazy senseless boring outright dimwitted movie.So, my advice - forget that this movie was ever made. Just don't waste your time on it, if you're thinking of renting it on DVD or catch it on cable when it comes out in the next few months. Just, DON'T." 
" Its like watching 'Sick Catharsis of Men' sitting in a 'Gents Toilet' instead of a theater.","This Friday I got the chance to watch the first show of GRAND MASTI in a small city's multiplex out of Delhi and the venue was flooded by mainly boys from colleges and local surroundings. The house was full in just a few minutes and there were some couples and a girls group too opting for the film instead of any other released on the same day. Now the moment the film started with its very first scene explaining the new meanings of alphabets ABC, there was a deafening noise of shouts, hoots, whistles and energetic cheers in the whole theater all of a sudden. The screen was showing some cheap shots of a woman's body taken from different angles and the crowd was cheering its each new angle and dialogues just instantly.At first I thought that since its only the beginning, so may be the film is making a ground for a bold sex comedy in the next reels. But as the film progressed from its one dirty sequence to the other, I started feeling the discomfort as felt by the few couples and a girls group sitting in the row next to me. Within the next half an hour, the whole 'Grand Masti' simply turned into a 'Desperately Sasti' B-grade kind of film featuring some known names of the industry, very surprisingly. The fun got converted into vulgarity and all its so called comedy simply entered the 'over the limit' zone crossing all the possible boundaries, not yet broken in our Indian Cinema till date. So to say the least, GRAND MASTI gives you something which was never tried before in a Hindi mainstream Sex Comedy film ever and it goes way beyond your wildest cinematic imaginations to be precise.Admittedly, the experience of GM's first show, made me recall the good old decade of 80s because even after 40 minutes of the film, all those shouts, hoots and whistles were still coming constantly and the 'young boys crowd' was simply going mad, like anything. Looking at this changing state of the audience (fast turning into a scary mode), firstly the few couples sitting in the theater left the hall silently and then the only girls groups sitting beside me stood up to leave the film for the obvious reasons. Now the moment they started marching towards the exit gate, the noise of those shameless cheers even got louder and few also stood up to blow their whistles with the full force. Sitting in this strange, weird and unexplainable kind of ambiance, surpassing all my set expectations., I was frankly feeling ashamed and truly confused about the film's questionable content and its visible impact on the audience right away.For a few minutes, I had my attention completely lost and just when I again got back into the film, there came intermission written on the screen and the lights were all on. But within those bright lights, as all the laughing faces became visible and their mutual conversations started coming into my ears full of lusty comments & jokes, I really felt as if I am sitting in a 'Gents Toilet' instead of a movie theater, witnessing the 'Sick Catharsis of Men' being practiced by every single person around, quite carelessly.However the fact which amazed me a lot more was that as the film was moving from its one level of craziness on to the other, the whole crowd was equally getting mad and even noisier than before, without losing any kind of energy quite astonishingly. In fact listening to the similar cheers and shouts in the last sequence of the film too (after 2 hours), I was forced to accept that I had not seen such kind of weird yet energetic response, even in any of the biggest Star's movie in the last 2 decades ever.Next, the film got over, the crowd started moving towards the exit and it was like a whole bunch of sexually charged & dangerously provoked brats were coming out of the theater recalling all those disgusting names used in the film having double meanings. But what scared me like hell was that now the same lusty remarks, laughs and shouts were being made loudly, aiming at the other couples roaming in the shopping mall in a completely different mood, which even forced many girls to simply enter whatever showroom came their way just to avoid the boys.The scene at once reminded me of a recent seminar where many reputed names of the film industry strongly opposed the thought that "Hindi Cinema is badly influencing our present young society." The reputed panelists were simply not ready to accept this severe allegation and had their own arguments for the same which were also quite logical. But looking at this 'Loud, Wild and Fanatical' kind of audience response witnessed both within and outside the hall, I would like to say, that the issue surely needs to be addressed in the right perspective at the earliest.So this was about my experience of watching GRAND MASTI in the theater today which again reminded me of the two famous phrases used to define our part of the world as 'Sexually Starved" or "Sexually Repressed" society, very aptly. Therefore, being a film made strictly for the men, by the men and of the men, I would not like to recommend GRAND MASTI to any of the readers here, as I do respect the Identity of a Women in our society with much high regards and cannot support any such cowardly act treating them as mere objects or means of entertainment with a sick attitude.But elaborating on the same, I am also not against the genre of SEX COMEDIES as it may seem, if only they are made with a balanced vision, equally enjoyable by a man and a woman together without any gender bias." 
" Humour at it's worst.","The word CONTEXT comes to mind after watching this video( doesn't deserve the title movie), cause there was NONE.After watching this disaster, I can certainly say that graceful original comedy is extinct and it has been replaced by unpolished humorless plagiarized adult comedy. The sad part is that I could make out scenes similar to Van Wilder 3 and other foreign movies. Ritesh Deshmukh was disappointing since he is the only patron of good comedy in Indian cinema/iifa awards. It seems that he's trying to stretch out a good character he played log ago, thereby degrading it. Its demeaning and sad. As a secular atheist, I conclude that this movie doesn't appreciate women and is hell bent on objectifying and stereotyping them as bimbos.I'd reluctantly give the whole cast and crew 1 star for making the effort to make a movie and release it." 
" This film has surpassed all other adult comedies in Bollywood!!!","A film like GRAND MASTI isn't plot-driven. Not at all. And don't even expect a story here. It's more about double entendres, sexual puns and gags and the writers go bananas to woo the spectator. There's nothing left for imagination here, nor does it hinge on puerile or kiddish jokes, since the characters indulge in some really naughty play of words. The humor, let me add, may sound provocative, disgusting and offensive, but come on, what are you expecting from a film like GRAND MASTI? On the whole, GRAND MASTI crosses all limits and boundaries vis-a-vis adult humor. This one's *strictly* for those who relish naughty jokes, outrageous lines and scandalous visuals." 
" Grand Laughter!","A sequel to the 2004 hit Masti, 'Grand Masti' is truly a funny continuation of its memorable prequel. Its Grand Laughter Entertainment!'Grand Masti' Synopsis: Meet, Prem, and Amar look to have a blast at their college reunion, though they soon find themselves in another predicament.'Grand Masti' is vulgar, crass & crude from start to end. The humor laced in the narrative in all of those 130-minutes of running-time will Strictly Appeal to the Youth & Men. Women are sure to be offended, as most of the jokes & even the dialogue, are derogatory & sex-related. Being an adult-comedy, 'Grand Masti' triumphs over a laugh-out-loud first-hour & the series of events the 3 male protagonists encounter, are over-the-top, but absolutely hilarious. The second-hour dips and the jokes aren't funny enough, but the climax rides up the pace. Milap Zaveri & Tushar Hiranandani's Screenplay is no-holds-barred & offers vulgarity in abundance. A Special Mention for the crass but crackling one-liners! Indra Kumar, A Veteran in Comedies now, gets his job right. Cinematography is ordinary. Editing is fair. Music by Anand Raj Anand & Sanjeev Darshan is decent. Performance-Wise: Vivek Oberoi, Aftab Shivdasani & Riteish Deshmukh reprise their roles & they are in top form. Vivek proves his versatility once again by portraying an out-and-out comic role, while Aftab & Riteish are already known for their exceptional comic-timing. Also, The Trio share a superb on-screen chemistry throughout. Sonali Kulkarni, Manjari Fadnis & Karishma Tanna are strictly okay. Maryam Zakaria, Kainaat Arora & Bruna Abdullah add a lot of glamour in the goings-on. Pradeep Rawat is excellent. Suresh Menon is funny. On the whole, 'Grand Masti' is a fun-ride that will be enjoyed by the Youth & Men." 
" A grand failure in an attempt to make the Indian 'American Pie'","First of all, I should thank with a disclaimer that I am not sure whether i am qualified enough to write about this load of tosh as i walked out of the theater after 30 minutes of sustained torture. My review is based on those 30 minutes. If somebody would make a disconnected movie out of all the adult rated jokes that you might have ever read, that somebody might end up making 'Grand Masti'. I thought i was going in for an Indianized version of the movies like 'American Pie', 'Eurotrip' et all, as i had thoroughly enjoyed them all. Believe me, its nothing like them!! The three heroes Rithesh, Vivek and Aftab run around cracking double meaning 'jokes' and scantly clad 'heroines'. The only aim is the obvious one and the movie is basically an attempt in finding whether they are successful or not. The clichéd-troubled Indian husbands - all action deprived for one stupid reason or the other, forms the basis of the movie. Indra Kumar sticks on to the formula of suspecting husband + husband of a traditional kharelu homemaker Indian wife for a deprived husband. Performance wise, I didn't watch enough to judge how the actors did but from what I saw Aftab desperately wanted to get back on to movies. Walk in: -If you can watch already read jokes on screen. -Vulgarity is your cup of tea. -Those which makes a common man cringe are 'jokes' for you. -If you want to torture a friend so bad that you do not mind going through the same ordeal yourself. -If you are looking at painful alternatives for suicide :)" 
" A gandi, BUT LOL type of film","Grand Masti is vulgar,raunchy,and down right obscene.But its a damn LAUGH RIOT.Pasia 2x vasool.Sets new standards for sex comedies in India.Grand Masti is about 3 friends that are married and go back to college for a reunion,and there is where they plan the Gand Masti.OH meant Grand;) Ritesh Deshmukh, Aftab Shivdansi, Vivek Oberoi are AMAZING in Grand Masti they make you laugh until you cry.Kudos to all 3 for pushing all boundaries in this film!!!Dir Indra Kumar pushes all boundaries with Grand Masti to make India's best and most original sex comedy!!! One must tips his hat to the dir for being fearless and making this film. Amazing job.At a personal level i loved Grand Masti can't remember the last time i laughed so much, only -was a thin plot, but the film makes up for all -.Grand Masti was so enjoyable also because i cant remember the last time i saw the audience of a film laugh so hard, holler and clap.ð???ð???ð??? Overall if wanna laugh until you cry,and don't mind crude,vulgar jokes then watch Grand Masti. Its India's best sex comedy,entertainment x10" 
" A must watch adult-comedy for the targeted audience","The greatest adult comedy movie ever.All the three heroes(Aftab,Ritesh and Vivek)are outstanding in comedy.Pradeep rawat and Suresh menon are too funny.Even some animals like a cat and a crow add to the laugh riot.This film makes you laugh out loud from start till end.All the scenes and jokes are simply hilarious.Even the songs are good and are energetic!Cinematography is nice.Director Indra Kumar has distinguished himself by making Grand Masti.It is guaranteed that your stomach will pain due to excessive laughing.But it is not a family movie so watch it only if you love rib-tickling comedies with limit-crossing jokes.HAVE MASTI IN A GRAND WAY!" 
" I cried a lot because of too much laugh","Its my first review on IMDb.Ignore what critics(I think they are not an adult) said.Just go for this movie with your friends(recommended) or wife or husband if you are an adult, looking for non stop laugh and entertainment and no objection for vulgarity. I don't understand people comes to watch movie for entertainment and this movie gives it. I want to ask a question to those critics who rated 0 or below to 2 to this movie. They have never seen porn in their life??? if so then those critics must be fan of pogo channel. This movie is much better than porn.Just go for it. You'll enjoyed this movie a lot."

If you are person who laughs on every PJ you get on your cell phone, than this movie is for you. The movie contains all the PJs that were ever forwarded to to your cell phone by your friends. The movie has copied a lot of scenes from foreign movies and the TV show Mr. Bean. A scene from the ace Ventura movie has been also copied. Some scenes from American Pie and a scene from a movie in which a girl pulls out stuff from a guys anus. Try watching it with very less of expectations and hard-ons.Peace Out "V""
