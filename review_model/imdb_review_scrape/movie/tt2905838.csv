" Bang Bang Thank you Man!","Bang Bang is a part Espionage Thriller, part Bollywood Revenge Drama, part Musical, part Romantic Comedy, and full Global Action Adventure that not just excels in its parts, but is also riveting as a whole. An official remake of 'Knight and Day' - this is a movie that will surely seem like a knight in shining armor for the adrenaline junkie awaiting a prince charming.Hrithik Roshan excels as the suave and sexy international thief on a mysterious mission of his own. With muscles of steel, eyes burning with a fire of passion, a body as fluid as water, and feet that seem to fly with the wind, Hrithik Roshak is truly in his elements here.Giving company to his Greek God looks is the demure damsel in distress - Katrina Kaif - who for a change is less of a seductress and more of a girl next door. She manages to somehow keep pace with the brilliant Mr Roshan and hold her own. The supporting cast - be it Jimmy Shergill, Danny Donzongpa, Jaaved Jaffrey, Kanwaljeet Singh, Deepti Naval, Pawan Malhotra, or the delicious Dadi spice up proceedings with measured performances that meet the need of the hour aptly.The action is truly stupendous and honestly much better than anything of "Spiderman 2" Andy Armstrong that I have seen so far. The cinematography, sets, locations, and costume design effectively add to the allure of breezy, hip, and yet picturesque scenes. Multiple international locations (Prague, London, Abu Dhabi, Phuket, and parts of Greece amongst others) and our very own India (Shimla, Kashmir, Manali, Mumbai, Delhi, etc) are captured in stunning visuals that will leave you gasping for that dream holiday you couldn't even dream of, and which Katrina as 'Harleen Kaur' gets to live.To be honest, the story isn't the most gripping of tales, and the screenplay wouldn't 'script' history even though Sujoy Ghosh of the taut "Kahaani" fame and the prolific Abbas Tyrewaala seem to have had a hand in this. But the action, faced paced screenplay, and taut direction by Siddharth Anand, who redeems himself after a forgettable "Anjaana Anjaani" more than makes up for it. The hit maker of Hum Tum, Salaam Namaste, and Bachna Ae Haseeno is back to business in dishing out an entertaining dish with a dash of superstar allure in the form of Hrithik and Katrina.Without giving too much away, I would like to summarize this as an apt action adventure film with tremendous production values, some foot tapping music (Vishal Shekhar), and outstanding choreography by Bosco-Cesar (especially Tu Meri and the title song - Bang Bang that pops up during the credits). Low on emotions, high on action, and about average on originality and recall value - this is a movie that starts and ends with a Bang and when it does, you might just say to Hrithik "Thank you Man!"" 
" Review + Experience of Bang Bang","I have been waiting for this since the time I saw the trailer of it. I hadn't liked the songs - but hey, lovely promos. So, when movie released I booked the tickets for Thursday night. I opened my twitter and FB on Thursday morning and in came the flow of negative reviews of the film. All the leading reviewers gave it 1.5 star. User reviews were still not available. My heart sank. I saw my 1000 bucks going in drainage. I checked to see if I can cancel my ticket - there wasn't any option. Wife said - no worries we'll see how it goes. I said to myself - well, it can't go poorer than Himmatwala that I had seen. I also did one more thing - I saw Knight and Day again in afternoon. I went in to see the film with my wife, sister and mother in law. I honestly had no expectations from the film after all the reviews I had read. After 80 minutes in the movie, we went for interval. I looked at my wife with an expression - "what the f**K all the negative reviews were about"? It was an entertaining first half and I was wondering if rest of the guys saw the same film? We decided to wait and finish the entire film and see if they have goofed it up anywhere in second part. After another 80 minutes or so, I was convinced, the reviews that I had been reading since morning were either mostly paid reviews or the people went in expecting a James Cameron film. Movie is not flawless, lets be honest. The first half is good, however second half could have been better. The fly-board based action sequence isn't placed very well. The climax is decent, but stuffed a bit. There were big news of how interesting the Abu Dhabhi chasing sequence is with 120 cars and all, but honestly it doesn't live up to the expectation. Formula 1 car driving is from no where and there aren't great scenes shot with it. The last scene of water plane is immediately after the F1 car and it seemed that last 15-20 minutes is stuffed with too much of an action. Songs are good, but they all look alike - there should have been some variety in there.Acting wise, Hrithik stole the show. Katrina and Hrithik I guess are best looking pair in Bollywood. They look superb together. Dance sequences are beautiful. Danny Denzogappa is wasted in the film. There isn't much of a scope for rest of the cast - wish they could have been synchronized better. Even with all the negatives, the visual treat that movie offers is superb. It is fast paced and no where you'll feel bored with what is on your screen. Style quotient of the film is very high and continuity has been maintained. You see Shimla / Prague and other places in the film - but they are connected and it just doesn't happen out of the blue. Suspense is well built and story, even though is not new, looks connected and nicely treated. Its an amazing attempt to make a progressive movie. Movies like these take a forward looking step for the Bollywood. I do hope, someday we'll see a Transformer as well, though I am convinced we have a long way to go. Its a movie I wouldn't mind to watch again if I have to. Its a great work and deserves a theater run." 
" Better.","I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure and Action movies in Bollywood I've ever seen.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is BRILLIANT. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. This movie defines Bollywood development.. and Hrthik is awesome in this movie... + dance scenes also so great music (restaurant scene)You should watch it, better then original!Also listen soundtrack after movie, i can't stop it!" 
" i want to bang my head","First of all, the movie is overrated at IMDb. It isn't worth even a review. Terrible remake (if not copy) of Knight and Day. It is the first time in my life i saw people talking to each other or leaving the cinema before the movie finished. why do the Bollywood directors keep on making these fantasy movies when everyone know that time has passed. The acting of Katrina Kaif was terrible largely due to overacting. The movie might attract the masses who just like fantasized action and a few sizzling numbers. Other than that, there is not script of the movie. Everything is predictable. It is the lowest Hrithik and Katrina have gone in their careers. Total waste of money." 
" Dhoom + Ek tha Tiger = Bang Bang","The formula to make a blockbuster is very easy. Some action, some romance, some comedy, mix in some songs and a beautiful cast, and voilà. See how there's no mention of the story-line. Because a masala movie don't really require one. That's not an issue however. Sometimes people just want to be entertained. Unfortunately movies like Bang Bang are made every year. The formula remains the same, only the cast changes. People who knows the formula watches the bootleg version online or waits couple of months to watch it on TV. People who are bored on the weekend go and watches it in theatre. And the success of these type of movie means people will continue to do so year after year. All I have to do is copy and paste this review every year.If I never watched a Hollywood movie, then I'll be as amazed as half the target audience who don't understand and watch English language films. Unfortunately Hollywood inspired or adapted Bollywood movies loses its charm when you saw the original many of times. Again not a problem for the producer and the director because they know exactly who their movie audience is. So keep an eye out every year for unoriginal masala movies to reign in box offices. It's up to you if you want to directly fund the next unoriginal journey. So what'll it be? Bootleg, TV, or theatre?" 
" Bang Bang is outstanding","I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure and Action movies in Bollywood I've ever seen.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fan boy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fan boy wants to see.The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored This movie defines MUST SEE.This movie defines bollywood development.. and Hrthik is awesome in this movie..." 
" Just watch the Original Knight & Day again!","When Bollywood filmmakers remake a Hollywood film, I wish they would stick to the same duration too! Bang Bang is the Indian remake of Knight and Day, which as far as I remember, was about 110 minutes but the running time of Bang Bang is 156 minutes! For a film with no head or tail, that's quite long!Harleen (Katrina Kaif) is a bank receptionist who lives with her grand mom-an enthusiastic woman who enters the bathroom when Harleen is having a shower to ask her why she has no boyfriends. Bored with her life, Harleen signs up for a blind date on a website. Enter trigger-happy thief Rajveer (Hrithik Roshan). He has robbed the Kohinoor from London, no less! Since her blind date has not turned up, Rajveer takes over and charms her. Of course there are people gunning for him because he has the Kohinoor and then starts the non-sense chase, which goes on till the end of the film. Since Harleen was spotted with him, she is in danger too so he has to take care of her and himself. So she will tag along everywhere he goes. While they are in danger they go from one place to another and also make time to sing a song at every fancy location.There are some terrible brand placements here like Mountain Dew-the hero of the film was made to drink it; he also had to say the tag line loud and clear, Dar ke aage jeet hai!The makers have obviously pumped in a lot of money here. From shooting in various places from Shimla to Abu Dhabi to Greece. The actors are seen using every mode of transport from speeding bikes, formula one cars, speed boat and even sea planes. If all this could make the film entertaining, the whopping budget would have been worth. There is a difference between spending money and wasting it. Apart from the rooftop jumping in Shimla, no action scene impressed me much. Teaser trailer had more BANG than the movie.Hrithik Roshan looks good and that's nothing new but don't expect any great acting here since he was just expected to run from one place to the other. Katrina Kaif was given a silly role and there was little she could do about it. Music by Vishal Shekhar is average. Only "Meherbaan" was the song that gave the full feel of what the movie should have been. And about the background score, just one word- BAD!If your idea of a fun film is watching two good looking stars running around senselessly for two hours and thirty minutes then go and watch Bang Bang.The makers have put in a lot of money. Is it wasted or well spent, only time will tell. I would suggest you save your hard earned money and watch Bang Bang on TV someday soon. That might be more satisfying. [2/5]" 
" Waste of Time and Money","This is just a mindless, senseless and meaningless film. Don't know how can one like this movie.Hrithik stole the Kohinoor diamond and all those 153 minutes he keeps escaping from the cops and co..Katrina has to do very little and she cannot act. A typical crap bollywood flick. There was nothing to rate it above 6 or 7. Some Indian people, actually most have rated it 10, I mean what the hell? Do they even know what a good movie means? The budget of this movie is around 150 crores but all the money are wasted. They have shoot-ed in various places around the globe but fails to impress in the acting and plot departments.I want my 153 minutes back! Don't watch it! Such a crap film." 
" 100% Copied from Knight and Day .. Utterly Disappointed !!!","I watched it 1st day 1st show with some high expectations from this film however from the very first scene till the end it was nothing but a bad remake of Knight and Day. Action, Dialogs, Drama, Theme everything (literally everything) was exactly copied.. there was nothing new in it.. no innovative ideas. I'm highly disappointed.Overacting of Katrina Kaif is unbearable. Verdict: Go watch Knight and Day. It is far better than this.Please +1 this review so others can be warned about the same and do not make the same mistake as I did." 
" Don't Worry If You Miss This","Bang Bang is official remake of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz's Knight And Day.There are many changes made in storyline.Siddharth Anand has done very nice direction.Music is given by Vishal-Shekhar.Hrithik Roshan has done good job.Katrina is good and awful in some scenes.Danny is superb is every scenes.Cameo of Jimmy Shergil is quite good.Storyline is slow.Movie gets more slower after interval.Songs made movie more boring.Songs are good except Uff but they break the chain of movie interest.First half is average and second one is awful.Even i don't wanna write more for this movie.AWFUL !!Overall,if you miss this movie then don't worry.You can watch if you want.Hardly one time watch.Not at all recommended!" 
" The title felt like punching on your face with each scene unfolding -- script less and awfully copy-ful","This is one awfully made movie I have watched in long time, seems as if director Siddharth Anand has determined to present us a next worse movie than he did last and he has succeeded here if not in making a good movie the least. This one is an official remake of another Flop "Knight and Day" released back in 2008, but the director declaring it an Official copy (err...remake) has taken the liberty of actually copying so many elements from so many movies not just from Hollywood but from our own Bollywood. Action sequences poor reminiscent of Ek Tha Tiger, Dhoom the sea beach scene reminiscing you of Kaho na pyaar hai...Don't know how many movies shall i mention here..even a moment where Katrina is offering here hand to a sinking Hrithik in sea, reminded me of a similar scene in Aamir's forgetful Talaash and Javed Jaffery felt to have a hangover of Singh is Kinng. Hardly anytime director have bothered to explain where Hrithik disappeared or how he managed jumping out of valley/bridge/hill or for that matter why worlds most wanted terrorists escaping from one of most secure prison takes only this little.Just a pure waste of money, let Siddharth squander those of his producers. Save yours." 
" Stop Stop....Mediocrity Alert!!!","Bang Bang is an official remake of Tom Cruise starrer Hollywood film Knight and Day. Some facts about Knight and Day: Estimated Budget: $117 Mn Estimated Gross Collections: $76.5 Mn It was a commercial entertainer with popular stars like Tom and Cameron which was supposed to make huge money but instead turned out to be a loss making venture. So when its production house Fox Studios decided to produce its Bollywood remake at a whopping cost of 140 Cr (~$22 Mn) you might question their business sense. But considering the recent big bollywood hits like Kick, Dhoom 3, Krrish 3 it was a good decision timed with a 5 days long festive weekend.Movie has all the right ingredients to set the cash registers ringing; Good looking lead pair, Fancy Locales, Breathtaking stunts (3-4), Peppy music but still the director has been able to turn this into a boring and yawning experience. Mind you this requires some talent.Film has a similar plot to the original one where Rajveer Nanda (Hrithik Roshan) is a stylish and immensely talented thief who has stolen Kohinoor diamond from London based on an open public challenge, to all concerned thieves, by an International terrorist Omar (Danny Denzongpa). For some reason (revealed in climax) Rajveer decides to not handover the diamond to Omar and this triggers a chase to get Kohinoor. Entire story revolves around this chase and ends with a long, tacky and glaringly clichéd climax.Katrina is weaved into the plot as she encounters Rajveer by accident in a café where she is waiting for her blind date from some Dating website. She does what she has been doing for the last 7-8 yrs i.e. to look dumb (quite natural in that), look beautiful and dance well. It will be a crime to expect anything more out of her as she chooses her movies based on her areas of strength.Other supporting actors don't have much to do as majority screen space is reserved for the lead pair. Still its refreshing to see actors like Kanwaljeet Singh and Deepti Nawal on screen after a long time.Films dialogs and climax will take you back to the 80s action cinema. Climax is the same 'we will take the heroine, get the diamond to save her' kind of which we have experience with Pran and Ranjeet. Only difference is that Kali Pahadi has been replaced by Picturesque Prague.Based on the trailer and hype surrounding the film, you might want to believe that it can be a decent watch but the long running time of 2 hrs 35 min makes you cry Stop the pain.It has to be seen how much profitable it turns out for the makers but with such a massive budget even a 200 Cr collection will not result in good profits.For the viewers only one thing. Mediocrity Alert!!! Watch it at your own boring risk!!" 
" Lousy, cheesy remake. Felt like banging my head on my punching bag.","Terrible remake of Knight and Day. The acting of Katrina Kaif was terrible largely due to overacting. We hav seen much better Hollywood films involving action, car scenes, somersault and riveting chases, aqua-stunts. Bakwaas n unnecessary songs. The writing is so inane that it left me exasperated.Back to back songs in the first half might put you to sleep.The story, villain, villain's henchmen, villain's ADDA everything looked as if I was watching a cheesy 80's Bollywood revenge movie. Dancing, flaunting six packs even if it's not required is getting monotonous. Lousy editing by Akiv Ali. Worst adapted screenplay by Sujoy Ghosh n Suresh Nair. Badly directed by Siddharth anand." 
" Horrible.","The film opens in UK where Colonel Viren Nanda (Jimmy Shergill) goes to meet a wanted terrorist Omar Zafar (Danny Denzongpa) in his holding cell. As Viren informs Zafar that he will be extradited back to India for his crimes, Zafar's men enter his holding cell, led by Hamid Gul (Jaaved Jaffrey), killing all guards around them, with Zaffar then killing Viren by shooting him and then burning him. As Zaffar escapes in a helicopter waiting on the roof, he puts a $5 million reward for someone to steal the Koh-i-Noor diamond from the Tower of London, but with one condition – the thief must be Indian, to hold up a new extradition treaty between India and UK. Soon after, a man named Rajveer Nanda (Hrithik Roshan) steals it, and when Zaffar's men are informed of the theft, they travel to Rajveer for the deal" 
" !!~ Waste of Money and Time ~!!","Oh lord! I was expecting to be a different type of "Hrithik" movie. But very disappointed. As usual, he shows off his body, his dancing skills, his eyes, ability to get girls, and just run. He is no different here. The movie is not more than an addition to his gallery of "hey look at my body". Same with Katrina. She looks utterly bored both in the movie and promotions. Typical mindless movie. The movie is a mix of mindless salman types of movies. There is no story, no flow whatsoever. The movie was opened in over 4000 theaters and solely relies on Kat's and Hrithik's fan base. And i think it is working. DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY! Instead donate or go eat something! Not worth your time and money!" 
" Great action but no script","What it's about: Classic revenge drama. Passports, immigration, and law enforcement don't seem to exist as Hrithik and Katrina jump from country to the country escaping the bad guys as they fall in love. Thankfully, there's a plentiful skin show from both of them and we get to ogle their bodies with beautiful backdrops of Greece, Prague, and of course, our very own Abu Dhabi.What's good: The music is the best part about Bang Bang. Hrithik has put all his muscles into the action stunts of this movie. IF you can let go of the logic, the action choreography in this movie is beyond anything I've seen in Hindi cinema so far. The movie also looks incredible visually. Each frame is picturesque and you're going to want to book a flight to an exotic destination soon after watching it. The VFX department has done a stupendous job, with your eyes being tricked even while your brain goes 'WTF?'What's not so good: Aye, I hate to say this – it's just bad this was my pose in the cinema for most of it). There's no script to speak of and logic doesn't just take a backseat, it sits outside of the cinema in the food court. Hrithik is a phenomenal actor but even he doesn't have a single memorable dialog in the film.Full review on DollzinDubai."
