" A fantastic and classic epic romance! A must watch!!","This movie had already garnered expectations of epic proportions due to the cast, crew and the director, Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali. This movie had been in the making for over a decade and hence had already created ample curiosity in the moviegoers minds. After watching the movie, I was at a loss of words. I don't even know where to begin! The music, screenplay, acting, dialogues and the beautiful story of 3 complex characters - everything is magnificent and spectacular! This movie is poetry in motion, easily one of the most epic tales in Indian history being translated in such a classy yet relatable manner on screen! Each scene and each dialogue gets the viewers completely hooked! People were involved and taken back into the 18th century - such was the appeal of the movie! The acting is PHENOMENAL! Ranveer Singh has always delivered fabulous performances, but this performance will be remembered until the end of his career as the performance that catapulted him into the hearts of the Indian cinema lovers. He has done a beyond brilliant job and as a viewer, we laugh, cry and root for him throughout the movie! He's the out and out star of the film. Priyanka Chopra is her usual magnificent self, nothing else can be expected of her after delivering award winning performances in Barfi and Mary Kom. She lights up the scenes she's in. It's amazing how she's good at dance, acting and emoting on screen! Her pain as Bajirao's first wife is captivating and makes the viewers feel for her! What else can be said about the ruling queen of Bollywood, Deepika Padukone, that hasn't already been written!! She is a spectacle all by herself! She makes us cry, laugh, weep, and look at her in awe! She's fabulous in the kathak number, "mohe rang do laal" and she shines in every scene of the film! Especially in the scene where she meets kashibai and in the scene where she is jailed! Her eyes are truly the window to Mastani's soul! She matches Ranveer''s energy and their chemistry is undoubtedly historic and classic! What fabulous acting! The supporting cast is a marvel in itself, Tanvi Azmi as Bajirao's mother is fantastic! Her acting abilities are par excellence, couldn't have imagined anyone else in that role! The music, costumes, scenery, sets and decor are exquisite! Nothing less can be expected from an SLB film! This movie is easily one of the top 5 cinema experiences in the past 10 years! It excels in both content and creativity! I will definitely be watching the movie again, it's simply addictive and outstanding and leaves a lasting impression on the viewers mind. A 10/10 experience! Loved it." 
" A Well-Made, Well-Acted Motion-Picture!","Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Mangum-Opus 'Bajirao Mastani' finally arrives. Been in the news for more than a decade, this period piece, fortunately, is worth the wait. Its A Well-Made, Well-Acted Motion-Picture, that holds your attention at most times.'Bajirao Mastani' narrates the story of the Maratha warrior Peshwa Bajirao I of the Maratha Empire (Ranveer Singh) and his second wife Mastani (Deepika Padukone). 'Bajirao Mastani' is epically mounted & Bhansali has Directed the film with enviable ambition. The scale of the film is something to watch! The visual appeal is tremendous. But, what makes 'Bajirao Mastani' further more memorable, is its human-conflict between its primary characters. The relationship of Bajirao & Mastani is sharp, and even the relationship between Bajirao & his first wife Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra), is compelling. Watching the warrior torn between love, politics & religion, often grabs your attention. I was involved in Bajirao's quest to give his women the respect they deserve, despite the evil-heads who intended to ruin it.Having said that, 'Bajirao Mastani' isn't without its share of blemishes. While the first-hour is arresting, the second-hour takes a dip & the pace drops. Also, the film overstays its welcome by a good 20-minutes, that certainly needed some trimming. A crisper & sharper second-hour would've only enhanced the overall impact!The Screenplay is fierce, but undeniably romantic & emotionally charged. The characters are nicely written out & so are their interactions. But, the second-hour needed a stronger punch. Bhansali's Direction is Grand. Its pure ambition, on celluloid. And the accomplished Filmmaker has handled the film with precision. Cinematography is Magnificent. Editing is mostly good, but it needed to be sharper. Art & Costume Design are flawlessly done. Action-Sequences are fabulously executed. Bhansali's Score is enchanting. Performance-Wise: Ranveer Singh is extraordinary Bajirao. The terrific actor sinks his teeth into the part & delvers a phenomenal performance. Right from his flawless Marathi diction, to his correctly done body-language, Ranveer scores a home-run. Deepika Padukone is wonderful as Mastani, portraying her part with complete honesty & understanding. Priyanka Chopra shines as Kashibai. She's in great form here. Tanvi Azmi as Radhabai, Bajirao's widowed mother, is electrifying. Its a pleasure to watch the veteran cast in a role that offers her scope to show her brilliance! On the whole, 'Bajirao Mastani' is definitely worth a watch." 
" Wonderful to look at - a great showcase for Indian film","I went to see this film while my wife was at the ballet. I don't watch many Bollywood films, and usually the lighter kind, so I was coming to this film with almost no context. Also, to me, this was a foreign language, subtitled film so I missed any subtleties of language.I really liked it. It was a true epic, wonderfully staged with seamless CGI and a consistent mellow look and feel to it. The leads (and lots of others) were really handsome/beautiful, and excellent actors. The dancing and singing was great and the story was well told. The costumes were sumptuous - Mughal miniatures come to life.To an Australian this was of course an exotic film, so although it was slow there was always something to be looking at and wondering about. On the con side, the Hindu / Moslem theme was hammered home rather obviously, the Brahmin priests were one-dimensionally nasty, and (apart from one boatman) everything took place in a idyllic palace bubble - punctuated by a few battles.However I would recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy an epic cinematic experience Indian-style." 
" excellent movie. much needed breath of fresh air","this movie helps restore the fast depleting hopes with Bollywood movies. The passion with which this movie is made shines through some class acts from each involved. the animation and sets allow a submerging experience. Ranveer offers a brilliant performance and a very promising future. His accented Hindi and well pronounced Marathi complete him in his role as Bajirao.Deepika and Priyanka are best fits in their roles and don't feel off track even for a bit. Priyanka does a good job of conveying with her expressions more than her words. The placement of songs is done nicely.a must watch for all moviegoers and history enthusiasts. the movie leaves us all with a good message at the end." 
" A must watch, complete balance between history and drama","the most awesome movie of this year came in the end that is Bajiao Mastani, there are no complaint about this movie from my side because there was no flaw in it except some of the cinematic errors. Even though I don't understand why it is reviewed 5.9 on IMDb after this. The things I like about the movie was that everyone acted perfectly, and everything was according to historical time line(sort of). Really like how Ranveer Singh and been moulded like an actor, Priyanka Chopra too was nice but should have been given more dialogs and Deepika Padukone as mastani was awesome no one would have acted like her. Awesome direction By Sanjay Leela Bhanshali,full marks to him for that. In the end everything in the movie was fantastic. IT TOO GIVES AN MORAL THAT LOVE IS NOT BINDED BY RELIGION. By which i come to the point that it delivers on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Love with Drama cliché's. On funny note I want to say that we've got Joffery Baratheon of Indian Film industry. The pairing of the movie was also fantastic, I thought after Goliyoon ki Raaslella the paring wouldn't work. And the movie was poetic too. The sets were awesome. On the Negative side there were lot of Overacting done by the actor Ranveer Singh, first I thought it was the script then I thought it was his acting, and there were some useless dialogue placement in the movie too which were not required at all. If this points were taken care off then it was surely 10/10 from my side.( I started grading it from 6) BOTTOM LINE: AN Awesome MOVIE, ONES WHICH WE CAN REMEMBER AND ALWAYS KEEP IN OUR DVD CASE." 
" 'Bajirao Mastani' transforms into 'Bajirao Kashi' - Liberty of cinema ★★★★★","The Story, Overview and Music: Sanjay Leela Bhansali is back with his 12 years old dream he nurtured like a baby titled as 'Bajirao Mastani', which is Bollywood's magnum opus and a reply to Tollywood's Bahubaali. Enthralling from beginning to end, the movie doesn't contain a single boring moment which is a huge plus point for its genre which can often be cumbersome and boring. And that can be large attributed to the visual aesthetics. Each and every frames are picture-perfect shots. From the very opening credits, you know that you are going to travel into a divine universe unraveling the 500 years ago's history (the 1700's). The sets and art direction are so well crafted, huge and super grand. Visual poetry on screen. Kudos to the set designers. The costumes, before describing, I would love to salute Anju Modi (costume designer) and Sanjay's vision of the past. Yes, they have rendered their imagination into a visual bonanza indeed. Ornamental is the perfect word. Every color that was picked for the costumes reflected a mood in addition to visual appeal. Applause! The cinematography is par excellence. The screenplay is multi- dimensional. It leaves you thirsty to know more. The background score is the "cherries on the cake". It is soothingly melodious in romantic scenes while explosive in war scenes. The action and the wars are new in Bollywood. First time a movie from Indian has excelled in such scenes. And the dialogues are a marvel. Very few films get you hooked up by its dialogues and Bajirao Mastani is one of them. There are many lines you will take home: the 'Guroor' one is pure cinematic and the 'Cheete ki chaal,..' is beautifully written and used cleverly. As for the music, the album has 10 tracks and SLB as the music director has done a magnificent job. The album is a beautiful blend of Marathi folk and Persian/Muslim influences. So, technically, the film is far superior than any Hindi movie I have seen in the last decade or so. The introductory portions in which they narrate the Peshwa's conquests using semi- animation/CGI were brilliantly performed. It's definitely one of the best of 2015. You are simply left mesmerized. You really are! The story of the film, I'll leave it for you to catch. I won't be a spoiler. I will just say that it is surely a love- triangle but one with a big difference. Star Performances: Ranveer Singh as the Peshwa Bajirao Ballad.- He is unbelievably good. Looks, body language, Maratha accent, physical strength in the war scenes. Hats off. I was skeptical about Malhari but it fits perfectly fine. His eyes spoke so many feelings. The anger, the love, the guilt, the passion, the pride, simply a WOW. I have always believed he's got a stupendous amount of untapped talent, and boy does this movie bring out the crazy range of acting skills that he possesses. He hit the right notes at all points. Mark my word, his performance shall make you a fan if you are not. This goes as his career best performance. He should win all 'Best Actor' awards for this. Deepika Padukone as the warrior princess is a marvel. She is beautiful, charming and stuns in songs like Deewani Mastani (I heart heart emoticon her in that). Her restrained half-Persian nuanced acting seemed to jump out less. Her character is one-dimensional. That's the minus point. Her biggest weakness being her poor kathak and you will feel sometimes in war scenes, she just lacked it and in romantic scenes, she went quite below par. Maybe due to parallel filming. She is undoubtedly a treat to watch but is overshadowed by Ranveer and Priyanka in acting. Nevertheless, she gives a remarkable performance but not her best. Priyanka Chopra as the Peshwin Queen Kashibai – *Breathe* Kashi was the most complex character of the film. It's an arc immensely enjoyable act at the same time heart- breaking. Kashibai might be an image of helplessness but it takes such strength for a woman to respect and protect the other woman your man fell in love with. Priyanka Chopra is terrific, her intelligently expressive eyes speaking volumes, she stood out in her Marathi intonations and prosody. Her no- nonsense Marathi rhythm was bang-on. Her each expression is layered with a thousand emotions, her dialogue delivery is pitch perfect and even in her dance her footwork is crisp and nimble. She crossed expectations in the film. She gets your eyes teary and your heart in pain. Her scenes are the highlights of the film and she owns them. In confrontation scene with Deepika where she goes "Dil? Kaisa dil?" gives you goosebumps. She knows her husband loves Mastani but she loves her husband. She can't hate him. The day she married Bajirao, she swore to support her man in his all decisions that make him happy. She knows her husband is no longer hers yet she doesn't want to lose him. The 'Guroor' scene where she calls her husband and tells him to go with his second wife is the scene of the year. In the climax, she comes to her ill husband but the latter calls her Mastani in hallucination and at that very moment you can feel her. She is devastated yet she pleases her husband by acting like Mastani. The lovers Bajirao and Mastani die but it is Kashi who is left behind all alone in pain. She takes forward the journey and raises Mastani's son as hers together with her two other sons. Priyanka's Kashi is so vivid that Deepika's Mastani pales in her comparison. In short, Priyanka Chopra has given a lifetime performance. You won't believe that the same Ranveer-Priyanka who played siblings in Dil Dhadakne Do have given such a soaring chemistry as husband-wife. Watch out for their love making scene. It's HOT. At the end Ranveer stands out, Deepika shines but Priyanka outshines. She leaves a legacy behind." 
" What a fantastic movie by Sanjay Leela Bhansali","Khamoshi, Black, Guzarish, Ram-Leela, Devdas and now Bajirao Mastani.This enigma called Sanjay Leela Bhansali lives only so that he just make films which lives forever. With a stellar cast he unfolds another epic love story, 'Bajirao Mastani', which has been a 12-year long dream said by Sanjay. One of the best Director of Hindi Films, his vision is big and presentation is a class.The music of 'Bajirao Mastani' is very pure and quite amazing. Beautiful music, beautiful locations, mind-blowing dressing and very energetic. Never saw a beginning of a movie as engaging as Bajirao Mastani. Its an epic film that leaves you wanting for more. I say, You must watch." 
" Priyanka acting was superb Bajirao Mastani a watch movie","Ranveer acting was great direction and music was superb Deepika looking beautiful location screen great a must watch a movie for everyone in your life everything is great go watch... Priyanka Chopra, on the other hand, is the better performer of the two in this film. Priyanka's Kashibai loves her husband to death. Each time Priyanka looks at Ranveer Singh her face lights up like a brightly-lit skyline. When Bajirao falls in love with another woman Kashibai doesn't surrender to destiny. She is no walkover. She protests. She sneers. She is angry. But finally for the sake of her husband's happiness and the larger good, she accepts the situation. Kashibai teaches us the most important lesson of this film. Acceptance of injustice is sometimes the opposite of cowardice. Priyanka conveys all these emotions with near-flawless comprehension of her character's inner world. This is her best to date." 
" Magestic Indian Epic Drama of Bajirao Peshwa not to be missed","Its an excellency of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, #BajiraoMastani is a Magestic Indian Epic Drama of Bajirao Peshwa. Whether its the majestic sets, beautiful music , performances of the star casts Sanjay Sir has excelled in each and every frame. After Baahubali this is one movie which is in Hindi originally that you can feel proud of watching it. Deepika is marvelous, Priyanka is excellent and ranveer singh is extraordinary.The song Deewani Mastani itself is a paisa vasool for the quality moviegoers.The war scenes are of world class and may remind you of any good war movies. Its a beautiful love story weaved in with the war plot.this is one movie which is not to be missed...Go for it" 
" Bajirao-Mastani should be lauded for surreal direction, exemplary CGI and commendable performances","As the epic love-tale of Bajirao-Mastani releases today, my joy knew no bound to watch it which has been in the news for quite some as Sanjay Leela Bhansali was determined to make a film on the lives of Peshwa Bajirao, Kashibai and Mastani for a long time.Barring Bahubali and Jodhaa Akhbar, Bollywood audiences are accepting the period drama in a big way. Can Bajirao Mastani continue the trend ? Well, we have to wait and watch for it.Bajirao Mastani tells the story about Baji Rao Ballal Balaji Bhat, widely known as Baji Rao I(played by Ranveer Singh), who was a brave warrior whose battlefield antics won him great accolades and praise from one and all. Much like his popularity on field, his personal life too was the center of attraction and his controversial love life with Mastani (Deepika Padukone) is the highlight of the film.The talented director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who gave us some memorable films like Khamoshi, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam , Black and some forgettable films like Saawariya and Ram- Leela goes one step back and does a good research on the history and culture of Maratha Warrior, Bajirao, who has not been defeated in battle for a straight 41 times. Kudos to Bhansali and team of writers (screenplay by Prakash R. Kapadia, additional screenplay by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Mallika Dutt Gharde) for doing good job. The battle sequences (action director by Sham Kaushal) have been executed brilliantly. The production design (Sriram Kannan Iyengar, Sujeet Subhash Sawant, Saloni Ankush Dhatrak] is eye-catching and will take you back to the forgotten history. The costume-design is mesmerizing. Music by Bhansali is tuneful especially coupled with well-executed choreography in 'Deewani Mastani', 'Albela Sajan' and 'Pinga' ( this one will remind you of Dola Re from Devdas). Cinematography is mindblowing along with good background score that gels with the mood of the film. However, the editing is loose and screenplay falls apart to some extent.Performance wise, it is Deepika Padukone all the way. She surprises with her charming , bubbly and yet fearless character whom you will fall in love immediately with her innocence. Ranveer Singh will hold your attention as powerful and mystical Bajirao and the actor exudes honoring performance. Priyanka Chopra does well as Kashibai. Tanvi Azmi is terrific.Overall, Bajirao-Mastani should be lauded for surreal direction, exemplary CGI and commendable performances. Good 3/5– Ketan Gupta" 
" BajiraoMastani is sheer brilliance!","Bajirao Mastani is sheer brilliance! An epic film that leaves you wanting for more.Realism as a word and theme remains obsolete in the exquisitely crafted world of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's fantasies.Visuals are elephantine.his characteristic style narrates his version of the story in a Mughal-e-azamesque scale of grandiosity, replete with breathtakingly beautiful sets (by Bhansali, Sujit Sriram and Saloni) elaborate and well thought of costumes and accessories (by Anju Modi) and dreamy cinematography. music, screenplay, acting, dialogues and the beautiful story of 3 complex characters - everything is magnificent and spectacular! This movie is poetry in motion, easily one of the most epic tales in Indian history being translated in such a classy yet relatable manner on screen! Each scene and each dialogue gets the viewers completely hooked! People were involved and taken back into the 18th century - such was the appeal of the movie! Ranveer is unbelievable & superlative as Bajirao. Priyanka chopra is amazing & Deepika padukone is just wow! This was your most nuanced performance till date !! Excellent .. !!" 
" Bajirao :An epic masterpiece","What a movie!!! It deserves its place rightfully among all the classics ever made and if any movie has the potential to come close to Mughl-e-Azam ,it is this one. Right from the script to the direction to the background score everything is spot on. Stellar performances only add cherry to the cake. Deepika Padukone,Ranveer Singh and PC are going to win a lot of awards this season.Bhansali's direction is crisp and boy ,those sets were awesome.Your eyes will be glued to the screen till the movie ends and you will wish that movie never ends.Such beauty!!! All in all it is a movie of a lifetime. Don't miss it at any cost !!!" 
" The best movie of 2015","An excellent piece of hard work by the entire team.Fantastic direction and commendable acting by Ranveer. Equally supported by Dipika and Priyanka.Fight scenes are class apart and really visualize the era it belongs to. Dance, emotions, set design...nothing falls short of the other.I did not watch old SLB films and this one makes me feel I must watch all now. The best is seeing Ranveer so mature and proving his presence in the lead role. Fully justified.Its been 24 hrs I watched this movie and it had such powerful impact that it is still running somewhere in the subconscious mind.Overall a real show of talent by all! Thanks to the entire crew for this remarkable effort and exploring these plots." 
" Marvelous performances...from direction to action","This is a wondrous saga...very much needed to revive the image created by "Ram Leela" which to me was an epic fail for all; writer, director and actors.....While booking the tickets, I thought there is much similarity between the "Ram Leela" and "Bajirao Mastani"...the lead characters, the historical plots and even the names of movies...Ram-Bajirao-Ranveer and Leela-Mastani-Deepika.... and hence, I went with the outlook of this one being an epic fail as well...but it turned out to be completely opposite....Sanjay Leela Bansali has, i would say, re-earned his name by working with same actors to create a marvel.....an epic love story after Devdas..I would like to adorn Bajirao Mastani with all the adjectives possible... perfect plot, perfect casting, impeccable direction, splendid screenplay with awesome dialogs awesomely delivered, super graphics and super duper acting by Ranveer, Deepika and Priyanka....Being a fan of romantic movies, I am left with another love story to savor...this is going to be on my favorite list from now on....And of course, I love you Deepika....." 
" A Blueprint on Over-Indulgent and Pretentious Cinema","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1.9/5 stars (0.4 stars solely for Ranveer Singh's performance)From the first frame, you know you are in a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film. Everything is scaled up, grander than grand. It's all razzle- dazzle, the way only Sanjay Leela Bhansali can turn it on. And then we tear our gaze away from the lush sets and the gorgeously attired actors – Priyanka Chopra as Bajirao's wife Kashibai, Deepika Padukone as the film's eponymous Mastani ( lover, concubine, second wife all rolled into one) and the equally beauteous Ranveer Singh - and demand the very thing we come to the movies for: a story unfolding on screen.But we chance upon that story only sporadically, in between all the song-and-dances and the set-pieces in the battlefields and the palaces and the sparkling chandeliers, which keeps bringing us back to our original query: Where's the plot point?Also, distorting history and not getting things perfect is one thing, but when a historical figure, revered and honored as much as the great Maratha Peshwa Bajirao is reduced to a new day Ranbir Kapoor in love, then that doesn't sit right by me, regardless of any number of disclaimers at the start. Thankfully, the film doesn't even pretend to be a faithful document of the events that took place in the early 1700s, when the Maratha Empire was in its ascendancy. The facts, such as they are recorded, are not allowed to weigh heavy upon this pretty edifice. There is some chatter of the "debauched Dilli Darbar" and ambitions for "poora Hindustan"; a few kohled, bearded Mughal invaders show up with their armies, and there a couple of scenes featuring a crafty Nizam. But these are stray mentions, and mere diversions - the real action in "Bajirao Mastani" is in the bedrooms and boudoirs and hallways, between Bajirao and brave Bundalkhandi lass Mastani, with Kashibai valiantly fighting a rearguard action.It is hard to imagine anyone else as Bajirao after Ranveer finishes chewing up the part and cracking the Marathi accent. He absolutely owns the film with his swagger, strut, passion, diction, bravado, and remarkably restrained emotions - an actor truly enjoying himself in a role. Priyanka's acquiescing wife has a couple of strong moments ( in fact, the only remotely felt sequence in the film belongs to Chopra and Tanvi Azmi - Bajirao's widowed, ambitious mother - as they ponder over the meaning of love and betrayal, and the man they are tied to). Padukone looks lovely as usual but hasn't melded with the part. Her Mastani is all dressed up but the performance is wishy- washy. She starts off smiling oddly through grim dialogues but has the exact same expression boys with lightsabers sport while making their own sound effects. Her Mastani is obsessed with Bajirao, and while it was perhaps the film's requirement that Padukone look giddily entranced, there are times when she appears completely lost. It doesn't help that she's entirely eaten up by Priyanka Chopra, who, while not in the title, holds her own against Ranveer's character with selflessness and dignity. Chopra's terrific in the part, her intelligently expressive eyes speaking volumes and her no-nonsense Marathi rhythm bang-on.Bhansali, for what it's worth, has gone all out with this one. He's made warrior girls play the banjo; he's made Old Spice salesmen look old; he's created outrageous subtexts about husbands and wives getting each other wet; and he's even saluted world cinema and raised a few red lanterns. But too quickly you tire of all the showiness. The grandiosity wears off. You long for a genuinely moving, exciting story, featuring all these beautiful actors, most of whom are able to pull off characters, but buried under their mounds of clothes. If only he had more to say than the fact that he loves "Mughal-e-Azam"." 
" An excellent SLB signature movie with Ranveer, Deepika n Priyanka at their best","What an amazing movie from SLB once again with beauuuuutiful sets, clothes, music and characters and an amazing story based on true facts, which current Indian cinema is lacking a lot. Acting is superb and the flow of movie is amazing. As always Sanjey movie depicts the depths of a fantasy imagination where even the pain is in beautiful colors. A must watch for people who love good music who love elegant sets and admire the grand ruins. Apart from sets the graphics job is done very well and war scenes are narrated in a true gladiator way. Clothes were drop dead gorgeous. I wish if any of my tailors could make such superb pieces.Deepika Ranveer and Priyanka did amazing job. Do watch you will remember it for a long time :)"
