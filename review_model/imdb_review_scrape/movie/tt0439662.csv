" Blown away by passion, dismantled by love...",""Fanaa" is not a word in common parlance. In Persian, Urdu, and chaste Hindi, it means "annihilated", "destroyed", or in the context of the latest offering from Yash-Raj Films, it signifies "devastated, ravaged, or consumed by love". Any film bearing such an intriguing, if somewhat grandiose, title would have the onus of living up to enormous expectations. In addition, this is Kajol's first film after a self-imposed hiatus, while Aamir Khan, paired with her here for the first time, is also seen infrequently on screen due to his reputed fastidiousness in choosing movie projects.I say good for them, for this is a superb collaboration between the actors. Aided by strong writing, a different story, able direction, and slick production values, they make it an entirely worthwhile proposition.The storyas much as I can divulge in a reviewstarts off in fairly formulaic boy-meets-girl fashion: Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol), a beautiful blind Kashmiri young woman, comes to the big city (New Delhi, in this case) for the very first time, after having lived a sheltered, happy life in a pristine little town in Kashmir. Right off the bat, she meets a tour guide with the gift of the gab and a roving eye named Rehan Quadri (Aamir Khan), and against the better judgment of her friends, takes up with him.Aamir looks a bit long in the tooth to be playing Romeo, but does so gamely, and successfully gets the smitten Zooni to agree to a no-strings romance. This is where I realized that the times, they are a-changing: sweet, blind (in more ways than one), sheltered Zooni is so consumed by love that she permits Rehan to bed her before he weds her, a phenomenon that is exceedingly rare (or used to be) in Hindi films. Her parents agree to the match, and the footloose Rehan readies himself for marriage to just one woman.Then hell breaks loose. Rehan is killed in a terrorist bomb blast, or so we are led to think, while the Indian authorities launch a search for the criminal mastermind that planned this and several similar attacks. Years later, a Major Ranjeev, bearing a disturbing resemblance to the dead Rehan, shows up. So what are we to think? From this point on, the film takes off into novel terrain, becoming an extremely satisfying viewing experience. Differing perspectives of nationalism and terrorism are exploredone man's terrorist act may also be looked at as a fight for an independent homelandas well as conventional familial and romantic relationships. Notions of love, loyalty, betrayal, patriotism, and morality get turned on their head, making for a pretty complex film. Is this overly ambitious for a commercial Hindi blockbuster? Perhaps, but the intellectual sophistication of the film-making team more or less pulls it off. There are some plot holes, but they can be overlooked in the interests of the big picture.Kajol grows in stature as an actor with every film, and her Zooni goes from naive and school-girlish to anguished widow and conflicted wifea challenging character arc, by any measureyet, she makes it truthful and believable with her wonderful transparency. Also wonderful is that neither motherhood, nor her absence from the screen for five years, have dimmed her youthful looks or charm. If anything, she is more svelte, and her face shines with increased character. Kajol has been blessed with sublimely expressive eyes, and now that she has acquired more life experience, they register even greater pain. One almost feels like looking away at times, to allow her privacy in her grief. I welcome her return to the screen, and if she displays similar care in choosing her next project, it will be worth the wait.Aamir Khan picks his projects with a mix of sensitivity and savvy, and presents the film-going public with a different persona each time. He contrasted his feisty village yokel role in "Lagaan" nicely with the glib, self-absorbed urban youth undone by love in "Dil Chahta Hai", so that in the same year, folks got to see two completely different Aamirs. I haven't seen his "The Rising: The Song of Mangal Pandey" or "Rang De Basanti" as yet, but I am confident that he burrowed deep into the souls of the characters of those films, too. Here he inhabits the skin and soul of Rehan Quadri/Major Ranjeev with total conviction and allows you into the thought processes of these men. He does look too old to do the romantic shtick demanded of the Rehan character, but comes into his own while playing the older Major Ranjeev, a profoundly troubled man dealing with adult ethical, ideological, and moral conundrums. To comment any more on his performance would be a disservice to the plot twists of the film, so I shall stop right here.The director, Kunal Kohli, handled the fun and light-hearted "Hum Tum" with aplomb, and here he tackles subjects far weightier than those of the Rani Mukherjee-Saif Ali Khan film. His occasional missteps result in some unevenness of pace and tone (which some judicious editing would have remedied), but with the overall wallop the film packs, these are minor lapses. I personally felt the second half of the film needed no songs, but that is my own quibble. The millions in the majority would have none of that, I'm sure. Aamir and Kajol do their own singing in a small but powerful scene, and this, I felt, was far more effective and poignant than the over-produced orchestrations of Jatin-Lalit and the vast array of playback singers they assembled.Rishi Kapoor, Kiron Kher, Tabu, and others offer strong support, while child actor Ali Hajji as young Rehan is amazingly unaffected and natural.After witnessing the combustible chemistry between Kajol and Aamir (why were they never paired together before?), and being privy to the volatile, seismic shifts in their relationship in this film, I conclude that "Fanaa" is indeed the title that says it best." 
" Loved it ....","It tickled me no end to read some viewers comment that a Kashmiri Muslim girl fell in love and allowed a man to bed her in a span of 8 days romance. They thought it slightly implausible. This might have held true for some two decades back but not nowadays. We have to understand Zooni (Kajol) came from a fairly modern family (she was no village bumpkin) in the movie and the apple of her parents eye. More so because she was blind and her mother always encouraged her to look forward to her Prince Charming the day he arrived. She was this inexperienced girl full of ideas of romance and blind to boot and Aamirs winsome voice and poetry won her over and she just went into the relationship headstrong girl that she was knowing and accepting that there might never be anything permanent (she just wanted to live for those 8 days she was able to be romanced by the person she was besotted with) a very common occurrence actually in todays scenario.The story of a man torn between love and duty might be hackneyed but I sure as hell didn't know how it was all going to end and was eager to sit through the whole film and watch it to the very end. I don't know how some people thought the first 90 minutes was horrible and the rest even more so! I found the first half extremely entertaining and the second half was a pleasure to watch just for the sheer pleasure of watching two very high class actors perform as they never have.Kunal Kohli is an extremely sensitive director and while there may have been slip ups in pace here and there (it was an emotional rather than an action packed movie after all) on the whole the movie shows a director of competence and someone who has a very bright future.The cinematography is breathtaking and the supporting cast of Rishi Kapoor and Tabu adds to the movies worth. Rishi especially is brilliant.But the movies strongest point is the performance of the two lead actors especially Kajol who had the more author backed role. Kajol and Aamirs chemistry leave you wondering WHY they never acted together before. And they look so good its hard to imagine Kajols a mom and Aamir a divorced dad of two." 
" Amazing chemistry !!!!!!!!!","This is hands down the best romantic film since .....well in a long time , all the people i know who haven't liked this film is because its got impossible situations in it and its slow in the 2nd half all i have to say : stop watching Hindi films then and continue watching 25 sec ads which have diminished your attention span .The characters are given amazing dept and lo and behold they take the film to an all new high .Kajol has proved shes the best actress of her generation and with this film is giving serious competion to her late legendary aunt nutun as the best actress of the family .Aamir is splendid though i felt his character got a bit sketchy in the 2nd half not his fault the director and writer could have made his motives more clearer for us . however what ever hes given to work with he electrifies every scene hes in .kudos to all the crew especially kunal kohli" 
" thought-provoking","Fanaa- This truly is a good movie- not just in the entertaining sense. There are a few bloopers, of course, but they may be easily overlooked, an easy enough thing for sensible and regular watchers of Indian cinema. True, Aamir and Kajol have performed brilliantly, the cinematography is excellent and the music heavenly. The background scores are worth more than a mention.But the movie goes deeper and makes one think about the power of love and our utter helplessness before it... how it shapes one's life and choices. The importance of choice is given the limelight in this movie- the choices that are so unique and personal to each of us, given the same situation. It also asks, importantly, how much can love forgive?Put yourself in the place of these characters as you watch the movie and see how much is asked of you at each step, what strength is required to make the choices they make.This movie, in some ways, is a lesson in love. It puts to shame our cautiousness, rigid moral standards, emotional walls etc in love. You cannot walk into love with tiny steps, wearing a steel armor and praying not to get hurt. There is no such thing as going too fast or too slow, or all these clichés we've come up with to explain relationships :)To love, you truly HAVE to be free. At heart." 
" Fanaa is a dream that stays in the heart foever!","Fanaa is a love story which has been written as a love story ,directed as a love story and acted like a love story. Fanna belongs totally to Aamir and Kajol ,who both have delivered a brilliant performance. Kajol plays Zooni with such a class and natural , she reached ,with Fanaa, a place that no other actress ,today, can reach or even come close.she was breathtaking. Aamir plays Rehan, though it's a unusual role that many of Bollywood actors would turn down(nobody wants to play the anti-hero anymore), he makes it real to the core,you follow him through the whole transition of his character,you love him and you hate him at the same time !Aamir is the master of acting today. The chemistry between Aamir and Kajol was terrific!Kajol matches Aamir ,like the sun matches the sky,they delighted every frame of the screen! an award the best Jodi of 2006 will be simply fair! The other actors were efficient! The music of Fanaa is beautiful and the videos makes it just better:a high note to Dekho Na,Kunal managed to control the little space of the shot with ease and closeups of Aamir and Kajol were fantastic.however,it's Mere Haath Me that steals the show,it was just superb,and it will be fair enough to say that this video will be the reference for any romantic song !(the reference was for a long time,Suraj Hua Madham of k3g). the script of Fanaa has some mistakes for sure,but when you watch Aamir and Kajol together you just forget and forgive! Beautifully shot,Fanaa makes you following the journey of two lovers who maybe wanted and deserved their part of happiness,so they knocked the heaven's door but another destiny was writing for them. go watch Fanaa once for Kajol,twice for Aamir,a third time for Aamir and Kajol,and watch it again and again and again for all those reasons!" 
" A complex love movie with a brilliant second half","Fanaa is a complex movie. Aamir Khan has continued his trend of working on unusual plots and delivering extraordinary performances and Kajol has outshone Aamir on many occasions in the film.The emotional intensity of the movie gets to the core of the viewer's heart. It may help people to look at the Kashmir issue from a different angle but it does certainly portray one fact, and that is a seemingly ruthless terrorist can actually be a simple and kind man fighting for his land's freedom. For him, making judgement on greater good or lesser evil is a constant struggle. Even though Rehan (Aamir) did not derail from his cause (terorrism apparently) till the last breath in his body, he will draw sympathy from the viewers.The splendor of light, sound and colors in big budget Hindi movies is achieving new heights every day. Viewers will be simply spellbound to the screen during most of the song sequences. The music of the movie was like a breath of fresh air. The viewers will also enjoy a ride of convincing and innovative action sequences.The first half of the movie could have been made better though. Sometimes the pace felt a little off. The constant exchange of poetry did feel irritating at times. Perhaps, if Aamir could shed off a few kilos, things could have looked a little more natural. It was also unusual for a blind Muslim girl like Zooni (Kajol) to indulge into a physical relation with Rehan (who did not pledge any commitment to their relation) so early. But I guess these things follow typical commercial Hindi film unofficial rules.Overall the movie is certainly worth watching and, compared to most of the Hindi films, quite a unique one." 
" Fanaa = true Bollywood film","After all the recent pornographic movies such as Murder and the like, it's really refreshing to have a D E C E N T Indian film which the entire family can watch. Sure the film wasn't brilliant but it beats the other crap Bollywood has been spewing out ever since the arrival of Mr. Imran-Gigolo-Hashmi. What a treat to see Kajol on screen again. She truly is the gem in the crown of Indian cinema. And as for Aamir...well, his done it again. After his stellar performance in Rang De Basanti, he pulls off the role of Rehan with immense warmth and passion. I know this is probably a pipe-dream, but it would be fantastic to see these 2 set the big screen ablaze again. Kudos to Kunal Kohli for reminding the world of what a true Bollywood film is made of!" 
" Fanaa is like reading a 19th Century English Novel","Well, if you have had that experience you will know what I am talking about. The character of Zooni is straight out of Bronte sisters' romantic novels. The strong willed, intelligent girl out to meet her prince, the supportive mother, the mysterious and charming lover, the lonely house in the middle of nowhere, the retired colonel as the only family friend who sometimes comes and shares a drink with the father; it's all there.Fanaa is one of the most intense romantic movies to have come out of Bollywood for a long time. Perhaps, since Silsila. The pairing of two of the best actors of our generation (maybe, perhaps of all time) needed a story just like Fanaa. You need to scratch the surface to reveal the passion of this unique love story. The director, Kunal Kohli has exploited the potential of this pairing admirably. Look at the picturisation of the song 'Dekho Na'. The camera hardly seems to move away from the two faces. There are innumerable scenes in the film where just these two faces share the screen.It is hard to think of any other actors from the present who would be able to pull off such a form of narration. Ultimately, the film belongs to Zooni and Kajol comes out with her best performance to date. Rehan asks, "KOI KISISE ITNA PYAR KAISE KAR SAKTA HAI?" and it shows in Zooni's eyes. What a role to make a come back and what a performance to make a comeback! And Aamir never ceases to surprise. He holds his own in a story primarily about Zooni and complements her character brilliantly. His performance is so amazingly understated, and yet so powerful. Rehan is one of the most complex and difficult characters played by Aamir. And it's all about the characters of Rehan and Zooni, their ideals, their emotions, their dreams and their passion. It's really like reading a 19th century English novel. It is not easy to narrate a story this way in a mainstream film and this is where the narration stumbles. The scene where Rehan takes Zooni from the train and carries her in his arms looks very cliché and awfully out of place. The tag line '.....TERE ISHQ MEIN MERI JAAN FANAA HO JAYE' is repeated to death in the film. There have been some cinematic liberties taken in the screenplay, like Rehan infiltrating the Indian Army, Zooni fumbling with the radio transmitter and speaking to the right people. The Urdu couplets, although all very good, seem to hold back the flow a bit. Also, the discussion on the political history of Kashmir at the meeting of the Intelligence Heads seems a bit off track. A better place to put that discussion would have been a friendly chat between Rehan and Zulfi (Zooni's father)over a drink.But these are minor skirmishes in a remarkable film. The story remains true to the title of the film and if you have a liking for 19th century English novels, you would simply love this one." 
" Fanna is all about Aamir and Kajol","OK the much awaited movie. Aamir after RDB and Kajol after a long break. The movie starts off with some brilliant locales and Kajol going to Delhi for a dance program where she encounters Rehan (Aamir). The sher- shayari bit in the first half is really good maybe coz of the way Aamir says it .Then there's a twist in the tale just before the interval and the story changes. I don't want to write a professional review , just things which i felt. First of all the side cast is amazing . They have been well chosen and do justice to their roles . The story is pretty mediocre . Aamir is fantastic as the happy-go-lucky tourist guide and Kajol glistens as the docile , demure blind girl.There are instances of Kunal Kohli's trademark sequences like putting songs where they just aren't necessary and some elongation of scenes . But the thing that makes this movie from being a common fare to a must watch are Aamir and Kajol . Their screen presence is amazing and the chemistry they share was just too good. They are the only 2 actors who could make a simple hug look like the reunion between two lovers . The ending sequence was also brilliantly handled .There are many mixed reviews to this movie . As i normally don't like any of the Yash Raj movies , this one i found to be quite touching . I would recommend this movie just for the magic that Aamir and Kajol create on the screen." 
" A well made film by Kunal, different film from others","A great made after the comedy Hum Tum. Kunal have done a brilliant job. He had wrote the dialogs, the story brilliantly. I think its totally different film of Indian cinema. As bollywood freak I recommend this film to all audience even to kids too. Its has huge stars and brilliant director. Kunal gave his best even more than Hum Tum. Way to go Kunal you surely winning in this year. Nominations for sure even awards too. I believe you deserve more this year than Karan Johar from KANK. The direction you made has been the best. I even liked KANK but after I saw Fanaa I think its a way different film and making its mark separate from all films from past. The direction of Kunal has been the best direction I seen so far this year. This film should win the best-playback and direction as well. The film stars huge cast for sure. It has Rishi Kapoor whom I really adore. He is brilliant even in small role of a father. Aamir Khan is superb just superb. I can't even say in words how he gave his performance. Great comeback from KAJOL. I am a huge fan of her since I began seeing films. Kajol is the best actress ever of new generation.After K3G she has made a great come back. Her performance is just brilliant. Its just marvelous. She was truly character in the film. It for one second you can't say that she is not acting as blind. Her acting is better than Rani from black. I don't say Rani didn't act good but she was good but Kajol is the best in blind role. The film is a must see. When you think you know whats happening but the second next you don't. The dialogs are written brilliantly. The lyrics are just very touchy. The music is worth it that you can't even comment because it's from the soul. Sonu sang the song beautifully. The Tere haath main mera haath ho. This song is sang by Sonu Nigam beautifully. I think he should win awards this year from this song from Fanaa. The tittle song from Kank he also sang brilliantly but he sang this song even better. Yashraj are still ruling. Making the greatest movies. Bollywood awards sometimes are differ from our choices but if i was the jury I would the award for best director of this film. I would also give Sonu for best playback singer from Tere Haath mein Mera haath ho. I would also give the award for best story and dialogs . An excellent film. I am sure this film is getting many awards but these i mentioned I think it should be the winners. As far as acting Kajol is the best and should get an award too. Aamir is brilliant but I think Shah Rukh has acted better in KANK. Kirron Kher is in both so i can't say but she is not much in this film. I give this film 1000000 out of 1000000." 
" I'm not so sure........","OK.........this has been the most over rated movie of recent times.  Albeit, kajol looks good, and aamir is amazing (as usual), the kid is  really cute, and the cinematography breathtaking...........but the  movie still lacks punch. I went in for the movie expecting a lot, and  came out laughing because it turned out to be so predictable. The  initial bits in Delhi were very well done. The movie moves at a quick  pace, and for everone who likes Delhi, you'll love these parts. Aamir  unfortunately looks old, and his shers get tiring after the first 5 or  so, but overall it is quite enjoyable.  Just before the interval, when Aamir's true identity is revealed, the  movie takes a turn to the over the top "main hoon na" or "men in black"  type story line. It actually becomes quite amusing at times. As soon as  he starts looking good, the story goes down the chute. Reminiscent of  "behind enemy lines" the snow chase sequence just didn't fit into the  movie. Being glorified as a terrorist just didn't go down too well with  me.   The saving grace in the movie, and probably the only memorable scene  after the interval was the one in which they have the small antakshari  exchange, and he tells her who he is.   The "climax" lacks impact, and simply fizzles out. It was a fitting end  to a pretty much, forgettable movie.   The background music was very powerful, and the songs fitted quite well  into the movie. I enjoyed them a lot more than when I first listened to  them   My advise,watch the movie............only for the acting. Expect  nothing from the story, and you won't be disappointed. ENJOY!!" 
" One of the best move Bollywood ever made","I watched this movie last night and was quite thrilled with it. Aamir Khan and Kajol were both at their best. One of the other comments already has the story told so I would not tell what happens in the movie, but I will tell this much that most of the Bollywood movies that I get to watch are filled with flaws and stupidities, but this movie by far exceeds my expectation. The movies has a very humorous start, however, the ending is quite sad, but that was meant to be by the title of the movie "Fanaa". The music was quite different and very enchanting. The supporting actors/actresses (rishi kapoor, Haji Ali) did very good in the movie. Overall, the movie is excellent and worth watching, Bollywood does not produce such movies that often." 
" Elegant and sensitive act","The most sensitive romance enacted by Bollywood. Fanaa is the epitome of elegant love story brought alive by the two world class and best ever actors in Bollywood, Kajol and Aamir Khan.All the scenes by Aamir and Kajol, which represents the majority of the movie, are worth repeating watching on the big screen. Their scenes tugs your heart in happiness, regrets, hopes, sadness, helplessness and so on.Little flaws in the narration of the movie (which are basically negligible, compared to other Bollywood flicks and even many of Hollywood flicks) are forgiven by the powerful yet very subtle act by the two actors.Excellent, go watch it." 
" "Eye of the Needle" plagiarised","The second half of this movie seems to be largely inspired by "Eye of the Needle" which I had watched twenty years back. It starred Donald Sutherland. "Eye of the Needle" has the backdrop of World War II. A German spy gets marooned on a desolate British island colony, probably Gibraltar. He falls in love with a woman who stays on the island with her crippled husband and their son. She too falls for the hero. When she learns about the hero being a spy she mercilessly shoots him. The tag-line of the movie ran like 'it is easy to love an enemy but difficult to kill a lover' (not verbatim). Replace the island by Kashmir made inaccessible in winter. Replace the German spy by lost husband terrorist. Crippled husband by alcoholic father. Presto, you get "Fanaa".The story writer (who won a Filmfare award for this movie!) owes us an explanation." 
" Fanaa","Whilst i agree that the film is well directed,has a fine script and has wonderful performances from the main stars i am totally taken aback and disgusted at the false ideals that are presented in it.In short the film is a mockery of the struggle of the Kashmiri nation and a defilement of the Kashmiri woman.Kashmir is fighting for its freedom from Indian occupation and atrocities that are indescribable.There is no Kashmiri woman or man who will put the glory of India before the life of a Kashmiri man no matter if he is a terrorist or not.Whoever conceived this idea is either a fool or an enemy of Kashmir.Show me a Kashmiri who is loyal to India and i will show you a traitor.Perhaps Aamir Khan knew this.He is very restrained and sullen throughout the film.Kajol looks more a Bombayite than a Kashmiri and Rishi Kapoor is also unsuitable.We know that Bollywood always take the leaf and goods from Hollywood but whereas Hollywood is renowned for exposing the naked and painful truth Bollywood tends to twist reality to suit the ideals of the Indian state.India has long hid the facts about Kashmir, failed to honour its policies including the one of leaving the Kashmiris to decide their own fate and this film is just another example of hoodwinking the West and ignorant minds in the sub-continent.What better then to do it through the screen idol of the millions...the mighty Khan!I wonder whether he is aware that millions of Kashmiri women have been raped,looted and murdered by Indian troops.So much for Bollywood glory!." 
" plot holes","This movies had nothing going for it except for the cast and music. The dialoges were unfunny where they were meant to be. The characters were totally unbelievable. Where can a guide get away with flirting blatantly with group of girls. Why does a terrorist have to work as a guide in the first place ? Of all the cabins in all the world be had to land up on her doorstep. The cabin does not have a doctor or any kind of communication ( they do have cable TV) the boy does not need to do to school yet an army officer ( satish shah) manages to land up asking for rum. Rehan cannot leave because of the storm but manages to sing a song on a clear day. Don't get me started on the regaining of eye sight. Nirupana roy getting the sight back in amar akhbar anthony was more believable .pulleese. After all this we are supposed to sympathize with these characters. The producers lost interest after the casting it seems. The scene where Aamir returns after killing Rishi Kapoor is a lift from 'eye of the needle'"
