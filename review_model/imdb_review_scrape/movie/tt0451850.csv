" Fabulous!","This film is absolutely excellent. The film was well-made. Great script and there was plenty of time to build relationships. Unlike the recent Indian movies that seem to be pointless and fast-paced and songs placed right-left and centre. This film is much better than Devdas. The colours, the songs, the acting, directing, producing and the cinematography are just brilliant. However you should not watch this film if you are a sceptic of folk tales and myths because this story is a Rajasthani folk tale so the people who will find this 'UTTERLY STUPID' are people who hate folktales or hate Bollywood films. This will go in the classics, I hope this gets the international recognition it deserves." 
" Between the lines of the story...","A man submits himself completely rules laid down by his forefathers. His accounts are important to him than looking at his beautiful bride. His father's suggestions and warnings are his foremost considerations; his wife's desires are secondary. His money-earning prospects are his main essentials compared to spend some time with his wife. A woman has no choice other than that chosen by either her elders or her husband. She cannot stop herself from dreaming: dreams of colourful bangles, dreams of new dresses, dreams of her husband and dreams of a sweet love. That, dreams come true, is just a hope. And where dreams can come true is a fictitious tale. The tale creates an invincible character, a ghost that fills the void in the woman's life: the void of love left by her man. This ghost is an epitome of all what a woman expects from a man." 
" Once upon a mythical time.......","I went to see this title purely out of curiosity - amol palekar, being more than a revered god in our household and srk's grand charisma covering all promos from head to toe. Also, rani mukherjee and big b in the cast certainly added to the shimmer.What i found was something more......The child in me arose as I no longer remained in the theater but, moved to my childhood room with grandma telling me an exquisite tale - of a land far far away. A land where the arid, parched environs sharply contrast with the rich color of the people and melody flowing with the air.The tale is simple. The narration; funny and colorful.A childish princess(rani) comes to her groom's (shahrukh) household with hopes of bliss and true love - finding a true-to-bone abacus instead. He leaves her the next day to set up a business in a distant town. As fate would have it, someone who truly loves the bride now enters her life - a ghost! This ghost takes on her husband's appearance (though confessing to her) and lives with her for a few years.The real groom now returns and everyone is baffled. The bride however faces the real paheli - should her husband be the one who took marital vows with her or the one who loved her? Though the movie looks like another glitzy tale from lala land, there is much more to it. Beyond the exotic tanishq( the jewel sponsor for the film) stones, CGI effects and tall Khan tales lies a true gem, that brings back a twinkle in the eyes, of a memory long forgotten." 
" At last a movie that doesn't look to the west for inspiration...","I am a bit sick of all the movies that Bollywood that has been churning out recently with an emphasis on skin show and a story line that follows a course of some not so great to begin with Hollywood movie. With that in mind, movies like Swades, Black and now Paheli at least leave some hope that not all film-makers are out of ideas. Paheli as many may know is based on an Indian novel 'Duvidha' by Vijay Detha. The novel centers on a love story between a ghost and a woman whose husband leaves her on the night of their marriage to go on a business trip. Amol Palekar took over the reigns for this telling, which is the novels second bow on the big screen. I must admit this is the first time that I have seen a movie directed by Palekar, and he has left me with a good taste so I'm sure to rummage through some movie store looking for more of his work. The story is a might unbelievable, but it is told in a simple way and no attempt is made to make the viewer believe such things actually happen. I think thats what really helps here, there is no painful drawn out explanation of why things are so, the story is just presented and the audience is allowed to believe what they may. And judging from the reaction I saw most people in the theater really enjoyed the movie. The performances are really strong. Rani is great first a rejected bride and then a woman who finds true love with a ghost. Also for me Anupam Kher as the greedy family patriarch really stands out with his comedic act, had me cracking up at regular intervals. SRK, well I already said I was a big fan, and this performance is just another one to add to win column. Where I don't think this is one of the finest performances of his career, it should at least appease those who are always accusing him of lacking versatility. Yeah I mean really every other actor has won an award for Best Villain, a Critics Award and a plethora of Best Actor awards for their monotonous work. A great movie, something different and definitely one well worth the watch." 
" Paheli: Shah Rukh Redeemed, Juhi Shines","Paheli is an unusual film on the subject of women's rights disguised as a love story. It is basically the story of a young woman, Lachchi (Rani Mukherjee) who is abandoned by her husband Kishan (Shah Rukh Khan) the day after their wedding. A spirit who falls in love with Lachchi on her way home comes to find out that the husband will be away for 5 years and so he takes the form of Kishan and lives with Lachchi for the next four years. Eventually, of course, the husband returns and Lachchi must choose between the two. How the story is resolved answers the 'paheli' (riddle) of the film.The film works well for several reasons: acting on the parts of all principal players is quite good, the visuals and cinematography is breathtaking and the theme is quite unusual, especially for a Bollywood film. It does have its drawbacks, though: there are at least two too many songs, and the film ultimately becomes the ghost's story when it should have been Lachchi's.Shah Rukh Khan delivers his most restrained, understated and likable performance in years; it is because of this performance that he still qualifies as one of India's quality actors. Rani Mukherjee is also sufficiently restrained (unlike her overacted performance in the overblown 'Black' or the overstretched attempts at humor in 'Bunty Aur Bubli'). She gives Lachchi a likable innocence without overdoing the vulnerability part. It is the kind of part one would expect an actress of Tabu's calibre to play.Anupam Kher and Rajpal Yadav play their parts with gusto. Amitabh Bachchan as the wandering shepherd milks his 5 minute cameo for all it's worth. Sunil Shetty, with all of two lines, is utterly wasted.It is Juhi Chawla, however, who delivers the most dignified and poignant portrayal in 'Paheli': even in moments when she has very little or no dialogue, her silently suffering Gajrobai speaks volumes through wary visages and a body language that speaks of years of defeat. I kept hoping to see more of her throughout the film, and though she is definitely there, it's not enough. Her story is far more heartbreaking than Lachchi's and deserved more attention. Juhi has become a perfectionist as an actress: the forbidding longing on her face as she watches Lachchi leave for ritual prayers, or her sheer disbelief at the return of the husband who abandoned her is award-worthy acting. Everyone's favorite giggling heroine has emerged into a tour de force dramatic talent. Believe it or not, she *is* the new Shabana Azmi. If Bollywood has any sense at all, films will be made just so she can act in them.Paheli is a likable, unusual film. Watch it for Shah Rukh (who is mercifully restrained), watch it for the story (which is unusual and relevant), but most of all watch it for the few fleeting moments of Juhi Chawla's revelatory brilliance." 
" Charm times 2!!","A fairy tale set in a time long ago, with ghosts, apparitions, camel races, vibrant and often clashing colors, divine music, innocence and love - what is to not like? Rani is the young innocent bride Lachchi who gets married and starts on a journey to her new home. Shah Rukh is the accounts obsessed ever obedient groom (Kisen) who has to leave right after marriage to go for business to another town far away. The ghost is a bird, a squirrel, an apparition who falls in love with the bride and eventually takes the form of the groom upon his departure. All is well with the new bride and "groom" until the real guy starts to miss his new bride and decides to come home. Confusion reigns, and the riddle as to who is the real Kisen is solved by a shepherd (Amitabh in an understandably over the top acted cameo).The good - Rani is divine, looks and acts the part with a deftness and light hand. She makes unconventional choices that perhaps account for why the Indian public did not much like Paheli - I cannot give away more. Aadhi Raat jab chand dhale - amazingly performed.Shah Rukh - times 2 and well done in both forms. One wonders if we take our 5 senses for granted and what it would be like to not have experienced them at all or not in a long time. See the SRK as ghost apparition with the wonder on his face at the first touch from a mother, at the look at the beautiful house, the joy in playing with the children (brothers sisters nephews), to find out. SRK as Kisen who finally realizes that he is missing his wife very much - the most understated sadness ever seen from him.The costumes are amazing - much has been made of the costumes in Devdas - but this is authentic Rajasthan at its very best and most colorful, the jewelry will make any woman drool! The music is divine - Aaadhi Raat, Dheere Jalna are outstanding numbers.The bad - well very little in my opinion. Maybe the dance when they find water could be cut, but the movie was pretty short anyway. The camel race was a little over the top, but perhaps okay if you keep the fairy tale genre in mind. Logical flaws - come on, its a fairy tale after all!! Like there is any logic in ghosts and fairies..I was transported back to my childhood with the story, enchanted by the colors and music and very much enjoyed the portrayals of the ghost/Kisen and Lachchi. Anupam Kher was good as the avaricious father. And of course there was the sublime Juhi - better than I have ever seen her in a cameo as the sad aunt, few words were said, she did it all with her eyes. Please come back Juhi, we miss you!" 
" An amazingly thoughtful and sensitive movie","What a movie.Wow I went in with high expectations, although I fully expected to be disappointed.I wasn't.Mr Palekar has produced a beautifully thought out, well crafted movie, in which he has pulled performances of extremely high standards from all the cast.The only slow point first-- Juhi's story was wasted with a hurried ending that left us unsatisfied-- other than flashbacks, we had no interaction between Juhi and Suniel Shetty. But throughout the movie-- Juhi spoke with her eyes! The rest of the film-- what an achievement.SRK and Rani Mukerjee-- what a couple, they have almost the same level of chemistry as SRK and Kajol.Rani looked gorgeous, dressed in styles which suited her, and I (a female myself) could understand why a ghost would fall in love with her after one look.SRK looked wonderful, managing to convey the differences between the two characters he portrayed with body language alone. The main thing-- NO GIMMICKY ACTING.All the other character actors were pitch perfect.AS to the story, the romance of it all left me heartbroken, for in every love triangle there must be one loser. And indeed this was a love triangle, as, in SRK's portrayal of the distant husband, you saw the love and need for his wife.Could there have been anything more heartbreaking that the thought that this poor man is alone with his dreams for 4 years, while his wife and her lover are happy and content, basking in family approval, at the same time.I applaud the film makers for not turning the husband into a Hindi film staple-- the evil husband who we all love to hate. Instead, we empathised with him, and sympathised with him.But in the end, this movie won the day with it's simplicity-- no violence, no jhatkas, just good old fashioned story telling.....it's not a film for everyone, indeed as we were leaving the cinema, some people behind us were heard to say "what a boring movie". Don't watch it if you're expecting another "Main hoon na".Watch it if you love movies that involve you rather than batter the senses." 
" Paheli-Interesting like a puzzle","We always talk about the great Indian treasure we have in the form of literature but when it comes to adapting them for films for mass consumption, everybody for some strange reason adopted a ridiculous view that this cannot be commercially viable proposition. Paheli, here not only comes as a whiff of fresh air by being original but also as a tight slap on the face of all such advocates of escapist, masala cinema. Also its not an easy cake-walk for those "Hollywood (now even other world cinema) DVDs-inspired fools". Three cheers to Shahrukh for he took a great leap by lending his hands to this film by not just acting in it but also producing it. (Never mind if he is competing with fellow actor Aamir who produced "Lagaan'). Based on book by Vijay Dan Detha, (it was adapted way back in 1973 by Director Mani Kaul for his film-Duvidha) it has captured everything with grandeur. Is it superfluous or sumptuous? May be to an extent but definitely it did not look like a patch as in cases of our Devdases and Blacks. The mind blowing Art Direction (Munish Sappel), Exotic Locations, Costumes (Shalini Sarna), Jewellery (Tanishq), everything falls seamlessly into place. Cinematography (Ravi K. Chandran) and Visual Efx (Eagle Video Films-Prime Focus) is first rate. The sequence where a ghost morphs into a Crow and then to a Squirrel, followed by a bird and finally a Man is mesmerizing. Rani Mukherji and Mr. Bachchan (in Cameo) are competent as usual. Amol Palekar, the director always delivers, never disappoints and same is the case here in his Ninth Film To top it not only he crafted an aesthetic, wonderful fairy-tale looking folklore but also manages his lead actor to perform wisely within the periphery of character, without going over the top. Look at the different number of expressions Shahrukh has given every time while mumbling same line-"Phal..Phool Gulabjal". No doubt a rare achievement. . It has some minus points too; the camel race is not shot well. May be it is difficult to capture and is also redundant. Sequence could have been shorter. Rajpal Yadav's Character is completely unnecessary and could have been avoided. Also can somebody please tell him not to play to the gallery for 'N'th time? Sub plot of Juhi Chawla and Suneil Shetty also has nothing to contribute to the narrative. Songs are too many and mostly out of situation. Also the drama quotient in climax is low, it could have been treated with more impact. Narrative of whole film would be more interesting if they played on subtle humor throughout the film. Nevertheless, all these come across as minor flaws. A word of advice for Shahrukh, stick to such cinema rather than doing those mindless NRI romances, as you will gradually find a rather larger audience never mind if it takes another 2-3 attempts. All in all, in one word the whole viewing experience can be described as "Phenomenal"." 
" Art at its best !","I watched Palekar's "Paheli" today. I respect Palekar as a director - this happened right after I watched his "Thooda Sa Roomani Ho Jaaye" starring Nana Patekar. He has made few movies, but each one of them has been critically acclaimed.I will add "Paheli" to that list. But the treatment here is slightly different and this is not a "typical" "art" film. This is largely due to the producer being Shahrukh and also most of the cast and crew being from mainstream Hindi cinema.I felt "Paheli" was a perfect film. Take any aspect of it - direction, acting, dialogues and dialogue delivery (keeping in mind that it is set a long time back in the past and also the heavy regional accent), lyrics and music and to a large extent art direction and cinematography (this film is going to win a LOT of awards, believe me :) and deservedly so !). I couldn't find a flaw for the entire length of the movie. A special mention must be made of the high quality special effects, which are an integral part of the narrative.Shahrukh has often been criticized of being a poor actor with a limited range. I think he has taken upon himself to prove his detractors wrong - "Swades" and now "Paheli" will convince any SRK-hater that the man does have it in him to portray different kinds of people.In conclusion, "Paheli" is a must watch. Its about the triumph of love against all odds. And it is probably the best filmed love story I've seen in a long time !" 
" Beautiful fairytale!","The movie showcasing the mystic charm of Rajasthan's landscapes (fab cinematography), it's traditional people and splendid performance by the leading cast Shahrukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee is irresistible. Aditi Govitrikar, the pretty model who makes an initial appearance is gorgeous. Juhi Chawla has a tiny role too, anyway she looks beautiful and leaves many male hearts sighing! Suniel Shetty disappears before we can spell P-A-H-E-L-I! Anupam Kher and Rajpal Yadav's comedy adds to the beauty of the movie. Amitabh Bachchan, in a guest appearance as the maverick shepherd makes a cool impact as usual. However, I'm unable to understand the climax. I guess it's upon the viewers to interpret the end. Be entertained, the magic days are back in Bollywood!" 
" You might as well watch it for the Shah Rukh/Rani chemistry","I came to see Pehali just to see two of my favourite actors displaying their wonderful talents on the screen. At the same token, i wished that the slightly strange storyline wouldn't falter anywhere. It didn't, but really, the film wasn't as good as it looked.The story is different no doubt, but there wasn't any serious core to it naturally (its about the 'eternal love story' of a ghost!). This kind of prevented me from taking the film seriously.However, a very nice set design and simply superb colours made the film not entirely a joke.The cast, as expected, was superb. Shah Rukh brought his unique and mature attitude to the screen once again and Rani just looked amazing. Anupum Kher was also excellent and performed the most subtle comic role i have ever seen in Hindi cinema. This was really what made the film enjoyable. The special appearances were also much appreciated; Juhi making a now rare appearance in mainstream films! The music is great, and Shah Rukh is successful in bringing another cinematic surprise to the silver screen. All in all, the film is fun to watch, although I feel 'Parineeta' was much better. But finally, Hindi films are starting to feel more original!" 
" What happened in the end?","Well for this movie, a good place to begin is the end. I don't want to be a spoiler, but seriously what happened in the end. I have never seen such a hash of a climax like the one that I saw here (And thats entirely the reason for the below average rating). Surely, Vijayadan Detha's novel, Duvidha, on which this movie is based could not have had such an abrupt ending and even if it did I am sure that there would have been a lot more finesse and emotion attached then the one that we got to saw in this movie.But now the good parts. The beautiful Rajasthani culture is brought to light in this wonderful saga about relations and the yearning for a husband by his wife. The colour and dresses in the initial song sequence as Lachchi (Rani Mukherjee) gets married to a trader husband, Kishan (Shahrukh Khan) are quite spell-binding and true to the form and culture of Rajasthan. The seamless deserts, the well-decorated banyan tree bring to life the people and lore of Rajasthan as we know it. The Rajashtani haveli, the bania mindset and the rainbow bangles intermingle beautifully in this melancholy of songs and dance. But I must warn you that songs it is that this movie has too many off. At times I felt it could fill up two whole cassettes!However, lets get back to the story. Lachchi and her husband Kishan on the way back from their marriage halt for lunch at a rest house which has a very old banyan tree and is supposed to have more than a hundred ghosts. It is here that Lachchi meets various incarnations of the ghost, whom she will come to love very soon. As they return home, Lachchi is devastated to learn that her merchant husband will be leaving her the next day, only to return five years hence much like his elder brother who went away seven years ago and never came back. As she watches him leave the next morning, the yearning for a husband and love is all too visible in her eyes. Along comes the ghost who transforms himself to look like her husband but also reveals himself to her. It is at this very precarious moment that Lachchi must decide whether she will wait for a husband, who like his elder brother, might never return or learn to love this man who will show her the endless joys of life. It is no small wonder that she chooses the latter and what follows thereafter is miracle after miracle as he not only wins her heart but also makes her his very own. The story then moves through various small incidents as he proves her love again and again to her and their family. Things take a turn when Lachchi turn pregnant and it is time for the ghost to reevaluate his role in the scheme of things. At this point he realizes how true his love for Lachchi is, and how unwilling he is to let go of her. It is at this time that the original Kishan returns home and has to now prove that he is the real Kishan and not the ghost who has been haunting their house since the past 2 years.The portrayal of Lachchi and Kishan are quite unforgettable by these two very talented actors. Who else to better fit the role of the bania father than Anupam Kher, a role he played to perfection long ago in the Aamir Khan-Madhuri Dixit starrer, Dil. Rajpal Yadav as a comedian is here to stay and it would not be very wrong to say that some of the most entertaining moments in the film were provided by him. Its probably a story of the times that a gorgeous well-talented actress like Juhi Chawla has to play the bit role of Lachchi's bhabhi. Sunil "Suneil" Shetty disappears faster than a ghost with his role as Juhi's husband and we shall never really know the purpose of these two otherwise talented actors in such small roles. Amitabh Bachchan is in that unique place in his career where roles are being made for him. Though it might have anyway been in the original script, his personification as the shepherd who solves the "Paheli" will not be forgotten soon. Naseruddin Shah as the voice behind the puppet makes a forceful presence.All in all, at the end, the movie leaves you with a lost feeling. The story really does'nt move anywhere in the middle in the time between the ghost arrives and the real Kishan returns. The two hours in between is just a combination of songs, more colour and dances and piecemeal sequences which I am sure do no justice to Vijayadan Detha's novel. One wishes the story could have dealt more deeply with human relationships, about the feelings of a woman torn from her household of 20 years to be brought into a new place only to be left behind by a man she might never see. The actors gave it their all but one would have to place the blame at the door of the director for treating us to this sorely mediocre score in which so much more was possible. But the heartening thing for me from this movie is the trend that I believe we shall see more often. Much like Hollywood, we shall see more movies based on books which would mean a stronger story line (hopefully), well-sketched protagonists and though-provoking emotions. And when you have a starry cast backed by astute marketing in such an artsy movie, you are bound to pull in the crowds, at least in the opening weekend." 
" Paheli was too short","I just saw Paheli yesterday and I loved it. I was a little worried when I read what it was about, but I think that it was handled really well, at least for Bollywood. It is half typical Bollywood and half something else. The final dance sequence is the cutest thing ever and all of the music is great! Seeing Shahrukh with the mustache was just something that I couldn't get used to, but he was adorable anyway. The ending is not typical Bollywood at all and I am not sure that I liked it. The special effects are very typical of Bollywood but they don't really affect the movie very much and they are relatively short so I didn't mind them. I guess that Bollywood is just not used to having shorter films because there were a couple spots that needed more character development. Overall I rate it very high, definitely worth the $10 to go see it." 
" very good","This review might include a spoiler, although I will try not to write anything beneath my opinion, that has not been said in the film description. I have just seen Paheli and I think it was very good. The movie is set in a time in India, where girls weren't ask whether they wanted to marry or not. They were not allowed to make any decisions on their own. Lachchi's goodlooking, but mind-weak husband leaves her after one night because his father wants him to. Lachchi is facing 5 years of loneliness. The only possible man she can have, without anyone suspecting anything, is of course a ghost that can take the form of her husband. This Lovestory is very moving and well-made. The songs are OK. SRK and Rani are a very good pair, and the much-discussed Mouch of SRK doesn't hurt as much as we thought. Also the ghost is up to some mischief which is very funny. A must see in my opinion!" 
" A most beautiful movie","This is the most beautiful Hindi movie I have seen so far. Of course, I would still prefer Veer-Zaara and Devdas plot-wise, but the scenery in this film is simply breathtaking. The director does an excellent job in capturing all the picturesque sceneries from all the most suitable angles. The utilisation of the architecture and the colorfulness of the costumes complement the cinematography greatly. This film is not just about a grand visual experience. The romance theme in it is very commendable as well - the condemnation of "loveless" marriage and the lauding of true love however difficult to attain. Although surreal, this show is unlike The Lake House, where you would feel a little unacceptable after watching because of its time factor separating Reeves and Bullock, and the love between the 2 not able to project an effect of realness. Paheli is a dream, yet it is so real, or rather, so many of us hope it would happen to us so much." 
" A Fairy Tale seductively re-told.","Paheli is a rare film.Its beautifully mounted and photographed with amazing backgrounds and costumes - totally suited to the traditional tale. For me it re-created my sub continental childhood when we were brought up on stories of princesses and Djinns in fantasy palaces-romantic and emotionally satisfying. Some people have criticised the film as being too slow and incredible. Of course it is incredible because it is a fairy tale. But once the imaginative leap has been made and its premise accepted, the film is pure delight.Shah Rukh Khan in his double role as the accountant to the core husband and the romantic spirit, is charismatic and romantic and riveting. Rani is the perfect beautiful bride, fully integrated into the world in which she lives so much so that she is completely thrown when the surrogate husband gives her the choice of keeping or rejecting him. So its a woman's rights film as well! But I just loved it on its own terms- a beautifully performed, beautifully produced, unusual film for our delectation."
