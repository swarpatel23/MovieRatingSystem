" Surprisingly Better Than Expected","Before watching De Taali, I had absolutely expected the movie to be another lame one-liner comedy that would compare to the likes of flops such as Tom, Dick & Harry, and Krazzy 4, etc. However, what I received was something totally different.The first 25 minutes or so of the movie drags poorly, presenting an overly optimistic and naive (and not to mention hackneyed & clich√©d) view of the close friendship between the three main characters. This 25 minutes spell is also the driest of all comic events that occur throughout the movie. However, if you can get past this part, you are certainly in for a treat.The movie only picks up after the poor start. The jokes get continuously better and funnier, and the situational comedy simply cannot be ignored. Some scenes are a pure laugh riot to those who enjoy clever and well-scripted comedy (as opposed to silly banter that most comedy movies these days are now filled with).The story ties up nicely, though I have to say that the portrayal of the ending could have been a little better. There is nothing wrong with the conclusion reached, but rather the way they approached it following the climax. Of course, the story was somewhat predictable, but the director still managed to keep it fresh.Acting was great as well. Some actors excelled, while others ranked merely above the line of mediocrity. For instance, Hritesh was excellent in his comic role. He truly has a knack for comedy. Ayesha, as always, portrays a sweet and innocent attitude such convincingly that you can't help but to be impressed by her. Rimi Sen, played her seductive role incredibly well, and keep note of her witty use of subtle facial expressions throughout the movie. Aftab didn't really stick out, but then again, his role was the most standard of all of them, and was also severely limited in the number of comic lines he spoke.All in All, the movie was highly enjoyable, so long as you don't focus on the few flaws. Of course, the movie isn't perfect, there are many things that could have been done better, cinematography and editing-wise that would have improved the movie, but it still served as a great Time pass, at the least. In conclusion, A Unique movie with a not so unique story." 
" A good film after a long while","I went to the theater with my friends to watch this movie. After a long dry season in bollywood i didn't have much expectation with this movie, but to my surprise it was not a 90min pop corn junk. Its is very good movie revolving around three friends "Ammu played by Ayesha takhia, Paglu played by Hritesh Deshmukh and Abhi by Abtabh. The movie is wonderfully scripted with a spice of comedy and fun. The story gets twisted when Abhi son of rich guy falls in love with a girl who loves him for his money. The story all about how his friends helps him to get rid of that girl.Throughout the movie there was no dry seen or a part where i felt bored but yes there were some song sequence which i felt was unnecessary. Over all the movie is very enjoyable and funny. Do watch and enjoy the movie. cheers friends." 
" Funny in parts but crap","E- Niwas made nice comedies like LKLKBK(2001) He dons the hat once again in DE TAALI but it's so bizarre that you wanna say DE GAALIThe movie is funny in parts like the kidnapping scenes, even Rimii's character is well handled The games played by Ritiesh and Ayesha are funny But the entire Saurabh SHukla part is bizarre even the last scenes are a put offDirection by E-Niwas is decent in parts, crap in parts Music is okay, but some songs like Maari teetri are forcedAmongst actors Ritiesh gets more natural with every film and he excels here too, providing laughter in abundance Ayesha too is tolerable here Rimii too does her part very well but her laugh part seems forced Aftab is alright in his part Amongst rest Anupam kher has no big role Saurabh Shukla is nothing great" 
" remake of saving Silverman 2001","well its not a new thing is Bellwood that makes exact replica of Hollywood movies. this movie is remake of "Saving Silverman (2001)". with same theme but with some Bellwood mas-ala.the movie is quiet nice but at some instance we realize that there is no need stretch a story more than this. but if you are audience which don't use your brain while enjoying a movie then go for it. but i will prefer watch original version. original movie cast is Steve Zahn ... Wayne Jack Black ... J.D. Jason Biggs ... Darren Amanda Peet ... Judith i am a fan of jack black and saving Silverman is one of the best in his career i gave it 6/10 cause some nice comedy scenes and music. rite sh has done very well job in the movie and according to me he is suitable for this kinds of comedies. ayes ha looks so cute and Aftab is very wellalso we can expect another sequel." 
" Wonderful!","This movie deserves something more than 10 out of 10 because it had everything a movie requires to be a Hit on the box office but the strange thing was that the movie failed on the box office even after getting a great response by many people. The main good thing was the story which was never dragged, it went smoothly throughout except for close to the ending the movie got a little confused. The second good thing was the DIALOGUES of the movie which were really funny at times (Especially The NAHATA part)the beat scene was when he gave the girl the torture by showing her RAM GOPAL VARMA KI AAG!. The next great thing was the acting by each and every one in the film. The worst thing that happened was that people didn't really go watch it as the cast wasn't that big, but believe me, lots of people will surely watch it on DVD! a great movie by all aspects, hats off to the director and the writer (I HAVE NO IDEA WHO HE WAS?)" 
" Above-Average!","Heavily inspired by the Hollywood flop Saving Silverman, 'De Taali' is an Above-Average fare, that isn't entirely a waste of time. Its, at best, a passable film, with some really good performances! 'De Taali' revolves around three childhood friends, whose lives change after a girl enters their lives with questionable reasons. 'De Taali' has a pleasant first-hour, with the camaraderie between its protagonists, played by Aftab Shivdasani, Ayesha Takia & Ritesh Deshmukh, clicking well. Things take a u-turn when Rimi Sen's character enters. The entire kidnapping episode is strictly average. Also, the true identity of Rimi's character, lacks the fizz. Overall, a nicely shaped first-hour gets over-shadowed by a rather disappointing second-hour.The Screenplay offers a few enjoyable moments, but the second-hour doesn't convince in totality. E. Nivas's Direction lacks sharpness. Cinematography is alright. Ditto for the Editing. Music by Vishal-Shekhar is energetic.Performance-Wise: Ritesh Deshmukh is up for vie top honors. The versatile actor pitches in a credible, comedic performance, that leads the film. Aftab Shivadasani, too, delivers wonderfully. Ayesha Takia is cute. Rimi Sen is in excellent form. She enacts the mysterious part with great confidence. However, supremely talented actors such as Anupam Kher, Saurabh Shukla, Pawan Malhotra & Mukul Dev, are wasted in ill-defined roles.On the whole, 'De Taali' is a reasonably entertaining film."
