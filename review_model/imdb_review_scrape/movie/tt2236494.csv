" best movie on mulniwasi people","This is nice movie. is any award given to director" 
" How the lower caste people in India lived in historical times.","A historical movie distorting history is not acceptable. The movie claims the caste system to be prevalent worldwide. The director has confused racism with cast ism. Cast ism, as created by cunning "Brahmins" is worst form of social system denying education, freedom of choosing employment, financial independence, expression of thoughts, dignity and self esteem to the people born in caste treated as lower. This aspect has been shown accurately. A film touching such an inflamed topic is expected to convey a social message. The title of the movie substantiated this expectation. But the director abruptly ended the movie after showing massacre of helpless people. "The rising" part of their struggle was censured, I guess. Dr Ambedkar, who relentlessly fought for the "shudras", was shown as compatriot of the people who perpetuated this caste system even after India's independence." 
" Story of revenge by so called upper class landlord who brutally massacres entire shudra village","Excellent artwork and promotional song. Beyond this the movie does no justice to the title "Shudra-the rising". In fact the movie is deceptive and antipathetic to the title. What I inferred from the title was that the movie would show the struggle which "shudras" (aboriginals enslaved and subjugated by the aryan race invaders) have been undergoing (in past as well as in 65 years of independent India) to attain emancipation, education, equality and dignity. The movie instead shows how foreign invaders despised, abused and degenerated them portraying demoralizing, distasteful picture. Debauchery, moral corruption and shrewdness of the upper class was trivialized. Climax was abrupt. End documentary was like microscopic warning on cigarette pack. Entire movie runs for about 120 minutes. It seems the movie sustained severe censure. Three stars only for acting and locations."
