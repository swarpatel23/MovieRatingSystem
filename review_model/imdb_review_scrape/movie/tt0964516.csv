" Good concept and steady execution, though flawed and one-sided depiction","Madhur Bhandarkar is known for his realistic, dramatic, often shocking and often women-oriented films. He always takes a medium and decides to portray it in a film which will expose the reality behind it. This time he chose to depict the world of fashion in a film called... well, Fashion. And yes, it's an interesting, well-made film that works for the audience. However, it has one main problem: It is stereotypical and overly pessimistic to be called totally realistic, and in that aspect falls flat. I don't say Bhandarkar's previous works were any different or were particularly optimistic as his films generally present the dark side of his subjects, but this one goes one step down. We learn from the film that everything, sorry, EVERYTHING is bad in the world of Fashion - it is a terrible world of sex (not that it's bad, but this movie is all about infidelity and one-night stands), alcohol, drugs, grief and loneliness. There's nothing good about it - and it is clearly a wrong depiction - it's not reality. If you want to make an issue-based film, you should present both sides, and this is not done here. It is also mostly stereotypical in its general portrayal of gay men, which is amusingly exaggerated. Above all, Priyanka's character in the first portions of the film is annoying. She is not presented as a girl who is just innocent, she is presented as a complete idiot which is odd for someone who wants to enter the world of fashion and says she wants to be a "supermodel". I don't think a girl who wants to be a supermodel can be that shy. Some other flaws include the sudden way the director shows the girl smoking and drinking without any prior indication to it (starting to smoke is not just about lighting a cigarette, is it?). This transformation was far too quick to be believable.Anyway, what I did like about the film is its well-invested execution and good film-making from the technical point of view. Other than the problems mentioned above, the script is decent, the dialogues are well-written, the drama is not overdone, the film is well-directed, and at the end of it all, the ending provides a well-deserved sigh of relief, although it's not completely positive. Not less important, it is visually impressive, the music is outstanding ("Maar Jaawan" and "Kuch Khaas Hai" are two of my favourite Hindi songs in recent times), the cinematography is great, the costumes are well chosen and designed, the actors are well-cast, and the entire concept of following one model's way to the top, her rise and her fall, is interesting. Priyanka Chopra is good and impressive. One of her best, though considering her body of work it does not really mean much as of now. She acted with aplomb and looked very attractive which is very important in that kind of a role. The real winner, the real show-stealer, however, is Kangana Ranaut who delivers a knock-out performance. Her confidence, hysterics, good looks, arrogance and confusion are superbly acted. This is not the first time she plays psychologically disturbed girls, but she is just too brilliant at it, so I salute it. This is an exceptional intense portrayal. 'Fashion' may show only one side throughout and may be a bit disturbing at some points, but towards the end it shows a brighter, more optimistic side, which was missing during the entire show and is reasonably worth the wait. Prepare yourself for an interesting and entertaining flick about a girl who tries to make her dream come true, but don't expect to see a knowledgeable and correct depiction of the fashion world." 
" Priyanka shines in this wonderful film!!!","I watched this movie simply because of the good hype surrounding it. Although it was def. not my type (modeling does not interest me at all). Believe me, anyone would like this film!Wow. I always thought Priyanka's acting was horrible. Come on after Salaam e ishq I was really wondering who would hire this girl... but maybe its just because she's been in these comedy/sexy roles and not a very complex character. Well guys her performance in Fashion was incredible. She def. deserved the IIFA best actress award over Aish in Jodha Akbar!That being said this is a very gritty portrayal of the fashion world that whether it is a realistic depiction or not is very interesting. It takes you into an 'alternate universe' in India and fills you in on all the gritty details and all the central characters that by the end you feel like you have journeyed with Meghna (Priyanka's character) all the way and seen it all yourself.Well all of that being said you are in for a real treat with Fashion. It is no typical masala film as I'm sure you know but go in with an open mind and you will come out feeling like you have really seen something memorable!" 
" A Nutshell Review: Fashion","The glamorous world of fashion gets put under the spotlight with Madhur Bhandarakar's Fashion, a story which tells of the rise and fall of a fictional Indian supermodel Meghna Mathur, played by ex Miss World Priyanka Chopra, who holds court with her performance as the phoenix finding her own standing in an industry known for ruthlessness and fickleness that comes with changing its representative face with the seasons.As Meghna, Chopra brings to life the wide-eyed small town girl who dreams of making it big on the catwalks of Mumbai, and thereafter the world, and we journey with her through this long and arduous road to modelling. Given that a typical Bollywood movie comes in two parts after an intermission, each part serves its intent well, acting as a separation of attitudes adopted, of the transformation of Meghna from aspiring model, to one at her peak, bad attitude notwithstanding.You'd come to expect a story that's almost mirroring that of The Devil Wears Prada, where good natured girl gets caught up with all the bright lights and glamour, that she loses her humanity quite consciously, looking at herself change from angel to demon, yet powerless in the grip of fame and money to find the moral courage to do anything about it. It tells of pitfalls, not only in this particular industry, but in general the kind of negative person we are susceptible to turn into, should we lose touch with reality, and let success get into our heads.Priyanka Chopra is quite perfect in the role and believable both as the girl next door, and a supermodel as well, given her beautiful looks and height to carry the role of a clothes horse. She brings to the screen some steely resolve in that it's not enough to be just a part of the industry, but to be #1 through any methods and means. During production of course there was talk about her going on a crash diet for her role, and I guess such rumours get spun because the industry favours pencil thin (read: unhealthy looking) models who grace the catwalks. However, Chopra brings about a healthy glow to her role as Meghna, though I thought toward the end she looked a little more svelte in her figure than to begin with.It's good to see that at least she's not quite obsessed into being yet another waif looking character, as there might be some pressure given the production did feature real models, some even from Elite, gracing the screen as background eye candy. And this film was really quite encompassing with its portrayal of the industry, what with all the power players from agents to agencies, from designers (including fashion labels like Jimmy Choo) to magazines (Vogue India), from genuine friends to those looking to feel up skirts. I particularly liked how the film introduced us to all the key players and characters in one fell swoop, and what more through a fashion show, listening in to who's who and rivalries that exist, before observing just how hypocritical everyone can be toward one another.Granted there were some lapses into character stereotypes like the gay designer and the married modelling agency boss (played by Arbaaz Khan) who has no qualms about sleeping with his top model, and with some moments in the plot being quite predictable, especially with relationships both personal and professional, Fashion still comes through unscathed as it's delivered in a slick package, sashaying to the cool seductive moves of catwalk modelling, of showing off its best side to the audience.Since this is a film from Bollywood, you can expect many sleazy bits to be toned down and self-censored, with one scene involving a wardrobe malfunction actually being mosaic-ed off. And besides Priyanka Chopra, Mugdha Godse also held her own as Meghna's best friend Janet, who shows her the ropes and also bearing witness to her meteoric rise and fall. But I thought Kangna Ranaut's show-stopper role as top supermodel Shonali was something to sit up and take notice, with her pitch-perfect arrogance on the catwalk being quite a sight to behold, and her character being a parallel to that of Meghna, as a pre-cursor and warning of what one's life would be if you'd throw it to the wind, given her indulgence in drugs, drink, smoke and a choice of the wrong partner.I haven't seen a lot of movies about the fashion industry, but I suppose this one form India serves as a catalyst to begin, even if it's a work of fiction. Eye candy galore and a simple storyline to follow, it's houte couture on display, everything good and nasty about it. As close to front row seats to a fashion show I can get." 
" The depth of fashion","Fashion was a really nice movie, and mostly it was it was showing the life of models. It even shows the models dark side, not only smoking, drinking etc. Priyanka Chopra did a very good acting as Meghna Mathur. But I felt that if she could have given a bit more expressions it would have been a better film. Kangana Raunat did a satisfying role as Shonali Gujral. She was into her character. Specially then when she had to act drunken etc. I guess she was the one who acted the best in this movie. But I still think the movie could be made shorter. She really showed how ambitious she was. Priyanka really showed how nicely she could act and do cat walk. I think Madhur Bhandarkar has made a really successful and real life based movie. His movie has a depth and shows the real life of models. You all should go and see this incredible movie." 
" A realistic film.","Bollywood movie industry has started making realistic films. This movie explores the world of fashion and all those who wish to be model won't get inspired after watching this film. "In the world of fashion you have to compromise more than just your morals." Models here are alcoholics and drug addicts.Meghna Mathur (Priyanka Chopra) is a small town middle class girl who wants to be a model, especially after winning a beauty contest. After many procedures she becomes one and many problems starts to occur.Movie is directed well with lots of effort from the cast and the crew. Costumes are all nice showing the present day fashion. Priyanka Chopra surprisingly delivered a good performance. She has taken a lot of effort for role. Kangna Ranaut's role was more challenging and she pulled it off easily. The newcomer Mugda Godse also did her part well.The songs are good and the background score is excellent. The title music of fashion is stupendous. Overall it is a good movie especially towards the end. The last one hour is the best in this film.7/10" 
" The most glamorous film of the year","Madhur Bhandar the director has shown the dark side of celebrities in Page 3, business in Corporate and now he is showing us the dark side of models in fashion.The movie is really good that has a very interesting story based on a real life model played by Priyanka Chopra as Meghna Mathur. It shows the life of models when they are not on a catwalk wearing make-up, lipstick, nail polish and wearing glamorous dresses. But it was also very stylish, visually impressive and doesn't just show the dark side because fashion is a great thing as well. Fashion has a very important message that we can all learn from especially the girls and young women who intend to be a model. The film may seem that it will only appeal to the female audience but the story is so good that it's also good for male. Priyanka Chopra may have delivered six flops in a row but it was still her best performance of the year.The story is about Meghna Mathur who is a small town girl with a dream and the determination, she knew in her bones that she was meant to be famous. The world of fashion - the clothes, the colours, the make-up... all of these form a part of a fascinating world that Meghna longed to be a part of and she would do anything to reach the top. She reaches the peak of her success and rises to walk the ramps for leading designers across India. However karma catches up with Meghna as she slowly starts to pay the price for her fame and her journey to the top but her attempt at a comeback was going to be a near impossibility. Basically it is a journey of the rise and fall.Whether it's an original film or the music that has killer tunes, film director Madhur Bhandar always has the ability to surprise you. The music for Fashion is no different. Heavy beats combine well with powerful melodies on solid songs. The pick of the great songs are Fashion Ka Jalwa and the superb Mar Jaawa.Overall it was such a good film and I would recommend it to those who want a different story but not to those who don't like people talking throughout the whole film." 
" The Big Bad World Of Fashion = Hell?","With 'Fashion' Bhandarkar, quite obviously, takes us to the world of fashion. The storytelling falls on the same line as his previous films like 'Corporate', 'Page 3' and 'Chandni Bar'. In a way this is a strength and weakness. The good thing about it is that it shows a darker side of the fashion industry, though Bhandarkar does not go as extreme like he did in 'Page 3'. The problem with his portrayal is that there is no good side. The fashion industry is portrayed as hell. Clearly it couldn't be that bad for every model. I'm not saying that Bhandarkar needs to balance both the good and the bad in his film (as his focus is on the negative) but a glimpse of the positive would have been interesting. Bhandarkar's own 'Satta' is an example (and I believe it is his best film to date).What is it that attracts people about becoming a part of the fashion industry? Is it just the glitter and glamour? What is it that attracts Meghna to become a supermodel? These are things I would have liked to see in the film but Bhandarkar pretty much follows the 'small-town girl enters hell' routine. This was also the same problem with 'Page 3' (where all the rich and wealthy are portrayed as bad), 'Corporate' (ditto) and 'Chandni Bar' (society is bad). What Bhandarkar does is simply throw the negative in the audience's face and let the 'heroine' suffer.Moreover, Bhandarkar infuses some deja-vu and clichéd plots such as Meghna getting pregnant (a la Tara Sharma in 'Page 3'). The homosexual characters are stereotypically portrayed (with the exception of Samir Soni's character). Perhaps a more satirical approach could have made this a better film. Where editing is concerned, there are too many walk-on-the ramp scenes. Alright so it's a movie about fashion so that is expected but overdoing commercial isn't necessary (though it is not as bad as 'The Devil Wears Prada') Yet, 'Fashion' isn't all that bad. It does make one aware of the kind of darkness that taints the industry. The storytelling is compelling in parts as I liked the idea of showing the rise of one model leading to another's fall from grace.The performances are good. It's been a long while since Priyanka Chopra's been in a role of substance and she does a good job of carrying the film. Mughda Godse makes a confident debut and definitely does a fine job. Kangana Ranaut is a little too loud and is clearly getting typecast as the damsel in distress. Samir Soni too does a fine job and Ashwin Mushran performs adequate as Meghna's supporter. Kitu Gidwani and Arjan Bajwa make their presence felt and Arbaaz Khan is sufficient.Overall, 'Fashion' is certainly no bad watch. I like that Bhandarkar attempts different kinds of films and the risky subject matters that scare away other filmmakers. There may be a little pretension and one-sidedness but in the end it's the story of an individual trying to make it and then losing herself in an albeit exaggerated biased ruthless bad world." 
" A good movie yet again from Madhur Bhandarkar","Madhur Bhandarkar is known for revealing the stark truths of various facets of the Indian society. And this definitely doesn't change with Fashion as well. A well told story of a small town girl with big aspirations, who loses herself to the devouring fashion industry only to re discover herself at the end of it all. Your routine run of the mill story? Not quite. Madhur has picked up important events in India's fashion industry (wardrobe malfunction, the demented model found in the markets etc.) and shown what all models go through. The identities of various designers, how the industry REALLY works and how a fashion career is to be perceived are very well told. The music is awesome, and the ramp scenes are truly genius.The downside? the movie is too long, could be cut short by half an hour at least. Priyanka Chopra doesn't always look as glamorous as she should, but Kangana Ranaut justifies her role completely and pulls of a good show. All in all, definitely not to miss, what with the lean bollywood season going on, fashion is definitely a'show stopper'" 
" Watchable but not as hard-edged as expected","'Fashion' is consistently entertaining if not as hard-edged as Madhur Bhandarkar's earlier films. It's basically a star vehicle for Priyanka Chopra, who does well as a supermodel who makes an unlikely comeback. The film lacks inside information on the fashion industry and mostly restricts itself to catty remarks about designers stealing ideas. Most of the film deals with Priyankas's journey through the fashion world. Kangna Ranaut excels in her role as the reigning 'show-stopper' despite her awkward dialog delivery. The film does go on too long but remains watchable.Overall 7/10" 
" Classic Bhandarkar Fare","Ramp walks, arrogant supermodels, conniving modeling agency heads, wardrobe malfunctions, and delusional ex models on the street - expectedly it's all there in Madhur Bhandarkar's take on the fashion industry, 'Fashion'. It is a hard hitting look alright, but being a first of its kind perspective as far as Bollywood is concerned, it does get away with a few inconsistencies. In trying to bridge the chasm between perception and reality about the glam world of modeling through the story of the rise and fall of aspiring model Meghna Mathur (Priyanka Chopra) the film does stand out thanks to its well crafted fashion show sequences, intense performances and a nice dose of self deprecating gags (Bhandarkar even plays himself in a cameo!). But where it lacks is that after not taking itself too seriously early on, the second half is a little too intense a tad too long. Priyanka Chopra deserves special mention for easing into the metamorphic role from aspirant to the supermodel who then goes on to lose her modeling mojo. The other two models, Shonali (Kangana Ranaut is pretty tolerable in a slightly uni-dimensional role) and Janet (Mugdha Godse seems comfortable) hold their own as well. Even the support roles (Ashwin Mushran as the very gay Rohit Khanna looks suspiciously familiar to Stanley Tucci's character from 'The Devil Wears Prada' while Kitu Gidwani puts in a quietly confident role as Anisha Roy) are well executed though they are a bit on the caricaturish side. Bhandarkar packs every news-bite possible about the fashion industry into the script which tends to lose focus in the latter half. But as is his wont he does manage to touch a few chords and at least agitate the viewer's mind. In short, as far as the invite to this 'Fashion' show goes, come for Madhur Bhandarkar and stay for Priyanka Chopra!" 
" Bhandarkar delivers again! Priyanka Chopra is a real showstopper!","After making his mark with realistic flicks like Chandni Bar, Page-3, Corporate and Traffic Signal which portrayed the underbelly of dance bars, high society, boardrooms and the streets respectively, Bhandarkar has repeated his realism feat, this time with the glittery world of fashion. With scenes inspired by real life events, a la Carol Gracias’ wardrobe malfunction and Gitanjali Nagpal’s sad fate, Fashion is a worthy film.Following her idol supermodel Shonali (Kangana), Megha (Chopra) arrives in Mumbai from Chandigarh to make it big in modeling. Her confidence soon gives her too much success too soon when she loses herself and hits downturn. By then, Shonali is already down into drugs and begging on streets. And there is a struggling model and free spirit Janet (Mugdha). The following drama is about Meghna pulling her life together.Going by his earlier flicks, Madhur Bhandarkar portrays strange relationships again; with gay designers, model coordinators playing the contract muddle, changing attitudes with changing fortunes, power abuse by a leading design house, accusations of stealing designs and lecherous socialites amongst others. Fashion’s biggest enemy, as is with realistic flicks is its predictability giving you a feeling as if you knew the story fully! Talk of showstoppers and Priyanka Chopra has delivered her career best in a character that transitions from a sweet small town girl to a trample-all bitch to someone desolately lost to rediscovering herself back again. Complimenting the performance are the five distinct looks by stylist Rita Dhody. If at all it doesn’t lift her sagging box office fortunes, this one-time Filmfare winner has just inched closer to a possible second.Kangana has successfully portrayed a psychopath again; the girl seems to have carved a niche for herself. Yet, her dialog and diction are as poor as ever. Mugdha Godse is a revelation for a first timer. Samir Soni and Ashwin Mushran shine as the gay designers and benefactors of the protagonist. Chak-de girl Chitrashi Rawat too makes a mark in a small role. Music is reasonable with the score feeling too repetitive towards the end.Timing it to perfection as the Deepawali release, the audience are steadily flocking the screens. But as you near the end of the 150 minute run time, replete with overused terms like ‘show-stopper’ et al, you can sense the restlessness of the audience. In the end, barring a few clichés, it leaves with a sense that you got your money’s worth. But you are left wondering why in the censor’s wisdom was this certified an adult movie!" 
" Fashion: Makes a strong show and statement!!","Dazzling beauties, scintillating faces and an unprecedented dark shadows of backlashes: backstage of the glamour world is grossly scaring and unbelievably haunting. Madhur Bhandarkar's next real life reel movie although not in the same league of his previous works but yet makes a strong mark on the mind of viewers. The wow of the movie is the way fashion shows have been presented, remarkable camera work to capture the zest of the glam, astonishing sets and most importantly sizzling Kangana and Priyanka on the ramp. Kangana surely played a real showstopper in the movie; her confidence on the ramp would definitely give complex to seasoned models and even super models. The story is about rise & fall of an aspiring chandigarh model Meghana played by Priyanka who wants to burn the ramp with her aura and set the stage on fire with her presence. Her confidence and dynamic attitude makes her in the wish list of all the top brands and she acclaims supermodel status from veteran model Shonali played brilliantly by Kangana. I although have not seen much of live fashion shows but had my share of watching and I could definitely rate both of them on the acme of the act they have incorporated for Fashion. Kangana appeals me more than Priyanka as she definitely stands tall when it comes to the flair and attitude on the ramp than anyone else in the movie. She steals the shows when ever she comes on the screen, be it on ramp or being hysterical on and off drugs, she plays such high-spirited roles with so ease and convenience that sometimes I feel that she definitely need a rehab! Priyanka is sassy and sparkling throughout the movie. I guess after Aitbaar this is the first time she has shown her gay shades in movies and I must say it suits her to the fullest. I could not praise the entire star cast as everyone has put a splendid show but can't leave three other picks which are Mugdha, Arbaaz and Kittu Gidwani. They are looks so apt and professional especially considering Mugdha as this is her debut she comes as a fresh breeze and makes a positive statement over her acting capabilities. What impresses me the most is every time I go for a Madhur film being assured that it will be naked truth yet convincing and this guy never lets you down, so real yet commercial. This quality of his film making put him on the list of top directors, another impressive fact is he like Yash Raj, Johars and other houses doesn't necessarily keeps his patent star cast for making a movie treat to watch but his thorough research and in-depth analysis and most importantly interweaved issues which depicts in the movies like in Fashion it was homosexuality, drugs, casting couch although it could be barred keeping in mind that glamour world cannot be discounted without it, this makes his work so unique. He is a real star maker; he can make deliver goods from anyone and everyone; kudos Madhur for the efforts and consistency. Undoubtedly until "Ghajani" and "Rab Ne Mila Di Jodi" comes this is going to be the best movie of the year from Bollywood." 
" Dark Side of Fashion Industry","I saw this movie yesterday and Priyanka Chopra's role as a Fashion Model was fantastic. The movie portrays the dark side of Indian Fashion Industry. Meghna Mathur (Priyanka) an ambitious girl from Chandigarh moves to Mumbai to become model, without the consent of her father. She struggles hard to become a model and faces the dark side of fashion industry. She becomes top model very soon but she becomes too much arrogant and involves in all immoral activities. Her career graph begin seeing downfall and she looses all friends and relations because of her excessive pride.The role of Kittu Gidwani and Priyanka reminds me of Meryll Streep and Anna Hathway from "Devil Wears Prada". Both movies are somewhat long and have similarities.The Cast in the movie is superb and well selected- Priyanka Chopra, Kangna Ranaut, Mugdha Godse, Arbaaz khan, Kitu Gidwani all were superb."Mar Jaava", " Aashiyana" Songs were also excellent and suits very well to theme of movie.A must see movie from (real life) film maker Madhur Bhandarkar." 
" The Movie of the Year","One of most realistic movies to be seen in recent Hindi Cinema.... Acting by everyone is done superiorly. And the movie have been greatly crafted to perfection.Special Credits to Kangana........her acting was superb with due respect to PC and RG Itz a complete WOW!!! experienceMadhur Bhandarkar has come with a gem this time around.You need to see this movie to enjoy it for a lifetime!!! If you don't' then you need to stop seeing movies then..............:P Thanks and Regards" 
" Fashion (with minor spoiler)","Thoughts tumble over each other as I try to process this movie. The glorious gam quotient, of course, is unmatched. Guys have to understand, you can't expect to find this much beauty and glamor in any other movie you go to. It is all over in that regard and the trophy has been surrendered to this movie.But there has to be more than that. And there is. The cast is loaded with old hands and newcomers, and they all give a lot. The star is Priyanka because she is telling the life story of her character. Everything is viewed through the prism of her changing perspective on her dreams. And I remember the moment in the movie when I let out a gasp of amazement at how wonderful she looked. Plus, this is her next movie achievement after Aitraaz. Many stories do not demand much of Priyanka. She's like a jewel in most movies that merely has to sparkle to justify the salary. In this movie, she has to dig into her soul and look beautiful and ugly and all the grades in between. This is the Priyanka rainbow folks.But she has superlative help. My startling discovery from this movie is Mugadha Godse. When I saw the PR pictures, featuring her with Kangana and Priyanka, my thought was, "she's pretty but doomed to be overshadowed". Well, I have to say that in the entire cast of characters, she's the one I liked best. I might have had to adjust that if Konkona Sen Sharma had had more than a cameo. But as it was, Mugadha was extraordinarily likable.After that there were others. Suchitra Pillai played the wife of Panache owner Abhijit. Every time she was on screen, my eyes were drawn to her. Now I hope they cast her again and again. She has SO much presence and dignity. I also liked Kitu Gidwani, who played Rahul's book publisher in Strangers, a tiny role. But still I remembered her. Her role is much bigger and more important in this movie, and she fits it perfectly.The guys who played the fashion designers were great without exception. But my top prize on that side of the cast is Arbaaz Khan. Arbaaz is the only actor from that Khan family that I trust. He doesn't do more nor less than a role requires. The other guys in his family have personality quirks that leave me with an off taste. But Arbaaz never disappoints me. I suppose that's why he has that glamorous wife and her child. He is a MAN.Some reviews call Kangana the real star of this movie. In some of her scenes, that is easy to understand. She starts the movie as the "show stopper", and when she marches out on the runway, there is a big voltage boost. But I have to protest her "James Dean" career. Like Mr. Dean, she always gets a non-survivor role. The first time I saw her, she was diving to her death from a tall building in Seoul. That made a huge emotional imprint on my memory. The next time she was locked up for her own good. Then she was KK Menon's floozy on the side. James Dean had a memorable career, but it was only 3 movies long. I want Kangana to do at least ten times that many, so she needs some movies where she shows she cannot be crushed, no matter how the world tries. I hope it starts soon.In Woh Lamhe, Sana is nursed back to sanity by Adi. It is a very touching section of the movie. In this movie, Shonali is nursed by Meghna. If I had to choose, my favorite will be Shonali and Meghna together. The fact is that Shonali saves Meghna's life. That's a big turnaround from Woh Lamhe. In a movie whose parts I liked so much, Shonali giving Meghna someone who she cares more about than herself, is my favorite part of the movie.This movie touched me more than any movie has in quite a while. I think there might be some people out there who will feel that way and be glad they went to a movie with heart.9/10" 
" Models Passion World is Fashion....Priyanka and Kangana are Madhur's Great Choice","Priyanka Chopra as Everyone know She is Miss World and know about Fashion world deeply also. Madhur Bhandarkar chose priyanka in lead role that's good luck to him and kangana ranaut is best actress undoubtely. A Girl how start her dream career in Mumbai that was showed awesome. And the models are how trap in other ways and the risk of fashion life Cleverly implemented. Madhur always comes with good stories this is perfect modeling story, He has showed in that screen very hypothically. Priyanka and Kangana are best performance on the screen, as Priyanka worked in modeling world earlier that is great advantage to win National Award through this film and Kangana also won best supporting actress. Then Everyone know how the movie was judged by National awards team to announce the awards. N Number of films will come in future on fashion and modeling this is the best picture ever. Priyanka,Kangana and Mugdha Godse so cool leading roles in entire movie. Thanks to Madhur Bhandarkar to made a good picture in bollywood on modeling."
