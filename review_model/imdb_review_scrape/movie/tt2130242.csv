" THE BEST REAL AND On screen COUPLE?","This movie is a very very good movie! It is one of those movies where you don't expect much at all but come out loving it. The comedy was superb and the storyline keeps you stuck to the movie. Genelia's acting is outstanding and i think she has proved that she is on par if not better with actresses the likes of Kareena Kapoor. Retish is also very good. Everyone was used perfectly and i say this is one of my favorite movies!! ALSO i must say that there chemistry on screen is amazing. Its good to see a real life couple that can actually translate it on to the big screen. GO WATCH IT IT IS WORTH THE MONEY THIS IS A MUST WATCH! **songs are good too!" 
" Finally a Great Movie!!!","This movie has a bit of everything; -> Romance, Action, Comedy My personal view is that this film stands out from all the other Bollywood movies lately. It has new ideas, great acting and wonderful shot locations. The movie has a normal but well acted story line. A lot of the credit goes to the leading actress that was able to take grasp of the film with her beauty and outstanding acting.Genelia D'Souza, Ritesh Deshmukh and Om Puri were outstanding,they knew exactly how to execute their roles. Providing us with jokes, mixed emotions and a good laugh. A film not to miss. There were many funny dramatic scenes that will keep you wanting to watch more. This film will not put you down." 
" Great movie Must watch one time","Great first solo movie by Ritesh & Genelia Deshmukh Good acting by Ritesh & Genelia Looking a real life couple First half of movie is good but second half is too good Specially after om puri entry movie looks good. All actor acted very well. Picturisation is good specially hariyna shown looking something different as i think i saw lots of movies picturised in out of India. The best alternative that the film chooses, however, is having Genelia D'Souza play the free-spirited girl over the over-exploited Kareenas and Katrinas that the genre has often seen. Genelia not only brings freshness to the genre but her camaraderie with Riteish Deshmukh is at full throttle as compared to all their earlier outings.The film primarily works thanks to the convincing chemistry and performances by the lead pair. Riteish Deshmukh is resourcefully restrained, perfectly poised and, needless to say, his comic timing is impeccable. At the same time he allows Genelia to take lead as the film largely revolves around her character. And Genelia does complete justice to her meaty role with a refreshing and dynamic act. Her cute looks and electrifying smile add to her appeal. From the character cast, Om Puri gets the best lines and induces frequent laughter. Veena Malik's item number was avoidable.Specially music is different & good.I think is must watch one time movie." 
" Hilarious !","This movie is only about Genelia and she does not fail to deliver. Great acting ..I have not seen any other actress having such range of facial expressions... The comedy is very good and I have not seen such a comedy in Hindi movies recently.. I wish to watch it again as soon as the DVD is released.This movie is set in Punjab and the songs are shot in beautiful locations in North India.Even though the theaters were empty on the first weekend, I believe this movie will pick up by word of mouth publicity. Go and watch this movie and come out of the theater with a big smile on your face." 
" Refreshing!","Simple, sweet and funny! It has all the ingredients of a super-hit romantic movie. Watching the comic antics of Genelia reminds me of the ever bubbly Juhi Chawla who made us laugh for more than a decade. Wonderful performances by everyone involved (Wish the south-Indian minister had more lines). Beautiful music, not overdone dialogues and a simple story which are so welcome. And of course, the icing on the cake are the songs by Atif Aslam and watching him perform at the end of the movie. You will fall in love with the newly wed couple, Genelia and Ritesh. You can feel that they had as much fun making the movie as we had seeing it. Can't wait for the DVD to be released." 
" Awesome, Excellent & Entertaining movie| Reteish & Genelia's romance was highlight","When we hear the word, "Tere Naal Love Ho gaya" the only thing that comes in our mind is a romantic movie, where the couple falls in love with each other and pass all the differences that come in their love life and live happily ever after. The best thing in this movie is that it's not one of a "cheesy,romantic and predictable" movie. It highlights each and every situation gradually. The romance between Viren ( Riteish) and Mini ( Genelia) has been shown as a gradual process. They mutually understands that they are in love with each other and the story goes on with that. The acting and the comic timing of both the actor is a double plus point. Both of them have done 100% justice to their roles being it to romance, comedy, thriller or fighting their emotions. After their film "Tujhe Meri Kasam" these two have proved that they are one of those pairs who were never being hyped up but once they are asked to act together they can take their level of romance to a completely different level. The songs in this movie adds a major plus point. Being the movie starting from "Jeene de" then "Pee pa pee pa ho gaya", "Tu muhaabat hain", "piya o re piya", ""Fan ban gayi". The soundtrack is fully awesome and one can listen to all the songs on repeat mode for any number of times. It adds on to the film and make it worth watching. Some scenes have been highlight to the movie being it " Mini seducing the petrol pump owner" to "Druken Scene" to "Introduction of Viren's family". Everything was just awesome and worth watching. The other actors apart from riteish and genelia, has given equivalent amount of weightage to the movie. All the actors and the scenes have been placed beautifully and thus makes the movie a MUST WACTH!! Awesome and excellent movie." 
" Fun movie..watch it.","Honestly, I didn't have any high expectations of this movie. A friend of mine suggested that I watch it, and the movie turned out to be a thorough entertainer. Its hilarious. P.S. Don't try to make any sense out of the story, its an out and out comedy movie, but not in any way a dumb one. Though there are no performances in the movie that are worth boasting. The chemistry between the lead pair is really sweet :). This is a light hearted movie. The pace at which the movie progresses is good. There are very very few dull moments in the movie. Almost all songs are nice and hummable. If you are in mood for a light hearted comedy, watch 'Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya', its a good one!!" 
" Refreshing female lead ( for a change in Bollywood)","Liked her acting big time. Bubbly and spontaneous.Story was crappy and so was the acting from rest of the cast. Her facial expressions reminded me of Sonali Kulkarni and Renuka Shahane from yesterday years.As someone commented in an earlier post, she will go a long way in Bollywood with the right director(s)Hope to see high quality movies with Genelia in the lead. She should choose good roles and avoid crappy stories like in this movieWish her all the best" 
" You can watch this all inspired stuff only for Genelia.","One of Bollywood's oldest but most used formula is to mix concepts taken from more than one Hit movies and then mash them together to make a new film for its audience. Incidentally both the movies released this week can be studied as a perfect example of this trend followed by the Hindi Film Industry from decades. But moving ahead of the uninteresting JODI BREAKERS, here we have a little better film in comparison, revolving around the same old concept of Love which starts developing between the lead couple as the film progresses and then they happily unite together after a dramatic climax.As far as the recipe of TERE NAAL LOVE HO GAYA goes, it straight away lifts or copies its first hour from Danny Boyle's A LIFE LESS ORDINARY (1997) which might have come across the makers while researching on the director, post his SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE. The opening sequences where Riteish loses his job, thinks of taking a revenge from his employer Tinnu Anand, goes to his house, get holds of a gun from security men and then unintentionally kidnaps Tinnu's daughter Genelia in a funny manner have all been taken from the English flick as it is. Amusingly in TNLHG, when Riteish is counting 1,2,3 with his fingers on the trigger, then Genelia says 3 from behind and the Gun goes off, whereas in the original Cameron Diaz says 5 and we hear the shot. Later, all the scenes of couple entering a deserted house by breaking the glass and then calling home for ransom, are also copied in this Hindi version in the most truthful manner. However the difference here is that in TNLHG, its Genelia who forces Riteish to kidnap her willingly, whereas in the original it's the boy who takes the call. And that is the only authentic insertion tried by the director in this first half.Post intermission the English influence gets replaced by our own Bollywood Hits likeDilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge or Jab We Met along with their Punjabi flavor, where either the boy or the girl is living with the family of the other and starts winning the hearts of its every important member with his cute gestures. In the present version it is the girl, Genelia who stays with Riteish's family, who are famous for their abduction profession all over the region. And then after this whole process of love in the air, it all ends with a dramatic climax as usual with a pinch of little suspense to keep your interest alive.So this is the recipe of Bollywood's latest romantic comedy made on the same old formula tried several times before. The film has an above average soundtrack by Sachin-Jigar which also has a Punjabi number sung by the current rage of Punjab, Diljeet and that is an intelligent addition to create some ripples in the North belt. Being in Punjabi Pop business from many years, TIPS very well knows this art of value- addition and they keep on using the same in their productions on a regular basis. Cinematography captures the outdoors of Punjab and its surrounding Hills well, which keeps the freshness intact despite of its repetitive storyline.But then why TNLHG is being rated here as much better than the rest? That's because it has a light, refreshing feel throughout, perfectly supported by the chemistry between the newly-wed couple, Riteish and Genelia. In fact Genelia's spirited performance along with the underplaying Riteish remains the key feature of this otherwise routine rom-com offering you the same old stuff in a new bottle. Genelia looks great and acts well showing his perfect comic timing especially in the second half. Her scenes along with the veteran Om Puri are the highlight of the film in its second hour.So, even if TERE NAAL LOVE HO GAYA doesn't offer anything new in the name of content, storyline or execution, it can still be seen once only for Genelia." 
" Perfect meaning of romantic movie","The one of the best romantic movie, direction was well. Genelia again showed her skill in acting, but rithesh was bad in dancing but he done is role good." 
" Comedy movie,nice time pass should watch it!!!! Ritesh and genelia rocks","Awesome story some people are saying it's bad but it's a wonderful movie really good acting....must watch" 
" Typical romantic comedy only watchable in second half","Am a big fan of Ritiesh ever since I saw him in Masti, but Ritiesh has mostly been successful in multistarrers or 2 hero films, As solo hero except Tujhe Meri Kasam his debut which was a small hit, his solo films tanked. Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya was trying to cash on the Ritiesh-Genelia just married couple jodi but they forgot that when pairs are repeated after marriage their films mostly fail, Be it Ajay-Kajol in Dil Kya Kare which was a flop or many more to name a few. This film starts off as a normal romantic comedy stars, It's all seen before, nothing out the world, The Ritiesh-Genelia scenes are funny in parts but overall nothing really great. The second half we are thrown into Ritiesh's family in Haryana or somewhere, where we are introduced to his kidnapper father Om Puri, Smita Jaykar and some cartoons as his fake brothers and sisters. but here the film does get funny in several portions but then drags and ends as a normal romantic comedyDirection is okay Music was a big hit, Many songs were famous like Piya by Atif and other songs as well, But why Ritiesh has to copy SRk in the song who himself is not a good dancer? Ritiesh Deshmukh does his job earnestly as always, he is one of our natural actors of bollywood though the role is hardly demanding for him, his attempt is to get successful as a solo hero but the film was an average only at the B.O. Genelia does a good job too and is high on energy Their chemistry is good Om Puri is amazing in his role, bringing the house down Smita Jaykar is okay, Navin Prabhakar is okay, Chitrashi is funny, Tinnu Anand is okay" 
" Watch it only if you have nothing else to do or you love Genelia like no other woman in the world","With its lackluster dialogues, bad direction, and clichéd story, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya is nothing but a waste of time. For me, who is a Genelia worshipper (saying 'fan' would be an understatement), it kills me to say that after 'Orange', this is her second movie I had to stop in between because I couldn't tolerate it anymore and had to complete it in two passes. The only saving grace for this movie is the vivacity of Genelia and Om Puri's acting, in this movie which otherwise lacks any shining points. Though the writer has intended a lot of scenes to be funny, but they come across as worthless, especially the one where Genelia teaches Om Puri about the 'Organizer' feature on his mobile phone.There is an overdose of sweetness in this movie, which most often but not leaves a bad taste in the mouth, like the one when you eat too much jaggery or drink too much of fruit juice." 
" random nonsense","An excuse for a movie. Its hard to believe this movie got a budget. An incompetent director and a poor story line story line brings together a poor actor in Ritesh Deshmukh and Genelia who hams her way through the movie.....good grief!!!! Om Puri tries hard to look serious and this movie is an insult to his talent. The only thing that is remotely passable in that Genelia looks great and the locations are scenic. There is possibly a song or 2 which sound good.Was available for free on Netflix...and we ended up wasting some precious time of our lives. Save yourself the horror!!!!!"
