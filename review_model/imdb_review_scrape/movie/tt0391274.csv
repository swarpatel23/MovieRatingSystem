" Not as bad as people say! One of Bobby Deol's best performances!","I'm not sure what the director was going for with this film but the soundtrack, look and feel of the film in general suggests that it was made in the format of those sort of 1970s crime capers. But I may be wrong. Either ways, it looks good and was decently made.Anywho, It's Bobby Deol again and here he plays Tony, the city's #1 gangster, a man who has grown into a far cry from the young 'Amitabh Bachchan' loving boy whom we meet in the beginning of the film. But it's not entirely his fault, he was abandoned on a train by his aunt and uncle at such a tender age and left to fend for himself. Now he has grown into a thug who does dirty dealings, works with loan sharks and in general just does shady businesses.Tony soon meets Sapna Gosai (played by Priyanka Chopra) a budding pop singer with whom he becomes entranced and eventually falls in love with. He would do anything for Sapna but is temporarily sidetracked when he discovers that she is engaged to someone else. Goli, Tony's friend(played by Sanjay Narvekar) warns him against delving too deep into emotions with Sapna but Tony doesn't listen. One day, he takes on a job to rough up a health inspector, Dr. Hargobind Gosai (played by Mohan Joshi) who is giving problems to local business men by suspecting their products. Tony takes the job and scares the Doctor into signing a document that would allow expired drugs to be sold on the market. When three babies wind up dead, the police close in on the doctor and arrest him after their investigation proves that he signed a false document. A citywide uproar ensues, the doctor is thrown in jail and his family disgraced. Sapna just happens to be his daughter and little does she know that her friend Tony is responsible for her family's woes. Mrs. Gosai (played by Smita Jaykar) soon becomes overwhelmed by her husband's jail lunacy as well as her daughter's broken engagement and unable to carry the weight of it all commits suicide. When Tony come to the realisation that it was Sapna's Father that he shook down, he is filled with regret and remorse and vows to bring all those who hired him to do the job in the first place to justice. Kabir Bedi co-stars as a Godfather-like mob boss named Raj Mallya, the one Tony intends on taking down. I loved Bobby Deol in this movie! He is one of the most overlooked actors working in Bollywood today." 
" Where did this movie come from?","My goodness, this film makes me feel like I've been warped back in time to like 1993, when Bollywood wasn't exactly at its highest point.  This disastrous film is nothing but a terrible combination of all the cliched scenes ever made in the history of Bollywood.  The age-old story of the Mafia putting drugs in baby food is so old, it's not even funny.  A popular celebrity doesn't just randomly pull in a guy from a crowd to replace her hero in her movie.  The placement of the songs are so random--they have no relevance whatsoever to the story.  The climax is so absolutely idiotic, its funny.  I could not stand this movie, so I ended up fast forwarding a good 80-90% of it.  Save yourself the trouble by not checking this movie out." 
" Alice in the wonderland","Lets review the movie again. All goes a little O.K. until Doctor Gosai goes to jail. Now comes the problem. I am unable to understand why there was not even a single attempt made by him to prove himself innocent and by the way, when he signed the clearance of vaccines, why did not he go to police and tell them the truth that he has signed N.O.C. under death threat? When Tony feels guilty, why does he not himself go to court and tell that he was the one who got the papers signed from Gosai. When Vikas Patel gets a bullet in his shoulder, how can he smile in front of Tony and tell him that he was looking for him? The actions scenes were one of the worst ever made. Bobby Deol is a brilliant action hero but is wasted by poor actions. What was the action director doing? I think the finances were finished at the end of the movie and that is why its climax comes so suddenly but it was good because by that I was saved from trouble of seeing more piece of crap. Mr. Dhanoa! come on, direction is not your piece of cake. So muchhhhhhhh sillllllllyyyyy mistakes cannot be tolerated.For viewers, skip this one for your own sake." 
" Outdated","Bobby Deol tried hard to recreate his brother's angry young man roles but sadly except Badal and Bichhoo his rest films flopped. Kismat is a film that is as old as hills. Another attempt by Guddu Dhanoa to get a hit with old formula We have Tony(Bobby) who becomes a thief with a cheesy old background story, he falls for actress Priyanka Chopra. Priyanka's hero doesn't get steps right so Bobby enters and says he will dance and Priyanka agrees? Lol The film does have some good scenes but there are few and far. Everything is so predictable that it's boring. Priyanka's stardom is not shown in second half where she roams alone everywhere.Direction is nothing great. Music is nothing great eitherBobby Deol does well in his role but it hardly seems challenging enough Priyanka Chopra is okay, this was her fourth film after The Hero, Andaaz and Plan and 3rd flop except Andaaz all rest too flopped. Kabir Bedi gets less scope and is usual, Mohan Joshi is okay Virendra Saxena, Shahbaaz Khan are as usual, Ashish Vidyarthi annoys rest are okay." 
" Faith !!!","Tony (Bobby Deol), who have been serving penance from the time he was born. Was left sleeping on a train by his uncle and aunt at a very young age. Lonely, Way-ward and hungry, he decided to work for a gangster name Vikas Patil (Ashish Vidyarthi) who has connections with the underworld don Raj Mallya (Kabir Bedi). Raj Mallya sells spurious drugs to little children who are sick, one day, the drug happen to kill three children. Didn't want to take the blame, Raj Mallya, decided to put the blame on Dr. Hargobind Gosai, so he entrusted the task to Patil and Patil to Tony, into getting the doctor to sign an agreement paper. Dr. Hargobind case is try in court and he is proved guilty and awarded a life sentence. Upon, this no lawyer is willing to accept his case. Tony, upon reaching up with super star Sapna (Priyanka Chopra) falls in love with her. When he hears she loves a doctor Ajay Saxena and is going to get engaged to him, he was heart broken, and also finding out that Dr. Hargobind Gosai is Sapna's father, he is more depressed and he decided only to follow one path but the truth and he is soon shown some light and Sapna to become his bride."
