" If you want to make remake then make better then original","if you want TO MAKE REMAKE A FILM LIKE "BEST OF THE BEST" THEN YOU SHOULD PREPARE YOUR SELF FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING with movie the story is same but character detailing and action sequences are not even 50 percent of original movie.i think movie is just hit because of its made diplomatic controversy between India and Pakistan. in this i think they shouldn't involve cricket.technically is not acceptable that one cricketer change his line to get revenge of his brotherbut i still give it five star because if you don't seen the original one then i am sure you will like it and enjoy it." 
" Childish, unrealistic and shameful","A shamefully one-sided and unrealistic film, as childish as children's cartoons where one guy is portrayed as hero who always does the right thing and the other as villain who always does the wrong things, apparently made by a bunch of idiots who first of all know absolutely nothing about Pakistan, and who only promote hatred and propaganda. I was highly disappointed given that this film got some accolades at the level of national film awards. From cheap acting to lousy screenplay and direction to the fact that it is not even remotely true to the ground realities, it is a shamefully disappointing effort. The fact that this film won accolades at the national level in India itself contradicts the propaganda the film tries to promote, i.e. India's willingness to promote peace and resolve tensions between the two countries." 
" A beautiful movie with a great message","I watched this movie after hearing a lot about all the international awards that were bagged by the film-makers. But after watching Lahore, I realize how much potential Indian film makers have and Indian movies are not all about singing & dancing around trees. About the movie, I would say, watch it for story line which stay on track, the brilliant performance of Aanaahad and Farooq Shaikh, for the brilliantly shot fight sequences (rarely seen in an Indian movie, mostly they are over the top), good background score and lastly, but not the least, the direction and editing. Sanjay Chauhan has done an awesome job, the movie does not loose pace, the script is tight and the viewer gets engrossed very easily into the lives of the characters. I felt the start was a bit confusing (first 5 min) but once the movie unfolds one finds out what is actually going on. I would recommend this to one and all. If movies like this one keep on being made in India, we can actually hope that we can remove the monopoly of the Yash Raj type director/producers from India who think that an Indian viewer has no sense and will watch anything." 
" Festering Hate","I too like many who watched this movie, read the "internationally acclaimed reviews", but I was disappointed not only by the cliché unoriginal plot (which copies itself from movies such as Best of the Best, KickBoxer, and ever fight movie from the 80s) but also disappointed with the propaganda in the movie. India and Pakistan have the largest militarized border in the world, fought three wars, and have one of the world's most intense rivalries...I know. But I also know that everywhere in the world OUTSIDE of the South Asian continent Indians and Pakistanis are above all friends. We share a common heritage, culture, and language that transcends the pride we hold. This movie was touted as a fair movie and "tolerant" but it is far from it. Its only accomplishment is to further deepen the rift through inaccurate and racist portrayals. Shame on the movie makers. As for the movies content the fight scenes were far from mediocre, the actors do NOT look like kickboxers, and the plot was very predictable. Being Pakistani I caught myself feeling anger and resentment towards my Indian brothers, and I know had an Indian person watched this they would feel the same towards a Pakistani. Why? As Ghandi (may he rest in peace) said "We must become the change we want to see."Mahatma Gandhi quote" 
" Dragged its feet and lacked punch.","Considering the themes and potential, it was very disappointing. The evocative opening credits promised much more than the muted, dumbed-down mess that followed.This film should have shed an hour to hit a more effective fighting weight. It was flabby, slow, dull and predictable. The sparse action choreography was passable, but not great. I would say it was more of a drama than an action movie, but the acting wasn't really strong enough for that, either.Despite its many flaws and its heavy-handedness, it did manage to muster a little impact for the finale, but I'm not sure it was worth the slog." 
" Warner Bros presents "Joh Jeeta Wohi Sikander + Apne"","Lets keep the record straight, Lahore is "Joh Jeeta Wohi Sikander" to the "T". If JJWS dealt with two brothers, so does Lahore. If JJWS had the school rivalry as the under-currents, in Lahore we have the political rivalry between India and Pakistan. Call it twist of fate, and the younger brother attempts to redeem himself by taking on the unfinished business. By the way, did I mention "Apne"? Yes because that had uncanny similar plot too. But the original still remains sacrosanct, a masterpiece from Mansoor Khan (who sadly taken a long sabbatical).☻ Sushant Singh:: As elder brother Dheeru he has put in extra effort to the character. His chemistry with Shraddha Nigam was just about right. ☻ Aanaahad:: Very strong debut. A striking personality. Has what is takes and deliver well. The romance bit with Shraddha Das was not fleshed out convincingly. ☻ Mukesh Rishi:: Good choice to play the role of Noor Mohammed who has his own demons to battle against. ☻ Farooq Sheikh:: As usual he is impeccable ensuring you will remember the diction of Mr. Rao. Shares a good chemistry with Saurabh Shukla.☻ Nafisa Ali:: Quite adequate.The rest of star-cast were OK (Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Jeeva, Pramod Moutho, Ashish Vidyarthi & Nirmal Pandey).The director balances the sensibilities of both Indian and Pakistan viewers ensuring nobody cries foul. The DOP deserves a special mention for the lighting he has used ensuring it get the international feel. The fight sequences are executed quite well. The background absorbs the viewer into the storyline. Every character has depth and the director has managed to bring out layers. The ending was quite apt (though I feel the apology part should have been edited out - some things are better left untold). Way to go Mr. Sanjay Puransingh Chauhan!" 
" Lahore is mostly watchable","'LAHORE' is one of the good Indian sports movie defying boundaries i have ever seen. This movie has something right about it despite a predictable plot , really made my day , the director has done a tremendous job.The Actors have done quite a job too which complemented the film.And it's also a WARNER BROS. film , so these guys know where to put in the money though i feel sorry that these sort of movies ...drop dead before cumin to our theatersand Please do not compare this movie to the Hollywood's best because this film has a different touch and situation to it.SO GUYS PLEASE DO WATCH IT !!" 
" Lahore - A quality film that does strike a chord","I watched this movie today and definitely came back with a stirred heart. Well, before I get carried away let me share the USPs of this movie: [1.] commendable performances by all the actors although there was no big star cast[2.] slick kick boxing stunt scenes, very clean and sophisticatedHowever, this movie had its own share of flaws: [1.] The movie failed to show the closeness of the relationship between the brothers in the first half which was pivotal to the plot. Instead, the lead actor seemed more close to his sister-in-law than to his brother. [2.] In the second half there should have been some sequence showing the kick-boxing training given to Aanaahad since he was basically a cricket player trying to fill in his brother's shoes [3.] The ending of the movie was a bit too melodramatic. I think it could have been more practical.Overall, it was a good movie that keeps you gripped all the way through." 
" Yet another copy from Bollywood","For those of you who really liked this movie, please go and watch the American movie "Best of the Best" made in 1989. Yes, this movie is yet another copy from bollywood. What really surprises me is that being a copy of an American film, how can this movie win any award and yet being internationally acclaimed??? This movie doesn't reach up to the original version, Best of the Best. The fight scenes are really not impressive at all. If you see the original movie, you'll be well entertained with great fight sequences and really see the fighters fighting without using any special effects (cables).Mukesh Rishi looks too old for his character in this movie. Aanahad has good physics and probably a professional kick-boxer in real life too, but as far as acting is concerned, well......" 
" Nice movie but could have been much better.","Lahore is the movie which promises you a lot with its heart in right place but at times it's so plain and dumb that is hard to digest.Story is nothing really new to offer except the theme this time being Kick boxing sport. About the characters; Aanaahad is a let down, his dialog delivery is poor and face expression are hardly convincing apart from few scenes.Sushant Singh gives a decent performance as there was not very much scope for him to show this true potential.Nafisa Ali uttering about a couple of dialogs of doting caring typical Indian mother could not have any value to movie.Mukhesh Rishi again does good as a bad guy but his character look way too idiot as if the word logic and organ brain is missing for him.Shraddha's face is so much under the layers of makeup that you wish some should remind her that use of face wash does not hurt anybody.Farooq Shaikh is the who steals the show with his hyderabadi style accent.His Pakistani counterpart Sabyasachi Chakraborty is awesome and convinces you to hate him like anything. Over all a decent one time but could have been better if editing have been more crispier and story told in a much better manner." 
" Good Work!!","Lahore, the directorial venture by Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan is clichéd, highly predictable at times, having lot of flaws, etc etc.. But despite of all these shortcomings, it manages to moisten the viewers' eyes towards the ending. 'An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind', the quote of Mahatma Gandhi, is well depicted in the movie, and that alone is a reasonable factor to watch the movie.Lahore is about two brothers, and two countries, too. The story has nothing so new, it goes as expected by the viewers, the director has managed to execute it in a not-so boring manner, that he saves it from being called as a Documentary.The performances are fine, the main protagonist Aanaahad is a look-alike of Randeep Hooda, he does his part well, Sushant Singh was good, Farooque Sheikh, Nafisa Ali, Mukesh Rishi, Shraddha Nigam all were good, and special mention to Shraddha Das, she looked like the mock-female roles Shreyas Talpade and Reitesh Deshmukh had played in their previous films.The music by MM Kreem is average, and the cinematography is fine.On the whole, Lahore is a good movie with an awesome, fantastic ending. Watch it, you will know!!" 
" Friendship between nations","Loosely based in one of my favorite American martial arts movies "Best of the best", this Indian martial arts film has a clear message of friendship between two nations, India and Pakistan but although of that, the film was not released in Pakistan because they considered that the movie shows the country in bad light..The musical moments are much more tolerable than in other Idian films that I've watched, here are just part of the story and nobody suddenly begins to dance and sing crazily for over ten minutes Emoticono tongue but the weakest point of the movie are the fights in the ring, nothing spectacular, slow and sometimes even clumsy, it is very obvious that none of the actors has a martial arts background..." 
" Only the concluding 30 minutes of this extended episode of "Apne" earned it all those awards.","The well designed poster of the movie giving the feel of a western flick, did attract many eye balls at the theaters before its release. And the numerous Awards mentioned on them in bold, were also able to create a certain level of curiosity for the project. But somehow the visual promos aired on the Television channels were not matching with all those good things being said and written about the movie. So, I had my own doubts before watching "Lahore" which more or less proved exactly the same as I had thought.Based on a sports subject, talking specifically about Kick Boxing and partly about Cricket, the movie revolves around the story of two real brothers trying to make a name in these two sports individually. But "Lahore" doesn't start like a masterpiece as projected. Right from the beginning it looks like just another average product with OK performances and a seen before storyline. The reason being, it can easily be called an extended version of the Deol family's "Apne", where also the younger brother comes in to take the revenge for the defeat of his big bro in the ring. The only novelty added to it by the writers is the Indo-Pak peace mission angle handled in a very intelligent manner towards the end.In fact till the movie reaches its climax, you keep wondering why it was showered all that appreciation in the festival circuit when it has nothing in content as per those standards. May be all the Jury members were not aware of any other movie on the same subject called "Apne". Amazingly, I also couldn't find anyone else pointing towards the similarity between these two movies in the print. Anyhow, the tables get turned towards the end, when the movie delivers a brilliantly and sincerely directed climax sequence which successfully manages to win over the viewer, leaving him in tears.And after you have seen the concluding moments of "Lahore", you get to understand why it was able to win hearts of all those Jury members in the festivals. The final sequence of the movie, very effectively gives out the message of peace to both India & Pakistan which should surely receive equal admiration from the two neighbors. The debutant director Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan makes a sort of comeback in the end and hits a sixer. But if only he could create the same kind of impact throughout the movie, the results would have been far better.In short, "Lahore" is only watchable for its superb climax and is not able to impress with its overall content. There are many flaws in its screenplay and direction which restricts itself to move over an above average product. For instance, it's not that easy for a player to shift to an altogether different game and that also on a National level representing the country. Also Kick Boxing is not such a famous game in India and Pakistan that people will find easy to relate to. Another fact which came to my mind while watching "Lahore" was that why Cricket looks like such a dumb game on the screen, whereas in real life it's so thrilling and compelling? Why, no director has been able to bring the same magic of the game on the screen as it is on the actual field? Till date, the only movie which came close to the spirit of Cricket was "Lagaan" but that too dealt in a pre independence era of the game.There is another debut in "Lahore" of Aanahaad, who gives his best in the fight scenes but is just OK in the rest. Sushant Singh, Shraddha Nigam and the girl playing the Pak lady, act impressively. Mukesh Rishi looks tough and gives the right killing looks. Kelly Dorji, Saurabh Shukla and K. Jeeva play it low, but Nirmal Pandey, Nafiza Ali and Ashish Vidyarthi have nothing much to do. The most shining star of the movie is Farukh Sheikh who is simply superb as the National Coach fighting for his rights and students with the minister. The major asset of "Lahore" remains its Kick Boxing sequences canned skillfully by the cinematographer Neelab Kaul. Music by M. M . Kreem is not having any gem as always expected from the maestro, but the background music is effective. In all, if you love watching sports movies, then "Lahore" will satisfy you partially. I really wish the whole movie was as good as its climax. Still, the director, Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan clearly gives us the glimpses of a great director in the making. Proving his fine vision of the medium, choice of subject and look of the project, he is sure going to be a huge asset in the hands of a big corporate house."
