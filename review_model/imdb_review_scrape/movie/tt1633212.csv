" Let's wait, pray more, and expect less.","The director Pooja Bhatt had done some good films in the past, be it her previous flick 'Dhokha', or her debut film 'Paap'. But, Pooja Bhatt was often termed as an offbeat director. So, since the day the news of her doing a film with Himesh, the buzz was that she would be doing a fully commercial masala movie this time. Also, the hopes were high, as Mahesh Bhatt is the writer. So, the fans of Himesh Reshammiya, including me, didn't lose hope even after the box-office failures of Karzzzz and Radio. Everybody hoped that Kajraare will be a breakthrough for Himesh. The hopes were not shattered even after the release of the first promo and the Official Soundtrack of the movie. The songs looked quite innovative and good.But, the sequences of mismashes started then. Bhushan Kumar indefinitely delaying the film, stopping the promos and songs of the film to be aired in TV, and we, the fans were disappointed. Still, we had hope, and I remember we used to send lot of mails to T-series asking about Kajraare. Let me also say that we never got any reply for any of our mails. And then, one day we come to know that the film got released in 2 theatres, that also 1 show each. I was so sad on this, that I couldn't even do my job properly that day. All our expectations were let down by this Bhushan Kumar. What all we thought, the movie will be good, and it will be a slap on the faces of the people who says Himesh is useless. We expected critics giving the movie ratings of 3.5 or 4, saying "Himesh has improved a lot in acting, and it is one of the main highlights of the film ,along with an engaging screenplay, soothing music and stunning locations", but nothing happened, no critic bothered to watch it and write a review.The only hope left was it to be aired in some TV channel, and we expected it to be shown in TV for Diwali. Thank God, at least our expectations were right this time. Tata Sky and Airtel DTH started showing the movie from Diwali day. The DTH rips were out the next day, so everybody finally got a chance to watch Kajraare, at least on small screen.Well, the movie started with Mahesh Bhatt's narration, and the titles were shown. The name of Bhushan Kumar was mentioned nowhere, no credits were given to the Producer. The credits show Himesh walking here and there, through desert and such things, and from the lyrics, he is in search of somebody ,presumably his 'Mahiya' (Lover). But why this desert and all? No answer. And, then the heroine's introduction, it is quite confusing. After this song 'Rabba Luck Barsa' only Himesh meets the heroine, then who is his 'Mahiya' in that song?? Any previous affair?? And, later we come to know that this Himesh can't live in India, so he travelled to some other country ,I think Dubai. Now, I come to know what was shown in the first song. Yes, he was walking to Dubai from India, I guess!!! Later, the song 'Kajraare' follows, and the song doesn't match the situation, especially the female rap portion by Sunidhi Chauhan. Had it been an unplugged solo version of that song, the impact would have been excellent.There is an implicit rule that Himesh Reshammiya's films should have songs in a gap of 8-10 minutes. The same pattern has been followed from his first movie AKS, to Kajraare. The songs are, however good. The first half proceeds in songs and meetings with the heroine, and a disturbing dream from his past. While watching the movie, I didn't feel that I'm watching a 2010 movie. It looked somewhat old, the script and all were like that.Later, in the proceedings of the movie, the flashback and the reason for Himesh running away from his identity are revealed, and they don't look so convincing. Seems the director did that in a hurry, that it ended up in just one scene. There are few beautiful scenes individually, but on the whole it doesn't make much of an impact.Himesh Reshammiya had shown a refreshing performance in his previous film Radio. But again in Kajraare, he is not upto the mark. His expressions are not that strong, but I like his dialogue delivery. It is good. This guy is simply wasting his career by sticking into his policies, but let us not lose hope, and wait for his next album to come out. But I advise, stick to composing and singing, Himeshji.. Please..The new girl Mona Laizza has no charm at most of the places. Of course, he character is grey-shaded, but she could have been showcased more beautifully. Acting wise, she has done a confident debut. Hope she gets more roles in future.The remaining cast includes a cold-faced Amrita Singh, who maintains the same expressions throughout the movie, Jaaved Sheikh who has nothing much to do other than begging 'maaro mujhe, maaro mujhe', and Gulshan Grover who does a typical clichéd character. The villain character played by Adnan Shah was fine, in my opinion. The rest of the cast was okay.The film boasted of great visuals, but nothing so great was found in real. The locations of Jordan and all looked nothing extra ordinary.The music is the main highlight of the movie, there are few excellent tracks, and the songs are also picturised well, except for 'Kajraare' song.On the whole, Kajraare doesn't reach my expectations. Mahesh Bhatt has come up with a loose screenplay, and it affected the movie so badly. I really expected this movie would be a tight slap on the face of those haters, but nothing happened.My rating for the movie would be 3/5 as a Himesh fan, but otherwise it is 2.25/5." 
" 0k Movie","Starting with the story of the movie.. the story was gok but sometimes it make the movie more like a unbelievable fairy tale and some times it lacks the story.. Himesh(R0cky) is a unknown person who is traveling from places to places because of his past and he saw Mona Laizza(Nargis) and fall in love with her her... some times the story gets very difficult to understand because of some bad writing i guess its the writer fault.Acting and Music Himesh was very good he acted better then in his last movie radio songs were good Mona Laizza did good job in this movie she was in character all the time not in the starting i thought she missed it but after few mins when she start talking it was good and i was shocked :p.. Gulshan Grover was 0k same for Javed Sheikh..it was a good time pass on the whole i give it 7/10 for acting and music i don't like the story very much because of the terrorists and all.." 
" Musical tale of love and passion...","It was a moment which the heavens had pre-ordained. When Rajiv Behl, a well-to-do drifter with no particular destination, first laid his eyes on the beautiful but melancholic face of Nargis in the hush of the pre-dawn light, on the deserted streets of Jordan, he knew that she was the one that the Gods had created just for him.But strange are the ways of the world. As Rajiv pursues Nargis he soon finds out to his utter shock that she comes from a lineage of tawaaifs from Pakistan's Heera Mandi and she is about to be sold to the highest bidder. His quest for love hurls him into the famous Red Light district of Shahi Mohalla in Lahore, a region where supposedly 'fallen' women and the men who benefit financially from them, rub shoulders with ordinary folk. Here, he has to lock horns with the woman who controls the Red Light district, the foul mouthed Zohra Bai, who believes that the only creed of a tawaaif is to be a pleasure peddler. To leave Shahi Mohalla in order to lead a normal life is forbidden.In his attempt to save his love from her terrible fate, Rajiv embarks on a journey to outbid those who want to buy her, and in the process, is compelled to re-connect with his true identity. This opens a Pandora's box, which not only shocks his beloved Nargis but makes him a moving target all over again.For Rajiv is actually Rocky, a pop star of Indian origin from UK, who has incurred the wrath of Baabar, the dreaded international terrorist. Rocky has not only subverted one of his major terrorist plans two years ago, he has also testified against him in a court of law. Rocky is therefore under a witness protection programme and his life is now in serious danger....When Avtar Singh, the head of the Counter-Terrorist Unit in the UK reprimands Rocky for being reckless, and tells him that the only way he can protect his loved one is to stay away from her, Rocky decides to stop being the hunted... and turns into the hunter. He vows to find Baabar and kill him.Is the union of Rocky and Nargis really pre-ordained by the Gods or is it merely the desire of a young man? Does the rockstar overcome the treachery of a Trans–national terrorist and if yes, how? Does Rocky succeed in finding emancipation for Nargis? Come and find out in this musical tale of love and passion... KAJRAARE."
