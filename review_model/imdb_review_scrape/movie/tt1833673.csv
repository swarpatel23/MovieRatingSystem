" Rhetoric On Ropes","Iqbal Khan (Jackie Shroff) is a misunderstood artist of his generation. He is a visionary. He is not interested in rendering a generic circus machinery: that of hackneyed antics, animals (ill-treated behind the stage) and forced glamour. The callous bank executive — metaphorical of Philistine corporations and close-minded audience — is predisposed to reject his plea, with hidebound contention that viewers only expect puerility from circus. The director sets the scene of Iqbal Khan's plights within seconds of his introduction. The young Sahir (played by brilliant Siddharth Nigam) evades bullies in an act of mini-parkour. It's a swift and effective introduction — a tap on his potential, for things to come.The trial circus show of 1990 is filmed very well. There's soft 'malang' tune in the background. The circus props would evolve in the future acts. The hat-throwing trick of the father and the son would later be replicated in the final robbery with motorbikes replacing hats.Although 'Dhoom' films are set in real world, they are quasi-fantasy films. The director makes sure that the implausible stunts are shot aesthetically. This is what separates a good director from an ordinary director. Every scene in 'Dhoom 3' has a function. There is a circus motif in each robbery. Tightrope walking is a common feature in circus and riding bicycle on a tightrope is a possible feat. Accordingly, the motorbike on high-rope is fully thematic in the quasi-fantasy realm of 'Dhoom'. Since motorbikes are essential in 'Dhoom' series, it makes for a thematic correlation between the 'Dhoom' trope and circus.Victor Acharya uses slow-motion and ultra-slow-motion to a great effect in the motorbike scenes, without relying on gaudy tableaux. Then he immediately gets back to the normal speed: it enhances the effect of motorbike's acceleration.The second escape adventure is a riveting spectacle. The taut background music underlines Sahir's predicament when the motorbike reaches the bridge. Sahir underplays well through his countenance of predicament. The scene also harks back to James Bond films where Bond uses gadgets to get out of trouble. Herein, the motorcycle unbelievably transforms into a Jet-Ski. After all, magic is meant to be unbelievable: a mix of sleight, contrivance and deception. Sahir, again, relies on circus acrobatics and magic tricks to escape. The VFX transformation is top-notch. The entire scene is wonderfully executed without any toffee-nosed rush or jumpy chopping. The editor does a fine job in knowing when to chop and when to spare.In both robberies, Sahir uses the disappearing trick (taught by his father) to circumvent the police.None of the songs are forced in the narrative. The 'malang' song is well-timed at a crucial juncture before the interval. The prelude has a sense of grandeur, silhouettes representing the young Sahir and his father. Malang has so much potential that it could have become a meta-movie in the song itself. But it is still impressive, grandly expressionist with colours, shadows, outlandish creatures and magic.Like the previous 'Dhoom' movies, the background music is superlative. Julius Packiam blends it finely in the narrative: at times subtle, at times prominent as per the situation. It lingers on even after the movie ends. One gets to appreciate the background music more during repeat viewings. A big revelation comes at the point of interval. This scene, again, is very well directed. The good thing about Victor Acharya is that he knows when to accelerate and when to slow down. Following the confrontation with Jai, Sahir ensconces towards his room. It's a long take with no dialogue. The length engenders a feeling of suspense. As Sahir sits on the chair, probably facing a mirror (a common mode of cinematography), one can hear his breathing. The camera circles slowly, the silence adds to the anticipation.Abhishek Bachchan shares more screen-time with Aamir Khan than he did with his adversaries in 'Dhoom' and 'Dhoom 2'. He shows a menacing streak in the scene where he interrogates Sahir. Since everything has to be done in the 'Dhoom' framework, the film misses out on opportunities of what they could have done with Jai's character, as well as a few other things, because in many ways, it's Jai Dixit who comes across as a stubborn antagonist.A propos the act in India, the idea was to play it to the gallery with a rustic fight scene. The auto-rickshaw feature, however, is unbefitting to the 'Dhoom' template. Ideally they could have harked back to the brilliant chor bazaar (black market) scene from 'Dhoom 1'; that scene had a riveting escape (with Jai and Ali being the absconders instead of chasers) and a little story behind it. But here, there is no back story, no motif and no 'Dhoom' twinge on the rustic tableau.'Dhoom 3' also succeeds in bringing old-school rhetoric to the fore. The poem 'bandey hain hum uske' is orated throughout the film in different tones, each at a key moment. Sahir and Iqbal Khan disperse a few memorable dialogues.Aamir Khan takes care of aesthetics and nuances in a remarkable performance. As always he stays true to his character. There is no reliance on past glory, self-reference or braggadocio. His poised countenance and that remarkable stance make the motorcycle scenes more effective. He gives Sahir an aura of mystique when he goes to meet Jai Dixit at the police headquarters. His fine hat, tilted a tad upwards, gives him an air of a sly jester. In a scene where the audience cheered the loudest, Sahir says, 'When sleight, contrivance and deception converge, people think it's magic.' During the dialogue, he scratches his face with the gun with an old-fashioned panache. Whether it's a nod to the old-school acting or personal mannerism, it goes well with the rhetoric. This is the closest he can come to self-reference." 
" Two thumbs up","{Bandey hain hum uske humpe kiska zor}Jackie Shroff recites the motivational poem elegantly. He is a damn good actor without any doubt. He is like a chameleon who adapts himself well into whatever part he is given. I don't think the film industry has done justice to his potential. The super-talented Sidharth Nigam and Jackie form a great father-son duo for a short period. Would it have been better to start the film with the robbery and then show the 1990 Chicago later on in a flashback? Hard to say. It doesn't make much of a difference to the final show.Dhoom 3 is basically a mix of bikes and circus themes with loads of thrills and the usual entertainment. It is a true escapist entertainer. Motorbikes make a full-on comeback to the Dhoom world. Watching Aamir on the bike is a high. Watching two Aaamirs is even better. His dedication is astounding. He took a year to get in shape for a circus guy's role. One can see how important it is to look that part. His acting is predictably top class.There is no plagiarism here or in Ghajini as many people still complain. People need to watch it with an open mind. {Watch Barfi, Zeher, Taxi No. 9211 to see what plagiarism means}. Vijay K. Acharya is a dreamer. He is a man who follows his passion. His command over his material is praiseworthy. Truly underrated director. The cinematography is praiseworthy. The slow-mo scenes are well done. {I am usually not a fan of slow-mo fights but Acharya has done them in a uber-cool way}. Abhishek does well and Uday doesn't get much room. The action is extraordinary. It is meant to be that way and must be received in that spirit." 
" An honest appraisal of an honest attempt at filmmaking","Sometimes in cinema it is difficult to live up to hype. However, Dhoom 3 exceeds all expectations by packing a solid punch. The start was excellent and emotional, propped up by great performances from Jackie Shroff and Sidharth Nigam, the kid who plays young Aamir. YRF were indeed fortunate to find a kid who is not only a gymnast but a talented actor. I thought the cruel bank guy was good in his small part. He should've got a longer part. After the hasty Iqbal (Jackie) commits suicide, his son decides to take revenge. He targets the bank using his circus tricks and incredible gymnastics.As good as Aamir acts, he gets a very good script here that gets the best out of him. The "dhoom" scenes i.e. the chases are awesome. Modern cameras and VFX effects make them even better.Aamir's acting gets better and better as the story progresses. This is one one hell of a job by Aamir, on par with his best works.*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****To be frank, ACP Jai Dixit has become a liability since Dhoom 2 because his character makes things redundant. Since Dhoom 2 had a happy ending, his pesky interruptions didn't matter. But in Dhoom 3 the ending is sad, just because they had to give leverage to his character. Alas! they miss out on many tricks. Sahir's mastery and the twists around his characters are so good that he could have easily toppled Jai. Alas! Jai's character needs face saving because he's supposed to be one of the principal characters. He comes across as a big time nuisance.The whole angle about Jai called by US police to help them is hard to fathom. But we understand it's "dhoom" and some level of cinematic liberty has to be taken to involve a story like this in Chicago because it's hard to visualize this story on the streets of India." 
" Worth Watching","I Just Completed Watching Dhoom:3 and I Must Say That They Try and Made Something Awesome To Us; Let Me Tell You 1st, It's Not a Typical Thief and Police Kinda Dhoom, It Was All About Revenge of His Father's Death. In a 170+Minutes I Didn't Got Bored(A Biggest Plus Point), A Very Interesting Twist Before Interval Just Tighten Us ie.Double Role of Amir Khan- I Have No Words The Way It Has Presented To Us(Sahir&Samar), Amir Carried Both Roles in Tremendous Manner,What We Expected From Him. What I Can Say About Katrina?? She is Being Used By As Usual As Material, This Time A Dancing & Acrobat Material. Well She Did Well Those Sequences, Abhishek Bachhan is Far Brilliant than His Previous Image As An Actor, Hats-off to Cinematographer, He Did Fabulous Job Well Chase Sequences Are Mind Blowing as far as Hindi Cinema's Concern Overall I'm Sure U Won't Get Bored for more than 5-10 minutes in a 170+Minutes Lengthy Movie" 
" Amazing experience","Awesome experience first time and only gets better later... There's sureshot expectation of popcorn entertainment from Dhoom franchise. This time it's even bigger in terms of story, direction and action. The stunts are of international standard.It not only strengthens the legacy but takes it to a higher level. In D1 and D2 John Abraham and Hrithik Roshan didn't have any backstory but here Aamir Khan has a backstory and a better characterisation.Spoilers ahead...It's unfair to pick one best Aamir Khan performance because he has given so many great performances. His work in Dhoom: 3 definitely finds place amongst his best work. He is restrained as Sahir and totally cute as Samar. At times Samar seems like a different actor.Bike on rope and the second heist are awesome. The third one is alright.The songs are superb. I always felt that Katrina Kaif didn't go berserk in 'ishq shava' song (jab tak hai jaan). In 'kamli' however she does very well, totally fits into the role.Overall it's a fantastic movie from start to end." 
" Entertainer of the year","An out and out entertainer. Vijay Krishna Acharya makes no mistakes this time and boasts this highly awaited franchise with an engaging script that makes the audience guessing till the very end. Death defying stunts especially with those bikes. Catchy dialogues. Spectacular sets that makes Dhoom: 3 a pulse rising chilling cop thief adventure that has a highly satisfying and spectacularly dazzling individual part of Aamir Khan that stays with you for long and asks repeat viewing. Vijay Krishna Acharya sticks to the basics shows his outmost loyalty to the genre dosen,t go for any layers and while he makes us jump out of our seats with those action shocks draws out those soft funny moments with finesse and even easily manages a touch of romance into the yarn with commendable ease. Technicalities are first rate. Sudeep Chatterjee cinematography is a treat to the eye. Editing by Ritesh Soni is crisp. Sumit Basu's production designing, Adri Siriwatt art direction is spectacular. Manoshi Nath, Rushi Sharma and Anaita Shroff costume designing is chic. Pritam Chakraborty music adds memento to the adrenaline rush. Title track, 'malang' and 'kamli' are a take home. Aamir Khan: you know how serious he is about his choices. And you know how really he works hard on his characters he plays. In Dhoom: 3 Aamir is in great shape and gives a brilliantly mature performance. His finesse to enter into the skin of the character is well known but here he as an actor/performer does to the franchise what a superstar should do- he demands a repeat viewing and that is the biggest USP of this installment. His fans and audience in general will go gaga. Katrina Kaif: boy she was never so delicious. The lass who has grown up tremendously as an actress has worked a lot for this and it shows. In 'Kamli' Katrina is bewitchingly sexy. Truly it's impossible to shift your eyes from her. Fabulous. Abhishek Bachchan: is in complete element and seems to be enjoying the fun. Highly entertaining. Uday Chopra: is very funny and successfully makes yo" 
" Hats off to Dhoom 3","I have become a huge fan of Aamir Khan after watching dhoom 3.A great epic entertainer with an engaging story, epic chases, sharp BMW stunts, fantastic acting and memorable music.The direction is very ambitious in a good manner deserving congratulations. Slow-mo scenes are well done and he draws good performances out of his cast. The interval point is simply brilliant. Every scene is shot with precision.The stunts, the chases involving the cop and Aamir are top class. Simply put, it's how a cat and mouse chase should be done.The pace slacks a little after interval. The whole thing at amusement park is a little fake. After a while things get back to good. The last crime isn't as compelling as the first two maybe because the cat is out of the bag by then. Strangely the final robbery isn't good in any Dhoom movie.My final word 9." 
" Aamir is the best... Dhoom 3 works big time","The kid who plays Aamir Khan's childhood is so damn good that he matches Aamir Khan in his memorable performance. He starts the movie with Jackie Shroff in superbly acted cameos by both. The movie is awesome from start to finish with thrilling action scenes. The antagonist (Aaamir Khan) has a better characterization compared to his predecessors in Dhoom. (Mind you, I am not saying that the older Dhooms were inferior. They all are good in their own way.)In my review I would like to address some of the criticism Dhoom 3 has received:Criticism 1: "How could the kid Sahir beat up grown up adults?"Explanation: He didn't beat them up. He merely deceives them with his nimble movements and acrobatics. After all he is a trained boy.Criticism 2: "Why does the kid Sahir start talking in Hindi with Anderson?" Explanation: He was tense. He was totally desperate for the bank's approval. For heaven's sake! he was a young kid, probably a new immigrant, not well versed in spoken English. In his nervousness he started rattling in Hindi.Criticism 3: "How could he ride a bike on rope? It's so unreal."Explanation: He is a circus artist. Modern circus players are capable of doing incredible feats on ropes. Bike on rope is far fetched but that's what an escapist entertainer is about. How about when James Bond drove an invisible car? How about when Uma Thurman killed 100 assassins with one sword in Kill Bill? Criticism 4: "How could the bike turn into a motorboat? That's unreal."Explanation: The same way how James Bond's car turned into a submarine. Bond uses gadgets. So does the wizard Sahir. Criticism 5: "Why didn't any CCTV cameras capture his face when he descended down the building?" Explanation: The same reason why Farhan Akhtar had shaved chest and eight-pack abs in Bhaag Milkha Bhag. In real life he wasn't muscular. (BMB was a biopic while Dhoom is fantasy). The same reason why Bhuvan didn't have a moustache in Lagaan. He should have had a moustache logically because it's customary in villages for men to have moustaches and it was a drought ridden area. How could he waste water on shaving his face? The reason he didn't have a moustache was because the director didn't like the character's look in it. It's called cinematic liberty. "Criticism 6: Why did American police need Jai Dixit's help?"Explanation: Now that's a fair criticism but how could they exclude Jai Dixit from Dhoom? People would have complained about not following the spirit of Dhoom. Besides, shooting stunts like these in India wouldn't have the same effect. Criticism 7: "It lacks the essence of Dhoom series." Explanation: Watch Dhoom 1 and Dhoom 2 again. Both films are poles apart in many ways. In same way, Dhoom 3 offers novelty. But in the end all 3 films carry the essence of Dhoom. Criticism 8: "Plagiarism! It is a copy of The Prestige!"Explanation: The magic trick is the same but what they have done out of it is completely different. If that similarity makes it a copy, then 99% of the films are inspired from cinema or real stories. Even Sholay, Inception, Irreversible were unofficially inspired from other films. Criticism 9: "It is a copy of Now You See Me"Explanation: That's absurd because Now You See Me came just 4 months before the release of Dhoom 3. Whereas Aamir Khan signed Dhoom 3 in 2011 and the shooting started in 2012 and finished early 2013.Criticism 10: "It unrealistic." Explanation: So are James Bond films, Dabangg, Ghajini, Spiderman, Superman, Sin City, Kill Bill etc. They are NOT meant to be realistic. For realism watch Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Shahid, Taare Zameen Par, Peepli Live etc.My score: 9/10" 
" awesomeness returns","Where do I start talking about a movie linked with very very precious childhood memories? From the first time John Abraham and gang motored on the streets on Mumbai to the cool Dhoom tune it become a sign of coolness. Later Hrithik Roshan's Dhoom 2 had its own flavour. It peeked into heists and gave us sweet romance in a light exploration of cop versus robber battle royale. Now comes the reliable Aamir Khan into the world of Dhoom. Like other Dhooms, the 3rd Dhoom charters its own path adding its own touches in making Dhoom an entertaining ride from the opening shot to the climax. Thankfully it's not a formulaic ride. It opens up new horizons with a great story and fresh action and Vijay K Acharya's style of storytelling.The bike scenes are gripping, well shot and edited. The visual effects team (based in India) does a swell job in the swell scenes also the dual role shots. My favourite scene is the biggie before the interval. It is very slick & old-school of Hitchcock.Like Dhoom the first there is no peek on robberies but the focus is on bike escapes. Aamir Khan suits the action parts really well. Salute to him for getting in right shape. Aamir Khan adds to his swell career of great films. (S)Well done again. The young boy Siddharth Nigam is fab:- a talented gymnast and a fab young actor. Jackie Dada is brilliant as usual.Kaif shares a small but good chemistry with Aamir Khan. I am gonna play devil's advocate for Abhishek Bachchan. He is an underrated actor but he needs to be modest. He has gotta be honest to himself and be thankful to Almighty that he is still getting to work with the actors like Ajay Devgan, Aamir Khan and SRK despite having a horrendous box-office record for 5-6 years. Uday Chopra is perfectly cast as Ali. He has some endearing moments and dialogues but like Dhoom 2 his is shadows but there is nothing that could have been done about it. He shines in his part. My rating:-) 9/10 (one extra 10/10 for Aamir Khan's cool act and the suspense factor)." 
" only mediocrity is safe - dhoom 3 ain't mediocre","Only mediocrity is safe. D3 could have been a safe affair but thankfully it is a daring adventure with great story and performances. The credit goes to the writer and director Vic Acharya for putting great action, bike scenes, mystery, important twists and emotions. Bande hai hum uske is a great poem repeated at important points in the movie. I won't write much about Aamir Khan because much has been said about his acting. He is simply brilliant in a very challenging role. Siddharth Nigam does a great job playing Aamir's childhood part. Watch him in the flashback after interval, you might drop a tear or two. Abhishek Bachchan looks tough and stern in a good depiction of Jai Dixit. Overall, a sharp entertainer.Story: 9 Direction: 10 Acting: 10 (Aamir, Sid Nigam, Jackie) Cinematography: 10 Bike action: 10 Songs: 8 BG Music: 10 Production Value: 10" 
" Dhoom Dham","It's a totally escapist world. While Dhoom 1 & 2 sought their style from Hollywood, Dhoom 3 looks back at 70s Hindi movies and fit it into the Hollywood style.I liked how they based the stunts around circus.Dhoom 3 is a perfect addition to the Dhoom series. I don't believe in comparisons because every Dhoom has a style of its own. This one doesn't miss out in any manner. If only, it is the best Dhoom of the series. I wonder if they should make another because it will be hard to top it.You have Aamir doing stuff he has never done before. He is totally cool in bike scenes and circus gymnastics.AB Jr and Uday Chopra are fine. Their characters extend from the earlier movies.Kat Kaif is a sensation. I am a fan of her dancing from now on. She doesn't have a long role but she is competent.All three bike adventures are superb. My favourites are the first two. The BG music deserves a special honour because it is so vital to the movie.Direction is brilliant. Vijay Krishna Acharya is a great talent. I hope his talent doesn't get wasted in this industry.The little Aamir is a treat to watch:- a one hell of an actor. It's amazing what children bring to be table because of their innocence and freeness.The best things:- direction, bike on rope, bike on bridge, aamir khan, kat kaif, bg music etc.Not so best things :- final robbery, climax because it's sad." 
" Well worth a watch - even with the sub-titles","I am not a movie critic or a good reviewer of films. I like what I see and this film was just great!!! Cheesy over the top but brilliant stunt sequences, absolute brilliant story line and excellent music and dancing. This is coming from a post punk muso with restricted mind for art.Seriously, I am not the most opened minded person in the world but I fell in love with all of the characters portrayed in this film from the cops to the villain(s).Katrina Kaif just added the whoa! factor but unfortunately her best performance was the ending credits.A long film for us "westies" but great entertainment - away from the norm - thanks :-" 
" A classical cop-n-robber tale with modern treatment and much more","The thing I like the most about Dhoom franchise is how different they are from one another while still carrying the spirit of cop-n-robber Dhoom world. In part 2 Hrithik Roshan (in a super cool act) was a master of disguise here in part 3 Aamir Khan (in another super cool act, keeping with the tradition of Dhoom) is a gymnast. So here he uses his circus gymnastics to dodge cops. The robbery scenes are superbly done. Like a circus gymnast he does great stunts on bike. He fits the part like fish to water. His childhood part is played by Siddharth Nigam (the discovery of the movie) at the start of the movie. Jackie Shroff and he set the scene and emotional moments very well. As audience we always support the so-called villains of Dhoom but in Dhoom: 3 we support Sahir more because of his past and later our support increases after the awesome twist.The only downside (if it can be called one) is that there are just three robberies. It would have been better to have one more robbery instead of the fight scene in India." 
" one of the best action thrillers ever","It is often said that Dhoom movies are action movies. If you think about it, like Aamir Khan also said, they are not action. They are more of adventure films with pulsating chases. There is little action or fight scenes in Dhoom. In the spirit of the riveting Dhoom world, the 3rd edition does a fantastic job. You know when Aamir is in the lead, things ought to get better. One has to understand that Dhoom is an escapist world, like the films of James Bond or action films of Salman Khan. It is a film in which you want to whistle. The last time I heard such loud whistles were during Dabangg and Ghajini. Every time Sahir pulled a fast one, crowd cheered loudly.Some people were asking how does Jai find him at the dam. The answer is: it doesn't matter. Either way, Samar would have contacted Alia and Jai would have caught him. Jai knew that he could use Alia to lure him. If he had Samar, Sahir would have automatically walked in. The chemistry between the characters is so amazing that they could have easily made it longer. The time of 172 minutes flies by." 
" Dhoom = Mega Action AUR Emotion","An engaging tale the story is set on the backdrop of Chicago and a bank is getting looted by a thief leaving a clown's mask. He is Sahir (aamir) who has a circus show and he also has a vengeance behind this act. From India come the duo of ACP Jai Dixit (abhishek) and Ali (uday chopra) to catch the thief. Meanwhile, Sahir is joined by the beautiful Aaliya (katrina) in his circus acts. Whether Jai and Ali are able to catch Sahir or not forms the rest of the story.The director has come up with a regular storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was quite absorbing. The dialogues were well written. The script was average but the screenplay made the whole difference. The background score was gripping and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was exceptional. Editing was crisp. Costumes were stylish and well designed to suit the royalty while the art department was fabulous. Aamir Khan has taken the film to a new level with his performance, Katrina was stunningly sexy and eye catching, Abhishek was good, Uday Chopra brought few smiles. Not much for the foreign actors. Jackie was brief but made his presence felt.This is the third edition of the Dhoom series and though there is nothing much in the plot or storyline it is the way the whole thing is packaged and presented that creates the difference. Right from the first scene there is a lot of energy and the interval twist is quite good. The second half also is engaging and though it slowed down a bit it picks up in the climax. Overall, this is a film which must be watched for its adventurous chases than content." 
" Man vs. Bank","Aamir Khan dons the helmet this time and sets on thrilling escapes. Chase is the buzz word in Dhoom. Instead of being called action films, Dhoom movies fit the description of adventure. There is an underlying socialist theme: the corporate domination, the exploitation of common people by banks, their arbitrary attitude, prejudice and so much. It's a circus guy's battle against a bank. A common man versus establishment. Three chases are almost enough. One more would have been better. It doesn't matter that they don't show how the banks were robbed. The chases are so well executed that it doesn't matter. The circus stunts during the chases are awesome. Full points for that.The suspense-buster scene is directed with sheer brilliance. Aamir makes it special with a great performance. ACP Jai Dixit has shades of gray. He too is a part of the "system" like Anderson and the bank. The ending is a sad commentary on our society, deeply moving with love between two brothers."
