" A Very Bad Bad Movie","I found this movie on Internet, Title was interesting, but movie was equally bad. Bad acting, Bad Direction, Bad Screenplay, Bad editing, the only nice thing I have to say about this movie is it's music and Story. Story was average but was handled very amateurishly. Anuj was very flat as if he was always in COMA expressionless face, I think Udita did this movie for money or relation, rest of the cast nothing to say anything. It's predictable story of a commando who is found at the wrong place at wrong time, rest of the film is mindless chase, with lots of twist which can be predicted as the film progresses Final word below average film avoid it." 
" Again one of the nonsense movies.","I really expected something new from this movie but it really disappointed me.This is only the wastage of the money and nothing else. Jag Mundhra(Director) after "Shoot at Sight" again with a poor concept, hurted us badly.There were some thing's in the movie which were not so bad like Scenery,Suspense,Thrill,Romance but what was really lacking was a good concept.Udita gives her best performance in every movie but yet there seems something lacking in her acting.Timing in the movie,music,Dialogues all were disgusting and i really felt bored after the intermission.Anyway,i am giving an advice to the Director that Plz make that kind of the movies which really effect the people and avoid these old concept because viewers are now fed up from these stories like many persons searching for truth and confusion in everything.Plz,i am not writing a spoiler,it is only my opinion and there is really not any rivalry.My rating for this movie is 3/10."
