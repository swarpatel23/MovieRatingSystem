" Uhm...","Where do I start? Fardeen Khan is easily one of the worst actors in Bollywood. Why do directors still give him roles when he hasn't done a performance worth remembering? Kareena was also bad! She screams herself silly in every second scene of project she participates in, an action unintentionally designed to make the audience go deaf. When she makes hideous faces at the camera every two minutes, you wish someone would make the burkha a mandatory covering for her visage.Both Kareena and Karisma started their careers as go-getting divas, but whereas the elder sibling has proved her mettle with unforgettable cinematic performances over the years, Kareena is all talk and little talent in this film. It wasn't until years later, Kareena started to do better films and improved in acting.I absolutely loved all the songs. The music is the best part of the film.All in all, if you're really bored and if you really need to kill some time then I suggest you see this otherwise I'd avoid it!" 
" Goofy, funny, film starring the most beautiful woman in Bollywood","OK, so this film is not a profound riff on human nature or a dazzling innovation in movie making, but so what? It is consistently funny in a dare-to-be-goofy way. Kareena Kapoor is clearly the most beautiful woman in the world (sorry, Aishwarya), and can be silly on camera without coming off as dim or unappealing. Fardeen Kahn is the perfect romantic and comedic foil for Bebo in this off-beat story. Amrish Puri is as good as you would expect, and he and Fardeen play off each other beautifully. The musical numbers are fun, sometimes sexy and sometimes too weird for words, but always entertaining. And isn't entertainment what Bollywood does so well? Lighten up! Have a little Kushi!"
