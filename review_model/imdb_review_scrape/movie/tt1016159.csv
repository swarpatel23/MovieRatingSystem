" A Film For Kids - Good One","The writers of this movie, Nupur Asthana and Jay Shewakramani, have done something special - a story with some message which can self motivate, not only just a child but also an adult.A thirteen year old orphan, Karan, dreams of playing cricket for his country, India. One day, he finds a bat which is has "KD 83." He finds out that this was the bat that the famous Indian player, Kapil Dev, used while playing in the 1983 world cup, which India won. He considers this as his magic bat and soon realises what he is able to do.No imagination has been left by the director, Kitu Salooja and the actors and especially the child artists, Zain Khan, Raj Bhansali and Deeptiman Choudhary, have done a magnificent job as have the adult actors, Rahul Bose and Rajesh Khera. But what made it even more enjoyable was that Kapil Dev, himself. makes an appearance as himself.This is an outright children's. movie and can be watched with family. But if you do not like cricket, then this is not the movie for you. I can only say that the director has used all possible imagination and it has made the movie worthwhile to watch and that has made it different from the others." 
" charming and endearing","Central character Karan believes in this film that there is some magic in his cricket bat. Similarly there is definitely some magic in treatment by débutant director Kituu Salooja that retains your interest till the end of the movie, which is no small thing in a non-star cast, non-romantic, modest budget film. It qualifies to be a light hearted, fun filled film that promises to break the barrier between the kiddie flick and the adult flick.Though the background is Cricket, but the film works more for the amazing chemistry, between 13-yr old débutant Zain Khan and Rahul Bose. Another plus point in film is it is devoid of any genre, so no overdose of melodrama, preachings (for kids) or dramatic moments. It is slick and crisp, plain, simple, fast paced, a 96-minute roller-coaster ride. On flip side though, there is scope in development of Climax. The track involving Rahul's strained relations with his father is also under developed. But that can be ignored, as it is a treat for whole family at the end of summer time." 
" An okay but forgettable movie for kids about believing in your dreams","A decent film for kids. It's much better than those pretentious kiddie movies like Krishh and Koi Mil Gayas but the fact that 'Chain Kulii Ki Main Kulii' is a ripoff isn't exactly an advantage. Karan (Zain Khan) is a young orphan who dreams of being a cricket player. However, living in an orphanage, it seems an impossible dream until one day he finds a bat, not just an ordinary bat but a magical one.This film has its share of flaws (which are many): The Hitler character was really annoying and the actor was pretty bad at playing the evil headmaster. It has it's share of melodrama (but then again it is targeted at the young audience). There are also many similarities to Nagesh Kukunoor's 'Iqbal' (which of course is a much better film). Zain Khan is alright (even though he goes a little over the top quite frequently and annoys). Rahul Bose is good but this isn't among his best work, mostly because the role doesn't have much to offer. It's nice that he did a kids movie (in spite of being known for his intense roles) and he takes a back seat as he allows more scope for the newcomer kid. Meera Vasudevan has a very small and insignificant role but it's nice to see her after a long time (if only the role was something of substance).So parents, uncles, aunts and whoever wants to enjoy a movie with their kids can give this forgettable film a go. Yes, you might enjoy it but it's not one you'd care to remember. Plus, I just didn't like that it was a ripoff, I mean, is it really that difficult to come up with an original idea?" 
" Kids will love it...","Plot- A 13 year old boy from an orphanage finds a magic bat and is chosen into the Indian cricket team.Kids are going to love this movie. Adults will probably find it easy going but nothing special.Parts which are amusing for adults are the jibes (which are gentle) directed towards the cricket team's current poor form. The kids are all right. Rahul Bose actually finds himself playing second fiddle throughout the film. There are a few flatulence jokes and mild bad language. One gripe- the shoddy cricket scenes. Not a single player in the Indian team (apart from Rahul Bose) looks like he deserves to be there, or is that intentional!!Bottomline: A watchable enough movie, specially for kids."
