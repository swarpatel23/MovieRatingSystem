" Pretty decent!","Well I must say I quite enjoyed the movie even though I was expecting it to be another one of those boring comedies with the same story line. Well the movie is a rip-off of There's Something About Mary. The whole plot and characters are similar. So I give it very low points for originality. But I have to admit, that although the storyline was not original, the jokes fitted into the story were pretty hilarious. Akshay Kumar has returned back to some really good acting after a terrible mess in Garam Masala. Paresh Rawal is well used in this film, along with some pretty good scenes from Sunil Shetty, Johnny Lever and other members of the film.I enjoyed it much much more than Garam Masala, and it really won't be a BIG waste of time if you go watch it. I'd recommend it if you really have the time. It is entertaining." 
" Silly...","Based on the 1998 American cult movie 'There's Something About Mary', Vikram Bhatt's 'Deewane Huye Paagal' is a silly film, that doesn't pay the correct homage to the film it adores.Remember Ben Stiller sterling performance in 'There's Something About Mary', Diaz's charm, the witty dialog placed wonderfully in the screenplay and super direction. Sadly, 'Deewane Huye Paagal' is a letdown by very silly jokes, characters, dialog and mediocre direction.The film begins ably, but loses energy 60-minutes in the film. The culmination is the biggest downer. It's plain bad. Bhatt is a pro when it comes to making Horror films, and after watching this film, your assured that Comedy isn't his favorite dish.In the acting department, Shahid Kapoor is mechanical. One could've never imagined that he would transform into a caliber that would even nod a film like 'Kaminey' and perform superbly. An actor who has taken Giant Strides! Akshay Kumar is over-the-top, but that's the demand of the character. Sunil Shetty is good. Rimi Sen looks stunning and plays her part nicely. Paresh Rawal hams. Johnny Lever is his usual self. Vijay Raaz stands out, a true scene-stealer. Vivek Oberoi's interpretation of a Narrator is an eye-sore.On the whole, not much left to talk about. Verdict: Strictly Average!" 
" Jokes picked up from 'Something About Marry' Straight Up!!","If you haven't watched 'There's Something About Marry' then you might enjoy this lame movie .... Lame because every joke is lifted directly off 'Something About Marry'.Seems like nothing original is left in Indian film industry (or may be very little). Stay away from this piece of junk, watch 'There's Something About Marry' and you'll laugh throughout the movie. After watching the original you can watch 'DHP' just to compare how cheesy it is!! Its sad to see that good actors like OM Puri are working in such movies. As far as other actors are concerned they are ordinary actors not like Amir or Shahrukh who like to work in quality movies only." 
" a really funny movie!","I was really excited when I heard about Deewane Huye Paagal because it is the sequel to Awara Paagal Deewana, which is one of my favorite comedies, so I couldn't wait to see it. And I'll tell you that when I did, I thought it was hilarious!! The story is nicely developed, and even though there are a lot of characters, somehow, the plot never becomes confusing.Performances, out of all the actors, were very good! Akshay Kumar is great, once again, and you find yourself laughing out loud at the way he acts and his dialogues! Shahid Kapoor plays the character of a very shy and innocent guy well, and he's easy to root for in the movie. I can't say anything specifically about Rimi Sen except that she was good. Sunil Shetty proves that he can do comedy. I loved his character and all of his dialogues. And last but not least, one of the funniest actors around, Paresh Rawal, is wonderful once again! Awara Paagal Deewana and Deewane Huye Paagal-both very fun comedies!" 
" Worth It","I would say Paresh Rawal repeated his acts from Awara Pagal Dewana.Best performance in the movie was by Vijay Raz I think. Johnny Lever after a long time was not given much scope. Akshay Kumar was 1st rate in comedy. I have not watched SOMETHING ABOUT MARRY but everyone told me that the story of this flick is lifted from that Hollywood Movie. Which is nothing new. Vikram Bhatt's Awaara Pagal Dewana was also inspired from Hollywood's "The Whole 9 Yards". Still I liked it. Garam Masala and this cannot be compared as Priyadarshan makes Comedies on error. Which is lovely style in Bollywood. Vikram Bhatt did well but Songs were Just about OK. Anu Malik's singing is not what i look forward to." 
" There Is Something About Tanya","Despite being an Indianized version of There Is Something About Mary, DHP is a really entertaining film. So, you get the idea of the story.Akshay Kumar is really good in the film. Paresh Rawal is also good, but not as much as he was in Awara Paagal Deewana or Hera Pheri. Shahid Kapoor and Rimii Sen give decent performances. Johnny Lever and Vijay Raaz are good in their supporting roles. Good to see Johnny Lever back in his comedic form.But it is Suniel Shetty who is the surprise packet in DHP. Good see him in a good role. He makes the best use of it. He has plenty of scenes where he manages to raise some of the biggest laughs.On the whole, DHP is a thoroughly enjoyable entertainer. Good doses of comedy, gloss, music and stunts." 
" One real bad remake","I walked out of the film, i paid 9 dollars to watch one of the years worst comedies. The acting was horrid in the film. Akshay Kumars excessive crotch banging and Sunil Shetty's horrible portrayal of Tucker from something about Mary would make anyone wan to walk out. This is definitely the worst American remake ever. The songs weren't even original one was the beat of Kevin Littles hug me hug me and the other of jazzy b's dil lutiya. The best song would be the remix of Chakle Chakle, thats it and it might be stolen too. I walked into the theater thinking this should be good because its the Hera Pheri cast, but two hours into it i stopped hoping for something funny and original to come out. I say watch the film on DVD, you might even think you've wasted your money there." 
" Best comedy film of 2005","I enjoyed this watchable film it was so hilarious there was lots of good action good comedy and good actingAkshay Kumar is excellent as the funny hero Shahid did wellActress did good in her movie Other were much decent My rating 10/10 or 5/5 *****\***** or **********\**********" 
" Karan loves Tanya ,but here is also the gang of mad lovers who can do anything to win Tanya's heart.Here is a don who has his own agenda.","PERFORMANCES: Akshay,Paresh,and Sunil are excellent in their roles.But , Shahid hasn't much to do and Rimi also. In supporting cast there is Johny Lever( not really funny),OmPuri ,but they are not funny.DIRECTION and STORY: After Awara Paagal Deewana(2002) Vikram Bhatt's direction is average this time but he handles the weak story well.Story is not new but have good comic elements. FINAL VERDICT: If you have watched Awara Paagal Deewana ,watch this one also for good entertainment. BEST SCENES:(1) watch out for the first meeting of Sunil and Paresh in film you will guaranteed a laugh.(2) watch where Akshay tells Shahid about Rimi's marriage." 
" Movie was just too irritating","If you haven't watched 'There's something about Mary', you might enjoy the story of the movie. Only the 'scientist' variable is an added component to the story.Akshay was too irritating after the first 15 minutes of his intro. But I was impressed with Johnny Lever's comedy rather than Paresh Rawal.There are too much off unnecessary stunts in the movie, which is plainly meant to show off and does not add anything to the movie scenario.But I was impressed that they did not take a complete rip off of the original movie, but made a few stitches in the movie." 
" Deewane Paagal Nahi Hue","After the success of APD, The team Akshay, Suneil, Aftab(cameo), Paresh Rawal, Music Director Anu Malik, Producer Firoz Nadiadwala and Director return with Deewane Huye Paagal. The film is a remake of There's Something About Mary(1998) which is a cult comedy and very famous in Hollywood, In fact earlier it was remade in Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat(2001) by Rajiv Rai but he changed it into a romantic film and it flopped, Vikram Bhatt however keeps it a comedy. Vikram Bhatt is known to make remakes, his most films were remakes. The film released in 2005 just few weeks after the success of GARAM MASALA when Akshay Kumar's comedies were successful but surprisingly it failed to work. Perhaps the promotions gave people an indication that it was an out n out comedy but because it was a romantic comedy it didn't work? The film starts off on a slow note, the initial scenes are hardly that good and the irritating narration of Vivek Oberoi is painful, The fun starts once Akshay is introduced. Compared to that film, Here Vikram Bhatt adds lot of action, more slapstick comedy and song and dance. There are some scenes copied same to same like the dog scenes which are not too funny in recreation, There also add a new character of Paresh Rawal,Johny Lever which weren't there in the original. Some scenes are funny like Akshay's escapades, The scene when the truth is revealed of characters and the chaos But the added subplot of Suresh Menon, Om Puri doesn't really evoke mirth In fact the comedy at several portions is too slapsticky and the ending focuses more on action like APD and the end just like the original but more overdone is okay.Direction by Vikram Bhatt is good Music by Anu Malik is good, Chakle Chakle which is a copy of an English song is okay, It's sung by Anu Malik and he is good Anu Malik also lends his voice for Mere Jaane Jigar and sings superbly The best song is Aisi Umar MeinAkshay Kumar dominates the show, Unlike in APD where Paresh dominated He does a superb job in a comic role, Those days Akshay Kumar's comic bone was getting utilised a lot after the success of MSK and Garam Masala. Shahid Kapur is decent but is mostly overshadowed by others. Rimii Sen is annoyingly dubbed and doesn't look good, blame it on her make up and all she doesn't look fit for the role, but her acting is okay Suneil Shetty overdoes his walking to add to the fun of the character but he does provide some funny moments. Paresh Rawal gets some funny scenes but it's nothing great unlike in APD. Johny Lever is funny, but irritates at times Suresh Menon annoys, Om Puri is as usual, Supriya is funny Asrani and other sre okay" 
" Below average compared to the original...","While it is not a complete ripoff of the Hollywood blockbuster from Farrelly brothers (There is Something about Mary), it is largely based on it. The whole Ompuri/Magic formula angle does not work and is totally unnecessary. However the biggest annoyance is Vivek Oberoi popping in and out at the narrator (played by the Farrelly brothers themselves in the original). Similar material would have been gold in Priyadarshan's hand. Akshay and Paresh Rawal are the only performers of any notice in the movie, rest of the cast is poor to average in terms of performance. Shahid Kapur was particularly disappointing playing the role Ben Stiller played in the original, no laughs for him at all!! Anu Malik is no longer the music director he once was a decade or so ago, he has not delivered a knockout soundtrack in ages. Overall it might be best to re-watch the original; a definite miss for everyone who is not a hard-core Akshay Kumar/Paresh Rawal comedy fan." 
" Audience hue Pagal","One of the horrible movie I have ever watched. I saw this movie in Mumbai, my last ever picture in Mumbai. I paid Rs. 200/- to watch the movie and the movie wasn't worth 25/- even.Akshay hams too much in the movie so are Sunil, Paresh & all others. The only saving grace of the movie was Rimi Sen who was fresh out from Dhoom then. She certainly is improving film after film. She was good in Hungama. She plays the same kind of role. In Hungama there were two guys after her. In this movie, there are seven characters who are after her. I don't want to waste my time writing review of the movie coz there is no story altogether.A must skip." 
" Complete Rip off of "Something about Mary"","my title says it all. This movie is funny and good to pass time with but the constant rips of S.A.M keep u turned off. Hollywood need to start suing Bollywood for all its rip off even if those rips and originals both suck. "Akshay Kumar has returned back to some really good acting after a terrible mess in Garam Masala. Paresh Rawal is well used in this film, along with some pretty good scenes from Sunil Shetty, Johnny Lever and other members of the film." is true as said by other user also true is was said about "SUNIEL SHETTY WAS AMAZING LIKE PARESH RAWAL. HE MOVES HIS THAT NO ONE CAN MOVE BODY LIKE HE DID. THAT WHY HE IS A MACHO MAN OF BOLLYWOOD AND KING OF TOP ACTION." also written by other user I'm doing this to make up the stupid 10 line rule complete BS."
