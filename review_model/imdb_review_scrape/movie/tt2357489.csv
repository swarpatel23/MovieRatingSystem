" Please stop making disrespectful remakes of our reputed classics.","Talking about this latest addition in this questionable trend of re- visiting the Classics, it will be a big disrespect towards Prakash Mehra, Amitabh Bachchan, Pran & Jaya Bachchan's original ZANJEER if I even go for writing a few paragraphs on this Apoorav Lakhia's ridiculous version. So instead of a review I will mention some great features of this well publicized project and then you can decide on your own that whether you wish to take it as a description of a film or a JOKE loudly cracked by its makers in a proud style.1. The film opens with a long credits song showing a half naked lady, which straight away puts you off as far as the excitement factor is concerned. 2. Within next three minutes you have a fight sequence of Ram Charan with the background music of "Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram" going in a vague manner, which keeps on playing in the entire film as if its a patriotic venture made by the likes of Jha. 3. Priyanka Chopra enters with dance sequence in the Pinki song, whereas in the script she is supposed to be a well educated NRI girl visiting India for a friend's marriage. 4. Including the credits track, the film features five songs before the interval quite absurdly. 5. Prakash Raj plays Teja in his repetitive style and Mahie Gill is Mona playing it like a silly girl knowing only one thing, i.e. Mona aur Sona (Completely clueless why did she even opt for it in the first place). 6. In one scene of the film, both Teja & Mona are sitting on a couch watching the original ZANJEER scenes of Ajeet and Bindu together. And here Mahie (Mona) says to Teja (Prakash Raj), "Tumhara Chehra Is Teja Se (Ajeet) Kitna Milta Hai?????" Indeed a great insightful thought in a remake. 7. In another scene Mona comes in with a tablet pack for Teja on which its written VIGRA. 8. Sher Khan (Sanjay Dutt) deals in stolen cars and a garage doing their makeovers?? 9. Both Vijay (Ram Charan) and Sher Khan (Sanjay Dutt) are shown playing play station games sitting on the same couch in one scene. 10. One of the most bizarre sequences in the film is when Ram Charan straight away drives his car into the slum crashing into people's homes and crushes them blindly like a mad man. Now he is a suspended ACP who does not really care that there are poor people including old, women, children and animals too living in that congested slum area. And he drives a good distance right into the slums with bombs exploding side by side????? 11. In the climax scene, when Teja's hand is covered by his shirt's sleeve then he simply pulls it up deliberately so that Vijay can see the tattoo on his arm and remember his parents murder! 12. Moreover, what can be said about the below average mediocre qawaali which has been added on the lines of the incomparable "Yaari Hai Imaan Mera" so lavishly. 13. Last but not the least, there is one particular dialogue in the film which is disgustingly written in a cheap manner just to bring in that kinky humor pointing towards the sexual relationship between Teja and Mona, which I find highly disgraceful to even mention in this write-up very frankly.Reading the above mentioned points myself, I don't think there is anything else required to write about this complete avoidable movie made by a questionable creative team. Putting it bluntly, this is not the work of any film-makers to be precise, but only a planned marketing product by some businessmen who are just looking for a project to get them fair returns. And in the process, they damn care about any respect for the original or creative aspects of the remake which is clearly visible throughout the film till the end.Anyway, what disturbs me the most after watching such nonsensical and not-required kind of remakes is the impact they are bound to make on the current generation, who haven't watched those famous original classics ever before. To give you a clear idea, just try to imagine what would come to the minds of young boys & girls in the age group of 16-30 years, after watching this brainless new age version of ZANJEER?Unarguably they would think that, "Was this the one movie which turned the 'not-in-demand' Amitabh Bachchan into the 'much-in-demand' angry young man of the 70s?". And "Was this the movie which became a cult hit, making way for a new trend in that decade, without having anything substantial in its storyline, content or execution?"No doubt there questions all seem to be logical but the point is that, "Who would make them aware of the painful anguish felt in the eyes of its original characters in Prakash Mehra's version of the 70s?" "Who would make them aware of the landmark confrontation scenes between Vijay and the delightful Sher Khan in a fabulous get-up? "Who will make them feel the subtle romance between the helpless Jaya and Vijay?" "Who will introduce them to the cunning enigma enjoyed for years around Ajeet and Mona Darling?" "Who will bring forward the "real friendship" depicted on screen in those years so impressively?" and "Who will make them listen to the memorable ageless track, "Yaari Hai Imaan Mera, Yaar Meri Zindagi" which still forces all to dance and feel the magic of music and relationships together?"I hope somebody takes that step and brings back the magic once again on the silver screen soon. May be, by taking an initiative of organizing "Exclusive Classics Festivals" at some selected theaters like they used to in the 80s. But even if it doesn't happen, we still have got our DVDs at home, so please spare us and stop making such disrespectful remakes of all our loved, reputed classics." 
" Disappointing movie","This movie was a total let down--about 2 hours of this movie is just watching the ACP beat up everyone and that is supposed to portray the "angry young man" part. This movie seems to assume that everyone watching it has actually watched the original Zanjeer. So, if like me, you haven't watched it you're wondering whats so special about Sher Khan. And you are also left wondering why his name seems to be the best bet out of the millions of criminals in Mumbai, to be the one responsible for the oil mafia incident. And then you are even more bewildered when the ACP turns up at Sher Khan's office and they both start fighting without having said a word (like it was a pre-ordained thing!). The editing of the movie should have been better as twice during one of Monas songs you have ample opportunity to see her innerwear. Mona plays the vapid woman of the deadly oil mafia Teja (played by Prakash Jha). In the whole movie, his acting is the best. He plays the part of the villain effortlessly.The character of Mala, played by Priyanka Chopra is a minor one. She is first involved in the whole movie because she saw a murder and then after having spent a night at the ACPs house decides that she;s fallen in love with him. Of course in Hindi movies one doesn't always expect logical succession of thoughts but her falling in love is super instant. Priyanka Chopra is too old to play this chatty, twenties sort of girl who just keeps jabbering like a teenager. Definitely not worth spending 3 hours over." 
" Very Very Lame","After seeing this movie I don't get it why such good actors and veterans such as Sanjay Dutt would do this movie seriously whatever the reason maybe it was a waste of their time. The newbie actor should have been given a much better intro than this movie. The writer whatever he wrote wasn't bad enough that the director took the remains of the lameness and sealed up the movie. The direction was very amateur remaking of a classic movie I think that the original makers of the movie must have just fainted. I need to ask the director myself that in the movie where Ram Charan first encounters with Sanjay Dutt without no reason Ram goes to Sanjay's place and starts fighting like did he have some sort of a preminition or what???? I mean what was that??? that's not direction that a huge flaw. There are many scenes that don't just add up and the whole movie was just a very waste of time. Two item songs were provided which obviously were thought that they will keep the ball rolling but they failed pathetically as for even an item song to go along the story and direction need to support the whole movie. The rest best of luck to the new actor Ram as you really need to make sure and pick your scripts by really getting into character I know I don't need to teach your acting but this is just a tip but for the director you need to still go through some more direction courses." 
" Zanjeer-The torment of my life","Just when you thought that there is some good left in the world, the movie Zanjeer punches you hard and brings you face to face with the disastrous disaster of Hindi Cinema. Pushed by circumstances ,in my case an exam of General Pharmacology, one usually goes to a place faraway and happy, also dark, and so did I. My friends and I, we ended up in a theatre. Wasn't zero cars in the parking, or no people in the vicinity or the lifelessness of the Theatre enough to scare us off? Obviously Not.One ticket worth 130 Rupees, and we barged into a hall full of nothing but an ogre-face sprawled all over the large screen. That was the defining moment when we knew that the coming 3 hours of our lives were in vague danger, but being a Desi breed we didn't turn back. 130 Rupees ka sawal tha.The initial shock of an atrociously hideous protagonist or an awfully dumb Priyanka Chopra was nothing. There was so much more they had in store for the scanty audience.A hag-faced Sanjay Dutt who insisted on wearing nothing but colours that could sore your eyes for a century, a nauseating woman named Mona, a dark and gross villain with massive one-liner-failures, a dizzy sound- track, a horrific and passé story-line, a dance step that looked pretty much like an epileptic seizure, a 150-minutes-of-my-life-never-coming- back later here I am thanking the almighty that I am alive. Barely.Only one bearable ending could've come out of this traumatic movie, if that mutant-lips-cop shot himself in the end, and the screen splattered with his pathetic blood. Or not. No way on Earth can this be a better movie, because this is it, the worst movie I have watched in my lifetime. I am scarred for life. Rating this movie in stars? I wouldn't rate this in bullshits." 
" headache","Its not worth spending even 2 hours. I don't know, what do people think for making such movies. Priyanka is also disappointing with her choice of movie and performance in the same. And who is that hero, I do not know the name exactly, he is not looking like a hero from any angle. Such kind of movies are spoiling the bollywood's image on people. Bollywood should ban these kind of movie. Even censor board should not allow such crap to release,because its not worth spending a single penny. For a case, if someone give me 1000 rs and ask me to watch, I would voluntarily deny the offer. many critics has given zero rating to this movie, which i think high rating for this movie." 
" This is an Era of Bad Remakes","After super success of Agnipath remake and failure of Himmatwala it is the turn of Zanjeer to continue this remake culture.To execute the original same plot in modern style is not at all easy.Himmatwala had entered its name in worst remake record books and Zanjeer too makes an attempt to reach at par with Himmatwala but fails due to some entertainment quotient.Only few entertaining scenes manage to save it from sheer embarrassment.To talk of the performances Ram charan has strong hold on the screen but you won't say wow after watching him till the end..Prakash raj is good but monotonous as always..Priyanka and Sanjay dutt are just fine..Apoorva lakhia's direction and screenplay is commendable but weak script, and bad execution overshadow it.All in all a poor remake with performances far below expectations.Its better to wait and watch Zanjeer on TV than wasting your precious money in multiplexes.I rate it 4 out of 10" 
" The isn't Zanjeer we wanted! Sanjay Dutt is the Saving Grace","It's clear that Bollywood wants to make Quick Money by Making Remakes . They Practically Screwed this Remake. I believe that Ram Charan is a Great Actor. He tried but debuting in a Bollywood movie which is a remake of a classic is stupid. Priyanka Chopra is a great actress we saw her in Barfi but does she have to shed clothes and be an arm candy in the movie? Why? Prakash Raj is Stereo-typed. Mahie Gill must watch her Previous movies and learn acting. The Only Good thing in the Movie is Sanjay Dutt. He does a Fab job but sadly his Screen time isn't that much which is BAD!!The Story is hammed. the Direct by Apoorva Lakhia is below average. the Music isn't great.The action is good.Overall, A Below Average fare." 
" It has the potential to damage the dimension of cinema..garbage","Zanjeer 1973 propelled Amitabh Bachchan's career also it brought into existence "angry young man". How on earth, Apoorva Lakhia decided to remake this iconic movie and played with its novel values. It is just a crisscross of all the elements required to make a movie and the results are gauche, tiresome and mediocre. 'Zanjeer' is about.C.P Vijay Khanna (Ram Charan) who is transferred from Hyderabad to Mumbai (Note: He has been transferred 17 times in merely 5 years). He teams up with the murder witness Mala (Priyanka Chopra) and investigates the murder. All these investigations connect the dots to the oil mafia Mogul (Prakash Raj). Vijay tries to expose Teja, but in process he gets suspended.Although story is the exact mock-up of Zanjeer (1973) but it is no match. It insults the cult scene between Amitabh & Pran in the police station; the fight between them is obnoxious, Priyaka-Ram Charan romance track is flat, Prakash Raj-Mahi Gill look unbearable and vulgar.Ram Charan reprising Bachchan's role as Vijay Khanna, who tries really hard to get the Angry Young Man avatar but fails absurdly. He couldn't flex his facial expressions according to the role however; he sustains the only one facial expression throughout. Sanjau Dutt looks ridiculous & indifferent as Sher Khan; it is definitely no match to iconic Pran. He does not share any chemistry with Ram Charan as both look distant. Priyanka's character, NRI Mala, is intended to add some comic reliefs which are banal. She performs "Pinki Item Song" in her facebook friend's wedding and witnesses a murder and start living with Ram Charan. It does not give any reason behind the love story also any emotional grounds.Prakash Raj is doing the same thing over and over again which is intolerable now and he also dresses like a ring master of any circus. Mahi Gill only does "MEOW", what a waste of such talented actress.Unfortunately, I do not have an Idea what was Atul Kulkarni doing? I don't remember any song of the movie but inappropriately used "Rghupati Raghav Raja Ram" track during fight sequence, which was atrocious.It is high time, such nonsense should be stopped. 2.8/10" 
" boring","well Zanjeer came with a lots of hype but received pale comments.coming to the story vijay khanna is a man of courage and will filled with sincerity makes his 23rd transfer in his five years from Hyderabad to Mumbai faces troubles,while Priyanka chopra was a n.r.i who visits Mumbai for her friend's marriage and unfortunately sees a murder.hence she meets Vijay and situations tends her to become a witness and so locks up here without returning to the u.s.Vijay starts the case chasing it up to prakashraj and the rest you have to watch it in the theater.despite the trailers and promos the movie went with a poor slow screenplay making it bore.in his rivalry with the villain every critic catches the point that hero is out of his laws and process till his victory then how can the movie justify only the director should know!. the one and only plus point is ramcharan's acting and so prakashraj's.sorry that this Telugu mega power star made his Bollywood debut as unmemorable.besides all the other crafts went disturbed.songs were good but non of the song was full in the movie.it was a perfect script and direction failure maybe running short of ideas.there is no perfect connections and logic's between the scenes and characters respectively.as there is no scope for comedy the viewers who expect it should return homes very disappointed.we should wait and see how much this movie can run for the box office collections." 
" I left it after 30 mins!","You cannot help but see this movie with the real Zanjeer playing in your mind. That's because a lot of dialogues are the same or near-about's, and boy what a disappointment, or should I say, disgrace to the real movie. The hero looks very rigid and tries hard to look angry, but he could very well be a side-kicks of hero's from the previous generation of bollywood hero's. Those guys had style, presence, commitment. Then comes the horrible dances and forgettable songs that almost every bollywood movie seems to thrive on. They all seem to copy each other, hence they look all the same. Who can even come near to a Bindu, or a Kalyanji-Anandji bongo music, or do a Pran? Still you would want to give the new movie a chance and see how it fares, but alas, I had to leave it after 30 mins otherwise I would have ended up having a headache." 
" Failed remake attempt","With out comparing the classic Zanjeer, if we watch this movie, its a series of blunders. Ram charan tej was pale and does not have any emotions in this acting. Very weak story line and narration is worst. Overall its a series of mistakes and tests patience of audience.Vijay Khanna (Ram Charan) is an honest cop who keeps getting transferred to different districts and finally he is put in Mumbai. Meanwhile, Mala (Priyanka) is an NRI who comes to Mumbai to attend a wedding. She becomes witness to a murder and this brings her to Vijay. He gives her shelter in his home and the murder leads him to the Oil mafia baron Teja (Prakash Raj). A clash erupts between Vijay and Teja. In this, Vijay is helped by his friend Sher Khan (Sanjay Dutt) and media person Jayadev . How things take shape forms the rest of the story." 
" Not a special One...!!!","This movie , i saw as first day first show.. but i felt nothing great here. Ram Charan is my favorite hero but sometimes story like this very judge able... can make u upset... acting of hero is good,also Sanjay dutt too...Priyanka chopra acted very nicely.. All actors done their job well.... That is a good point of the movie. I love to see Mr.Prakash has Villon .No big curiosity in the movie...totally action type one....Priyanka chopra's dance was good. All actors done their job perfectly good.... That is a good part of the movie. I like to see Mr.Prakash rai has Villon .The movie has good moral to say to the public. Fighting's are good." 
" Masala Flick Zanjeer 2.0","There is nothing in the movie that is worth watching.The story is completely changed when compared to the old zanjeer. The story could have been better or the movie time could have been reduced to make the movie interesting. At some time you feel quite bored.The story could have been better, it is just a masala flick. The movie becomes interesting and then all of a sudden movie slows down. Prakash Raj and Mahie Gill's acting is good and the dialogues of Prakash Raj are good.The acting of Bollywood debutant Ram Charan failed to live up to the expectations.So it is nothing good worth watching and the whole film is just average.Watch the movie only when you have nothing to do." 
" good and perfect story","Everything is perfect..but people don't get inspired seeing the reality.The narration is perfect ram charan suited very well for the character. Don't see the rating of the movie & decide to watch it.. because everybody's brain don't think in d same & may not like the same. its a very good story. RamCharan Teja makes an impressive Bollywood debut. We can safely say he is the man among the boys. Nice film. Ramcharan performance excellent. speedy film. has to be watched for sure.people never give good rating to the reality...Congrats to the hero charan for the Bollywood entry with a very good story of reality. keep going cherry .A version of 'Raghupati raghav...' plays in the background its really very good.The film has a happy Bollywood ending with the triumph of good over evil." 
" Not groundbreaking, but never was meant to be.","Let's be honest: Zanjeer is actually a pretty good film if you choose to look past its flaws (too many songs and some dialogue delivery) and instead focus on the positives (great action and decent performances). I actually had a good time watching the film. It was exactly what it was supposed to be: a full-on spicy action film featuring another angry young cop. Although it's a remake and I actually haven't seen the original yet, I can say it has made me excited about the original Zanjeer since it released in a time these cop actioners were instant blockbusters.The reason why this new Zanjeer was panned is possibly because no one wanted a classic remade. I can understand that, especially when the original was a smash hit. Also, this remake released in the wrong time to be honest. The original turned out to be a trendsetting film due to which the "angry honest cop takes on a criminal" story was reused again and again in Indian movies over the years, diluting the freshness of the subject over time. Zanjeer is not a surprising or great film, but is adapted pretty well as per modern standards.Action is what is offers the best. Great fight sequences, destruction, explosions and what not: this is exactly the film's USP and all the action feels even more impactful due to the presence of Telugu superstar Ram Charan. I'm a big fan of him and thus I could realize his voice was dubbed but actually pretty well. Priyanka Chopra, Sanjay Dutt, Prakash Raj, Mahie Gill and Atul Kulkarni have also given good performances according to their characters. VFX is adequately handled. The emotional scenes involving Vijay are really touching and impressive.All in all, this is a good action film to watch with a tub of popcorn. It's definitely not as bad as what most people tend to think, although I understand why exactly they do so, something I'll understand even better when I check out the original soon.Verdict: Not the best but still a gripping, entertaining cop action film. 4/5 stars." 
" Crap remake of Zanjeer","When I heard that Apoorva Lakhia one of the bad filmmakers of Bollywood is remaking Zanjeer I was taken aback First of all there is nothing left to remake in that film, The plot has been done to death over the years, In fact Kurukshetra which released in 2000 too had a similar plot, Strangely in that film Mukesh Rishi played Pran's role while Sanju who plays Pran's role in this film played the lead. Let me come to the basics: Zanjeer was not a classic but was different when released though it's flashback plot was similar to Yaadon Ki Baraat released that year, yet the film was pathbreaking because the hero had no songs, he fought for justice.etc but today things have changed. Apoorva Lakhia has done lot changes though keeping some scenes, dialogues and also the narrative at times same, In that film Jaya's role was simple here it's played by Priyanka Chopra who comes from foreign to dance at a facebook friend's wedding....Yes right! Here the villain runs an Oil Mafia In that film, Pran's fight scene with Big B came earlier while here it's shown later but lacks the impact. The film starts well but stagnates soon, The scenes are hardly impactful, the Zanjeer reprised dialogue from the original looks pitifully duplicated. Some scenes are well handled like Vijay's clash with Prakash Raj but lack the same impact of the original. In fact the director seems relying on the original's stature to carry forward this film but sadly it falters even as a standalone film. In the original, we had Om Prakash tiping Big B, here his role is replaced by Atul Kulkarni A Journalist.The Mona scenes with Teja try too hard to be funny but end up being crude with sexual overtonesDirection by Apoorva Lakhia is nothing great Music is forgettable, The last song in credits is perhaps for audience to remember how great was the original.Ram Charan tries very hard, he has a good presence, but gives a very ordinary performance, he is mostly seen frowning and hardly impactful Priyanka Chopra overdoes the role, Sanjay Dutt has a brief role and does his part well, though not as impactful as Pran, In the last scene his voice is dubbed perhaps it was added later-on and he didn't dub for it Amongst rest Aditya Lakhia, Dayashankar Pandey are okay, Prakash Raj is getting repetitive and does his role in the same style of his earlier films and lacks the impact required to carry off the role. Mahi Gill overdoes her role, Atul Kulkarni is wasted"
