" Mediocre Debut","Unlike other choreographers who attempt direction with dance or action themed films, Ganesh Acharya attempts to handle a love story between a happy go lucky guy and a physically challenged girl. The attempt however, falls flat on its face with a predictable storyline, mediocre acting and loose screenplay.Abhay is a happy go lucky guy (though it comes across more like a naive man-child) who ends up spending two years in jail after killing a man in a road accident. When he comes out of jail, his family and friends shun him. He decides to contact the family of the deceased man where too he is shunned. During the visit, he sees the paralytic daughter, Sonal, of the man who is kept in a secluded room by her brother. He is smitten by her and starts visiting her regularly (though one wonders why). Sonal has a caretaker but no one pays her any attention, infact she is probably only alive because the property is in her name. Abhay starts bonding with Sonal and tries to find ways to treat her condition. Turns out she was undergoing her treatment earlier, but that stopped when her father died. Then one day he takes her to meet his family and post being shunned by them, declares his love for her (which comes pretty much out of the blue, because there isn't any real romantic chemistry between them through out the movie). She of course, is already in love with him. Then on her birthday they decide to consummate their love and are caught in the act by Sonal's brother. Since, Sonal is not able to speak and record a statement, it is assumed that Abhay was raping her and is framed under those charges.The hero Abhay goes through the formulaic dance and action sequences and Sonal too joins in a couple of dream sequences where she dances in fields, rains, mountains etc. however, the audience would find it difficult to relate with these characters because of impact-less acting.While the story plot had the potential, the shoddy presentation just kills it. The music too is just passable with only Aye Khuda (sung by Sukhvinder Singh) having some energy."
