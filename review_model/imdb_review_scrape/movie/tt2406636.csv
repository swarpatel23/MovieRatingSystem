" The Worst Horror Film I Have Ever Seen.","What's the matter with Mr. Ram Gopal Varma? Surely a man who once directed cult films like Shiva (1989), Raat (1992), Satya (1998), Kaun? (1999), Bhoot (2003) & Phoonk (2008) can do better than this.But since then his directing capability is seriously in doubt. I think he should refrain from directing any more films and stick to producing them instead.Plot of film: it is about a spirit of a girl(or entity) that lives in a house and likes to possess the body of any child that it makes contact with.We see Tarun, an architect, moving into a luxurious bungalow with his wife, Namrata, and their children, 10-year-old Taman and 6-year-old Nimmi. During an exploration of the house, Nimmi finds a doll, and includes someone named 'Shabbu' in all her activities. The family mistakes Nimmi's new doll to be Shabbu but are surprised when Nimmi points to an empty space and introduces her invisible friend as Shabbu. Her parents suspect her wild imagination as the reason for her new 'friend'.Soon, Tarun's younger sister, Pooja, surprises the family with a visit. As Tarun, Namrata and Pooja discuss Nimmi's fixation over Shabbu, the family servant, Laxman, is sure of a spirit's presence in the house. Laxman's worries receive severe backlash from Tarun, an ardent rationalist. Soon, each night at the bungalow seems to turn for the worse, with knocks at unearthly hours, demonic sounds and eerie movements. Tarun suspects Laxman to be the mischief-maker, trying to prove his points. As Nimmi's fixation with Shabbu increases, the family decides to consult a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist explains Nimmi's imaginary friend as a result of her loneliness and terms it as a common technique used by children to grab attention.Laxman's sudden disappearance and the increasing curiosity in Pooja to find answers for the ongoing activities make her install wireless cameras at various places in the house, which record Nimmi playing with what seems like a ghostly apparition. Tarun's mind starts reeling as he sees the captured footage; it is proof enough for the disturbed family to finally decide to leave the house. But the house has other plans: Nimmi is found missing the next morning. The police are called in to investigate but they consider the family delusional and do not take much interest in the matter.Tarun receives a mysterious phone call, after which they find Laxman murdered. The house seems to be on lock-down and the phones jammed. Taman is mysteriously killed. Nimmi appears possessed by the spirit and tries to kill both her parents, until she's finally burned and defeated as the remaining family flee, bloody and injured. Nimmi then introduces herself as Shabbu to the neighborhood children.Cast: We see J.D. Chakravarthy in an ineffectual role as well as Manisha Koirala. The acting is highly dubious. Manisha Koirala tries hard but the script and plot is so bad that even these established actors cannot make the film work. I was especially disappointed with the Satya star J.D. Chakravarthy. I wonder why Varma chose Manisha Koirala over Urmila Matondkar. Urmila is excellent in these roles. Also Manoj Bajpai would have been a better choice over J.D. Chakravarthy.Script: bogus. The climax itself is laughable to seasoned horror veterans. If I was a director I wouldn't have directed a film with a pathetic script like this.Effects: lack of decent special effects. You need a very scary atmosphere for a horror film to work. The camera-work is also dull and does nothing to improve the mood of the film.Verdict: this film is an insult to the fans of Varma who have watched good films of his in the past. Don't waste time or money on this film.Hindi Horror Cult Films: Sannata, Darwaza, Purani Haveli, Veerana, Tahkhana, Dak Bangla, Guest House, Purana Mandir, Bandh Darwaza, Saamri, Shaapit, 1920.Most of these films can be viewed/downloaded for free on Youtube and hindilinks4u.net." 
" Made on the same lines of Phoonk and Raat, nothing new!","Bhoot Returns made by the versatile filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma sadly offers nothing new and paves the same nails of the director's earlier flicks like Phoonk and Raat. I wonder what made RGV think that he could replicate the success of the novel Bhoot. Like Phoonk, the story of BR is about a small girl possessed by a restless evil soul whom she calls "Shabbu". Her parents (J.D. Chakravarthy and Manisha Koirala) realise what a grave mistake they made by moving into a new apartment, like in Bhoot. Add to that, the hero's sister (Madhu Shalini) decides to install cameras into the house to see if there's really a spirit present in the house (attention: Paranormal Activity). I wonder why RGV is obsessed with not giving his horror flicks a happy ending or leaving the plot incomplete like he did in Raat, Darna Mana Hai and Darna Zaroori Hai. Is another sequel to Bhoot Returns on the way? I hope not!The way the story is fashioned, there's not much scope for histrionics. Manisha Koirala battles with giving her expressions of fear and confusion. She handles most of the part with ease but looks lost in others. J.D. Chakravarthy tries his best with expressions. Madhu Shalini tries to bring some novelty to the plot but again, her efforts are restricted by the plot. Alayna Sharma shows promise. I like the way how RGV handles the scary scenes without sound effects. The silence helped to enhance the mood of the film in most portions but the chills and thrills in this film are limited. Overall, Bhoot Returns disappoints. By the time, the film ends you'll have popped several anti-depressant pills and went straight ahead to bed!" 
" Bhoot Returns is utter disappointment","I must agree RGV did not hype this movie as much, but he still used the "BHOOT" franchise to get attention. Back in the day, bhoot was an amazing movie, for its time and for the time when bollywood was busy doing the usual, Bhoot was a brilliant movie, with amazing performances by everyone. Bhoot brought back Horror genre into the Industry and was followed by a lot of other horror flicks some which were decent some which just vanished. Let me now talk about bhoot returns, RGV used the 'Documentary' style shooting method, and a lot of First person camera angles, which could've been used better, He said he picked up some ideas from Paranormal Activity-2 but I guess he didn't implement them properly. It could've been so much better. It was a major let down, they were used at all the wrong angles and wrong scenes. Next MAJOR let down was Sandeep chowtha's background score.It was terrible, there was unnecessary use of overly dramatic string sections and bass drops all over the movie, and considering there wasn't anything scary to go with the music the whole thing ended looking really silly. There wasn't a single scary scene and the movie lacked the X-factor. Some scene leave you with a 'face-palm' and some leave you giggling. Performances by all the actors was under average. I guess it would've been much better if he had just copied Paranormal activity-2 as it is.... RGV should seriously tweet less and focus more on his movies." 
" A cheap mediocre quickie by RGV, which wrongly uses kids in an objectionable manner.","It's a well known fact that Ram Gopal Verma doesn't really care about the success or failure of his movies. He has confessed this several times in his interviews that he just moves on when a film gets complete and starts thinking about his next without caring about its good or bad box office result. The attitude is fine till he is able to deliver quality products to his viewers and fans waiting to see each of his new directorial ventures with the same spirits. But if the final outcome of his products keeps receding like his last few projects then that is surely going to hamper his image as well as his fan following which is still hopeful of getting a new masterpiece from the maverick any next Friday.The maestro is back with a new sequel to his earlier hit BHOOT released in 2003, but it cannot be called a sequel in the right sense since it neither takes the story further, nor is anywhere close to that well made classic appreciated by both the viewers as well as the critics. In fact BHOOT RETURNS is a very cheap kind of movie, made on a very economical budget and shot on a lower format as RGV's last release DEPARTMENT. Due to its tricky format, he very smartly avoids extreme close ups or highly flashy scenes in his shots, due to which a common viewer will not be able to guess that its not the usual format he is watching on the screen.However here the problem increases to many folds as not only the format but the film also hasn't got any solid content which can scare or entertain the viewer in its less than two hours of duration. The story starts in the same manner like many other previous ventures where a family shifts to a new house and then starts experiencing some unusual happenings there. This time RGV also uses few references from the famous PARANORMAL ACTIVITY series movies of the west which perfectly match the lower format of the film quite easily. In the first half he mostly plays with silence and successfully delivers some scary moments through his good old unusual camera placements (perfect for 3D) and the similar kind of frightening soundtrack as used in the original. But post intermission he suddenly gets onto a speedy mode, quickly wraps up the proceeding by killing two kids and then finishes off indicating towards a part three. And due to this, as one moves out, he feels like having watched a long TV Serial episode played in the theater instead of a complete film which just seems like 'Cheating'. Performances also fail to make any kind of major impact because of this very reason despite of having some known names such as Manisha Koirala and Chakravarthy (Satya).So in business terms, RGV might be able to recover his cost and may also make some profit selling this cheap product at various digital platforms in this cyber age. But what he has really done in BHOOT RETURNS is a sort of scam tried with his own loyal audience by making a fool of them in the theaters and giving them quite less in return of their costly multiplex tickets. Moreover here I have another major point of objection in the movie where RGV has used children killing with knife and being killed (burned) towards the end in quite a disgusting manner.The question I want to raise here is that if the Censor and the authorities are so much concerned about showing Child Labour on the streets, Child Smoking on the screen and Exploitation of Kids in Reality Shows then how can they let innocent kids feature in such strong films based on Communal Riots, Ghosts or Brutal killings?If Censors cannot allow a child smoking a Cigarette or even holding it in his hands on the screen then how can they let the same child hold a knife and killing someone with all blood around the body in such a cruel manner? In fact acting in such kind of sequences can have a much stronger impact on his or her 'still developing' psyche than just smoking a cigarette. Hence personally I strongly don't appreciate using kids in films dealing with these particular genres. And if the subject really demands a kid to be in it for a solid reason, then it's the duty of the director to take utmost care of those scenes in particular as they should not leave any kind of long lasting scar on the kid's psyche, staying for a longer period of time affecting his personal life.Unfortunately, RGV doesn't take care of this important fact mentioned above in his BHOOT RETURNS and the film uses the two child actors in its climax quite harshly.Hence you can watch it if you strictly don't miss any horror film released at regular intervals of the year. But in case you wish to see it only for RGV then you can easily give it a miss since BHOOT RETURNS is just another below average, mediocre flick by the master, which fails to reach his own high standards set in the past." 
" Simply Nonsense","After watching this one we'll wonder "Is it really a venture of Ram gopal?" Where is the horror? Why Manisha Acted in it? There is no such events that make you stand up from your seat or increase your heart beat.You will feel weird after watching this one and think if there is any horror flick ever created like this one? I think RGV direct this movie after got an hallucination by watching English horror flicks. The plot is very weak any way The movie is about a family who start living in a new house and the situation they has to face there.Bad script,worst direction,nothing positive in it.My view: Don't waste your time." 
" Another low budget movie from RGV... Just like old food in a new plate","I considered RGV as master director of crime movies but his direction in horror films is very disappointing except in Darna Mana hai and Darna Zaroori Hai. I have seen many of RGV's films and I liked most of them. RGV has capability to make better movies in low budget but his formula doesn't work in all type of movies. For example - Bhoot Returns. The Story of this film is like the story of any 1 hour television horror show. I am totally disappointed with the movie and it also left a question in my mind. What the hell was RGV thinking while making this movie? By The way do not waste your money for it's DVD, you can watch this film during it's telecast on the TV." 
" The Bhoot (or Manisha) should never have returned!","I'm confused.....was this referring to Manisha Koirala returning? Nonetheless neither the Bhoot nor she should have returned!! Apart from the terrible acting, sorry I meant the lack of acting, the storyline was way too predictable and of course who can miss out the outright plagiarism from Paranormal activity. Neither the characters nor the plot was in sync with the storyline which is basically a repeat of the 1st part. One question did come into my mind, the whole story revolves around the last family disappearing at the end of the movie and then the house owner gets a new tenant. But JD makes a come back in the sequel! Oh by the way, we never get to see the Bhoot itself!" 
" Not even half as good as Bhoot 1","Watched this as a horror fan, but really there's nothing special in this film. They have tried to combine the features of a documentary + TV serial + horror film+ camera recording like Paranormal activity.A family of 4 moves in to a house whose previous tenants have simply gone missing, and then their sweet little daughter starts to see things and hear things no one else can, and then you know how it goes .The good? Maybe a few thrills, the acting of the actors at times.The bad? The film is nothing NEW and is just a mix of ideas from paranormal activity, Poltergeist and even from RGV's own films like Phoonk 2. Acting gets weak at times, effects aren't that good really. The film is quite predictable – white figures at night, sudden blasts of music, swing moving by itself, mirror images not moving after the person has moved from the mirror, doll.we've seen it all before.Perhaps this film was made on a very low budget. I wouldn't recommend watching this. Bhoot was much better" 
" Super Duper Bakwaas","RGV needs a psychiatrist !! I really don't know what is he trying to prove !! First of all, there is no Bhoot in Bhoot, and when Bhoot finally arrives in last ten minutes, that would be cutest ghost ever!! Rest of 80 minutes are filled with boredom, awful sound effects and little comedy. Dolls are for children not for scaring adults. I was told that this movie is not for minors, but I think if you don't wanna see Pogo or Nickelodeon Bhoot Return is good thing to watch. RGV should grow up and think out side the box. Box in this case = crazy and dumb camera work, dolls, balls, silly music, scared servants, childish screenplay and ignorant direction. My score = 0/10 I couldn't give less than this :( :(" 
" Don't waste 90 min","Well i went to see this movie as a Horror one. But except last 15-20 min, its a comedy movie which does not make any good progress through out the whole movie.When you go to watch a horror movie, you always get excited by the surprises. But in this movie you could pretend every next scene.They copied some scene from Exorcist & some from Paranormal Activity but could not justified at all.So don't buy tickets to watch this movie. Best option is to download or get a CD from any friend and finish in 30 to 40 min. max.I hope RGV will not make the next part of this movie ...." 
" mild horror at best! but worth watching!","Bhoot returns was not a great movie, i will add only mild spoilers .there's not much horror in the movie although there is suspense... i would recommend this for teens not adults! It starts off with manisha's character with her family( madhu shalini and jd chakravarty playing her sister in law and husband and 2 kids) shifting into a new house and her daughter finding a doll from the new home and from then on the story shifts, into how the whole family gets disturbed with "shabbo" which the daughter says from whom she got the doll from. "Shabbo" starts causing mayhem for the family.The family thinks that "shabbo" is only her the girls imaginary friend and and don't look much into it, which will turn out to be a big mistake .. i wont tell you all anymore of the story!.. I would say that the director spends to much time ,well most of the movie, to create suspense, that there's not really any horror though out the movie apart from the climax, and it leaves you unsatisfied.Now to the performances. Manisha was good and she works her part well but she looks bored? why i don't know, maybe because she made a movie after a long time? i don't know! Now to madhu shalini who plays manisha's sister in law,i can say she was great and she could have been the saving grace of the movie. She is hot and a great actress and i would love to see her more movies. jd chakravarty is just OK and rest of the cast not much to say at all .. all in all a average affair at best .. its short so that is a plus point i would recommend it if you have a lot spare time."
