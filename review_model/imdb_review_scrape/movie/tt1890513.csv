" Not a bad deal","Brings back memories of dirty weekends, for sure :-) At least that part of the movie seems authentic enough. The protagonists rock for their natural performances. The connection with MMS scandals (net blogs are full of such scandals), isolated farmhouses, spoilt brats on overdose of hormones and sleazy film-makers are genuine. The MNS chudail (ghoul) becomes repetitive, but is scary at times. In short, not a bad deal.What jars are some of the horror sequences, the director's sudden realization that horror movies should have horrifying effects - and hence a surfeit of effects (sound and visual) at the end. The jarring music jars, and the movie ends, presumably to be continued in a sequel, which will explain some of the loose ends of the prequel. Good marketing strategy.The house of Balaji Telefilms is not known for quality productions, whether for TV or for cinema. So it is useless to expect a Spielberg or Stephen King masterpiece here. The heroine is top-heavy and sensuous enough.. the hero is sufficiently rough and rugged. Both play their respective roles with aplomb.If you take the proceedings with a pinch of salt, the movie is not a bad deal. I voted 6/10." 
" RAGINI MMS - Movie Review : Watch the original 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' instead of this cheap imitation.","As an out of the routine review of this latest inspired project from a reputed production house, I would like to proceed giving you an idea of how RAGINI MMS may have been conceived a few months back.A Queen producer of the small screen after moving into film production, tastes a marginal success in one of her low budget projects, called LSD – LOVE SEX AUR DHOKHA, majorly shot on hand held camera. Taking an idea from that, she thinks of making another movie on the similar lines to be made in a few months time. Now, while her team is looking out for a plot to be selected, someone informs them about an Instant Hit movie in the West made on a shoe string budget with a horror plot called "PARANAORMAL ACTIVITY". The next day itself everyone watches it, selects it and decides to write a more Indianised Script around the same theme of a haunted house and hidden cameras.But in a few days time, the team thinks that only horror element, without any other added gimmick as shown in the Original 'PA' may not work in India. So taking a hint from their last successful project LSD, the writers decide on to bring in some Romance, Sex and Vulgarity into it which will make it more sensational and a news-making item at the time of its release. As a result, a MMS scandal scoop is added into the film along with many long smooches and bed-room scenes to bring in more viewers into the theater. Further, as in India it might be tough to terrify the viewers without any visible spirit (like in the original 'PA'), hence a vaguely visible spirit is also added into the movie, who speaks in a strange tone and also kills all the people visiting the haunted house in a bloody Ramsay manner.After having everything in place, while shooting the pre-climax sequences, both the director and the cinematographer suddenly remember another famous low budget HIT movie of the west called "THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" and get excited. So keeping the same film in mind they shoot the wandering in the woods (bamboo trees kind of forest) sequences in the end with the night vision hand held camera quite similar to as seen in TBWP.OK, now the film is ready.and we need to promote it heavily. So with a clear marketing vision, a buzz is spread that the film is based on a real life incident faced by a girl called Ragini on whom the film is actually titled RAGINI MMS. And right before the release of the film, the girl actually comes into the news saying that this is not her story and she is being used by the producers. To make the buzz even more interesting, extremely vulgar posters are designed by the graphic designers to promote it along with the news of the film facing problems with the censors due to its unacceptable concept. And hence a perfect drama is staged to deliberately create another instant money-earner for the famous production house by fooling the audiences.But unfortunately, this time the whole process goes in vain since the end product turns out to be pretty confused, vulgar, funny and spooky all together taking the viewer no-where in its small yet over lengthy duration of around 100 minutes. The film starts off smartly reminding you of the brilliant LSD and entertains you in its initial 20 minutes mainly because of its realistic abusive one liners. Later on though it manages to shake the viewer occasionally but on the whole, fails to give you a good entertaining time in the theater.The first time director, Pavan Kirpalani has got the talent but loses the track mainly on his editing table and could have easily made an impact with a heavily edited version of the movie, of around only 80-85 minutes. He copies major things from the English Original, so cannot be credited with anything great. In a songless film, as it should be, the Background music is both designed and used perfectly as required by the theme. But the film mostly relies on its sexual stuff more than the horror one. In the first half it simply looks like a B grade sex movie desperately interested in exploiting the females on the screen. Raj Kumar Yadav of LSD fame, plays an extension of his precious role in LSD and he is even more cunning this time which in fact is impressive. Kainaz Motivala has a soothing presence and acts well.However, many of the viewers who haven't seen either PARANORMAL ACTIVITY or THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT may like it to some extent. But for me, RAGINI MMS only remains a cheap kind of Indian imitation of the West, so I would rather suggest you to watch it's original if you really want to get spooked.And here are the two things I learned about Bollywood from RAGINI MMS : 1. Firstly Bollywood can easily copy the concept of a film, but it still finds hard to stick to the concept alone and has to deliberately add SEX into it un-necessarily.2. Secondly Bollywood still is not comfortable with a film having a duration of less than or around 90 minutes. So with its heavy obsession with the length of the movie, the writers and the directors are forced to add extra sequences into their project to make it around 2 hours.And in both cases the victim remains the Project as well as its viewers." 
" Nothing original. Heavily inspired by two Hollywood flicks.","I saw this movie at a theater near my house and let me tell you audience were not scared instead they were laughing. Pavan Kripalani does not bring anything original in his directorial debut. The treatment of the film is copied from Hollywood flicks "Paranormal Activity" and "Blair Witch Project." I don't understand why Indian producers cannot hire writers who can write original stories and screenplays. The cinematography is not as impressive as it were in the respective Hollywood films. Also, audience were laughing at the fact that why the ghost struggles to kill Ragini when it was very easy for her to kill the other men. Even lechers sitting around me in the theater were disappointed as they were expecting a lot of steamy scenes. Highly disappointing film." 
" One Of The Very Few Scariest Bollywood Films Of All Time!","So, after a loooooooooong time, I came out of the theater impressed, entertained and committed to buy the DVD. Ragini MMS thrilled the hell out of me at every junction of its Paranormal Activity-type film-making.The lead actors are perfect but I don't think they go parallel to what I hear where the true events. The girl is voluptuous, bigdi-baap-ki- bigdi- beti and gullible whereas the guy is a prick! The story is straight and tells us what it intends.Music is good, so is the direction and the effects. But, the editing and camera work could've been a little more professional. Cut that out, I totally enjoyed the 90 minute-scare!This is a must watch and very recommendable. I hear Sunny Leone is the lead in its sequel. Although I don;t know the story, I guess she will be all right as the character Ragini because she's got what Kainaz has. Where is the pre-book counter?WATCH OUT FOR: the message!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOLanguage: Strong | Sex: Mild | Implied Sex: Very Strong | Foreplay: Very Strong | Mouth-Kiss: Very Strong | Alcohol: Strong | Smoking: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Very Strong | Drugs: No" 
" ridiculous","i don't mind bollywood movies based on Hollywood inspirations but this movie lifts entire scenes, not just the story lines, from paranormal activity 1 & 2 + blair witch project.... right down to the white undershirt and shorts worn by the girl in paranormal activity.and oh yea, the score is from the fifth element -- the track "koolen." i'm not sure to what extent eric serra and producers of the English films can file a lawsuit against ekta kapoor but its something definitely to consider because this is just insane. you can't have people stealing your movies and music. if India wants to join the first world club like china then they HAVE to police their most visible and influential film industry -- bollywood at the moment is out of control with plagiarism." 
" Horror Sex aur Dhokha","To begin with, I am a little disappointed with Ragini MMS in terms of originality. The film has a little resemblance with paranormal activity (as it was seen in movie trailer).However makers have added the Desi spices to the movie by some Indianized dialogues (or say abuses) and strong story and sub-plots.The genre of the movie is a winner itself.The combination of sex and horror (which was used indirectly in Bhatt's movies is the stream line here). Intentions of the film makers are very clear here.Just two elements horror and sex, no melodrama or Bollywood masala.Rajpal is very influential on screen.His screen presence and comic timing is bang on!Kainaz has improved a lot after her bubbly role in Wake Up Sid.Explicit scenes are done comfortably by the lead and their chemistry is extra ordinary.Story is straight without any twists and turns.Screenplay is tight and tangling.Dialouges are surprisingly fresh,witty and sultry.The dialogues (and slang) gives a good flavor to the horror movie.Background score is a mile stone for horror movies considering the fact that high pitched digital sound and scorching guitars are used for score in an Indian horror movie.Minus some originality and faulty editing, the movie is the scariest date movie of India till date." 
" Entertaining, despite its flaws.","Although not as impressive as the 'Blair Witch Project' or 'Paranormal Activity' (most of the horror elements have been borrowed from these movies), Ragini MMS still delivers 90 minutes of entertainment. The sexual theme will keep the viewer mildly amused at the beginning and then gradually introduce the scares of the movie. The CGI will not leave you stunned but you definitely won't take your eyes off the screen. Good performances by both the stars and decent direction. This popcorn-flick could have been done much better. Don't watch this movie if you want to be on the edge of you seat because this movie is a little off that mark but it does give a good competition to the rest of the horror flicks in Hindi cinema. Might scare you or may make you hysterical but it will be fun nonetheless.Enjoy it in the dark.6/10" 
" Good Plate Bad Meal","Ragini MMS came and went away in a jiffy, and unfortunately couldn't make a ground for itself. I don't think it would be remembered in the next decade or might have been forgotten by now itself, who knows? The problem is, most of the Indians don't like when the ghosts show their gizmos in a ghastly style. So what's so special about this movie? The good thing is that it keeps the viewer's eye on the plot and holds his feet tightly to the ground. We must never forget that we are surrounded by these unknown entities, who are often enraged when their territory is intruded by humans. So don't look at the plot, the plot falters big time and what remains is the location, atmosphere and the fear of an unknown entity that may be very near to you, yet difficult to perceive. The plot promises itself to be a true story, where a girl was discovered unconscious after spending several days at a haunted house.A young man Uday (Rajkumar) brings his girlfriend Ragini (Kainaz) at an abandoned and fairly spooky mansion. He wants to get intimate with her and holds a wicked intention to make an MMS of the moments of intimacy unbeknownst to the girl. For this he has made prior arrangements. He has planted several cameras in the room, which are away from sight but powerful enough to capture the moments of love. Uday is lousy and foul-mouthed, and bickers Ragini with his unholy and offending remarks. At the mansion, he spends time with Ragini, so as to persuade her to make love. However, his advances fail when their friends (another couple) drop in to say 'hi'. Frustrated, Uday insults them on their very face asking them to leave. They leave and Uday continues his advances to Ragini. Ragini finally discovers that she is a bait and reprimands Uday for his wicked motives. However, little do they know that the mansion is also the home to a witch, who was charged with the murders of her own children and died in the mansion itself. The witch doesn't like these trespassers and begins settling the scores by herself. Finally the couple finds that they are left on their own to fend off the enraged witch, who would not stay calm unless her wrath is inflicted upon.There are some scenes that make you feel that you are on a trip to the country side and are spending a night or so in a haunted mansion. The mansion is a piece of hell, which by all means succeeds to qualify its virtue of being haunted and possessed. The actors are juvenile and have really nothing to do. They are more or less like guinea pigs who are simply the victims of witch. The real-time camera work adds good punch of surrealism and originality. The silhouette of witch in traditional Maharashtrian attire, gleaming in the semi-dark room assures and validates the presence of a fearful entity in the mansion. The turning of food into grubs also adds a distasteful crunch to the synopsis. If you are looking for an action-packed horror film (like most of the Ramsay hits), Ragini MMS isn't for you. However, if you are a fan of dark rooms, spooky atmosphere, state-of-the-art presentation, and bizarre involuntary reflexes, please don't miss this." 
" Boring storyline and vulgar dialogs","When I saw the trailer, I was expecting something like LOVE SEX AUR DHOKHA. But this film is nothing but a disappointing effort. It is full of vulgar dialogs and average script with even average actors. You all might have figured out by now that it is a copy of two Hollywood films, i.e., Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project. The character of Uday is also not original it has been lifted from Love Sex Aur Dhokha. I remember in that film also there is a character who films himself while having sex with a girl. As far as the horror element is concerned, well I was not scared and there were people around me in theater who were abusing the director for making a crappy film like this. Don't waste your money on this film." 
" a decent Hindi horror movie after a long time","After a long time a decent Hindi horror movie maybe after darr of RamGopal Varma before he turned himself into a factory.Premise is simple and though they say it to be inspired by real events this kind of story of a wronged soul communicating with innocent/scheming outsiders has been repeated umpteen number of times. But thankfully it does not have that typical Ojha/magician so common in all Hindi movies who comes to deal with the bad soul neither it has a religious figure normally a priest or someone who comes to frighten away the ghost. This makes the story very realistic. Acting by lead pair is too good ,though movie sags towards end but length has been kept proper and it ends before viewer will get bored. Good movie. 8/10" 
" Ragini MMS : Scary Yet Forgettable","While watching the latest horror film Ragini MMS I must have jumped out of my seat at least 38 times. The reason was more the jarring sound effects than the actual horror unleashing on the screen. This pretty much sums up the movie.Plot So a sleazy Delhi type guy (from the cast of Love Sex Dokha) wants to shoot his girlfriend in a homemade sex tape. This is where the similarity to the actual Ragini case I guess ends. Instead of shooting it at his own space, he takes her to an abandoned (but perfectly furnished) bungalow.The bungalow apparently belongs to a friend of his and is fitted with a camera in pretty much every room. These cameras along with the dude's own hand-held camera are supposed to make up the movie frames of Ragini MMS. Whenever needed the filmmaker conveniently shifts to some normal movie cameras as well which pretty much dilutes the whole idea of the hidden camera concept. Of course before the couple can begin to get horny the horror in the house begins to show to the viewers. The film is over punctuated with sudden sound effects, whooshes sounds, heavy breathing, unlit screens, scary looking camera angles and of course glimpses of a traditional witch spewing Marathi to boot. As the couple begins their stuff the witch decides to teach them a lesson. While the sudden movements and sudden glimpse of the supernatural do make u jump am not sure if they are the right kind of fodder for a true horror buff. On another hand the actions of the characters as usual make no sense. While Yadav is good as a sleazy 'thoku master' the girl (Kainaz Motiwala) is reduced to screaming in hot pants and a spaghetti top tied up to a bed. The sleaze is considerable in the film but not quite campy enough to be enjoyable. The film borrows from a number of point of view films like Blair Witch project (the apology to family and the running in the forest) as well as the more recent REC (the discovery of the room where the actual crime might have happened) and of course Paranormal activity (titled fallen cameras showing the horrifying proceedings)So the question remains - is Ragini MMS scary enough? Well yes it is. The premise of shooting through digital cameras does create a strong sense of realism which is why so many horror films get made in this format. The sound effects along with the demented and repetitive Chudail are definitely eerie. But the best character are the camera angles which leave just about enough nooks and crannies in each frame to give you a feeling of unease.In the end Ragini Mms could have been a landmark Indian horror film much like Ekta 's 'LSD' and 'Shor in the city' but its attempt to link the mms scandal to what is an out and out supernatural horror story ended up confusing the filmmaker. Had it gone all out with a horror theme it would have been fun to figure out a number of horror movie questions - why Panditji sent them to the house, what was the crime committed, what happens to the bunch of boys who came out of nowhere to disappear in the same time. why was the house fitted with cameras.But unfortunately someone in production did not want to let go of the MMS sleaze factor thinking that would sell the movie. So the filmmaker gets to show the oh yes we believe that plaque "inspired by true events" and also gets to end the film, with a 'LSD' / 'Cloverfield' like epilogue which is supposed to make us emotional about the sleazy couple. Not to mention the blink and you missed it end notes which make no sense. In the end there are too many loose ends and poorly sketched sub plots for the film to be recommended It is though - Recommended to people who get thrills out of jumping in their seats due to loud sounds and fans of MNS for the Marathi speaking chudail. Special Mention : LSD fans can watch for a tribute where Yadav dances on Lucky Looka's "Tum gandi achi lagti ho!" – was the only time I smiled in the movie." 
" "Horrifying", if it has to be defined in just one word.",""Horrifying", if it has to be defined in just one word.For me, Ragini MMS delivered far more than what it promised. The class and the execution of the horror sequences were far more intriguing that I had ever imagined. The fact that impressed me the most is that even though, primarily you get the feeling that it might be a movie with just sensual scenes and not so many significantly petrifying moments, it actually left its mark on me for the direction of the horrifying scenes and the quality of performances by the two actors. The movie revolves around a couple who set out to the outskirts of Mumbai for a weekend getaway. But as the reel rolls & the movie unfolds, it turns into a nightmare for the two as they encounter a lot of paranormal activities happening around & realize that the house they are staying in is haunted. Probably, as the movie was shot as if in real life, you connect to the horrendous events and the situations fashioned more closely and feel to be a part of the whole idea even more.The movie does give the inkling that it has been inspired by Paranormal Activity but apart from being shot as if in real life, the movie is fresh and presents unnerving scenes and goosebumps all the way. Raj Kumar Yadav is definitely here to stay and Kainaz Motiwala was impeccable in justifying her character. I sincerely recommend this one to Vikram Bhatt and expect that he would probably learn a thing or two and would not dole out movies like Haunted 3D again. And if he is too dim-witted to understand what a horror movie is then maybe it is time he hangs up his director shoes for the good of all humanity. Applause to the whole team of Ragini MMS as they have surely provided a benchmark against which all future Bollywood horror movies must be evaluated." 
" Genuine Scare!","After a long time, finally a Hindi horror movie that sends shock waves of fear while you watch it. Two stories combined into one. A nice simple setup. Another example how you can make a blockbuster out of 1 crore INR budget. Lead actors gave a terrific performance. Movie ends in time. No time wasted in explaining the birth/delivery of the demon :). People should learn from Ekta Kapoor's creative skills while producing these kind of movies. This film keeps everyone glued to their seats throughout the duration of this wonderful attempt to showcase Hindi horror. Do not waste anytime reading this review now. Just go watch it for yourself, and delight yourself. Value for money treatment. Good movie. 8/10." 
" The Ragini B!tch MMS Project","The Ragini B!tch MMS Project This raunchy date movie has turned the table into a voyeuristic horror genre on the likes of 'Blair Witch project' and fixed camera angle of 'Paranormal Activity'. But, Defiantly its not inspired from both of its Hollywood counterpart. Only the technique and presentation style is inspired, and Ragini MMS has its own real story and Desi flavor. The débutante director Pawan Kripalani has done justice to the digital real film camera by borrowing it from the producers of Love, Sex and Dhoka Ekta Kapoor.While Ekta has proved that if you have a good story, you don't need A rated superstars. Actors and budding artiste can do the justice with a pure dedication. Dibankar Banerjee's casting from LSD has proved it once.This spooky genre has not wasted time in explaining the story behind the haunted mansion or the love between the two quintessential Bombay lovers. The best is left for its sheer imagination and that's bang-on the target. Its creepy when your girl-friend is Pink Handcuffed, and you are about to unzip the down, you get a hair-pull so strong that your skull bleeds and you forget the hard-on and fall straight in to the paranormal world of frenzy bites and creepy voices.The senses are bound to loose. The most real shot was when you see a door open on its own you don't freeze in the demurral but run like a child screaming and shitting from the ass. That was hilariously spine chilling. The camera was loosing the resolution from time to time but the angles on which they were mounted gave a good Wide-Angle view of entire frame. By keeping the 3/4 frame empty, the viewer was forced to ignore the 1/3rd frame where intimate kisses were shared. Eyeballs were looking for something paranormal throughout. The twists and timings of Ram Gopal Varma's Bhoot were missing in this clip, nevertheless, it was a good attempt. Both the actors Raj Kumar Yadav (again borrowed from LSD) and Kainaz Motivala were amazingly truly perfect. Raj almost doing the same cast from LSD , mouthed the frustration in a very natural way. The explicit dialogues were neatly written to show him as insensitive and chauvinist. While Kainaz ruled the second half of the movie with her screams and pleads. While Bappi Lahiri did a great remix of 'You are my Chicken Fry and Fish Fry'. The other songs were in background and competent enough to get mixed with a background score. The Score was scary enough to run a sense of fear was was repeated so badly that it became evident about a paranormal presence. The screenplay and cinematography did justice to the subjectiveness of a voyeurism." 
" Spooky!","'Ragini MMS' may not be flawless, but it sure is Spooky! It has enough of spine-chilling moments to earn itself a viewing.'Ragini MMS' Synopsis: Out to relax & have fun at a farmhouse, a couple experience horror at the hands of an unknown entity.'Ragini MMS' is shot well, giving it a documentary type feeling. And while the first-hour focuses more on sleaze, its the second-hour that turns nightmarish. At a crisp 90-Minutes, this horror flick leaves much an impact.Pawan Kripalani & Vaspar Dandiwala's Screenplay has a few loose ends, particularly in its first-hour, but goes full throttle in the second-hour. Kripalani's Direction, on the other-hand, is eerie. Cinematography is good. Editing is crisp. Performance-Wise: Kainaz Motivala is brilliant as Ragini. She enacts the tormented/haunted protagonist with remarkable commitment. Rajkummar Rao is impressive, as always. On the whole, 'Ragini MMS' is a worthy horror flick." 
" Worth watching a least once!","It was only matter of time,before Bollywood get into the found footage genre.Ragini MMS (2011) Hindi movie, no need for any subs, as most of the times, they speak in English!Two couple who go to farmhouse and most of time, all they think of is having Sex.when get into the mood, there friends come, thing start to get scary.We see the ghost here and there, it is a shame , cause it take the tension away, however there were some scenes, that were actually surprising good.Near the end, after some descent scenes, it loses it tension again , which makes go down hill.This is actually Bollywood version Paranormal Activity4 out of 10 I think worth watching for least once! (Just for laugh)."
