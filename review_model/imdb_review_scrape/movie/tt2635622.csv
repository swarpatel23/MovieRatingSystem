" Speechless....RGV take a bow......","Years passed since the terrible attacks of 26/11 that horrified Mumbai and killed hundreds of innocent people....many documentaries made, explanations given but finally Ram Gopal Verma brings 'The attacks of 26/11' and he undoubtedly brings back in our minds all the tragic events of the fateful day...'The attacks of 26/11' focuses the beginning of the attack and the terrorists involved in it as portrayed by one man - The Joint Police Commissioner played by Nana Patekar.The film begins with invasion of terrorists through the sea and since then every attack on various places are shown, which easily unnerve any Indian watching the film. The firing is brutal,bloodshed even more terrifying as real life incident, forcing you to hate terrorism even more.The rescue mission of Taj is not shown which i believe is due to the script being more Kasab oriented.The script is perfectly written, the background score takes this movie to another level, the direction is absolutely perfect(no silly camera cuts) and the climax makes this movie a masterpiece.As far as acting is concerned, its Nana Patekar on one side and others on other.Nana Patekar proves why he is the best.Debutant Sanjeev Jaiswal impresses as Kasab.This movie is not only a tribute to all those innocent victims on that fateful night, but also reveals the flawful and irresponsible security system of our country, leaving its people helpless against terrorism." 
" It's rather Gyan on the Attacks of 26/11","What do we expect from a movie made on a Terrorist Attack? Bare minimum is that it presents the account of the events unfolded. But what this movie actually tells is: 1. How mercilessly the people were killed in Mumbai Attacks at the various landmarks. 2. How helpless the police was. 3. Gyan on what is Jihad and what it isn't.Though it was made in way back 2013, it is not that popular and rightly so. People don't expect much from Ram Gopal Varma but Nana Patekar was someone to look for in this movie.But even Nana was a mere narrator in the movie and not much more. Below is what could have been there in the movie1. How Police control reacted to the attacks. 2. What State Govt. did in the state of panic. 3. Reaction of the Center, delay in the movement of NSG. 4. Most importantly, the NSG operation in the Taj and beyond.How do you expect to make a movie on Mumbai Attacks without including all these?" 
" Dark, depressing but good film","Score 7 /10 Director Mr. Ram Gopal Verma has done good work. He has very balanced approach about this extra sensitive Terror Attack on Mumbai on 26/11. He has enhanced the emotional quotient of this film by adding some very fine nuisances in taking and presentation. Hats off to Mr. Director, for making this film without inserting any commercial aspect. His intention was just to pay homage to the person and Police men killed in this unfortunate attack simultaneously he condemned the terror attack without naming or underlining any religion. Director also tried to avoid unnecessary violence, without showing a crying baby being shot he shown the gun shot sound and the baby's crying sound went mum. Writer Mr. Rommel Rodrigues's work is very good. He conceived the film and scenes without being influenced by any prejudice. Scenes are good except few ones who sounded exaggerated for example, receptionist at Taj ,tried to save the kid, when all the attackers are roaming around her. It was absolute filmy. He highlighted the emotions by adding few scenes, for example Terrorist asks for water and killed the person after drinking it, old person killing in Cama Hospital. Dialogues are very good. Performance wise Nana Patekar is brilliant. Actor Sanjeev Jaiswal who portrayed the character of Ajmal Kasab is also brilliant. Rest are fine. Action Director Mr. Javed Aejaz 'work is impressive. Art work by Udai Prakash Singh is also good. DOP (Harshraj shroff and M. Ravichandran Thevar) work is fine too. Background score by Amar Mohile supports well the film." 
" Are we getting the message?","This is not an easy film to watch but it is a highly recommended one.A group of young men get hold of a boat and disembark in Mumbai with one and only intention: to kill as many as possible. In case one wonders as to why, the quickest response would be that they were convinced that such a deed would please God and a pleasurable paradise would await them.Once ashore they follow their mission to the last letter. Death is spread in Mumbai like virus. In a taxi, cafe, hotel, train station and hospital.The blindness of religious indoctrination does not allow them for a single moment to think and comprehend their actions; after all they are pleasing God, or so they were convinced.The scenes are both graphic and distressing to watch. For much of this film, I wish I had been there to warn the unsuspecting family man, the child, the female clerk all of whom died simply because they were on their path.The theme of the film must not be misunderstood as being anti-Islam but anti-fanaticism. Religion in itself is not the problem, extremism is.Watch it, shed tears and pray for healing and compassion." 
" Ram Gopal Verma is a sensationalist not a realistic filmmaker","All RGV wanted to do with this movie was give a very sadistic take on the incident. Seems like RGV lives in a bubble where does not care to research his film subjects anymore. If he had even watched the documentary which is on youtube he would have had some real story to tell. A well rounded script is missing. The movie just has enough substance to make a good promo and entice people to come to the theater to watch the movie. This movie is in no way close to how the real indecent needs to be portrayed and a very very irresponsible effort on a very horrifying indecent.This movie is strictly a money making exercise and a lazy effort. Wish i could give it 0 stars" 
" Highly Irritating !","Cant imagine how poorly the selection was made on the segments of stories. What to choose, and what to ignore -- thoroughly failed.It appears that the director had lost the confidence on himself, hence he chose to give maximum footage to Natsamrat. Although, the selection of Nana Patekar is 100% correct, but director failed to decide how much time of the movie should show Nana.And who are the people listening to Nana Patekar ?? Are they useless officers, don't they have any concrete question to ask. There are tons of Opinion (with emotion, and lousy background music) being shared than actual Courageous incidents, which plenty of Mumbaikars, and NSG commandos must have shown.This movie could be a pride moment, but director has truly lost it." 
" Awesome movie","This is really an awesome movie. The movie touches the horrible aspects of the attacks. The presentation of how the terrorists killed men, women, children alike was heart touching. The way the movie presents how the terrorists are brainwashed is commendable. Also the post-event scenes are really good. Especially the dialogs of Nana Patekar when he takes Kasab to the dead bodies of his fellow terrorists. The highlight of the movie was Nana Patekar, his acting was brilliant to say the least. He brought life to the character and portrayed it really well.I would say the movie is a must watch. Kudos to RGV for making such a brilliant movie." 
" You wont regret after watching it!!","RGV the gutsy director of Indian cinema had come up with his new flick with a highly controversial n terrifying concept of "26/11" It couldn't be easy for a filmmaker to re-imagine the horror of that terrifying night that scarred the entire India forever. What Ram Gopal Varma is dealing here is a raw reality...He raised a question on what kind of hate the terrorists are showing towards any other country? I think no one on the earth can answer this question... coming to the performances "Nana patekar" the Joint commissioner of Mumbai and the guy who played the role of kasab was Impeccable and they nailed it. Overall its a good flick with a thought provoking conversation.. I bet one will not regret watching this flick instead he comes out with his heart filled up tears..!!" 
" boring yet non-informative","* This review is about film not about the terrible events this movie is loosely based on.First half of the movie is collection of video clips, random scenes with flute or violin playing in background. No narrative progress, no characters. Camera work is very poor, the camera rotates frequently at most of the scenes. And endlessly people are getting shot. Instead of covering all the events the filmmaker could have shown one tragic incident - may be fictional.In second half the movie picks up few characters and some conversation. But the emotional flute doesn't go away. The protagonist (Nana) is mostly preaching his opinion on everyone throughout the movie." 
" No story, sensationalistic acting/direction and over-the-top violence without anything more.","I'm an Indian living outside of India, so perhaps the events aren't as close to me as the average Mumbai local. In saying this, I don't see how this film did any justice to the real events. It's a gore-fest with one-dimensional militants who are portrayed as beings with super-human powers. No story or deeper message. Just a random selection of attacks locations that are covered. You feel sick and bewildered by the end and not in a good way. The only decent thing was the soundtrack." 
" A disturbing but real facts of terrorism !!","Long time after Sarkar, RGV has made, not great but, a movie which will hold you tightly to your seat with a sequence of shocking, painful, disturbing but true events.Based on the facts disclosed by Rakesh Maria (then Joint Commissioner of Police, Mumbai Police. Now Chief of Anti Terrorist Squad, Maharashtra) to Investigation Committee regarding the 26/11 terror attacks on Mumbai, story is narrated by Nana Patekar who played the role of Rakesh Maria. Nana as usual has given an outstanding performance but other characters in movie lacked badly the acting skills. Sajeev Jaiswal, as Ajmal Kasab, was undoubtedly a good choice to play the role but overacted in a sequence where he was interrogated by Nana. The scene where Nana as police officer takes Ajmal to mortuary and shows the dead bodies of others terrorists is the most outstanding scene of the movie with marvellous dialogue delivery by Nana. RGV also tried smartly to infuse some moral dialogues to avoid hurting any religious sentiments and conveyed a message that terrorism is just a product of some ruthless insane minds and not of any community or religion.The script lacked some deep emotions. It was all about killing and butchering of people all over the city. Audience would have liked to know something more about the terrorists and reason behind making them into such killing machines.It's highly recommended to watch this movie only if you are interested to know the truth and mentally prepared to see enormous bloodshed, others should know that this is not one that can be enjoyed with popcorn." 
" I Am Disappointed By Ram Gopal Varma!","While the director is striving very hard to handle his reputation as a phenomenal film-maker, comes a shabby work by him which not only plays with the emotions of people affected by the theme of this movie, but also stems his future.The Attacks of 26/11 is a gimmick which tells you a story more of the involved terrorist Kasab than talking about the actual happenings. The first half is average with information easily read, reviewed & published on media. It involves most of the killing part and how the terrorists grapple the whole city with their shenanigans. With soundtrack copied from Max Payne's theme music, it couldn't get worse with the second half which is utterly boring & monotonous. Moreover, it only focuses on Kasab, his worships & beliefs, & Nana Patekar, who didn't go well with the character he portrayed. Conversation goes boring as we expect more action on screen. Soon after, the lead officer tells us about the attacks reaching its crescendo, the movie shuts off with further dull screenplay.Performances are great and vivid, with the lead players doing well for being débutantes. I appreciate RGV's talent in that, but the music is bad, screenplay is average and cinematography is poor. Writing, as i told, is improper, flaccid & vague. Plus, the climax makes it worse and I personally feel, that should NOT have been included in a movie which boasts off of a title so oblivious with its own story.The Attacks of 26/11 is not a must-watch because you know everything about it, just like Kathryn Bigelow's 0Dark30. But, if you wait for the DVD and rent one to reconnect with the way Mumbai Police, judicial system works and to reinvent the sentiments of the gruesome attacks, I would recommend it for the sheer vendetta pleasure!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: Critical | Nudity: Mediocre | Sex or Foreplay: No | Violence: Very Critical | Gore: Very Critical | Smoking, Alcohol or Drugs: No | Vulgarity: No" 
" Incompletely done with serious lack of creativity","The topic was obviously a chilling real life incident that should and could have been portrayed a thousand times better than this. The movie did have a great start but soon (as usual..!!) RGV started beating around the bush and he ends up completely missing the part where Indian army bravely confronted those terrorists and swiftly and efficiently neutralized the threat. The title should have been How The Attacks Of 26/11 Began, because RGV completely missed the end. This movie shows how incompetent RGV has become and proves that he is not bold enough to do justice to any serious real life subject. He should better try his luck on something like PHOONK 3..!!" 
" Only reason to watch this movie is to help victims not for story or direction","I was having really high expectation from this movie. I was wrong to think that people might change. People who made this movie still think that they should add some "Masala" in movie to make it hit. Movie is lacking realistic effect. They tried to show so many things and in the end it turned out to be a spaghetti. There is huge difference in reality and in movie, they tried to add some sentiments and add some stories which do not make sense at all. I am sure it must be difficult for them to think about a good ending, but I am still confused what kind of message they are trying to send out via this movie.Only reason why I went to see movie and ask you to go and see because of its aspect of helping victims of Mumbai attack." 
" One of the best film on terrorism","'The Attacks of 26/11' - is very good featured movie, in my opinion. I definitely recommend this movie to every youth or if you like Ram's movie. i really liked the scene of this movie where 'Joint Commissioner of Police' - Nana Patekar explained the meaning of Jihad for those who as Kasab.Actually salient Hindi movie. this is a Hindi crime-thriller film, based on the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Directed by Ram Gopal Varma and Sanjeev Jaiswal who plays the role of terrorist Ajmal Kasab.We get to know the extent to which Kasab is brain-washed and given a falsified understanding of Islam in the name of Jihad. Nana's wondrous reactions during this episode are marked. Such scenes show the class that RGV is capable of, even though he has been aided by the performances of Nana and Sanjeev Jaiswal as Kasab. Though the characterization of the terrorists is pretty hollow with just black shades written all over them, Sanjeev is authentic as the evil incarnate Kasab who realizes his foibles as he is finally hung on 21st November 2012." 
" Movie has it's heart in a right place","I just watched 'The Attacks of 26/11' on Eros Now... not sure why so called Critics are writing against this movie or debating about what is missed to show in the movie. Somehow I feel; this movie is not about what is shown and what is missed ... it's a depiction of those tragic and barbaric events where Indians suffered, Indian forces suffered, it was a situation in which nobody actually knew what was going on for first few hours ... everyone learned a lesson with the hardest way about security, lapses, proactive preparedness, faith and sad psychopaths trained in the name of God. Movie has it's heart in a right place and there is a message too - if someone really wants to understand it."
