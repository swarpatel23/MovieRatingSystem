" A great movie with DIRTY title","It is very rare when a director justify vulgarity and in that particular movie. Director Milan Luthria crafted it very intelligently. I hope most of the people will go for sex oriented movie but I bet they will go again for a fine movie. The speech of Vidya at Award Ceremony Scene was the peak of the movie and real subject. A female actress dominate in a movie with 03 main heroes with a big name Naseeruddin Shah, popular one Emran Hashmi. Vidya handle all exposing material with a grace and style and i think from that movie she will have her new Identity O Lala. Perhaps this is not the first time which depict the behind the scene of film industry but this time it is really fascinating that there is no casting couch type material and struggle is very correct. Go and watch once on this review and you will go again on you own." 
" Great first half! So so Second half!","Great first half! So so Second half! Typical Milan Luthria movie, 80s setting, 80s music, people don't speak normally but in couplets. Vidya Balan outstanding, others mediocre. Naseeruddin Shah looks ugly but that's what the movie demands from him. The movie starts well with a young girl who is fascinated by movies and glamor. She runs away from her move a day before she is getting married. Turns up in Madras and tries to get to act in movies. She stands in queue for junior artists outside studios without luck. Then one day she gets a chance to finally do a song which no one else is willing to. And from there her career looks like taking off. But a minor setback almost forces her to go back. But not to be and she becomes 'Silk'. Vidya Balan as silk has done great work and the movie is all about her. 3.5/5" 
" Focuses On The 'Dirt' In Our Minds","Expectations for this movie were totally 'Tharki'. The nation was set on fire since the trailer was launched. Vidya Balan is the hot topic in every corner for her flaunts and oomph. Emraan's something new avatar was also noticed. Shortly, people who were keen to see 'The Dirty Picture' were either waiting to see what Vidya had still to show or some very delicate people were impressed by the centralized theme of the movie.Silk Smitha was a heartthrob of her time, not for her acting but her skin-show and sex-appeal. Describing her life is nothing so important as she as totally washed out from many minds. But I would praise Director Milan Luthria's 'one step forward' thinking and make such a mind-blowing movie on Silk. I mean, Silk would have got amazed if she could watch the movie and realize how interesting her life was to many people.Ekta Kapoor is a producer of some different movies like "Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai", "Love Sex Aur Dhoka", "Ragini MMS". 'The Dirty Picture' is a 'hatke' and 'sexy' attempt to bring a rage in Indian movies.Reshma (Vidya Balan), a girl who had big dreams in her mind sets off in a journey that will lead her to vulgarity, betrayal and impure fame. Her career stars with being 'Silk' and ends when the 'Reshma' in her rises. Suryakant (Naseeruddin Shah), Suryakant (Tusshar Kapoor), two siblings were the two obstacles in her 'want to be' good life. Ibrahim (Emraan), who looked upon Silk as a vulgar, dramatic actress and personal enemy, finally finds that what she is doing is not intentional. Real Life V/S. Movie - the difference is shown in this film and by whom it's shown is late Silk Smitha.No Two penny comments on performance by Vidya Balan. She has shown everything where what should be - 'Body' and 'Herself as a perfect performer'. I can say with extreme surety that she will win 'Best Actress' award in every function (can get a national award as well). The sex content in her role, horny expressions, dialogs (that can shut any person up) - everything made Vidya Balan the show-stopper, simply marvelous. Next to her whom I liked very much is Emraan Hashmi, a small wonder. His role was thin and short but his carrying out was commendable and deserves applause. Naseeruddin Shah was fantastic as a rude, selfish and villain-ish person. Tushaar Kapoor was first-rate in his gentle turned evil role. Rajesh Sharma deserves some points. Others like Anju Mahendrum, Mangal Kenkre & Shivani Tanskale are fine.The One thing which I liked most in the whole was kick-ass dialog was heroic, crude and strong. Some sexual references were hilarious. Nearly every Dialog is a stunner. Awesome work on dialogs as well as story and lyrics by Rajat Arora. Cinematography by Bobby Singh was good as he covered 80's wonderfully. Costume by Niharika Khan was top notch. Making Vidya Balan look sexy in her big tummy was hard but costumes covered much. Music by Vishal-Shekhar is average. 'Ooh La La" and "Ishq Sufiyana" are the only ones that one can enjoy in a situational position.On the whole, The Dirty Picture is the best movie of this year so far as it has every ingredient perfect in it. From Story to script to dialogs to performances - everything is just fantastic. Even the Sex-quotient is very high and vulgarism is over the top, still this movie shines for his genuineness and strength in plot and lead actors. Moreover, This movie is a grand success for it's three elements "Entertainment, entertainment and entertainment". Finally I would state that, If you skip "The Dirty Picture", it will be one of the biggest mistakes you've ever made. Please, watch it! P.S. - This movie is 'Strictly', not for kids and under-ages." 
" Vidya Balan should be given 2oscars...one for choosing "The Dirty Picture" movie and other for best acting..!!","Director Milan Luthria and script writer Rajat Arora are back with another realistic movie. Once Upon A Time In Mumbai duo's latest film The Dirty Picture is another bold attempt. The movie is daring and provocative, yet it keeps distance from vulgarism and offensiveness.The Dirty Picture is a biopic on the life of the South sex symbol Silk Smitha. Actress Vidya Balan's bold performance is the major attraction in the movie. Vishal-Shekhar's music, Rajat Arora's dynamic script and sharp dialogues, Bobby Singh's cinematography, Pony Prakash Raj's choreography and beautiful art works and costumes are the other attractions of the film.The movie is set against the colourful and entertaining setting of the South film industry of the 80s. It revolves around a girl's journey from a makeup artiste to a sex goddess. She battles fame, fortune and alcohol. The Dirty Picture does not focus on the sleaze, but the tragic story of the sex siren, who provided titillation to thousands of viewers, but died a lonely and tragic death.The first credit of the movie goes to Rajat Arora who has written a wonderful screenplay and power-packed dialogues. Secondly, it is Milan Luthria, who has wonderfully executed them on screen. The narration of the movie is so interesting that it will not let the viewers rest even for a single second. In the second half, Emraan-Vidya sequences slow down the pace, but soon the narration picks up pace dramatically. Of all what strikes one's mind is the recreation of the era 1980s.Vidya Balan has a role that she has never played before and she has delivered a brilliant performance. She surely wins the heart of the movie goers with her confident act in sizzling show and dare-bare sequences. As an ageing South Indian superstar, Naseeruddin Shah reminds us of the 1980s stars and his acts surely provoke claps, laughs and whistles among the viewers. Emraan Hashmi and Tusshar have also got totally new role. As a headstrong director, Emraan has delivered a bold act, while Tusshar appears fantastic in his role. Others like Anju Mahendru, Rajesh Sharma, Shivani Tanskale, Mangal Kenkre and Imran Hasnee have also done justice to their respective roles.The Dirty Picture has a rich production values and Vishal-Shekhar's music is the major attraction in the technical front. Their compositions like 'Ooo La La', 'Ishq Sufiyana' are 'Honeymoon Ki Raat' are the pick of everyone. Pony Prakash Raj's choreography and Bobby Singh's cinematography are excellent in these songs. Akiv Ali's editing is also commendable.Overall, The Dirty Picture is a right blend of wonderful script, amazing direction and bold performance from the lead actors. The movie has a universal theme and mass appealing story. This movie is a good entertainer." 
" Vidya Excels in a weak script","A fat lady from a humble background struggles and succeeds into making waves for her seductive moves in the silver screen. The above sentence it self creates a lot of hype and curiosity when transformed into silver screen. But not all films are equally great on screen as it is on paper. The Dirty Picture is one such film which could have been far better if the writer chose to be more risky like Silk herself. Silk Smitha is known to almost all Indians of different age groups who have satisfied their inner fantasies through the videos of this dusky seductress of 80s.Its a huge task in bringing out a character as challenging like Silk who death was as mysterious as her life. Coming to the film let's dissect it to figure out both the extremes. What went right :- Milan Luthria and Rajat Arora were totally successful in recreating the mindless era of 80s. The aging heroes used to play college kids, the settings were outlandish, the songs were bizarre with unique blend of eccentricity in the choreography and over all executions used to be loud with capital "L" â€“ that summarizes the 80s films. All these elements were rightly incorporated in the film. The scene were the aging hero plays the role of college student and the way director says "fine shot sir" reflects the scenario of those times. But within such setting audience used to find entertainment,entertainment and entertainment thus a new star got created. With sensuality and boldness Silk rocked the milieu and rose to peak of stardom very early in her career. The growth of Silk has been portrayed with utmost sincerity and kudos to Luhtria for casting Vidya Balan arguable the Best actress of current bollywood. Rajat Aurora should be applauded for the gutsy dialogs which forms the crux of the film and provides ample 'entertainment" to the janata. The shallowness of 80s is rightly depicted in a subtle manner and evergreen hypocrisy of Indian people has been aptly portrayed. So what went wrong? Probably to provide 'entertainment" more emphasis has been given to the dialog baazi rather than a coherent script. The characters behave in a inconsistent manner. The reason for Abraham's hatred towards Silk is not convincing and neither his change of heart. In fact Luthria's dig on art cinema seems contrived. The narrative falls in the second hour following similar clichÃ© loop. The psychological dip of Silk was shown in a hurried manner which doesn't evoke pathos and climax is one of worst scripted in recent times. What could have been a movement transformed into plain mediocrity. Like his other films Luthria's choice of subject is superb but every time he loses the scope of a masterpiece by playing it to the gallery. Coming to the acting department Naseeruddin Shah was average as aging superstar Surya. He started off in a brilliant way but then seem to be sleep walking throughout the film. Tusshar Kapoor is wasted in a insignificant character and he didn't rise above it either. Emraan Hashmi had a half baked character but he did justice to the role of Abraham who hated Silk. In fact the conversation between Abraham and Silk brought spark on screen whenever they crossed their path. Rajesh Sharma as Silva Ganesh was superb. Earlier seen in small yet significant roles in Khosla ka ghosla and No One Killed Jessica Sharma got a meatier role here. And as the successful producer with a unique mannerism he did better than the male star cast. .. Anju Mahendra was adequate in a small role of gossip journalist.And the main hero of film is Vidya Balan. As mentioned earlier one of the fine actress of our times Vidya simply rocked as Silk. Bold, inhabited oozing out ample amount of flesh and cleavage the territory was unknown for Vidya but she did justice to the role. Credit should be given to costume designer Niharika Khan and Moiz Kapadia, Vidya never looked vulgar even though she was playing dirty. Stupendous job by Bobby Singh, whose lens never tend to titillate the audience. Under able hand and being a powerhouse of talent herself Vidya showed the energy she had within. In every screen she was looking like the character and her voice only added to the gravity. Be it in the sequence when Vidya seduces a crowd in front of the journalist's house or giving a speech in the award function she showed confidence in herself as an actress. She is bound to sweep all award for her role in this film and No one killed Jessica. The other hero of the film is "ooh la la". Sung by Bappida himself the song is a time machine ride to the by gone era. And Pony Verma's choreography had the nostalgic feeling to it. Already breaking the music charts 'ooh la la" is a phenomenon. Sadly overall music album by Vishal-Shekhar is disappointing. Ishq Sufiana may be good to the ear but was totally forced in the film. Overall Vidya Balan excels in a weak film which had the potential to be a classic. But one thing which the film did succeed is showing the hypocrisy of Indian janata who openly criticizes sleaze but enjoys being dirty under close doors. Indeed a slap on the "clean" Indian society." 
" Vidya is mind-blowing! Witty dialogs!","Definitely Vidya's best performance. She goes all out in accurately depicting Southern sex siren sensation, Silk Smitha. Not only is she able to boldly re-enact the cheesy, campy item songs, the seductive bedroom shots, and the scanty, cleavage-spilling costumes, but she is able to illustrate her passion for films and fame, disgust with society's hypocrite nature, starry-eyed dreams, heartbreaks, disillusionment of her recognition and reputation in the industry, and the devastation of rejection by her family, lovers, directors, costars, and the entire nation as a whole.Songs are catchy and fun, particularly "Ooh la la." The script and screenplay are brilliant--clever dialogs that will leave you in splits. Tusshar surprisingly gave a great performance. Naseerudin was good, too. Emran was not bad. My favorite scene in the film is Vidya's "award acceptance speech." It reveals how hypocrite society truly is. Can easily watch this film once again." 
" Watch first half for some lighthearted fun and a few laughs. Bail in the interval. Don't stay for the second half.","This movie was extensively marketed and apart from the sleaze, also appeared to be a promising story and biography. The final output is quite disappointing.The first half is enjoyable with Vidya Balan playing a "devil may care" character, some funny double meaning dialogues and sequences and general cheerfulness of the movie.The second half is pathetic. The transition of Vidya from a successful star to a self-destructed wreck is not at all convincing and Balan fails to impress. The story is very patchy and disorderly. The end is specially an overkill with the bridal dress and the sleeping pills. The kind of character Vidya plays wouldn't act like a helpless and pitiable character of 1960s. I guess the only good thing about the second half is the attention paid to Vidya's makeup - the eye bags, clothes that suggest many extra pounds and the paunch.As for the other aspects of the movie, Tusshar looks mentally retarded as usual. He should probably only play mentally challenged characters as he wouldn't need to act much and would fit right in. Whoever wrote the dialogues tried to hit a six off each delivery. He needs to understand that each dialogue can't and needn't be a punchline. Emraan Hashmi should specifically get someone to write dialogues for him that are not always senseless metaphors.Overall - 5/ 10 rating. Watch the first half for some lighthearted fun and a few laughs. Don't bother with the second half." 
" Vidya Balan is Terrific!","Inspired by the life of the late Silk Smitha, an actress noted for her erotic roles, 'The Dirty Picture' is decent biopic on the late sex-symbol. The main reason why this biopic works, is because of the On-Screen Silk, played terrificly by Vidya Balan. She stands out! 'The Dirty Picture' is a tale of pain, desire, ambition, struggle, and darkness. It's about Silk & her entire journey. It's a complete look at the rise & fall on the late south-siren.Cinematically, 'The Dirty Picture' is a decent effort, that has enough potential to earn itself a viewing. Of course, the Second-Hour could've been better, but otherwise, there is no major flaw in here to point out. Rajat Aroraa's Screenplay is generally good, but it definitely could've been stronger in the Second-Hour. A special mention for the superb dialogues. Milan Luthria's Direction is passable. Cinematography, Editng & Art Design, are mention-worthy. Music by Vishal-Shekhar, is goodPerformance-Wise: Vidya stands out from Scene A to Z. She delivers a terrific performance as Silk. This is Her Bravest & Best Performance to date. Emraan Hashmi is first-rate. Naseeruddin Shah is his usual self, while Tusshar Kapoor deserved more footage. Rajesh Sharma & Anju Mahendru are simply fantastic in supporting roles.On the whole, 'The Dirty Picture' is a decent effort. Watch it for Vidya's Performance!" 
" A Nutshell Review: The Dirty Picture","I suppose it's not easy trying to make a bio-pic about a controversial actress that calls for some parading of skin due to various states of undress. In Singapore, the Rose Chan project has been stalled from its initial announcement, with one of the close contenders for the role dropping out and to date leaving the project quite in limbo. In what would is a generally conservative society, you can imagine the challenges faced by director Milan Luthria (of Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai fame) in making The Dirty Picture, a largely fictionalized biography film about one of the sex sirens of Indian Cinema known as Silk Smitha, who had made a staggering 450 films over a career spanning 17 years before her untimely demise at age 35.The Dirty Picture chronicles the life and times of Silk Smitha (played by Vidya Balan) as seen through the eyes of her one time enemy and art-house film director Abraham (Emraan Hashmi), her less than successful love life with directors and screenwriters, and in her desperation, willing to do just about anything for that shot at stardom, in an industry where fame is reserved only for a few, and chauvinistic too. In this version of her life written by Rajat Arora, Silk Smitha adopts her namesake thanks to a producer who sees the opportunity to set box office alight when he chanced upon the unused item number in Abraham's film, and from sultry dance numbers one after another, her role in films begin to expand, and so does her notoriety amongst the gossip rags, playing up her sex siren role to strata-strophic heights. I suppose you know when you're a star when audiences pay full ticket prices only to enter the hall to watch your item number, and leave soon after it ends.My interest got piqued not only that this is a story of the rise and fall of a sex siren in a film industry, or the controversial scandals that go on behind the scenes, but truly stem from getting another chance to peek into how the industry might have worked previously in the 80s, in South Indian cinema. Om Shanti Om provided that glimpse into the 60s era, though this one offered a look at both mainstream and the adult based industry, although the latter was a little too short to make an impact in this film. The star system is obviously in full swing here where everything a superstar does get praised and sucked up to, and the reverse where junior artistes get the flak for everything else is the norm. Favours are exchanged for opportunities, and soon Silk becomes the mistress of megastar Suryakant (Naseeruddin Shah) who carries out their affair on set behind the back of his wife.Director Milan Luthria crafted a very charming film that doesn't border on the exploitative, even though the film's main subject matter is precisely that, presenting just how cutthroat the film industry is, where enemies can become friends and vice versa, and just how fame is such a fleeting issue one can get forgotten fairly easily and fade away just as fast as one enters the scene with a big bang. There's an excellent balance in drama, comedy and of course the need to highlight just how far Silk dares to go against industry norms and shock and awe audiences and crew with her boldness, and the pace is kept to a breeze, forgoing most of Silk's earlier, non-acting life to kickstart where it started to matter.And clearly the star of the show is the heroine, Vidya Balan, as she takes on what would be her most challenging role to date, making herself believable as a sex siren with no qualms in dressing to the nines in figure hugging outfits, piling on the kilos to look the part of the South Indian actress, and spouting lines of dialogue filled with endless sexual innuendos, not to forget constantly giving that come hither look. In some way Luthria managed to steer clear of being vulgar, and his Silk came across as more sensual and seductive, rather than downright crass, giving you reason to believe just why hundreds of thousands worship the new female film idol who's taking the industry by storm. Balan deserves every single accolade that will come due to this role, as she provides both that steely exterior that defies the odds, and that vulnerable interior self who is out of luck when it comes to matters of the heart, making you sympathize with Silk every step of the way.Naseeruddin Shah also excelled as the prima-donna superstar actor Suryakant, a Casanova of the industry who soon establishes an affair with the actress, and is every much the cad he is made out to be. Having co-starred with Balan in an earlier film last year in the acclaimed Ishqiya, they continue to share that chemistry on screen here, with Shah in top form as he hams it up in his role as the pampered acting star able to call on every whim and fancy. Tusshar Kapoor stars as his screen writing brother Ramukant who takes over the romantic male lead midway when he romances Silk, and Emraan Hashmi's uncompromising art-house director Abraham assumes the role of the enemy of the heroine inevitably turned friend and eventual lover, whose story arc resonates the constant struggle between a director's vision, to that of the producer's in wanting to guarantee box office returns.With superb acting, magical musical numbers, a strong narrative storyline and a look into the exploitative films of the 80s era, The Dirty Picture plays on its much preached about mantra of entertainment, entertainment and entertainment, delivering what it had promised, and at the same time making it thought provocative, teasing you to find out a lot more of the real Silk Smitha and the films and era that she had crafted in her heyday. Definitely highly recommended!" 
" No Dull Moment","Some people watch a movie for its elegance, good acting and high production values. Others watch movies for their sleaziness, skin display and controversy. How often do you get both the sides leaving the theater satisfied thinking that they got a great value for money? Milan Luthria presents The Dirty Picture. In the words of Silk Smitha, a film works for three reasons; Entertainment, Entertainment, EntertainmentÂ… And The Dirty Picture is entertainment. However, it's a movie for Adult audience who can take the kind of humor and exposure it has to offer. The Dirty Picture (DP) is story of a South Indian actress Reshma, popularly known as Silk. Rajat Arora's script keeps flirting with glamor of showbiz and the bitter realities faced by a girl running away from her house to become an actress. To the extent where she eats only a spoonful of sugar once a day as her meal. It exposes how despite criticizing the amount of exposing on cinema; the masses actually enjoy the skin show and that sex sells. The story is a rather predictable tale of rise and fall of a female actor and whatever happens in between, however, it's the treatment and performances that make DP a thoroughly enjoyable watch for lovers of almost all genres. There are two more things that make DP stand ahead of other recent films. First is the outstanding background score. From the evergreen Naka Mukka to the entertaining 'Ooh Lala' use in the background along with the SFX, background music is simply superb. Secondly, the fiery dialogs are probably the best thing in the entire film. One jewel after another. So much so that you cannot even keep count on them. Bobby Singh's cinematography is first rate. His best work to date even though he was an unexpected choice. When you have to show sleaze and skin, it's a tough job to still stay classy and Bobby Singh does exactly that. Especially the way Vidya's being overweight has been shown is remarkable. DP is loaded with powerful performances. It's not very easy to find Emran Hashmi in a bearable role. I don't know why a talented actor like his keeps wasting himself in his serial kisser movies. It was once again Milan Luthria after Once Upon A Time in Mumbai (OUATIM) who took out the best in him. Tushaar too is bearable. Can you believe that? Every single supporting character has done a fabulous job. Rajesh Sharma in another major role after No One Killed Jessica (NOKJ). Navin Gothi, the actor playing Vidya's lucky charm and the director who first kick Vidya out of his set are especially very good. Arya Banerjee makes her presence felt as a new-comer Shakila. Vikas Shrivastav as casting director who sends Vidya out with a 5 rupees bill and Sarang Sathaye as choreographer George who gives Vidya her first song are noticeable in their cameos.And then comes Naseer Uddin Shah. Who else could have done a better job than NS as the aging malicious actor? He gets into the skin of the character of Surya and does a splendid job of it. Despicable and convincing.And last but not the least is Vidya Balan. What a powerhouse of an actress. She started the year with NOKJ and has ended it with The Dirty Picture. Totally contrasting roles. In one she was a nerdy homegrown nonentity and in the other she is the sex symbol of the industry calling herself Entertainment and boy, how she excels in both the roles. Watch out for her award ceremony speech, her early scenes with Naseer and the climax. Easily the best female lead performance in 2011. Filmfare worthy material.The real hero of DP is Milan Luthria. How far has he come from Kachhe Dhaage days? If he was very good in OUATIM, he is even better in DP. Complete grip on the screenplay, taking out the best from the actors no matter how small their roles is, creating an 80s atmosphere still looking totally different from Om Shanti Om and Action Replay, this is a director how is in command. This makes the sequel of OUATIM the most anticipated movie of 2012 as far as I am concerned.The Dirty Picture hardly has a dull moment. It does get a bit slow when it goes to the soft side of Vidya and Emran, however, that too remains an integral part of the storyline. Do keep in mind the 18+ rating of the film before going to the theaters and keep the expectations on those lines. If you do, you are up for a treat." 
" Uninteresting","Whats with the 'rave reviews' and 'unanimous praise' directed at this movie and its lead actress ? Well....its bullshit...that's what it is.I am from the south and Silk Smitha is a legend in her own right. Another misunderstood and misrepresented vamp actress(with talent mind you) who met a 'oh so familiar' end (both in career and in life). Nevertheless, great material to make a bio pic.And here is where my problem is - when you make a biopic or try making one, you show us the "person", not play out 'rumored tales' about the person's life (in the case of Silk its already public knowledge). Evidently no research has gone into her real life or personality. When discussing biopics, movies like Patton, The Aviator, Malcolm X and all those great ones come to mind. Although Silk Smitha's life is not as celebrated as Howard Hughes or George Patton, you do expect the director do some digging and show us the real personality rather than the screen persona. Vidya Balan is a good actress, only, with a stronger screenplay and content (not to mention a more capable director), she could have made this portrayal a career best. Instead, you have the usual clichÃ©d "masala scenes" and "dance numbers" which totally miss the point. If you guys think this is a great movie, so be it. I understand your limitation and pity the many more crappy Indian movies to come. BTW, the nakku mukka background score was not only funny, but also annoying..." 
" Choli ke peeche kya hai? (What's behind the blouse?)","Imagine you are making a movie about something really energetic in its own way, for instance, the enormous amount of water that is required to fill a large Sintex tank on top of a building. You may begin by showing how water fills up such a huge tank, the energy of flowing water and so forth. It is however important to note here that it is not the water alone but also the magnanimity of the tank, the height of the building etc. that must get to play an important role. Without an uncompromising projection of how huge the tank is, how it was carried over to the top of a large building and, so on, it will become impossible to feel the enormous presence of the water that fills it.And that would sum up how The Dirty Picture was executed. The energy of Vidya Balan in the central role was simply enormous. So much so, that the rest of the picture was unable to match up and consequently felt bland and weak in comparison. People often ask, if the writer writes the story, cinematographer films it, actors act and music director scores, what does the director get to do? The director must ensure that the energy of all people involved in the project is channelised in a single stream that gets projected on the screen and must be eventually, felt by the audience.Director Milan Luthria fails miserably in his job here. A hammy comical Naseeruddin, a controlled Emraan Hashmi and a joke of a Tusshar Kapoor comprise the side characters around the unabashed and shamelessly unapologetic Vidya Balan. Her power over the crowd is merely shown each time by repeated shots of punching movie tickets, crowds of people rushing in and a different dance sequence on the screen. A shabby compromise! The promising biopic is not only slaughtered in its execution by the director but also in its clichÃ©d screenplay (by Rajat Arora who adopts the same dialogue-styles from his previous OUATIM) that allows for an unnecessary narration sequence by Emraan Hashmi and a frequent spew of corny lines and witty (yet, effective) one-liners that end up disrupting the mood of the scene. The audience are however shamelessly satisfied without noticing the loose threads in the story. Like, what happened to the other character who sang with Silk? But who watched it for the story! People cheered when an extra half inch of Silk's bosom became visible or when she has finally got to kiss the medley of different heroes on screen. Special jeers and remarks for Hashmi's kiss. And I was in a multiplex hall.Cinematography comprised of a sepia-ish hue to depict the 80s period in South India which went very well with the art direction but sadly, it avoided wider angled shots which could have been used to capture scenes involving Silk's audiences or at least to add authenticity to the period drama. This, coupled with the screenplay greatly limited the scope of this movie. The star power that the soft-porn star exhibited was neglected in various scenes. For instance, in the scene where Silk was creating a ruckus outside someone's house, the gathering of the crowd and their cheers were avoided and instead, the focus was on Naseeruddin, Tusshar and other star people involved. Better editing could have spiced up many of such shots.Music score was mismatched and even slightly boisterous in some places.(I suspect that they must have hired the guy who gives those reaction sounds from Ekta's TV soaps for some of the scenes). Ooh La La was the only fun song. Honeymoon Ki Raat was a mind-boggler! Why was it even there? Sufiana was an unnecessary addition towards the end but they had to have it to show Hashmi kissing Balan.Acting wise, however, this movie saves its face. Naseeruddin maintained the humour in the first half. Hashmi was consistent throughout. Tusshar was vapid and maintained a stupid look on his face in most of the scenes. Rajesh Sharma is indeed the discovery of the year. After a helpless police officer in No One Killed Jessica, he is unbelievably perfect as the B grade-ish producer. Expectedly, Vidya Balan saves the day by lifting the entire weight of the dirt of this picture and excelling herself as she has done in her past movies. Every performance since her past 3-4 movies has saved her movies from going noticeably awry. I was never a Balan fan from the start. But as of today, all I can say is that no one in Bollywood is in a position to make a picture that can sustain her energy and performance. It's like taking all the water meant to fill the Sintex tank and using it to fill your water bottle. The bottle is enough for you, not for the water.Producer Ekta Kapoor must have a really weird sense of humour. This movie that holds the vulgar expectations of the audience responsible for the rise and fall of Silk targets the very same from the audience of this film. And apparently she has hit the right spot. Sadly, this is apparently what "Entertainment" in a film is all about! When I walked in for a fourth day's show, many people around me were able to repeat various monologues by rote and in sync with the actors. The Irony!" 
" An Outstanding Unique movie from Bollywood. Entertainment, Entertainment and Entertainment.","The Dirty Picture is a biographical movie on the life of Silk Smitha. The story of movie is unique and interesting unlike todays bollywood movies. Vidhya Balan as Silk in the film is truly outstanding. Hats off to Vidhya for such incomparable and incredible role. Naseeruddin Shah had also given excellent performance. Character of Emraan Hashmi in the movie is very unique. He has also did a great job in The Dirty Picture. Role of Tusshar Kapoor in the movie was an average role. Story, script and direction of movie makes The Dirty Picture very unique bollywood movie. Music is also good. The first part of movie will catch your attention. But after interval, movie will become slower.The Dirty Picture is a story of a strong woman, Reshma (Vidya Balan), who can go to any extent to fulfill her dream of becoming an actress. After few hurdles, she becomes an instant sensation 'Silk,' a woman every man desires. But, on her journey to stardom, she eventually starts craving for true love and feels betrayed each time. She gets the first blow, when she misunderstands lust to be love in case of her all-time favourite actor and later a co-star Suryakant (Naseerudin Shah). She is almost trying to cope up when Ramakant (Tusshar Kapoor), a storywriter too disappoints her, though that's truly unfortunate, as he has no wrong intentions. She gets her final blow, when stardom too starts bidding a goodbye to her. Lastly, when her all-time enemy (Ebrahim) Emraan Hashmi, a director turns into her passionate lover, she encounters a sad death.Overall, Entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. The Dirty Picture is an outstanding bollywood movie with a unique story. It's highly recommended movie." 
" Dirty Picture is over-hyped and over cleavage","This is not a biopic of "Silk Smitha", Milan clarified that its not based on Silk but loosely inspired from the story of sensation of south India in 80's. Its becoming trend to lose or gain weight to do justice for the role, but that doesn't justify a good movie. Vidya Balann also put on 15 kgs as per demand of the role and the propaganda, she looked fat, the fat which one acquires after alcohol and age and this fat was beautiful for the character. The titillating and distasteful dialouges ruined the entire movie. Milan was always a Masala director and this movie needed a thoughtfulness about a B grade actor, about her zeal for life and fame. He completely missed it and thus the movie lost the content.The story never justified the runaway teen and her way of talks early in the movie, missing the entire plot. The lecherous role of Nassiruddin Shah was also not sketched well. The Movie looked like a slapstick and serious at the same time and that's where it failed.Let's talk about Vidya now.. She got cleavage and she showed it maximum. The screenplay will make you feel that you are watching a B grade movie. She got the emotions but Milan Luthria failed to portray them , he was not able to focus above the chest to the face. It was indeed a bold attempt from Ms Balan. Tusshar was completely forced written and as producer's brother he was not manly enough even with the thick mustache. He lacked the depth of a serious lover and failed to stand in the times of crisis. He mouthed very bad lines and I ll blame the screenplay. Rajat Arora seems to only research the cheap gossip columns and hence the ugly caricature of Anju Mahendru. The lone journalist in the movie was a wolf or a fox or a cow, you will never know. There is so little know about the Real Silk that the screenwriter missed the biopic stuffs and launched a full throbbing cleavage thumping movie. Emraan Hashmi was cool in the dark linen suits and the only saving grace in the movie. He has evolved with some seriousness. The movie was told as his flashback memory but why. He got some good wolf whistling dialogues. The editing by Akiv Ali is very shady and goes black at times and the lighting's are too dark for movie of glittering status. Vidya Balan's Costumes are unnecessary made filthy, it would have been good if those were kept for movies inside the movie. If you want to whistle throughout watching the thighs and plump bosoms filled with dramatic dialogues, go for it. After all it's not "Boogie Nights" neither "Gia" nor Vidya is Angelina Jolie as Gia Marie Carangi." 
" Yeh, Ms. Balan is a hoot!","Said to be based on the tragic life of Silk Smitha, The Dirty Picture tells the story of Reshma, an ambitious village belle from the South, who aspires to make it big in the movies. Through this character, we also get to see a rather satirical take on Bollywood's 1980s, which is known to be the most dreadful period for mainstream Hindi films of that time. At first Reshma strives to prove her talent as an actress, but as soon as she learns how showbiz really works, she realises that the only way she can make her dream come true is by using her sexuality and exposing her body, and that's where she turns into Silk. The film industry is portrayed as rather sleazy in the film; casting couch is a standard phenomenon, artistry is a word mostly uncommon to filmmakers and audiences. That said, even though I don't buy it all, it is an amusing watch. The dialogue is witty, the art direction is fantastic, and the film is just too colourful to skip in spite of its faulty script. But then, everything is put aside when it comes to the lead role as played by Vidya Balan, who represents everything that this picture is about and everything that's good about it.Having seen her spectacular performances in Paa, Ishqiya, and No One Killed Jessica, I'd had huge expectations from Vidya Balan. Little did I know that she would just transcend them all with her dazzling performance in this film in a role which many actresses would either fight for (mostly in retrospect) or shy away from. Forgoing any trace of whatever she was ever known for, Balan just becomes Silk in a fearlessly uninhibited performance that is replete with energy, authenticity, spontaneity, confidence, and a never-seen-before sensuality. She's unabashedly sexy, charmingly vivacious, awfully attractive and just too smashing hot, and the way she delivers those witty, provocative lines is simply awesome. And if that isn't enough, that turns out to be just one side of hers, because Balan brings a great deal of depth and understanding to this complex character. There's a lot of pain, struggle and conflict in her portrayalâ€”something that a lesser actress could have easily missedâ€”and it often ends up being a moving portrait of loneliness. This is a class act which reaffirms Balan's position as one of the finest actresses of our time.Even though the show belongs to its leading lady, the supporting actors get nice parts to play, and they handle them well enough. Naseeruddin Shah offers a wonderfully spoofy act as a caricature Bollywood hero of the 1980s, that of a middle-aged man that is idolised and loved and still plays parts of much younger heroes on-screen, romancing young girls who could well be his daughters and later playing their sons. Emraan Hashmi is very good in a subdued performance, but Tusshar Kapoor is not as convincing, though good enough. All the rest come and go without leaving much of an impression. I liked the film's music, particularly that "Ooh La La" number, which epitomises the style of the 1980s and which was well presented on-screen. To sum it up, The Dirty Picture is definitely a watchable film, but it's never a particularly convincing one. I somehow wished the story had more depth, and I often found the script too simplistic. But leaving its flaws aside, there's one thing about The Dirty Picture, which is the real thing, and that's, as said, Vidya Balan, whose performance makes every flaw in the film easier to forgive." 
" A Film Everyone In Bollywood Should Watch","I didn't have any expectations going into the theater, but I couldn't believe how good this film is! It is raw and Vidya's mouth is like a loose cannon. As a viewer, the film just takes you on a roller coaster where no other Bollywood film has done in recent years. Even though they are talking about the 80's, the movie's message is still so relevant in Bollywood. The old/aging actor who still plays young roles, and whose mother is portrayed by an actress similar to his age! Vidya, Nasserudin, and Emraan embraced and embodies their characters. It seems they had so much fun with these solid written characters that it didn't even seem they were acting. Vidya's superb in this role and I think any other actress who perhaps was offered the role is hitting themselves in the head. The role was that of Marilyn Monroe and she just showed her vesatality as an actress. The film has good direction and great acting. Some really good memorable scenes include when Silk goes to the journalist's party and sits on her car outside the apartment to only have this mob of fans rooting her. I really didn't understand how Emraan's character starts liking Silk, but their chemistry and acting really sold their love story. The scene where he comes to her house and they are going through her pictures, was very heartfelt. The music in the background brought a tragic love story atmosphere to the movie just like of Mugal Azaam where this man just wants to save the tarnished girl from her misery. I think everyone should watch this film for the surperb acting."
