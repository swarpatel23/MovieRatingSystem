" Anushka's shining moment, Ranveer's shining start, and their ultimate wedding spree","Maneesh Sharma's directorial debut Band Baaja Baaraat is one of the year's most refreshing and entertaining films. It is a charming romance filled with colour, energy and pep. The movie can be easily set apart from all the recent films made by Yash Raj Films, in that it is very simple and it actually shows the beauty of India through its two main characters of young wedding planners, who unexpectedly (for them), fall in love. Sharma's direction is absolutely marvelous, and the film is totally benefited from the fantastic sets, props and costumes, which give the film an authentic feel, along with the characters which look more like real people rather than cinematic heroes. This very portrayal and the script had actually more weight for me in making the movie work. The narrative style makes for a fun watch, and that's thanks to the dialogues and the catchy songs. The film's first half is more of an ornamental wedding spree. And it is towards the second half when the story takes the audience by surprise and turns into a romantic drama that is quite moving and interesting.While watching the movie, it is quite inspiring to see how young people from relatively traditional middle-class families strive to make a career on their own. Rarely do we see in Indian films such young people starting to run their own independent business, particularly when all they have is willpower and faith in their abilities. The growing prosperity of the main characters' business is interesting to watch, mainly because it's not made to look forcedly larger than life, but rather real and gradual. Thinking about wedding planning, one would certainly expect to see some lavish, over-the-top ceremonies, but here everything is lifelike and genuine, and yet colourful and impressively creative. As for the love story, it is incorporated into the story efficiently. The musical duo Salim-Sulaiman significantly contribute to the film's mood with a great list of tracks, among which the energetic "Ainvayi Ainvayi" is rightly the most popular. "Dumm Dumm" is also very good and is wonderfully performed on-screen. My favourite numbers are the romantic "Aadha Ishq" and the melancholic "Mitra".The movie stars two young actors. The role of the male lead is played by newcomer Ranveer Singh, and he makes a confident debut, playing his character's different shades exceedingly well, at times so well that throughout the movie it is hard to believe it is his debut performance. But without a doubt, it is Anushka Sharma who dominates the proceedings with her wonderfully natural performance. Just like her male costar, she commendably masters the dialect of a street smart Delhi Punjabi girl, but more than anything, it is her sensitive portrayal of Shruti's feisty nature, pain and strength that stands out. Moreover, Ranveer and Anushka's chemistry is fantastic. Just watch the scene in which the two of them are standing drunk in front of each other in the dark room. Director Sharma handles the scene very well, creating the right amount of romantic tension, using some really soothing music in the background, and of course the two young leads play the shy nature of the moment with conviction. It is one of the beautiful scenes in the film (and I'm actually not one of those romantic fools).Towards the last portions of the second half, the movie gets more emotional, at times too much but thankfully unlike many bland attempts made in recent films in which everything turns into ancient melodrama, here it works. The scene in which Shruti fearlessly and honestly reveals her true feelings without blinking an eye is terrific - again, superbly acted by Sharma. Singh's reaction is also very real and believable. This scene captures much of their potential. With this film Anushka establishes herself as a capable actress, and I believe she will now be flooded with offers for demanding parts. As for Ranveer, this movie may well put him on the map as one of the most competent young actors today, and I personally find him more promising than most of the guys who have debuted in recent years. The film's ending is nice albeit a tad too sentimental. The situation itself is relatable, but it could have been better done. Still, Band Baaja Baaraat works more for its youthful, lighthearted and effervescent mood, and is overall a worthy feature which makes for a pleasant watch." 
" A lovely surprise!","Finally a YRF movie that is getting good reviews, and made me really curious to watch and check out what is the deal all about. Lead actors are debutant Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma , who has already had a box office hit with her debut film with SRK.The movie is fully set and shot in Delhi, and all characters speak with authentic Delhi-ite accent, it almost becomes difficult understanding after being so used to the Mumbaiya accent in all the other films. Shruti (Anushka) aspires to open her own wedding planner business while Bitto (Ranveer) is finding a way to escape his father's plans to taking him back to village to help in the sugar cane business. They get together and start their wedding planning company, named Shaadi Mubarak, with strict policy of never involving emotions or love in between them. Business goes successfully for them, and predictably, emotions come in between, causing a conflict in running the business together.The love conflict is not new, but the treatment given on the subject, and the whole execution of the movie is fresh and commendable. Also, the movie has a fairly fast pace where there is no dull moment. However, I wish the ending would have been handled a different way, but I guess the director did not want to opt for clich√©d ways.Anushka is very pleasant to watch, and she is looking very good in her simple girl-next-door getups, some scenes even with minimal makeup. Ranveer does his role well too, but seeing his interview on Koffee With Karan, it almost feels like he acted as himself.Highly recommended rom-com!" 
" A Nutshell Review: Band Baaja Baaraat","With Band Baaja Baarat, Anushka Sharma has completed her three picture deal with Yash Raj Films and in some way had gone full circle. In her debut film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi we first see her burst onto the screens in a pre-wedding scene - her character's, before tragedy doomed her to a hastily agreed upon marriage to Shah Rukh Khan's Surinder Singh as arranged by her father on his deathbed. Here, she plays the wedding planner, and a number of major scenes see her both fussing around and enjoying herself in the weddings of her relatives and clients, and playing a role whose profession symbolizes some major shifts in conservative mindsets where weddings are outsourced to professionals behind the scenes rather than leaving it under the hands of relatives.And one wonders how bold the studio is in entrusting a major film to a new first time director Maneesh Sharma whose experience has come from working as an AD in other major films, and pairing the still relative newcomer Anushka opposite the complete rookie Ranveer Singh as her co-star. This risk had paid off, as the end product is something relatively refreshing and spunky, going well with the themes, look and feel for Band Baaja Baaraat which is to break mindsets, and as teenage characters, epitomized the can-do, fearless spirit of entrepreneurship, wanting to try rather than to regret later in life.Anushka plays Shruti Kakkar, who is dead set in her ways in wanting to start her own firm Shaadi Mubarak in the wedding planning arena, and deflecting the usual route where a girl has to seek marriage after graduation and live a life that's more or less set, rote and formulaic. Fate has her chance upon the laid back Bittoo Sharma (Ranveer Singh) who is looking to stay in Delhi a little longer after graduation, otherwise at his father's insistence he has to pack up and go back to his village to continue his family's roots in running a sugarcane plantation. Like all romantic films, it's opposites attract to a certain extent with Mr Relax vs Ms Focused as she reluctantly makes him a partner in her start up, as they draft an informal pact to stay focused on their career path and keep their friendship platonic. At least up until the Intermission where things start to spiral a little out of control as emotions run high, and you'd come to expect the entire second half of the film to run aground with the usual fights and arguments, which in some way parallels the mood of the film where a split becomes problematic, and only when they work together as a team does the magic of the film happen. Basically it's the rules that the duo set out to break in their chosen industry, and with a pact made on their friendship never treading into the romantic space, you know it's a set up since breaking and bending the rules is something they do on a daily basis with a growing business.And this mirror is more pronounced as we start to see how materialism and the building of a career can get in the way of romance, with the tussle on demands for time taking its toil. The only spark in the second half as it plods itself to an inevitable end for a romantic film, is how sometimes we get a little callous especially in taking someone else for granted, and here we see how the female of the species is actually quite complicated when her heart is set aflutter, painting Bittoo inadvertently as the cad without feelings, and a silly boy at that when love comes knocking at his doorstep.On the characters' professional front I would have preferred it a little more if there's some poetic justice dished out in being more direct in being competitors to their brief mentor in the business, who perceived as the best turns out nothing more than a fraud when it comes to delivering quality service. I suppose in the outsourcing business one wonders if one gets the best, or are shortchanged left right and center in the way unscrupulous business is done. This of course gives rise to a myriad of supporting characters such as Maqsood the florist (Neeraj Sood), Rajinder Singh the caterer (Manmeet Singh) and Bittoo's friend Santy the musician (Revant Shergill) to join in as small suppliers hell bent on delivering quality as a business ethic.I've always loved Indian weddings put on screen, because that promises colour and spectacle, with lovely songs and energetic dances putting up quite a performance for an outsider like myself to witness and enjoy. Band Baaja Baaraat offers just that in large doses with the different projects the fledging Shaadi Mubarak organizes, and needless to say I was having a field day. It's bands, horns and revelry out in full force, and both leads were a delight as they breathed life into their roles as business partners turned lovers. Anushka Sharma has grown from strength to strength with each film release, and Ranveer Singh is quite the discovery, with new male Bollywood heroes being quite the rare species in recent years, and his well oiled performance here doesn't betray the fact that he's into his debut. Let's see what other films will appear over the horizon for this rookie.Band Baaja Baaraat is that spectacle that comes highly recommended, so catch it if you can as it nears the end of its run here." 
" Truly surprisingly amazing movie!","I started this movie with a feeling just like I'm going to watch another regular comedy film. But as the movie progresses, I got stuck to my place and I forget that its just a movie. It feel like its a journey of two ambitious friends who learn every aspect of life with experience and with each other. Undoubtedly its a story of its kind and I'm very pleased to see it. Ranveer's acting is amazing. There are few actors whom you believe that they are not acting but playing real. He is one of that guy. I'm waiting for another movie of his. And Anushka is charming and energetic as always. Overall, its a surprisingly amazing movie!" 
" All hail newcomers and fresh blood in Bollywood","Excellent romantic comedy, with great performances and the very entertaining backdrop of the Delhi wedding planning industry. I think both the new director (Maneesh) and lead actor (Ranvir) should do very well in their careers, and the film proves that Bollywood should stop throwing it's untalented families of non-actors at the celluloid screen each week. Imagine how competent the pool of stars would be in the industry if we had fewer sons, bhanjas and bhatijas to contend with. Anushka, too, is a prized possession, as is the brilliant complement of supporting actors in this movie (like Maqsood Bhai and the entertaining troupe of rich spoilt brides-to-be). Songs were tons of fun, and though the film does de-generate into a typical unbelievable filmi affair near the end, you don't mind. It's all for the much needed happy ending." 
" Feel good factor is the USP of the movie","Happiness and smile was, what spread in the theater during most of the parts of the movie and this is why you go to some multiplex. The BBB earns full marks on this front. It is not a nonsense comedy which is pestering Bollywood from last 2-3 years. Neither is this, some intense, provoking, thoughtful movie. BBB is a very colorful, commercial and typical bollywood style movie which has a cute girl with a Desi Guy. It wonderfully depicts the confused mind of both of them when they have to decide on their career and love. It has romance, love, comedy, emotional drama(Thanks God, it didn't last long) and finally a heavenly pleasant happy ending.BBB is the movie of a college girl who is utterly ambitious about staring her own Wedding Management company and a guy, who fell for her during a wedding and situations lead both of them to become partners in their newly started venture "Shadi Mubarak". How their relationship go through various Ups and Downs is shown as movie progress.Talking about the performances, firstly Ranveer Singh deserves huge amount of accolades for his awesome acting. He never seamed like working in his debut project. He was very natural and confident throughout the movie. Anuska Sharma had shown some promise in her last flick "Badmash Company" and this movie certainly raises the bar for her. She did a commendable job in the movie, with her energetic presence and freshness. Wonderful acting by her.Though the movie overall captivate the mind of the audience, its second half has some lose moments where one can feel bored. First half of the movie is pleasantly wonderful. Music of the movie maintains the speed and carries the freshness of BBB.Delhi people are anyway loving this movie as Delhi places and other famous things are referenced in various frames. It is a nice movie to watch and surely adding up to a very small list of good movies in 2010." 
" Highly Entertaining","There are times when you like predictability in a film and you actually look forward to it. You know exactly how the story will unfold and that there will be no dramatic twists and turns and distressing suspense. You still manage to enjoy whatever is going on. JAB WE MET (JWM) was a similar movie. The moment hero heroine meet, you know that they will end up falling in love even if they are not romantically interested in each other.BAND BAAJA BARAT (B3) is also a similar tale of two youngster and it's not surprising to see that it's doing wonderfully well with its target audience. The box office collections only dropped 10% in the second week against the industry average of 65% this year. JWM actually had higher collections in the second week of its release and in some centers B3 has higher collections than first week. Things might change with the release of TEES MAAR KHAN though. Coming back to the movie, the first surprise was a house full theater on the second weekend of release. The only seat I could manage to get was in the first row and I had to watch the entire movie with my neck looking up at 80 degrees angle. Precisely why I won't be able to write much about cinematography because every shot from that seat was a low-angle shot.B3 is a romantic comedy, which is not a genre which I usually enjoy especially after going through the agonizing experience of watching I HATE LUV STORYS. When I watched the promos of B3, I had a feeling that it will be on the same lines especially when I do not have much respect for Anushka Sharma. I still decided to watch it based on some positive reviews I read.It was a good experience. It's a refreshing and highly entertaining outing. It's not the award winning effort but it delivers on the promise of keeping you interested till the end. Mainly, it's the directorial treatment of Manesh Sharma which has made a simple story worth watching. Slightly inspired by THE WEDDING PLANNER as far as central idea goes, it's original and genuine. A lot of attention has been paid to detail, from art direction to dialog. Check out the underwear on ropes in the men's hostel. It's funny.The cause is also backed up by entertaining music by Salim-Sulaiman who are on a better run for the last two years. The background music by is one of the best I have heard this year barring Dabangg. Choreography has Vaibhavi Merchant written all over it and it adds a big plus in the entertainment factor of the film.The film has a two film old female lead and a new comer. While the slightly senior Anushka has done the best work of her short career, the film belongs to the new-comer, Ranveer Singh. Where Anushka has worked really hard on mastering the tapori style and Delhi lingo, her role is quite similar to the one she had in BADMASH COMPANY earlier this year where she again used similar body language and lingo. Nothing to take away from the decent effort she has put in though.Ranveer is fantastic. He is a trained actor who has waited for the right film to make debut and will win directors as well as audience with this performance. He is not traditionally good looking but the way he fit in his role was commendable. Neil Nitim Mukesh needs to see him to know what tapori is and not what he was in LAFANGAY PARINDAY. Watch out for Ranveer in coming films. Effortless acting and effortless dancing. If he doesn't make decisions like Vivek Oberoi, he can be a real threat to at least Imran Khan and other less talented actors like Neil Nitin Mukesh. Ranbir Kapoor I believe is safe when it comes to talent. Ranveer will already be challenging Ali Zafar for the best new comer of the year for sure.The supporting cast is bloody good. Neeraj Sood as Maqsood is effective but my personal favorites were Revant Shergill as Santy and the guy who was Ranveer's room mate in the hostel.On the whole, I had a lot of fun watching B3. Its one of the better films to come out this year unlike the bigger names like KHATTA MEETHA. I'm glad it also left NO PROBLEM behind. Way to go, Youth!" 
" Band Baaja Fun Baarat","writing the first review of this movie... i must say that those who haven't seen this movie have severely under rated this movie... the movie takes you through a nice journey comprising of fun and emotions... Being a typical yashraj film, it never bores you even for a single second and the movie goes around very smoothly... With very less expectation i entered the movie hall but the movie turned out to be a good surprise of good package.. a very light hearted movie which will bring smile on your face and you will forget your tensions and all. Ranveer singh who is making his debut through this film deserves an award for the best newcomer in the industry as not for a single moment he has looked like a newcomer. With oozing confidence and good acting, he deserves accolades. anushka on the other hand is as elegant as ever.. with her acting skills improving every passing film.. from my side this movie is a thumbs up... watch and enjoy!!!!!" 
" Refreshing movie and a great debut","Went to see this film with my Mum with whom I often indulge with watching Bollywood films at the cinemas.I recently watched Break Ke Baad and I honestly wanted to shoot someone after sitting through 3 hours of that. But BBB is such a refreshing change and I immensely enjoyed it as did my Mum and the rest of the small audience. You can tell this film hasn't been promoted as much and distributed which is a shame because it's a great debut for both the director and for Ranveer Singh. The leads have done a superb job and acting out their characters and giving it that authentic 'Delhi' feel.It's not a remake of any sort and the dialogues will have you laughing out loud. The film has everything it's funny, endearing, touching, shocking and romantic.The songs are great and well placed and the story moves along smoothly. There are slight plot holes and perhaps certain scenes didn't need to be added or shown in full extent in terms of it being a Bollywood film but nonetheless it still works because both Anushka and Ranveer have done a fab job at emoting the chemistry and dialogues. Highlights are the Ainvyi Ainvyi Song and the Dumb Dumb Mast SongI've seen a fair few films this year and I will say this is in my Top 5 for the bollywood ones that i've seen.Give this film a chance, it deserves it." 
" A Decent Flick...","Debutant Director Maneesh Sharma makes a good entry in filmdom with 'Baand Baaja Baaraat'. This Romantic-Comedy has an interesting first hour, likable performances, soulful music & good direction working on it's advantage.'Baand Baaja Baaraat' is tale of 2 wedding planners, who later fall in love with each-other. The lead characters are amusing, but they speak the language one is able to relate with. Maneesh Sharma succeeds by making his characters feel as if they live next-door, and the screenplay by Habib Faisal is spot-on in the first hour. However, the writing in the second hour isn't that convincing and drags a bit, especially pre-climax. Music by Salim-Sulaiman is soulful and acts as a plus-point.Performance-Wise: Anushka Sharma is efficient. Ranveer Singh may not have the ideal Hero looks, but he sure is a natural performer. The chemistry between Anushka-Ranveer throughout is very good. In the supporting cast, Neeraj Sood is lovable and most memorable.On the whole, A Decent Flick, that easily makes a good one-time watch." 
" Absolutely Blown Away","So having loved music videos from India for a long time & seeing bits & pieces of Bollywood style films I was not surprised that after seeing the trailer for this film last fall that I made it my mission to see it. Literally I tracked this film to several theaters & then finally to DVD. Waited "Patiently" for netflix to get over the rush of so many people wanting this video & finally got to see it. It was amazing on so many levels. The chemistry alone from Maneesh & Ranveer was so enjoyable to watch. They just fit so well together on screen like their characters do in the film. The music which I now own as of five minutes ago (DVD soon to follow) is amazing because you get a little bit of everything. Dance, Rock, some slow but quickly picks up tempo. I am still reeling from how much I loved this movie but I knew I would from the second I saw the trailer. If you love a good story, great music, wonderful acting, beautiful weddings & just a really good film then you will love this one. The director right from the start has you pulled in to this film. The shots he gets in this film are just nothing short of amazing. I really like his style & the way he did his montage scenes. Recommended for anyone who loves an amazing musical style film!~!" 
" Fresh!","Band Baaja Baaraat directed by Maneesh Sharma is very good.The story is fresh.The screenplay is penned very well.The first half is smart and brave while the second half is bit slow paced and tends to get boring.The music is melancholic.Special mention of the dialogs and cinematography.The dialogs are smart,especially the one delivered by Ranveer Singh.The cinematography is striking.Performances-Newcomer Ranveer Singh acts very well.His comic timing is sure to be applauded.Anushka Sharma is very good,since her last two releases(Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi and Badmaash Company) she performed poorly.On the whole Band Baaja Baaraat is Fresh and Entertaining!" 
" No unnecessary Villains, No useless Side-plots and the Indians learn to make an entertaining Rom-Com !!!","I went to see Band Baaja Baaraat with very low expectations, especially when 90% of Indian Rom-coms have disappointed me with subplots, un- needed comedy clich√©s, villains and skeletal plots, and also the fact that Hollywood gives us a lot of Rom-coms each year from High School to Dysfunctional Family, we have seen it all, so I expected nothing new here, but when the movie started rolling, the realistic script, life-like characters and flawless direction lead me till the end like a ride I enjoyed a lot.The movie has a story we have seen in many movies, but the treatment is fresh and natural.In short, its story of two middle class people who start a business as wedding planners on principle that no emotions will be involved, now as predictable as plot may seem, there are few surprises but even the predictable parts have been done with utter taste of freshness that you feel entertained. For a romantic comedy, the balance between Romance and Comedy should blend and this movie does it perfectly.In acting department, the movie belongs to Anushka Sharma, she portrays her comic timing, dancing, emotions with perfection and dissolves in the role of Shruti, but no review is complete without mentioning the performance of d√©butante Ranvir Singh, whose confidence, energy and expressions held the movie together, the movie required very powerful performance from him and he delivered, in an year when star studded Anajana Anjani proved like piece of crap, Ranvir had tough task to bring people to theaters as a new-comer, but he showed the obsession towards his role. The rest of supporting cast has nothing much to do as I mentioned before sub-plots are none here, the movie totally focuses on Ranvir and Anushka.The highest point in BBB is the treatment of the subject by director Manish Sharma, directing a first-time hero and a Genre which is very risky in India, he gave the movie a realistic touch from the word go, no un- necessary snori-cams, close-ups, beeps, its just focuses on characters and the story, Manish Sharma is a promising talent and I wish he chooses future subjects carefully and performs with the fan-base he made from this movie.The Cinematograpghy and set designs are a-class as the movie is based on wedding planners and weddings in South Asia are all fun, the movie portrays the colors, beauty and freshness with perfection, the songs are according to subject though Ainwayi Ainwai song is regular on my car stereo from days.The bottom-line is that 2010 was a great year for Hollywood as Inception, Black Swan, Social Network and Easy-A were Eye candies, but the Indian cinema suffered, 90% movies were just run-of-the-mill stinkers, apart from MY NAME IS KHAN, TERE BIN LADEN, this is the 3rd Indian movie I enjoyed, watch it with your buddies or Girl-friend, its a fun filled ride till the end.." 
" Good movie but second half is little boring compared to the first half which is great.","You cannot watch this film without falling in love with Anushka Sharma first. Ranveer Singh was just lucky to have done this film which no one expected to work the way it worked. I still love the Anushka Sharma of Band Bajaa Baraat. The innocence she had before she did the plastic surgery was breathtaking.
The film is about the world of Shruti Kakkar who wants to become a wedding planner and she finds a clueless boy, Bittu who being forced by his father to come back to village decides to do anything to remain in the city. So, he joins Shruti in her dream. Soon their company becomes big and they start getting offers. But wait, the film is not about that. The film is a love story of Shruti and Bittu who keep denying to each other that they have started liking each other. They had a rule that they will keep the love and business separate but that plan goes the downhill and also the film for me.
Overall the film is great and I love the first half of the film. While the first half is a joyous ride, the second half is a cryfest. One emotional scene after another ruins the mood for watching the film. What saves the film is Anushka and Ranveer's acting and of course the beauty of Anushka. I think she had looked the best in this film and she had never looked more beautiful ever again.
Every song of the film is great especially "ainvayi ainvayi". I love everything about that song, especially the choreography and the beats.
The director Maneesh Sharma has captured the essence of Delhi which only one filmmaker has done before, Dibakar Banerjee. Maneesh excels in handling comedy scenes and establishing the characters but since he is from the Chopra gang, he makes the emotional scene less impactful and lengthier than required.
The film worked because of songs and because every guy I know fell in love with Anushka after the film. The first was the best part.
However, bypassing the small mistakes here and there, the overall movie was good. The music by Salim Sulaiman was excellent. The writing of Habib Faisal and capture the lingo of Delhites was a difficult job but he did top-notch work. The camera by Aseem Mishra was ordinary and there is nothing to talk about it. The editing by Namrata Rao is good in the first half but she could have easily trimmed the second half to make it more interesting.
The film well deserves the accolades it got. It made people take Anushka Sharma as a good actor and Ranveer Singh got his dream launch in a film that became a superhit. Not many youngsters are lucky to get that." 
" Amazing","Yash Raj Films started new trend after making romantic films of making films set in small cities, Band Baaja Baraat too falls in that league The film has a unique concept but the treatment is typically Yash Chopra type, yet the film is well handled must say. The film is well handled in first half, having moments of joy between the two as there get close together. In the second half all is well till it starts dragging in between but the end though typical is well handledDirection is good by Maneesh Sharma Music too was a big hit, Loot Gaya is the best song, My favourite is Aada Ishq rest too are goodRanveer Singh was very unconventional for his debut and leaves a huge impact giving a natural performance Anushka Sharma got her first solo hit in this film and did an amazing job though now such roles are become second skin to her rest all mostly unknown faces leave a mark" 
" Not Bad","I think this is a nice movie. The both actors acted nice and the songs are catchy especially "Main Toh Ainvayi Lut Gaya." There are some funny things in the movie. This movie contains a lot of references from other YRF Films such as Bacha Ae Haseeno, Tashan and Bunty aur Babli. You would expect this. This movie tells how marriage is done in different ways. Its kinda predictable but watch this movie with an open mind. Ranveer is cool, but he should not do any YRF films in my opinion because he has more potential. Anushka is sweet and Bubbly. The songs like I said are catchy. I felt that the pace could've been faster if they cut out songs because those songs are unnecessary. This film was not a copy of the Wedding Planner, so do not hate."
