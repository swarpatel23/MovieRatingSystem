" Super thriller!","This is an awesome thriller movie. Don't be swayed by the fact that is is not made by famous people,there are no super standard actors. It is nevertheless good.Story is about Pratyush, a banker whose wife feels he is not spending enough time with the family, and he gets involved in a murder he does not commit. He receives a mysterious call from 88 Antop hill and goes to investigate,only to find a wayward woman who gets murdered. Pratyush is then on the run, with intelligent cop Arvind trying to track the killer, and the hero trying to find the killers,avoid those behind him.The plot will keep you waiting till the end to know the mystery.Music is alright but that's not the most impressive thing.Watch it. I'm sure you'll love it." 
" Not an Indian horror movie!","A bloody (in more ways than one) whodunnit ffs! I got this film out because I saw trailers and thought, nice a possible Silent Hill (if you've played the games on the play station/xbox) type of film. Should be plenty of bad things happening.Alas, it turned out to be a drawn out whodunnit and not a brilliant one at that. Some people will figure out the 'killer', others just won't care when its eventually revealed. I was the latter.Acting was average by everybody, didn't know any of the faces and the storyline was bog-standard and monotonous. Filming was actually quite good and you could see some money was spent here. I gave the film 5/10 (and that's generous)."
