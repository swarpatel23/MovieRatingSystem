" good old WATCHABLE Bollywood love story...","I personally try to avoid love stories. But, because of my loved one I decided to go watch LBZ. And turned out it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. If you are in search of a Bollywood movie after a long day at work, LBZ is a considerable. Movie is very predictable. Also this story- line has been seen multiple times in Bollywood. But silly jokes here and there on top of good art direction and acting makes it watchable. Dia and male lead has really good chemistry on screen. It is also good to see new comers getting chances in movies. All characters are perfect in their roles. In short, 8/10 from me to this lighthearted movie for its spiced up Bollywood tone and specially GREAT music." 
" A feel good type movie.....","first of all... this isn't a great entertaining type bollywood movie... the movie as its title says have todays life biggest concern "love and relationships".. lead actors zayed and dia looks fabulous together and acted well too... also the other supporting actors have performed well and have a big impact in the movie.. story line is very much predictable but very soothing and likable, directors work is good too.. but the other or may be the best part of the movie is the music which is very good and have variety..cameo role of actors are impressive...on the whole this is a worth watch as it is lite on mind and leaves a smile on the face at the end..." 
" Repeatitive Love Story","What can we expect,every year bollywood releases lot of films,but this film is also same like others,in the ending they meet and she break her wedding.What is happening yar?
Actually,i just wanted to kill my time,so watched this film.But,I recomment please dont watch the film,No New.
Its just like,someone tortured me to watch the film." 
" Everything good except male lead","Movie was above average in story of such kind. Could be said good enough, and entertaining. Sometimes acting got a bit weak, and unnecessary plots and missed some necessary points to convince the actions further to the viewers and strengthen the plot. Male lead's acting was the weakest among others. He is quite an amateur actor even though he is from a family of actors. Showing SRK was completely unnecessary stunt except for TV publicity obviously, was a quite a awkward scene or script could have been tweaked and director could have done a better homework on presenting SRK, to make his appearance special, but not only for the shake of "special appearance".Since the main lead of movie, i.e. Zayed Khan's acting was too weak to give anything more than 2/10" 
" Too much sugar in the cup always makes a bad coffee.","Post "Monsoon Wedding" which came in 2001, Indian Marriages and plots written around them have been the hot favourite of Bollywood directors. But now after a decade of using it over and over again it has almost lost its charm and freshness. Still, the basic premise of a marriage holds a good potential only if you have something novel to showcase revolving around the event. And the most recent example of this statement is the success seen by few movies such as "Tanu Weds Manu" and "Band Baaja Baaraat".Unfortunately the current LOVE BREAKUPS ZINDAGI doesn't have anything unique to offer in the name of content and it very lazily tries to encash the same old concept of changing love interests during a wedding proceedings. But the film is not a complete washout since it has few positive points to keep you engaged at least for the first half of the film. To begin with it's a well presented film like a finely decorated wedding invitation card having the same routine message as usual. Along with talking about a normal love affair of Zayed and Dia, it also gives much time in its script to the sub-plot of a young guy getting involved with an elderly woman (Cyrus & Tisca Copra).No doubt, it has scenes which are taken straight out of real life with very likable and believable dialogues. But at the same time the script also gets confused between its main and supporting plot, where no emphasis is given to the later one towards the end. And as a result the second half of the film becomes entirely predictable and uninteresting with the same routine kind of sequences coming one after another which we have already seen several times before. Moreover, the biggest drawback of the film remains its hugely unbearable length of more than two and a half hours. And that is the second big & decisive mistake made by its director after his first one of choosing an ages old rotten plot for his fresh movie.However, the few bright points in LOVE BREAKUPS ZINDAGI are its eye catching frames, beautiful and believable outfits and the ravishing Dia Mirza, who cheers you up every time she is there on the screen with her gorgeous smile. The Cinematography deserves a special mention here related to the above mentioned visual merits of the film and so does its rich production design which is appealing. Music by Salim-Sulaiman is though above average but also nothing exceptional relying heavily on a Remixed Govinda Hit "Main Se Meena Se Na Saaqi Se".Performance wise its surprisingly the best film of Zayed till date, where he has actually shown some talent, rather than just being stylish as usual. Cyrus as his friend is impressively natural and leaves a mark too. The rest of the male star-cast does well but the truth is that LBZ actually belongs to the ladies alone. It's a Dia Mirza film all together wherein she dominates with her pleasant performance right till the end, but sadly never gets to do even a single new scene throughout the film. And for that she should strongly blame both her director and the writers for wasting a fine opportunity by choosing such an overused plot for their film. Tisca Chopra delivers yet another fine lovable performance as the intelligent over-age lady and unarguably remains one of the few merits of the film. Interestingly LBZ also has Shabana Azmi, Boman Irani, Ritesh Deshmukh and even Shahrukh Khan in a short cameo. But the fact remains that no reputed cameo of any kind or grandeur can save an otherwise uninteresting film which is just glossy in its presentation without any basic soul. In fact LOVE BREAK ZINDAGI can easily be compared to a badly made coffee which is too sweet in taste but it does have a beautifully carved cup, painted with many bright colours, kept nicely on the table. So if you are game for tasting a coffee served in that manner then you can surely try the film, may be just for Dia Mirza alone." 
" Not so entertaining love story","Watched this movie on Netflix because I had nothing else to do. A rather poorly made love story. Both hero and heroine are pretty but not very good actors. Zayed fails to show a Delhi guy. He just doesn't have the dialogue delivery to be convincing. Dia Mirza has a pretty face but she can not act. She is rather unconvincing as girl who is torn between two guys. Songs are forgettable and dances are pathetic. Overall this movie is a waste of time." 
" A Simple, Sweet Romantic Film!","'Love Breakups Zindagi' is A Simple, Sweet Romantic Film, that has its heart at the right place. Its lighthearted tone, is nicely complimented by decent Writing & convincing Performances.'Love Breakups Zindagi' Synopsis: A couple and many of their friends experience changes and challenges in their respective lives after attending a wedding.'Love Breakups Zindagi' is predictable, no doubt, but there's no denying that this tale is genuinely sweet. I liked the characters, be it the leading couple, or the supporting characters, they all add to the lighthearted narrative. Sure, the second-hour is a bit too long & the film could've been trimmed, but overall, the goings-on don't bore & remain simplistic. Sahil Sangha's Screenplay is good, although it could've been crisper. His Direction, on the other-hand, is finely done. Cinematography is perfect. Editing needed more sharpness. Music by Salim-Sulaiman is wonderful.Performance-Wise: Zayed Khan & Dia Mirza deliver natural performances. They pair well & their on-screen chemistry, is consistent. Cyrus Sahukar is first-rate. Tisca Chopra is effortless, as always. Satyadeep Mishra is decent, while Pallavi Sharda does well. Farida Jalal is lovely. Among the cameos, Boman Irani, Shabana Azmi, Ritesh Deshmukh & Shahrukh Khan, lend good support. On the whole, 'Love Breakups Zindagi' is surely watchable."
