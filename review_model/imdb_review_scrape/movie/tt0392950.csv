" Old wine, new bottle","Coming from Bipasha and Dino Morea, who usually give fresh and scintillating flicks, this movie was an absolutely stale product.  I think this was their first movie but it took a while for it to be finished.  This has the same, stupid storyline.  Dino keeps on suppressing his love for Bipasha for the most retarded reason.  I somehow feel like the the theme of this movie is something idiotic like, It's okay to fall in love, but ask your parents first.  The songs are as lame as the movie except for "O Soniya."" 
" New Twist on a oldie.","It's cute but lacks emotional depth. Good performances from Bipasha and Dino, with no actual help from any of the other actors. I really enjoyed the beginning when there was lots of conversation and flirting between the actors, but as the film continued some of those sparks were lost and it was just a film begging for the end to come. Bipasha and Dino were surely much better in "Gunaah". However, this was better than "Raaz", so it's all about opinions I suppose. There is no violence and extreme drama, as most Indian movies have. However, it is a light and airy film, which is good for those days when you want to watch and Indian movie without the emotional baggage that comes with it. Costumes are great, not overly westernized with overly-seen-big-brand-names-everywhere or easternized with tacky-multi-neon-colored outfits, and the bowling scenes are pretty corny, but all in all, it's decent. Watch it." 
" Don't try to simplify the love lost between Hindus & Muslims of India!","Your film will flop if you do so! Bipasha Basu and Dino Morea are here again in one of their 4 films together (Note: to Bips, you need to stop making tons of films with your current boyfriends, it gets annoying from time to time and looks desperate once you've broken up with them).Anyways back to the film. The main plot of the film deals with the father of Khushboo (Basu's character) and the father of Arjun (Morea's character), their friendship forms the basis for everything that goes on in the film. Khushboo's family is Muslim and Arjun's family is Hindu. Arjun, a typical Mumbai dude is the sort of boy whose parents have to chase around in order to keep him at home but one day they are able to con him into going to Lucknow with them for Khushboo's sister wedding. Along the way he bumps into Khushboo via a series of Bollywood film clich√©s (ie. the pure looking Indian girl with the wind in her hair, walking down the street and being a good Samaritan by helping an old person cross the street + a bunch of old men sightseeing and the minute they come across Arjun they lend him their binoculars with which he uses to spot Khushboo the virginal and beautiful good Samaritan) and I have to say though having seen countless other films in which Basu has been typecast as the signature sexpot vixen, it's a breath of fresh air to see her in a virginal-happy-go-lucky-girl-next-door role. Her signature venting scenes are not left out of this film though, if you know Bipasha Basu characters, you know that at one point or the other they're always upset. ;-) Anyhow, Arjun and Khushboo fall in love but for some reason (bad script *alert*) Arjun claims he cannot compete with the friendship and love his father and her father share so he knowingly eludes his destiny with Khushboo instead, which results in a series of catastrophic and tragic events."
