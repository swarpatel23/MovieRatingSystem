" yeh filmmakers apni harkato se kab 'Baaz' aayenge.","If it's a thriller there has to be a killer. If there's a killer he has to be psycho. If he's a psycho his mental disorders shows off only towards the end (while he behaves quite normal in the rest of the film). This is the patented, oft-repeated formula being used in every other suspense flick. A mayor (Jackie Shroff), an inspector (Sunil Shetty) and a painter (Dino) are in love with an architect (Karishma) at varying degrees. And then there's a serial killer on the move. But you have to choose the killer from the three men itself, as there are no other characters in the movie (So your search becomes much easier). And check the killer's modus operandi. He first whips the victim, then injects a sedative and finally stabs her. Also he leaves the needle and dagger next to her dead body as his trademark. Moreover, the killer has an underground den where he stuff's his prey's body in frozen pods. Only if these cotton-wool water bodies in neon lit chambers weren't so bizarre, the audience would have given a thought about getting scared. And it's not the least difficult to guess the killer's identity. A term called Editing is completely absent in this film, for every scene has been blown out of proportion, while some being plainly unnecessary. And the director's tendency to go overboard with the action scenes in the finale just leaves you with thoughts that when shall the Exit doors open. The noisy and screechy background score makes you realize the importance of silence.Final verdict: yeh filmmakers apni harkato se kab Baaz aayenge." 
" crap","Can they be a worst thriller then this??????The film is simply crap Tinnu Verma an action director tried and failed to make a thrillerHe made every character suspicious which looked weirdPlus a weird love angle between Preeti and Suneil which includes a long dream scene wherein the killer is caughtThe movie tries to catch your interest but it failsThere are several loopholes The climax is the worst part Tinnu Verma does a terrible job Music is badJackie Shroff is decent, but his role is shaky Suneil Shetty fails and overacts badly especially in the climax Dino is awkward Karisma irritates Preeti too stumbles" 
" B for Baaz, B for Bogus!","Baaz - a bird in danger; the title suggests a thriller film. Well,it is a mystery thriller. But not really upto the mark.Story revolves around a mystery killer in Nainital who brutally murders only good looking women , and when a lady comes there to work, the killer tries to get her, with the city Mayor, the City police and a Loafer behind her for different reasons.The Good: The first 3/4th of the film, some action sequences, Sunil Shetty and Dino Morea's acting, the scenery of Nainital.The Bad: ALL THE SONGS AND CHOREOGRAPHY, the climax,inexperienced acting by the ladies. Believe me, these are terrible!The first 3/4th is thrilling, but all the songs and dances crop up without reason. Jackie Shroff's role is not given much importance. There was probably no need for Jackie Shroff in this film at all! And the climax is quite absurd. The makers should've come up with something else.B for Baaz, B for Bogus!" 
" Decent Psychological Thriller","I watched it with very low expectation based on the other reviews, but ended up rather enjoying the movie, inspite of obvious cheesiness and corniness at various points. Suniel, Jackie and Dino Morea all did a fairly adequate job as their characters demanded. Karishma was over-the-top melodramatic with histrionics to match, but looked fit and in shape for the role. The suspense did carry throughout, and the action sequences and stunts were pretty well rehearsed and realistic. The psychology angle was not all the far-fetched, and the whole nature vs. nurture debate was addressed as well, fleetingly though. I commend Tinu Verma for coming up with a novel idea and impressive stunts and action sequences, his product was still fresh. I am just sick of the mushy Rahul-Raj happy-go-lucky romance movies that have been pervading the Indian cinema for long. Not a bad watch on a lazily relaxed weekend night."
