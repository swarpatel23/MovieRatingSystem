" The best Indian thriller","I was amazed by this movie. I won't say too much to give away thought but this movie shows how ambition can become obsession. With the Indian film industry and the mob as a background, it also shows the struggle of those who want to make it big in the industry. It is Bollywood's best thriller so far! Full of suspense and great performances! I think Mahima Chaudhry is the only actress today who's done nothing but good work (and who's still struggling with success). Her movies are really full of surprises (and she also gives pleasantly surprising performances. It's a pity and a real shame on Bollywood that the film didn't succeed! India's best thriller has gone unnoticed! The only other Indian thriller that I'll put on the same shelf is Teen Deewarein. But there's still hope for this one and hopefully people will watch this movie otherwise they really don't know what they're missing." 
" excellent movie made after many years","The film is a movie which really keeps u spell bound almost all the time.i have seen this movie thrice now and every time i watched it i could understand the technical level of the movie better.the whole credit goes to the director.If u take the story of the film,its a total new concept which of course requires a great effort to act in and i must congratulate all the actors for their wonderful performance.But the performance i enjoyed the most was of Vaibhav.He has managed to give an excellent performance.He also could connect with the audience very well. I look forward for more brilliant performances from him in the upcoming years.Best wishes to the director n every member of the movie associated." 
" A Brilliant un noticed piece in all the noise","If you believe yourself to be a entertainment and watch movies for more than just time-pass i recommend this movie very highly. It has been quite some time since i caught the movie and wow! what a delight! I for these rare times nodded my head in sadness when many critics mourned the poor run of the film because of its low publicity. One of the few films which i wished i want to see in a cinema hall as the movie. Many actors except Mahima Chaudhary are lesser known but such deserving actors especially after this film.The end really blew me off and was on the mark.A good suspense thrillerWhat a film...seriously guys...do yourself a favour and watch this" 
" Taking Extreme Measures To Make A Movie","Junaid Memon's 'The Film' is refreshing and engaging, With an innovative story that is impressively told and that builds well on suspense we get a glimpse of the lives of eight characters. Seven of them, an aspiring writer, director, composer, singer, music director, actor, and actress are struggling to make it in the film industry. They live together in a little house with their kind landlady (who hasn't received rent of the last five months). Years go by as the seven strugglers continue pursuing their dreams while constantly getting rejected. Soon aspiration becomes despair that lead to extreme measures.I don't want to give away too much as it it important to maintain the surprise element. With the film industry and the underworld in the background, Memon gives the viewer an idea of what it's like to struggle in the industry and how corruption influences, not only the big shots but also the strugglers. This is perhaps Memon's tribute to those who work hard to make it in the industry which is a dream for so many.'The Film' is quite well executed, especially the stunning cinematography. The writing is superb. Though it isn't very difficult to predict the who-dunnit, it is the why-dunnit that astounds. The dialogues are good and the characters are fleshed out well. The songs aren't anything particularly memorable but they are a good fit in the movie.Mahima Chaudhry, Ananya Khare, Sulabha Dehspande are excellent in their roles. I've always admired Chaudhry for picking interesting movies disregarding whether it has a big star or not (even though many of her recent choices have been awful). Yet again here she gets to display what a chameleon she is. It's a really a shame that such a talented actress is struggling with success. Khare too easily gets into the skin of the character. Her Nandini is the conscience of the group and she does a great job in carrying the part. Deshpande is finally cast against type and given a meaty role to which she does full justice.Of the rest of the cast Vaibhav Jalani is very likable as the naive young actor. Chahat Khanna shows improvement since her previous film. Vivek Madan, Ravi Gossain and Khalid Siddiqui are adequate.I wonder what happened to many of these actors as I haven't seen much of them in later projects. In any case I hope they're doing well and manage to find something worthy of their talents. It's a darn shame that 'The Film' didn't receive much recognition. It's one of my favourite Indian thrillers and I hope Memon hasn't given up and that he comes back to make such great movies." 
" The Greatest Movie of all time","Once in a while a movie so special comes along, that it changes the world as we know it. This is one of those movies. Outstanding. In addition to being one of the most powerful movies of this century, it has also inspired me to become a better, more caring and generous person. North America is in your debt Anus Magillicutty. And I, for one, would like to thank the creators for giving birth to such a masterpiece, that as I soak in every ounce of this movie I lose my breath and shed my tears. The term 'best movie of all time' is thrown around a lot, but as of 2003 I think we have an answer to this much debated topic. So if you haven't seen this movie, go out and do yourself a service, and rent this masterstroke of film-making."
