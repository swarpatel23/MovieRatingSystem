" Damadamm!! A Decent Effort by Himesh Reshammiya","I watched this movie after very much Hyped Sci-Fi Movie "RA-ONE". RaOne is getting mixed reviews mostly negative in terms of story,acting and execution of Plot.I am quite depressed after wasting my money for a film that had powered by tons of VFX but there is no soul in the movie. So I decided to go Damadamm Too.And what to say, First time i thought HR has done a sincere effort in acting.Almost all things are there for a good entertainer.The cast is good ,Purbi Joshi,Sonal Sehgal and other supporting actors.Himesh has improved his acting skills a lot,there is no doubt but still more improvement is required.he has done almost all scenes with good efforts.Sonal Sehgal had looked gorgeous in the movie and she is plus point but the show stopper was Purbi Joshi.she is Damned talented and done her part very good.The music of Damdamm is very good no doubts better than RaOne in terms of creativity and melody.the songs were in good situations.The Naration was good, Cinematography was good.All the three looked good in movie.Dialogues are good.Himesh has done good job with dialogs.Swapna Waghmare has done good direction in debut film.Some flaws are also there in terms of acting and handling of scenes otherwise it is a treat.The romantic and comedy scenes are good.Its really a feel good film.Simple and Clean Family movie as suggested by Himesh.I request people to watch it once before any criticism and comments." 
" Interesting and beautiful!!","Got a chance to watch the un-edited version of this movie from a personal source. It is awesome!! It is so beautiful and entertaining, and has almost all the elements of a good entertainer. Nice songs by Himesh in his non-nasal voice, good performances by the whole cast, and above all, an excellent direction by newcomer Swapna Joshi.I'm not ready to say more about the story, all I can say is, it is about life. It is about loving life and finding joy in small things of life. The characters are simple and are well moulded. There are quite a few dialogs which will really touch your heart.Swapna Joshi's direction is the soul of the movie. The way she narrates the story, and the way the story unfolds is very impressive. The movie seldom bores the audience, it is interesting in almost all the parts.Himesh Reshammiya has improved a lot in his acting, and this is his finest performance, after a good Radio and a not-so-bad Kajraare. He has some really good scenes in the movie, and he has also written the dialogs of the movie. Sonal Sehgal has also got a meaty role to perform this time, and has a good chemistry with Himesh. The other artists have done well.On the whole, this movie can make a change in people's perspective about Himesh, if marketed and released properly. Hoping for the best.." 
" Amazing","Good Comedy by Himish Rashimiya Amazing Actor only for this movie He is Back Keep it going Himish Bhai!!!! so the movie it about two girls that likes one guy that is Himash R. HR your officially back watch this movie at your house it is definitely better than Aap Ka Surror and the other craps he did for example Karzzzz but out of all of them this is the best one he ever did. So i think the pros about this movies is it is his best movie he has done, it is a comedy that is the biggest pro and it is a good movie! so what else happens is he goes and sing madusaala the songs are just amazing and let me say this one more time Himash Bhai your back!!" 
" Surprisingly, this is not bad and much better than many big duds.","One of the few important and basic principles I have learned in the creative field is that you should never under or pre-estimate anyone for whatsoever reason. And the lesson once again came ALIVE in front of my eyes as I watched DAMADAMM â€“ the latest creation coming out of the house of 'over-famous for the wrong reasons'- Himesh Reshamiya.In true words, many of you may not like to watch his film, considering it as a waste of time even before seeing it for your various reasons. But the harsh truth is that this time, the singer turned actor-producer and his director Swapna Waghmare actually deliver a product which is much better than many other big budget movies with many saleable stars in it, who literally take everything granted in the name of comedy and cinema. Admittedly DAMADAMM isn't a great movie or a very brilliantly made project based on any new subject. But its surely isn't a bad movie too if compared to many other recent silly ventures presented before us by some big production houses with huge reputation. In simple words, the film may not be Great, but it at least doesn't try to make a fool of the audience sitting in the theater. Revolving around the plot of an over possessive girlfriend and problems arising due to her over-obsessive nature, DAMADAMM has a simple script talking about the subject in a realistic manner. The characters seem to be straight out of our day to day life with whom we can easily relate to and that is biggest reason why the film cannot be termed as BAD on the whole.The project instantly reminds you of all those simple yet effective classics made by Basu Chatterjee a few decades back. In fact the script of DAMADAMM seems to be just perfect for another Amol Palekar movie of the seventies when we had gems such as "Rajnigandha", "Chhoti Si Baat", "Chitchor" and more. But considering it from the current trend's point of view, it remains too simple, without any surprising twists in the story and lacks the pace as required. Moreover after a while it all becomes easily predictable as usual which takes the spirit away from its likable plot.Coming to the major weak points of DAMADAMM which actually bring down the movie to the level of just average, I have to mention its confusing genre which hangs between a comedy and drama. At times it clearly gives you an indication of a deliberate attempt being made to convert a decent plot into a comedy. Plus it also has too many songs forced into the narrative along with Himesh Reshamaiya himself, who in not convincing at all in the lead role. The director could have easily edited out few of its uninteresting songs hampering the pace, but since it was a HR's own film so they had to stay there to bore the viewers like the MANGO track. Also I couldn't understand what was the use of exploiting the most famous song of the soundtrack 'Umrao Jaan' in the end credits, after everything gets over? Apart from its avoidable songs, if only Himesh could have resisted the passion of acting in the movie himself, there might have been a different story to tell here in the review. Because if truth be told, Himesh is there in the film just like a wrong size tyre, forcibly fitted in a car along with the rest 3 good ones. So, DAMADAMM has Purbi Joshi as the impressive possessive lover (and she is really good in her act), Sonal Sehgal as the understanding loving third angle of the triangle, a simple-realistic plot and some good foot tapping songs to build up the show together. But it also has Himesh in the lead who really struggles throughout the film in order to match the other performances. No doubt the man has been blessed with a great talent of music by the Almighty, but acting is a different game altogether which he urgently needs to understand. Here I would like to mention that with DAMADAMM, Himesh as a producer undoubtedly proves that he has got some sort of understanding of choice of subject for his movies. So he is in fact quite capable of producing reasonably good films, provided he casts some other suitable or new actors in the lead and confines himself to only an important cameo in the script. And that's what makes me positive in expecting a real good project coming from his home production soon. Nevertheless, returning to his latest venture DAMADAMM, you may like it or not but this is not bad and much better than many big recent duds with huge stars in it." 
" Gets everything right...oop, I mean WRONG!","I got to watch this movie for free. I was hoping it was a bad dream because the entire movie was a nightmare!!! I didn't want to sit through it all. I was at the point of getting the hell out at the 20:00 minute mark, 22:00 minute mark and every 2 minutes after that until, finally the movie was over. What can I say about the plot? It's a confused mess...here's the whole plot (Himesh is the star employee in a film production company and has a live-in girlfriend too. Life looks good except for the fact that the girlfriend is over possessive and loves to keep him on a tight leash. When she goes on a family trip to Indore, Himesh suddenly discovers the joys of freedom and finds a new friend in Sonal Sehgal, the proprietor's sister. Will he be able to get back to his old, suffocating relationship?). The whole movie is a confused mess. It was probably meant to teach one how to enjoy the little things about life. But, all it does is...practically, make me wanna kill myself. I mean, right when his wife leaves at the start, Himesh starts checking out girls. I mean, that's not right.Next come the performances. Himesh sir, please stick to music. NO NO NO to acting. Your acting sucks! Stop trying to prove people wrong. They are NOT wrong. expressionless comic performance. The girls actually get the performance right. That's why I'm giving this a 2 instead of 1. But, that's not even close to enough. That's like cherry on top of a piece of crap! Music...eh...nothing bad, nothing good. So-so. Liked the beat in some of 'em, but, the lyrics are just horrendous. So, PLEASE, take my advice and stay away!"
