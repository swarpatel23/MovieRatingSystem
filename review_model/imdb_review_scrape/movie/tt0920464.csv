" Hindi Cinema's Most Under Appreciated Gem","First things First, if I need to describe Path Breaking Cinema, I will use Manorma Six Feet Under as an example. And this film is not a Direct lift of Roman Polanski's famous hit Chinatown, Manorma hold on its own. The first word that comes to my mind while I intend to describe this movie is Efficiency.There have been few thrillers that so effortlessly thrill you, keep you right on the edge of your seat, get you acquainted with such rich characters yet manage to knock you with killer twists and pull a fast one on you. Endlessly inventive, this is not one of those films that are just that. It explores the psychology of being a wannabe spy like no other film.Abhay Deol is in a role thats tailor made for him, he's such a natural actor, he brings life to Satyaveer Singh and you feel that Satyaveer is a small town Rajasthani and you never feel that the character actually is played by a Punjabi Jat living in Bombay.This is Navdeep Singh's first film as a director, and it is apparent he has the heart and soul of a storyteller. He never imposes himself upon the film; he just lets the narration flow effortlessly. He seems to be an actor's director, and the finesse with which he handles them, in close ups, dealing with each other reminds me of Steven Soderbergh.Gul Panag is one of the Finest Actresses in India today (Lot more talented than a Rani, Priety & Aishwaria). She already proved it with Dor and now in Manorma in a not so significant role, she still proves why she's the most underrated actress in the Hindi Film Industry.Vinay Pathak, Kulbushan Kharbanda & Sarika are competent too.Only Raima Sen hams here.Anyways a 9.7 out of 10 from me for this Masterpiece.Too bad for most of my friends who had to settle tor Over The top Nonsense movies like Partner, Hey Baby & Welcome while I loved every bit of Manorama." 
" Beyond the Illusion","After 'Johnny Gaddaar' here's another amazing thriller. 'Manorama 6 Feet Under' is clearly an inspiration of 'Chinatown'. Note inspiration, not ripoff nor remake. In one scene you even see Chinatown playing on TV. The writing is clever, the visuals are impressive and the performances are very good. Director Navdeep Singh stays with his sub-heading 'In the desert nothing is as it seems'. So in 'Manorama 6 Feet Under' nothing is indeed as it seems. Singh smartly unfolds the mystery and springs a lot of surprises. The film is set in sandy Rajasthan which is portrayed as mysterious, dry, isolated, illusive and frightening. Thus, it's a perfect set-up for the film.Coming to the performances, Abhay Deol scores again in yet another different role, not just different from what he's done but also from what other actors of today are doing. The actor is certainly here to stay and hope he continues the good work. Gul Panag has a simple role but she does her part very well. Raima Sen shows tremendous versatility. Sarika is stunning in the title role and Kulbushan Kharbanda and Vinay Pathak are very good.The songs are minimal. But the few that we have are pleasant and adequate for the screenplay.'Manorama 6 Feet Under' is one exciting puzzle and a treat to watch. It's bizarre. It's dark. It's funny. It's thrilling." 
" Read a book on screen","Manorama Six Feet Under is akin to reading a novel. Viewers who are not fond of reading might judge the pace of the movie to be slow. It takes a while to build the atmosphere, characters gets established, suspense builds up and races ahead to a grand finale.Screenplay and cinematography is commendable, you can almost feel the heat of the desert and sand on your face. A few places you can see the shades of Tarantino style of movie-making.MSFU is the story of Satyaveer who stumbles upon a mystery and the (failed!) writer in him itches to seek the truth Â– redemption or quest?Abhay Deol apparently is focusing on building his competency in the "new-age cinema" genre (there is too much competition in the mainstream anyway). As Satyaveer he puts on a convincing get-up coupled with a restrained performance.Gul Panag uses the usual sarcastic house-wife lines to portrays a convincing character.Vinay Pathak goes to shows that he is good at everything and not just comedy. Minor hitch here: why does he carry a strong accent while her sister doesn't? Convent studies maybe? Raima Sen character staunchly believes "Men and coffee are good rich" and the tension which prevails between Abhay and Raima over the game of snake and ladders is truly amazing, especially the come-hither passes.Sarika has a small but effective role. Its goes to show that acting is akin to ride a bicycle.Khulbhushan Kharbanda is as usual dependable.The two henchmen have portrayed their parts well (apologies for not knowing their names).Finally I must add that gone are the days where Bollywood used to paint the perfect world. Its emotionally gratifying to see just like true-to-life, the movie also depicts shades of grey." 
" a must watch suspense","Before watching Manorama, i considered Johnny Gaddar as best scripted suspense movie of modern times, but Manorama is far above from Johnny. The best thing is that the storyline looks real and on the level of a common person. It is not like a typical Hindi Cinema (bollywood) suspense movie with the protagonist playing a hero. I gave 9 because i felt detached in middle of the movie but approaching to the end, it captures attention and the climax is well written. I'll curse myself for not watching it for so long even after i heard its praise from my friends. Abhay Deol looks good as a Middle class Rajasthani and so as Gul Panag. Vinay Pathak is exceptional as usual." 
" best suspense Hindi movie of 2007","I saw this movie after johny gaddar and before seeing i liked johny gaddar but Manorama exceeded my expectations.. it was superb suspense movie with very normal background and yet it showed powerful message in the film.. till half way of the film I lost patience and interest but then again it started and I am glad that I did not left the movie at half way.. nowadays movies have big stars and beautiful backgrounds and splendid film sets.. this movie proves that big sets and good makeups are really not needed nowadays..(But the mass don't understand this) Good film needs good direction, good script and finally good execution.. Manorama deserves 10 out of 10.. but still can not give that as perfection is dangerous for ambition..!!" 
" Chinatown in the Rajasthan desert!","Manorama SFU is all about a somewhat corrupt junior engineer Satyaveer (Abhay Deol) who moonlights as a writer of detective fiction and lives in a small town in Rajasthan. His only published work is MANORAMA. He is 'happily' married to Nimmi (Gul Panag) and has a kid. One day he is asked by a woman called Manorama (Sarika) to investigate her husband PP Rathore, the minister of public works (KulBhushan Khrabanda). Satyaveer manges to take some photos of the minister and hand them over to Manorama. Strange events follow where she tells him she is being stalked and may be killed, tells him her age, and then dies. He is stalked and attacked by hoodlums but persists in trying to unravel the mystery with the help of Manorama's room mate Sheetal (Raima Sen). But nothing is as it seems, there is a doctor, a mysterious woman who wants to marry the doctor, the novel Manorama; the minister is connected to all this and to a proposed canal scheme. The plot twists and turns in a very ingenious and real way and keeps one wanting to know more and more. This mystery may have been inspired by Chinatown but it is very much its own film, intelligent, well paced and interesting.The cast gives commendable performances, Abhay Deol is wonderful, Gul and Raima are real and believable. Then there is Sarika - how does she look so good at her age? Vinay Pathak is great as Nimmi's brother and small town cop. The snooping neighbors, the hoodlums in the desert, the old Taxi Walla - the film does not miss a beat.The negatives? My version of the Shemaroo DVD had the most absurd subtitling that turned this excellent film into a farcical affair if you cared to follow the subtitles. But even with that glaring flaw Manorama is one wonderful film." 
" Manorama Six Feet Under : Movie Review","Manorama Six Feet Under is an intriguing, complex and offbeat thriller set in a sleepy small town of Rajasthan.The movie is a promising debut by director Navdeep Singh. People who are used to the escapist Bollywood fare may find the movie too slow or confusing. The fact is that 'Manorama' leaves many threads of the story open-ended. Even as it pays homage to noir genre, the movie stays close to reality. And there is a strong sense of impending doom throughout the film's narrative.The plot of 'Manorama Six Feet Under' takes a winding path instead of going linear. Beginning on a cogent note, the movie veers onto a somewhat tangled route, as the focus flits from one subplot to another.Verbally sparse, intelligent, and visually striking, the movie holds your interest despite its languid pace.And complementing the director's and cinematographer's commendable job are performances by the actors.Abhay Deol's natural and underplayed portrayal of SV lends a lot of credibility to the character. More than acting, Abhay believes in spontaneous performance. And it comes through on the screen.Gul Panag stands in equal stead, playing his bickering, nagging wife. Raima Sen , as the other woman in SV's life, is good. Vinay Pathak , playing a cop, doesn't have ample footage but he gets to mouth some well-written lines. Sarika has a very small role. Kulbhushan Kharbanda is impressive.Inspired from Roman Polanski's movie 'Chinatown', 'Manorama Six Feet Under' is a film for those who like unconventional cinema. At times bizarre, at times fascinating, the movie is arguably the first of its kind in offbeat Hindi cinema.Recommended for those who like offbeat films." 
" Unpredictive movie for select few ....not masses","This movie is a great piece of work though it is not meant for the masses. This movie has plot twists after plot twists and mystery after mystery, I generally am able to predict the direction of a movie quite early in the film, but this one was a major exception. The star of the movie is definitely Abhay Deol (this guy is definitely going to go places in the long run) with his authentic Rajasthani portrayal of the character -- S.V. The rest of the cast has done an exceptional job and full points to all the people involved in the making of this film. I would like to congratulate Navdeep Singh for making such a beautiful movie with a strong and authentic Indian essence. I would definitely recommend this movie if you are a mystery films buff." 
" Extremely well made movie","This movie is as real as it gets on the screen. The movie makers have done a great job to maintain the real feel and not dramatize anything. Every scene, every place, every character feels so real. For example, SV's bandage on his fingers is dirty and beat up just like the rest of his disheveled look. The table in Dr. Poddar's office has a transparent plastic cover over the table cloth just as you would find in many Indian households.The story is excellent too. Keeps you captured till the last scene. It is also funny at times. My only complaint with the movie is that I didn't like Raima Sen as the choice to play Sheetal's character. She has a heavy Bengali accent not suitable for her character. Also Nimmi(Gul Panag) delivers her "Hinglish" dialogues with an upper class English accent.Overall this is an excellent movie to watch." 
" Not for the average cine goer","FIRSTLY,I would like to sound a warning to those who see a movie just purely for the fun aspect or those who like fast paced fare. This is a movie to be seen in solitude preferably, as a bunch of guys would have different things to say about this movie and it may spoil the movie for you.This would be enjoyable, if you are willing to be engrossed in a movie and get in its mood. SECONDLY, I would like to commend all the actor's performances as they are all top notch.Rare to see a gem where each character is etched out perfectly.Even the two goons who torture Abhay Deol stay in your mind after the movie. THIRDLY, the director for making such multi-layered characters and selecting small town in Rajasthan for filming.eg Abhay is not your completely straight forward govt employee.his wife Gul Panag says its a pain running around and bringing up a child(screen maas rarely say such things in bollywood).The real winner is Raima Sen who looks completely gorgeous and performs the role of a dangerous beauty with ease.The movie works more better as a socio political drama rather than a suspense thriller. All in all a leisurely paced hard hitting movie definitely worth a watch. 8/10" 
" Manorama 6 feet under","This movie was released in India about a month back. I had heard that it is based on Roman Polanski's China Town. That, and Abhay Deol made me interested to see this movie.The story is more or less the same as China Town. The backdrop of the movie is the desert Indian state of Rajasthan. Satyaveer (Abhay Deol) is a government engineer who writes detective novels in his spare time. One day, a lady called Manorama (Sarika) comes and requests Satyaveer to spy on her husband Minister P.P.Rathore (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) for a sum of money. Satyaveer agrees. Later when Manorama dies Satyaveer realizes that Manorama was not the wife of the Minister Rathore. He be-friends Manorama's friend Sheetal (Raima Sen). Satyaveer realizes that there are further mysteries behind the whole episode. The racket of land grabbing, corruption, immoralities etc.The winner of the movie is its script. The first time Director Navdeep Singh has done a decent job in adapting China town. Abhay Deol has justified the role of a rural detective with great underplay. The pace of the movie is similar to that of China town, but the twist, suspense and narrative keeps us glued to the movie. There are no brutal scenes of crime, violence and sex (as in Johnny Gaddar that keep youth audiences glued), but still it has the subtle creepiness about the whole movie. This thrill is maintained till the very last frame of the movie.The music is okay and a few songs inserted in the narrative (which could have been avoided). The best part of the movie is the rural Rajasthan setting that brings a new dimension and scale to the movie. Sadly the movie is 35 mm, otherwise it would be a great pleasure to see the desert landscape and the colors on a cinemascope or 70 mm canvass.Abhay Deol has shown great acting potential with his underplay and sincerity. Still this are his early days, but if he gets the right opportunities he can turn out to be a great actor for Indian cinema.All in all, a very good movie experience. Nice to see Bollywood experimenting.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)" 
" Go Bollywood !!!","Just finished watching this movie. I must say that it has a very Coen Brothers feel to it. The director seems to be purposeful in the pace of this movie, being set in a sleepy town. You almost feel like you are in a place where there is nothing much to do, and the protagonist, rightly so , goes headlong into something that would take him away from his otherwise boring life. The acting is somewhat subdued , and I guess that is intentional too , making the storyline rise to the forefront. I thought the last half hour was the strongest part of the film, which unravels the truth. It does draw inspiration from Chinatown and there is a tiny homage to it during the movie , when a scene from the movie is playing on TV. Kudos to the director and his crew for making such a believable movie , far removed from the histrionics and unfathomable dance routines which Bollywood has subjected us to for eons !! HIGHLY RECOMMMENDED !!!!" 
" On rational lines...","I would rather first comment upon the length which would be a decider for anyone who has a healthy appetite for movies, a tad shorter would've made it better. Yet this movie delivers, let it come to you...nice and easy. And then anyone can realize how simplicity and realism has been imparted to this movie..no particular stellar performances but simple plot and a simpler yet smooth performance by characters makes it interesting and fresh(...no cheesy lines or regular bogged "bollywood" plot).Moreover its a characters portrayal not an actor's image snitching it. I say this movie is worth your 2 hours...and then maybe 10-15 mins more of it" 
" A Genuine Film Noir","Perhaps the best Indian mystery to date and a genuine film noir, Manorama is a movie that superbly captures life in provincial India, moving along at a deliberately slow pace, without ever getting dull.The movie has a near perfect script, backed by stellar performances from the cast (especially veteran actor Kulbhushan Kharbanda). But above all, its a movie that generously rewards multiple viewings. I've seen it four times already and every time I've observed something new. Nearly every shot has a symbolic significance; this movie could be used as a study of impressionistic photography.While it is a thriller superficially, Manorama is a film that poses several disturbing questions about human morality and existentialism. For connoisseurs of good cinema, Manoarama Six Feet Under has the elements of a potential cult movie.Sadly, this movies sunk without a trace at the box office. Perhaps it was a movie way ahead of its time." 
" Highlighly underrated movie","First I would like to tell who would surely like this movie, so if you are one of them then go and grab the movie right now - 1. People who have lived major part of their lives in a small town of India and know the slow and uneventful life. 2. People who have had great ambitions in life but some how could not achieve success in the magnitude of expectations. 3. People who are mystery aficionado not just in movies but in life also. 4. People who form their own opinion about the movies rather than just following the herd mentality. If you fall into any 2 categories out of the 4 mentioned above then its a movie for you. Review -This is one movie created by a very intelligent director who is absolutely comfortable with his intelligence and skill of movie making and does not go over board to show the intelligence. The plot of the movie is defined in a sleepy small town of Rajasthan. The beauty about the plot is that it shows a lot about a small town of Rajasthan without spending too much time in creating the backdrop. This is not just true for Plot but for characters also. The characters of this movie unfold with the course of movie and no extra effort is done by director to over simplify or over explain it. By the end of the movie you would be absolutely ready to answer any question asked about the character. Not because director told you all about the characters but because you would know these character so well. In terms of story its little slow in the first hour but if you fall into any of the above categories you would not mind waiting for next eventful hour. Once the story picks up the pace then you have to sit tight to assimilate all the details or you would get into the trap of post processing. Its not like a conventional suspense movie where you get to know the bad man at the end. Some where during the movie you would realize who is the bad man but why and how are the questions which will be answered later. In the initial part of the movie you would question why the protagonist of the movie is so confident and sure about his ability but you would get the proof of that by the end of the movie. At the end protagonist does not get fame or revenge or pleasure of killing the villain of the movie but you would have a subtle smile when at the end protagonist gives all the answer and takes sweet unconventional revenge. Acting wise it 10/10. Abhay Deol is a class actor, who knows his character in and out. Gul Panag has done full justice to her role. Vinay Pathak is as usual his best. But I think the credit goes to director who has carved out his characters so well that even you would feel that "I can also do this role, I know this person so well." At the end, its a must watch movie. Its a disappointment that this movie could not get commercial success but I guess that the fate of all great movies made in India." 
" A little slow but a good watch","Upon being suspended from his job as a small town writer, Satya Veerji(Abhay Deol) is visited one night by a mysterious woman( played by Sarika) who pays him to spy on her husband. Satya consults with his skeptical wife on whether or not he should accept this offer (which will bring them a lot of money, while his current status as a writer is pending investigation) but she is against it. Nevertheless, Satya ends up taking the job as private detective and enters into a life of deceit, lies and eventually murder. The film starts out very slow but if you are patient you are in for quite a well-acted thriller. Raima Sen and Vinay Pathak co-star."
