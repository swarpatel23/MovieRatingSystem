" Pathetic///","this is by far the most crappiest movie i have ever ever seen... one of the rare times where i was not able to continue a movie after like 15-20 mins.. otherwise i give a movie a shot just in case.. but couldn't take this movie at all...nothings right in this movie... be it storyline, acting, editing, dialogues, camera-work, direction.. you name it and its bad in this movie... i think i can shoot better with my hand held camera compared to this movie...this movie is a disgrace to Bollywood... or as a matter of fact to any film industry... they should ban this movie to be telecasted anywhere anytime...my request to all... don't even try to watch this movie if you love yourself.. its a complete NO NO NO!!!!"
