" What a waste of money and talent","With a tag line like "Love can kill", I expected some thrills out of this movie which had some talented names attached to it. Sadly what I got was a damp squib. This particular director has a habit of borrowing heavily from english films for most of his movies. In this case the Marky mark movie "Fear", a tale of a obsessed lover. The three principal characters are amitabh bachan, bipasha basu and John abraham. Amitabh is shown as a over protective father to bipasha who's studying at a local college. One rainy day bipasha encounters a group of bikers, John is one of them. He then follows her to a disco and then to her college and somehow manages to get a date with her. John has got all the bad habits one can think of, he hangs around with his hooligan friends stealing, drinking, going to brothels and beating up whores etc etc. Amitabh has planned something different for the weekend and takes the daughter away for a song routine at a scenic location. When Bips does not turn up he goes all wild and decides to show up at Bips house. Where as expected the lovers are caught by the Dad. Amitabh asks Bips to call him for tea, where Amitabh realises he has seen John somewhere, but can,t remember. The rest of the story is about how Amitabh finds out who John is and decides to save the daughter from his clutches. The story is nothing home to ride about and has been seen in a earlier movie of the same director "Inteha". Technically movie is slick. Music very functional. Amitabh is the only saving grace. Bips is badly miscast as the innocent lass. The talent shown by John in "jism" and "saaya" is missing mainly due to bad characterisation.After watching the movie, some of the  things which gave me heartburn are:On their first date when Bips does not show up, John ends up at place where Bips is, and they are suppose to be on holiday. How in the world did he know where they were.Later when he meets Bips he almost chokes her to death for not being there. Hello!! what does the director wants the viewer to think.He beats up the hooker like a savage beast. No complaint, No police report. NothingI dont have any thing against getting inspiration from hollywood movies, but one should get inspired not completely make a mess out of it. The director has done it in the past with movies like "Ghulam" and "Raaz" which were inspired but were well made in their own rights with some excellent performances by Aamir khan and Bipasha basu respectively.
This one is strictly for Amitabh fans only." 
" Fear/Cape Fear Melodrama","At least Aetbaar didn't involve a love triangle. I was getting sick of seeing Bollywood films with love triangles. On the downside, there is a love story as the focus, there is a lot of overblown melodrama here, there are songs as travelogues, and a bunch of other Bollywood clichés are present. Aetbaar is also strongly derivative. It's basically an uncredited remake of James Foley's 1996 film Fear, with healthy doses of the Martin Scorsese version of Cape Fear (1991) thrown in for good measure. But if it has to be derivative, those aren't two bad films to be derivative of. The more Bollywood thrillers and horror films the better in my view.Aetbaar is told primarily from the point of view of Ria Malhotra (Bipasha Basu). She's a college student "waiting for the right guy to come along". She says she'll know him when she meets him. She meets him (although she doesn't think so at the time) when he, Aryan Trivedi (John Abraham), almost runs his motorcycle into her. They run into each other again later, at a disco. Aryan keeps coming on strong, and Ria falls for him. Little does she know at the time that Aryan has an extremely obsessive, violent side and basically runs his own gang. We see the violent side early on when Aryan heads out to a whorehouse for a little extracurricular activity, and his idea of a good time is assaulting his host instead of making love to her. Ironically, Ria's father, Ranveer (Amitabh Bachchan), is a well-respected surgeon who ends up treating Aryan's victim. Ranveer suspects that something is off with Aryan as soon as he meets him, and his pleas, then demands, that Ria cease seeing him begin to grow stronger. Eventually, he uncovers some "dirty secrets" about him. Meanwhile, Aryan's behavior begins growing more threatening. Anyone who has seen a number of thrillers will probably be able to predict a lot of the plot from this point, and of course, anyone who has seen either Fear or Cape Fear will be able to predict it in a fair amount of detail.But insofar as Vikram Bhatt focuses on creating a suspenseful thriller, Aetbaar usually works. Of course Abraham is no De Niro, but he's psychotic enough in his own way. Some of the later scenes, especially those in the climax, can suffer slightly from pushing the envelope towards ridiculousness--for example, at one point, characters do the classic U.S. action film move of outrunning a fireball, but on the other hand, the less bombastic violent material works extremely well.The sets and locations in the film are attractive and suit the material well. The Malhotras' getaway home was particularly effective and the landscape was impressive cinematographically. Of course, the same sort of bucolic but atmospheric setting was used in Cape Fear, but that makes it no less successful here.Problems arise on two fronts. The more serious flaw is that Bhatt directs his cast to horrendously overact. The melodrama couldn't be thicker. There are a few attempts at comic relief, but those are just as painful. Bachchan, in particular, makes you want to cringe when he lays on the syrup, and his English "hip youth" spiel towards the beginning of the film is not only cheesy, but for some reason he's almost shouting with a bizarre, affected phrasing. That's a very minor moment, but such groan-worthy tangents are littered throughout the film. I wish Bollywood directors would more often stress underplaying a role. With that type of acting instead, Aetbaar could have nearly been a gem.The other flaw arrives with Bhatt bowing to various Bollywood conventions. Ria has to fall for Aryan for the film to work, but to conform to the standard Bollywood ebb and flow, Bhatt has Aryan strangling Ria one moment, and the next moment they'll be singing a travelogue romance song to each other--you'd half expect them to get married in the next scene while Johnny Lever shows up to tell a few jokes. The build up from Aryan as love interest to Aryan as dangerous psycho needs to be gradual, and once he does something like strangle Ria, she needs to approach him with a bit more skepticism, even if she still gullibly loves him and has a bit of provisional trust in him.There are also some very odd production design elements. For some reason, Ranveer has a piano on his patio, uncovered. Pianos aren't weatherproof normally. Maybe in the film, this one is supposed to be, but it's weird enough that it distracted me. Or, Aryan is supposed to be an artist. He's done some portraits of Ria. The first one he shows her is actually quite scary looking--she seems to be melting, as if it were an "acid portrait"; nevertheless, she's impressed, as if it were a normal painting. Again, these are minor points, but there are many of them over the course of the film, and in the general context, they are kinks in the flow of the thriller.There are also a few dangling threads; these should have been better developed. For example, Ranveer never does find out who beat up the prostitute, even though there's a great chase scene where he comes very close. It's just dropped after that. But that's also a backhanded compliment. It should have been better developed because the idea was very good. Bhatt, who also wrote the story, had no shortage of good ideas in his details, and he can create a lot of suspense when he wants to, even if the basics were cribbed from other films.Aetbaar is nowhere near a perfect thriller, or a perfect Bollywood film. But it is well worth a look, and if you're more sympathetic to the typical Bollywood melodrama mode and other clichés, you just might love it." 
" Thrilling but unrealistic","This movie does keep you watching. Unlike the typical bollywood movie, the story moves along rapidly in this one. So even though you can predict exactly what's coming next, while the traditional Hindi movie takes its sweet old time in getting there, this one gets right to the point.The story was quite unrealistic. I don't mean the premise, as that in fact was a pretty good one. However, the way the story unfolded was quite far-fetched and worthy of a cheap horror novel. Amitabh Bachchan gave a strong performance as always but the rest of the cast can't act at all. Moreover, the characters of Ria and her mother were unintelligent to an extreme. Especially the mother... I know they wanted to established that Amitabh as the father was the head of the household, but having the mother's character be this useless is well, quite useless.The only positive thing I can say about this movie was the looming dark feel it had to it. I haven't seen this in a Hindi movie since Aks and Sangharsh. This gloomy, evil, dark, helpless, "feel something in your stomach" shade is rarely seen in bollywood, and perhaps writers and directors need to explore it a little more. It works wonders in Hollywood, so why not bring it home? They bring everything else home don't they?Perhaps I'm being too critical. Perhaps the movie was only meant to be as good as it ended up being. All in all, not worth it. 4.5/10" 
" cheesy but good","i really enjoyed this movie i don't know how many times i've watched it but it's truly something for Vikram Bhatt fans Amitabh Bhachan's acting is great Robin Bhatt's screenplay is cheesy but i've seen that in his other movies and i appreciate him his abilities as a scriptwriter overall this movie can teach you about your relationships with your father or your parents it has some similarities with Inteha but it's definitely a different story and when you watch it you'll enjoy it i know i did 4/5 is the rating of this movie i give it really rocked songs were really great Udit Narayan's voice is beautiful along with others highly enjoyable movie" 
" Slick thriller","This was a slick thriller.  Amitabh, of course, gave another performance worthy of applause.  Bipasha perfectly suited and portrayed her role of a rebellious daughter.  John was a convincing psycho.  The trap scene and the climax were excellently shot and were edge-of-the-seat.  Amitabh and John's confrontation scenes were well shot.  Songs were really nice.  The movie was slightly reminiscent of the recent flick, Inteha. The only thing that didn't make sense was why Bipasha was falling head-over-heels for John when he's obviously abusive towards her." 
" Fear remake","Vikram Bhatt was going through a bad phase post APD when he gave a series of flops like Footpath, Inteha Aetbaar was sadly a follow up though it had a good cast. The film was stuck due to financial issues which resulted in it being delayed, In between Bhatt made INTEHA which had a similar plot with Amitabh's character being replaced by Vidya Malwade(as a sister). That film released 2 months before and tanked. Aetbaar released on the same day as Khakee and affected both at the B.O. Lets see the faults: The film has a weak script, First of all John's character is shown weirdly and never explained why he behaves like that. Bipasha accepting all the tortures works against her character Even the romance is unconvincing and also the songs spoil the show and don't go well with John's character. The film borrows from FEAR but sadly the impact is curtailed However the clash between Big B and John does work however the pace gets slow and the climax though well filmed is predictableDirection by Vikram Bhatt is letdown by the writers Music is not up to the mark and seems forcedAmitabh Bachchan performs his part well as usual, Bipasha Basu doesn't look the innocent girl she is playing but does a good job John Abraham tries very hard and does impress but his role is not properly written, His voice too was dubbed those days. Supriya is okay, Ali Asgar is okay too" 
" Above average, despite some flaws; different plot","The plot line is most welcomed, having the quality of being different from Bollywood clichés. The movie keeps you locked within, in spite of some totally-out-of-logic scenes and character reactions, that don't come with the slightest explanation. For example, Aryan's appearing at the vacation house. It was out of the blue, I guess the writer couldn't come up with a good reason for him to find the house so he just considered the viewer ignorant enough to go with the flow of the script. Another one is Ria's absolute confidence in Aryan. Even though he shows signs of serious mental problems (e.g. Aryan's burning the painting of Ria when she remarks it's more beautiful than reality; Aryan's chocking Ria after she left him waiting). I mean, come on, I understand that the character is naive, but not stupid! As a naive person she can trust in Aryan when he explains to her that he murdered his father for moral reasons (his father having tormented his mother for years and her mother finally dying because of it) but I don't think she's supposed to believe it's love when someone's stating he'll kill her if she were to go away and when he's actually attempting it at the slightest mistake. And the biggest thing that bothered me was the women's passive state when the man in their family was being attacked. I get it, it's a men's fight and the women are scared and all that blah-blah, but am I supposed to think that a woman would actually stand there dumbly, watching a loved member of her family die? After all, the 3 members of the family together would have taken down the 4 bad guys, one by one, a lot more easier. All in all, I liked Amitabh's performance in the role of the perfect, protective father that would lay down his life for her daughter's well-being. Powerful, forgiving, persevering, Bachchan impressed me once again, in Dr. Ranveer's character. John was also quite imposing as a madman. I've seen him as being silly, funny, romantic, emotional, but I could never have imagined him in such an antagonistic role. Maybe I should look up more movies of him. It's worth watching if you can get over some details. Makes you wonder about the depths of mental depravity and a parent's sacrifice for his/her child's happiness." 
" Excellent","This was John's Abrahams film, he plays a negative role and plays it really well, i remember watching this movie a couple of years back and i was really impressed with John's acting, he was only a couple of films old and was a model before he went into acting, my god he was good in this film, and i have loved John ever since.Hmm Bipasha , her performance was okay but she could have done better, i swear she bores me every time i see her on screen i just watch to change the channel, she does not show any emotion at all, Big B, well he was excellent then again he gives a 100% performance in all of the films that he does, the music was really good as well and i loved the soundtrack, this is a must see film and if you have not seen it go and check it out." 
" Thrilling and touching","This movie had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Not only did the sinister part hold my attention but also the loving devotion which the father had for his daughter. This movie is a must see! This film knocks down the familiar stereotypes which some may have of Indian parents, because we see love and devotion all the way. Also, the actors in this movie did a wonderful job. It's clear that this film was geared towards the father as the main focus, showing how he takes charge and protects his family when the need arises. After watching this movie I couldn't help but run into my father's arms to simply say, "thanks for everything!" Please give this incredible movie a try!" 
" AetBAAR baar nahi dekho!","Aetbaar Bipasha was one of the obvious reasons why I took this movie. Besides, I remarked to my dad that Amitabh is a lucky chap and there will be something in his movies. If I enjoyed watching Aks, I would definitely enjoy any stupid AB movie which has Bips starring in it! But frankly, this movie gave me much more.What's new: Not much except one or two situations and twists. I am gonna refrain specifying these as they could be potential spoilers. This is one movie where the feelings are brought out very naturally from a young passionate lover's perspective.Noticeable: Bipasha's acting is among the best in the industry when it comes to thrillers. The fact that she's so sexy just makes it better. She has given a very mature performance. So, has John Abraham. I am beginning to like this chap, he suits the stylish villain role better than most in Bollywood. The chemistry between the lead pair is terrific. I do not so much appreciate the loud sound of Amitabh's saliva between sentences. He's better reduce the volume of such sound effects! Verdict: OK movie although its not a Must watch!. Suspense/Climax is not up to the usual Vikram Bhatt standards, but not a bad movie." 
" A Brilliant Edge-of-your-seat Thriller with superb acting!","Regardless of the fact that this film may have borrowed or taken inspiration from a Hollywood counterpart, it is a Bollywood cinema achievement in suspense and superb acting! Amitabh Bachchan and John Abraham face off in this stunning thriller that involves a father (Bachchan) who has to save his daughter (played by Bipasha Basu) from the clutches of a wicked distraction (Abraham) with a dark past. If this film does not leave you at the edge of your seat as it climaxes, they you need to have yourself checked to see if your heart rate is normal like the rest of us. The three main protagonists are all stellar in their parts, especially John Abraham who will scare your knickers off in this psycho role he plays here. Bipasha is also excellent as a naive college student who defies her parents all in the name of love. It took me a while to like John Abraham again after seeing him in this, he was just too scary for comfort! Oh! and the songs are great too, especially the title number." 
" A Duelling Fest","Movies are influenced not copied and in this case, well influenced and directed. John Abaraham debuted in "Jism" and it is amazing how far he has come in span of few movies. In "Jism" he was wooden, here he has great depth and range almost matching the Veteran Bachchan. Hindi movies have been dominated by actors like SRK, Salman Khan who have neither the looks nor the depth to portray the diversity required for an actor. Last decade the Indian Cinema has been cheated,orphaned and greatly deprived of this diversity-in the younger set-where as we always had feast from the older actors like Bachchan, Patekar, Om Puri, Amrish Puri-just to name a few. Actors like John Abraham are filling this gap and Actors like him have heightened interest in the otherwise dormant Hindi Cinema. The movie showcases incredible dueling between Abraham (Aryan) Bachchan (Doctor Trivedi) and his daughter (Bipasa Basu). Bachchan is indisputable Icon who has a commanding presence in any scene in any angle-a born actor like Pacino-where as Bipasha most of the time looks like she is hiding a secret (seductively I may add), but she does emote well when called for,unlike actors in her class Ash Rai; who looks good but the woman cannot act period-which can be a handicap for a director the caliber of Vikram Bhat."
