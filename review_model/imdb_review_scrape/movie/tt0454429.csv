" Chingari - Woman Power!","'Chingari' could rightly have been called 'Sushmita Power' for she's the mainstay of the film. If fun time is what you're looking for in a cinema hall, then stay away from this film! And for all you die-hard Sushmita Sen fans, here's a different flavor of this woman to relish and cherish.You are sure to take home a slice of Basanti (Sushmita Sen) after watching 'Chingari'. The film is a close look at the goings on in a remote village in Northern India. So head for this film if you're in the mood for realism. But the film has a major drawback; its length. It could have been trimmed by at least half an hour and made crisp. Then it would have made a stronger impact! 'Chingari' has many layers to it. It's the love story of a prostitute and a postman. There are other issues too that are still prevalent in these remote areas in the North; illiteracy, sexual exploitation of the poor, and fake Godmen.There are some brilliantly executed scenes. Besides the performers, credit is due to Kalpana Lajmi, the director. Watch out for the scene in which Basanti goes to the post office a day before her marriage to confess her love to Chandan (Anuj Sawhney) and explain to him the reason for her agreeing to marry someone else is heart wrenching as well as performed from the heart. It shows the strong willed prostitute's transition into a woman.One could also never associate this sort of vulnerability with the normally strong and confident Sushmita Sen! It puts her in the same league as some of our great actresses. Another brilliantly performed scene is one in which Basanti takes on Bhuvan Panda in her house. And the climax in which she kills him is just superb. She looks possessed by the Goddess. It's almost like Sushmita had recently said, "It's not me, it's the Goddess herself!' Mithun looks like he's truly made a comeback. This sensitive actor had somewhere got lost in all those flashy clothes and disco numbers in his yesteryear's. 'Chingari' brings out the actor in him although he does go over the top in some scenes. Ila Arun fits the bill. Anuj Sawhney looks convincing. The kid who plays Basanti's daughter is cute. A couple of the songs are good. The background score is brilliant. There is a liberal usage of foul language, which goes with the genre of the film.But the box office prospects of the film cannot be predicted. It has limited appeal. But a movie to be watched for the performances, particularly Sushmita's!" 
" What's the purpose ? Get a national award for Sushmita Sen","I saw the movie yesterday night and i must admit i am not over the shock yet. One could but a night with a prostitute for 1 Rs and then one finds Ila ( Didi )taking three tenners from a customer, the postman reading a letter without address, characters coming in moving out without much reason... though there are clear indications that this movie has a single purpose..Get a national award for Sushmita Sen..and probably send the movie to foreign film festivals..portray India in the manner which no longer exists..and get some more awards.. Sushmita Sen shout screams over acts throws her child around and throws expletives at her ( it helps that the kid is her own adopted child ) ... How can a filmmaker spend so much of money and effort in such a movie ?? Any answers ..." 
" Mithun","CHINGAARI: Review by: Romuz Dear Members, I would like to share my opinion about the movie Chingaari, which I recently watched in a DVD. I was waiting for them to release in UK cinema but unfortunately they did not showed in a UK cinema. I am not a good writer so please forgive me if you get distract by reading my review. And also please don't take personally if you get upset with my review. I am just sharing my own opinion as a spectator. Cast: Mithun Chakraborty: Bhuvan Panda Sushmita Sen: Basanti Anuj Sahani: Chandan Mishra-PostmanThe StoryChingaari is the story of a young and innocent prostitute Basanti played by Sushmita Sen, Who is a humiliated, frightened and ravaged sexworker. Anuj Sahani plays the post man Chandan Mishra who comes as a crusader with innocent views. Basanti falls in love with the Chandan the postman, she dream for a relationship, but the same time she is not allowed to dream of a relationship with postman. Mithun Chakraborty (Lovingly called Mithunda) who plays Bhuvan Panda, a village priest. He misuses his powers, he tortures the village people and incidentally, he falls in love with Basanti. So now we can see Chinagri is based on three characters: Bhuvan Panda, Basanti, and the Postman. The film story is very interesting it's an emotional story of Basanti who dream falls in love with postman? This news spread to Bhuvan panda's ears. Then Bhuvan Panda torture Basanti. Basanti is helpless. Once Basanti dream of getting married to postman so her daughter Titli can live in good life grow up in good society. But Bhuvan Panda who heard everything and hints titli says, one day Titli will take your place when she grows up. That time Basanti get Spark of Revolution. She speaks against Bhuvan Panda. This scene is terrific. The way Mithun and Sush was expressing their acting. It's mind blowing.Then Bhuavan Panda kill Chandan. This is another challenging scene. Mithun look real devil when he kills Anuj. After that Basanti become Chingari and she get ready take the revenge. She fights Bhuvan Panda. My opinionSo let's talk about the Chingari. It is very difficult to write about this film. As I already mentioned I am not a good writer. It is very pleasing too see a very good and well made film after long time. I will not say it's the best film, but it's very nice movie. This film is women centric film. I think in India the public does not shows interest in women centric film that much. This film is for certain audience who like watching good cinema. The other advantage of the film is location. After long time I have seen a film set on the village. Recently we seen many Bollywood film has shoot in western country and mostly the story is more westernize. This film Chingari is has very good location and looks more authentic. It will be good for Asian audience who is living in western. Normally we are fed up of watching same kind of film like Kaal, Kal Hona Ho which has western effect and more stylish. Chingari is more like and authentic film. The costume the dance and songs are really great. I think the producer they must show in the over seas...The PerformanceMithun Chakraborty: Mithunda a three times National Award Winner. He did a tremendous job in Chingari as Bhuvan Panda. He was like a nature its self. He was mind blowing. Mithun was not playing the role of Bhuvan, he was Bhuvan. Mithunda is genius and unique... The Body language was precise. His lust for Basanti, the way he looks and the way he walk it was very precise only genius actor like Mithun can do such a great acting. Mithun prove to be greatest actor. I hope if he could win his 4th national Award. He deserves his 4th National Award. The chemistry between Sush and Mithun were fantastic it look so real. Mithun love Basanti and at the same time he hate Basanti being a prostitute. Mithun talks Sanskrit but some time he used foul languages which is acceptable. All Mithunda's fan will enjoy watching this movie. If you like his Jallad you must like this role. He is absolutely fantastic. I hope he will win an award.Sushmita Sen What can I say about her acting? I think this is her best role I have ever seen. She was awesome. Honestly speaking I never liked her in other movies, but she has proved her self she is indeed a talented actress. The role of Basanti she was completely into Basanti. I think this Sushmita sen's most cherishing work. She is very lucky to work with three time's National Award winner a living legend called Mithun. Sen should be pleased for this role. She has most fantastic role in her career. She did award wining performance. Anuj Sahani I always liked Anuj as a good actor. He is a fantastic actor. And he proved it in Chingari. He played his role with heart. He has put soul in his acting. There are few powerful scenes of Mithunda and Anuj. When Anuj speak against Mithun and Mithun killed him. That scene was great. Anuj was superb in Chingari. I think he also deserve an award, for supporting actor category.The directionThis film directed by Kalpan Lajmi. The screen play is not up to standard. She has got the right concept but she could've avoided some of the foul language. The performance of artist is fantastic. The music was very good. Dank Mare song is great.Performance: 10/10 Direction: 8/10" 
" Not Your Typcal Bollywood Musical","This is a high art film coming from director Kalpana Lazmi, who chose to take the risk of casting several actors who have arguably been considered by many as being past their prime by the Indian movie establishment. Taking place in a small village that worships the great goddess Kali, Lazmi's film presents a strong critique of the caste norms, and the concepts of purity and pollution that still control life in much of rural India today.In the lead role of the most popular prostitute in a small village, is the great Sushmita Sen, and she truly has turned in the greatest performance of her career up until now in this film. This role demands such intensity and discipline from her as an actress, and she convincingly brings us along: Celebrating her strength as the self-sufficient wage earning single mother, cringing through the abuse and humiliation she suffers at the hands of the village priest, weeping as we watch her fall in love with the young postman who befriends the women of the brothel.Ila Arun's role as the owner of the brothel is carried off excellently--all the way from her over-done make-up to her alternations between the over solicitous motherly nurturer and the cold-hearted exploitative business woman. This veteran actress is expert at portraying the caricature of a person that the madam of this small village actually is.Mithun Chakraborty's career is also revived in his role as the powerful but corrupt village priest. He allows the prostitutes to serve Kali through dance and by making offerings, but they can never touch the goddess' feet. At night he visits the prostitute, but he cannot deal with the truth of his own desires, and so subjects her to all manner of abuses during his visitations. Chakraborty's own stoic performance matches Sen's in intensity and depth. And the final confrontation between the two of them provides a scene of rare cinematic climax!! The goddess has truly come alive." 
" Powerful, fantastic performances, but still doesn't gel","First of all, hats off to the cast for giving such power-packed performances. I would say Sushmita did her best in this movie. Ila Arun was also sensational! This is truly Mithun's comeback film. He proved his high caliber and extraordinary talent, which I was completely unaware of. Elaan and Lucky didn't showcase his talent at all. The story is bold, and Lajmi courageously exposes an injustice in the Indian villages prevalent since the beginning of society where hypocrites like the priest played by Mithun thoroughly exploit the caste system and play the role of God, giving an ultimatum on every issue in the village while womanizing and abusing prostitutes at night. However, despite all of the film's strengths, these issues have been tackled numerous times in Bollywood. This film, particularly its climax, reminded me a lot of Daman. What is also irritating is that Chingaari is in the form of a narrative. At times it becomes extremely boring. I think Lajmi didn't do a good job converting from a theater production to a cinema format. I would prefer to see this on the stage than on DVD." 
" i'd give it 0 rating if i could","i tot kalpana lajmi, the director of films like RUDAALI, DARMIYAAN, DAMAN or KYON, would have given a decent direction and story for the film.. also considering that its adapted from a novel i think... well of course sush and mithun gave some good performance... sush the prostitute who falls in love with a postman... she was good with the emotional and outburst scenes and in some other scenes she was trying to be cute and chulbuli.. clearly having no continuity in her character development...and since the story itself is pretty controversial, some scenes could have been handled better.. i just ended up feeling grossed out and horrified... some very bold scenes too, makes u feel sad for the life of a prostitute, but later on when she is dancing and singing the bichua song in the mela, u get confused thinking maybe her life is a party after all.. and speaking of songs.. totally irrelevant.. as irrelevant as having chutney with chocolate... reminded me of David dhawan movies...the cause of the failure of the movie... everything.. the direction, story and actors.." 
" worst movie ever made","My only wish is that Sushmita Sen retire from acting and go back to her country village to practice the oldest profession.....for real! I won't mind paying a visit as long as she doesn't act hysterical like in the movie...from what I can tell , she packs a serious bite!As for Mithun , what can I say...hopeless ! Just stop acting now and save the world!I recommend a sports bra for mithun's man boobies. Initially I thought it was Sushmita who was topless....Ila Arun could use less pancake in her face...a visit to a maxilo-facial surgeon is recommended.The hero (postman) might never act in another movie but....given the talent of other actors in bollywood , I won't put it beyond him to become a bollywood superstar.One of the worst movies ever made...not that the Indian audience would know considering other Indian movies fare no better..."
