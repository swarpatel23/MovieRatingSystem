" Story of Hanuman (Hindu Monkey God)","Hanuman presents the first serious and truly professional Indian effort at animated movie making. Expecting Disney like finesse would be unjust for a beginner but the makers of Hanuman did an awesome job. One would get the glimpses of Disney's Lion king and Tarzan here and there in the style of animation.The story is something which every Indian kid grows up with, its the story of monkey God Hanuman, son of God of wind Varun and Anjani, he is an incarnation of Lord Shiva. The narration assumes the viewers knowledge of the Hindu epic Ramayana, so for those who have not heard of Ramayana would find certain parts of the movie indecipherable.Its a movie which kids are going to love and adults appreciate. Highly recommended for a full family fun. Highs: 1. Reasonably good quality animation. 2. Great music. 3. Does full justice to the theme. 4. Young Hanuman is super cute. Lows: 1. Presumes viewers' knowledge of the epic Ramayana. 2. Some more detail in the story telling would have been appreciated." 
" This is the ONE movie a 90s kid and early 00s kids have a SPECIAL place in their heart.","This is the best portrayal of Bhagwan Hanuman ever.Not even the live action portrayals ever this good.First the Japanese Anime Movie Ramayana and then this movie made Hanuman take special place in Indian kids' heart.It teaches kids morality, kindness, righteousness, goodness and bhakti.Don't think about other people or critics' reviews or ratings. Other reviews are given in 2005 and by old people. Only a person who was a kid at that time can give true review.This movie deserves 10/10. Couldn't have been 9/10 just because of animation comparison to other international animated movies but hey man, it's India first of all where animation industry has not even came out of womb and secondly it was 2005, approx 15 years ago.So this movie clearly deserves 10/10.I loved it.:)" 
" Decent","Calling this movie decent is a stretch of the word. The direction is choppy. The animation and editing is below par. The saving grace is that its based on a popular myth and the story is interesting." 
" India's first ever animated","In Hindu mythology, Ramayan is the most popular story ever told. And when it comes to Ramayan, then its not just Ram, Laxman, Sita and Ravan. There is also one more important character in the story - HANUMAN.Hanuman - who leaped for the sun thinking it to be a was a sweet fruit Hanuman - who was blessed by the GODS with supernatural strength Hanuman - who flew across mountains and leaps across the oceans Hanuman - who is the mighty warrior, the destroyer of the wicked Since the silent movies era, there have been number of flicks made on the Ramayan and its characters but never before has there been a full fledged animation movie around the story. The highlight of the movie is that it is India's first ever animated movie based on Hanuman's life and takes the viewer through Hanuman's birth till the great victory over Lanka. The movie talks about number of extraordinary feats that he displayed since his childhood through 100 minutes of world class animation. The movie boasts of 40 characters and 200,000 individual images that resulted in the movie Hanuman, which is directed by V.G.Samant and has Mukesh Khanna providing the voice-over for Hanuman."
