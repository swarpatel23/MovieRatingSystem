" the loadest taal(beat) in ghais career","a fresh feel, a fresh look, a fresh conceptTaal is a great movie. Great story, great performances, great songs and great look & feel. It should be the utopia of modern Indian cinema and it should represent what all movies should aspire to be like. This can be classed as one of the best, if not the best movie ever made by Subhash Ghai.
The cast is great, including the supporting cast. The star of the show is Ashwaria, whose portrayal of a simple village girl coming to terms with love, hurt and pressures of modern life is excellent. It was probably the role that helped her to shed her Barbie doll image and her acting was very natural, full of character and spot on. It was good to see the transformation from the first half where she is the small town girl, to the second half where she is a reputable icon. Akshaye was great in his role as Manav, a determined, strong headed, love bitten guy. Akshaye always gives sound performances and never lets you down as in this case. Anil Kapoor is fab in this role. His comedic side always hit the right note (best part being the rules of life!!). Alok Nath & Amrish Puri gave good performances and really do support the movie. The story is simple, to the point and not extra bits added in. Manav sees Mansi and is smitten by her and slowly she develops feelings for him (through some fab songs like Taal and Ishq Bina) and then he goes back to the big city. She follows him and is cast aside by his family. Becoming more determined she pursues a sing job, becomes really good. Her career is helped by Vikrant who also has feelings for her and proposes to her.  The climax helps to bring things together. If one was to think of something bad to say about Taal, then they will be thinking for a long, long time." 
" Good for apparent reasons","The plot of this film is the usual bollywood fare, poor girl, rich boy, disapproving family. The acting and the script are the usual yada yada. So what makes this movie incredible? It is A MIND BLOWING AUDIO/VISUAL TREAT! At the end of the movie, I was frozen! I could only exhale a modest "WOW". Someone pulled out all the stops for choreography, costuming, scene dressing and location! Your eyes and ears will thank you! The overwhelming beauty of this film together with the fantastic rendering of songs makes you want to get up and dance. Scene after scene make you want to gasp. I highly recommend it. Only Aishwarya Rai could have done this, her eternal beauty with the backdrop of India are the show stoppers. Must see!" 
" One of the finest movies Made till Date ! Simple yet so grand :)","I remember watching taal when i was kid , And Aishwarya Rai was everywhere owin to her two hit Movies - Hum dil de chuke sanam and Taal .Taal Is all in all a Pure musical !! Its a journey of a girl With Music Playin a Important role in the backdrop hence the name Taal.The movie starts with AISHWARYA Rai (Mansi) a beautiful small town girl with great voice who meets AKSHAYE KHANA (Manav) a Rich down to earth guy . Now the same old Status problem arises and Mansi and Manav's Parents are logger heads and have a heated Fight which results the Couple SplttinG . Mansi Is approached to be a lead singer by A Leading music Composer ANIL KAPOOR (Vikrant) who also owns a Music company . Mansi becomes a overnight star , Manav Tries convincing Mansi all this time to come back to her . Now Vikrant proposes Mansi and Mansi agrees to marry him But Somewhere down her heart even she knows she loves Manav and isn't over him . Now What does Manasi Do ?? Will She Marry Vikrant and Kill her love for MANAV OR Will she Get back to Manav is the basic plot of the movie ? This movie has been made amazingly well it is possibly Subash Ghai's Best Work . The music by A.R REHMAN is the best part of the Movie . Aishwarya Steals the show completely its her movie all the way , Akshay khanna is great Too , Anil kapoor is funny and goofy and plays his part exceedingly well.Taal is a simple story which looks so pure on the screen and even the cinematography Is not over the top grand its just about perfect .A must watch for People who think Bollywood is all about stupid Dance - Around - The - Three Flick ." 
" One of the most romantic movie of the decade","This is one of my the most favorite Hindi movies and I had seen this masterpiece over 10-15 times.The main cause of that, even before the movie itself is,Aishwarya Rai.Before the movie released I saw Aish in couple of movies like-Aa Ab Laut Chalen and Aur Pyar Ho Gaya...but I have to admit,i was disappointed with her acting and the roles she played.To my opinion that time she was all beauty no talent.But all of my opinions and likes/dislikes about her changes upside down after I saw this movie-I was stunned!She gave a groundbreaking performance which easily topped over last few years' almost every performance.She looked SO Beautiful and Wonderful and Glamorous and....I have no words for that!She blend her character Mansi so well that I had hard times to remind me that this is only a movie character,not a real person.Her acting was simply natural,as though she had acted like this for years.I was very sad when she didn't get the filmfare award for Taal the next year(though she got the award for another film 'Hum De Chuke Sanam' that year from two nominations).This film was a total turnaround for her career.Besides Aishwarya,Anil Kapoor was also simply brilliant with his arrogant and egoistic character and delivered a knockout performance(he won the best supporting actor filmfare award for this film). Akshaye Khanna also gave a good performance,though I think he is been batter in his later movies like Humraaz,Deewangee,Dil ChahtaHai ...I wish he worked out his hairstyle in this film,his hair looked horrible.About the direction,the cinematography,the music,the choreography,the editing all are simply perfect...too perfect.The director is none other than Subhash Ghai,that name speaks all.The best thing about this movie(besides the acting)is it's award winning cinematography.The parts in village (including the rain song and wedding song)are fabulous!The music direction was given by the maestro A.R. Rahman and the lyrics were written by the living legend Javed Akhter(both won filmfare in their categories),together they made some unforgettable tune and songs that will lasted forever.Oh, and also about the choreography...which name would you think can only match with these two?Saroj Khan.So,this is in my opinion, one of the most romantic movies of the decade and it is perfect from all angles...technical or acting.I recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a truly beautiful emotional romantic movie. 10/10" 
" A musical treaty to Hindi Speakers.","I just watched the movie, after 11 years of its release; got totally involved in the movie. It was stunning, especially considering the fact that I already knew the story. Although any bollywood fan can predict the story, but interesting part is its execution, its flow. One thing that may disappoint you is one of the metaphor used for love(sharing cold drink). I am not a great fan of love at first sight, but in this case simplicity of characters and naturalism of dialogues/thoughts will force you to digest that. Apart from being wonderfully musical it seems to me the most romantic movie of the decade, rich in family values, close to reality in many aspects. I would say it is must watch for any romantic musical person. I am gonna buy the DVD as soon as my pocket allows me." 
" Musical treat","One of the better films i have seen.And definitely one of the better by Subaash Ghai.Though having seen Saudagar and Pardes surely Ghai has a lot of better efforts .Truly not as good as Pardes.Story is same old and the screenplay is utterly predictable.Story is just the typical old triangle boy meets girl falls in love and sons dump of girl falls in love with another guy and guy 1 returns.Climax brings every thing.The movie is not that excellent but still a well made movieThis movie is enjoyable mainly because of the songs.Songs are excellent.The best songs are Kahin Aag Laage and Ramta Jogi.And the performances are excellent.Aishwarya shines in the role of Mansi and is so easy on the eyes in the emotional and dramatic scenes unlike ones like Sushmitha.Who also happens to be a fine actress.Her dancing is amazing.Akshaye was also good.Though this is the only performance that i liked of his.Anil Kapoor superbly stands out and gives a knock out performance.Overall a simple and yet a very entertaining film" 
" Stunning...","What a breath-taking movie.  I loved it from start to finish.  I was initially not a very big Aishwayra Rai fan, but after her performance, i have begun to re-evaluate that thought. She was excellent.  The rest of the cast was good too.  Akshaye Khanna was good in his role, perhaps lacking a bit of conviction, but a more than decent performance.So the plot?  Rich Boy see's poor girl, falls instantly in love, and the uphill battle ensue's for love to prevail.  Nothing groundbreaking, but the cinematography was brilliant, and the soundtrack is wqually beautiful, if not better.  A must see!" 
" Great Experience","You haven't lived till you've seen Taal :-) This one is a top classical no nonsense hindi movie.  For all fans of Aishwarya this is a must but also for people who like a good movie w/o the usual tragic/poverty scenes.I really like the movie and the music is awesome!" 
" Hopeless Bollywood Melodrama","If the movie had finished 40 minutes earlier, I would give a rating of 9 for its stunning music & lyrics, original presentation and the brilliant performance of Anil Kapoor. Aishwarya also exhibited her decent (and evolving) acting talent as well as graceful dancing skills. Alas, all these attributes are ruthlessly ruined by the true-Indian-girl-goes-back-to-her-first-love stereotype. Should the storyline tilt audience's mood from one extreme of love to the other extreme of hate? What an arrogant, despicable cliche! The script writers are doomed for wasting great talents of veteran actors and the shinning beauty in the eyes of Aishwarya Rai.Rating 2 of 10, 1 for the music and 1 for Anil Kapoor." 
" Good movie with memorable music.","I am a big fan of the work of Mr Subhash Ghai,a very talented director who makes meaningful films with wonderful music time after time. The story is nothing too complicated, but the film is almost flawless technically. The cinematography is great as is the screenplay. Akshaye's role wasn't for him; someone like Salman Khan or SRK could've made it a great movie. Still a good effort by Akshaye. Anil Kapoor is superb; his performance is great. I never thought Aishwariya had it in her, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this film. Amrish Puri and Alok Nath are also good. The unique selling points of this movie are: the music, screenplay, cinematography and acting by Ash and Anil. Speaking of music, the music of this film is great; the lyrics by Anand Bakshi are really good.Verdict: you don't want to miss this one. I give it 8/10." 
" Good Music and Good-looking girl","Early in the film, Akshaye Khanna is shown basically stalking Aishwaria Rai and secretly taking photos of her while she's bathing and undressing, and then hangs all the photos on his wall and sits there and looks at them. So I thought this movie was going to be a "psycho-stalking" movie. But then my wife explained to me that in Indian movies, the standard way of developing a romantic story is to show the man stalking the woman and obsessing over her in a fashion which might, in other cultures, be considered criminal behavior. Armed with this new found knowledge, I was able to enjoy the movie. The music of A.R. Rahman, who appears to carry the burden of creating the music for every one of the 400 movies to come out of Bombay every year, is catchy and the stars look good." 
" A delight to the senses.","In short, the story is not unique nor very clever.  However, the cinematography is fabulous. In particular, the opening scenes highlight Subhash Ghai's talented team.  The music of A.R. Rahman with lyrics by legendary Anand Bakshi is the best I have heard in the last 5 years.The acting is clearly lacking. Akshaye Khanna at times makes funny facial expressions (he's no Jim Carry).  Aishwarya Rai's acting is at par but nothing spectacular.  Anil Kapoor clearly takes the ball and runs with it. He has the best dialogue and most emotions.  Amrish Puri again plays his usual stern self.Overall, the cinematography, music and lyrics overshadow the acting and it delights the senses.  Highly recommended for pure entertainment value." 
" the best bollywood movie i have ever watched","its been a long time since i saw this movie , you can say i was a kid then and so far i have seen this movie so many times which i haven't even counted , every time i watch this movie i just say "wow" ..every aspect of the movie is great though there are some minor drawbacks which are always there in bollywood movies but i won't count any of them in this case . music of the movie is just great as its been almost 10 years but i still like them and .. one thing i noted in the choreography was that , it would have been better if ghai would have hired some professional orchestra people to train anil kapoor as it feels odd at times if you disagree to what i have said then care to name a better musical love story then this one @ kashif99048@msn.comhope you people like my tiny review" 
" Never a dull moment","My first introduction to a Hindi movie in the cinema and it certainly won't be my last. This film is lush in its use of colour, music, location and good acting. The cinematography is breathtaking in many areas not least being a wonderful tracking/crane shot over treetops apparently made without the use of a helicopter(the leaves are perfectly still). The story is predictable but welcome and the musical segments hold your attention like a vice. The use of Dolby surround is perfect and the actors make leaving your seat impossible. Even if you don't speak Hindi (as I don't) this movie is well worth the price of admission." 
" Good music in cliched but watchable film","Rating6/10Good music by A R Rehman in Bollywood love triangle. Khanna is ok while Kapoor overacts. Film is long with cliched plot but quite watchable" 
" Good movie","Taal movie was a 1999 Bollywood musical romantic movie directed by Subhash Ghai.The film stars Anil Kapoor, Akshaye Khanna, Aishwarya Rai, Amrish Puri and Alok Nath.This movie shows the effects of true love. The theme of the movie is very attractive. Aishwarya rai did very well. The comedy scenes were good. Mid part of the movie was something average. Some sets are just amazing.end part of the movie creates suspense according to the views.Moreover, the song 'hum dil de chuke sanam' is fantastic song. The soundtrack of the film was composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics written by Anand Bakshi.Finally i rated this movie with 5 stars."
