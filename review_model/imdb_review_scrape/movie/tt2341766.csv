" A Beautiful Combination of Comedy, Romance and Drama","Nautanki Saala! was a thoroughly enjoyable movie, from beginning to end. The first half is hilarious and the audience was laughing uncontrollably. The second half becomes a little more serious, but the story of the three main characters is artfully interwoven throughout. The dialog is witty and the acting was superb -- I was particularly impressed with the lead actor, Ayushmann Khurrana, whose range of expression and detail to the nuances of his character was on full display. Kunaal Roy Kapur was lovable and is comical with his goofy, aloof look. Finally, Pooja Salvi starts a little slow but grows into her role progressively and delivers a powerful flourish at the end.In short: watch the movie, you will not be disappointed. You will identify with the characters, you will laugh at their banter, and you will appreciate the creativity and imagination of the storyline.P.S. This is the kind of movie you would want to watch with your partner or your friends, since some of the "romantic" scenes are not conducive to parent-child watching." 
" If, it's clean, intelligent fun that you are looking for, then 'Nautanki Saala!' is where you need to be headed.","An official remake of the French film APRES VOUS 2003, NAUTANKI SAALA! is *not* another slapstick comedy that uses every trick in the book to make you laugh. On the contrary, the humor here is tailored for spectators who love new-age cinema. Rohan steps into a new terrain with NAUTANKI SAALA!, but the plot as well as the situations are so unfussy and uncomplicated and the characters so convincing and timid too! that you start taking to the goings-on without much struggle. On the whole, NAUTANKI SAALA! is uncontaminated, witty and amusing, offers an interesting premise with plenty of good laughs. A lightweight fare that caters to filmmakers with an appetite for contemporary cinema, this movie ought to be on your 'to watch' list for sure!Evidently, reiterating our faith that good humor does not necessarily translate into shameful buffoonery. Rohan layers it with side-splitting comedy, some great lines and incredible performances. It's no 'Delhi Belly' or 'Vicky Donor', yet it holds its own with some striking performers and wickedly clever humor If, it's clean, intelligent fun that you are looking for, then 'Nautanki Saala!' is where you need to be headed." 
" The Sensible Comedy Movies are back...","NAUTANKI SAALA is a romantic-comedy film starring Ayushmann Khurrana, Kunal Roy Kapur, Pooja Salvi and Gaelyn Mendonca. It is directed by Rohan Sippy and produced by Rohit Sippy.The film revolves around the life of Ram Parmar (Ayushmann Khurrana), preferably called RP. He is an actor who works in a Ramayana play called Raavan, directed by him. One day after his show, he's on his way home where he comes across Mandar Lele (Kunal Roy Kapur) committing suicide in the middle of the road by hanging himself. In a quick heroic act, RP manages to save him, and comes to realize that Mandar is a very depressed person and feels that he's a burden to God and on Earth. He's a very pessimistic person. He also finds out that Mandar is depressed due to a recent break-up with a girl named Nandini (Pooja Salvi) who he loves very much. Feeling sorry for Mandar, RP decides to help him out, thus beginning a huge friendship between the two.Okay, so when I saw the trailer for this movie, I couldn't make out whether it was a good movie or not. The only thing that caught my attention was Ayushmann Khurrana who had recently become one of my favorite actors after Vicky Donor. It was surprising to see Kunal Roy Kapur in a serious role after Delhi Belly. But anyways, apart from the two of them, I didn't know what the movie had in store for me. Finally, I decided to see it, only to see what it contained and I was pretty sure that Ayushmann would justify his role and the movie would be pretty watchable. At the end of the movie, I can say Nautanki Saala was pretty much what I expected- a rom-com film with a couple of laughs here and there, some mushy romantic stuff and some song and you've got your movie. Now from what I just said you'd probably think this was movie was really bad, although it actually wasn't. I really liked some of the jokes. It did it's best not to be slapstick but to make sense. And the songs weren't much. Whatever was added to the movie from the soundtrack was cut to be made as short as possible. The only problem was the ending, which was SOOO clich√©d, but the film put the same point through in an indirect way; a different way from the other rom-coms.Performance-wise, even though Ayushmann Khurrana is our big star here, I would have to give the trophy to Kunal Roy Kapur. Don't get me wrong over here, Ayushmann is one of my favorite Bollywood actors and his acting was really great, but somehow I felt Kunal Roy Kapur's role was more sophisticated, and while you would think that an actor who played a constipated guy's role in his first break-through film, it would be impossible to see him play a depressed guy coping with his life's destiny. He played his role so well. The way he expressed his comedy, his emotions... it was really great. Pooja Salvi did a pretty decent job. Not the BEST I would say but it's pretty decent. Gaelyn Mendonca's acting was just background. It was unnecessary but just had to be there due to the plot.The replay value is a few times, but its not extraordinary so you are bound to get sick of it at some time.I wouldn't give this movie a 6 or a 7 but it's somewhat in between. Nautanki Saala is a 6.5/10 rating for me.I think that this movie proves that 'The Sensible Comedy Movies' are back. For the past couple of months we have been experiencing a couple of wacky, slapstick movies that are humorous yet mindless. Nautanki Saala proves that a movie doesn't need to have a bad story and a bunch of meaningless jokes for the audience to laugh. Nautanki Saala manages to achieve a good story line, jokes related to the matter and which actually make sense. With films like Jolly LLB and Nautanki Saala, lets just hope with get more like these and maybe an occasional Chashme Baddoor and a Mere Dad Ki Maruti but definitely not a Himmatwala." 
" The movie is a romantic comedy which stands among those feel good movies which are made for a pleasant two hour time-pass.","Nautanki Saala hits bang on to accomplish its target - "To Entertain". Its a light hearted comedy-drama movie which deserves a watch. Director Rohan Sippy has created this movie with a lot of puns right from the movie-name he chose : not only the word "Nautanki" means drama but also the movie is based on a drama-artist (Ayushmann Khurana) who tries to create a real-life drama in order to help his friend ! There are some adorable pun scenes like the angry girlfriend displayed with steam coming out of her ears which actually is a steaming cooker in the background.The film starts with RP (played by Ayushmann Khurana) meeting up with Mandar Lele( played by Kunal Roy Kapur) who is trying to commit suicide after having a break-up with her girlfriend Nandini Patel( played by Pooja Salvi). RP saves Mandar and against all odds and tries to set Mandar's life back in track by getting him a job at his play and finding Nandini for him. But then, its just a matter of time when the wingman finds himself becoming a pursuant. The all-famous Bollywood drama of Love Triangles reappears. Though the story is not an unpredictable or an original one (being inspired from french movie "After You"), it does succeed in creating unpredictable comic events. The film duration has been set to two hours which is apt for a simple plot like this one and the movie successfully engages you. Additionally, the movie has some great songs which makes it a pleasant watch. Ayushmann Khurana has performed exceptionally well but Pooja Salve might have been better. The movie has already raked up around 13 crores in the opening weekend and is poised to be a hit or at least a semi-hit.Do watch this one if you are looking for a two-hour time pass !!" 
" A helpful man gets entangled in a love affair risking his career, friendship and girlfriend.","Very very surprised by the poor reviews. Just goes to show that subtlety is much too undervalued these days. Just LOVED this film. A comedy that doesn't depend on slapstick/ fart jokes and the likes.Sure, the story is quite predictable, but its the smaller things that make the film stand out... the sign board on Mandar's gate, Mandar greeting King Janak in the drama with a 'HI'& Janak responding and realizing his folly and trying to correct, RP refusing to support Loli's claim that things happen between men & women, RP's justification by using the 'profile' test, and many many more.Performances are all above average but its the use of music in this film that shines through. The songs don't feel forced and take the story forward.The support cast including Sanjeev bhatt as Chandra and Sulabha Arya as Aaji were fantastic. All in all a complete entertainer that left me wanting for more." 
" Complex comedy with complex emotions","Score 7/10 Director Mr. Rohan Sippy has done good work. He has taken the script one level ahead by adding very fine nuances through visuals. Story is linear but screenplay gives it new dimensions. Screenplay is full of metaphors. Screenplay has some minus points also, i.e., a person dedicated to theater, why did he force and manipulate to cast a duffer, who could have ruined the show. After all considering the merits such type of minuses should be ignored. Dialogues are very good. Writing credit goes to Rohan Sippy, Nipun Dharmadhikari and Charudutt Acharya. Love and comedy are blended very well so you can feel the both emotions in maximum number of scenes. Climax is light and good. Performance wise Ayushman Khuran as Ram Parmar is impressive. Kunal Roy Kapoor as Mandar Leleis fine. Pooja Salvi as Nandini is good. Gaelyn Mendonca as Chitra is OK. An actor who played the character of producer of drama company is very good. Music by Mikey Mccleary supports the film well.Especially love tracks are soothing." 
" very well executed comedy","this movie was really entertaining,and the comedy was quiet good. the characters are very lively and they connect well with the audience. it starts with ram parmar going to a doctor for his worsening mental condition, he tells the doctor that he has had three breakups in three months. the whole story is about his three breakups,which are linked together very beautifully in a story. the comedy in this film is very natural.the actors do not try to forcefully make you laugh but it is the situation which compels you to laugh. i will really recommend this film. it is comical,entertaining and very well written and executed,which is very rare in Bollywood." 
" DON'T go for it!","We are not meant to appreciate the acting and understand the intricacies of a highly acclaimed movie.Movie is about having spent sometime of your life in someone else's shoes and enjoying it there. The most important part of a movie is keeping you interest which this movie CANNOT!To say I didn't laugh would be wrong. I did, few times but dude! It was predictable. In five minutes, anyone could tell you the whole plot including the stupid ass jokes. :|I was so bored I WALKED OUT. I for once don't like seeing a dime go to waste. Hell, I sat through unimaginably excruciating movies like Tom, Dick and Harry. Still, this went unbearable.Ayushman is a good actor, but this movie is so boring that even he looks like a buffoon.Please, DON'T go.PS: I can't tell you about the second half but, then you probably won't need to know." 
" Bollywood, Why Do You Do This To Me?","With lots of newness comes a film that rarely moves out of the box. Derived from his father's epic action movie, Nautanki Saala! is a very poor entertainer by Rohan Sippy.Ayushmann Khurrana is surprisingly parallel with his role as a lover-boy from Vicky Donor, only that here the situations are different. He works so hard to keep up with his antics, but the film's blueprint just rejects his help. Kunal Roy Kapur is annoying in the first half and towards the end, his ambiguous character touches puberty only to be "so mature & moved-on." Not just him, almost all the characters have equivocal stances related to them with newcomer Pooja Salvi still thinking she is acting in a TV commercial. Evelyn Sharma compensates for the lack of item-number here. But the song "Life Ki Toh Lat Lagi" is kinda cool.There is no story, but the plot driven out of it is what makes me rate it 3.5/10. Music is cheerful & so is the screenplay with its own share of some nice dialogs (Marathi ones), punch lines & slapstick. That's all.With the lead female characters used as love-toys, Pooja Salvi works in a flower shop which entertains only 2 customers, Ayushmann's character wanders here and there. The movie reminds us it is 2013 but fails, abruptly to make it look like it is. Very poor attempt & I hear it is a remake. God! Why?BOTTOM LINE: The second half is the most ennui-ridden, but if you are fan of any of the factors of this movie, I would recommend you to go for it only for the first part. One ambiguous, uninteresting movie this! And I hear Commando (another release this week) is hopeless.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? MAYBELanguage: Strong | Sex: No, Implied | Nudity: Mediocre | Mouth-Kiss: Strong | Foreplay: Mild | Violence: Mediocre | Gore: No | Traumatizing Factor: No" 
" A Decent Comedy!","Inspired from the French Film "Apres Vous", 'Nautanki Saala!' Directed by Rohan Sippy, is A Decent Comedy, that has its share of rib-tickling moments working for it. Even the performances are pretty good.'Nautanki Saala!' Synopsis: An actor's life changes dramatically when he saves a stranger from suicide.'Nautanki Saala!' is not a slapstick comedy, its a situational comedy. The first-hour progresses well, as most of the jokes & sequences work. The second-hour, on the other-hand, is stretched & slightly boring. The Adapted Screenplay has its share of pluses & minuses. Rohan Sippy is technically sound. He knows his job well. Cinematography is lavish. Editing is crisp. Music by various artists, is hummable. Performance-Wise: Ayushmann Khurrana & Kunaal Roy Kapur share a fabulous on-screen chemistry. They both are wonderful in their respective parts. Pooja Salvi needs proper grooming. Gaelyn Mendonca is excellent. Abhishek Bachchan has a funny cameo. On the whole, 'Nautanki Saala!' offers humor." 
" Nautanki","A deep love and powerful comedy movie
Must and watch movie" 
" amazingly fresh in time of Himmatwala and remake of Chasme Buddoor","this movie directed by ROHAN SIPPY is a remake of a french film and yeah credit has been given to original film. story is about a MR NICE GUY ram par mar or RP played by Ayushman Khurana who is always helping everyone getting in all trouble after he saves someone from suicide. lead role is played by Ayushman Khurana who looked very promising in Vicky donor. he does not disappoint here. well if you are cynic you may find similarity in both roles of Vicky donor and Nanking Sal.he is the director of super hit play ravanleela and he is also working as ravan. kunal Roy kapoor plays depressive person role who has no reason to live because his love of life played by pooja salve has left him. he is very convincing and very effortless in comic scenes. there are three ladies in this movie. Evelyn sharma does well in a short role she has. but Pooja is a disappointment because she had great scope of being a clueless girl who does not know which guy to love. she acts like she is still working for commercials. one of the surprise package is producer of the play, he is really funny. there are those small characters which add flavor to film like the Malayalam woman in hospital who requires a person to explain what she said. plot: once RP going back to his place from play finds a guy trying to suicide, he helps him and gives him shelter and literally adopts him. he feels without anything good to do he Kunaal Roy Kapoor has no purpose in life so he gives him role of ram in his play. and the comedy begins. if you are expecting comedy in David Dhavan style you may be disappointed. after sometime RP comes to know that Mandar is unhappy because his love of life has left him so he tries to get both of them back but he falls in love with Mandar's love. now he starts feeling guilty and doesn't know what to do. talking about technical things, cinematography is absolute treat. we see a different Mumbai in this movie that we don't see in other movies. scene of play are well taken. music is beautiful and well used in situation, both original song and songs from old movies work well. Ayushman Khurana sings another magical song sadi gali in this movie. fresh approach to movie distinguish movie from slapstick masala movies, a movie which should not missed for its innocent and honest effort. only thing i thought was a letdown was when RP is feeling guilty. he is playing ravan in the play but he tried to be ram in life. this thing could have been used more to show his confusion. and well yeah my prediction is this movie might get little profit in box office. and it will be a cult favorite in some years." 
" bollywood teaser!!","not many words are needed to rate this movie,once u visit the cinema hall u will find urself crying only these words"wat a lol i am" or maybe "@#!$ me",,,,, i think director slept while movie was being shot or they have started fixing in bollywood too,well who knows?????? ayushman failed to cash on much hard fought hype of his previous stint,all other characters were there for just sake of being... music__yeah one or two songs might ring in ur ears but again they cannot compensate for poor acting,no story,poor casting and in fact this movie must have been released on 1st april i think. In such comptetive world how diligently Rohan Sippy must have worked to rot the movie...." 
" A cool timepass film","I hardly expected much from the film, the promos didn't look too appealing though the songs were a hit The film is a surprise, based on a french film Apres Vous After Dumb Maaro Dum(2011), Rohan Sippy does a comeback to films and he gives us an endearing film The film starts off well, the scenes between Ayushman and Kunal are superb and there are several witty one liners that make you smile However the speedbreakers come in the form of the half baked love story between Mandar and his ex which is never explored much, Nandini's character too isn't well explained as she keeps moving from one lover to another. The film also gets prolonged towards the last half and hour and finally ends well The film keeps you entertained due to the way the director handles the situations and the twist and turnsDirection is good, and he has come a long way Music is good, Saadi Gali and Mera Mann are the best The usage of old song So Gaya is superb, Dhak Dhak however is tampered badlyAyushman after a superb Vicky Donor does a superb comeback, he is a natural and slips into the role effortlessly Kunal Roy Kapoor takes you by surprise after winning everyone's heart in Delhi Belly(2011) he is simply outstanding Pooja Salvi is given a half baked role and she hardly impresses barring her beauty Evelyn Sharma is given a short role and is okay, Gayle Mendonca is superb as Chitra though her role could be better Rufy Khan is okay, Sulbha Arya is fantastic Abhishek Bachchan who is a common identity in all RS films does a cameo Sanjeev Bhatt is terrific" 
" Surprisingly Amazing film","I saw Nautanki Saala around 6 years back and I liked it then, so much so that I saw it again today when I personally believe I have a much better capability to appreciate a well made film.The movie is far from perfect, but attains its targets by being a really different romantic comedy buffed up by amazing performances by all the actors involved. Apart from a bit irritating characters like the producer of the theater and the girlfriend of Ayushmann, the movie holds pretty good over the audience.The sad part really is that such movies are often box office failures, despite being much more reality driven compared to some blockbuster flicks." 
" Romantic Comedy","Halki fulki Comedy scenes and dialogues. Authentic Screenplay. Kunal roy kapoor did awesome job."
