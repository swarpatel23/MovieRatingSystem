" Nice Film with a heart!","Thank god for a simple and sweet movie. Not trying to preach you anything big, not having a huge moral, or a huge budget, or super stars trying to look super cool, thank god for all that. The first thing you'd notice about Aao Wish Karien is, that it is an amazingly sweet movie, which makes you laugh and cry and certain points, and I can't wait to say this, I think Aftab has arrived. The performance of Aaftab was so nuanced and well balanced, a grown up with a heart and mind of kid, it reminded me of Hrithik's performance in Krish, only there was no over the top ham acting. Story is, in one line, a kid who wishes to grow up because the girl he loves thinks he is a kid, actually grows up the next day. Like all the good movies, I didn't think it was long, I didn't go out during the songs, I laughed at the right moments (others laughed as well) and was holding back a tear at the right moment as well (others did as well). Now only thing I want is all my friends to watch this movie, and support his kind of cinema, it is good and refreshing. Please don't pay 100/200 bucks to movies like Blue, just to watch someone's biceps and someone else's cleavage, watch a movie made by heart and care, and not by slick editing, and oodles of money thrown in. Heart warming, indeed." 
" Must Watch!!","Well we start with the performance.. Mr.Aftab act superb!! he was amazing and his friend was awesome too the kids were also awesome all the other cast was superb now the story it is a modern fairly tale (story adopted from movie Big) in which a kid loves a girl the problem is he is only 12 years old and the girl is 22 or 21 something everyone call him kid because he is a kid but he think he is a big elder man he wants to became a man Mr Hitchcock a modern fairy mother show him a wishing well he drops a coin in the well and poof.. the main story is that what happen next?? watch it out for yourself it is a family must a must watch!!!" 
" Aloo Chaat Worked, But This One FAILED!","Till this day I am eagerly waiting for Aftab to Bring another movie like KASOOR or FOOTHPATH. He acted superbly in KASOOR, but now he seems to be getting worse at his acting as he keeps making more. I really really want to like him and his movies but when he keeps doing flops like this one, it gets really hard to like him and his acting.How can you even come close to act like Tom Hanks from the movie "Big"? Yes this whole movie was the copy of Hollywood Movie Big, actually this turned even worse as the story went on because Aftab was overacting soooo much. He should've studied Tom Hanks thoroughly. He also acted in that Ridiculous copy of "Death at a Funeral" in Daddy Cool, and overdid his character so much compared to UK version.The only good thing about this movie was Aamna Shariff, she is very pretty and is a very decent actor. That's why Aloo Chaat worked. Aloo Chaat's storyline was great and her acting was superb in it. In this one she kept trying her best but the storyline lacked soo much that it seemed as if she had to struggle.And Honestly HOW CAN U CHOOSE A COMEDY LEGEND JOHNNY LEVER for the most ridiculous character ever. Even he's loosing his respect for himself and his career for taking such stupid roles. Honestly this movie is not worth wasting your time, if you want to see a better Aftab and Aamna Shariff decent movie then just watch Aloo chaat instead!" 
" This is a bad movie","Aao Wish Karein, inspired from the Tom Hanks-starrer Big, is the kind of film its misguided makers seem convinced kids will enjoy. Good luck with that, considering it's a painfully predictable, sickeningly romantic, unfunny film that talks down to kids as if they're stupid little creatures who don't deserve anything smarter. Anguished on discovering he's adopted, hurt by his father's indifference, and heartbroken that he can't hook up with the woman of his dreams, 12-year-old Mickey wishes that he were older. Lo and behold, the next morning he wakes up to find his dream has come true. Mickey (now played by Aftab Shivdasani) runs away from home, gets a job inventing children's computer games, and woos local ballet teacher Mithika (played by Aamna Sharif) who gradually reciprocates his feelings, even though he's basically a bumbling fool. By concentrating mostly on the love story between Mithika and Mickey, the film's makers pass up the opportunity to treat this as a light-hearted comedy, and deliver the kind of innocent gags this plot was ripe for. When they do give you comedy, it's of the kind that doesn't belong in a children's film. Like the scene in which Mickey encounters a prostitute who he invites home unsuspectingly, then dodges her advances when she's there. Or then you get an over-the-top Tiku Talsania who screams and shouts and bellows maniacally as Mickey's mad-hatter boss. And Johnny Lever in an embarrassing costume and matching wig as Hitchcock, the modern-day fairy godmother who grants Mickey his wish. The film comes down like a house of cards because it doesn't get its basic principles right. It's a kid's film with barely any fun. Alternating between sappy romance and sentimental fluff, the film offers nothing in terms of unbridled excitement.Much of the blame for the film's failure rests with its principal star Aftab Shivdasani who plays Mickey as a crackpot of sorts instead of investing in him an irresistible child-like innocence. His co-star Aamna Sharif forever looks like she's walked out of the fashion pages of a women's magazine, but doesn't contribute much in the acting department. Far from achieving the fairytale feel it was going for, Aao Wish Karein is a colossally boring film that packs clunky dialogue, a predictable narrative and a muddled message in the end. Barring a few superb songs, this film is a miscalculation on all counts.To be honest, I've seen fifth standard students put up school-plays more entertaining than this!" 
" Big Bollywood Style.","This was a really poor adaptation of the Tom Hanks Blockbuster 'Big' it was so melodramatic and over-the-top that I felt like I was watching a soap-opera. The little kid who plays Mickey was a little too rude for my liking but I guess most kids are like that at that age. And it did not help any that they dressed Johnny Lever up like a cross between Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow and Amitabh Bachchan from 'Jhoom Barabar Jhoom'. It looked like it was shot on the same set as the Amitabh Bachchan starrer 'Aladin', the songs were cute but annoying, the girl who plays the love interest was just required too look pretty and nothing else, it's clear that somebody sure had a little too much fun making this film. Only watch this if you're a fan of one or more of the talent within the film. Aftab is always good in whatever he acts in but this is one script I wish he would have passed on. All of that and the fact that this movie was a tad-bit too long."
