" Extremely funny and emotional","The first half was so funny that I had a sore stomach and there wasn't a single scene were I didn't laugh. The film shows the problems of people who are in dept it is a serious matter but was shown with extreme humour. Paresh Rawal & Rajpal Yadav were the best, the movie would be completely nothing without them because both of them are terrific comic actors. In the first appearance of Paresh he tried to hide himself from someone because he took a loan from him and he was putting his face on the ground just like an ostrich hiding it's head in a hole that is why the film is called Chup Chup Ke because everyone is hiding from someone else. Cinematography was excellent and everyone was wearing white clothing I don't know why probably to highlight everyone but it did look good on them. The second half was really emotional and I felt really sorry for both girls who wanted to marry Shahid Kapoor and the ending was good because everyone were fair to each other. The movie was directed by Priyadarshan who is the best comedy director after David Dhawan and Chup Chup Ke is his best film as far as I've seen them. Songs are amazing made by one of my favourite music composers Himesh Reshammiya the best songs are Shabe Firaq and Dil Vich Lagya." 
" Yadav takes the bakery","A light family entertainer which contains many good laughs. The real star of Chup Chup Ke is Rajpal Yadav. He makes one choke with laughter. Surprisingly full mileage is not taken out of the roles of Paresh Rawal and Om Puri. Kareena looks stunning , ravishing and lot of ...ings and her chemistry with Shahid works for the movie. Now a few bad points. Shahid carries his role single dimensionally. Chup Chup Ke is a movie in which many people are surplus to the requirement. Neha Dhupia is wasted and so are Anupam Kher, Sushma Reddy, Om Puri and Paresh Rawal. Asrani and Shakti Kapoor are just a shadows of their former selves. Sunil Shetty looks tired and type casted. But the biggest let down is casting of Om Puri as a Gujju. Sushma Reddy looks unpalatable sans make up." 
" Ssshhhhh........","I saw the movie at least 5-6 times in TV. But every time I missed some crucial portion so I could understand the movie. But then during holi of 2007 I got a chance to watch the movie when it was being shown in local cable channel in Patna. This is a typical original Priyadarshan movie.Shahid Kapoor takes a lot of loans from different peoples in order to settle in some business. He is unable to repay the loan. To escape from the lenders he jumps to the village river to commit suicide. But he is saved by Paresh Rawal and Rajpal Yadav who own a boat & are fisherman by profession. Paresh Rawan has taken a huge loan from Om Puri to procure the boat and he is also unable to repay it. Hence he leaves both Shahid & Rajpal in their home as a security. Shahid pretends to be deaf & mute and obviously won their sympathy. Kareena falls for Shahid thinking that he is actually deaf & mute. Confusion starts when Sushma Reddy comes into the picture. She is the ex-fiancée of Shahid and stays as his widow thinking him to be dead.Whom will Shahid marry finally. Will it be Kareena or Sushma ? Chup Chup Ke though is a comedy but it is in different class than that of certain Dhawan. Priyan's Garam Masala, Hulchul, Hungama, Yeh tera ghar yeh mera ghar, Hera Pheri, Phir Herapheri, Muskurahat were of different class. His comedy are of different league altogether than those of all other comedy movies.In all, Chup Chup ke makes a nice watch." 
" the funniest movie i have ever seen! best ever!","I have seen plenty of the Indian movies, almost all of them are about young men and women trying to get married. This one is a little similar, however, this film is so very funny. I had to rewind some scenes just to laugh again. I have never seen a film that made me to laugh so hard.Best of all, those funny scenes don't seem to be contrived. they are so natural. The actors are so good at it. Rajpal Yadav was the best. Indian movies tend to be more than two hours long with an interval. Most of the films lost its momentum in the first part. I very much enjoyed this film, I actually didn't mind that this film was so long, because they keep showing funny scenes one after another.If you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely watch it. It will make you laugh so hard. Too bad, the storyline is mostly fit with the Indian society. Otherwise, I totally hope that Hollywood can make one based on this.Shahid Kapur, he can really dance. there was one close up scene showing his teeth, he needs to see a dentist to fix his teeth. I suggest that he should use electrical toothbrush." 
" Enjoyable fare!!!","The risk of making comedy is sometimes the director chases his tail and goes overboard. So how does Chup Chup Ke fare then? Shahid - One word "mediocore". Kareena - Having missed role of a life-time in Black, I expected her to fight back with stunning performance as a mute girl. "Expectations reduces joy", ah! - I am a wise man now.BTW - the love track between the two appears force-fit. Is it missing on-screen chemistry?Sunil Shetty - Makes entry just a couple of seconds before interval and is his usual self. Neha Dhupia - Wonder how Priyadarshan convinced this glam doll to play second fiddle? Bait: Gets to sing the songs (since Kareena is mute). Nevertheless, meatier and better performance than Kareena. Paresh Rawal seems undisputed king of comedy and his chemistry with Rajpal Yadav is great. Off-late the latter is being accused of substituting Johnny Lever. With Chup Chup Ke, Rajpal Yadav should silence his critics (how long? my guess is as good as yours!). Other Priyan regulars don't leave any lasting impression which include Om Puri and Asrani. Shakti Kapoor's love-track gets axed on the editing table. Anupam Kher, as usual does his part well as a principled father.A couple of songs in the movie are good - thanks to the latest craze, Himesh Reshammiya. The downside - a la Hum Aapke Hain Koun!! The promo song "Shab-E-Firaq" should have been incorporated in the end titles. Off-late the critics are have invented positive statements like "leave your mind at home and enjoy the comedy" which actually means "mindless comedy". Chup Chup Ke luckily escapes this category and scores above Phir Hera Pheri.The comedy track is in right proportion and blends seamlessly with the backbone of the story. Finally what was Sushma Reddy thinking when she signed the dotted line?" 
" Great Story, Awful Remake","This movie is a remake of a Malayalam Movie Priyadarsan made several years ago. The Malayalam movie was genius. It had no trouble mixing comedy and drama. Proving that mixing these two genres is very much possible. Heck the Malayalam movie was so good any person who's watched it, would still stop whatever they're doing to get another glimpse of scenes from the movie if some scene from the movie happens to be played somewhere around them.So why was this movie so much worse than the Malayalam version? Well, let's see what changed, shall we? Pretty much the only thing that changed, was the cast. Actors in the Bollywood version was so horrible, it's incredible. In fact, the only person who acted well in the movie was Kareena Kapoor. Shahid simply did not do a good enough job adapting to the character. Not to an extend that is expected of him, who's otherwise a brilliant actor.Not even the comedians were able to pull of the brilliant Comic breaks that was scripted for them. Bollywood has evolved into an industry people seek to join for it's glamour, and nothing but the glam and money. These days, it only has a handful of good actors. While the rest are popular only due to glam and gossiping. Shameful!" 
" The good news is that Kareena Kapoor doesn't talk in this film. The bad news is that everyone else does","The good news is that Kareena Kapoor doesn't talk in this film The bad news is that everyone else does the problem is that they don't just talk but shout, scream, shriek, screech and yell. Chup Chup Ke continues Priyadarshan's stint with loud comedies. The good news is that this Priyadarshani film has a story to narrate (unlike Garam Masala). The bad news is that this time again the story is a Hindi adaptation of a Malayalam film named Punjabi House (unlike Malamaal Weekly that was his only original Hindi attempt) However the story is interesting enough. Jeetu (Shahid Kapoor) is drenched in debts that he is unable to payback. So he attempts suicide by jumping in the sea only to be caught in the net of fisherman Bandya (Rajpal Yadav). Bandya's master Gundya (Paresh Rawal) in turn has taken heavy loans from Prabhat Singh Chauhan (Om Puri). As a loan security, Gundya keeps Jeetu as a deposit at Chauhan's house, who fakes to be a mute and deaf guy. Chauhan's niece Shruti (Kareena Kapoor) who is actually mute falls for Jeetu. Confusion seeps in the story when Jeetu's ex-fiancé Pooja (Sushma Reddy) comes into picture. The good news is that Priyadarshan's brand of humor is not as bland or slapstick as David Dhawan's recent films. The bad news is that it's not as credible or tongue-in-cheek as a Hrishikesh Mukherjee or a Basu Chatterjee film, either. The movie starts with a bang getting straight to the point. The director doesn't waste time in establishment of the characters. Right from the first scene, the story of the film keeps moving ahead, thereby keeping your interest alive. Priyadarshan doesn't experiment with the treatment of humor though, going on with his trademark style of comedy. The characters play out loud and to the gallery. Another problem with the Priyadarshan brand of comedy is that he stretches the humor in a scene a bit too much and doesn't know where to stop, thereby making it repetitive and monotonous at times. However thanks to some well-written scenes and Neeraj Vora's dependable funny one-liners that range from the witty to the corny ones, the film does succeed in making you laugh. One more bone of contention is that the genre of the film is not just focused at being a comedy. That lasts for the first two hours after which the genre shifts towards drama. After a good dose of laughter in the first half, you don't feel like changing moods with the subsequent on screen emotional outbursts. And while Priyadarshan handles the comic portions of the film in a larger-than-life manner, his treatment of emotions is very much natural. (Not many might remember Priyadarshan as the director of touching emotional films like Gardish, Virasat and Sazae Kala Paani much before he molded himself as a comedy specialist). Conversely, how one wishes it were just the opposite in this film i.e. the comedy to be more natural while one could overlook the heavier side with some passable artificial emotions. The fluctuating genres very much remind of Priyadarshan's Hulchul that too turned intense in the last one hour. Moreover the family setting and characterizations of Suniel Shetty and Kareena Kapoor seems to be directly derived from Hulchul. Priyadarshan has a standard team of actors like Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav, Om Puri, Asrani, Manoj Joshi and Suniel Shetty with whom he extracts fine work. Paresh Rawal is getting repetitive though you love to see him repeat the act. From being a serious actor, Om Puri has already made a transition into the comedy arena with élan. Rajpal Yadav yet again goes over the top, but somehow in this film, this actor steals the show amongst others thanks to the best scenes and lines that he gets. His timing and expressions add to the effect.Like his team of actors, Priyadarshan also has a standard team of technicians in his film like cinematographer Tirru and art director Sabu Cyril. Sabu repeats the typical pillars-in-the-garden set design for the song sequences. The white color in costume designs is consistently maintained throughout the film to impart a pure look to the frames. The good news is that Himesh Reshammiya composes the music of this film. The bad news (for some) is that he even sings some of the tracks here. Amongst other actors, Shahid is quite efficient. Kareena looks gorgeous and since she doesn't have to mouth a single line in the entire film (not even in a dream sequence), you are saved by her otherwise over-expressive dialogue delivery skills. In fact Neha Dhupia gets more scope and she makes the best use of it. Sushma Reddy is restricted only to some 4-5 scenes. Suniel Shetty is getting typecast in these kinds of roles playing the aggressive and protective brother. Soon he might become a substitute for Jackie Shroff. Overall, Chup Chup Ke isn't as silent as the title suggests. However despite it's loose (or loud) ends, it still manages to be a good family entertainer." 
" Funny film!!!","This is a really nice film to watch with your friends and family, i mean when i first saw this movie i really liked it and i would watch it again.Shahid Kapoor is a great actor, he should do films with Akshay or maybe Salman Khan, he is very talented and was very funny in this film, and not to mention he is the next best danced to Hrithik Roshan. Kareena Kapoor was very good in the film, even though i am not a big fan of hers she is very talented and can go far in her career, that is if she picks the right roles. I also liked Anumpam Kher and Shakti Kapoor too also, they were very funny in the film.The music is very good in the movie, my personal faves were "Dil Vich" and "Hare Hare"i really recommend it to everyone." 
" Comedy or Drama?","Being a Priyadarshan movie, everybody must have expected a comedy caper. Even i thought it was a comedy movie until the end when there was no 'hungama' with all the actors running around. Priya's trademark style.The film was okish. The story was decent. But for a Drama subject, i don't see why there were so many unwanted characters. It makes one confused at some point in the movie.The performance were okish by everyone except Paresh Rawal and Rajpal Yadav who were outstanding as always. Shahid Kapoor has a long way before being called a good actor. Kareena Kapoor had a surprisingly small role which she surprisingly performed well enough and she looked very cute and......reddish. Neha Dupia was good too.Catch this on a DVD and watch it with family. Its a clean movie." 
" Sweet film.","It's a sweet film. Comedy is great and story is also sweet, simple and emotional. Very underrated film though it got mixed reviews from audience and critics but I like it" 
" Must Watch!","It's one of the best Bollywood Comedies. In short, It's a must watch Comedy" 
" Not such a good movie by Priyadarshan","I have loved Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul by Priyadarshan because they had the humor that could make me laugh a lot. The jokes in these three movies weren't repetitive and the movie didn't dull down any moment. When I saw Chup Chup Ke with my parents, I kept laughing just because my father was howling in laughter and I fond the movie funny. But when I saw the movie alone again, I did not find it funny at all.Paresh Rawal got too repetitive in his manners and behavior. Shahid was an epitome of over acting. He looked weird rather than humorous playing deaf and dumb. Rajpal Yadav kept playing his usual role as a side kick who is made to do a lot of silly acts. I liked Kareena's acting as it was natural and, thank god, she did not talk throughout the movie. While the Gujarati family, which had Om Puri and a couple of hundreds of people, really addled my mind. I don't think we have wrestlers in Gujarat who keep fighting. Its normally done in the North. And instead of playing Garbo, the family celebrates singing Hindi songs and dancing as if they are Punjabis. I mean, in the beginning, most of the members of the family are shown as if they do not know any Hindi, and in the second part, all are shown singing in Hindi.The second half of the movie was terribly dragging as members of the family kept weeping all the time. The film had too many characters and so, it became a complete mess.Overall, it is a bad movie. So I give it a 4 out of 10." 
" Chup Chup Ka fails to grip!","Priyadarshan's 'Chup Chup Ke' is a below average entertainer from 2006. Priyadarshan known for making over-the-top, mindless comedies, which have worked big time in the years gone by. But 'Chup Chup Ke' is easily one of his weakest fares. Reason? The first hour of the film is entertaining, though the proceedings are slow. The second is plays a complete spoilsport. The track becomes serious, boring and exhausting. Why Priyadarshan why?Performance Wise : Paresh Rawal can never be doubted, he's a legendary actor and he's amazing in all his films. 'Chup Chup Ke' is no exception. Om Puri is delightful. Rajpal Yadav is a such an actor, that which ever role you handover him he'll excel in it no matter what. Shakti Kapoor is one of the finest actors Bollywood has witnessed. He's mind blowing. Shahid has a lot to learn. Kareena is cute. Neha Dhupia and Sushma Reddy impress. Anupam Kher is bland. Manoj Joshi gets no scope. Suniel Shetty is functional.On the whole, 'Chup Chup Ke' has a enjoyable first hr in kitty, but a dull and dragging second hr leaves you yawning." 
" Note to Priyadarshan: stick strictly to comedy!","Chup Chup Ke is a terrible combination of comedy and drama, definitely the two worst genres to mix. From experience, we can attest that Priyadarshan is an expert in comedy and definitely not in drama/romance (with the exception of Virasat). The opening scenes in the film are a turn-off to an audience expecting comedy as it involves a hurt family and Shahid's unsuccessful attempt at suicide, etc. If there's anything that keeps you in your seats its Rajpal Yadav along with Paresh Rawal. The two are comic geniuses and are the saving grace of this film. Kareena comes in much later in the film and has a small, but obviously very important role. Shahid and Kareena give good performances. Neha Dhupia was a bit disappointing. After some comedy, the movie once again shifts gears to a serious mood, and by that time the movie becomes a drag. Songs are lame except for "Dil Vich."" 
" Chup chup ke - Affair with domestic helper","Story line- The hero is in love with Girl A. He meets her 'chup-chup ke' – hidingly....because the money lenders are after his life.The hero is under heavy debts, he drowns and is picked up by a poor boat owner – who uses his boat for fishing. Anyway – the hero lands up in the house of a rich man. The rich family keeps the hero as their servant and since he was somewhat deaf and mute (but actually he was fine – just pretending to be deaf and mute so that he does not have to go back to his own locality where the money lenders will all jump on him!)they gave him small odd jobs to perform.In the same rich and affluent family, there is a girl (played by sex-siren Kareena – who was actually just mute not deaf). So her cousin finds that a new domestic male helper has joined who is also mute! The love story starts! Wow! What an idea sirji!! Whoever has written this utter crap story! OK there is a twist in the tale too – no rich and affluent male was ready to marry Kareena because of her handicap! So all the family members were looking for a suitable groom ...and were unable to find one! Like..... Are you kidding me!? Such a rich female ..plus beautiful and fair too - who will get a huge dowry with her – Indian families with sons will fall at her feet and lick it for the rest of their lives! There are many such educated but not very well off families in India who would do anything for getting a bride from a rich family...watch Saavdhan India episodes if you have doubts! Anyways, she falls in love with the guy who was hired as a domestic helper in the family. Later the beans got spilled and the Girl A – with whom the hero was actually in love comes to now that he was alive. When she confronts him, it was already too late – he had accepted rich and mute kareena – who was obviously much prettier than the Girl A..and was about to marry her! I mean why wouldn't he – he would be able to live happily ever after as a rich man and will even get rid of the money lenders! Girl A was dropped as a dead fly from the milk! End of story Conclusion- I have often heard that there are families –rich and affluent – having huge palatial houses...make the servants render sexual services too! Like fatso wives...whose equally ugly and fatso husbands pick-up (call) girls from the streets for a 'quicky' – or even visit brothels or – if a wee bit more rich – then they book a hotel room and sleep with the females engaged in escort services.Probably this is the reason why kareena's cousin introduces her to the newly acquired helper...at least she could taste...love..making?...since no one was marrying her? Btw. The fact that the females of the house sleep with the servants, drivers, gatekeepers..etc. is known to the males of the family – it is a 'you are OK, i am OK' relationship – the males eff around outside the famels eff around inside...since they are cultured and ethical and traditional – they eff indoors and not hire gigolos! Problem happens when dull headed males watch such films – if they reach some such house- as domestic helpers - where females are sleeping around and game...then things are under control...but if such dumb fools reach a decent, righteous household and try to act fresh (the film after all showed the possibility of the daughter marrying the helper...so such concepts raise expectations as well huh)- then hell breaks loose!...the helper gets beaten by the men of the family first and then by the cops –and ultimately he gets the criminal label for the rest of his life!" 
" What a great concept! A mute Kareena who doesn't show up until after 95mins into the film! Va!","My goodness! This film would have received a poorer rating for me if not for the fact that Kareena Kapoor doesn't talk in the film as well as the fact that you can enjoy the first hour and a half without sight nor sound of her. God bless the director & writer for that alone.Okay, with that said here's the plot in a nutshell: Shahid Kapoor plays Jeetu, a happy go-lucky dude whom we meet down on his luck as all the people he is indebted to have now come to collect. His problem? He doesn't have the money to pay up. Nevertheless, he is witty. He devices a plan to gather all of his collectors into a meeting by the sea where he not only reveals to them that he cannot pay up but also that he is about to commit suicide. Unfazed, most of the collectors encourage him to jump into the sea and that in fact if he does so and drowns, they would forget about the money he owes them. So Jeetu jumps into the sea. The collectors go back to the village to report what has happened and a massive search goes into effect to recover his body, which is never found. Jeetu's family gather by the beach, watching the search efforts and they all take turns reflecting on the sad turn of events and what happened the last time they saw him. Jeetu's fiancée Pooja (played by Sushma Reddy) even decides after this to become a widow for life.Meanwhile, miles away in a remote village in Gujarat, Jeetu's body surfaces in a fisherman's net and in a hilarious skit is taken to hospital by Bandya(Rajpal Yadav) whom found him, and Gundya (Paresh Rawal) his boss. While Jeetu is unconscious, Bandya finds a letter amongst his things and mistakes it for money Jeetu owns, not knowing that it's actually money that Jeetu owes to people. Jeetu awakes to find both men plotting on how to squeeze him for cash and decides to play deaf and dumb to them. Note: Shahid Kapoor plays this in such a stereotypically bad way, it's painful.Bandya, a man in debt on his own now takes Jeetu under his wing but soon gets in trouble with one of his own debt collectors Prabhat Singh Chauhan (played by OM Puri). After another bout of very funny skits, somehow Bandya & Jeetu end up being servants in Chauhan's house to pay off Gundya's debt and there Jeetu meets a truly mute girl named Shruti(played by his real life love Kareena Kapoor) with whom sparks fly. I don't know whether it's because Miss Kapoor was mute in the role but Neha Dhupia who plays Meenakshi manages to outshine her on the acting front. Blink and you'll miss Anupam Kher & Amita Nangia every time they show them briefly as Jeetu's grieving parents. Manoj Joshi play's Pooja's father. Music by Himesh Reshamiya of which only two songs are stellar. 'Dil Vich Lagya' & the henna ceremony song, I can't remember the title of that song but it's really catchy and the video's beautiful. On the DVD, there's a video for one deleted song which features Shahid & Kareena Kapoor. It takes place after Jeetu's suicide scene, Jeetu jumps int the sea and emerges in a mermaid-like lair where Kareena's is Dancing Queen. It looks great but wouldn't have fit into the film's storyline, so they smartly deleted it from the film's final cut. Oh! before I forget, Suniel Shetty is in there too, though you wouldn't know from the promos (I didn't even notice him in the promo for 'Dil Vich Lagya' and he's a big part of the song). He plays Shruti's possessive older brother Mangal Singh Chauhan. Here's hoping Shahid Kapoor collected the fattest salary for this film for all the over-time tight slaps he received throughout the film. LOL!"
