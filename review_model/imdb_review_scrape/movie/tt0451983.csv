" Just Watch Denzel's Out of Time.","I get very ticked off when Indian filmmakers take a Hollywood movie and give it their own spin and call it their invention. In reality all they have done is added some songs in the midst. The master of Plagarising is Bhatt Camp, I could name all of their movies being copies of Good Hollywood movies. Murder-- Unfaithful, Paap--The witness, Awara Pagal Dewana--The whole Nine Yards, Saaya--Dragonfly, Zeher--Out of Time, I am telling you all of Bhatt's movies can be linked to a Hollywood flick. The funny thing is nobody is catched on to it yet, the movie is a frame to frame copy. After couple initial frames it clicked right away. Zeher is a good remake, usually they screwed it up big time. It just bothers me when people give credit to people who have done nothing but watched a English version on their DVD player. As far as the performances go, Emraan had big shoes to fill considering he was playing Denzel's part, he tries but at times in comparison he does not get the same impact as Denzel. Shamita played her role the best but then she was playing Eva Mendez's part, she is not all that known for acting. Udita looked cute in paap, here she looked awful to me. She didn't impress me as far as her performance was concerned. Ninad Kamat played a good part. If this movie was a hit then I feel bad because the audience has been cheated of their money, just go to a video place and get out of time, 2003. Much better movie with a treat of watching Denzel act. If Indian audiences are filled in theatres for some teaser nonsex scenes, might as well watch Hollywood flicks, they show more, do more, and have hotter chicks. I hate Mahesh Bhatt, He is a thief, i don't mind remaking a film, but don't give yourself credit for writing the story or concept, which he does every single time. Although, I would give Zeher a good score, just because its different than other bollyflicks." 
" Get a healthy dose of Zeher Emraan Hashmi style!","Oh this one is a must-watch!!! Emraan Hashmi is absolutely brilliant in this movie. Even though this flick is a copy of Hollywood's "Out of Time", it surpasses its predecessor and is the perfect thriller to watch, especially late at night.The other co-stars Shamita Shetty(Sonia)and newcomer Udita Goswami(Anna) have also given a superb performance. An estrangement between Siddharth Mehra (Emraan) and his wife Sonia leads him straight into the arms of seductress Anna.But this passion is short-lived as Siddharth is drawn into a web of treachery that leaves him struggling not only to prove his innocence but also to keep his affair secret from his wife. The chemistry between Anna and Siddharth sizzles, but the love Siddharth has for Sonia is equally evident.Above all, its such a pleasure to be led on an emotional roller coaster by Siddharth. Watch closely the emotional by-play on Siddharth's face. He has really portrayed all the emotions well, lust, desire, contempt, anger, deception,apprehension, etc.He has a really expressive face, and his voice adapts very well to the mood he's supposed to play. Injecting humor into the tense drama is Siddharth's friend James. Mr.Bhatt is well-known for steamy scenes in his movies, but then, he's not a father figure to the youth..he's just what he is...a film producer, who is out there only to entertain us...He's not there to reform or lead astray the youth.So, please stop pointing fingers at him.He's provided us with a great thriller in Zeher, and if one hasn't watched its Hollywood copy, Zeher is really unpredictable, with twists and turns, and a great climax.The scenic backdrop of Goa is perfect for this movie. The sound track is amazing....Woh Lamhe is a great song to listen to in both, the slow and the fast version. All of Emraan's movies are good, but in Zeher he plays a very mature character, unlike his other boyish roles(eg Aashiq Banaya Apne), and he pulls it off perfectly with a capital P. I have watched this movie about 24 times to date, and each time i've enjoyed it as if it were the first time...The song "Woh Lamhe" holds a special meaning for me, because i've recently lost the love of my life due to a huge misunderstanding, which so far i've been unable to remove. I can go on writing about this movie...Its my favorite Bollywood movie ever, and Emraan is a heart-throb, but i'll end my review here with a recommendation to watch this movie. Its worth your time. P.S Emraan...we want more of you, we love you,from Pakistan." 
" Another bold thriller from the Bhatt camp","Bhatt favorite Emran Hashmi attempts to prove his worth once again and again fails to do so. Udita Goswani also is a damp squib as she lacks expressions and just provides steam to the movie. Shamita Shetty, however, easily steals the show. With Mohabbatein being history, she desperately needed to be relaunched. After losing a lot of weight and having a much more glamorous look, Shamita also bags a powerful role in which she proves that she is here to stay. She does an excellent job, especially in her confrontation scenes with Emran, displaying anger, frustration, suspicion, and sorrow very well. The story is quite interesting. The first half is awesome, but it starts to slow down a bit in the second half. However, in the end it is still a good movie. Songs are good, but Woh Lamhe is undoubtedly the best track of this album and one of the best of 2005." 
" the best ever remake of denzel's out of time","It was the best remake of out of time movie.I saw the movie and like it so much that I want to see it again.This movie is more than a thriller.I recommend it to be seen but pg is to be till 13 years of age The actor is a police whose wife leaves him (she enacts as police superintendent)so the husband takes a job in an insurance policy and finds himself addicted to a beautiful girl wanting the insurance.he secretly visits her, but one night her husband gets to know everything.Next night he plots a trap & burns his house and the actor arrives just at the seen.now the evidence is all against him.e joins the police force and his wife but needs to prove himself innocent before he is caught and at the same time he needs to find out who is making him guilty." 
" 'Woh Lamhe'","Another crap fest from the Bhatt camp. Whither the man who made sublime stuff like Arth and Saransh? And they couldn't even bother to give credit to Pakistani singer Atif Aslam for the only good thing about the film - the song 'Woh Lamhe'. People seem to think it has been sung by Roopkumar Rathod. Why are the Bhatts promoting mediocre, nay, abysmal actors like Emraan Hashmi and Udita Goswami so heavily? This from the people who have worked with the likes of Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil. Really makes me wonder (and gag). And it wouldn't p*** one off so royally if they would just be honest about it and say yes, we are churning out crap because it's cheap and we are lazy and self-satisfied. Instead the pretence that they are producing art. Boo Hiss!" 
" Zeher is the story of a Goa-based police officer (Emran Hashmi) who has parted off ...","Zeher is the story of a Goa-based police officer Siddarth(Emran Hashmi)who has parted off from his wife Sonia(Shamita Shetty) because he feels that women cannot share the same profession as men do . His co-officer James(Ninad) tries to fill up the gap between them but he fails . One day he meets a drug dealer who is along with his wife Anna(Udita Goswami) . Anna is very ill-treated by his husband , this creates some sympathy in the mind of Siddarth for Anna . Soon , this sympathy turns out into love as Anna tries to meet Siddarth when her husband is out of town . Their relationship continues when one day Siddarth comes to know that Anna is pregnant and allegedly he is the father of coming child . The doctor (Dr. Amitabh Khanna) even tells that Anna is suffering from Cancer and has 3 months to go if she is not shifted to a Cancer Hospital in Bombay . As the treatment costs were very high Anna decides to take a LIC-policy and makes Siddarth as its beneficial . Sometimes later , Siddarth comes to know from James that Anna's house is caught in fire and by the time he reaches the spot the couple had died . Then comes the twist in the story as Sonia had been assigned to investigate this death-case . Siddarth is afraid and doesn't wants Sonia to know about her relationship with Anna . He tries to wipe out every evidence that connects her with Anna . For what follows later you need to watch the movie ......" 
" Another Copy from the Bhatt Copy Camp !","I Must start by saying I enjoyed this movie, I Laughed my a** off. ;-) This movie is a frame to frame copy of "Out of Time" (well almost 90%, with songs and some Indianisation) I'm not against such remake or copies, but please give the source movie some respect for god's sake, this movie has no creativity what so ever (apart from the songs, which are GOOD)Emraan and Shamita have tried, but sadly failed. some of their expression are so funny, kinda childish. Notice Shamita's eyebrows, she surprised/stressed through the movie, that the standard expression she has sticked tooOn whole, if need to pass your time, with friends passing comments, this can be enjoyed. otherwise it is a just below average movie, that too just because of the plot. (taking in consideration u have'nt seen "Out of time")" 
" Soapy Soap","Do you like soapy actors and actresses? Soapy lines and writing? Soapy camera work? Soapy music? Oh, and stolen plots and cliches? Then this movie is for you. I gave it the extra star for subtitle quality - very good!" 
" Out of Time","Vishesh films are known for copying films, not that others don't and at least they make better films then YRF even though copies. ZEHER was a copy of OUT OF TIME(2003). The entire movie is almost lifted from the original yet it does have some good scenes and some hit music. The film starts off well, the characters of Emraan, Shamita and Udita are well handled and slowly we get involved in the proceedings though the pace does tend to be too slow sometimes. Even there are hardly few moments between Shamita and Emraan hence their relationship feels good yet the film does manage to startle you throughout if you haven't watched the original. Though it does get predictable too often. The climax too is nothing new and has been done to deathDirection by Mohit Suri(his first movie) was good though the script could be tighter. After assisting the Bhatts in films like FOOTPATH finally Mohit Suri(relative of Bhatt) was launched with this film Music was a big rage, WOH LAMHE was the best song, AE BEKABAR by KK too is good, all songs are fab overallEmraan Hashmi does his role very well, serious roles suit him best and he does a great job, this was his 2nd hit after MURDER. Shamita Shetty does a good job, sadly her career didn't really go miles and she has now quit bollywood Udita Goswami is wooden and terribly dubbed by someone else Amongst rest Samir Kochar does a good job, Ninad Kamat is superb in the typical hero friend role Vishwajeet Pradhan is okay" 
" Same old theme of Aldultery..... Bhatts need to get more creative...","Plot Outline: Inspector Siddharth Mehra (Emraan Hashmi) has just seized a consignment of narcotics and cash and the News Channels air his praises. But on the inside Siddharth suffers from his estrangement with his cop-wife Sonia (Shamita Shetty) on domestic hassles and ego issues; thus making him the typical frustrated guy like in Murder.Siddharth accidentally meets a damsel in distress Anna (Udita Goswami) and soon develops a relationship with her. Anna makes Siddharth believe that she is pregnant and is suffering from cancer and trauma from her wife-beating husband Sean (Sameer Kochhar). Playing Good Samaritan, Siddharth parts with the cash seized from the narcotics raid. Just then, Anna and Sean are reported dead in a fire, which the commissioner suspects is a terrorist activity and appoints Sonia as the special investigating officer on the job.The rest is predictable Bollywood masala. (spoiler not needed at all) Comment: Mukesh/Mahesh Bhatt house needs to come out of the low-budget-skin-adultery vicious cycle after Murder, Jism, Rog, etc. Emraan plays their in-house frustrated character who fails to evoke any sympathy (which he desperately needs for all his roles). The girls compete in a failing battle with Emraan in proving who the worst actor of all is. Roopkumar Rathod gives 'Woh Lamhe', the only hummable song from this movie." 
" Okay film","Well i thought the story was a bit boring, it's the usual type of Indian film , a man meets a woman and has an affair with another woman.Emraan Hashmi is a very underrated actor, he can act and is really good in all of his films that he does, but he does have this label tag for being a serial kisser as in every film that he does he beds his woman, anyway his role was okay but could have done better.Shamita Shetty is a really pretty girl, i really like her, i'm not a fan of her big sister Shilpa but i do think that her sister is a lot more beautiful and talented and can dance better than her sister Shilpa, she also had played her role well in the film.Udita was okay in the movie, but she really needs to pick her roles that she does in her movies , i mean she is very pretty and i know that she has the talent but iv just not seen it yet. you get me? the music is very good and a watchable film." 
" Don't waste your time on this movie","This movie is a scene to scene copy of "Out of Time" starring Denzel Washington. They copied almost 95% of the movie, and even tried to copy some of the costumes, such as Denzel Washington's flowery shirts !!! Even the dialogues were exactly the same, just translated into Hindi from English... Not only was the movie copied, but the song "Woh Lamhey" was taken from a Pakistani singer, Atif Aslam, with no credit given to him at all... Seems like Indian movies can't do anything original anymore... The acting was awful !! Emran Hashmi has neither good looks nor good acting skills. Shamita Shetty is wasting her talent in such movies... I wouldn't recommend any of Mahesh Bhatt's movies because they're always a copy of some famous Hollywood movie, yet he still claims that they're not a copy and everything is "original." Overall the movie was a waste of time..."
