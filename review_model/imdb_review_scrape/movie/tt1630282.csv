" Good Attempt","Sahi Dhandhe Galat Bande is a topical film, this one's an interesting directorial debut by actor Parvin Dabas who captures on screen the recent farmer's agitation in places like Nandigram, Singur, Bhatta Parsaul and several other rural belts which are being grabbed by industrialists and commercial land developers. Sahi Dhandhe Galat Bande does have some rough edges and tends to meander a bit. Too many fringe characters and sub-plots tend to divert attention from the main issue. Nevertheless, there is an earnestness of intent and loads of meaningful content which makes for interesting viewing. The high point of the film are its performances. A serious and sensible debut film by director Parvin Dabas, Sahi Dhande Galat Bande is offbeat and fresh.... ." 
" Needed that "little" more.......","Acting skills of Parvin Dabas barely got noticed for his stint as an actor in Bollywood. Cut to round two, he picks up directorial reigns in "Sahi Dhandhe Galat Bande". What more, he pens as well and acts in it too. In all honesty, its a decent attempt for a first timer. The story addresses a few social issues primarily the knock on effects of capitalism in the agriculture sector. A few sub-plots are nicely woven into the main storyline. Parvin Dabas showcases the new jagged side of himself and perhaps will get noticed this time around. Additionally he tops it up with a few wrestling stunts and gives the audience a peek to his chiselled body. The narrative gives a Tarantino feel (meaning the sepia tone, humour in the face of danger and unexpected bolt from the blue). His three friends give an authentic performance and noteworthy is the camaraderie between them. Sharat Saxena, Yashpal Sharma and Kiran Juneja are dependable and lend adequate support. There was not enough meat in the role for Anupam Kher and Neena Kulkarni. The producer Preeti Jhangiani does a cameo of a news reporter. The narrative could have been polished a bit in order to deliver a punch. Additionally, the start appears hasty and rushed, while the portion in-between sags. Cuts to flashbacks hamper the narrative and could have been avoided. "Sahi Dhandhe Galat Bande" doesn't quite get there and leaves you desiring for more." 
" The Wrong People For The Right Job","Parvin Dabas ventures as writer, director and actor in 'Sahi Dhandhe Galat Bande'. The trailer gave me the impression that it's a dark comedy which it is to an extent. But it's also a social drama that stresses on the influence of capitalism on farmers, causing extreme distress as they are forced to give up their land and live in further poverty. Dabas's intention is sincere and for a debutant, 'Sahi Dhandhe Galat Bande' is a good effort.The toned down colour gives it a slightly earthly feel that stresses on the despair and hardship of the struggling farmers and the characters to find a solution to the problem. Humour is brilliantly used in the first half but lacking in the second where things get too intense (almost to the point of being melodramatic).In the acting department, Parvin Dabas does an outstanding job. He shows a different side of himself as an actor by playing the guy with a rough edge, who had a troublesome past and is conflicted between doing the right thing and supporting his mentor. Vansh Bhardwaj, Ashish Nayyar and Kuldeep Ruhil provide fine support as Rajbir's friend. Sharat Saxena and Kiran Juneja are equally good. Producer Preeti Jhangiani (and wife of Parvin Dabas) does a cameo.My quibble is with how the film is paced. It moves very slowly midway. I felt that some of the minor characters could have been done without.Overall, 'Sahi Dhandhe Galat Bande' is a fine effort and should Dabas choose to direct and write again, I'd be interested in what stories he chooses to tell." 
" A good attempt .......","The Opening :- Sahi bande galat dhande was a good attempt by Pravin Dabbas who incidentally directed his first movie. The Story :- The film revolves around 4 people who are working for one particular gangster Fauji(Sharat Saxena) . Rajbir ( Pravin Dabbas ) just came out of jail after serving sentence for his friends and he and they are assigned a task to clear the village land supposed to be given by Delhi CM to a big builder to destroy the village and build factory. The film takes a sneak peek at the latest controversy of Singur. Unfortunately , Rajbir's father has sold one plot of this land before he died and Rajbir seeks to get it back. He plays the game with Fauji and instead of clearing the land , he supports the villagers and joins the protest. What follows next is the plan to retrieve the land and get back his plot. The review As I mentioned before , this is the first film to be directed by Praveen Dabbas and I would like to mention here that he has put in a sincere efforts. Full marks should be given to him for tackling the story so efficiently. Ditto goes for the performance by the rest of the star cast. The cinematography of the flick is eye-soothing capture the natural essence of north India. Background score is riveting. On the flip side , the screenplay could have been a bit tighter. Overall, the movie is a decent watch. You may want to catch it for eve flick. Good â€“ 3 / 5" 
" Remains far away from its exact destination.","The name was great, the posters were well designed and the subject was well chosen. In fact, the plot was very much in news in the last few weeks only. So the time of its release was also simply perfect. But unfortunately the film fails to materialize on any of these merits and just remains an average kind of first time effort by the writer-actor- director Parvin Dabas. Besides, I was really taken aback by its very poor and sub-standard T.V. promos using the archival footage of our independence without any purpose, which was really not expected from a team having a reasonably good film-experience.So as it began, I already had my doubts about its script and execution. Written around a burning issue of Government taking away the farmer's land in the name of development, the film takes off with reference to four local gang leaders and their don. The first half keeps revolving around these gangsters and their funny kind of gang wars but it doesn't touch the real issue strongly. The director tries to keep this particular part of the film closer to an off-beat kind of venture talking about the life of farmers living in a village situated in the outskirts of Delhi. The writer mixes the gangster plot well with the land taking over issue, plus the script gets its full support from the original locations and some smartly written dialogues for its key sequences.But the film loses both its direction and grip as the gang leader undergoes a heart transformation and decides to take the side of villagers. From here onwards it all becomes too predictable and filmy which fails to generate any kind of interest for the viewers. As a matter of fact, I strongly felt that in order to put too many elements into its narration, Parvin actually ruined the basic thought of the plot and came out with a 'mixed vegetable' kind of film not worth applauding.SDGB tries to bring in the feel of many past HITS forcefully and fails miserably in the process. At times it also looks quite funny & amateur kind of attempt with people shooting, exchanging cars and killing each other without any Police in the scene. The four gangsters remind you of many past RGV films or the youth oriented ones where the boys commit crime along with having fun in the group. It also tries to bring in the Comedy touch as seen in KHOSLA KA GHOSLA earlier which was too based on a similar illegal land acquiring issue. But sadly nothing is up to the mark in the film. Here I also doubt that Parvin Dabas may have thought of making this project while working in KHOSLA KA GHOSLA only and might have roped in Kiran Juneja Sippy and Anupam Kher too having the same in mind.On the performance front, I found Parvin deliberately trying hard to give a polished act in the film which was quite visible. And that may be the reason that he was not able to come up that impressive as the silent explosive man. His other three friends along with the rest of the supporting cast are all fine but nothing great with Anupam Kher simply wasted. Musically also it remains just an average fare though the songs are used smartly in its first half. However the Camera-work capturing the local ambiance works great as required by the theme of the film.Overall, SAHI DHANDHE GALAT BANDE can only be called a well intentioned average first attempt by its actor-writer-director, which remains far away from its exact destination."
