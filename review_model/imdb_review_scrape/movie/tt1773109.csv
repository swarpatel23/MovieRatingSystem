" The Deol's are back and surely with a bang and lot of love.","Loved it, loved it, loved it. This is called an entertainer or in Indian language 'A Paisa Vasool' movie. I call this movie a celebration of the Deol trinity stardom. As per story there's nothing new but that's what most of Bollywood movies are meant to be. They are like fashion which is to be repeated after every three decades but presented in a fresh new way. This process is as difficult as it is easy and this is where YMD stands out. It is a superb comedy blending the old fashion Bollywood separation formula with family love, situational comedy and lot of Deol muscle power.Acting vise all have done a superb job. Dharmendra to be mentioned even at the age of 75, showed that he still holds his charisma and comic timing(reminding the old days of Chupke Chupke), Sunny Deol shines throughout the movie with his acting and never looked so handsome in his carrier while Bobby played very well with his mischievous romeo character. Other supporting cast was great and also the newcomer Kulraj Randhawa was an eye candy with her sweet role.Regarding the screenplay, the first half is not that much powerful and which is the only drawback of the movie. I wanna tel everyone that don't judge this movie on its first half because once the movie steps on the beautiful land of Punjab, the screenplay doesn't stop itself improving higher and higher and also taking our cheeks higher and higher. It becomes such a entertaining laughing roller-coaster ride with no unnecessary cheap jokes and u can feel pain in your jaw at the end . Watch for the Sunny Deol's screaming scene in the fight. This is kind of movie which laughs at itself and makes us laughs too. You will surely get a 'HAPPY' felling at the end. GO FOR IT! and congrats to Deols." 
" A Fun Ride!","I am energetic, happy and glad after watching 'Yamla Pagla Deewana'. Director Samir Karnik brings the 3 Deols together, with such an interesting story, that you fall in love with them. 'Yamla Pagla Deewana' is an out-and-out time-pass fare that entertains it's viewer. The First hour is good, but the Second hour is an absolute knock-out. After 'Dabangg' and 'G3', here comes an entertainer that is sure to be remembered!The writing is spot-on, which is filled with entertaining moments and awesome one-liners. Samir Karnik's direction is perfect. Cinematography is damn good. Stunts are excellent. The soundtrack is nice.Performance-Wise: Dharmendra, Sunny & Bobby are in terrific form. They play their parts with ease. Kulraj is decent. In the supporting cast, Anupam Kher, Mukul Dev, Sucheta Khanna, Puneet Issar and Johny Lever are simply superb. Emma Brown is passable. On the whole, A Fun Ride that deserves a watch. Go for the Deols! Thumbs Up!" 
" Deol Show all the way....","The contribution of the Deol family to Hindi Cinema is not to be underestimated. It gave the first Indian He-Man..Dharmendra who in his hey days used to consistently top polls listing him as the most handsome man in India. Even though he did not win popular Film awards, he is one of the kings of Hindi Cinema.His son Sunny carried on this tradition and has done his family proud.Even Bobby, the youngest son along with their sister Esha has jumped into the movie business.The film is a tribute to the three male Deols', without giving anything away..paying homage to the lost and found formula story our Hindi films. It captures emotion, good locales( Varanasi and good o'l Punjab) as well as tickling the funny bone.Specially, the second half, which brings the house down. The music is not bad and add to this a fresh female actor who does a competent job opposite Bobby. Anupam Kher is a scene- stealer.A word of caution, I saw this movie in a multiplex in a city in Southern India, so a major part of the jokes were a bit difficult to comprehend for the regional audience If you are a bit less informed and are not too familiar with this, ask a friend who is well versed to accompany you. Trust me, you will not regret it.Over all my rating is 6 / 10Enjoy !" 
" The good run of 2011 continues with a Dabangian kind of entertainment for the masses by the Deol Family.","The Deol family is back after APNE giving you a Dabangian kind of a feeling in which even when you know that its all illogical, full of loop holes and also over the top, yet you do enjoy the most of it with a smiling face and also laugh at certain sequences occasionally. In other words I felt like watching a new DABANGG made in Punjab where we have Sunny Deol punching the villains and throwing them mercilessly like the rotten vegetable bags lying in the godowns.Before writing further, I would like to say that its not at all logical at any place, so all the critics looking for some meaningful cinematic value in it may get disappointed. But at the same time its also not a silly or head-aching loud comedy made on the lines of Priyadarshan's last few comic ventures. Though it has a Priyan kind of a climax but overall the script uses its four ingredients - action, comedy romance and emotion quite effectively in the narration which in the end leaves you mostly satisfied. So, if you loved watching its trailer, then the chances are that you would surely enjoy the movie equally, if not better.Starting with an expected solid Sunny Deol fight scene, the director Sameer Karnik makes his intentions clear that I am only interested in giving you entertainment and nothing else. Beginning from Canada, the film reaches Benaras when Sunny visits the city in search of his father and brother. Here Dharmendra and Bobby Deol are introduced as the famous con-men of the city but I seriously felt that the entry of our lovable Dharmendra could be much better.Frankly speaking YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA is one of those few movies whose second half is better than the first saving the film on the whole. The first half is just fine entertaining you in bits and parts. But it starts dragging after an hour with few un-required songs (why 2 item numbers in the bar) and a not so impressive romantic angle which should have been deleted at the editing table itself. Post intermission the film moves at a great speed and has many more entertaining moments (with only 1 song) as compared to its first half. And that's what saves the movie literally and wins the game. The writer Jaswinder Singh Bath is highly inspired by the folk story of MIRZA SAHIBA along with movies such as DDLJ and JAB WE MET which clearly shows in his second half. Especially the second half belongs to two more performers other than the Deol family. And they are Anupam Kher, as the girl's father and Mukul Dev as the girl's elder brother. Anupam Kher is simply too good in the character of Joe Bhaaji. He is comic, he is loud, he is hilarious and yet elegant in his own impeccable style which is another achievement by the veteran actor once again. Accompanying him impressively is Mukul Dev speaking Punjabi so fluently as if he is a regional actor taken from the Punjabi theater. I really doubt that the viewers would even recognize him in his Punjabi getup having long hairs. Both Dharmendra and Sunny Deol give a very controlled yet effective performance, which remains the highlight of the film. They both are sure going to get all the claps and seeties in their own north belt undoubtedly. In short Sunny is going to be loved and Dharmendra is going to be cherished by his fans after a long time. Coming to the youngest of the three, Bobby Deol, he gets the maximum attention in the story as the main character for whose love interest, the whole drama is played in the second half. Bobby looks smart and does fine both in the get up of a con-man in the first half and as a Sikh NRI in the second. In the remaining cast Kulraj Randhawa scores the best looking gorgeous on the screen much better than many famous big names of the Industry. Johny Lever and Sucheta Khanna are great. Nafisa Ali and Amit Mistry make an impact in their brief roles. Emma Brown Garrett, as Sunny's foreign wife is surprisingly good with her two Sikh Kids. Most of the audiences really laughed out loud whenever one of the kids used to say "Ditto". Himanshu Malik is OK but Puneet Issar gets wasted having nothing substantial to do in the script. Cinematography of YPD is eye- catching capturing the outdoors of both Benaras and Punjab. But the dialogues and the action are the real jack here which fit in perfectly matching all the Punjabi characters.Coming to the biggest weak point of YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA, it is the music which should have had more Dhol and Punjab in it instead of 2 item numbers (in the bar) and 2 romantic songs. In the whole soundtrack I found only one song "Charhaa De Rang" having the much required melodious notes in it. Other than the soundtrack its a lengthy movie of almost 3 hours of duration which essentially required editing at many places. Moreover, the writers could have thought of another climax moving away from the usual Priyadarshan kind of an ending and the director at least could have shown the role of Police in our system somewhere in its 3 hours (There is no Police anywhere in the movie throughout).However another merit of the movie I would like to mention here is the appreciable sarcasm incorporated beautifully in its script regarding the passion of Punjab with NRIs and VISAS. I really hope the people living in Punjab would take a note of it while watching this.In all, it's entirely a masses entertainment movie on the lines of DABANGG, which should be loved by all fans of Deol family especially the viewers in the North Belt of the country." 
" Entertaining? Yes Sir!","If Deols were looking to redeem themselves from the disaster that was 'Apne', they certainly have with this one. The movie makes great use of Sunny's He-Man image with exaggerated but visually stunning action sequences(with a sensational Dhol+Electronic Guitar background music which they should have released with the album), Bobby's energy and Dharmender's mere presence on the scene.First half, though, not nearly as mad as the second, is helped by Two good item numbers and Johnny Lever's cameo. Second half is riot. When all the Punjabi characters with their Punjabiness come to the fore. Anupam Kher is impeccable as ever in his comic timing. The Canada obsessed cousin was hilarious along with the Family friend, the Flashy clothes+Goggle sporting character. Kulraj Randhawa is cute and efficient. But undoubtedly, its Mukul Dev's drunkard guy that gets the best scenes and dialogs. Amongst others, Emma Brown- the wife that scares living daylights out of Sunny Deol of all people and the kids, especially the smaller one(with his limited vocabulary syndrome) are a treat.10/10 as I went there to get entertained and I was." 
" Excellent..super fun..Comedy,..totally loved this mass entertainer ...","Best comedy film..as it has got everything they promised..action..drama..comedy and lot of confusion..sunny plays it perfect..and dharmendra doing very well too..bobby performs quite well too..Kulraj is sexy and cute..and everybody plays their part good. Rahul Dev should act more..he was good and drunken brother..anupam kher lights up the screen..sucheta khanna is good too..as a desperate girl to go to CANEDA..lol..music is good too..I loved title track and chadha de rang.. A must watch family entertainer movie..Definitely recommended!!!! very good movie please go and watch samir karnik did good direction.. really loved it totally.." 
" Absolute Fun","Promos for YPD have made it a must watch for everyone and the movie fulfills its promise. It starts with a story of lost father Dharam (Dharmendra) and brother Gajodhar (Bobby) in search of whom Paramveer (Sunny) comes from canada to India. He founds them at the start only but the problem is to make them loose their habit of mugging up people and bring them back to his mother. The funniest parts come in when he joins them. After Interval movie picks up pace and gets funnier. In between Gajodhar falls in love with a sikh girl sahiba (Kulraj Randhawa)and a new funny story of trying to run with that girl starts as her 5 brothers wants her to marry an NRI only. Paramvir helps them to run but gets himself involved. Then Dharam gets in it and stuck. Then the whole family gets involved in this matter. Good Jokes on sunny's supernatural hulk behavior are everywhere in this movie. Bobby's role is different from all other movies. Songs are average except Title Song. Movie is an absolute watch for everyone." 
" Don't Just Sit There Reading Reviews, Get UP & Go Watch it NOW!","In simple context, it hits the spot & you get a taste of Indian cinema before the so called Bollywood era that has started.Loads of Trivia to look out for in this movie which is exciting as your taken back in time.Dharmendra has made an astonishing amount of films which has given many different audiences satisfaction but as per always the media and/or critics would rather not acknowledge a great actor. Long overdue credits ought to be rewarded to this talented person & his sons.Hurry-Up, Get-UP & Go Watch it...PS: I'd pre-book or get to cinema before hand as I thought it wouldn't be so busy during the afternoon on a weekday...I was wrong, it was too busy that I had to make do with the first seat I set my eyes on." 
" Its official bobby can't act","what an awful totally over acted yuck movie by legendary bollywood mens.It would be a time waste even to write a review for such a drastic movie. First of all there is no story and so much over acting by bobby that you cant survive yourself in the multiplex watching this poor flick finding it damn hard to give a reason why brother why you made such a movie. As you know Dharmendra doesn't act much in movies nowadays but if you wanna know why he chose this movie then i tell you because his personal life has been a disaster like this movie and he want to show his part to his wife how he's been living without her(pardon me sir),but sir you better go & learn some tips from the legendary AL PACHINO/BRUCE WILLIS to how to showcase that missing part,that loneliness on a 70 mm screen or not to choose these ugly nonsense movies to ruin our precious time & money." 
" A Funjabi ride which will entertain you all night :D","To be honest,i am going to keep this short and simple. the first part of the film was funny but the second part was absolutely hilarious - it was legend.also if you love the Deols, this film is for you. always watch out for sunny Deol's parts because: in my view he was the best in the whole film A proper JATT always watch out for the fight scenes because at one point it is him against 50 goons with bats and pipes and when anyone would try to hit sunny - he wouldn't get hurt instead the bats and pipes would snap in half - LEGEND I LOVE IT and SO WOULD YOUAll together it is a great fun for the family because it is awesome" 
" Cheap Comedy for cheap audience","Thought the trailer of the movie looks good however the Movie is very cheap. Bobby deol does not know how to act. Neither the movie writer knews how to write good Dialogs for him.The Movie starts with very good style and gives a good hope however as the movie goes you feel that director tried to portray Sunny deol as Rajnikant and Dharmendra as Salman khan of Dabaang with very very cheap item songs. After watching this movie u will be learn that Dharmendra has clearly become too old to act he can't dance of give out dialog with a speed and flow required for a young Role.The end of the story has spoiled image of Dharmedra even further. A classic hero is replaced by a old man who tries to cheers seemingly only very cheap audience.After watching this movie ,,, i realized that "thees maar khan" was still better then some of the movies in the world." 
" Good attempt by Deols in comedy","Previously three Deols came together in APNE which was a boxing family drama. With YPD they venture into new territory - comedy. Is this attempt successful ? Yes !This movie is about journey of sunny paaji to India from Canada in search of his father and younger brother. So first half is dedicated to formation of plot and is based in Benaras. Real fun begins in second half in punjab. With bizarre situation created they succeeds in making you laugh. Dharam paaji, sunny paaji, bobby all are good in there performances but special praise should go to Anupam Kher for his hilarious performance as eldest brother of heroine. There is no much innovation in story, music is average.Overall a nice entertaining movie. My rating - 7/10" 
" Deol's Are back","Deol's are back with a bang. Good Movie to watch. Lots of Laughter and action, A little bit of emotions. Sunny deol an NRI lives in canada. comes to India to take back his father and younger brother who were the biggest thug in banaras. But Bobby deol fells in love with a girl and her brother take her back to punjab. Sunny deol comes with a plan. and they go to punjab. to get their love back.Sunny deol great acting as action star with his 2 1/2 kg hath. bobby deol acting is OK. Dharmendra the new young man with his dance and action. First half is nice with lots of laughter and little action. The second half is icing on cake with lots of funny moments and confusion with the final action sequence of sunny deol is cherry on top." 
" Why oh Why","This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. After watching Dhobi Ghat and Band Baja Baraat, I thought that maybe Bollywood was finally growing up. But no. There is still an abundance of this mindless nonsense.Zero Plot. Zero acting skill. Slap stick jokes that feel like a slap to the face. And to top it all off, a waste of one of the acting greats Anupam Kher (No not Dharmendar. After this movie, Dharmendar can no longer be considered any where in the league of the acting greats).While other actors have redefined themselves (See Amitabh, Mithun), Dharmendar remains convinced that the childish antics of his hey days still appeal to audiences. Sunny Deol might as well apply for the award for "least subtle self proclaimed superman". People just bounce off him like flubber. The other actors seem to be content playing shadow roles and riding on the expectation that audiences will just show up at theaters because of the big names. The sad part is, if you look at box office numbers, this seems to be working.The movie adds nothing and takes away whatever time you spend watching it. Avoid at all costs." 
" Deols are back with a bang !!!!!","Yamla Pagla Deewana is a movie full of energy and the Deol charisma assuring entertainment for the masses.The Deol magic is maximum utilized again after apne(2007) and the movie relies on the image of the Deols.Dharmendra is a delight to watch on the screen with his wits and emotions.Bobby Deol comes up with one of his best performance and shows his comical skills along with keeping his old lover-boy-romeo image.Sunny Deol catches the limelight by his Rajnikanth style action with a macho-man image(what he does the best) and also shows his light humor quotient.New actress Kulraj Randhawa does her job well and is a promising talent.Direction by Samir Karnik is excellent and he make the audiences,esp the masses to go woo with a perfect mix of Masala-action,comedy,romance,songs and all..Few let-backs of the movie are a slow first half,average editing and exaggerated fights.Music by a bunch of music directors,like Rdb,Anu Malik and Rahul Seth suits the movies theme well and entertains the audience;esp the title song and the songs Charha De Rang and Sau Baar,which are choreographed equally well. In a nutshell this is an entertaining Masala movie-exploring the flavors of the true Indian cinema integrated with drama,emotions and humor,recalling the good old days of Bollywood.Ma rating:8.5/10" 
" Funny as Hell.","How would you like to find out that you have hidden talent when you are in your 60s!? Dharmendra, was one of the most handsome actor of the Hindi cinema or any cinema. In his prime, he was a box office magnet churning out more films than he can count. The scene where he cons the jewellery store (do you take credit card?) is pure mirth..the punch line was this oriental looking kid..a plant. The chemistry between the Deol's, is better than any trio on the screen. The comedy clips are short with a good topper specially in the first half. The movie is well written with a crisp dialog. The best acting is Dharmendra, followed by Bobby, who is prone to over acting. Sunny, is good in what ever he does. The rest lncluding the debutant (great looking gal, compared to the usual fare of talentless can;t act can't speak Hindi-Katrina's) and Anupum Kher, who is just hilarious shooting blanks. This movie is not cheap and stupid like the "Three Idiots" "Dhabaang" and "Tees Mar Khan" which are obviously produced by The "Scum of Bollywood." These Idiots should be kicked out to Andaman or Nicobar, like we used to send the criminals and under achievers and maggots. These scums have no class, taste or talent and taken the glorious Hindi Cinema (Sangam, Guide,Jodha Akbar) down the toilet since this is where the scums belong. Their only goal is to enrich themselves at the cost of the Hindi Cinema duping the audience with clever advertising and bribing the Award Organizers. The recent awards for "Dabaang" is an example of how the lowlifes in media (the two-by-four chai-chamcha's, who wash the behind of these Idiots-the the ugly scum, the arrogant midget, and the ape with muscles) have put them in pedestal and damaged the Industry. They should made to wash the feet of Deols before unloaded to Andamaan!"
