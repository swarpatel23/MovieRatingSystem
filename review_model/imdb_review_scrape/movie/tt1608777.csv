" Blurring the difference between the camera and the director","India has never been as innocent as it consistently claims to be. If you are, however, one of those naïve citizens sitting behind a veil of ridiculous reasons who actually believes this, then I couldn't feel sorrier for you. In fact, if you pay closer attention to reality, you might never look at our beloved nation the same way again. One simple Google search and you will find an alarming amount of voyeuristic material of folks in brazenly compromising positions peppered all over the Internet. And no – it isn't just those light headed, dizzy for that fifteen seconds of fame teens or fellers in their early 20s who are churning out these clips either – no. A good amount of it comes from middle aged, aging, and even ancient crisis-ridden junta who are desperate for some sort of thrill in their otherwise mundane and excruciatingly cliché-laden lives that contains nothing more than mindless work. With that preface done with – let us now focus on Dibakar Banerjee's latest offering 'Love, Sex aur Dhoka' (LSD). I am sure enough spice has already been generated thanks to the extremely obvious hint in the title itself of a dozen saucily executed romp scenes just waiting to tease your aphrodisiacal senses. And yes – this will also take a good amount of our sex-starved nation's goggle-eyed wannabes to go see the flick too. But that's when the fine line between those who went into the cinema expecting a popularized version of a badly edited B-grade mallu movie type sleaze-fest and the ones who walked in expecting a new way of storytelling becomes quite apparent. A divide, I am hoping, will have more fans in the latter category.After watching the 1 hour 40 something minute dish called LSD, one thing is certain. Dibakar is one of those refreshingly cocky bunch of film makers who are quite unperturbed by what the mass populace has to say as long as their distinct tone of message is sent across without fear. It is in this essence of movie making, that Dibakar scores points in my book. Come what may, he seems to say, I will show you my vision the way I want you to see it. It is in this raw, unedited, low-light/night-shot array of frames that the much needed breaking of stereotypical shackles Indian cinema is bound with can be heard – loud and clear. If only, of course, you are willing to listen. If only, of course, you are willing to acknowledge.LSD is completely shot via hand-held digital cameras, security cameras installed in public places and hidden spy cams tucked away in not-so- obvious spots. The tale unwraps with three distinct stories of Love, Sex and Dhokha – as is obvious in the title. What is not so obvious is the way Dibakar stitches the characters in each of them so craftily that the moments where their connections become apparent are truly memorable. The minimalist usage of background music layered with the brave attempts at showcasing emotions in their true and blue nature emanating from nameless faces is truly a new attempt in Bollywood. Actually it is quite new to Indian cinema too.My take on the execution part of LSD is more to do with technique and philosophy rather than the stories themselves. Sure, the plots have their moments but they aren't anything we haven't already heard of or seen. Some of the scenes are overdone and there are even characters that let you down by actually 'acting'. So, in my humble opinion, walking into LSD to expect it to sweep you off the feet with the narrative could be a tad misleading. What I would hope you pay special attention to is how the fine line between fiction and reality gets blurred without you even realizing it. There came a point in the film when my wife turned to me and said 'This is nonsense! It just seems like they have stitched together some clips from YouTube!'Notwithstanding her disapproving conclusion on the film, I must say, that is exactly what Dibakar was trying to achieve. Fading out that line where you forget these people are actors and that they do realize there is a camera somewhere recording their actions.My suspicion with this theme then is the following. LSD will have two clear opinions. One - folks who loved the piece and understood the intentions with which Dibakar shot the flick and narrated the tale the way he did. And two, a majority from what I can tell, who absolutely hated the movie and found it annoyingly ambitious and contrived in its bizarre Hollywood-style-pretentiousness like approach executed in a rather disturbing and amateurish fashion. Either way, LSD will evoke a reaction in you that will stay long with you after having long left the cinema.My recommendation then? Go watch it. Not just to love it immensely or hate it profusely, but to be part of a threshold that has never been tapped on before. To be witness to a milestone in Indian film making where the director is absent from the scenes. To be an audience to a movie where the camera is calling the shots. Just for this, LSD to me will be a unique movie watching experience. And yes – do also watch it before a dozen more remakes flood the market claiming to be better than the original." 
" An intense movie about frantic lives.","What seemed like a tiny blip on the radar has by now completely shaken the entire network of film industry spread across the country. Easily a milestone in Indian cinema this path breaking film is arguably better than most blockbusters released this year, or for that matter any year.The underlying mood of the film being antiestablishmentarianism, LOVE, SEX aur DHOKHA is a raw and uncompromising take on life. Deliciously entertaining, intensely honest and fiery in its mission, LSD is a riveting ride you won't forget. Showcasing the pitiable plight of hopeless underdogs and their frantic attempts to live up against the misfortunes thrown upon them by the establishment, LSD is a running commentary of social satire at its peak. Epitomizing contemporary social scenario, LSD has an intensity that is disturbingly painful and shockingly shameful leaving you with memorable characters of outcasts, misfits, freaks and geeks. A real gem, this cinema is a challenge on the sensibilities of the Indian movie watching crowd to re-discover their sensitive sides.Showcasing a disruptive chronological order (la strada, memento, pulp fiction) this spellbinding mockumentary, a boon for true film lovers, is not to be missed. The outstanding nonlinear narrative structure with three stories cleverly intertwined is truly refreshing to witness compared to boring social lectures of epic proportions which has become the hallmark of mainstream Indian cinema. Perhaps the most fascinating thing LSD belts out is Life as it is. It serves you a slice of current life on a platter for you to relish. Stand back in awe. This film is the sign of times.An intense movie about frantic lives, the neoclassic LSD is a dizzying ride from silence that screams from a dead couple, to dreams and desires being annexed and annihilated by the engulfing fire of penury. LSD explores a dystopian world where love, bending knees, gets buried, amid deranged relationships between desperate people. LSD is definitely an entertaining attempt in the guise of black comedy to disembark and expose a self-righteous dysfunctional, hedonistic, dystopian society gone haywire. Go ahead and laugh yourself silly over its dark humor as you're caught glued to every passing frame of this slick horror drama. Ultimately the joke's on you (Read : society) as the superlatively captivating tongue in cheek title song embarks with the credits rolling in the end. What a show.Delivering a sledgehammer impact with a treatment as furious as the message, Dibakar Banerjee is the man on fire scorching all those who resist him. Bold. Daring. Dangerous. Dibakar is a force to reckon. With dollops of attitude and awards predicted worldwide, this director is here to stay. Open your eyes. The master has arrived. This director has single handedly made the badshahs of this trade redundant with his genius. Uprooting the pundits of this industry as well, with simple plots and unheard actors. This is modern-day cinema at its best.Having acquired a cult status with a cult following within days of release.. LSD is addictive. For some, it's an obsession. I say it's a belter." 
" Light, Sound aur Dibakar","How many times does it happen that during the 8.30 am 'first-day-first-show', you also have one of the lead actors watching the film? It happened today. The actor was Raj Kumar Yadav, who plays the lead in the second story of the film, with his bunch of friends, to cheer at the CBFC certificate and clap at the rolling credits. The film was LSD – which is going to be remembered as one of the gutsiest film ever made in this country. And if you ask me, it is one of the better made ones too.Everyone is talking about the use of digital cameras in the film, that shake, that go out of focus, that even get stained by blood and water. They are talking about how 'different' it is in its theme, style and use of unknown actors. But it is not the elements that make this film different and significantly better than most of others, it is how the director uses them - an evidence of how cinema can be created by a basic understanding of the medium, of picture and sound, and storytelling, and how a style can be carved out of the technology you use. And this technology, as Godard et al taught us, need not be expensive or state-of-art.There are scenes in the film pictured in long single shots – as there is just one evident hidden camera. Unlike other films, here you do not have multiple camera setups, so you can not cut between shots – unless you want to use the obviously jerky jump-cut (which in my opinion often breaks the dramatic build-up of the scene). So, you obviously can not 'cut time' and hence the scene occurs in real time, giving you not only dialogue but also the pauses between them – those significant, dramatic moments between the conversations. And to add to that, there is no background music here, only ambient sound. By something as basic as this, the director has managed to create unforgettable cinematic moments and deeply affecting scenes. This is just one of styles adopted by LSD – that makes it truly different, as far as Hindi films are concerned.You will find so many similar small but brilliant international films in festivals. This time, thanks to the producers, we have one such gem from India, released commercially. I pray for its success – it will help not only independent and digital cinema, but Hindi cinema in general. After Khosla ka Ghosla and Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!, with LSD, Dibakar Banerjee establishes himself as one of those few men in our industry, who know cinema, and who have an expression of their own. And I must congratulate and thank him for proving once again, that to make a good film you hardly need budget and stars. You just need to have a story you are dying to tell, and the cinematic vision, the heart, and a little guts, to do that." 
" One of the best Bollywood movies from the recent past","Love, Sex aur Dhokha (LSD) is the 3rd movie directed by Dibakar Banerjee after the hit comedy Khosla ka Ghosla & the entertaining Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!. All the actors were newcomers. The movie is produced by Ekta Kapoor ((who, if you are an Indian you would know, is responsible for the daily psychological torture of millions of Indians (mostly males)).The movie has 3 stories each representing a part of the title. All the 3 stories are shot in a voyeuristic manner. The first story deals with a richgirl-poorboy love story & is shot from the perspective of a hand-held amateur video camera. Most of the humour in LSD is in the first story. The base for the second story is MMS sex clips & is shot from a CCTV camera angle. The third one is about the casting couch & is filmed mainly through the view point of a sting/hidden camera. Although the 3 stories are independent of each other, the characters in the 3 stories are connected. The film itself is non linear in nature as the three stories are running simultaneously.I generally like innovative opening credits & LSD starts with interesting title sequence. So I advise not to miss the opening. All the actors have done very good job especially considering that this is their debut. Another good thing about LSD is that it has no songs save for one along the end credits. Background score, although not spectacular, isn't bad either. As mentioned earlier traditional camera isn't used here. So the movie is a little grainy at parts & may take a few minutes to get used to.The end to the 2nd story is a bit forced. Some clarity & development was necessary for the motives of Rashmi for what she does at the end. Also the third story appears a little contrived at parts. Apart from these minor glitches the movie was very well written.Dibaker Banerjee has tackled a very dangerous & taboo subject in a superb manner. Full marks to him. Bollywood is lucky to have directors like him, Anurag Kashyap & Vishal Bhardwaj.LSD is a very disturbing movie to say the least. The director has ventured into a risky territory but the movie is definitely worth the risk. Most of the people are not wired to acknowledge the perils of the society that they live in. Generally people tend to ignore & forget the evil or loathsome deeds that they see or hear as soon as possible. They tend to live in their own fantasy lands forcing themselves that all is well. In fact yesterday the front page headline of Times of India is about a 12 year old girl who was repeatedly raped for the past year by not only her cousin but also by another 7-8 people (including a 65 year old man) in her locality. For every couple of weeks there is a news report about an honour killing in Haryana. For every official report there are numerous unofficial ones. But very few people remember these things for this pollutes the general feel good factor that they have towards society (read themselves). It is safe to assume that most of the people will forget the above mentioned headline in a very short time. To tackle such realistic subjects needs a lot of courage. The whole team of LSD should be applauded for their effort.To remove any apprehensions regarding the word sex in the title, there are no explicit sexual scenes in the movie. A special note regarding the back drop of first story. Actually the love story in it was supposed to have a caste based divide. But the great Indian Censor Board (which doesn't even have a working website & which probably has a rating system from the Ashoka era) has objected to this & forced to change the caste divide into rich-poor divide. A double thumbs-down to the Indian Censor Board. With the caste background the first story would have been more gritty & genuine.This is the kind of movie where a viewer doesn't have any midway opinion after watching. You either like it immensely or abhor it. I for one am in the former category. Irrespective of what your peers say, I strongly recommend you to watch Love, Sex aur Dhokha at least once." 
" Worth watching experimental cinema from Mr. Dibaker Lucky Khosla on the lines of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's movies.","Welcome Mr. Dibaker Lucky Khosla back on screen, representing the new age Bollywood Cinema of the current times from the front. With a completely unexpected, novel and experimental kind of project, the director returns with a bang, walking on his own invented path, breaking all the pre-existing molds of film-making in India. His latest may or may not get instant appreciation from the common man, but will undoubtedly be remembered as an important breakthrough in Indian Cinema and its thought process on the medium.First of all, don't go for this movie, simply expecting many over the top, sexual sequences showing the skin, as suggested by its title. As a matter of fact, if you are just there in the theater, to watch a sex-movie then you are going to be disappointed a lot. Because this is not merely a sensational piece of work, trying to cash on its title and sex scenes. On the contrary LSD is a thought provoking film, which forces you to think about whether there still exists any private life in this fast progressing technical world around us? The movie basically showcases three distinct youthful stories, which have the important ingredients of love, passion, greed and lust in different dosages. All the three, are related to each other in a peculiar way, quite similar to the movies of the world renowned director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu of Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel fame. However, Dibaker shows the interconnection between the 3, only towards their respective ends which actually provides another surprise element into the narration and works to a great extent. As far as camera-work is concerned, he also seems to be inspired from the recent Hit project shot on handy cam called "Paranormal Activity".Content wise, once again the director indicates his immense liking towards subjects inspired from the real life incidents. The movie is full of cases which you may have heard or seen on the net in the recent past. There are clear references of real life episodes such as Miss Merrut's sting operation, MMS clips of a newly-wed, Sex clips of a young couple in a store and a Hip-Hop singer speaking Punjabi and getting involved in the case of casting couch. In fact Dibaker Bannerjee has got an unmatchable skill of using the real life news clips in his projects. And this is a proved fact, taking into account, both his previous movies which were highly inspired from real life facts and characters. However, his films might not always be a pleasant experience to watch with the entire family due to his overuse of abusive language and inclusion of highly suggestive sexual scenes in the scripts.Besides this, the other exclusive master touch possessed by the director is the way he uses Punjabi language in his dialogues and also names of famous places of Delhi in his sequences. For instance just notice the way, the morning shift store girl (in the second story) speaks her dialogues with a distinctive Delhi Punjabi accent. It clearly shows the strong influence of Delhi and its friendly punjabi life style on Dibaker. Frankly speaking, I can easily vouch that till date the most authentic portrayal of the city Delhi and its life style can easily be found in all the three movies coming from the talented director in the recent years.Coming to the technical aspects of the movie, Yes, the camera is shaking, the images get blurred and there is a substantial use of night vision. But these all concern you only for a few initial moments and that's it. After the first few scenes, the subject takes you in and you simply forget about all the technical hitches coming on the screen at regular intervals. Especially the opening titles of the movie explain it all and help in building up the right mood for the movie's novel concept and treatment.Cinematography is simply superb, very realistic and leaves such an impact that at times you don't even remember you are watching a movie in the theater. Particularly the use of Handy cams, security cameras and spy cameras is really commendable. Editing is fast, crisp and very close to the real life movement we all witness in our daily lives. Musically, the title track is very catchy and already popular in the youth. Another song of the movie, which had very vulgar lyrics, could not make it to the screen due to the strict censorship. But strangely, it is openly discussed by the characters in the third story. Also the creative artwork of the movie deserves a special mention as it highly innovative and suggestive. The film consists of all new talents who are able to impress and never ever show the signs of their first project on screen. Everyone just looks like his or her character in the script and their collectively effort is a real treat to watch.The ruling queen of the small screen, Ekta Kapoor has made a very noticeable debut in the genre of experimental cinema, which will surely bring her both profits and appreciation together. And what to say about the director, Dibaker Bannerjee! He won millions of hearts with his first two movies and now once again delivers a worth watching & path breaking project consistently. Unarguably, he is one of the most talented and innovative directors of our times who can ensure you serious content along with his own stamp of comedy and satire.In simple words, if you eat, live & drink cinema then you are sure going to love this great piece of art. And for all other friends, who only watch movies as just another form of entertainment, you may or may not like it..but you will not be able to neglect it." 
" Completely LSD...","It is easy to review a movie; they say. In many ways it is. We go for movies, we feel inspired, awed, touched, redeemed etc. Our plethora of the abstract is bolstered by the very existence of the notion that beyond our daily weariness there is a world of cinema, where people make movies and we can be entertained.Then there are those who are part of the 'Divulge' process. This would only happen if you have every attempted to catch something on camera; not accidentally but intentionally. Staged it; you framed it, cut it & displayed it. We so called Movie Buffs love criticizing the effort and all that the Film Maker wasn't able to accomplish in comparison to the IMDb Top Ranked Movies.I once had an interview at RGV factory to work as an unpaid intern; which I had to decline due to academics. Then, I remember boasting to my interviewer of my ability to take a scene and give him at least seven different ways of shooting it. We all are self made maestros in some way or the other. Movies being something we relate to, we are sure we could've done a better job.Today I saw a movie called Love, Sex & Dhoka. Today I do not need to talk about Tarantino, Kubrick or Goddard. Today, I want to talk about Dibakar Banerjee. A director who has taken Indian movies to a pedestal where neither European Maestros, Spanish Cinematographers, Iranian Script Writers or British Actors could go.He nailed his script with Khosla ka Ghosla. He nailed his screenplay in Oye Lucky Oye. Now he nails his content with LSD. The movie is cinema at its best. It tells us that we do not need exploding cars or flaming superstars to make good movies. We need brilliant performances; and this movie has the best I have seen.I was almost in tears in the start, I laughed at every joke of the movie, the thrills were superlative, the dialogues were a level above Pulp Fiction, the flow was gripping and the movie is without doubt the best movie I have seen in a long time. It is bold as Da Vinci, dark as a Grimm Fable, as real as the summer sun and as detailed as a Wordsworth poem about majestic beats worked upon in the workshops of the abyss.Many would question my perspective on the movie but those who know me well would have guessed by now I do not want to reveal anything. But I ask you to go watch it; see what goes into a movie when all you have is the will to entertain, inspire, awe, bevel the audience with humour, strike the emotions with subtle romance and most of all give us a glimpse of film making that would certainly go down in history as a continuation of the legacy that compounds all the talent, previously baptized as Ray, Kurusawa, Kubrick and at least for this movie – this moment Dibakar Banerjee.My rating 4.5 stars out of 5." 
" "A Rare experiment in Indian cinema."","The intriguing part of the film is its found footage genre. One rarely sees experiment in Bollywood. And that's why the film should be watched once. The film does not have any big star and involves new actors due to which the film gives a feeling of reality. The film is divided into three stories justifying the title. All three stories are awesome and the way that they are linked is more amazing. This is another masterpiece from Dibakar Banerjee.PROS:The screenplay is good so no matter what, you are bound to sit once you have started the film. The acting by all is satisfactory. All three stories have been given full attention and full development. The found footage shooting was good. Dibakar is one promising director currently.MESSAGE: "You got to be sharp and smart or you become victim." VERDICT: "A must watch Bollywood film."" 
" An important Indian movie!!! Dibakar is a true genius!!","I haven't seen any of Dibakar Banarjee's previous films - "Oye Lucky Lucky Oye" & "Khosla Ka Khosla" yet. But I have heard good about them. I saw "LSD: Love, Sex Aur Dhokha" last night... and talking about the movie, I'd say, its truly an ingenious work. I've seen several POV (point of view) films such as .REC & Paranormal Activity. But this one.. this LSD... totally blew me away. Acting is surprisingly flawless, even though all the actors are newbies. Visuals are authentic as hell. Overall, an important Indian movie. Its disturbing too. A film that no one can ignore. Direction is... too damn GREAT!! Dibakar Banarjee is a true genius!! And I'm looking forward to watch his previous flicks.Watch it!! You will never regret!!! 9/10" 
" one of the most dark and disturbing movie in Indian cinema","well,despite being called a movie buff this was first ever time i watched first day first show of any movie and every effort was worth it,intrigued by the film title 'LSD' which is quite similar to the famous 60s drug LSD my first impression was the movie has something to do with drugs+love+sex+betrayal=youth though i was right the movie has everything sans the drugs.the whole movie is shot with hand-held or CCTV camera which gives it a very shaky and grungy look. Though the concept of movie being shot with hand-held camera is quite common in Hollywood and European cinema but these movies are either not available on Dvds or Indian viewers are just not interested in this form of movie-making.the movie has three different stories based on the same concept as the title suggests which later on intertwine towards the end..arguably this movie could well be called darkest movie of Indian cinema as first two of the 3 stories end up on a rather disturbing note.some of the scenes in the movie are brilliantly shot ..the brutally beating and chopping off the bodies of the two lovers with an Axe in the first story being one.the scene shook the spook out of me and as it seems is very much inspired from Gaspar Noe's 'irreversible's cylinder bashing scene.Actors in the movie are a bunch of nobodies..doing their first movie but no-one lets you down.Each one of the characters has done considerably well .director Dibakar Bannerjee as it seems is on a mission to break every cliché about how movies in India should be made or seen for that matter.After 'khosla K ghosla and 'oye lucky oye' LSD has cemented a berth for him in front row of the top directors.the most talented director after anurag kashyap i would say LSD might not make it big on box office it sure will have a cult following from those crooked minds who just want to lay their hands on everything that has something new to offer.i would give it an 8/10two thumbs way up for dibakar bannerjee..!!" 
" Who would have thought?","I watched this movie last night. It has been more than 20 hrs since then. The movie is still on my mind. I had to write something. I was completely blown away by the movie, and the Director, and the actors,and the camera work, and the writers, and the subject, and last but not the least, the complete outlook of the movie, which I reckon was biggest the USP of LSD. This is a 'First' in Hindi cinema. Mind you.This movie is about the harsh reality that exists in our society. There is no denying. There is no sugar coating it. There is no spoon feeding. There is no compromise. There is no pity. There is no make believe.It is in your face as it is. It's all real. The Actors have done a tremendous job. They have put those so called 'stars' to shame. I couldn't believe how natural they are, that It doesn't look acting at all. It seems you are watching real people through a camera. Dibakar Benerjee is 'THE' Director in contemporary Hindi Cinema among others. He has Director's attitude and aptitude. He knows what he is doing. and doesn't compromise on that. We need more like him to revolutionize the Hindi cinema. And I suppose it has already started in last 5 yrs or so. Amen. Let me tell you that LSD is not for everyone. So how do you tell if it's for you or not? Only you can decide it. Do yourself a favor. Go, watch it with an open mind." 
" LSD: Something new from our Hindi film industry","LSD 8.67( dividing by 3 this is what comes)Warning: Whoever is thinking of catching this movie in next week, forget it. Its gonna flop, not because its a bad movie but because its different. Not everyone would welcome its experience. Boring and bakwas would be two common terms about its review.About movie:- LSD or Love Sex aur Dhokha is a different movie experience, its kinda what they call piece-of-life movie genre, only here we have three incidents loosely connected. Just for the transition I guess.Three stories on three different human nature. First story is about love. Its the best. Good acting by the actors, sharp dialogs. This is a new level of violence, not gore but totally uses ur imagination, a shocking experience indeed. 10/10Second story is about Sex (which is absent): A bit slow, and stretched. This part is (I think) inspired by an MMS, I've seen that. The MMS is 6-7 yrs old and for the scene, had kind of similar background. Though stretched a bit, the acting is very good by all of them. The main gal kinda sucks at last sobbing scene. Her crying was not convincing, I guess dats why her face was not in focus. Good but looong story. 8/10Third story is about dhokha (fraud, betrayal). Good acting by the reporter guy and the gal. Not a good storyline or just a bit different. 8/10I say, the director did a very good job by getting out such a believable performance from all newcomers. Kudos to Dibakar Banerjee. Hope to see more works from him but with a good story in that case. I missed a start, middle, end here.I agree this is not a conventional movie but its just my opinion or wish." 
" An entertaining bold movie for Bollywood - But Bollywood still cheats!!","When Johnny Gaddar came out three years ago I had got a feeling that Indian Cinema is beginning to come of age. It was executing scripts which were never written before. Soon scripts like Oye Lucky Lucky Oye, Gulaal, Dev D, Khosla Ka Ghosla, Rock on!, Ishqiya, Taare Zameen Par, Black Friday etc had the cake of Indian Cinema nicely baked. Love, Sex Aur Dhokha is almost like an icing on that cake. You can safely say Indian Cinema has come of age and is never gonna look back to the Star system (read Khan System) and the Yash – Barjatya house of melodrama. Even if that will continue to sell more is irrespective.Still let me point out LSD is not an original its style and premise is copied from Adam Rifkins Look.Nevertheless, Whats the fuss ? Unfortunately I cannot reveal how LSD unrolls itself and I would suggest you go into the theater expecting nothing. Please do not read any reviews from any national dailies critics they just end up revealing just too much. So whats the bottom line: Dibakar Banerjee undertakes a biting satire study of the growing fascination of the Indian Middle class with the camera whether it is the MMS scandals, or the umpteen sting operations. Just Like OLLO he takes a heavy dig at the media, the mentality of the Indian middle class and even our fascination with sting operations and voyeur sex. The beauty of the film lies in the fact that it is actually shot in the first person point of view. Through your web cams, through your hand held, through your Security cams etc.It must have been difficult to shoot like that but it must have been even more difficult to get the emotions of the characters on screen through to the audience when there are no dramatic camera angles, no mid shot and no extreme close up to shoot. Dibakar however manages the perfect mix of these shots using in most cases a still camera. You feel heavily for his motley crew of characters as they feel happy or totally disoriented in the emotionally heavy (read shocking) script.That's where the most superlative cast I have ever seen comes on screen. At times you get the feeling Dibakar might have just let them play themselves and left his handy cam on. I don't remember any name but each of them are plain brilliant there's is just no other adjective to describe them.There is also the most perfect concoction of Humour, Romance, Mind Numbing Violence, Biting satire, strong emotion and sex in the script. To top it Dibakar just refuses to switch off the camera even when you are cringing for the visual to stop. Once the camera's REC button is switched on you better be ready to sit through everything!!And of course for Delhi lovers lets make no mistake, the typical Delhi characters which is trademark Dibakar with their "Behenchods" and "Oye Haan Jee Haan" are all back with the kick ass Bhangra scoreWatch out for the Typical Delhi Office store clerk in the Sex episode who goes with sentences like "Waah Waah Badi Nehru Market Lag Rahi Hai"Final Verdict : Go watch it and remember this is where Indian Cinema has finally caught up with its international counterparts.Special Mention for the Item number " I cant hold it any longer" . Just pay attention to the lyrics and the chorus which actually goes "FO FO FO FO"I would have given it a 10/10 but for the fact that it is copied from LOOK." 
" Dibakar proved himself...for the third time!!","LSD was a film not made with hyper-cryper budget...just a budget of 1.5 crore and a film which is not even tried by any other film-maker in bollywood..film has three stories...all of them developed well...and the violence in the first story...when those guys cut the couple in pieces..i was thinking that even QUENTIN Tarantino haven't showed such violence in his films...i was really feeling sad for them..and the way the whole movie goes is really outstanding..i knew that dibakar had the potential bt now after watching LSD...i am damn sure that he cannot give a flick which is not worth being called legendary..he has become my top most fav. director..the thngs he put up in his films is sumthing which we experience in our daily life...every small small things he keep in his mind while making filmz...5 years as a director..3 films at a gap of two years each..nd the most clean record anyone could have ever made in my opinion...khosla ka ghosla...9.0...oye lucky...8.9...and LSD..8.8..though i rated it 10 as i want it to get good stars on IMDb...dibakar rocks...a must watch film for everyone..and don't watch it with your girlfriend...would b better..!!8.8 / 10" 
" MY REVIEW: brave, disturbing, path breaking","Dibakar Banerjee after cult Khosla Ka Ghosla and smart Oye Lucky Lucky Oye tries something very different and he succeeds by a distance. The three stories narrated through cameras that are actually part of the story gives movie a authentic feel. The first story takes its own time to grab your attention and ends you making silent. Second story is best in narration, acting and impact. Third story is the weakest of the three but at the end when all three stories club together is seamless. The song at the end of the movie helps multiply the impact of the movie. The entire cast is new but very convincing.It is brave, disturbing, path breaking and changing face of bollywood cinema." 
" Most daring bollywood movie","This is perhaps the most daring bollywood movie I have ever seen. It is Dibakar Banerjee's finest work and one of the best Indian movies to come out in a decade.I was reluctant to see this movie at first. I was not aware at that time that it was directed by Dibakar Banerjee. I had only seen rushed promos and to me seemed it was one of those shaky cam movies, probably inspired by some foreign movie. But appearances can be deceiving, instead it turned out to be one of most original bollywood movies.Dibakar Banerjee has excelled himself. His latest venture is daring and more realistic than anything that has come out of bollywood.LSD is comprised of three stories which are somehow interconnected. The first story which is about Love pays a tribute to Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Rahul is a young student director. He is an ardent fan of DDLJ, and wants to be like his namesake Rahul, the protagonist in DDLJ.I don't want to reveal anything more. The movie is a treat and a very good mix of comedy and drama." 
" Excellent, film making at its best, big directors should consider this before making any crap love stories","The direction is so good that at any point in the movie you will not get bored. The three incidents are so correctly framed. The acting is good. It is not necessary to hire super stars to make a good picture even the new once can do better. It's up to the director and the storyline to make the difference. With this its surprising that these days low budget movies are doing great such as khosla ka ghosla, Phas gaya re obama, tere bin laden, etc. All bollywood big budget directors should concentrate on story and less on item numbers its the good story which will take them to Oscars not Sheila Ki jawani... lol. I recommend that you should watch this movie its different then any other crap love stories of Bollywood."
