" 404 - An amazing Experience","Watched Prawaal's 404 and the only thing that I can say is this is an "intelligent" movie. Our fears are created by us and we give them names and forms. In a brilliant piece of work Prawaal sends this message clear to all. We came out of the movie wanting more. Great job Prawaal, want to see more of you.Best wishes to your endeavor of giving Indian cinema a different taste every time you create a movie.The story is simple yet deep. Actors Imaad and Nishikant are brilliant and not to miss Tisca who plays her role to the T. What amazes me more is that how can such a simple script be dealt with so much class? Every moment in the movie is gripping" 
" Truly psyched my mind with twists and turns","Must say before you read this review, I prefer thrills of minds rather mare eye candy pleasures. I really liked 404 for its build up, twists and turns between person's psychology, academic experiment, ragging setup, bi-polar disorder, haunted room and ghost existence. 404 movie is brilliantly knit together with these different concepts with great timing and sequences. I also liked the shade of movie print and backdrop of college. Though, Rajvir acting was superb but Imad Shah's mischievous look and dimple took major limelight.English movies like Beautiful Mind, which falls in line, but in Indian context, this is one of few movies where director has taken courage to EXPERIMENT with such deep psychological concepts without casting biggies like Amitab, SRK or Ashwarya. Must watch movie!!!" 
" An interesting and engaging psychological thriller","Famous psychologist William James said "Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible". This line sums up 404, an intelligent psychological thriller that deals with a certain aspect of human psychology which explores the dilemma arising because of belief and disbelief resulting in many unsolved debate. This debate is the spinal cord of the narrative of 404 that brilliantly explores the psyche of both the sect of people. The films begins with a grainy video of a medical college focusing on a particular student who commits suicide in his room 404 and thus setting the mood for an edgy thriller but unlike loud desi horror films it comes across as a sensible story. Set in a medical college of high repute it explores the world of ragging and its side effect which results in psychological misbalance and drastic suicides. Abhimanyu (played by débutant Rajvvir Aurora) is a fresher stands against the seniors and dares to complain against them. A man with strong rational mind he chooses to stay in the forbidden "rumoured to be haunted" room 404. With help from rationalist medical psychology professor Aniruddha (brilliant acting by director Nishikant Kamath), Abhimanyu got the key to room number 404. Ragging went to the extent of psychological hammering by seniors led by Chris (played by Immaduddin Shah) which moulded Abhimanyu's mind to start hallucinating about Gaurav (the person who committed suicide in 404). With series of incidence Abhimanyu's rational soul is severely beaten as he starts experiencing the paranormal activities in the room. And there starts the fight between rational thinking and paranormal beliefs as Aniruddha sir becomes hell bound in saving a bright young mind like Abhimanyu getting drained down into irrationality. Following this the story is about the fight between rationalism and some undefined force which is beyond explanation of science. Whether Abhimanyu was really hallucinating or there is an existence of a/an atma (soul) in the room becomes the rest of the story in the second half. With two mediocre horror films in his kitty Prawal Raman take a complete u-turn by scripting the brilliant 404, something unseen in Indian cinema. Without playing it to the gallery the story moves at its own pace gradually involving and intoxicating the audience to the proceedings. The grainy starts to the blurred sequences there is a continuous swinging between belief and disbelief. Throughout the film director kept the debate open ended without supporting one extreme. Even camera (by Savita Singh) and lighting department helped to maintain balance between the two extremes. The jerks and sudden frame change sequences reflected the disturbances in the mind of Abhimanyu as well as Aniruddha sir and credit goes to Sarvesh Parab for the fine tuning. Prawal Raman has an eye for detailing and subtleties. Just after the opening credit, there was a sequence showing a TV channel airing a programme about the Nazi ruling by imposing fear which leads to forced belief and respect. In the similar manner the rational professor feels that the belief of god or evil are nothing but imposed fear which flows out of our subconscious mind thus our brain forcing the eyes to decipher. To keep the balance the costume and set designs are made with utmost detailing. The rational Abhimanyu is wearing a red string holy dhaga in hindu religion) in his hand. The posters in the room of Chris were all of spaghetti western which were in between the huge commercial films and low budget art-house ones. Every shot has an element of "somewhere in the middle" feeling attached to it. Raman scripted a non conclusive climax which has an element of belief and disbelief whereby two world of thinking collides with each having its own way of representation. Prawal Raman deserves a standing ovation for such an intelligent script and specially the camera angle in the climax scene which makes the scene non-conclusive, open to interpretation. Sameeruddin's back ground score with Singh's camera-work played the perfect duo in inducing an eerie feeling throughout the film. Coming to the acting department Nishikant Kamat (who made the critically acclaimed Mumbai Meri Jaan and Domvibli Fast) gives a stupendous performance as the famous careerist rational Professor Aniruddha who has a mysterious psychological past. He underplays his role beautifully in every sequence with special mention to the climax when he breaks down in fear and confusion when his own ideologies were challenged. Rajvvir Aurora makes a promising debut and is an actor to look for. The gradual transformation of a rationalist to believer in paranormal existence Rajvvir plays his role with striking acuteness. Tisca Chopra as Aniruddha's wife and a professor herself reflects elegance, charm and intelligence. She plays her role beautifully and even at this age she looks stunning without make-up and in regular dress. Satish Kaushik is always a great actor and here also excels in the role of a professor who is in dilemma about the existence of spirit. Imad Shah as Chris is a natural actor who plays the senior with a conscience perfectly. All the actors in the film underplay themselves brilliantly giving some believable performances. In 2009 a well crafted thriller "The stoneman murders" got released but went away unnoticed. I sincerely hope 404 gets its due credit as this is one of the rarest intelligent film on Indian celluloid that balances science and paranormal activities and breaks away from all the cliché of horror films that are made in India. 404 is a must watch for those who are craving for good cinema." 
" Intelligent Movie","404 turns out to be a very different experience . An intelligent concept,well thought of and researched work by Director Prawaal RamanTruly a mind game . Brilliant Acting by Imaad ,Nishikant and Tisca. Imaad is just too good as a senior.Nishikant's performance is brilliant and Tisca is excellent.Rajvir Arora is extremely good as this being his debut movie. The movie keeps you engaged all throughout .Prawaal Raman's direction is flawless. The movie makes your mind work all throughout.Very engaging.The climax turns out to be the best. Very unpredictable and you are made to think even after the movie is over. The film is a much watch for people who prefer something different and exciting cinema." 
" A Brave Attempt in today's competitive commercial cinema!!!","404 is a story of a medical college and its hostel where there are rumors that the room number 404 is haunted since there was a student named Gaurav who had committed suicide.With the new semester to start, the new students do follow the college lift followed by ragging.The story is gripping with a good screenplay. Screenplay is definitely enjoyable; however, the background score could have been softer overall like Ram Gopal Varma's Bhoot for fantastic impact to the story telling (which is a must for such movie).The characters are very well written and so is the entire storyline.The production value too is good but what I would like to appreciate more about the movie is the direction. Parwal Raman has done a good job but conceptualizing 404 and replicating its magic on silver screen.The movie is a psychopath story with a hint of twist in the end with all the Hallucinations taking complete charge of the character Abhimanyu (Rajvvir Aroraa).Rajvvir Aroraa has acted very well and does not seem to be a new comer. Nishikant Kamath too has done justice to his character of Professor Anirudh and his acting in the last 15 minutes of the movie is definitely worth appreciation. Tisca Chopra and Satish Kaushik too have done justice to their characters but what was most disappointing was Immad Shah (Nasseruddin Shah's son doing a cameo). I was seeing Nasser bhai's replication on screen.Overall a different story to enjoy and folks, you don't want to miss the climax !!!" 
" masterpiece from Indian cinema","saw 404.. most original script.. never saw such a brilliant film.. a film which is a philosophy in itself.. indeed a piece of art(subash k jha)it conveys a lot more than what appears.. it questions all in every way.. a true classic.. each view has a hidden meaning surfacing..and comparing it to other films is actually true horror..i pity the ignorance of the uneducated viewer.. i saw 1408.. a classic like 404 is way beyond compare with any world cinema..1408 is a regular horror film and other than the digital name nothing is common. 1408 is complete trash in front of 404..i web searched and not a single film has ever been made on the subject 404 has dealt with... therefor the most original.. i pity those who couldn't understand such classics .. hats off to raman.. and to nishikant kamat and tisca chopra..looking forward for more such work Raman.. and congratulations.. 404 is this years most acclaimed film.. 14 four star ratings out of 23.. not a single film this year is rated so highly,.. congrats..hats off to you raman" 
" Thought provoking movie"," The movie,404,is  thought provoking .It poses the question -- is a paranormal occurrence based on some scientific interrelationship between the deceased and the perceiver or is it just a state of mind that makes one believe so ? Both,the traditional ( the paranormal haunts the tormentor / the occupier of a particular locale as a revenge after death ) and the modern approach ( the perceiver's mind is conditioned by forces beyond his control to believe in the paranormal ) are dealt with.The end result is not conclusive.Both theories can co -exist. A fresher,Abhimanyu ( Rajvvir Aroraa) ,volunteers to occupy room number 404 in his medical institution's hostel,despite it being haunted.The room had remained locked for several months as a former student had committed suicide for being depressed.He had been under the trauma of the scars of vicious ragging by his seniors plus the tag of being a loser.Paranormal activity begins to haunt the new occupant.None believes the occupants version.The question arises how to help the occupant.A professor,Abhimanyu ( Nishikant Kamat) ,opines that the occupant boy is not a victim of the spell cast by the paranormal,but his own state of mind is conditioned by persistent ragging,he is made to believe what others make him believe. The climax remains inconclusive though. On what counts does 404 get a thumbs up? Majority of spooky movies have concentrated on the bhoot-pret kinda approach to give a rationale and create a scare,404 focuses on the modern state of mind approach of the rationalists.The movie is engaging through out.Uniformly good and realistic performances appear on the screen.Nishikant Kamat needs a special mention.This reviewer kept on wondering why the authorities were unable to check ragging despite the law and supreme court's ruling against the barbarity ? The mystery gets revealed in the climax.The professor himself was experimenting on Abhimanyu through a gang of willing senior students who were set up to create fear in the junior to test his hypothesis for a thesis.It's a different matter  that the professor himself had been under the spell of her deceased mother.The professor 's assertion that only the insecure believe in God and ghosts is debatable.His belief that the Facebook is a trap to subjugate the thoughts of subjects for commercial purposes is also debatable.At least the beliefs make us give it a thought.404 amply proves that it's possible to deliver good cinema with low budgets and it requires no stars and nach- gaana of the big budget kind.In fact it uneraths new talent. Where does 404 get a thumbs down? The experimentations on the uninitiated in institutions of higher learning can lead to permanent damage on the subjects.The gang of raggers never look like students,being overgrown,they look more of sidekicks of a gangsters than students.The scare element is missing. All in all 404 is a bold and a different attempt on the paranormal genre of films.The movie is destined for critical acclaim." 
" The idea will haunt you.","Kudos to the director, writer and actor for this movie. I was not sure of watching this movie after watching the trailer, but picked the movie with a friend at half and watched it from the beginning. Well, he was scared for sure. It was not the special effects or the scary faces but the blend of idea that the characters were discussing and the perfectly timed appearances of events in room no. 404.Satish Kaushik is himself in the movie, his character is always on the safe side of the discussion and he proves it. Tisca Chopra was good and Immad shah could do better than this, after his Dil Dosti etc. Nishikant Kamat delivers a good performance and Rajvvir Arora's character has to be poker face at times but he overdid it.If you are thinking its based on college ragging, some copied or failed implementation of a great idea, you are wrong. To enjoy the movie it is necessary to be confused than to be sure about the existence of paranormal/what happens after death. The scene just before the curtain drops can haunt you for days." 
" Hat's off for such a brave and successful experiment","Firstly I want to give a standing applaud for the brave and bold experiment in Boolywood by Mr. Director "Praval Raman". Mostly the fate of these movies are pre judged and decided in our country, same happened with 404 too. Not many movie enthusiast even know about this. What a pity! The movie is for every sincere movie lover, for all the Hollybood maniacs who claim Indian film industry having no sense, generates no meaningful movie.The movie is based on the Psyche of human mind, its vulnerability to so called unexisting objects and ghosts. The movie is plotted in a medical college where freshers are being ragged and a boy named Abhimanyu, kinda stand against it. Also he insists his warden and teacher (Satish Kaushik) to allot him room no. 404 where a student died 3 yrs ago and a rumor was in the air about Ghosts and spirits in the room. In the parallel Prof. Anirudh is immensely impressed with Abhimanyu and working on a thesis on Bipolar Disorder. As movie gradually picks the pace, a series of events unturns and enters a slightly dark mode. Last 15-20 minutes are nail biting as the mystery unfolds.As a psyche senior Imad Shah and his friends did a decent job. None of the actors is a biggie yet has done a full justice to their characters. Background score is commendable and is fullon successful in creating the aroma of mystery, fear and suspense. Few scenes of ragging like one in the room with red light in the room is surprisingly esthetically shot. Also Ranjan deserves full points in creating the environment of a college, sketching each character with solidity.Hats off to him for such a brave experiment. Kudos :)" 
" 2011's Most Under-Rated Movie. ♦ 61%","I don't care if it references "The Beautiful Mind" or "1408," because 404 is one example that Bollywood is treading somewhere good.The cast performance is scintillating, so is the camera work. But I am disappointed with the editing & screenplay. The latter could've been more polished when telling a tale involving psychology & thrills. Talking about spirits & hallucinations, the plot is pure suspense till the last minute. With supports from huge social causes & rendering the actual situation of newbies in medicine colleges, drives the movie as a great entertainer.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended due to its absolute story-telling & spine- chilling climax. You might want to watch the ending twice to completely understand what the writers intend. Bravo!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity/Nudity/Sex: No | Vulgarity: Very Mild | Smoking/Alcohol/Drugs: Mediocre | Violence: Mediocre | Gore: No | Porn: No" 
" A fine one time watch experimental movie, but only for a tiny section of viewers.","The welcome trend of new concept based experimental movies continues with "404" directed by Prawaal Raman of 'Darna Mana Hai', 'Darna Zaroori Hai' and 'Gayab' fame. Striking back with a similar kind of movie based on an abnormal subject, the director takes one step ahead of his previous works since 404 is not the usual, over the top ghost movie made in the typical Indian horror style. In fact this is neither a complete horror movie nor an exciting suspense thriller capable of bringing the viewer on to the edge of his seat.In real terms, 404 is an intelligent move, no doubt, which is also both directed and acted pretty well. But the problem is that the film keeps on hanging between the different genres of horror, thriller and suspense/mystery movies and in the end fails to satisfy any particular section of viewers on the whole. Another problem from the business point of view is that there are not many takers of such thoughtful, slow paced, logical type of movies which don't have much to offer to the audiences in the name of entertainment.Without giving you the real mystery plot of the film, I would only like to reveal that it's a script largely talking about Ragging in a Medical College and its cruel consequences. The basic plot revolves around a suicide committed by a student of the college in the past after being brutally ragged by his seniors. The room where he had committed the suicide has the number 404 and from that day onwards it has been kept locked, declared as Haunted. A new student asks special permission to stay in that room, which in turn starts the real game in the movie involving all its lead characters.But unfortunately the outcome on the screen is not that interesting as it may seem to be after reading the plot given above. The twists and turns do shake you a bit at regular intervals but the pace is extremely slow and the interesting things actually happen only towards the climax. As a result, at times the film becomes quite heavy and intolerable. In other words it can appeal to only a tiny section of the viewers who are used to seeing such kind of World Cinema, particularly the movies made around some psycho characters.Another big flaw of the script is that it is not at all possible to continue such kind of secret and controversial projects within the campus by a hugely famous renowned, responsible professor and that too without the knowledge and consent of the College's Dean. Further, I found one particular scene of the film completely unacceptable where the Professor proves his theory by using his living medium in front of a large audience. The scene felt like a silly psychic show where a living human person was being used as a lab instrument in front of all learned and well experienced achievers of their fields, showing no objection to such insane practice.But coming to the better things in the movie, it has some superlative performances by both Nishikant Kamat as the professor and Rajvvir Aroraa as his fresh student. Where Rajvvir impresses you with his silent and expressive language, Nishikant bowls you over with his powerful portrayal of a tough character, particularly in his last scene of the movie. And those who may not know, he is same director who gave us films such as Dombivli Fast and Mumbai Meri Jaan. In fact with this performance he readily proves that he knows the medium much better than many more in the field.Imaad Shah is eye catching and cool. But I wonder why he chose to give music and lyrics in a project which is not going to have any of his songs in the film itself. He is a gifted musician and as a logical start, should have given music in a film which at least had few of his own songs in the movie. Anyway as an actor he has got great potential and he should positively do some regular work in the industry suiting his unique personality. Tisca Chopra gives another fabulous performance as usual. But Satish Kaushik has nothing new to offer in his comic type of role. The remaining cast is fine but I really didn't find the seniors shown in the movie actually looking like the seniors of a medical college. The film has been shot on a lower format but still the cinematography is great, with good use of lighting, matching the horror cum suspense theme of the movie.But in all, it's not a film which would get an appreciation from majority of its viewers. It's only for the people who are used to such kind of thoughtful and intellectual movies. So go for it, only if you consider yourself one of them." 
" Nothing Short of Brilliant","I can't see how this movie deserves anything less than 10 points.I am a student of psychology but I do think this movie is a must watch for every type of viewer. The film is very well directed, with as much realism as possible. It is well paced to build the feel of the film and also avoids any bollywood drama and songs. The acting matches the excellence of the film. It excels in the technical department as well.The best part is the climax, where the unexpected revelation takes place. It is very well explained. The protagonist is also aptly named as Abhimanyu, who knows how to get into a crisis, but not how to get out of it. From a psychological perspective, it is an experience to watch the psyche of both a zealous professor and an abused student.A cannot-miss, this one is." 
" its different and it works...amazing...you will never have been seen such Hindi movie","404 is a suspense thriller with a twist in the end that blows your mind. The highpoint of the film lies in the fact that it explores paranormal activity without abandoning science and rationality. And that indeed is a rare achievement.Following a linear structure, the narrative stays focused right through.The film is a must watch for all 'thriller' fans. And also horror buffs! Don't miss it. And yet "404" is one of the most terrifying movie experiences in recent times.Go for 404 with a bottle of patience. It runs for so long that you could start hallucinating whether the movie is real." 
" fresh concept ...Average film.. a bit long and slow...","I wasn't even aware that this movie is released and saw it two years after it was released. I was very excited to watch this movie after reading some good reviews. The start of the movie looked promising. The concept is very fresh. The acting of the new faces was also good. But the pace of the movie is very slow. Most of the times you get bored and feel like leaving it. The twist at the end was good. But overall the movie looked like an experiment from its makers. The horror scenes in the movie were not really horror.But its OK if they did not want to make a horror movie. The Presmises of college is too dull it looks like only a few students are studying there and it doesn't even a college. Overall the movie was a very fresh concept in Indian cinema but Its not very entertaining." 
" If u are looking for a nobrainer, look elsewhere...","In every race there is always a dark horse; a dark horse who nobody knows; a dark horse on whom all the odds are stacked against; a dark horse who nobody expects to win.So this Friday when i was unable to pick a movie to watch, i decided to put all bets on one such dark horse- "404..."I knew nothing bout this movie, hadn't even seen the trailers, not even the posters..It was a long shot that paid off and like a true underdog it came out triumphant completely satisfying all my expectations cos believe me i had gone in with none...The name "404 - Error not found" is a rather misleading name for a movie that explores the paranormal and the unexplainable without abandoning rationality of science.This movie is surely a milestone in the history of Hindi Cinema for it has successfully tackled the sensitive issue of spirits of the dead with the backdrop of ragging in a medical college campus using the torch of scientific reasoning. Although this movies is not a horror movie but the idea of the presence of a spirit with unfinished business coupled with some spooky scenes does send a chill down your spine.The movie is about how a fresher enters the college with his heart full of dreams and aspirations of becoming the best of the lot.Rajvir Arora plays Abhimanyu the fresher to perfection.The movie moves on with basic plot being the nuisance that is ragging, in a medical college. The ragging reaches a new low when one of the seniors, Chris ( played by Imaad Shah) forces Abhimanyu to do in-depth research bout a student who had committed suicide in the infamous room 404 in which Abhimanyu later moves in to prove that no such thing exists with the faith and support of his psychiatrist professor played excellently by Nishikanth Kamath.Wat happens next is for you to find out cos i absolutely don't wanna give out any spoilers..What i will say is that this is one of the movies in which after every 3rd scene i tried to predict whats gonna happen next and failed miserably.I mean the movie had a firm grip on me and i was sitting on the edge of my seat trying to just figure out what the hells gonna happen next and finally when it climaxed I knew the juice was totally worth the squeeze!! AS I SEE IT in an era where intelligent cinema is indeed a rarity, Prawaal Raman is standing with a beacon of hope; hope that credits the audience with an IQ apart from the so called and over hyped EQ.Imaad Shah plays the laid back and carefree senior who tops every class with élan.Nishikanth Kamath is totally believable as the psychiatrist professor.Tisca Chopra looks cute as usual.The cinematography needs to be applauded for it spooked without gimmicks of sound effects and 3D. It is because of the applaud worthy performances and the scintillating and riveting direction that has forced me to keep my critical analysis of which i am so full of to myself and credit this movie with respect which it deserves. Bottom line - if u are looking for a nobrainer, look elsewhere..." 
" Average thriller but not as great as made out here.","There are certain elements and moments here which are interesting. The movie deals with a student moving into Room 404 in a hostel which had a student commit suicide in the past. And then starting to have hallucinations about seeing the student who died, talking to him and so forth.The movie has its moments but at points is a very tedious watch due to terrible acting at places. The Professor is a major culprit in this area giving away to histrionics at various places. Surprisingly, many posters here seem to rate this as a great performance. And the superfluous/ridiculous treatment of bipolar disorder is another jarring reason.The movie premise has promise though and keeps you involved at places. Hence a 6/10. But needs a lot of patience to sit through to get to see those elements."
