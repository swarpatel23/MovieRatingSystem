" Decayed","This film started in 1999 and released in 2003 The film had a story which got outdated since 1980's and worst is the executionThe film's delay too shows throughout, suddenly Ajay's hairstyle changes from the fringe of early 2000 to the later brown hair The film's handling seems so hackeyened that you can't watch it even onceDirection by Deepak Bahry is bad Music is badAmongst actors Ajay looks out of place in such a film, Amisha irritates Pooja Bhatra is just there Guslhan grover is routine Sadashiv Amrapurkar is okay" 
" Thought It was a good watch and","was i wrong or what? i cant believe i spent money on this rental! anyway, Ajay devgan's performance is always good but his role looked forced. amisha Patel looks confused at times. Ajay's role looks forced and out of place. this movie's formula might have worked two decades ago with Ajay (parwana) as a thief but who steals for the unfortunate. the movie includes a terrorist link that parwana gets sucked into. the love story between Ajay and amisha looked convenient. the only good thing about it is the confrontations/scenes between Ajay and gulshan grover who plays a bad cop. the music is not even good! the story and dialogue are dull and repetitive. i think viewers are tired of seeing a terrorist plot and the good thief reminded me of robin hood!!"
