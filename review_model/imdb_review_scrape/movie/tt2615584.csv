" Great fun ride!!","Was pleasantly surprised as to how enjoyable the movie really was!! Total paisa vasool, fun and wholesome Bollywood flick after a long time. It is not sleazy like Grand Masti or mindless like Chenni Express!!Raj Kumar Santoshi has given us another timeless classic comedy after my favorite 'Andaz Apna Apna!! Leads are good - I mean Shahid annoys and Ilena looks pretty!Songs are fun, especially the Atif Aslam track and the 'aghal bhaghal' number. Dialogues and scenes LOL - without being cheap! Perfect night out movie without your thinking hats on!!" 
" If Rajkumar Santoshi Doesn't Make a Great Film He at Least Makes a Decent Film","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.1/5 starsPartly funny, somewhat emotional, intermittent witty dialogues, a couple of peppy songs, and sporadically wonderful scenes. Therein lies the inherent problem of "Phata Poster Nikla Hero" - it might entertain you throughout, but it never comes together as a wholly cohesive unit. Though it is better than most other mediocre Bollywood films this year, it never comes close to scaling the heights of Mr. Santoshi's erstwhile laugh riots - "Andaz Apna Apna" and "Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani".Lastly a word must be put in about Shahid Kapoor's, who surely surprises many with his performance. He's in full flow and in complete control of his act, displaying his entire range from comedy, to emotions, to conventional Bollywood hero. After ages, he successfully carries an entire film on his shoulders, albeit with some help from Padmini Kolhapure (great to see her talent on display after so long), Darshan Zariwala, Sanjay Mishra, Saurabh Shukla, and Zakir Hussain. Ileana D'cruz is a total let-down." 
" Full-On Time-Pass!","Rajkumar Santoshi's 'Phata Poster Nikla Hero' is an entertaining, funny & action-packed film, that also offers energetic music & a terrific performance by its leading man Shahid Kapoor.'Phata Poster Nikla Hero' Synopsis: An aspiring actor is mistaken for a super cop. Chaos follows. 'Phata Poster Nikla Hero' has an action-packed & hilarious first-hour, the humor is perfect, the action is superb & Shahid's performance keeps you glued on the screen. The Second-Hour gets a bit dragging, especially in the penultimate portions & even the suspense of the main villain, is not effective enough. The finale is over-the-top, but entertaining nonetheless. Santoshi's Screenplay, laced with humor & action works big time in the first-hour, but a shorter & crisper second-hour was needed. Though never boring, the pace does dip in the second-hour, which acts as its only deterrent. A special mention for the funny dialogue, again written by Santoshi himself. Santoshi's Direction is well-done. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design are good. Action-Sequences are superb. Music by Pritam is energetic.Performance-Wise: Shahid is terrific from start to end. He enacts the comic, emotional as well as the action-sequences faultlessly. This is his best performance since Kaminey. Ileana D'Cruz does a decent job. Its great to see veteran actress Padmini Kolhapure after a hiatus. She's excellent. Darshan Jariwala scores. Sanjay Mishra's impeccable comic timing continues to mesmerize. Saurabh Shukla & Zakhir Hussain are extremely funny as the baddies. Mukesh Tiwari does well, as always. Tinnu Anand is fair. Nargis Fakhri sizzles in an item number, while Salman Khan has a scene-stealing cameo. On the whole, 'Phata Poster Nikla Hero' emerges a Winner, despite its minuses. Go, have fun!" 
" Enjoyable","Phata Poster Nikala Hero is you can say comeback movie for Shahid Kapoor.It has everything dance comedy romance emotions but the pace of the movie is slow and became boring for some kind of audience.Shahid has done brilliant job as action hero and as romantic charming boy.Ileana's performance was good.In some point she has over reacted.Songs were fabulous especially DHATING NAACH,MAIN RANG SARBATON KA & TU MERE AGAL BAGAL HAIN.1st half is totally comedy time pass but there are so many twists in 2nd half.Movie's length is long and pace is little slow.Because this is Rajkumar Santoshi's film definitely there will be more drama and emotions.Shahid Kapoor is the only reason to watch this movie.He is looking stunning and charming in every song.Salman Khan's cameo is highlight of the movie.You will enjoy this scene very much just like in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani.Overall,watch this movie to enjoy your 2:30 hrs." 
" Family Entertainer","In an era when Bollywood movies are becoming bolder with new treatment and storyline and are getting plethora of kudos for it ,it is actually quite a risky business to follow the old school way of movie making.Yes you do get all the clichéd characters,songs out of sequence,over the top acting and intermixing of a few Bollywood plots but what stands out for the movie at least for the first part is that it has got its soul in the right place.In contemporary times the plot of a movie gets praised just for showing a couple of intimate scenes (and promoted as pathbreaking) and live in relationships this movie tries what others have forgotten,that is a movie which you could watch with your entire family without being embarrassed .Talking about the movie the first half is better than the second which looses what already was a thin plot.Still the movie will make you laugh(the guffaws of audience in the cinema hall at least proves so).Overall the movie stands on the thin line of passable vs watchable,personally born in late 80's having grown up watching films with my family throughout I found the movie a nice refresher.If you have free time go out with your family and enjoy this movie.6+1 ..extra one for being a clean family entertainer (pathbreaking for contemporary times i guess!!!)" 
" A light entertainer","In the contemporary bollywood, there are three ways to make a movie hit: sex,cast or making a masala flick. This movie has last two alluded elements. It is funny and emotional. As is being said that it is a tribute to two of bollywood's blockbusters DON and MUNNA BHAI M.B.B.S, you'll find half of the half part and half of the last part of the movie as intermingling of said movies. You'll also find that as in funny movies of Rajkumar Santoshi the element of comic fighting is prevalent through out the movie. Story: As I told that this story is intermixing of two movies. Despite of copying,film has got some genuine ideas and stuff. 5/10 I will award to the story.Acting: Shahid kapoor has once again proved that no doubt he's a verstile actor and can justify every role given to him. Funny expressions can make you laugh even you may fall from your seats and said expressions can make you cry. I'll give 8/10 to the acting." 
" Time pass, entertainer for Shahid's fan","Its time pass movie, which has love, mother sentiment,action,comedy and some stunts, we can call it as family entertainment. But don't go to movie with lots of expectation,For just passing time you can watch this movie in cinema hall. Movie only depends on Shahid acting, so full time enjoyment for Shahids fan, Ileaya don't have a better role in this movie, she comes in few seen just like a name sake heroine, Comedy villains and police, those are all having foolish mindset. Overall once watchable only if you have free time and less expectation on the movie." 
" Typical Bollywood time pass movie","Rajkumar Santoshi tries another Andaz Apna Apna, of course he couldn't, but the film is still alright. Not a great movie, not even good enough if you expect the talent of Santoshi to shine through, but as a movie, it entertains.And is that not what a movie is supposed to do? The songs are good, actors are okay, sometimes to add to the comics, there is some ham which probably could have been trimmed. Comedy, Romance, Item song, Maa-Beta, Baap-beta, good cop bad cop, everything is there as Shahid Kapoor says in the movie. There is a guest appearance by Salman Khan also. Should you pay to watch the movie? Maybe not, you wont definitely wont lose your money, the songs itself are worth it, but then you wont miss it if you don't see it and anyway it will be in cable in a few weeks." 
" An average comedy flick with some irregular but good funny sequences.","Continuing from where he left four years back in AJAB PREM KI GHAZAB KAHANI,writer-director Raj Kumar Santoshi strikes again with another of his slapstick comedy called PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO wherein we have Shahid Kapoor trying almost similar things as played by Ranbir Kapoor in the 2009 hit. Though in his latest comedy, Santoshi stresses a lot more on the emotional factor and mother-son relationship right from the first frame to the last. Still the good thing is that the film does have some fun filled comic moments reminding you of Santoshi's cult comedy ANDAZ APNA APNA and thus for me its much better than APKGK which I couldn't enjoy a lot, to be honest. In reality APKGK got a huge boost due to its big star-cast and hit melodious music missing in PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO. But the truth is that you will find more traces of that good old Santoshi of AAA in this Shahid-Ileana starrer (not relying on any Chaplin like sequences) as compared to director's 2009 blockbuster, quite frankly.Having said that, the other dark side of the coin remains that PPNH does have an avoidable list of hiccups associated with its plot & story progression, which are sure going to restrict its box office results, as it seems. The film begins exactly like a typical Bollywood family drama of the 80s and then has a song in store too before the comedy takes it over from the front. The narration takes time to set the mood in but once it comes into the flow, you have a pretty good first half with many hilarious scenes and witty dialogues to enjoy on the lines of ANZAZ APNA APNA. The opening 30 minutes also have a surprise sequence with SALMAN KHAN wherein he too mentions AAA Part 2 being made by Santoshi with Aamir Khan in a sarcastic tone. Together the entire cast puts up a good show in few sequences and one overall enjoys the first half ignoring its initial weak moments and the deliberate songs.Post intermission, as the viewers are ready to enjoy it more, surprisingly the film goes into a different mode altogether and drops badly. The long emotional & slightly absurd insertions simply ruin the enjoyable build up of its first half and one starts losing patience waiting for its promised comic moments for long. After a while it does strike back, but is not able to generate the similar kind of impact as made in its initial hour, till the climax. The villain's additional plot of Operation White Elephant simply falls flat and a few songs (in shorter versions) are thrown in just like that followed by a clumsy end (treating the Police real bad) which lacks the solid punch required in such comic scripts.Musically PPNH has one enjoyable track "Tu Mere Agal Bagal Hai", which is not only melodiously composed (Pritam) and well sung (Mika) but also has a dazzling choreography well adapted by Shahid. Plus I also liked "Main Rang Sharbaton Ka" while watching it on the screen featuring the stunning Ileana. Besides both background score and cinematography enhance the comedy sequences fairly as required. In the performance section, it's a Shahid Kapoor film all the way and the actor tries almost everything in his act quite convincingly. Shahid shows variety in his act but unfortunately the script plays the spoil sport here particularly in the second half. Ileana in her second film post BARFI plays it well but doesn't get any strong role to present her acting skills. It was really a treat to watch Padmini Kolhapure in a major, long length role after a long time. Providing the much needed comic support, Sanjay Mishra, Saurab Shukla, Darshan Jariwala and Zakir Hussain are truly superb with their admirable timing. Mukesh Tiwari sincerely tries hard to put up a good show as the villain but Nargis Fakhri is not up to the mark in her song-dance cameo. Putting it together, the biggest merit of PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO is its clean, enjoyable comedy (away from sex and double meaning stuff), along with many funny, entertaining dialogues which instantly reminds you of the director's first comic movie released almost two decades back. Yes, the film cannot be termed as a great entertainer or a perfect comedy due to its many drawbacks mostly visible post intermission. Yet I would like to rate it much more than Santoshi's last APKGK for the only reason that it did reach quite close to the unique ANDAZ APNA APNA in its few scenes thankfully.Now coming to the INSPIRATION Section of the review, 1. The title of the film is taken from a dialogue of HERO HIRALAL (1988) in which Naseeruddin Shah comes out tearing a film's poster and says the same words.2. The very first scene of the film dealing with a self confessed traffic challaan is straight out of FERRARI KI SAWAARI (2012) wherein Sharman Joshi does the same act as done by Padmini Kolhapure.3. Most importantly (as also confessed in a dialogue too), the whole story idea of PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO has been inspired from MUNNA BHAI MBBS with the theme of Doctor being replaced by an Inspector. To elaborate it further, as seen in Munna Bhai film, here the hero's mother thinks that her son has become an Inspector and she is coming to visit him in the town. Knowing this, the hero becomes a fake inspector and all his friends play different roles of a hawaldaar, a social worker and more to support the inspector's act.Anyway, if you loved watching AJAB PREM KI GHAZAB KAHANI a lot, then you are sure going to enjoy PHATA POSTER NIKHLA HERO too as a one-time watch, particularly for all its entertaining funny moments in the first half. So just keep that yardstick in mind and make your own decision for the coming weekend." 
" Manages To Entertain As The Fuggy Story Collapses. ♦ 45%","It showers few newness & respite into our palate after few let-downs in 2013. The man who gave us Ajab Prem Ki... has made a comeback but fails to understand that same formula does not work all the time.Shahid Kapoor has probably lost it, with no signature to him at all. His performance is fine for the plot which talks about a mother-son relationship and all the drama surrounding to her dreams of seeing her son as a policeman & some underworld mystery which later turns into tomfoolery. Somewhere or the other, a feeling that the scene you just watched has happened before may trouble you, but I promise it ain't deja vu. I feel sorry for Illeana D'Cruz playing the role of a side-character who has very little screen space, provided the songs are excluded. Padmini Kolhapure is good, so are the other supporting cast.Coupled with inventive writing & terrible character depth, it tries to indulge its audience, referring hell of a lot of Bollywood cult classics & the actors who played in them. A cameo by a popular B-town actor adds humor to it. Not to mention, the humor is terrific throughout, but fails if we consider the slapstick involved (mostly through Shahid's) & ask our brains to indulge. A tad melodramatic towards the end, PPNH is an average watch with your friends & family which is able to quench your movie thirst if long running time, sentimental drama and 5 songs (incl. one item number) doesn't affect your watch..BOTTOM LINE: Fairly recommended 'cause it manages to stand up and wave, then tumbles down into a limbo. Easily forgettable.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity/Vulgarity/Nudity/Sex/Alcohol/Smoking: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Very Mild | Porn: No" 
" Phata Poster Nikla Torture","The movie is below average.There is no story in the movie.the first of the movie is worst and can't be watched but the second is better than the previous half.The comedy in the second half is good but still not good enough to make the movie interesting .The acting of shahid kapoor and ilena is not up to the mark and the songs in the movie are good.The songs sung by Atif aslam are good and the very well shot.The genre is comedy but the comedy won't make you laugh. The pros of the movie are only comedy scenes in the second half and the rest are cons of the movie.The story did not have enough content and better to avoid the movie rather than watching the movie at least once." 
" An ordinary and mediocre struggle – A cinematic atrocity","Rajkumar Santoshi is trying hard to recreate the magic of the cult comedy 'Andaz Apna Apna (1994)', he attempted it with 'Ajab Prem Ki Gazab Kahani (2009)' but it was not even close to it i.e. beyond comparison. He now approaches with "Phata Poster Nikhla Hero" which is not even close to 'Ajab Prem Ki Gazab Kahani'. 'Andaz Apna Apna (1994)' was released in 90s, receptivity and ingenuity have been changed entirely since then and we are in the phase of emerging Indian Cinema. Audiences require some commonsensical and decent screenplays because reiteration is not serving any purpose. Rajkumar Santoshi is a veteran, active since 'Ghayal (1990)', it is really a high time to understand the level of cinema and discard all the gimmicks. I am not able to understand the motivation behind making such films, what really drove the producers and the director? 'Phata Poster Nikhla Hero' about Savitri (Padmini Kolhapure), a righteous mother, who dreams to make his son Vishwas (Shahid Kapoor) an honest police officer. Vishwas in contrast dreams to become an actor. One fine day Vishwas gets a training call from Mumbai; this gives him a chance to pursue his acting career. In the process Vishwas is inadvertently taken as police officer, by Kajal (Ileana D'Cruz) a reporter. Everyone starts to believe that he is a cop and it starts the misunderstandings and comedy of errors.The screenplay revolves around a wire thin plot, which is jarringly uneven. It heavily relies upon the happenings which is really unexciting. It includes many precipitous scenes, forced song sequences, abrupt love track and horrendous background score.For at least 15 minutes it runs on the right track but abruptly goes off the track and goes into oblivion. You will witness forcefully plotted situations one after other, it really drags the story and becomes monotonous.It lacks on the technical part too, the fight scenes are atrociously choreographed, editing is totally wretched, all the colors have been used by the cinematographer and every scene seems like a rainbow on the screen. The motif behind these colorful scenes is really unknown; maybe they wanted to create a colorful comedy which ultimately is flat and tiresome.Pritam's music has become a chart-buster, some tracks like 'Tu mere agal bagal', 'Dhating dance' and 'Main rang sharbaton ka' are playing in every channel and corner. But these songs are placed abruptly and don't run with the story. The best way to enjoy these songs, (for the lovers of 'Phata Poster Nikhla Hero's tracks) is to watch these only on the music channels; you will really appreciate Shahid's moves.There is an array of the contemporary actors in the movie; in one word all of them are wasted. Shahid Kapoor shows his comical timings and strength in some parts but mostly he over-acted, his dance numbers are an exception though.Ileana D'Cruz was a miscast, she even does not look glamorous and her dialog delivery is terrible. Dharshan Jariwala, Saurabh Shukla, Sanjay Mishra, Zakir Hussain and Padmini Kolhapure have put great efforts but it could not save the film because of lack of punches and comical timings.In a nutshell, it is really an insult to the comedy genre and Santoshi's own 'Andaz Apna Apna'. If the crew does not have the proper vision of creation, they should stop making such wastes. Such movies increase the bandwidth of idiot-ism and waste of money by all means.4.6/10" 
" Utter nonsense",""Phata Poster Nikhla Hero" tells the story of a young man who moves to the big city in order to become a film star, is casted for the role of a police officer and soon finds himself trapped in a big lie.The movie is very cheap comedy, without a solid plot or huge acting. It is entertaining and doesn't really get all too boring, even though I could have done without the dance performances that didn't always fully match the content. You can surely like the film for its trash factor but that doesn't change the fact that it tends to leave you speechless through a series of very odd choices and sideplots.All in all I could have done without this film. If you feel like it and search for something to switch off your mind, this can be fun. Otherwise it just remains a bad film." 
" An average comedy film! One extra star only for the songs!","Like his earlier comedies, which include the cult classic Andaz Apna Apna, Santoshi aims to create a zany and wacky tone. In places, this film is inspired. But often, it's just tired. But comedy like this needs to be relentlessly inventive and high-energy. He bungs in emotions that the film hasn't earned. Post-interval, the vigor deflates considerably. But none of it can make up for the lack of laughs. Phata Poster Nikhla Hero is intermittently entertaining. If you are undemanding or a Shahid Kapoor fan, you might enjoy it. But don't expect much from it. It doesn't delivers anything new! Its all familiar which we have seen in other comedies that we are used to now! I was going for 6 out of 10 but added 1 extra star for the songs!" 
" average story,average comedy,average Indian action,OK music_watchable for an average day","watched PHATA POSTER NIKLA HERO ..no one have big expectations from a film like this..cause of its_f**k your logic n enjoy the show_tendency..besides that these film also happens to average in their plot,cinematography, screenplay n other big words(for them)...BUT the power source for films like these are their cast(with witty dialogues)& their feet thumping music ..& this movie has that..it was its cast(every actor) n their performances which kept you watching this nearly 3hours long flick with highly predictable story & "what?" dialogues of its lead actors..with its OK songs...Now its a light film to lighten up your mood in a light/regular day...its neither good nor bad BUT it'll left you entertain..if you are not looking for logic..least its better than any double meaning sh!t you can't watch with your family_WATCHABLE_ if you just want to giggle at everything" 
" Phata Poster Nikla Shahid??? Where is the hero bhai...","Phata Poster Nikla Hero is a masla entertainer,film has a right dose of comedy,action,and emotions.1st half is racy and fun,but 2nd half though good gets tedious and boring a bit.PPNH is not a film were a great story is needed,a tale of a mother wanting her son to be cop but he wants to be a actor+add clichés and craziness and this is the crux of the film.Shahid Kapoor is the film,he portrays the wacky/macho hero role well,he is first rate.Ilena D'Cruz looks beautiful and her job is done...Out of the supporting cast Sanjay Mishra,saurabh shukla,Darshan Jariwal,and Zakir Hussain are all hilarious and in top form!!! Dir Rajkumar Santoshi tries hard to recreate the APKGK and AAA magic in PPNH but he fails, though a good film not up to he is own standards.Overall a racy,fun 1st half,great comedy,good acting by Shahid Kapoor and supporting cast make the film a decent watch. Watch if you want a stress buster film and don't mind enjoying the movie while leaving your brain at home. Its film made for the Mass audience who love there clichéd masla entertainers!!!"
