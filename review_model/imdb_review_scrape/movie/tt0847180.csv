" Once again a shameful copy-paste act from Bollywood taking it all from CRIME SPREE (2003).","What is done with the answer sheet, which is found to be all copied from another intelligent person's paper without his knowledge? Either the student is called and asked his explanation for the mischief done or his paper straight away gets disqualified from the exams. So here I choose the second option of not finding this movie worthy enough of writing any detailed review since it simply makes no contribution of its own in the cinematic process and just remains a carbon copy of CRIME SPREE released in 2003.Not really directed by Rajnish Raj Thakur in actual terms, his LOOT is scene to scene lifted from the French/English movie right from its first sequence of robbery in the dark till its climax. But despite of being a replica kind of attempt, with everything ready in the plate (read DVD) to follow, the director fails to capture the comic spirit of the Original, turning it into a completely lifeless venture in all. However there is one unique point here regarding the COPIED status of LOOT.Bollywood is known for imitating from the West as a normal routine, but here the makers not only copy the entire film as it is, but they also very lazily copy the editing techniques and graphics used in CRIME SPREE too for their Hindi version. For instance, they even write the Title of the film in its opening credits using the same settings of CRIME SPREE and later on also follow the similar graphics of splitting the screen into three parts to show three different people on the screen in their bad Xerox.So when there is nothing in the name of any contributing creativity from either the director, writer or the editor in LOOT, therefore it truly doesn't deserve any more words here, opposing this shameful act of trying to cash in on someone else's hard work and creative expressions." 
" is this EVEN a film?","I don't know why did I paid to watch this.This was unbelievably intolerable...stale story line up, stale expressions,awful and mindless script. First, be forewarned the makers of this film are ballot-stuffing. There's a good reason why you can buy it for less than $1 on Amazon - because it's really BAD.How to describe this film? Put the word "bad" in front of any component of a film, and you've got it. Bad Tarantino/Lock Stock/Get Shorty knock-off. Bad writing. Bad directing. Bad acting. Bad cinematography. Bad continuity.CONCLUSION : This movie is awful. It tries to be funny and fails every time. You can see where you're supposed to laugh, you know the intention is humor, but it's just not funny. The characters are terribly written. They start off as complete fools and by the end they're devising intricate schemes that come together in entirely ridiculous fashion. But the most painful part of watching this movie has to be sitting through these pathetic attempts at humor." 
" WORST you could ever imagine,INTOLERABLE!","Plot : 1/10 This movie is a carbon copy of Crime Spree(2003).The script is poor.Performance : 1/10 You can't like this film because there's your favourite actor in it, just note the stupid jokes and wrong screenplay to know how bad this film is.Music : 1/10 Nothing needs to be reviewed about the music,it was just as bad as the movie.Overall : 1/10 This movie is strictly avoidable,unless you're one for self-punishment.You may get suicidal at the end of it. Its just as bad as salman khan's Bodyguard."
