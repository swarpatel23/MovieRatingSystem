" One of the funniest films of Govinda","I give this movie a straight ten on ten because it makes you laugh non stop. Andaz Apna apna, Deewana Mastana are some of the funniest films ever in Bollywood. Dulhe Raja can be added as one of the funniest films of Hindi cinema. Govinda is one of the funniest actors in Bollywood at the time and this is an example of why. Raveena Tandon looks pretty and she is a good co star with Govinda. There is one fabulous song and that is Akhiyon se goli maare. Johnny Lever is a comedy support in this movie and this mans comic timing is fantastic. Kader Khan is a genius of an comedy actor, he is one of Bollywoods greatest supporting actors. The storyline is not perfect, but it delivers laughs which is good enough." 
" Govinda at his best !!'","Dulhe Raja is what I call Slapstick Comedy at its best. It was made at a time when Govinda was at his peak and the man could make you laugh doing anything on screen.There is no story. Its just a string of sequences pulled together with Govinda being the glue that holds the movie the together. The movie has poor production values and technically no where near the movies made by the Johars and Chopras. But its entertaining which matters the most.Why I watch this film because it makes me laugh each time I watch it. The music is good especially the song 'Akhiyon se Goli Maare'. Also, its a very clean film. You can easily watch this film with a 5 year old and bet he/she will also enjoy without feeling embarrassed. Pure Govinda magic.Supporting Govinda in his madness are Kader Khan and Johnny Lever. When Govinda is not on screen, these two gentleman do more than enough to keep u smiling till Govinda is back. And when the three get together in the climax along with Prem Chopra, its a blast.Some people will call this movie silly. It is but thats the point. Dulhe Raja is a silly film but an entertaining one. Just watch it for Govinda." 
" Winning Performances Make This Comedy Memorable!","Harmesh Malhotra's 'Dulhe Raja' is interesting & funny in bits and pieces, but it's the Winning Performances That Make This Comedy Memorable! The film has some good jokes, that sound even better, thanks to it's talented cast, of whom all, are blessed with impeccable comic timing.'Dulhe Raja' is about Raja, a poor man, played superbly by Govinda, who opens a fast food restaurant right opposite a five star hotel run by its owner Singhania, played hilariously by Kader Khan, and thus begins to earn his wrath. The wealthy hotel owner then uses all his influence to remove Raja, but in vain. Things get worse for the wealthy man, when his daughter Kiran, played by Raveena Tandon, decides to marry the poor hotelier.The Chemistry Between Screen-Rivals Govinda & Kader Khan, is simply flawless. In fact, their portions are truly funny and leave a lasting impression. 'Dulhe Raja' has an interesting first hour, that truly entertains, but, the film loses pace in the second hour, thanks to the weak writing material, that even tends to drag. However, the culmination, though very silly, comes up well. Harmesh Malhotra's Direction is passable. The Soundtrack is nice, while the dialogue are hilarious at times.Performance-Wise: 'Dulhe Raja' works mainly because of it's winning performances. Govinda & Kader Khan, as mentioned, share a flawless chemistry on screen. The Supremely Talented Actors deliver performances, that truly rank amongst their finest works. Johny Lever is another topper. He manages to deliver a lot of laughs in the goings-on. Raveena Tandon is adequate. Asrani does well. Prem Chopra & Mohnish Behl play the bad guys, fairly.On the whole, 'Dulhe Raja' isn't as funny as expected, but yet it deserves a watch for the winning performances it has in store." 
" Vintage Govinda","Good movie, hit music, and laughable gags. As usual, not for the highbrow, but for someone who simply wants laughs. Govinda is good Kader Khan does well too" 
" The unstoppable Raja","Govinda plays Raja, a smart aleck who has a street-side eatery - but it is a huge problem for Kader Khan as the street is a road inside his huge hotel! The eatery is popular with the hotel guests and an eyesore for the hotel owner. Many attempts are made to oust Raja and his eatery but Raja always triumphs and seems unstoppable. Kader Khan has a beautiful daughter Raveena Tandon who has fallen for the scumbag Mohnish Behl and wants to trick her Dad into letting her marry him. Many twists and turns ensue, and lots of slapstick moments later the Dulha (bridegroom) does get his Dulhan (bride)! The funny moments are somehow less funny than the usual Govinda film. The outstanding sequence is a music and dance showdown between Kader Khan and Govinda - who knew the old man could shake and gyrate with the best of them! This is a fun one time watch - but do not go expecting too much, it is brainless entertainment." 
" One of Govinda's good comedies","Govina's films are mostly crude, loud but this is one of his entertaining films like COOLIE No.1The story is old but yet the film is well handled and keeps you involved throughout with good jokes and less loud scenesThe scenes between Kader and Govidna are a true laugh riot and also between Johny Lever who isn't loud here and acts very well Even the romance track is well handledThe film does have some slapstick scenes which are too much but yet they make you laugh mostlyHarmesh Malhotra gives his last best work, His handling of comedy is tremendous here Music is goodGovinda walks away with laurels, of course he has done such roles before but here his act is in full control and he keeps you engaged and laughing throughout which he failed to do in some comedies Raveena is okay in her routine role Kader Khan excels in his role as usual, His scenes with Govinda are the best Johny Lever isn't loud and actually makes you laugh throughout Prem Chopra overacts, Mohinish Behl is routine Rana Jung Bahadur is nothing great Asrani is funny at places" 
" an average dose of cinema from the usual performance by govinda","I saw this movie and in between there were parts in which I wanted to quit. It was an entertainer for the indian masses, but not a considerably good choice for the people who like descent movies. Comedy, action, drama, and romance. A usual combination used in almost all movies. Ok. 5/10"
