" Good story marred by poor script & direction","When the casting shows "Rahul Rawail" as director, you do expect something good from the guy who gave winners like "Arjun" or "Dacait". However, after "Dacait", Rahul Rawail has lost his touch, which was quite apparent in "Anjaam". And with KKKM, it feels it is the time either he takes a course in direction or call it quits.The opening moments of the movie are quite well handed, with the confrontation between Rishi Kapoor and Rati Agnihotri provided as synopsis rather than typical "Rona Dhona" scene. However, as the movie comes into "present time", it degenerates. The opening scenes between Kajol and Sunil Shetty, when they meet in London, are not done properly. As a result, the viewer has no clue as to what is going on.The worst thing about the movie is the useless comedy that has been "shoved in" to provide comic relief. Instead of providing comical relief in the first half of the movie, the director has chosen to provide comic relief in each and every scene. As a result, one is confused whether the movie is a comedy or an emotional drama. Also, the songs keep coming at regular intervals without any need or situation. Not to mention a very mediocre score by Anu Malik and equally bad lyrics by Sameer.As usual, like a typical Hindi movie, KKKM is not without goofs. One cannot imagine that Rati Agnihotri can own a huge departmental store and still thieves can get away without getting caught in the modern day world of video surveillance cameras and security guards. Or is the police of England so ineffective that it cannot provide security to such huge departmental stores. Also, it is ridiculous to see Kajol driving a battle tank right into the parking lot. I wonder when will Indian directors rise from mediocrity and foreign-locations hangups.Performance wise, everybody does their parts without any dedication as none of the characters have been given enough justice to develop in movie due to inevitable comedy situation. Only saving grace is Rati Agnihotri, who like Sharmila seems very fresh unaffected by age. Hope we can see her in better roles in future.In a nutshell, better opt for a pure comedy movie or a family drama instead of watching such uncooked "Khichadi". Yuck" 
" Good old fashioned fun!","When I first went in to see KKKM, I thought that I was in for a bad time, because the first 15 minutes seem extremely unpromising. However, as the movie progressed, it picks up charmingly. The basic premise is a trite one-- the exchange of twins(played so naturally by Kajol that she gets two mentions in the credits)at birth when the parents(Rishi Kapoor and Rati, back after a long time, and looking as if it was just yesterday...)separate, and how the twins reverse the process, ultimately bringing peace to the household. While the movie is nothing great in terms of story or technique, there is a lovely light-hearted treatment of the screenplay by director Rawail(no stranger to Hindi cinema) quite similar to the Hrishikesh Mukherjee-Shakti Samanta comedies of the 70s. The performances are good, especially from Kajol(and Kajol), Rishi and Rati(who have amazing chemistry between them). Sunil Shetty is nice too. All in all a good enjoyable movie, see it with the kids on a lazy Sunday morning, its great "time pass" for the family." 
" Worth a watch!","Like many Suniel Shetty starrers, this film also has a good concept ,but the editing is weak and some scenes are meaningless.There are funny moments though, songs are all very melodious.The main protagonist is Kajol, who has done a good job. Anna's role is not bad.Story is about 2 twins who get separated at birth due to misunderstandings between the parents and the words of their evil step aunt, who wants to grab all the property.They later happen to meet in the UK, where the hero props in, and love blossoms for one of the twins.The rest is about how they go back to deal with the evil people,clear the dust and save their family.One can see beautiful sites in UK and Goa in this film.6 on 10" 
" Very sour, hardly sweet","I'm totally disappointed by Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi. Rahul Rawail had directed many movies, most of them were not up to the mark, but I did like several of his works such as Betaab, Anjaam, Biwi O Biwi, and to an extent Samundar and Arjun Pandit. Here Rawail follows a very old formula: a comedy involving twin sisters, casting a popular actress to play them. This of course reminds us of classic films like Seeta Aur Geeta, a film I can watch even today over and over again and still be totally entertained. But Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi sadly manages to be not more than a corny and formulaic film which is more tiresome rather than entertaining. And it's not specifically because of the twins, it's because of the incredibly poor script. The comedy, the dialogues, the proceedings, everything sounds extremely hackneyed. The story lacks focus and conviction, it is predictable and forced, and even the songs are forgettable. The twin sisters are played by Kajol. She is the only reason I kept watching the movie right until the end, but she is let down by the script despite trying her best to build two different persons on screen. Watch the 1998 Tanuja Chandra-directed Dushman is which she excelled while playing a double role as well, and you'll see how this pales in comparison (although Dushman focused more on one sister and was far from a comedy). The less said about Sunil Shetty - the better. Rishi Kapoor is pretty likable as the father, and Rati Agnihotri is beautiful and lovely. Kuch Khatti Kuch Meethi is unfunny and it's so meaningless that even Kajol can't save it. I assure that you can easily find something to spend your time on, something worthier." 
" Kajol too has given craps","This is one of Kajol's not worst but worthless filmsKajol is supposedly a very intelligent actress but she too has signed many craps, even some of her craps are called great films that is another thingThe film copies PARENT TRAP plus our very old CHAALBAAZ, SEETA AUR GEETARahul Rawail's first comedy and he does very bad Th romance in first half is bad, the comedy is crude at most times The re union of Kajols and the parents are cold The entire act of Suneil acting as the uncle falls flatDirection is old fashioned Music is okayKajol works well as the naughty girl though she irritates at times Suneil is good Rishi and Rati excel" 
" "Parent Trap" rip-off, avoid it!","I have to be honest that even though I like Kajol a lot, and Rishi Kapoor is one of the greatest actors of all time, this film was not meant for both of them to be in. How did they green light this horrible Bollywood version of "The Parent Trap?" This just shows that if a foreign film industry wants to make their own version of another film industry's film, you have to do it well. However, KKKM is one of those that proves they didn't do it well, and you should just stay away from it. Sunil is a great actor but shouldn't have agreed to be in this, and Pooja Batra looks inappropriate for little kids to see. Don't pick this one up, and stay away from it as long as you live!"
