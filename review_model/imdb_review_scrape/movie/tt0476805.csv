" I liked it!","Let's admit it, Bollywood can't really pull off a comedy - not since Andaaz Apna Apna have we seen a decent comedy make it to the silver screen. I'm sick of all these talentless newbies coming into the industry and appearing in "comedies" that are nothing but annoying screaming and complete idiocy.This movie though made me laugh right through. The chemistry between the main characters was fantastic and the acting was superb by the 3 main old dudes. Asrani was also FANTASTIC! The jokes, the reactions, etc were perfectly delivered. The story, although predictable, was a refreshing change and it never felt over cooked and the jokes stayed true to the story line.Good light hearted film!" 
" The New Laurel-n-Hardy !!!!!","At first i have to say that i have never laughed so much in my entire life in cinema...and i have watched and am a fan off all sorts off comedy from Tom and Jerry to Russell Peters Stand Up Comedy (Comedy Central) to the Ace Ventura (Carrey)....but i believe Indian Cinema has never had another Director as brilliant as Priyadarshan to make u go nuts......The Comedy in his movies never stops....one funny bone after another the story keeps hitting all the parts of our body that can laugh....And Secondly,Indian cinema has found its own pair of Comedy Geniuses...Paresh Rawal and Om Puri....the new Rawal-n-Puri duo has given such a commendable comic performance that i believe will give any comedian in World Cinema a run for his money....the pure Innocence of the Village-People of India is portrayed beyond perfection by the Duo...And Thirdly,I do wish (as an avid fan of Good authentic Indian Cinema that has no pastures and Trees with Chipmunks running around them with a back ground filled with "music" from the Wedding Planners in Heaven !!!!)that the Rawal-Puri duo get all the right awards and commendations for their respective roles....which i have a sinking feeling will go to charismatic "HEROES" off the so-called "Bollywood"......And,at last but not the least....Kudos to all the Cast of this rib-tickling comic havoc....Keep up the brilliance people...heres awaiting more..." 
" Even if its a remake it rox....","I know I know, this is a remake, but still, it is screamingly funny, and it isn't everyday that u find a screamingly funny Hindi movie in the theaters... True its really sad that Bolly is now copying ideas for comedies as well, but it doesn't matter, cos this is funny as well... the entire movie is set by Paresh Rawal. he controls the pace of the movie, Om Puri and Asrani give him good support. The acting is good. These veterans bring out the authentic UP/Bhojpuri Hindi. Ritesh DEshmukh as usual does a good performance on his part. Shakti Kapur is again very nice in his own small way... The good thing is that the director wisely reduced the number of songs...Overall 8/10!!!" 
" i can't stop laughing!","I finally watched "waking ned devine", it was not as funny as I expected. I have to say that I love this one much better. Here is what I wrote a few weeks ago.I didn't know that this movie was a remake of the English movie, but it didn't diminish how funny this movie is. The storyline fits with the specific Indian village setting pretty good.I had to rewind quite a few times just to watch those funny scenes again. It is a comedy, not a history movie, so there is no need to check the facts to see if they are correct or not."Chup Chup Ke" was the first Indian comedy that I have seen, I rated that one a 9. I also rated this movie a 9. Those actors were pretty good, and their facial expressions are priceless.I truly enjoyed it very much. I may watch it again after a few years to have another good laugh." 
" One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long while","This movie is one of the best I have seen coming out of India. It has a very complex plot that is very well put together. The acting is top notch. The movie is also one of the funniest I have seen in a long time. It made me laugh and laugh and laugh. Highly Recommended !!! Someone wrote that it is inspired by another movie. Most movies have been inspired by some other movie or story. The movie is set in a small and very poor village in modern day India and is about a lottery ticket reseller whose customer wins 1 crore rupees. The man dies of happiness but not before he has told his estranged sister and half the village. What follows is a riot of side splittingly funny events as the lottery ticket reseller tries to keep it a secret and in the process make some money." 
" Movie which worked without big stars","They are some films which work due to big stars but Priyadarshan's MALAMAAL WEEKLY which had Paresh, Om Puri in main leads worked just on the popularity of Paresh and people who like Priyadarshan's comedyThe film is a remake of WAKING NED DIVINE(1998)The film has a good plot and the comedy is situational like HERA PHERI but the problem being the film drags in between and too many characters also the comedy at places is too crudeThe film otherwise follows 1 track throughout and doesn't break into dances.etc the romance is also non filmy The chaos that ensue due to the hidden lottery and many gags are hilarious The film keeps your attention most of the film only the film tends to drag here and there The climax also follows the typical Priyadarshan style where people chase othersDirection by Priyadarshan is good but his claiming that he wrote the script is faulty as the film is a remake of WAKING NED Music(only 1 song in the background) is okayParesh Rawal entertains though his new look is bad but yet he is good though nothing new Om Puri is good but hams at places Ritiesh though sidelined does a great job Reema Sen is okay Sudha Chandran is good Arbaaz Khan is good Asrani is as usual, loud and so is Shakti Kapoor and Rajpal Yadav the rest are okay" 
" Definitely one of the funniest movie I have seen in a long time","Definitely one of the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. One thing leading to another in a village full of uneducated people.Paresh Rawal is undoubtedly one of Bollywood's finest and best actors when it comes to essaying such character driven roles as the greedy lottery ticket salesman he plays in Malamaal Weekly. It's almost hard to believe that it's the same guy who played the guru cultist in 'No Smoking' and then the suave lawyer , he is just too good. Om Puri, Paresh Rawal, Ritesh Deshmukh, Rajpal Yadav and Seema Biswas are all in their element as they round out the cast in supporting roles. I really liked this film and I recommend it to others.In the city of the blind, the one eyed man is king." 
" A total Paisa Wasool","A very nice comedy after a long time...free of nudity, vulgarity etc ... a complete family entertainer. A great theme making people laugh from the beginning till the end of the movie. Although the film has stars of the fame like The great comedy king Paresh Rawal, Om Puri, Asraani, Sudha Chandran, Ritesh, Shakti Kapoor etc but still the movie doesn't look cluttered with stars... Star of the Show is "Baaje" n "Leela" And unlike most of other comedy movies.. the end of Malamaal Weekly is still grasping and very very comic. A total Paisaa Wasool.... A bit overdoing on part of Ritesh.. But still a good Timepass. Do watch!!" 
" Just a knock off of a much better movie","For some reason I think this probably violates some sort of copy-write law. This is the exact same plot line as an Irish movie made in 1998 called Waking Ned Divine. Similarities such as holding a dinner to find the winner; discovering the actual winner has died from shock after discovering he's won; and bringing the town together to trick the lottery official. The similarities in plot line and characters are too close to be coincidence. Watch Ned Divine before calling this movie hilarious and original. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166396/" 
" Wasted Time","Something is wrong out there. The genre of comedy is not going through a very good phase in Bollywood. There was a time when a movie like "Malamaal Weekly" would have been very highly appreciated for its great slap-stick, nincompoop approach to humor. Unfortunately, a new wave of directors have set such high standards in film-making, scripting and screenplay, that an idiot-ride like the one under mention here cannot go unpunished.The heavy dosage of actors cannot save this film. In fact, they are just as much to blame in messing it up. Except, perhaps Ritesh Deshmukh, who gets better with his films. Let's go through the cast, one by one: Paresh Rawal: Plays Lilaram, the lottery ticket seller. Bad teeth, worse jokes. Not as annoying as he was in Garam Masala, but seems to be fading out on the comedy scene. A possible favorite of Priyadarshan, and no doubt a brilliant actor, but this director has worn him out. Give him something new to do.Om Puri: ballu, the milkman. Now, why is it that we see Om Puri, a great character artist of commercial and parallel cinema, doing comedy so often. i feel he has limited ability in comedy. he seems to be playing the same kind of character over and over again. Slightly temperamental, very opinionated, etc. Leave him to his serious roles.Rajpal Yadav: Nothing new ever comes out of him.Asrani: He's an "Angrezon ke zamane ka comedian". This generation needs something else to laugh.Shakti Kapoor: They're still offering him movies?? Innocent: Really famous comedian from South India, but I think his voice was dubbed by Tiku Talsania.Ritesh Deshmukh: The only decent performance in the movie. His scenes are the most bearable.Reema Sen: Plays the village belle. Wears make-up all the time.Arbaaz Khan: Confused and hurried as usual.I am not going to discuss the plot, but overall the movie was stretched beyond tolerance and the amount of characters that were there was completely unnecessary. If you want to watch an actually funny movie along the same lines, watch "Rat Race". I think "Malamaal Weekly" could've been inspired by that." 
" Its a sad day when priyadarshan has to make a remake and that too a bad one. (of an English movie not his own south movie as he wants us to believe)","I must admit i really went into this movie with a lot of expectations and trust me thats not the only reason i found this movie to be bad.For starters this movie is the remake (and a pathetic one) of the British film "Waking Ned Devine" which i saw years ago and was an utterly delightful movie that captured the essence of the English countryside.As such this movie follows the same themes although the movie claim that the village is small consisting of 100-150 khidkis (homes) is not evident anywhere i must have seen at least that many or more people in this film. Also the false picture or racial mixture in the village was to hard to digest (a bloody drunk anthony in a small village in India talk about rubbish stereotypes and in fact there is more than one anthony in the same village wtf).You cannot emphasize how many absurdities this movie has that are hard to digest even for a comedy. Seriously after Hera Pheri its all been downhill for priyadarshan.Also what the hell is it with him and connected people it wasn't funny in hungama and its definitely not funny here.The only reason this movie gets a 4 is because the acting is top notch and the cast of main actors do a great job i keep repeating it but i feel ritesh deshmukh has a bright future playing the average joe guy due his bad looks and good acting(lets not forget his politician father).Also there are some genuinely funny scenes in the movie but this movie lacks any genuine original humour.All in a movie making disaster but can be watched due to top notch performances of the actors and some genuinely funny scenes.Watch it in the matinée or television debut though.(not wasting 200 bucks to watch it an inox)" 
" Fun Happenings","The woman in the sidecar going around the village is just hilarious. By the way she (Sudha Chandran) fits the part well with her svengali makeup, heavy jewelery and zabardast attitude, that is in total reverse of a typical village woman-and that in itself is funny. Then we have probably the greatest comedy characters of the Indian Cinema-Paresh Rawal and Om Puri-the Laurel and Hardy of Hindi comedy. Just looking at these two brings a chuckle. Priyadarshan, is one of the few producers who understand comedy unlike these "Banchods of Bollywood" producing filthy toilet humor movies like "Delhi Belly" and "Three Idiots" which is demeaning to Indians and comedy at the expense of the Indians. These scum maggots donot represent India nor Indians and they should be kicked out of the industry and sent back to where they came from. This is a movie that has a subtle meaning behind the comedy. Few scenes are redundant like the dead Anthony ending up on the tree. Some of the subplots are too drawn out. I guess this is to satisfy the average movie goer in a village who wants paisa vasool and and an eyecandy "Item number" which in this context is provided by Rakhi Sawant. It would have been nice that if she were to be one of the charecteres in the village, instead of just an item. The movie is enjoyable-for the masses who are starved for good comedy." 
" If a dead man wins a lotto ticket, who will the money go to?","This movie is worth watching- that is if you want the time to pass and if you're bored out of you're mind. It was quite humorous, but not very memorable. I think this movie would have been excellent if only it was cut about an hour or so, because it really did drag on.The characters were brilliantly casted, and the acting was very well rehearsed. But honestly, this movie isn't worth three hours of you're time. It's unique, because the whole plot isn't some sappy love story, but the again it really does DRAG ON.I'll say that one more time to make myself clear. This movie really does DRAG ON.Watch this if you're bored out of you're mind, and want to see something humorous, but not "memorable humorous." I mean, after the movie ends, you won't be like "Oh, ha-ha! I remember when so-and-so did that- classic!" You're reaction will more be like "huh. That was not too bad. What's for dinner?"" 
" it is not funny movie.","I really like the flow of movie. Because it shows all kinds of usual and unusual situations which might occur and how cunningly to handle them. The lesson I learn is "If you get something which is not your own then take it but not alone, also distribute among those who needs it". One more lesson "You one lie force you to speak thousand more lie". The whole movie revolves around the concept "Money can anybody blind". Movie involves people from village whose thinking is different from urban people. In village any sort of issue spread as fire but if the same movie involved urban people, story would be completely different.I appreciate way of showing the greediness on screen." 
" Disappointing, after all the hype","I bamboozled my sister into going to this movie since I'd heard such a lot about it and had a lot of expectations. Needless to say ... we were both sorely disappointed by what we were subjected to! For starters,the movie is a slap-stick of the worst kind! There are portions that are funny, but by and large, one has to make a major effort to even figure out what the jokes are all about. It's almost like someone trying to tickle one forcibly to elicit some laughter, but all that one succeeds at is to make the person ill-humoured and crabby! Why does Paresh Rawal need to wear a pair of dentures that start out by looking like they need to be cleaned ... then this happens (that is there are a couple of scenes where the dentures are sparkling), only to be stained again, probably when the continuity-man notices the flaw! Paresh Rawal has tremendous comic potential ... his acting calibre is truly remarkable. Why did he accept a role in such a "D-graded" movie??Most of the senior, established actors, though talented, seem to have wasted their efforts in this movie. Rajpal Yadav too seems to have got stuck in a rut with his mannerisms and dialogue delivery. He should try to break out of this mould before his style becomes any more clichéd!As for Riteish Deshmukh ... he was about the only pleasant surprise. He's probably best suited to the role of the smart-aleck villager ... or at any rate, he's portrayed his role very well! As for his love interest ... the less one says about her, the better!! She behaves like a socialite who's been thrust into a rural setting ... and hates every moment of it!There are quite a few discrepancies other than the one mentioned above. Anthony's position, expression etc. change through the movie. As for his sister, Mary, there are at least a couple of times that she utters, "Hey! Bhagawan!" ...IN SPITE of being a Christian! Being an animal lover, I found selling the pet goat to the butcher, in very bad taste. It could have been avoided.The situations are also very forced and this mars the general flow of the narration.All in all, what with all the advertisement and hype leading up to the release of the movie (including a "lottery") one expects a bit more than what one gets.I would sincerely dissuade people from spending large sums of money (thanks to the rates at Inox!) in order to see this film. Those who do go and see it ...well, don't tell me that you weren't warned!!" 
" What a crap, total waste of time.","Can I rate this movie in negative. Lol, total crap. What a disaster. Why am i even wasting my time on writing a review on this movie. Priyadarshan, you owe me 2 hrs of my life. I think he should stop making comedy movies. Hera Pheri was a fluke, it happens once in a lifetime. I would suggest everyone to watch this movie at least once. Afterall, why should I be the only one to face this disaster, ha ha. In the second half of the movie, I was desperately waiting for the movie to end. If Priyadarshan cant make a decent film with actors like Paresh Rawal and Om Puri, he does not deserve in the film industry. I can just keep bad mouthing this film for the rest of the day (or may be life). I guess I am feeling a little less frustration now. Hope I get over this."
