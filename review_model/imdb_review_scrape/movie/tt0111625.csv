" One of Ajay best movies..............","I liked this movie very much ........Ajay is playing a blind guy who gets transformed his eyes from his friend when he was young ...he devoted never to take of his glasses unless he saw the guy that kill his parents in hospital.....And also the movie has a very good action from Ajay Devgan...Tabu looks good with Ajay and this movie is one of my favorites ...........i would recommend this movie to every who is a fan of Ajay n Tabu.............. Vijay Bat was on of the best movies in the 90s and at that time Ajay was one of the highest paid actores...the movie also has a good romantic between Ajay and Tabu... This movie is one movie that I would like watch over and over again I gave 100% good movie..........." 
" Good in parts","Ajay Devgan after PHOOL AUR KAANTE(1991) his debut kept doing action hero roles Most of his films had him playing a guy who was wronged and who seeks revengeThis is another one with a slight difference being Ajay seeks revenge of his master Half the film you have Ajay wearing glasses to hide his eyes which are of his deceased master's son Even during the songs Ajay has the glasses on He also does a stunt on 1 bike like he did in PAK but here only on 1 bike Suresh Oberoi his father prepares a gun from his crutches LOLThe film is typical 90's style but it's well handled in parts The clashes between Danny and Ajay are well handled and there are several engaging scenes There are also forced comedy scenes and songsDirection is okay Music is decentAjay does his trademark angry young man role and does a good job Tabu in one of her first films does an okay job as the heroine Amongst rest Danny is typical, Gulshan is funny Suresh Oberoi is okay" 
" Awesome","This movie is a typical 90s flick with revolving doors, songs in random places, mad stunts, a motorbike, rich villain and a revengeful heroOne scene has Ajay Devgan doing a mad stunt on his motorbike like PHOOL AUR KAANTE (1991) which he had two bikes but in this he has 1 The next scene has Suresh Oberoi converting his crutch to a gun LOLThe film has some engaging scenes between Danny and Ajay The film keeps you hooked during the scenesAjay Devgan normally plays the person who was guilty of something he never did and takes revenge However in this he takes revenge for his master He looses his eyesight but when his friend donates his eyes to him, he wears dark sunglasses and vows never to take his glasses off until he confronts DilawarAjay plays his role to perfection Tabu doesn't support much but is good Danny plays a good villain Suresh is usual Gulshan Grover is funny" 
" One of Devgan's good action films from the 90s","Ajay Devgan is a name that defined action and only action in the 90s after which he started doing different kind of roles. He is a versatile actor known for some of his decent action films from the 90s, some of his hit comedy films from the 20s, and some of his awesome gangster films from the 20s too. However, most of his movies had the same revenge formula like most films from the 90s. Moreover, some of his films were pretty bad from the 90s and it is the 2000 and onwards period where he tasted a lot of success. Despite started 2000 with a few disasters, he had some brilliant films like Company that got him the recognition he needed. However, in the 90s period some of his action movies were decent even for being a typical romantic action film with bits of comedy.Vijaypath is one his earlier action films from the year 1994. The film is an revenge action film where Ajay seeks revenge of the family his dad used to drive for. His family dies because they dared to mess with the brother of the villain and Danny is the evil and cunning villain. Not only does he kill Karan's father but the Judge who hanged his brother(the main relative of the house). Karan looses his eyesight but after the mother, and his childhood friend Babloo dies, Karan gets his eyes. The first half of the film shows Ajay Devgan in glasses and his entry action scene is superb. The on goings have Karan clashing into Danny but before that we have some romance after Karan meets his love Monica played by Tabu. Tabu falls for him and both want to get married. Monica's dad also agrees with this relationship but they can't actually get married now can they. These typical movies always have the weddings at the end and that's not a bad thing actually. Karan's guardian the last living relative of the Saxena family dies from Danny's goons and Dilawar has him killed. But before he could die, Karan rescues him from the villains, sadly Rajeshwar Saxena dies in Karan's arms and before he dies, Karan promises him to take revenge. From now the movie has several hard hitting dialogs, action scenes, Gulshan Grover's hilarious comedy and so on. The end action scene where Ajay fights with a tiger is stupid as it's not possible for a man to win against a tiger but it is demonstrated in an OK manner. The final sequence is good and the ruination of the lovers at the end is the typical ending and it is well shown.Direction by Farooq Sidique is good, the same guy who directed Ajay Devgan in Jigar(Ajay's second hit film), gives him another hit(Yes, Vijay Path was a hit film). He handles most scenes well but he could have better supervised the editing as some scenes tend to drag. But overall, a good job.Performances are decent, Ajay Devgan is awesome as Karan, he acts in most scenes quite well but he hams his anger up in a few scenes but overall, a job well done.Tabu is gorgeous as the heroine and her chemistry with Ajay Devgan is quite good, she even acts well. This is their first hit after which they reunite with Haqueeqat another hit film. Danny Denzongpa is a brilliant villain, I consider him and Amirsh Puri the best villain on Bollywood from the 80s and 90s. Danny's dialog delivery is superb, his expressions are decent too. Gulshan Grover is hilarious and his comedy is fun like in most films of Ajay Devgan. He is always the comical villain in the typical Ajay Devgan 90s action film. The others lend good support, Reema Lagoo is getting typical though, she does much better in Rajshri films like HUM SAATH SAATH HAIN.Music is a winner, most songs were hits. Rukh Rukh and Aur Hum Tumhare Hai became a rage, they ruled for quite a while in the 90s period. Action is brilliant though clichéd in some scenes. The final action scene is a bit clichéd though enjoyable. The tiger fight is overdone and it does tend to drag though Ajay does a good job with the action and why wouldn't he? The action is conducted by the master of action Action director Veeru Devgan(his father).Overall, a decent film from the 90s and it did revive Ajay's slogging career from 1993 flop films and the disaster Kanoon which was his first release from 1994." 
" i saw it back in 94 i guess..","i saw it back in 1994 when it was released, i was barely in any state to conclude anything(i was ..what 10 then) but i was a huge fan of action flicks and ajay devgun was my personal favourite(my brother made me like him). anyways... i have given it 10 out of 10 as it used to be my favourite movie(kids are so mindless,aren't they?!) and i love everything about this movie. ajay was terrific,tabu looked most beautiful and everything was just near perfect. i haven't seen the movie again(i never got a chance) but i would love to see it again sometime. Things has really changed over the years,ajay now actually being recognised for what he really is- one of the finest actor in this generation. But at the very time i get a feeling that this man is doing great work he comes up with some total crap like blackmail or main aisa hi hoon.. ajay, please don't do this!"
