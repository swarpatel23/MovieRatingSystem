" Kasak just didnt have enough Kasak to be a watchable film","Kasak just didnt have enough Kasak to be a watchable film. (Kasak is an urdu word which means pain, affliction) It is boring, uninspiring, cliched, dead on arrival, copied (or inspired from Krzysztof Kieslowski's White, seriously?), and most of all, film doesn't do anything to make us believe into what movie is trying to show nor does the acting. I am rating it 1 and half stars."
