" Two men that have a unique way of thinking.","This movie will start a new trend in bollywood The cast are superb especially the main 2 actors The dialogues are ace and the delivery even better The plot is well thought out. The choreography is ace. The songs are not too bad but the film compensates for errors there. If you loved 'style' you will love this. The costumes suit the type of film it is. The films fictional premise is a relief from the somewhat tiresome bollywood films that we have to bear that have a standard script and are not dependant on good acting ability. Shah Rukh Khan do something that challenges you acting an evil role or something which shows you in a different light.... like this movies superb actors have done!" 
" FORMULA 36","This movie clocks in at just over 2 1/2 hours which includes 4 Bollywood musical numbers. Bantu and Chantu are brothers who are also film-flam artists. They scam their way into a hotel management school where they meet and fall in love with the daughters of two rich hotel owners. Then in the last part of the film, the brothers must perform a task to win the approval of the rich fathers.The humor is primarily skit type humor with the jokes being fairly universal. One joke deals with reincarnation, "You must have been born after a 100 scoundrels had died." Some of the jokes appeared to be sexual humor that didn't translate too well. The acting was Bollywood camp style. One the lyrics in the song claimed a woman was desired because her measurements were 36-34-36. I think they missed on that one. The film plot circles back on itself with a good reuse of characters.Parental guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity." 
" Low-IQ comedy","This sequel came nothing close to the first movie, Style.  The heroines gave terrible debuts.  Songs were awful.  The movie blatantly poked fun at and objectified women.  It took five minutes to churn out one joke, and by then, it had lost its potential to be funny.  Seems like the success of Style had gone up to the two actors' heads as they seemed very overconfident." 
" Below average","After the hit STYLE(2001) which itself was nothing great but just a funny timepass movie N Chandra makes a sequel titled on the famous song of STYLE, XCUSE METhe film shows how the characters Chantu and Bantu now take up a Hotel management courseThere are some funny scenes like Sharman and Saahil fooling Saurabh Shukla and then Saurabh realising the truth and planning revenge but the comedy fails at many places or isn't as effective as STYLEThe pranks played by Sahil and Sharman outsmarting each other work well but then the story stagnates and the ending is badDirection is average to below average Music is okaySharman again delivers a natural performance after STYLE and his expressions and dialogue delivery is too good Saahil Khan shows improvement and is better but still has a long way to go The heroines are ordinary Saurabh Shukla is funny Mushtaq Khan is hilarious and also Snehal Dabi while rest are okay"
