" Maximum is no Sehar","The nexus between politicians, police and gangster is so strong that there will be no dearth of story revolving around it. Director Kabeer Kaushik tried to rope in some real incidences to tell a story on this theme. Being closely associated with police which he had proved by being the director of "Seher" which was undoubtedly one of the best realistic Indian film on police force, the expectation from Kaushik is maximum but sadly "maximum" doesn't reach to the maximum potential of the director. The film revolves around Mumbai the city to chase one's dream to its maximum and this is the same city that gives maximum space to outsiders. Starting in Max-Mumbai 2003 the story ends just after 26/11 2008 terrorist attack and in the span of half a decade we see the rise and fall of few police men, builders, politicians and journalist. With ego clashes leading to cold war which gets bloody with the proceedings it seem that whole system was more interested in settling their own scores totally ignorant of the foreign development which led to the massive 26/11 attack. Loosely based on facts the film does reflects the negligence of the system which led to the catastrophe and all because of two self indulgent police officers' ego to outwit one another. And in the web we have the ministers, senior police men, builders all caught up to gain the maximum power and in between a media journalist using that rivalry to climb up the ladder of his career. At a script level Kabeer Kaushik does had a nice story to tell but it lost in translation as the proceedings goes on and on without anything much happening. Even audience were aware that everyone will double cross the other to reach to the zenith so nothing came as a surprise. Even the last twist about the supposed "good" character being the main conspirator didn't come as surprise as it could be well gauged earlier. The credit should be given for the creation of so many grey characters but then when you throw in a dicey "white" men inside a bunch of "greys" it becomes evident that that person possess some dubious qualities covered under his diplomatic existence. As a director the story telling method of Kaushik is commendable as he uses non-liner narrative to keep in some mystery in the proceedings but the time taken to build up the main story was too lengthy for audience's patience and amidst facts and file there seems to be a lack of soul. The characters came and go but they didn't seem to touch the audience even when he tried to show the emotional bonding of Pandit & his family. It is true that at the end one will feel for Pandit's daughter but by then one have already developed enough apathy than empathy. Few sequences does deserve mention like the one where Pandit's father who is an English professor shouting lines from Shakespeare standing under rain in a rainy deserted marine drive. Then the sequence where the minister tells the journalist how Mumbai is open to outsiders but to a certain level. The camera gave a feeling of claustrophobic existence amidst treacheries but the back ground score tried to hard to make it a thriller.Editing was just perfect as the continuity of the frames in the non-liner blocks didn't seem disjointed. There is a small animated sequence, even though out of place, was neatly done. There is no scope for song but still an item song (the famous telugu song "Aa aante amplapuram" remake) is forced and one gets to see the sexy Hazel Keech in it. Sonu Sood as Pandit impresses. His cold look with hint of smile and "dabang-ed" moustache does reflect authority. Except the scene in the climax where he brakes down he is quite effective and confident otherwise. Naseeruddin Shah doesn't seem to be interested in the film. As an actor of such reputation he didn't seem to fit the bill. Neha Dhupia was acceptable as the simple saree clad wife of Pandit. Mohan Agashe repeats himself as the commissioner. Amit Sadh as the journalist was quite impressive. His gradual success over the period of 6 years reflected in his mannerism and his dress. Vinay Pathak is not in his regular comic avatar but he leaves a mark as the minister who wants to make it big in Mumbai even though considers himself as outsider in the maximum city. Rajendra Gupta is impressive as Pandit's father.There are other actors like Arya Babber, Anjana Sukhani who fills the gap. The climax at the railway bridge, the gun shots, the vulnerability of human existence, the corrupt human minds all are brilliantly crafted but somehow while watching those I got flashes of Sehar's climax where you have the brilliant Pankaj Kapoor, the professor who is using the gun for the first time and that nervousness is captured with perfection. May be I shouldn't have taken the memories of Seher while watching this but then that is the problem when a director makes such a brilliant film it becomes his trade mark. and when both the films are about Police men.Sadly Kabeer Kaushik's new venture lacked the excellent craftsmanship shown in his debut film Seher. On a whole Maximum is a strictly average fare." 
" A marginally different take on an already explored plot.","With his debut film SEHAR in 2005, director Kabeer Kaushik made a fine start as it was indeed a promising thriller revolving around the police officials. Though he didn't come out with anything great in his next ventures but still I was excited to see his MAXIMUM since the director had once again chosen the same genre of a Crime Thriller similar to his debut film supported by an interesting talented star cast.However after watching it, I was once again disappointed as the film couldn't deliver what it promised through its promos and publicity campaign. MAXIMUM fails to make a solid impact mainly because it keeps revolving around the same overused plot of Encounter Specialists & their two way links with the criminals and the politicians. Hindi Cinema has already seen a pure masterpiece made on the same subject directed by Shimit Amin with the title "Ab Tak Chhappan"featuring Nana Patekar. Now if compared to this famous gem, MAXIMUM falters at many places in its uninspiring screenplay despite of having some commendable performances from the cast.Admittedly the basic theme of the film is marginally different from the usual as here we get to see the professional rivalry between two encounter specialists only fighting with each other while being in the same department. So the tension is not really between the police and the underworld, but its actually between the two police officials themselves. Besides the title MAXIMUM rightly point outs towards the unbelievable kind of POWER enjoyed by the people sitting at the top. It's a symbolic kind of title trying to say that everyone is just willing to get the maximum power in his hands to rule on others. And that's what makes the whole game ugly, brutal and deadly.The story of the film travels from 2003 to 2008 also covering the 26/11 Mumbai Attack. But it never tends to hit hard, engross or surprise the viewer with any sharp twist in its few well shot sequences. It starts calmly and maintains the same pace throughout without any great build up in its script to reach the climax. As a result, one only feels having watched some decent performances in a non-entertaining film made on a potential plot but nothing more than that. It has characters based on few real life personalities but doesn't have a well written screenplay with enough content to keep the viewer absorbed.Sonu Sood visibly tries hard but he is too smart (looks wise) to play a cunning encounter specialist. No doubt he gives a fine performance as the tough cop but Nasseruddin Shah as his rival certainly leaves a stronger impact. Surprisingly Nasser gets only few scenes in the script and those too without any clap worthy dialogues as such. So against all indications given by its promos, the film doesn't have any great confronting scenes between the two actors ignited with some fiery lines. In the supporting cast, Vinay Pathak (thankfully not in a comic role), Mohan Agashe and Amit Sadh are fine in their respective portrayals. Ujjwal Chopra, Swanand Kirkire & Rajendra Gupta (with his delightful insights on life) could have delivered much more with some extra focus whereas Arya Babbar continues trying to overplay in his cameo. In the female team, Anjana Sukhani has nothing to do in the script or probably her role was simply chopped off (as it seems) since there were reports of her character being inspired from a known actress. Conversely Neha Dhupia once again is a revelation in her subtle, sober and deglamorised role of a housewife and she perfectly looks the same.Musically the subject had no scope of any songs, still we have the usual item number inserted here 'Aa Ante Amlapuram", which has successfully managed to grab some attention on the channels. Plus the background score continues to impress throughout, with soft piano notes superbly incorporated in the arrangement without any extra noisy insertions. So the few well shot sequences of the film (like the climax) get perfectly supported by the Cinematography and Background Music department, which surely should be considered as an achievement by the team.Overall MAXIMUM doesn't really give you the content promised by its promotional campaign. It does have some good performances and few well directed sequences depicting a slightly different plot. But with an uninteresting script lacking the much required pace, one majorly feels like being "Not Served" in the end while walking out of the theater." 
" MAXIMUM Height of nonsense and stupidity","MAXIMUM Height of nonsense and stupidity. Script is really bad. No logic at all. Dialogues are pathetic too. Sometimes they try to become intellectual but that was only in their mind not in visual. They always tried to give some realistic feel in scenes but rather than enhancing it, they took the graph downwards. In a serious discussion character asks or does some other minuscule things to give the authenticity but it distracts only. There were few scenes which could have been better especially the scene where Pandit tries to tie her daughter's laces but it was so exaggerated and unnecessarily repeated that it could not have any impact. There is a good item song. Lyrically I was not able to understand but tune was good "Aa yela ...kari..". If this would be in a big star cast movie then it must have clicked. Performance wise Naseer saab rocks always. Rest are so so. I would be very apprehensive to watch the Director, Mr. Kabeer Kaushik future projects. This was my first movie of him but he is three movie old, SEHAR. CHAMKU and HUM TUM AUR GHOST. Camera work is also very bad, unnecessary panning and soft focusing." 
" Boring","This movie was totally time wasting film Screenplay is good storyline is bad direction is worst editing is barely average Songs are not that good Performances are some good and some badSonu did well nasserudin is good in negative character they only make a impact no one elseNeha is OK but she would have been better arya failed Amit is really awkward in a small role vinay does bad and other actors are really bad Don't use too much time on this crapEnding was so depressing as why did Sonu died which made me hated the movie so badly" 
" Good Cop Drama, But Not For Everyone","I am fan of Sonu Sood and Kabeer Kaushik, I never missed any of their movies.. So I had good expectation from this also. Movie is based on Cop and political life in Mumbai between year 2003- 2008. About the characters, Sonu sood is rough n tough cop (Encounter Specialist) and he is the one with most screen appearance, he is impressive in first half but lose his moments in second. Naseerudin shah is another cop against Sonu but he is hardly there with 3-4 dialogs so we may say its a special appearance. Vinay Pathak is good in his politician avatar. Shocked to see talent like Arya Babbar (Ready, Yaar Anmulle) in such role that too for 10 mins, like whats the point to cast such an excellent actor in this sort of role. Neha dhupia is good as an housewife. Anjana Sukhani, Rajendra Gupta, Mukesh Bhatt and Murli Sharma were all waisted. The person who really shines here is Amit Sadh (Kohinoor, Guns a& Roses). He portrays his character of journalist in a simple manner the only character who don't have grade shades in the movie. He is husband of Punjabi actress Neeru Bajwa (Jihne Medra Dil Luteya, Jatt N Juliet).Climax is very much similar to Sehar but Sehar was a top class movie. Kabeer Kaushik did his best in Direction part but still this movie lacks something. And On acting part Sonu sood (except climax) and Amit are the one who act tremendously in this movie (though we cant ignore Vinay Pathak Politician role)... A Good cop politician movie after Sehar. But this movie is not for everyone....." 
" A typical Indian movie, with Two cops fighting for their profits and power.","Alright, This was somewhat stupid of me to go and watch this movie, But i was getting bored, din't have much to do.. so thought of giving it a try!First of all, Sonu sood still needs to learn acting.. The plot of the movie fails to tell what is the movie all about, and the screenplay is weak too. Story is too slow, and some scenes are not required at all, their presence has just made the movie worse. Nasiruddin shah was not at all impressive.. and neha dhupia really dint have much to do in the movie. In all, Not preferred. Wait for the DVD to come out. It a Die Hard Sonu Sood/ NS fan, Still can wait and check it out in weekdays! Not worth to watch in a weekend."
