" Another sexist product","I can't believe I expected anything better out of this. This is the theme of the movie: 'All husbands should hit their wives. All men are right. All women are wrong. Men can drink alcohol, but women can't. The thought of even a grown, 30 year-old man spending a second without his mother is blasphemous. It's okay to build a relationship on nothing but lies.' What ridiculous double standards! It's movies like this that make me ashamed to be an Indian. The only reason I gave this 5 stars is because the culture clashes depicted in the marriage are realistic, and Shilpa did a stellar job. I agree that Shilpa isn't a role model wife either with her wanting to (even though she didn't) carry out an abortion. That's where I give Salman his due on wanting to protect his child. Even after that, he sticks by his ego and is willing to ruin his 2 month-old child's life by kicking his wife out of his house. The only reason he goes back is because dear mommy tells him to. Thank goodness for her. I can't believe that in this day and age there are still films coming out that promote domestic abuse. I'm hoping that it has something to do with the fact the movie was delayed 5 years or so." 
" Trying to be extremely unbiased...","This movie, I feel, is directed specifically towards the traditional Indian male chauvinist. So being totally unbiased I will tell the positive and negative points of the film.Positive: To start out, great and funny songs. Great acting by the whole cast. For the perspective of the traditional male Indian chauvinist, I felt they were able to portray it very well. They kept the essence of the perspective having a woman judge choose that Salman Khan, the protagonist, should have the right over the divorce and child, so his wife, Shilpa Shetty could not abort the baby or divorce until the baby was born and didn't depend on her. They justified scenes of spousal abuse due to situations in which the wife was at fault due to modern thinking which is not conventional in traditional Indian marriage. They brought up how wrong it would be for the son in law to stay with his sasu sasra (in laws), and how shameful it would be. Anytime a woman rose to power, especially the actress who played Shilpa Shetty's Mom, her ideas were dismissed. They were dismissed from her husband and Salman Khan. This is symbolic when he threw her framed photo in the trash. I feel that this movie was in a way like a revolutionary movie, in which they build the audience they gear their subject towards to really feel that everything Salman Khan did in this movie was justified. When showing a revolutionary Indian movie, a Britisher may not enjoy watching-likewise, a liberal woman with a more forward way of thinking probably will probably not enjoy this subject the most. But then again you must look at the movie as who it is being geared towards and then based on that have a sense of opinion. One has to go into a movie open minded.Negative: Although this is meant to target a specific audience, I don't think this movie was fair in letting you hear enough of both perspectives for you to leave the movie and judge who was right and who is wrong in a given situation. This movie is extremely biased towards the traditional Indian male chauvinist perspective. I think they could have appealed to more people if they allowed you to relate to the women more. It's true you got to hear reasons how Shilpa was forward thinking, but you never knew why. They never offered to justify that she could have been right in the way she thought, because I feel like they think even thinking that way is wrong. Every time a modern thought was brought up, it was quickly dismissed, which is a major fault in the film. It is crucial to relate to a film, and this is only possible through character depth by having the audience hear everyone's side equally. Last Words: If I could give this film a specific rating, I'd give it a 6.75. The acting was good by everyone, and the story line was a kind of Chalte Chalte meets Salaam Namaste. But being the victim, as a liberal woman, I feel that this movie, although rightfully able to target a traditional male, wasn't able to satisfy both perspectives equally. If it even did that, I would rate it higher. Also, it's just not a film that I felt could appeal to many people, so I rated it lower. You may disagree, we all have our biases, but like I said in my summary- I tried to be as unbiased as I possibly could. I hope whoever you are, if you watch this movie, you watch it with an open mind, keeping close attention to gender differences and class differences. If you are like me, and want a movie that better goes into character depth analysis and sees all perspectives and doesn't try to put characters at fault, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna is the movie for you. Enjoy and I hope I did this film justice." 
" i have three words for you "A great BORE"","This is what the movie exactly is a huge bore. nothing interesting ever happens. Nothing surprises you. While watching the movie you feel as if you have seen the movie several times over already. Everything right from the Dialogues to the background Score reminds you of those several "Family Drama" you have seen over the years. A very "correct" Salman doing what is right in the great Indian traditional thinking. The innocent Shilpa Shett who does not know right from wrong or does she. A typical "Modern" mother in law who drinks, smokes and wants her daughter to leave her husband and the quiet father in law who does not speak anything and tolerates everything, to the generous joint family who are willing to forgive and forget. The same old wife wants separate place away from a joint family and a lot of melodrama over a baby. This is a huge waste of time.The title is misleading that it has some elements of comedy but IT DOES NOT. All the jokes (few and far) are pathetic and stale. I could not possibly find anything positive to say about this movie and this is when i was in a very good mood when i went to watch it - it was ruined. Please don't ruin your day by watching it." 
" Sexist, Backward, disgusting and frankly disturbing portrayal of "family" values.","I'd give this movie -10 rating if I could and I'd like to tell you why.
Salman's character hoodwinks Shilpa's character into falling in love with him. The idiotic girl falls in love thinking they are "super compatible" and the 2 get married. The marriage was doomed from the beginning. Why? Let me break it down for you
Salman's character finds Shilpa extremely attractive and that was the end of that. So, instead of trying to win her heart like a normal man and date a while(which if he had tried would have made him realise how truly different the two were) he uses her diary to "reel her in" which apart from being totally manipulative and downright wrong is also a blatant invasion of her privacy. He basically didn't provide her with a chance to choose for herself if she even liked the guy for who he was and yet according to the movie he is the "positive" character.Say we forget or even forgive(which we shouldn't, but for argument sake lets assume we do) the 1st point because he was in "love"(cough *lust* cough) after all. He forces her to quit her career,almost forces her to have a child even when she clearly says she is not ready(which fyi is one of the things which could have been avoided by TALKING OPENLY before the wedding), is not even willing to try being a nuclear family, forces her to deliver a child even as they are getting divorced like she is some sort of rental oven and then when she is ridden with hormones of motherhood and wishes to be with her child he PUNISHES her for her "crimes" of wanting to live away from his joint family( 'you wanted to separate a son from his mother' and whatnot, like SHE didn't leave her family behind. Total misogynistic crap!)Oh but Shilpa's character is no saint either. I'll give her that she was in a clearly vile situation, BUT the rest of the family seemed amiable enough, especially the mother in law. But, NO she has to be stubborn, spoilt, bratty, materialistic and aloof. She didn't even TRY to become a part of his family(not entirely her fault. If only her mother would stop spreading her crap around while her father hangs around like a spineless little toerag. The mother drinks, smokes and treats her husband like a footstool, which in THIS culture is the definition of MODERN!. What b**l S**t!)The cherry on top is their total acceptance of Domestic violence. People go around saying stuff like 'you should smack your woman once or twice a day to keep her under control'. WOW!This movie is made with a clear chauvinistic, backward minded mentality of the dark ages COMPLETELY unworthy of being a part of modern cinema. I myself an a man and if I were to behave like Salman's character in this movie and yet act "holier than thou" like him, I'd deserve to be smacked HARD right across my face!" 
" Sexist and Terrible!","At the beginning, it seemed predictable, but entertaining enough with Salman Khan playing a reasonably decent character and the same with Shipla Shetty. The first half an hour was decent and okay. But then it just tumbled down hill. It started with the wife and husband fights that came with a liberal wife and conservative husband. While the opinions on both sides ranged from reasonable to just outrageous, both characters had their shares of good and bad arguments. But Salaman Khan drew the line when he used the accursed argument, "Because you're a women". It drew a line in the sand and no matter what he did, I would never get that line out of my head. A few major key points in the movie I want to focus on. When Shipla found out she was having a baby and didn't feel ready to be a mother. I thought it was quite interesting that they showed this in a Bollywood movie when it's not often shown in any movie really. But then Salman shows his overbearing and controlling side by foreboding her from having an abortion. So when she falls and has a miscarriage he automatically thinks she had an abortion and is lying. This is important as he from then on accuses her of aborting the baby and no one corrects him! And then it just falls apart. I could go on and on about the flaws, but just trust me. If you watch this movie, it's 3 hours you will never get back!" 
" Interesting but Predictable","I only recommend you watch this film if it comes on T.V and you have nothing to do for 2and a 1/2 hours. It showcases a wide range of skill on Salman Khan's part although his customary topless scene is once again unnecessary as it has been for his last 30+ films. Shilpa Shetty's performance although adequate leaves no lasting reminder. She also needs to remember that when doing night-time scenes she should at least appear to have removed her make-up. The songs were all mis-placed and do nothing to advance the story without one memorable song. The Supporting Cast was very good, although Ahana's mother was very one dimensional throughout the film and her change was unbelievable and plastic." 
" I see this in my family","This is such a true movie. I see this evident in multiple families around me, verbatim. I know the father loves everyone and wants to let them do whatever they want, but that leads to major problems. So if you truly love them, then give true love, don't fall or let others fall. If someone is falling, love is not watching them fall. This is a great family movie that shows that love is not passion, as we think it is today, but its doing what's right for the good of the family unit. True happiness is seeing the other happy, even if they can't see that happiness in the short term. True respect is respecting your elders. The father has a responsibility of love, and this movie accurately portrays the issues if he does not take that responsibility.The only knock I have on this movie is that the patch-up between the quiet father and his wife happens within 15 seconds, it was too quick, looked too forced." 
" Just Okay","This movie begins as a romance, when Ayaan (Salman Khan) meets model Ahana (Shilpa Shetty) and falls in love with her. After finding her diary, he woos and marries her with the help of the information her diary provides. Then themovie becomes a domestic drama, with their marriage on the rocks--with the diary as the apex--and the viewer is left wondering if love will be enough to reconcile them.The plot starts off interesting, but after a while, the arguments become tiresome. The resolution happens too quickly, and is not fully believable. Khan goes from charming to stubborn well, but the viewer will be conflicted as to whether he is in the right. Ahana's character is too spoiled and sullen to be fully likable; whether this is the fault of the actress or the writing is uncertain. There are some quite good songs, but the choreography is below average. Overall, this is an okay movie, but not one I would universally recommend." 
" Salman and Shilpa almost save a stale family drama","'Shaadi Karke Phas Gaya Yaar' falls flat because of some terrible writing. K.S. Adiyaman previously directed 'Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam', and whatever anyone may say, I really liked this movie because of the story, the songs and the star cast. However, this film cannot be saved by neither such aspect. The songs are forgettable, the story is somewhat interesting but the dated script only worsens with every scene. Somehow I managed to go through the film for Salman and Shilpa. They play a newly married couple whose differences make their lives miserable. I am not going to mention anything because I do not support either party and the film actually hardly deals with anything according to me. The dialogues are very poor and at some point pathetic. Had the film been directed by someone else, I believe it would have been a far more watchable fare. Salman Khan looks as though he could not care less about this film. It may be one of the many films he made as a favour to a friend. Shilpa Shetty, however, tries her best. It was a time in her career when she was struggling to at least get a film, and she really did the best of what she was given, though sadly she was not given much. I do not recommend you to watch this film." 
" Stale and frustrating","Well I decided to watch this movie right after I saw Pyaar ke side-effects and was of course expecting something on the same lines here as well. Alas, how could I expect Bollywood to make me happy twice in a row! I was surprised to see the director making such a movie and even if he filmed this, deciding to release it! It appears that this movie is at least 10 years late compared to the present state of Bollywood. Everything, from the songs to the plot, stinks of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, DDLJ, Hum Saath Saath Hain etc.Its amazes me to no extent that directors did not realize that the masses no more want those sob-stories of "Ideal families"! Karan Johar still has been surprisingly doing that job well and this should be left for him to do! The story-line is predictable, songs are early 90's, all in all I regretted watching this movie. It was far from being comic, in contrast to what the name suggested." 
" The Worst Movie","One of the worst films I've ever seen is a distortion of the image of women in society.
A woman is not here to have children for you. She is human and she has life and a future.
She has a dream and wants a job. How dare any human stop her ?" 
" The mundane and the mediocre","This film celebrates the most mundane aspects of middle class Indian life. It is full of petty and mediocre husband and wife fights that go on and on for more than two and a half hours. By the end, you feel like throwing a bomb at the TV screen. I fell asleep in the middle and even had a few drinks to keep me going till the end. The film even tries to pass off eve teasing and heckling as comedy. Shakti Kapoor was quite good as a dour henpecked husband. Salman and Shilpa Shetty sleepwalk through their roles.It is amazing how much Bollywood has changed in the last ten years. A film like this would be torn apart by the critics if it came out today. But I doubt whether this change reflects any major shift in attitudes towards women in Indian society. TV serials a hundred times more regressive than Shaadi Karke Phas Gaye Yaar are still aired on Indian TV channels and eagerly watched by millions. One needs to fear the minds that conceived mediocre films like Shaadi Karke Phas Gaye Yaar." 
" Pathetic, sexist, shallow","Terrible views represented in this movie.Shame on the director and producer.
It is ethically to steal someone's personal journal but not to have freedom of speech or actions, consumption of alcohol. It is right to expect your wife to quit her career and what she likes. Just wow!!! 
It is a woman's choice to have or not have a child. 
Portraying Shilpa's role as completely negative is absolutely wrong. Salman is a complete hypocrite int his movie." 
" The title should be misogyny the movie.","The movie promotes the idea that women are baby making machines that shouldn't be alowed the right to their own bodies and that women shouldn't and should dress modestly.
It also promotes hitting women into submission." 
" Outdated","The promos were on air in 2004 but the film finally released in 2006 and went unnoticed. The film released when Salman was going through a rough phase, his films were flopping at the B.O. The film not only looks straight out of 70s and 80s even the handling is hackeyened. KS Abdhiyaman's last film HUM TUMHARE HAIN SANAM too was a delayed film which was stuck for 6 years The film starts in typical format, boy meets girl, the situations are nothing new, In fact one can easily make out the film was in making for some time. The twist is well handled and some scenes are well handled but the second half does an about turn, the tactics done by Salman and Mohinish look very stupid and the climax too is nothing new.Direction is ordinary Music is okay, some songs are melidious but the delay takes a tollSalman Khan is ordinary in a role he has done many times, he just sleepwalks through his role with hardly any enthusiasm Shilpa Shetty does well in her role Amongst rest most actors are just typecast, Supriya Karnik has done the role so many times that it seems second skin, Shakti Kapoor is alright, Aasif Sheikh is okay too while Mohinish Behl does provide some good moments Reema Lagoo is as usual"
