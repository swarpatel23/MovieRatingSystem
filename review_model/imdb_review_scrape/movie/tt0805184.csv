" A movie that grows on you..","Bhagam Bhag,released in 2006 is a bit ahead of its time and difficult to comprehend first time around.Although,the more number of times you watch this film,the more hilarious it gets.What doesn't work with the audience is the pace and the numerous plotpoints it introduces which can get confusing for some people and back in 2006 it was all about slapstick comedy whereas this movie doesn't belong to that category.Still it caters to that part of a crowd who enjoy no brainers.But if you watch closely all those plotpoints are justified and doesn't feel out of place.In fact it makes a lot of sense!Hence this is one of the very well made films by Priyadarshan which is supported by good writing and epic comic timing from the awesome threesome I.e Akshay Kumar,Paresh Rawal and Govinda.I feel if Bhagam Bhag was in the theatres now,it would've gained wider appreciation only because people have started to understand films much better.They look at all the aspects of what goes in to making a movie and in the case of Bhagam 9 out of 10 are spot on yet I'll rate this an 8 as I don't want to crush the expectations of the viewers.But I highly recommend it to Akshay fans and who like Priyadarshan's way of doing comedy." 
" Much underrated comedy. Critics bashed it then public beg for such movie now.","My actual rating is 7/10 but after seeing other reviews and critics reviews I made it 8. Bhagam bhag is an entertainer of all time. One can't change the TV channel when it's Bhagam Bhag on the screen. Its a film which is connected in all aspects. It needs to be watched with attention and dialogues need to be heard carefully to understand this movie. Each and every scene in this movie is very well acted funny and entertaining. BGM is the powerhouse of this movie its one of the best BGMs of all time. Locations are very nice. Editing is done very well, there is no scene extra. There is no scene you can say why is this in film because everything is interconnected so well. Performances are like when it comes to Priyadarshan Comedies its obvious that you just can't sit without rib tickles by some actors. I will go by order of best performances I felt. Paresh Rawal is master of this film. Manoj Joshi is simply amazing. Then comes Akshay Kumar then Rajpal Yadav, Govinda, Shakti Kapoor, Lara Dutta, Jackie Shroff, Asrani, Sharat Saxena and others. The suspense part of the film is gripping. Comedy starts from starting of the film till the end. The police chase scene is the highlight scene and shows acting class of the actors in that sequence. Climax could have been better. Some scenes you can consider illogical but they are taken in a comic way. Dialogues I would say people haven't heard them well and they are really awesome, appreciable and making us laugh very much. The suspense and Comedy are mixed is a very nice way by the director. And if this is considered lame comedy by critics then Jim Carrey, Mr. Bean and Charlie Chaplin comedies are lame too. It is one of the best comedies ever made. Overall Bhagam Bhag is a joyride and is an all time entertainer by all means." 
" Run with less fun...Bhagam Bhag!","Everybody was damn excited about this film. More than 22 crores of budget, perfect star cast, Priyadarshan and amazing promotions. But Bhagam Bhag doesn't go well compared to all the above mentioned jazz. Govinda is back after a very long time but there is nothing much to do for him! He is the biggest star when you call for an effortless dancing and perfectly framed comedy but look at him in this movie. There's no solo dance no. for him, no perfectly timed comedy and he is looking old and fat. We all know, for Priyadarshan movie, don't use your brain to find out some logic in that movie. You just enjoy the trail-rail of all the comic scenes lined-up just to make you laugh! But here, nothing so great and nothing to title 'perfect comedy'. Akshay Kumar has repeated his same old comic style that has been done and re-done in Hera Pheri, Awara Pagal Deewana, Garam Masala, etc.Still, the movie has lot to offer. The first half is fast and you'll hardly have time to understand what's going on! Govinda still has that charm and Akshay, Raghuvir Yadav, Shakti Kapoor have done justice to there roles. Not to forget, king of all comedies, Paresh Rawal! Doing all villainous roles in his earlier days and now, full-fledged comedian and character artist Paresh has also got his own space to lead some hilarious scenes. To be honest, he could've performed better. Lara Dutta is looking pretty and has some moments.The confusion scenes between our heroes and the funny underworld guys are too hilarious and one of the highlights of the movie. The combo of Govinda and Akshay goes well all together and in spite of lesser footage value to Govinda, they both look funny and equal all together.The music is totally in. The title song, 'Signal' and 'Tere Bin' are major hits already and ruling all the music/ video charts. Though there was some controversy with the music and story of the film. Bhagam Bhag is a re-make of a famous Tamil movie and the producer Sunil Shetty, famous Indian actor, faced a law-suit on not taking the permission before re-making. Sunil ended-up paying 75 lacs to the producers of that original movie. The music director, Pritam, has been charged of copying an English song and using that melody and tune in 'Bhagam Bhag'-the title song. In fact, all of Pritam's so-called original compositions in movies like Dhoom, Gangster, Garam Masala, Apna sapna money-money, Chocolate, Who lamhe, Pyar ke side effects, Fight-club, etc., have been lifted from other international music groups! All said and done, the movie is a good time-pass and watch-able for once. So please, do not hesitate and watch 'Bhagam Bhag' without finding any logic in it!" 
" Brilliant!!! Brainless Comedy Yet Quiet Enjoyable","When there is Akshay Kumar with priyadarshan !!! THAT MUST BE A FUN-FILLED comedy.Well this is One!!! Priyandarshan Came back with a bang with Bhagam Bhag The Long Awaited movie was certainly worth it Priyadarshan is the only director which is the funniest...It's a Very nice movie with lots of Twist and Turns Govinda Looks Stupid as Always He Shouts a Lot than he does acting but he executes his jokes brilliantly!!! but No way is he Better than Akshay. 6/10 Akshay Always Original, straight forward actor The Acting of Akshay was simply Exquisite he should win awards for his comic actings.. 10/10 Lara Dutta, 3 Roles in one film but She is always acceptable, she is easy on the eyes and ears,,,, well not on ears due to her Heaving Voice.. but she Faired Nicely 7/10 Paresh Rawal is only HAHAHAHAHHA with his Attitude and Acting, He is Certainly the Most Funniest Actor around in Bollywood. 9/10 The Movie is Great but Brainless, if you try to understand the Plot of the movie just think thats its a Movie without a PLOT LINE that will be more fun to amaging Go Ahead a Must Watch for Comic-Liking Audience its a Clean Movie watch it with your family!!! The Movie Rating 7/10 but my rating is 10/10 Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan" 
" Quite Enjoyble","First Of All, if you are going to watch this movie because you think it has a plot! And a good thrilling story, then this is not the movie you should watch. But then if you just want to have a good laugh at how miserable can one's life get,(especially in a foreign country) then go in. You'll find this movie enjoyble.Paresh Rawal owns a dance and music performance troupe and is very much in trouble to find a new Heroine for his next show, comes in Akshay Kumar & Govinda. Performances were O.K. But Govinda should now think of retiring from his acting career.(He Was looking aged on screen). Akshay Kumar did well in portraying his role, but the real class was Paresh Rawal. Music by Pritam Was good, but could've been better!The Suspense Plot was only there to Hold the story together, so you need not think about it too much. Just ease in, take your seats, and enjoy this movie with real intentions to enjoy a mindless comedy!! And you won't get Disheartend!" 
" It's a Good movie","Go and Watch it. It's not as bad as it's been portrayed by our friends.When we learn Bhagam Bhag is been directed by Priyadarshan then expectations are too high, but we should understand not every Comedy Flick can make it as big as Hera Pheri.so guys don't expect and watch Bagham Bagh, since it's a OK or i should say Good Movie ( because of some moments in movie ).As every one were expecting this movie to be a rip roaring comedy, since * Akshay, Govinda, Paresh and Directed by Priyadarshan ( Who provided us great comedy hits like Hera Pheri, Hungama ), I was little disappointed when i watched Bhagam Bagh, since Story was not convincing, as he had compromised comedy to murder mystery ( Comedy gets faded at every stage), There are few funny moments to tickle your rib's. Akshay as expected was good with his comedy timing, Govinda was looking too OLD or should i say Horrible, Paresh Rawal didn't had much to act. Lara Dutta has substantial role, she tried to enact well. Jackie role was wasted.Songs are good, Some of the scenes where picked from south Indian movie." 
" Laugh till you die!","Its VERY difficult to make a murder mystery with a comical theme, and priyadarshan created it successfully - perhaps his best film to date. The story revolves around 3 main characters - Govinda and Aakshay who play main leads in Paresh Rawal's theatre group. the group of around 30 strike lucky when they're called to London to perform, but due to Aakshay and Govinda's flirtatious nature they lose the heroine! What follows is the mad search for a heroine, bhagam bhag from police, bhagam bhag from gangsters and bhagam bhag from underworld dons! Govinda's comeback is sweet - only he could portray the character with such excellence, and the reason behind the movie's comic nature is due to mostly him and Paresh Rawal. Rawal, as usual, is gold. His timing is perfect, and sometimes you're on the floor in laughter (for example the bomb joke). Aakshay followed suit with a loverboy/leader attitude, his emotions sometimes made you feel sorry for him, but also laugh as the movie progresses....all in all, a laugh riot, and a thrilling ride keeping you on the edge!" 
" By the forgetful for the forgetful","After three hours in the Cinema hall,the strongest impression garnered was that their is something amiss. What was clear was that the Directors forgot to direct, the actors to act and most importantly the script writer to write. Evervbody shouted without reason and made one cringe. The script moved on and on with lots of avoidable twists and turns ending in now, too familiar Priyadarshan theory of Converging actors at a single point. This theory worked well in Hera-Pheri and Hungama but somehow managed to irritate this time, so did the habit of every actor's incapacity to answer asked of them directly. Simplest questions such as " what is your name would be repeated N times".Finally what was amiss was that the director forgot that his audience have something called intelligence." 
" Thrilling comedy","Govinda may be second hero of this movie but his presence is great. His comic timing is great as usual. Akshay did good also paresh rawal and rajpal yadav done well.
It's of course a movie ahead of its time. In youtube it's released by shemaroo in july 2018 which gained over 12 millions views in 3 months." 
" Run amok in London","Its Priyan movie dude and nothing short of a full time-pass entertainer.Akshay Kumar:: Wherever humanly possible Akki delivers more than 100%. In layman terms, he overacts. If you ignore, with the assumption of signature style, then he is full-two.Govinda:: Makes his presence felt and surprisingly get adequate screen time too, considering the fact he is pitted against Priyan favourites namely "editing notorious" Akki and "cat-o-nine lives" Paresh Rawal. And Sunil Shetty would have been a bad choice definitely.Bunty and Babla? Any references to Bunti & Babli? Sorry just thinking aloud! Lara Dutta:: Doesn't leave any impact, hence its safe to say that she was miscast. And her suicidal tendencies part was not fleshed out adequately. In fact Tanushree Dutta in the cameo was far more convincing.Paresh Rawal:: If you don't expect a reprise of Hera Pheri, he is spot on in its own right. Any deficiencies... blame the writing department.Jackie Shroff:: Its good to see a Priyan's old timer this time around and being London MetPolice Chief is nothing short of creative liberties.Other regulars just chip in with special mention to Rajpal Yadav (spot on!), Sharat Saxena, Manoj Joshi (howls again!) and Asrani.Sorry I forgot about you Arbaaz. Bhagam Bhaag is a remake of Malayalam movie which was sequel to Hera Pheri. As usual Priyan and his team customised the recipe to suit the palette. Needless to say, moving the story-base to London, capturing the English summer and yet not losing sight of the plot has translated into a decent show. And for those who are crying foul, never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal... then." 
" Unfortunate under-rate.","U mutch under rated movie. With a brilliant comedy timing." 
" Another gem from Priyadarshan.","One of the best comedy movies in India. Great story line, great acting especially from Paresh Rawal, great music too. The story grows flawlessly throughout the movie. Comedy scenes are still laughable in 2019. The movie should have been in top charts, it's a shame that it isn't." 
" But...I expected more...!","I saw this with high expectations. Come on, it is Akshay Kumar, Govinda, and Paresh Rawal, who are all amazing at their comedy, I was really hoping for a laugh riot. Sadly, that is not what I got at all...Unfortunately, nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud. There were times when I chuckled at one or two things, but nothing really made me laugh. In short, it was badly attempted comedy, and in a way, a bit of a Hera Pheri wannabe.Out of the three main guys, I think Paresh Rawal's role was the most powerful. It wasn't the biggest role, but it certainly stood out more than Govinda or Akshay. Their performances were okay I guess. Nothing special, just mediocre. Though Govinda stole the limelight from Akshay in more than a few scenes. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also make appearances in this film, and both of them were pretty bad. Lara's role did not move me, or make me laugh, and Tanushree Dutta's character just got on my nerves! The music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag. My favourite song is "Tere Bin", followed by "Afreen", which I really liked. "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag" are also worth a listen.You either will like it or you won't. And judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction, I don't think you will." 
" Nice Sparks but no BLAST!!!","Think of it. Comedy King GOVINDA, Comedy Champ Paresh Rawal & Comedy Star Akshay Kumar. Then Priyadarshan is the Director. What else can you look for, what better combination can you make! Of course expectations have to be high, higher, highest.Bhagam Bhag is a nice movie with lots of its own moments of laughter, some very funny dialogues, nice scenes and beautiful song & music. But is that just enough when we have the Champions around. Don't we expect more, a BLAST may be? Its story of Champak Chaturved (Paresh Rawal) who has a theatre group in India and he performs shows all over the country. Bunty (Akshay Kumar) and Babla (Govinda) are actors in the group who are very naughty natured guys who never miss any chance to flirt with girls, even the girls in the group. They Go to London for a series of show but there heroine runs away. They discover a girl Munni (Lara Dutta), who suffers from amnesia to act in their drama and just as Bunty and Munni fall in love, her memory returns and it brings chaos into their lives, including a murdered husband! A series of funny event start which lead to an unexpected climax. Initially it seems Arbaaz & then the Commissioner (Jackie Shroff) who is behind all the mystery which further leads to strange ending.So its an OK movie with OK storyline & concept. Of course all of these are not major elements of a Priyadarshan movie. The major element is laughter, which doesn't seem as strong and powerful here. Akshay, Paresh & of course Govinda rock & roll. It's a nice come back for Govinda but again it could have been better. Same with the whole movie.Priyam Sir, we expected more, a lot may be..." 
" Could it BE more tasteless?","Rs.30/- is all I paid as rent for the DVD of the movie and believe me it is not worth it.Bollywood directors think that showing fools is funny? well it is not. Please grow up.Here goes a dialog from the movie -'AGAR TUM LADKEE KO IJJAT DOGE TO LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI'.Plot is useless, criminals and police alike running after fools. That is it. BHAGAM BHAG.Well it lived the title, I had to run away from it. :) I switched over to Star Movies and watched Home Alone 2 instead, and had a good laugh." 
" A Chase Worth Missing out on","This movie is crazy. Now that's acceptable for a comedy but what is Priyadarshan trying to do.Though he is quite innovative in creating a few scenes - on the whole he fails miserably in delivering a well packaged ride. I saw this movie albeit after a delay and expected a lot. After all getting to see Govinda join the fun-fare and great promos of the movie were very promising.But it turned out to be a damp squib. The director fails miserably to conjure up the magic of 'Hera Pheri,' and this time around he seems to have totally lost the plot.Govinda is wasted since even the best actor requires a script, Akshay Kumar is passable and does what's necessary, Paresh Rawal is nowhere half as humorous as he was portraying Baburao Ganpatrao Apte (Hera Pheri- 2000), the females are there to be forgotten.The plot or what little there is to it, revolves around the desi stage troupe of Champak Chaturvedi (Paresh Rawal). His lead pair is Bunty (Akshay) and Babla (Govinda). The troupe gets its best break when Asrani offers them a chance to tour London for a month. Alas the heroine (Tanushree Datta) runs away having had enough of these two who keep coming on strong.So the troupe reaches London and the chase begins to find a leading lady. Akshay meets up and enlists Lara Dutta despite her suicidal tendencies and affinity to fling herself before speeding cars. Crazy enough hold on.It gets crazier with these two getting all mixed up with criminals thinking them to be the police and vice-versa  plus there are a few local goons headed by Shakti Kapoor who is also after them to extract revenge for his fractured limbs. Rajpal Yadav is good as a taxi driver and Jackie Shroff struts along occasionally as the local police chief.Hold on there is still something more, this chase gets now real complicated with a murder mystery attached to it. This comes across as a real spoiler... and I need not say more. Left the way it is a crazy senseless chase with all the misconceptions, the movie shows promise with funny moments to tickle the audience and dialogues to boot. But this mystery angle comes along and simply spoils everything.Sanjay Dutt is supposed to have a guest appearance so watch the first 30 minutes closely.. I for one sure missed out on him. And for some reason the climax seems inspired from - It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963) Once done with, I am confused whether to call it a comedy or a tragic comedy. Watch it in the theatre if you really have nothing better to do. Or else wait for the DVD release and watch it at home better still borrow it  cause though this chase is humorous on occasions  most of the time it gets to you with its unnecessary complexities and simply not worth spending much on."
