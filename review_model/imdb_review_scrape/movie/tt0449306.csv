" cute time pass","I thought the movie was unpretentious , cute and enjoyable!! It didn't want to be a masterpiece and I'm OK with that. Salman acted quiet well and has good comic timing, moreover, he looks better with age! A thespian he isn't but is pretty tolerable in movies like this .Sneha was really cute and has that special something about her on screen, her acting was not much to write home about, but then her character didn't require much acting either . She has screen presence, evident even in a movie like this, and more so than I expected from the promos. Mithun- he was funny @ times( when parodying old Hindi film dialogs), although he was OTT too!The songs were VERY well picturised, the romantic moments between the lead pair were well done with requisite amounts of angst and didn't leave one with an uneasy feeling at all ( despite the age gap). They had good chemistry together on screen . The cinematography was awesome, the screenplay was OK in parts. There was suspension of disbelief involved but a good movie( like this one) should make the viewers WANT to suspend disbelief rather than make them irritated. The movie was well directed on the whole .All in all, a nice 2 hours 17 minutes at the cinema.." 
" A decent movie for Salman & Mithun fans; a passable one for the rest.","'Lucky' is not a description, but the name of the female lead in the movie. So much has been written about her looks, Salman Khan's involvement in casting her and the likeness to another blue-eyed beauty from Bollywood that more than anything, it creates a curiosity in Bollywood-followers to watch the movie. A sneaky publicity campaign in the hope of a larger audience? I think so... But the movie itself is not void of any entertainment value. On the contrary, I found ducking into a cinema to watch this movie as quite a wonderful way to get out of traffic on the drive home.The titular Lucky, as played by débutante Sneha Ullal, is a humble poetry-loving High School student studying in St. Petersburg, Russia. She lives there along with her younger sister & parents - her Dad works at the Indian Embassy. Although an acheiver of good marks, she mis-reads her time-table and ends up studying for a wrong exam. Before leaving home on the fateful day, she prays to God "Please let there be no Exam today". God listens to this favoured disciple in the form of an unexpected wave of insurgency in the Russian city and neighbouring areas, causing the entire area to become a playground for bullets. Caught in-between, she bumps into Aditya (Salman Khan), the son of the Indian Ambassador, and the two take-off into the wilderness for survival. The rest of the movie has us follow the pair as they make their way through woods, poison, army camp, frozen desert, crowded trains, etc - towards their families. Mithun Chakraborty plays an Intelligence Officer (a Colonel, no less) hired by the Ambassador (Aditya's papa) to rescue our hero & heroine.In tune with Pyar Kiya to Darna Kya, the Khan brothers have again made a movie watchable with the entire family. A very clean and soft movie that has its share of mushy moments, a bit of comedy and a few action sequences. The movie is a little longer than required (especially in the second half), yet does not get boring in any of its parts. Add to that the beautiful scenics of St Petersburg, and you get the equivalent of a summer date-movie for couples fighting off the heat-wave in India.Salman Khan is his new usual self, acts in a few scenes, jokes in most, fights in some. He is beginning to look old, & maybe he realizes that and plays on it in the movie. Mithun Chakraborty does a 'love him' or 'hate him' turn - and I loved him. This man has a style of his own - and if you have watched his earlier movies (80s), you may laugh, clap and whistle to your heart's content in his sequences, as I did This movie marks the debut of four people. #1 - Sneha Ullal, the Aishwarya look-alike is a little more than just that - not only does she have the beautiful wide-eyes of the beauty but she is an actress of the same degree, i.e., Zero. Yet, for the part that she plays - a naive and super-innocent school-girl with only dreams in her eyes, she is watchable. It's a trend in Popular Indian Cinema to let non-actors make their debut and watch movie after movie of theirs while they learn acting before your very eyes. You just need to look good. And this girl does look cute. But it can get quite tiring when made to stare at her for so long. Also, she looks more like an adopted child than a gene-member of the family her character lives with in the movie.#2 & 3 are Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru - the directing duo who graduate from Music Videos to Big Screen. As with the director of Karam, these people know how to capture a movie visually, but show their mark only in short sequences of set-pieces. They walk and trip their way through the movie, but thankfully more of the former than the latter. Yet, they could have avoided the whole Kader Khanroutine (an Indian Doctor with Russian kids) - which ends up being a complete waste.#4 is Adnan Sami as Music Director for a motion picture. He does a wonderful job, and provides beautifully woven melodious numbers that go very well with the movie. None of the songs stick out, but rather blend into the narrative. The opening Asha Bhosle song "Hai Rama Rama" & the Adnan Sami & Lata Mangeshkar duet "Shayad Yehi To Pyaar Hai" stand out among all the good songs as the better ones. But the music director for the background score messes up quite a bit. 'Blaring' is a word that comes to mind.All in all, a decent movie for Salman & Mithun fans; a passable one for the rest.My rating ---> 3 of 5" 
" Promising new directors","I must start with the admission that the Only reason I wanted to watch this film was my curiosity...I needed to know what Salman Khan's home production would do with an Aishwarya dupe. The movie was fine, I rated it 6/10 ****Spoilers!!**** The movie was sharply edited, the story crisp. Expect some clichés, tried-n-tested stock characters and weepy maudlin scenes. I liked the impeccable cinematography and tiny new twists to the familiar story line. For instance: its about Indians abroad but thank heavens, it does not move to Punjab half-way through; no seedy and pointless villains; no discomforting jingoism; the protagonist Adi (Salman) does not spout odiously saccharine lines from the start; he (thank god) does not have that mandatory scene with the girl's mum and neither's parents are dead-set against the lovers.Basically a school-girl fantasy come true, I expect the girls back home will make it a hit. I was leery about an obviously aging, haggard, lived-a-rough-life Salman paired with a girl (Sneha Ullal) who looks like a school kid. However both were at ease with each others roles, the supporting cast was adequate.I would like to make a mention of the fact that while the movie itself was not a fabulous, criterion collection material, I felt the Directors did a good job in presenting it. It's a well-made product. The story was told well, the cast did a reasonably good job, it looked great! I'll keep an eye out for their next one. And Oh, Sneha Ullal does bear an uncanny resemblance to Aishwarya Rai, her make-up and wardrobe were clearly chosen carefully to enhance that effect.As far as subliminal messages go, to a bollywood gossip enthusiast, there were many things to read between the lines. When they first meet, the girl insists she doesn't have a boyfriend, she isn't "that kind of a girl" and so on, to which the protagonist replies in a very jaded manner...yes, I've heard that before. When she then asks him to trust her, he says..."bharoosa kiya". Hmmm, in Hindi that could either mean, I trust you or I had trusted you. Wheee, my gossipy heart rejoiced...just as I had hoped. Later she berates him for not knowing how to talk to a girl. To paraphrase he says, "Well, I say...it was my fault, bye". Ahem! I will say this, one could not but notice, the Protagonist never once expressly declares his love for the girl, even right at the end. The story teases it out and one is left to fill in the blanks. I'll leave the rest for fellow enthusiasts to discover." 
" Fantastic movie","Excellent music and wonderful display of maturity development overnight. A great cast and can't wait for the soundtrack. The on-location scenery was true-to-form. The new star, Sneha, will have a bright future in the movie industry. She displayed just the right amount of shy, early womanhood blossoming to love another. Salman Khan does his normal standout performance. I am touched by the symbolism shown in many Hindi movies of duality. You will see many touching scenes that are later repeated by the opposite party, and to great effect. This is one reason that a movie like this must be viewed several times to get the full impact of it. The music was both modern and thrilling in its melody. The plot developed quickly and maintained interest throughout." 
" Fun, romantic teen flick","This was a nice, feel-good film that comes as a breath of fresh air. Adnan Sami has done an outstanding job with the music! All of the songs have been picturized beautifully. Aankhein Bharlo does a nice job of fusing the ambiance of the Russian czar era with the grace of India. Sun Zara portrays Salman's hope. Chori Chori is set in a storeroom that evokes the tale of the Princess and the Pea. Ek Ajnabi captures the captivating Siberian desert. Lucky Lips is a fun song, and the remix, which doesn't feature in the movie, is really cool. All songs are very melodious and enjoyable. As one can tell from the promos, Sneha Ullal is not much more expressive than a zombie. She's lucky that her role required her to be pretty much a zombie. One can really tell that she's very camera shy. Salman Khan did a great job, and it is nice to see him after such a long gap. Cinematography is magnificent as it captures not just the majestic Russian tundra and landscape, but also the Russian culture, values, and political climate. There is not much of a story as this movie doesn't really require one. It's a run-for-your-lives type of film with Salman and Sneha trying to dodge the terrorists and falling in love in the process." 
" unusual Hindi movie","I watched this movie when it first came out as a teenager and loved it: it as my fantasy come true, beautiful to look at, had an awesome musical score and starred Salman Khan which pretty much guaranteed my bias toward it!! Watching it again today I have a newfound appreciation for it as a unique film (for the industry it was made in at least) and as a good film, in fact it is now officially one of my favourites.The film is unusual for Hindi cinema in the sense that its plot driven (a more Hollywood feature) as opposed to emotionally driven. Hindi films seem to take a lot from Romanticism ideals with the plot being driven by the larger than life characters irrational and spontaneous emotions. Lucky is thus a distinguished film: the two protagonists are if anything ordinary, thrown into extra-ordinary circumstances which bring out their emotions and eventually changes them.This brings me to another point; its is difficult to put this film into any genre at all, it balances between action and romance. I personally think of it as a fairytale following the journey of two characters during which they come to mean something very special to one another.Seeing as the love story was not the dominating focus and very subtle I can see why the Indian audience was not very receptive to the film. It's not a "masala" film as one would expect a Salman Khan film to be: yes its mounted on a grand canvas, has commercial music and is peppered with some masala moments (they don't detract from the film)but the emotion typically depicted in Hindi films is not there in a melodramatic fashion and has to be actually looked for and pondered.The film makes great use of a fairytale motiff, once again unusual for a Hindi film and will go over the top of a viewers head if they are unfamiliar with fairy tales. There is great use of symbology with what characters say at the beginning being repeated toward the end and a very subtle link between the songs Aa ke bharlo and Chori Chori.Salman khan gives an awesome performance, very subtley mainly through his expressions showing the change that comes about in the very charming character of Aditya Sekhri. Sneha Ullal acts well, i'll admit her crying scenes left me in want (one star off) but overall for a newcomer completely foreign to the industry she does well and suits the character to the tee, however the change that comes about in her character Lucky is seen more through action than her expression.As its already been established the cinematography is brilliant. The music topped the charts with good reason but is enhanced by its placement in the film or rather the songs enhance the film; not a single song sticks out. The direction is great and the film is well edited with nothing seeming unnecessary or prolonged.The action of the film begins with "Ghar chale" and ends with it also, but the two characters are not the same at the end. As Salman Khan described the film is about growing up; not just for Lucky but for Aditya also. I personally enjoyed watching the characters grow up under the pressure of the circumstances: Aditya blossoms from a selfish "manchild" of sorts into a sensitive man watch when he offers to beg the doctor and you'll know that he hasn't done it for anyone else but Lucky whilst Lucky blossoms from the shy dreamer into a young woman; another standout and symbolic scene where she embraces her childhood in the form of the child and her subsequent escape from the train is something she initially would not have done alone.On a ending note there's quite a fuss about whether Aditya actually loved Lucky. The expression on his face said it all during that embrace (now by best cinematic hug!!)and in fact his expressions and actions all throughout the movie said it all! The fact that he didn't vocalize it only makes the film all the more special as does the ambiguous ending," 
" You must have right sort of expectations for such films (small spoiler)","I found it very enjoyable. Why? Because unlike some people who left negative comments here, I never took the story seriously. With Bollywood films, you can't. Most of them are fantasy and should be seen as such. Stunning landscapes, good looking actors and actresses, nice music... what else do you need? It was interesting for me to see how people from other cultures portray my homeland. Much friendlier than Hollywood does, by the way! I don't think at all that this film was in any way racist. Yes, the rapist was Russian, and so what? If we are honest, just try to go alone in a park in a big modern Russian city - how many chances are there that nothing will happen to you? Most of us wouldn't chance it (Russia wasn't always like that, but that's another story). SPB (St. Petersburg) is well known for racist attacks at present, so the film was a lot prettier on this issue that it could have been. I must say though I had to laugh when one moment it was summer in the film and the next moment - deep snow all around, and again the next moment- summer again! But it didn't spoil the overall impression." 
" Sneha is too cute.....","I love Sneha Ullal, Watch Lucky! for Sneha Ullal. She is the best part of the movie with her childish looks and voice which is both different and refreshing. She makes you fall in love with her. She looks not only like Ash but has a resemblance with many other faces...she is like your next door girl. Salman is good and frank as are the rest of the cast. There is no story.....only Sneha to watch out for........... Lucky is a good time-pass. Go and watch it. The songs are good and melodious. The directors have done a good job in selecting Russia as the background which has a lot of breathtaking scenes. The sea of snow, the buildings facing the sea are all fabulous." 
" An epoch-making movie.","Gang,I went to see this movie in Columbus, OH with my good friend, Ankur who is a huge Sallu-fan, with a boat-load of expectations. So did the film match up to our expectations ? Yes & No... mostly yes.. Read on..The movie is definitely a ground-making event in Indian cinema. Check out the breath-taking locales, the gasp-inducing grand palaces, the beautiful costumes, the heart rending scene with the poisoned Sneha & a distraught Salman, the jam-packed Soviet-era steam engine train shot, hell even the graveyard looks stunning in this movie!The visuals are just fantastic, the music is super-cool, Sneha looks good and finally Salman looks dapper & acts great too . The movie only reaffirms the superstar status of Salman. He has taken a risk with this movie by playing his age but it pays & how! Your heart will follow Lucky through the tumultuous times she goes through in the movie. The Sun Zara song with its melodious music in the background and the haunting visual of a funeral procession scene has left a permanent imprint in my memory. Both me & Ankur agreed that a strong climax, maybe with apna Sallu giving up his life saving his much younger love, would have raised the movie to a whole new level and probably given it cult status like Tere Naam.Sneha is better than Ash in many areas, given a chance she can out-do Ash at acting. Thumbs up to Sallu for discovering such an enormous talent for Bollywood.The only sorry points in this otherwise great movie are Mithun-da & the weak climax. Still Definitely worth watching a couple of times.Go for it guys!Highly Recommended **********" 
" Okay","This film wasn't what i thought it would be, in terms of i thought that it would be another bollywood flop. I was definitely wrong, as salman khan made a great appearance, i certainly thought that his acting recently has improved dramatically, he's funny, charming as well a serious actor. Although the lady actress is the main character in the movie, salman khan seems to be carrying her throughout the film, he does most of the talking and she listens. The action stunts in the movie was truly surprising, the directors did a pretty good job in making the stunts look like a Hollywood film, so a big pat on the back for those Asian directors, they have definitely come a long way. Overall a movie worth watching." 
" Lucky - A Lovable Watch!","Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's 2005 flick 'Lucky - No Time For Love' is classy film. A charming entertainer, coupled with fabulous direction, silk editing, good performances and ear-pleasing music score. Lucky has its share of minuses, but lets the give the markers its due, a well-made film in all aspects. Lucky proved Lucky for its distributors at the box office and was one the biggest openers of the year. Lucky, from my side, without a doubt gets a Thumbs Up!Pluses: The film has been directed beautifully, the locations are breath-taking. The film's script is cute and well executed. The film's music is a Brownie point. Adnan Sami has done a splendid job. Good performances. Mithun Chakraborty continues his magic with Lucky. He plays the role of the intelligent officer to perfection. Salman Khan is a scene stealer. He's superb. Sneha Ullal gets her job right. Kader Khan, Ravi Baswani and Vikram play to the gallery.Minuses: The film begins slow, and takes time to come to the point.on the whole 'Lucky - No Time For Love' is an entertaining film. Watch it." 
" Watch out for newcomer Sneha and Adnan's music.","Plot Outline: Schoolgirl Lucky (Sneha Ullal) and Indian Ambassador in Russia's son Aditya (Salman Khan) meet by accident in what turns out to be one of the most risky days of their lives as they battle insurgency in finding their way back home to safety.Comment: The Russian locales such as the buildings in St. Petersburg, the graveyard, the train and snow make the movie look like a fairy tale. The story is predictable and the twists get funny at times. When I first saw the promos with Sallu carrying a lifeless and expressionless Sneha and the sub-title "No time for love", I thought that that the movie is love story with a terminally ill girl. Thankfully, this is not the story anyways.Salman acts his age and looks decent. Newcomer and much publicized Ash-look-alike Sneha looks sweet but devoid of life. Hope Sneha's next movie will put some life in her. Mithun Chakraborthy is a sad bondage to the movie. Adnan Sami's music is fresh and 'Lucky Lips' is a must for your mp3 player.Rating: 2/5  Watch out for newcomer Sneha and Adnan's music." 
" Songs are quite impressive","Songs are quite impressive, movie sequence is good especially liked the way street war/fight shown. Gun shooting sound looks realistic. There is violence in this movie but tolerable. Salman's acting is as usual like a kid, but no overacting hence not boring. Sneha looks like carbon copy of Aishwarya Rai. She looks beautiful but as per her roll she remains like a school girl. Mithun acted quite well but he looks more of joker than intelligence officer. Only thing I disliked is the conversation in Rassian language, at least they should have put subtitles in the movie. Since there are no subtitles, couldn't understood the situations well. Anyway overall movie is quite good and songs too. In songs Adnan Sami has continued his regular tuning and stretched emotions in songs. But "Chori Chori" songs change mood, Sonu Nigam and Alaka Yagnik sung these songs very well. Hope to see Sneha in future movies with much more better appearance." 
" Lucky: a waste of time","God... to finish this movie to the end was a real struggle...One issue that strikes me as odd in quite a few Bollywood movie is racism...which is the case in this one too...I don't know but in India so many people are always complaining about racism in other countries but when watching the movies I feel they are more racist as movies from other countries:In Lucky, it's the mean Russian rapist In Dil Chahta Hai, it's the thief in disguise of a beautiful Western woman In Salaam Namaste, it's the available two-bit floozie In Dil Jo Bhi Kahey, it's the staunch racist...Anyway...it just strikes me as odd." 
" Sneha Ullal + Songs","This is my first review, so I hope it's OK.Lucky is the story of Lucky (Sneha Ullal), a quiet schoolgirl living in Russia. While going to school one day, she wishes with all her heart that school is stopped for the day. In a twist, her wish is fulfilled but in such a way that she never thought of. A battle between rebels break out and Lucky is caught between them. She meets Aditya (Salman Khan) who tries to help her come home. Because, they have to avoid the rebels and face the bitter cold and yet go home safely, there is "No Time For Love".Sneha Ullal is fantastic, stupendous, and tremendous. She really made an impact on me and I really wanted to see her. Her acting, mannerisms, dialogues and above all, voice was as cute and sweet as anything. Excelling in the role of a shy, innocent girl, she is the new girl of Bollywood.Salman Khan does a good performance but does nothing spectacular. His expressions are good however and he still has a lot left in him.Mithun Chakrobarty acts wonderfully but his character is not really right. He shouldn't have been made a intelligence officer at all.The songs rock. Each and every song sounds melodious. My favourite is "Lucky Lips". The other songs are good as well.All in all, Lucky is a good time pass movie. Watch it only to see Sneha Ullal, if not anybody else. 7/10" 
" Actually pretty creepy...","So I don't know how the rest of the reviewers are able to get over how damn creepy this movie comes off as. Lucky is 17 supposedly but seemingly acts like she's 12 and it's so cringe worthy to see an old guy like Salman Khan going after her... That's a pretty crazy thing and on the face of it sort of reminds me of Nishabd (which handled this topic SOO much better). It almost feels like it's pandering to immature boys with schoolgirl fetishes. And having it set in Russia I'd think maybe there's a reference to Lolita but this just seems creepy"
