" Best comedy of the year so far!! Hilarious","Phir Hera Pheri, the sequel to the most endearing cult-comedy of our times has released. I managed to watch it at a paid preview and here is my appraisal of different elements of the movie:Paresh Rawal as Baburao: Of course you start with him. Baburao is the real hero of the movie. Baburao Ganpatrao Apte is one of my (I think a lot of people will agree with me here) all-time favorite screen characters and Paresh currently one of the best actors around. The way he says "Devaa Devaa, Utalerey", only he can do it. He gets most of the best punchlines and as expected delivers them flawlessly. Whenever he is on screen, which he is most of the times, the smile hardly fades from your face. He overshadows all flaws in the movie and any blemishes from others. Outstanding work by Paresh Rawal!! What an actor! Rating Â– AAkshay Kumar as Raju: Another fantastic job by him. He is fast becoming the new age comedy icon (if he has already not). There is never a dull moment with him around and he is just getting better with each film. After Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Garam Masala another knockout performance by him. Check him out when he says "Haaye Mujhe Sharm Aati Hai" or in the maze scene during climax (which is a laugh riot) or the way he addresses Rimii with different names. Well done. Rating Â– ASuneil Shetty as Shyam: He is the quintessential action guy who is trying his hand at other roles. His comedy roles like in Hera Pheri, Hulchul, Awara Pagal Deewana have been OK. He is not really that great an actor at comedy (On second thoughts in any role) but still somehow manages to hold his own. Here also he holds his own, but he needs to improve somehow or will be reduced to playing inconsequential character roles (irrespective of whether you change the spelling of your name or not). Here he is fine and actually some of his shortcomings are overshadowed by others. Rating Â– B+Johnny Lever as Munna: One of the most popular comedians ever but he has not been in form in recent times. Here he is back in form as Munna a small time crook who wants to be big by robbing his earlier master. Some of his dialogues are funny. Only problem, his character could have been etched better. Rating Â– B+Rajpal Yadav as Pappu: Another current favorite. Problem he does get much scope to prove his ability, but he has his moments. Rating Â– BBipasha and Rimi: They don't get much scope at all. Bipasha looks hot throughout but I think that is what she was required to do as her acting skills are ahemÂ…Rimi on the other hand looks lost. Anyway not much was expected from their characters. Rating Â– BSharad Saxena as Tiwari: Amazing performance!! As "Totla Tiwari" he is riot. He is the don whose money is conned (it's too complicated to explain here) and he expects our heroes to give it back. His character can't talk properly and his scenes with Baburao make you laugh your guts out. Rating Â– AThere are a host of comedians in the movie. But most of the others don't get much scope as this is entirely the story of Baburao, Raju and Shyam. Suresh Menon (Munna's spy in Nanjibhai's camp) and Manoj Joshi (Kachra Seth) are very good. Rating Â– B+ Bhojpuri superstar and one time Hindi film hero Ravi Kissen as Tiwari's henchman is also good Rating Â– B+ Dinesh Hingoo, Milind Gunaji, Razzak Khan are OK. Sunil Pal is wasted. The gorilla and the "man with no visible head" (or Qutb Minar as Akshay puts it) are fun.Dialogues: Special mention for the dialogues. This movie has some fantastic dialogues. I won't spoil the fun by mentioning them here. Rating Â– AMusic: Himesh Reshammiya can do no wrong currently. Aye Meri Zohrajbeen is a fantastic number and the video is, you've all seen it on music channels, fantastic. The others songs are time pass.Director: Satish Kaushik was supposed to do this movie but he pulled out and Neeraj Vora the writer has directed this. Considering his previous accomplishment as director (Khiladi 420 anyone), this is an amazing achievement. He has improved by leaps and bounds. It is never easy to direct a comedy that too a sequel and make a good job of it. A sequel always has to endure comparisons to the first part. This is not just another comedy but a sequel to Hera Pheri whose characters have now achieved cult status. There is never a dull moment. The movie moves at a very fast pace which gives you no time to brood over what is happening. Just enjoy the happenings as it is. What a job by Neeraj in this movie. Rating Â– AThe movie has some amazing performances and dialogues. There are some references to the first part like the song "Golmal Hain Bhai Sab Golmal Hai" in the background or the "Dhoti Utaale" scene. But it is still enjoyable. Certain characters could have been avoided. One jarring note was the climax. I didn't like most of it much but people around me were in splits, maybe it was beyond my sensibilities. It will no doubt be compared to the first part. Some will like it and some will not. But don't let the comparisons deter you from watching the best comedy of the year so far. Overall, it is complete time pass. Rating Â– B+The way the movie ends leaves scope for another sequel (Maybe called "Ek Aur Hera Pheri). Can't have enough of Baburao, Raju and Shyam, so bring it on.Appraisal Rating Definitions: A -- Fantastic/Excellent B+ -- Very Good B -- Good B- -- OK C -- Poor" 
" One OF The Best Comedy Movie Of All Time","GREAT GREAT Movie I Literally Burst Out OF Laughing Great Acting By All Of The Cast Specially THE Great Comedian We Have Its AKSHAY KUMAR PARESH RAWAL The Chemistry Between Three OF Them Was Superb It Will Definitely Change The Comedy Tradition IN India The Script,Direction,Cinematography,Editing,Techniqule Part And All The Cast And Crew Worked Really Hard For The Movie I Will Ensure That If You WIll WAtch THis Movie OVer And Over You Will Never Get Bored Of The Movie"
