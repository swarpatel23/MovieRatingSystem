" "Hum sab system ka hissa hain. System decide karta hai. Apun follow karta hai."","I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite "Company" (which was a very good effort) and "Vaastav" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya.When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself "Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now". The quote by Nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film. What strikes you about the "encounter" at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out. There is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine.Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted. With simple shots and camera angles, director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie. Editing seems non-existent and hence effective. The music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall.But for me, what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character. Sandeep Srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer. If I start listing my favourite dialogues, I'm afraid I'll end up re-writing the entire script of the movie.The movie boasts of some stellar performances. Yashpal Sharma is detestable as Sub-Inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and so is Jeeva as Joint Commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as the rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster  Oh My God! He learns under the tutelage of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believes in him.Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing. Never before in Indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster.Not that I have not been a fan of Nana Patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I've ever seen in Hindi cinema. From the way he talks to his expressions, from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea  it's almost as if Nana can do no wrong. He is at his best in each and every scene especially when he's teaching Jatin about how the police force functions. His cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times. His dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country. It's a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one.Last but in no way the least, Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there, Amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment. I just hope that he continues the great work and doesn't give in to Bollywood-isation! If he can do that, I'm sure he'll be a force to reckon with in the coming years." 
" The most definitive film on cops","It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV film. Dead straight dialogues, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and superb performances (even by those with little job to do in the movie). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. And so are the small events like an insider not giving information to Imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker, but only to Nana when he is out. The change in working conditions with the change of the senior is dealt wonderfully. The first half keeps one absolutely engrossed, moving like a documentary with Nana acting like a mentor to Jatin explaining to him the intricacies and philosophy of the work.Overall one of the most brilliant films on cops in Indian cinema. Definitely not to be missed." 
" Great movie","An excellent movie and a definite must see. Great plot, screenplay, direction and cast - with just the right amount of Nana. Goes to show that Bollywood can produce movies of cinematic brilliance second to none. I saw shades of Training Day in the beginning of this movie (corrupt cop showing the ropes to a rookie cop), but the similarities ended there. IMHO, Nana did a way more credible job than Denzel's overhyped and overrated Oscar winning performance. A very serious and realistic movie, but not very dark and it did not treat the subject with a heavy-hand. I think this was why the movie moved along at a good pace, and always kept the viewer involved. Gets bonus points for having a white person on screen that can actually speak English [if you've heard white people speak English in Hindi movies, you know what I'm talking about]. A very solid 9/10." 
" Fictional story based on a very real cop...","No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a real "encounter" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead "Sadhu Agashe" has killed" - well you already know that bit)Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. THe one liners are just hilarious. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Another one of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory. Movies which are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan meanders close to very good. But yet remains one of the Top 70 films released from India, commercial and artsy included.What is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally (in an Indian flick) how the police network works. The cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell (though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny) The producers are trying for a Cannes release, which is interesting. Made by debut director Shamit Aman (i think thats his name).Again 55 y.o. Nana Patekar is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past, just shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief.
Again Patekar is the guy who happilly carries the movie on his shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie- relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. Good dialoges, good acting, nice direction all in all Great stuff. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma's Company (both Indian flicks)" 
" Great movie and Exceptionally good acting","I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines. One exception for this is Ramgopal Verma movies. This is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast. This is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories. The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai cop Daya Naik this movie deals in a more realistic way. The film delves into the life of the common man, which he has apart from being an encounter specialist. I rate this as one of the best movie of the year" 
" Nana Patekar steals another movie","Nana Patekar once again proves that he is the best actor working in Bombay without a doubt. His recent movies involved shouting his lines that does not bode well for the theater trained thespian. One wonders why he  is always not given his accolades during awards season."Shakti-The Power" was one of his flicks that was an utter disapointment along with Kohram (a missed oppurtunity to create screen magic with Amitabh Bachchan).But Patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of social justice journey. Ridding the streets of Bombay of underworld dons in fake encounters, Patekars character takes control of the screen (and the viewers attention) and never lets go. The editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story.Along the same lines as the modern day cult classic "Company", the movie is well acted, directed and should have a long shelf life on DVD.
The final ten minutes that see Nana and the main villain talk at his offshore haven are bound to be part of Hindi cinema classics. Won't be dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick." 
" Oscar material from India!!","This is by far one of the best films that India has ever made. Following are the plus points of the film...Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent.Even though the film shows the life of Mumbai Policemen and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic.Mind-blowing acting by lead actor Nana Patekar. One can surely hope that he gets nominated for the Best actor for the academy awards.Controlled violence. The violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess.No stupid songs as in usual Indian movies." 
" one the best films RGV has produced","I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was. Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen. I have not seen Naach as yet but I am looking forward for it. I for some reason don't find Antra Maali that exciting to watch on the screen - unlike Urmila." 
" Absolutely stunning performance from Nana Patekar","Breathtaking performance & an app-laudable achievement for Nana Patekar is Ab Tak Chappan.Shimit Amin brings to us the most definitive cop movie Indian Cinema has seen after a long time.The movie shares the relation between underworld & police on screen.As well as one man commitment to his job as well as to other things.Dialog Delivery of Nana Patekar is sensational.Rest of the casting is perfect.Finesse though i think is added by Prasad Purandhare as Zameer.His acting & his dialog delivery seriously collides with the brilliance of Nana.Superb performance by him.This movie has no songs so this gives a Hollywood kind of an atmosphere.Dialog delivery are stupendous.The ending & the last conversation of Inspector Sadhu Agashe & Zameer just makes your day.Totally amazing ending.Also to go along slight soundtrack like the voice of great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan just adds that extra spice.There is no limit on what frequency i see this.Mostly when i have nothing to do,i switch on my DVD player just to see this movie.Definitive entertainment focusing on the nexus of police & underworld." 
" HITHERTO 56","Shimit amin, the new grad,drop out or student of the so called RGV school of film making has done a commendable job with this movie.His direction has been absolutely immaculate.The director had succesfully managed to keep the tempo of the movie very gripping without diluting it with songs,or offtracking the movie as we had seen happening umpteen number of times in BOLLYWOOD.It has been quite a favorite situation for BOLLYWOOD to provide the cop an unforgetting moment like losing his lady love and the protagonist is made to avenge out of that emotional setback.This is where this movie stands out from the rest of the BOLLYWOOD COP MOVIES.The conversation between sadhu and the main bad guy living overseas ends up being the best scene reflecting the plottings and counter psychological plottings that get weaved between the cops and the underworld for gaining their respective supremacy .The lighter moments  shared amongst the cops(like commenting on shoaib akhtar)were dealt with utmost aplomb.all in all a very good movie to be watched.i definitely recommend this for international viewers." 
" Close Encounter of the Good Cinema Kind.","Nana Patekar, the "Morgan Freeman" of Indian Cinema, has given some great perfs. as a village head in "Shakti", a mute in "Khamoshi". No one with an eye for good acting can miss the brilliance of this performer. A good script,a good supporting cast like Revathi, Yashpal Sharma, a crisp editing and direction makes this movie a winner. There are some great scenes and dialog-like when he first meets Zameer and explains him the "nuisance value," when he invites his subordinate for dinner and cooks "Sambar". The movie is dominated and sustained by Patekar, who takes you into the web of underworld-deceit,deception and corruption which may border on exxageration at some point but the outline to some extent is real life dilemma faced by the law enforcement. The word "Encounter" is a misnomer but it is accepted as most accept the word "Bollywood". Any movie that can hold your interest with one actor and a clever dialog is a good movie and coming from an established film House-it is even better." 
" Best film so far from the Ram Gopal Varma factory....","Satya was excellent.... Company was just as good but more polished, probably owing to the money earned from previous movies. Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining. The dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious. Nana Pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented. Direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax. As a depiction of reality it may be over-dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot-on. I've ordered my DVD and can't wait to see it again at home. As a lover of these type of gangster flicks, this is very gratifying  and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly "non-Yash Raj" Bollywood gangster flick lovers out there." 
" A really realistic, sensible movie by Ramgopal Verma","A really realistic, sensible movie by Ramgopal Verma . No stupidity like songs as in other Hindi movies. Class acting by Nana Patekar. Much similarities to real 'encounters'." 
" Engaging crime drama, Nana Patekar is awesome...","Crime drama genre is just like the chess game, if handled sensibly and very seriously. Its like you don't notice the motive or intention behind any move played by players ( in a movie, there are protagonist and antagonist) But as soon as the game comes towards climax, and protagonist checkmates the villain, you think of all those moves in sequence and how those moves trick the opponent to fall into his own trap. This game becomes more interesting and engaging when you get to know thinking behind every move played by the players. This is what director Shimit Amin achieved, with his brilliant direction, in this film by portraying each character and their role in main story which makes the movie one of the best crime drama movie.When you first see the poster and Nana Patekar in it with a tag line like "If I have to think about what's right and what's wrong just like you guys (addressing to the readers), then Who will do it (the killing)", u get the feeling that you will get to see something very interesting on the screen.The fearless encounter specialist, with very supportive commissioner of Mumbai Police Department to perform his duty without any restriction to clean the underworld and at the same time struggling to keep himself away from becoming a victim of jealousy of his own department member, faces difficulties while doing his job when a new commissioner is appointed. And execution of new orders from commissioner about an encounter leads to set a chain of incidents which create a gripping mind game.The depth in the character of Sadhu Agashe is wholeheartedly portrayed by legendary Nana Patekar with nuances and remarkable detailing. The dialogue delivery, body language and attitude of this actor is perfect for fearless Encounter Specialist. At the same time Nana Patekar portrays a loving family man, a protective father, frustrated cop. His facial expressions were outstanding while having a dialogue with his colleague about how cops are puppets of the politicians and system. All the other supporting actors play their role very well. Special mentions are Yashpal Sharma and Nakul Vaid.The character theme for Nana's character created by Salim-Sulaiman suits that character. The editing is tight and doesn't lose the hold and pace. Story and screenplay are awesome. Dialogues given to Nan's character are quirky and help build the character strongly. Dialoges between Nana and Don also add some humor in scenes. Cinematography is OK. Overall a good crime drama with magic touch of Nana Patekar is what Ab tak Chhapaan can be well described as. And yeah it is worth having along shelf life on DVDs." 
" Brilliant bollywood crime thriller. Come become a fan of Nana.","wow ! This movie really hits the spot. It is so well made and balanced resulting in some quality entertainment. It is a true thriller. The movie is hilarious with its dialogues without being comical. It maintains its pace and there are no songs.The characters in the movie are another highlight, all were introduced well and will make you like them.Nana Patekar's performance is brilliant, his bad-ass police style and slang will make u fall in love. The way he takes people's cases is fun to see. Revathy is also adorable as his wife and i am glad she plays a woman of her age.Sadhu(Nana) is an encounter specialist who pursuing members of two rival gangs. He has a happy family life ,he is respected at work and he is not conflicted by what he does. He has jealous subordinates and dons trying to buy him out but all under control. Good amount of screen time is spent in showing this setting in style and introducing characters. life is good ,until......When u are done watching u will find yourself chuckling in the memory of the dialogues , recollecting the plot with amusement and humming the theme music." 
" Extremely polished piece of film-making","Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard working, hard-edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison. His loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers, Imtiaz, becomes frustrated by Sadhu's high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case. Further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics.I was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from India. The camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. The acting, pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood, sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film-making."
