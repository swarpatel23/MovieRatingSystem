" Overused plot line, lame jokes...don't watch this movie","I swear if Indian cinema releases more dumb, cheesy, and overused plot crap I am gonna kill the next person who makes it. The comedy in this movie involves 2 guys constantly trying to get girls but then they always get beat up...its not funny anymore and it will never be.Tusshar yet again proves he can make a movie that will turn to be a straight out disaster...oh yea i forgot about the business man who apparently says work is his life, but who cares about him. Overall this movie sucks and if you wish to save your well earned money i warn you...DON'T WATCH THIS!!!i am warning you" 
" Kya Old Love Story Hai","I just seen this film on the cinema and it started off really amazing with the song It's Rocking, Kareena Kapoor was looking so beautiful & her dresses were fabulous. She has to be the most beautiful woman ever, even compared to any Hollywood actress. After the song the film was going quite well Tusshar Kapoor had taken care of the whole movie but when the new actor ( I don't know his name) who played Ranveer Oberoi a business man & he does not like to waste time, he spoiled everything I did not like him as an actor or his character. The story of the film is really old I knew the ending half way though the film but the cinematography was excellent. The songs are terrific composed by one of my favourite music composers Pritam. Every song is good and I like the remix version of the song Miss you everyday better than the original. Tusshar & Kareena were the best, Ayesha Takia was OK but the other guy who played Ranveer was terrible someone else should have taken his place. I just don't understand one thing that when Tusshar & Ayesha met the first time in Rocky's birthday party Ayesha's hair was flying all over when she was in front of Tusshar, how can there be wind indoors?, was there a fan in front of her? & if a fan was in front of her then why wasn't Tusshar's hair flying? Overall 5/10" 
" Not an uncommon love story","***Spoilers ahead*** Tusshar kapoor has not a good track record in bollywood. He did many forgettable role in films. He is probably best known for his role of 'lucky'- a deaf and dumb boy in 'Golmaal'. Ayesha takia is beautiful and to me she is best suited in a romantic film. Karan hukka has also an important role in this film. This is actually a love triangle. Tusshar has done some degrees in architecture but not practices because his father is rich. But Ayesha likes guys who are self dependent. So despite Tussshar loves Ayesha he could not tell her that. Tusshar gone to become established. But meanwhile Ayesha became engaged with Karan. Tusshar came back but seeing Ayesha engaged, he decided not to tell about his love because he wanted to see her happy. The story will end up in a typical bollywood style. This type of story we have actually seen so many times that we can predict the ending very easily. The acting was flat throughout the film. At least the director could have done better to lift the film slightly up. There were some comedy scenes but they were just annoying. The songs are also forgettable except that item song by Kareena. This type of movie should never be produced. Don't waste your time on this movie. Not recommended." 
" Correction","In fact I love this site & enjoy it a lot. The information on it highly authentic. But there was a mistake in this movie details. KAREENA KAPOOR played on a song. That is "Its rocking....". Even if you go at Kareena Kapoor's page. There you can find that she worked in "Om Shanti Om" but this movie is not there too. I could not find any location to submit the correction. So I used this option. Pl correct this. In fact I love this site & enjoy it a lot. The information on it highly authentic.
