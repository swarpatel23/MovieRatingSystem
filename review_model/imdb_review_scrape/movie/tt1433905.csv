" If you are looking for sheer comedy, then go for it. You will have a good time!!","This movie will not disappoint you, thats for sure. It is a fun filled hilarious film for the entire family. No double meaning or sex comedy. Enjoyable for kids and elders. It is not as entertaining like Hera Pheri, but certainly 100 times better than recent disasters like "Do knot disturb". The cast of the movie was pretty good. Sanjay Dutt, Fardeen Khan and Ajay Devgan did a good job. It starts to make you laugh almost from the beginning and then keeps you laughing till the end. The theater hall was roaring with laughter at times, and everyone had a smile on their face throughout. Other comedians apart from the trio were: Asrani: As funny as ever. He still manages to deliver the comedy with the same energy as before. I really admire him for that. Johnny Lever: Pretty good comedy Ashwini Kalsekar: Fails to get a grip on South Indian accent, so was disappointing. Sanjay Mishra, Atul Parchure & Vijay Patkar: These people don't need to do any comedy, their looks are funny enough.The jokes in the movie were fresh, unheard and hilarious. There were some breathtaking car racing stunts in the beginning for the action freaks. Most of the comedy credit goes to Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan duet in the movie. Bipasha Basu did her part well. All in all a very hilarious movie. Watch it with your family, you will certainly enjoy it. P.S: David Dhawan should certainly watch this movie and learn how to make comedy movies for today's audience." 
" A Good Decent Comedy Film","I am a great fan of Ajay Devgan Movies, and hence I was expecting a lot from this one, though the movie has competent like Blue. Lets start with story, story is very simple and outdated, Fardeen speaks a Lie to his brother (sanjay), and in the whole movie fardeen and his buddy (Ajay) trying to cover the truth. Direction is very good from Rohit Shetty, he had done Superb work after Golmaal and Sunday. Performance wise, no doubt Ajay devgan is the show stealer, Fardeen improves a lot, Bips and Mughda was hardly dere, But Sanju Baba does an awesome job, though I am not a fan of his movies, he is at his best in this movie, Another person who impress a lot in small role is Sanjay Mishra. I will rate 8/10, as these is a situational neat and clean comedy, without any double meaning words, and its a complete fun journey which you can enjoy with your whole FamilyALL THE BEST AJAY!!!" 
" Go for It!!!",""Laugh Riot" is the words for this movie. Watch it to release tension, to relax and to go crazy. watch it for the 1st time good act by Fardeen Khan.Put a bunch of performers in a situation and create some misunderstanding among them and you have a successful formula for a comedy film. For bonus you have Johny lever (with his newly discovered dumb act), Sanjay Mishra (his Praan mimicry act) and Ashwini Khalsekar (South Indian Aaya act. Watch this funny movie for its funny direction by Rohit Shetty!!!!All the Best....." 
" All the best is a good comedy","Directed by Rohit Shetty, the man behind the two recent Golmaal films – the first hilarious, the second not so – All The Best stars Fardeen Khan and Ajay Devgan as buddies Veer and Prem, who owe an awful lot of money to a local don, but have no means to raise it. Renting out Veer's sprawling Goa bungalow seems to be their only choice, but when Dharam, his burly step-brother played by Sanjay Dutt, shows up unannounced, Veer and Prem find themselves trapped in a mess of their own making.To increase his monthly pocket money, Veer has been lying to Dharam that he's married to his girlfriend Vidya, but Dharam has never met his sister-in-law. When Dharam mistakes Prem's wife Jhanvi (played by Bipasha Basu) for Vidya, no one bothers to correct him. So the real Vidya (played by Mughda Ghodse) must pretend to be Prem's girlfriend Jhanvi. Confused? Wait there's more. There's also the issue of the don's loan, and the new tenant wanting to move into the bungalow, but Veer and Prem are trying hard to hide those dirty little secrets from Dharam. An ensemble piece, apparently based on a popular play, All The Best wanders aimlessly for its first 15-odd minutes, only to come into its own with the arrival of Dutt's character Dharam, whose scenes with Devgan's Prem are easily the film's funniest. The set-up also includes a bunch of madcap characters including a mute gangster who communicates by rattling a spoon inside a glass, a Malyalee housemaid with a deep voice, a crackpot tenant who can't wait to move into his new house, and a tempo-driver who wants to unload the furniture in his vehicle so he can attend to his pregnant wife. The humour in this film isn't exactly smart, but it helps that the makers give you little time to dwell on that fact. The jokes come flying at you from all directions, and it's hard not to break into laughs when a big guy like Sanjay Dutt participates in the silliness. Shorter in length – its songs sacrificed, its action scenes trimmed – All The Best might have been a great Diwali treat. As it currently stands, it's a delicious one-time watch" 
" The first enjoyable comedy of 2009.","It's October 2009 and we still haven't got any worth watching comedy to remember. But the good news is that this dearth of quality fun capers has finally come to an end with "All The Best", a well made potent fun movie, packed with highly enjoyable hilarious moments for the needy viewers. Interestingly, though Rohit Shetty's comedy may be less exciting in its star presence as compared to the other biggies released on the same Friday, but in reality it seems to be the best of the lot presented before us in this festive mood.Moving around the same lines of "Golmaal" (2006) and Inspired by the play "Right Bed Wrong Husband", the story has the same old elements of mistaken identities, which in turn gives rise to some amusing funny moments to enjoy. The story mainly revolves around the character of Sanjay Dutt, who is a big business tycoon just visiting his younger brother, Fardeen Khan for a few hours. Mistaking Ajay Devgan's girl (Bipasha) as Fardeen's wife, the confusions start cropping up which even get worse when Sanjays's few hours stay gets converted into days due to the flight cancellation.Though, the movie starts with the same routine stuff of introducing the characters and their love connections along with the two unwanted songs right in the beginning. But after the first 15 minutes it straight away comes back to the job of making you laugh and also manages to complete its job quite successfully. The hilarious interaction between various characters entangled in the identity trap, generates enough laughter to give you a good time in the theater.With the entertaining comic timing between Sanjay Dutt & Ajay Devgan, the film picks up fast and gets good support from the side tracks of Johny Lever & Sanjay Mishra. In fact Johny Lever returns with his impeccable mannerisms posing as a Don who can't speak. He mimics Prem Nath's act of Karz in a very engaging manner and just excels in the climax when he gets his voice back accidentally. Sanjay Mishra as the rich man from the slums is also at his best, especially in his interaction scenes with Sanjay Dutt. Along with the superb performances of Ajay & Sanjay, Fardeen Khan as usual, just provides the required support to both. Bipasha also tries well to match up the comedy acts of others and looks after the glamour quotient of the movie too. But Mughda Godse is hardly there to prove herself.Pritam's not so great musical score sounds fine while watching the movie, but for a change, it doesn't compel you to buy the Soundtrack CD after the screening. Moreover a few songs could have been easily edited out to make it a crispier watch. Cinematography is perfect as required by a comedy flick, but the dialogue writing excels with some superb one liners and funny jokes.All the performers get brilliant support from their writers, especially in the scenes where Sanjay Dutt enters the house for the first time and in the climax, when all the characters are together on the screen. As a surprise, a highly emotional sequence also impresses you in this comedy when Bipasha is declared pregnant by the doctor. Collectively, all the three, Ajay Devgan, Sanjay Dutt and Johny Lever are in their full form after a long time, getting adequate support from the rest of the cast.In short, the multiple character entangle once again proves lucky for the director Rohit Shetty and he surely comes up with the first quality comedy of 2009. Go for it to have a good festive weekend with the family." 
" Comedy of errors!",""All the Best" is a total time-pass comedy which is executed fairly well. Its confusion galore everywhere. All the lead actor do their parts quite well especially the comic timing between them is superb which makes "All the Best" a worthwhile fare. The only shortcoming is that the lead actors especially Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan seem to be over-aged for the characters and perhaps younger generation would have been ideal fit (viz. Ritesh Deshmukh, Tushaar).Johnny Lever attempts to gain lost ground portraying Sir Judah but is not quite impressive. Ashwini Khalsekar overdoes the South-Indian bit. Songs are catchy and presented quite well actually. The car race sequence deserves special mention - well action sequences is Rohit Shetty's forte anyway. Finally, just because the Golmaal series fetched him recognition and since then Rohit Shetty seems to have glued to the comedy genre which IMO is under- utilisation of his potential. I would be seriously looking forward to Mr. Shetty work on serious genre and contribute to the progress of Indian Cinema." 
" Not great..but worth money with amazing comic timing","yes..I thought the critics were wrong when they publicized Rohit she-tty making Manmohan desai kinda movies.. But this time he proves he is on the right track..what makes the movie worth watching is the spectacular act put by sanjay and anil and you have a surprise here with fardeen and bipasha doing well as well.. the scrip is hilarious and you wil love seeing dev-gun playing a possessive lover boy.. some scenes are a lough riot and u will fall down laughing..over all a complete family entertainer with clean duologue's and no vulgar scenes.thumbs up for rohit she-tty for a fabulous job.keep going n keep giving us more diwali gifts every year" 
" Not great, but worth the money","Being a big fan of Rohit Shetty's previous work i.e. Golmaal, Golmaal Returns & Sunday, i was so excited about this release that I forced my friends to catch the morning show. The film like the Golmaal/Returns starts with a song which wasn't as good in comparison. The starts on a slow track and it is clear with the Maid's fake accent and few other scenes that they are trying to force the audience to laugh. Not much happening for sometime and when you have already concluded that this is a big mistake booom enters Sanjay Dutt. The fun actually starts from there as we the audience now feel like laughing. The biggest drawback of this movie I feel is that it is very clean, and now a days when everything has been tried in comedy, it is very difficult to make a comedy movie without double meaning dialogues. If you refer back to Golmaal/Returns & Sunday, you will find many adult jokes hidden. As all the best is family movie, it lacks that kind of humor. Overall i would say the movie is decent, horrible acting by Fardeen Khan, Bipasha is OK, Ajay Devegan has given much better performances and Sanjay Dutt is the best." 
" A Good Comedy","This was in deed a decent surprise – a movie that will have you laughing if that's what you want to watch. A young man, who is in love and wants to marry his girlfriend, is a singer by profession but has problems related to money and his best friend, who is married, tries to help him by giving him some ideas and implementing them.Starring Sanjay Dutt, Bipasha Basu, Ajay Devgan, Fardeen Khan, Ashwini Khalsekar, Asrani, Johnny Lever and Mukesh Tiwari. Directed by Rohit Shetty, Produced by Ajay Devgan and the music score is by Pritam Chakraborthy."Munnabhai" Sanjay Dutt and Mukesh Tiwari along with Johnny Lever, steal this show from all the others and all three of them are worth watching as they have some good scenes. Fardeen Khan was good but he could have done a bit better as he is capable of doing comedy. Action man, Ajay Devgan has improved in comedy, while Bipasha Basu and all the others are OK. Director, Rohit Shetty has made sure that there is laughter almost on a non stop basis as one comic scene follows another.What makes this film a bit interesting is that the actors speak a dialect of an African language – Swahili, which is from the East African region of the African continent and this is used rather nicely in a semiotic manner by Rohit Shetty, who has mixed this in with humour.If you are out to have a good laugh then this is a film that is worth watching." 
" One of the most hilarious movies I have seen in long time","This is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen in a long time or perhaps ever. It is a ride full of laughters and fun. Loved Ajay Devgan and Sanjay Dutt, All The Best completely belongs to the two. Loved Sanjay Dutt after a very long time. Never knew Ajay Devgan is such a stunning actor when it comes to comedies. He is awesome. Sanjay Mishra once again proves that he is becoming a must for comedy movies, a new Rajpal Yadav. Fardeen Khan did not impress much. And hats off to Rohit Shetty for coming up with this absolutely fun and hilarious movie. I was burst into laughters all the time. Great job. This movie will surely give Priyadarshan a run for his money. My rating : 9/10" 
" overall a nice movie","This is a nice flick to watch out for.Was disappointed with Rohit's Golmaal returns but was satisfied with this one.Comic timing is good....Bips as usual is looking really hot.Sanjay Dutt is looking obese.Mughda could have stayed out of this flick. Was unnecessarily there.Best comedian was Sanjay Mishra (One two three Fame) Ajay Devgan and Fardeen Khan were also good Overally, Much better movie than BLUE.One time watch so go and catch the flick." 
" Not the best, but a decent movie","'ALL THE BEST' is a decent movie with superb direction. Rohit Shetty and Ajay Devgan are again at their best. After GOLMAAL and GOLMAAL RETURNS, they are back again with lots of action, lots of fun, laughs and lots of romance all lead to 'ALL THE BEST'. The movie has some kiddish jokes also but overall it is a good and a time pass movie. Sanju bhai was again at his best. Ajay devgan was superb. Fardeen also acted nicely and fitted perfectly in the role of Veer. Bipaha Basu also was at her best. Mughda Godse could have done a little better. OVERALL it was a good and a funny movie. I would like to give the movie 6 stars out of 10. its indeed a watchable movie." 
" Finally,After Dhamaal we have a clean comedy","All the Best directed by Rohit Shetty is a neat and clean comedy.The movie is a good family entertainer.The story of the movie is simple.The screenplay is well-penned.In fact,this is one of the best comedies in the year 2009.The music is average.The dialogs are quite witty.Performances-Ajay Devgn is superb.Sanjay Dutt too excels.Fardeen Khan is overshadowed by Ajay and Sanjay.Bipasha Basu plays her part well.Mughda Godse is wasted.Johnny Lever is funny.Asrani is very good.On the whole,All The Best is a family sized entertainer!" 
" Laughs Guaranteed","All The Best is a laughter ride.The movie does get a little boring in the start and even gets a bit serious in the second hour.But still All the Best is high on laughter.The screenplay is excellent.Direction by Rohit Shetty is very good.The music is good.Dialogs are witty Performance wise-Ajay Devgn is the best.His comic timing is simply superb.Sanjay Dutt is another actor to watch out.He is great.Fardeen Khan is good.Bipasha Basu is good.Mugdha is wasted.Johnny Lever is excellent.Asrani is very good.Vijay Patkar as Johnny's sidekick is funny.Mukesh Tiwari and Ashwini Kalsekar are funny.Overall All The Best guarantees laughter."

" A movie made wasn't what i expected it to be","Ajay devgan production, well, thats good since, he can't act so much compared to his fellow colleagues who've gone high like Akshay. He wants to produce now. Good stay on this, and don't act.The movie is a time pass fun. The fun really doesn't begin until Dharm(played by Sanjay Dutt) the elder brother arrives. Upon his arrival there are series of lies which follow after one and another that point is where the comedy start but very much expected. The movie is given cool look. Sanjay Dutt steals the show basically. Being a Ajay Devgan fan, I expected much more. The leading ladies rock the party as with there glam. Songs are big and cool. The rest of the cast do there job very well. Johnny Lever come'on he can't be that comic with his glass of churaliya hai. If this movie is a sequael of golmaals then, don't watch it cause it's bad sequel. But fresh starters can enjoy some moments but not all. Fardeen gives a decent performance, Bipasha also is charming with her glam. Mogda hardly has anything to say expect for few lines in the movie. Sanjay Dutt is back with his comic charm and does still the lime off from Ajay and Fardeen. Watch it for him, he looks cool, with tattoos and comic scenes. He rocks, but the film is not even a masala mix, it's just whats us usually expected. Veer lies to his brother to get more money every month and upon surprise arrival of brother, there are series of act of lies which follow and that is where few comic moments are fun to watch but otherwise, a worse movie of Ajay. I would give a 4/10. Rohit Shetty the director does his job but needs to work harder to obtain a position in making comedies. Music is good for tittle song only. No story lies in today's movies. Leave your mind and thoughts behind and don't think while watching the movie. Watch it for Sanjay and if you don't have anything to watch. This movie is a time pass on DVD. Paisa Vassoool be nahin. I need my money back."
