" Amazing Thriller","The film's tag-line said it all which is "The most shocking thriller of the year". It was really shocking with twists & turns that were impossible to predict. You just don't know who is bad, who is good? and what is their motive? Do not mistake this film as another love triangle about two guys fighting for one girl because it's completely different. Urvashi Sharma (Sophie) was OK for her first film but Bobby Deol (Karan) and Akshaye Khanna (Vicky) were terrific as usual, it is great to see them again after Humraaz. Music is excellent composed by one of my favourite composers Pritam. The best songs are Ek Din (which stands out with its memorable Spanish guitar intro) and Aye Dil sung by Sunidhi Chauhan. Abbas-Mustan are known for creating good music in all of their films. They are one of my favourite directors; I loved their films ever since I seen Baazigar. Although they are inspired from Hollywood movies but their films are better than the original which are: Naqaab- Dot the I (2003)36 China Town- Chinatown (1974) Aitraaz- Disclosure (1994)Humraaz- A Perfect Murder (1998) Ajnabee- Consenting Adults (1992) Daraar- Sleeping with the Enemy (1991) Baazigar- A Kiss Before Dying (1991)" 
" Last 30 Minutes Saves It!","'Naqaab' which comes from the stable of the director duo Abbas-Mustan is a watchable movie! One wouldn't come out of the theater cursing it or ruing the wasted money!!! The first half of the movie is below par but I have given it a rating of 6 because the last 30 minutes really takes the graph of the movie to a new level. The first half seems a half-baked plot where all the three leading protagonists (Akshaye Khanna, Bobby Deol and the new Urvashi Sharma) are trying to create a love-triangle/drama of sorts. The character sketch in the first half not up to the mark and I can see a lot of viewers losing patience at the intermission mark. But boy, the movies does take a good turn in the second half. Though the movie is a rip off from a Hollywood flick (I would not name it though), it would come as a good enough thriller for Bollywood fans. Acting is not the strong point of the movie, Akshaye is strictly O.K. and Bobby Deol needs to get back to form really quickly. For her first movie, Urvashi is fine (and she is a quite a treat on the eyes). Another good thing is that song interruption is minimum in the movie (just 3 songs and one is kind of introduction). So all in all an average movie! Watch it just for sizzling Urvashi and the last 30 minutes." 
" The best Hindi Movie So far....in 2007.","The movie was great!!!. I saw a good Hindi movie after a long time. I have sure heard of Abbas-Mustan duo but got a chance to see their movie in Naqaab. I can see why they are making waves in Bollywood and Indian Cinema. This movie started like a triangle love story movie with a slow pace. I thought come on.... Hindi movies are always like this... but the directors kept us a question mark, nagging from where Aksay Khanna is introduced. After the interval... believe me it was racy, twists and turns, funny sometimes and finally the ending sealed the movie as one of the best movies of this year!.Bobby Deol... he comes as a multimillionaire and he is in love with Urvashi Sharma... they live together in the same bungalow in Dubai. She works in a restaurant and they planned to get married. In the engagement's's party by Urvashi she meets Akshay and subsequent meeting she falls in love with him. Bobby has played a meaty role with ease. He shows good acting in the first half as soft spoken lover and in the second half he plays/dons all kind of roles. I loved him in this movie. Urvashi Sharma.... first thing first... she has a great body, sexy eyes... my wife was jealous on her!!!!:). . A cute doll and she plays her role to perfection. Akshay Khanna.... well... he comes as a charming boy... does lot of tricks, deceives and flatters to win the love of Urvashi and us. He is good in his role, subtle in the second half. All other supporting cast have done great job to lift the movie. The movie has all elements of masala bollywood cinema and yet strikingly different from bollywood movies which has big stars like bachans or rai's or khans or johor. Go watch the movie!!!... if you have appetite for a different cinema. SriramPlus Points: Abbas-Mustan, Screenplay, Plot and all actors.Minus Points: hardly...no minuses" 
" A joke of a thriller","I always like Abbas-Mustan films like KHILADI, BAAZIGAR Off late their films are being bad like AITRAAZ, TAARZAN, 36 CHINA TOWN NAQAAB a remake of DOT THE 1Sadly this film is a complete joke of a filmFirst half is typical Hindi love triangle with everything looking fake Be it Bobby- Urvashi love story or Akshaye- Urvashi or even the too much cuts- edit and everything actuallythe kiss after The EK DIN song and all the hot scenes are badly handledFew comic scenes are fine here and there but then the film does a 360 turn and becomes even worse in the last few reelsThe entire turn of events make the illogical film a farce Imagine you are laughing at the film being typical Hindi stuff first and then when it tries to be bold it makes you cringeThe sets, wardrobe design all seem too cheapAbbas-Mustan gives one of their worst films ever Music is saving grace, EK DIN is good Cinematography is goodBobby looks bored in first half and manages some scenes towards the end well Akshaye Khanna with a bad wardrobe is wasted though he manages to leave a mark as always but now his role, style is getting predictableUrvashi reminds you of Udita Goswami and Rakhi Sawant which isn't a good thing, her voice is awfully dubbed tooVikas Kalantri and Vishal Malhotra tax your nerves" 
" It's Good... Surprisingly So... But!","--- Yaar! There May Be Spoilers Below - You'll Have To Decide ---It *is* a bit predictable and it's hardly "amazing" as SpringSummerWinter claims. It's a well done yarn and has a good measure of twists and turns but again, I think you'll see them as predictable ones. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy the movie: I most certainly did.With regard to acting... No one here is an A-List actor on a global level. Akshaye Khanna is the same character in every movie - it's like watching Dustin Hoffman - one acting model slightly dressed up differently for each film. While he does a credible job here - he's still the same tortured and tormented character that he always is and lifeless and stiff as such. Urvashi Sharma is gorgeous, and doesn't suck her first time out - but clearly she needs seasoning and I applaud her for taking the risk of doing the closest I've seen to a sex scene in a bollywood film - and in her first movie! YIKES!" 
" It's offbeat and its good","Another off beat movie for the Indian movie-goers, and it ain't that bad. Naqaab has a distinctly different style of story telling, and coupled with some exquisite shooting locations it is a visual treat to the eye. Urvashi Sharma is pretty good too. She's a delight to the eyes of every unmarried male. Although I must say the acting in this movie especially of Bobby Deol and Urvashi Sharma was pathetic. Akshaye Khanna is good, but this isn't his best of roles either.The story is like any Abbas-Mustan thriller. Ripped/adapted from classic Holly flicks. This time around its loosely based on The Truman Show, and no, SLV isn't the derived movie theme. It has a lot of twists and turns towards the end, which makes up for the pathetic first hour of the movie. At one point of time it was hard to imagine if the movie is a thriller or a comedy. The songs aren't that good, the camera work which should have been exquisite,considering video camera plays a chief role in the movie, isn't up to the mark as well.No point harping on the plot, it is basically a love triangle with a good twist in it. Its a fun watch at the end of the week, after facing the brunt of your boss' wrath." 
" not the best they've made, not the worst either","Abbas-Mustan, who have introduced bold concepts of wife-swapping, surrogate mother and sexual harassment to Indian cinema, true to their unique style of storytelling, try something different yet again. Naqaab certainly isn't your ordinary run-off-the-mill Bollywood love triangle. And true to the directors' trademark, the film is filled with twists and turns. Saying anymore would be giving the plot away.While the film is a far cry from Khiladi or Baazigar, it is far better than their recent "36 China town" and "Tarzan the wonder car" Casting is where the directors probably lost it: Akshaye Khanna, an old mascot in the A-M camp, seems not only out of shape to play a struggling actor, he seems 10 years too old for the part. Bobby Deol, another old favorite of A-M's still manages to look the part of the flamboyant rich man, but can't pull it off with finesse. Urvashi Sharma is a major let down in the acting department. her emotions seem concocted and superficial. While she looks decent enough in places, there are parts where she is either made to look bad, or achieves it naturally. The supporting cast is feeble. Vikas Kalantri and Vishal seem to be playing buffoons stuck with a serous job. who knows why Raj Zutshi is even there in the film? While the locations and camera work merge seamlessly into the film and the plot is complex and well conceived, the film loses out in its execution: at times focusing on the obvious and at times playing a tangent to the storyline. while it scores points for originality and keeping the audience curious, it loses points for performances, or lack thereof and one twist too many.The first half sets the plot in motion with haphazard character introductions and development, and the second half has a twist every few minutes, intentionally put to keep the audience in their seats. character motivations seem strong enough but somehow the film lacks flow.the good: plot has interesting concept, interesting twists the bad: the acting, the execution of the plot the ugly: the supporting cast final verdict: Could have been better, but worth one watch" 
" Self styled thriller that failed to thrill the audience","Alright, the movie was pathetic and I would suggest a "Skip It" option and wait for their CD (yes, not even worth a DVD) version or better yet wait for the TV version.Of course, it is the Bollywood version of another not-so-good Hollywood flick  dot the i; no surprise there! "dot the i" took place in London whereas Naqaab took place in Dubai. Your memories may also give you flashbacks of The Truman Show and The Graduate.The story involves a Love Triangle amongst multi-millionaire Karan Khanna aka Rohit Shroff (Bobby Deol), Vicky Malhotra (Akshaye Khanna) and Sophia (Urvashi Sharma). Sophia is a jolly girl who have changed more jobs than she changed her clothes  worked for a construction firm, beauty parlor and finally we saw her as a Burger King girl during the course of the Movie Storyline. She is a casual but self-respecting girl, pays her rent to Karan while she continues a live-in relationship with him in his big Mansion.Anyway, it is funny that such big Mansion of Karan is home to just three person  Sophia, Mrs. Gomes and Karan with no security for such a multi-millionaire Home. Anybody can come in anytime from the main gate either at day (The private detective/photographer coming in to meet Karan) or night (remember Sophia coming home date that day from a date with Vicky).Finally, when Sophia got engaged to Karan after 6 months of living together; she met Vicky Malhotra on her Engagement Party at a Posh Hotel in Dubai. Much to the delight of everybody, she was supposed to dance her last pre-marriage dance with a man of her choice. She chose Vicky and they fell in some sorta Love. I never knew love is always that simple in Bollywood. What did she saw in Vicky that she missed in Karan? Those crudely cut Salsa-type dance done in multi-multiple takes? This is one self-claimed Thriller that will not thrill you at all. The first half of movie moved at snail's pace and stayed with building the characters. The encounters of Sophia and Vicky was exceptionally slow and unnecessarily long. The movie tends to move to the comic side at the end or where the Movie makers assuming that the audience will need some comic relief from the thriller that failed to thrilled? And what with the 2 camcorder flinging self-styled producers  Vikas Kalantri and Vishal Malhotra? Why do Bollywood always take mediocre and sub-standard actors for the non-lead roles in movies. They could have been replaced by some better actors and could have done a little justice to the movie. They are supposed to be supporting characters to the actual plot of the movie.I won't really discuss the funny plot and be a spoiler for you who wish to see the movie. But gain, that's a stupid movie according to me. Btw, for those looking out for Urvashi Sharma, well then she has the body and there was enough of her flesh in the movie to quench your thirst. However, she is neither beautiful nor pretty and her acting ain't that good at all." 
" Funny if anything, but not worth spending money on","Having seen this with no idea what it was about, I wasn't sure if it was going to be a complete song-and-dance-fest..or not. But, I stuck through it all. A couple of minutes of no subtitles in some sections, subtitles of spoken English that didn't match the spoken English and spelling mistakes in the subtitles added to the hilarity. It doesn't try to be a comedy, but is completely unbelievable throughout and features a ridiculous storyline that becomes more hilarious towards the end.If you didn't pay to see the film (I used my unlimited pass, so I can see as many films as I like in a month for one price), then great, it's a passable form of entertainment as long as you don't expect, well, anything at all. Otherwise, unlucky." 
" Best thriller film of 2007","I loved the film very much it was interesting Good story-line good direction good acting good casting good songs I liked akshaye khanna performance he was good in his character Urvashi did wonderful in her debut Bobby was impressive in his role Other were decent in their characters Songs are my favorite I keep listening to them My rating is 8/10" 
" At the end of this movie, I didn't know who to hate","Karan Oberoi, every girl dreams of a guy like him, handsome, very understanding and rich. Mr. Rohit, mysterious guy who has something to do with Sophia which brings us to the beautiful Ms. Sophia D' Costa who is the heroine/villain of this story and of course Mr. Vicky Malhotra our hero/villain who is an actor who wants to fulfill his dead father's dreams. I liked this movie because it is original, not another boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, enter new boy, girl falls in love with new boy, old boy exits stage left gracefully . . . Instead the plot gradually thickens with every new scene and the entrance of each new revelation makes the viewer actually use their minds instead of wanting to just get the movie over with. We are also left with so many choices of people to crucify for Rohit Shroff's murder, The abusive but unlikely Rakesh, Ronnie and Siddarth who wanted credit for the successful movie and Sophia and Vicky, lovers torn apart by Rohit's love of money, all with a reason for revenge." 
" Ripped off from a UK film","This movie's a poor remake of a 2003 movie called "Dot The i" written and directed by Matthew Parkhill and starred Gael Garcia Bernal, Natalia Verbeke and James D'Arcy. I loved that movie and was saddened to see this awful remake. This not an adaptation or an interesting take on the original. It is totally ripped off, scene for scene. The location has been changed to Dubai- that's it. This travesty is made worse by forgettable songs and third rate acting by the whole cast. I don't think anyone ever acknowledged the original movie. I wonder how anyone can get away with this in this day and age when everyone is sensitive about intellectual property rights." 
" The twists and turns in Naqaab make no sense at all.","From prolific filmmaker duo Abbas-Mustan Naqaab.In this film that's set in Dubai, newcomer Urvashi Sharma and Bobby Deol play a young couple engaged to be married. It's another thing he's a multi-millionaire with a home the size of a palace, and she works at Burger King and pays him rent to live under his roof. Just days before her marriage to Bobby, she meets and strikes up a friendship with an aspiring actor played by Akshaye Khanna. Sparks fly between the two, but on Urvashi's insistence their friendship is kept strictly platonic. On D-Day, however, just moments before she exchanges marriage vows with Bobby, Urvashi has a change of heart. Up until this stage, the film made perfect sense to me, but it's from this point onwards that Naqaab turns truly bizarre. It would be unfair to reveal any more of the plot because that would give away the surprise element of the film. But believe me, you'd never have guessed where this film was going anyway, because it's so ridiculous and unimaginable. Now you're probably wondering why I'm complaining if the film is unpredictable, because unpredictable is a good thing, right? Well, there a difference between unpredictable and ridiculous, and the thing about the twists and turns in Naqaab is that they're absolutely ridiculous. For years Abbas-Mustan have ripped off popular films from Hollywood and delivered successful Hindi remakes: Khiladi, Baazigar, Daraar, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, Ajnabee, Humraaz and Aitraaz.But with Naqaab they've hit their weakest note because it's a thriller without any thrills if you ask me. There's none of that nail-biting tension, no suspense and an anti-climax to top it all. I could pick a hundred holes in the screenplay but I don't even want to bother, because that would still mean putting in more effort than the writers and the directors have. You know one's willing to suspend disbelief if your script can convince me to make that leap of faith. And Abbas-Mustan know that better than anyone else. We've happily gone along with their stories of mistaken identities, reincarnations, double roles, death-avenging relatives, and murderous spouses.But with Naqaab they come up with something so bizarre that's it's really difficult to digest. In all honesty, I was so stunned by the banality of the plot that I was convinced this couldn't be a rip-off. It had to be some amateur writer's amateurish effort which Abbas-Mustan decided to direct. But to my surprise I discovered that Naqaab is not only a bad script, it's also not an original script. It is copied from a film called Dot the I starring Gael Garcia Bernal. The directors of Naqaab have plundered, lock stock and barrel from that obscure American film. It's not just the plot and the premise of that film that's been borrowed, even dialogues from that film have been directly translated into Hindi and shamelessly used. When a film's not working for you, you can usually find a million things to not like in it. As far as Naqaab is concerned, I have to ask if the costume designer of the film was smoking pot while at work. How else do you explain the horrifying clothes that she's draped most of the actors in—red lace gloves for the leading lady, pink satin shirt with a matching pink waistcoat for Bobby, and double-layered clothes for Akshaye. Hell, why? Also what's with all those ugly sets? From the outside Bobby's home looks like the Queen of England's holiday home, but the interiors are the kind of tasteless sets they used to construct at Hyderabad's Banjara Hills for those B-grade family dramas in the eighties. There's little one can say about the three actors in this film, they perform adequately but fail to make much of an impression and it's hardly their fault given the kind of material they're working with. Abbas-Mustan's Naqaab is far-fetched and illogical and there's hardly anything to like about it." 
" A Garbage disguised in Thriller","Right before watching Naqaab I understood that if I have ever to catch this Abbas-Mustan thriller that would be only for newly introduced Urvashi Sharma. Beside this I find no other reasons to watch. Every time I see Urvashi I remember of Diana Rigg, the Bond girl of 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service opposite George Lazenby. She is new but surprisingly she did help to flash the camera as a new battery. Although the movie was made colourfully it hardly puts any positive colour to our heart, due to such an over-twisting plot.This is the third nonsense directorial presentation from director duo Abbas-Mustan after Daraar and Badshah. After watching a single time I got fed up with the movie and hope not to repeat it watching again. So far they have used Bobby Deol with better prospects in their previous thrillers - Soldier, Ajnabee and Humraaz, but here they all put him under the mud. Although his role has a bit tragedy here but it fails to load back in memory after the movie reaches its end. But the romantic humours between Akshaya and Urvashi are really hilarious and worth watching. Quiet something they can form a good pair if mechanized correctly.I had to say once again if there is any reason to watch Naqaab, that is Urvashi Sharma. She performed her first role with full confident, and I noticed nothing weaknesses in her acting as well as screen-presence. I beg to Abbas-Mustan to cast her in future again in their next upcoming projects with good story, casting and production." 
" Goof","After Karan's death when Vicky is describing his role to Sophiya, there's a scene when he's talking along with Rohit and other guys in a Dubai hotel about the dance situation when Sophiya would be made to dance with the most handsome guy (thats Vicky-Akshay Khanna). At that time Vicky mentions "the night when Sophiya kept her engagement party at the hotel, that morning Karan (instead of mentioning Rohit, Akshay Khanna mentions Karan) made him meet the hotel manager and singer" however he doesn't know who Karan is by that time. He comes to know about Karan after 5 min when Rohit walks out to his room and Sophiya is surprised. Then is the time when he comes to know about Rohit and Karan. This is one.Second goof is when Karan shots himself. Have a look at the glass when he shots himself and when he tells Sophiya about his shooting. Both sequence are different." 
" Not the most shocking thriller of the year.","As a huge fan of Bobby Deol, I had to see this movie. It was supposed to be the most shocking triller of the year, yeah right! I have seen better thrillers of Bobby Deol, like Ajnabee and Humraaz (last movie also with Akshaye Khanna).The movie began as a Hollywood movie, nut I can't recall the name of that movie. So, it was a copied movie again of Hollywood! Not nice, I don't like that. I prefer originality more.So here comes a big spoiler! Don't read this if you don't have seen the movie! Karan (Bobby Deol) is engaged to Sophia (Urvashi Sharma). Not a nice actress though. To simple. Karan is a film maker and plans to hire an actor Vicky (Akshaye Khanna) to flirt with his fiancée. All to make his film (big brother). I liked that part of the movie. But when Sophia finds out her fiancée was only with her to make his movie, she gets angry! She has fallen in love with Vicky, and they plan to kill Karan.Come on! What were you guys thinking making this movie? It's like some annoying kid comes at your door and rings the bell. After that he runs away. It's very stupid. But when you know this kid has done that to you, you are planning to kill that kid. It does not make any sense. You don't kill someone because he fooled you.I didn't like this movie at all. I didn't like Arvashi as an actress. In the beginning of the movie she dances in front of the camera. Why? What was the purpose of her dancing? What was the purpose of the film makers to copy a part of a Hollywood movie? Come on, be original and don't come up with such a stupid story."
