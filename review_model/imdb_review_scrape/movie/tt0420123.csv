" The only thing that is good in the Movie is Kashmira Shah","This movie has nothing at all to offer, its bad executed, and produced, and the acting from almost all the No name actors and the known actors are the worst you can see.But there is still a highlight in the movie , and that is Kasmira Shah, she does a very good job. The movie has one very strong point and that is, never to sell your own Body not matter what.The story is about a poor girl who collect garbage and makes money out of it, she gets tired of that life and want to get out of this community. Wherever she goes she get sexual harassed but she still doesn't go down and keeps on fighting.The movie will be forgotten or not seen in many cases, and it will at the most terms be remembered when Kasmira Shah is changing her clothes or where you see her singing a song in the Bathroom."
