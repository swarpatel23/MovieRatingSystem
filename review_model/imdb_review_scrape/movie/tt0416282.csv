" Not too bad.....Not too bad at all!","Overall this was a pretty good movie!(Definitely worth a watch) Usually i never write comments for movies, but felt that the comments left by the others, were a bit to harsh on the movie.Often before watching a movie i check out its rating on IMDb, to see whether its worth watching or not and i so with this movie too. After seeing the rating and reviews, i wasn't really looking forward to watching the movie but i had the movie on one of those 3 in 1 DVD's hence watched it anyway. Well after watching it i was pretty surprised to find it was decent movie, hence this review and a recommendation to others to give the movie a chance. Don't get me wrong by any means, this is not a polished piece of cinema or even of the horror genre but its not as bad as others have made out either. Also i found that watching the movie on my PC alone in my room did the trick in terms of making the movie a little more scary (although that day i was jumping at shadows hence I'm not sure exactly how much credit to give to the movie for that:))Summation:Decent movie(with flaws as others have mentioned), but worth a watch and great acting from the child actor and Sushmita Sen always puts in a very solid performance. Also it nice to see Bollywood become more diverse, rather then sticking to a the love theme constantly, hence movie like this and directors such as RGV and Mani Ratnam are appreciated.7/10" 
" Nicely done!","At this point I've seen more than a few Hindi horror movies and for the most part I usually find them amusing but certainly not scary. This one... well, "scary" might be taking it too far, but creepy it certainly was. I'm not sure that any Indian horror film has raised my neck hair as often as this one did. Predictable? Sure... but aren't they all? There are very few "original" story ideas left in the horror genre. But even with the best of story ideas, it's the execution that separates the good from the mediocre from the truly bad (see "Kaun?", 1999). And Vaastu Shastra is pretty much spot-on in the execution department. Staging and lighting worked well, even the makeup was better than the norm (especially for the creepy dead-things). And while some have pointed to other films as "inspirations" for "Vaastu Shastra", it's not the obvious Hollywood or Korean or Japanese (or Hong Kong, or...) ripoff that you might expect. Yes, there are elements of several previous films, but really... can't you say that about just about every horror movie released since "Night of the Living Dead"? Someday perhaps a writer somewhere in the world will come up with a story we've never seen before. But with the sheer number of films that have rolled out since the invention of the motion picture camera, it's nearly impossible to make a film in any genre -- especially the horror genre -- that doesn't include elements of those that have gone before. "Vaastu Shastra" is no exception, but the "borrowed" elements are more a salute to the films that came before it than they are blatant plagiarism. This is a well written, well-directed, well produced movie and one well worth watching." 
" Not bad at all","I went into this film completely expecting it to be terrible. I have to admit, I thought it to be rather good. A few of the sound effects were overused (slamming door, laughing child) but I was clutching my puppy at the conclusion. To me, the tone was very akin to The Ring. Just, unsettling, in that certain way. The acting was good and even the little boy was very talented in his role. I didn't find it particularly predictable and as a Bollywood fan I am pleased to see the genre of Indian film expanding past the romantic comedy/musical genre. Surprisingly, this film was sans musical numbers, which, I think made it all the more ominous. I recommend this for foreign film fans and horror aficionados." 
" A good modern Bolly Horror","This movie would be the second horror/mystery movie of Modern Bollywood.Raaz was the first try, and it was "Romantic-Comic-Horror" never before seen in history of film.I would rate this movie 9/10. Good acting by all, speacialy the KID who just steals the whole movie.RGV's style of movie making is great too. He has a good and an artistic vision, but he needs to work little more when it comes to Horror.Overall it includes some good chills, but little weak plot and unclear background.Watch "Bhoot", then this and wait for "Kuch to Hai." Lets see where Bollywood goes with Horror" 
" Performances and Inconsistencies (may be spoiler, not sure, pls read inconsistencies after watching it)","The movie starts a bit slow, with a young couple moving in a new house of their choice, though it seemed a godforsaken place I don't know why they thought it suitable!! Anyway that is their and the directors judgment I would guess. Sushmita and Chakravarty (sans the beard) both try their level best to engrave the name of the movie on the viewers by uttering the name "Vaastu" twice, once when they just came to see it, and once again when Sushmita had to mention how good her house was to one of her colleagues!! I wonder, if it would have mattered if they would have named the movie "bhoot bangla"(haunted house)or Ham sandwich!! The effect would have been the same. At least one pandit or someone knowing a bit about vaastu should have made an appearance to make it look real may be :-) as in all Hindi movies...well viewers had to assume that it had to be vaastu causing these poor "bhoot" creatures dwelling in these Phantom (from comic series) like tree houses. They even had ladders to lure people to the top !! Hey, at least, my pre-movie thought was that, the house must be having wrong vaastu but the heroine mercilessly crushed them under her heels in the first scene when she says the house has perfect Vaastu. there goes one viable option for the poor souls.Inconsistencies: Well there are innumerable, and may be a avid watcher may find a lot more than what I found with a mind swaying from boredom to utter helplessness.i) The last part shows that the ghosts or souls (sounds more politically correct) are all 'killed', if I may use that word, when the car bursts into flames under their tree house!! But hey, u also have the small kid of the couple converted to a ghost by then, and thus he should also have turned to ashes like his illustrious daddy and mausi?? Nice camouflage I would guess may be, please directorsaab, provide "some" explanation! Most importantly after such medical examination that both the mother and the son must have been subjected to the doctors where unable to find out whether the son was alive or was a ghost!! hahahahaha, come on...thats crap!!ii) The mad person who is shown to know more about the house than anyone else, well he must be Cristobol Colon (Christopher Columbus for uninitiated) since not only did he pass the guards in the hospital when he himself looked like a ruffian, but also managed to find busy Sushmita twice in her hospital without ever knowing where she may be working!! iii)(May be interesting fact but not inconsistency) The movie shows that the children ghosts are indeed friendly in the first few days and only that they find out about Radhika (Rads in the movie) who is romancing her classmate in secret, that they turn hostile!! Hey the ghosts have got to do something with secrecy, they even killed the Bai for stealing :-Div) Why does the Bai think that the poor 4 yr. old kid could throw the tennis ball when she had been looking at the kid all the time before the ball hit her, and she knew perfectly well that the ball was not in his hand, before the incidence and that the ball came from beneath the cot. No doubt about that. Then why does she threaten him for throwing the ball at her ?? And also indeed he threw it, how can he do it with so much power to make such a mark on her face?? I guess all of us who has played with them, would know how much a mark they can make on ur face if u are hit!!v) Sushmita directly calls the police officer without first calling the police station, well well, and if he had a cellphone, then she would need to remember the number by heart since she calls from a landline! Else who stores police officer's cell phone number in a landline phone hotkey ?? :-D hilarious for me, may be inconsequential but come on, Bollywood has to grow up!! Well, though I found all these but u may surely find a few more, but from somewhere I came to know this is the directors first movie, well I ask him, please try to explain things a bit more may be the next time he does indeed find another producer. First time still okay, but this was a comedy with all the zombies coming in a group at the end towards our frightened and helpless Sushmita trying to run away with a ghost child!!" 
" Good oneüëç","This Movie is a very good attempt by the director and it definitely stays with you after watching this movie for a quiet long time. Not a typical but a unique one to experience for horror lovers of Bollywood." 
" One of the best horror movies in India!!","RGV continues with his ability to surprise the audience in this movie - sometimes a positive and sometimes a negative surprise. I found this movie positively surprising. A masterpiece in the genre of horror movies in India the movie carries on the legacy created by Bhoot and grips you slowly with fear. The eeriness quotient rises as the movie progresses and its not about the ghosts with funny caricature like faces but about something which you can feel. I would rate this in the league of Raat by Revathi. RGV has the ability to create an eerie atmosphere without usage of much of dialogues between the characters. The tempo of the movie is a bit slow initially but really speeds up in the end. The climax is apt for the theme." 
" Not bad for a horror flick from Bollywood","One thing is clear: horror is not exactly the strong side of Bollywood. And what is more: it is not exactly the strongest side of Ram Gopal Varma either. Although I admire him both for his work and his courage (let's face it, he is at least one of the very few who try), it cannot be denied that his horror flicks are still far from what a decent horror movie should look like. That said, Vaastu Shastra is definitely one of the better ones. In my opinion, it's neither better nor worse than films like Bhoot and Phoonk.The storyline is weak. There's a lot I can buy in a haunted house story - scary-looking ghosts loitering around among its new inhabitants, a little boy obviously able to seem them while others can't, you name it. But in this case, the story utterly lacks consistency. For a long time, it seems unclear what these ghosts actually want, even after they have murdered Rohan's evil nanny. They haven't done any harm to the family, so it just might be that they are protecting the boy. But then, they suddenly murder his young auntie and her lover. We've seen it coming, alright, but still we don't know why, or why now and not earlier. And we will never find out. But that's not the worst. At first, the ghosts are present, but pretty much invisible. Later, they suddenly become visible to anybody. As it turns out, they aren't ghosts at all, but merely zombies, and not just one little family of them, but a whole army of zombies who all live in a dead tree. One the tree is burned down, the whole bunch of zombies disappears - except for a few of them. Again, nobody knows how, or why. From that point of view, Vaastu Shastra is a mediocre hodgepodge of clich√©s and effects that are obviously considered more important than a remotely consistent storyline.Effects are heavily overdone. I admit, it is a matter of taste. Vaastu Shastra is a horror flick from the very first till the very last minute. Both the camera work, the music and the sound effects are done in such way that you can never relax... there is always a sense of an invisible spectator, of some unknown evil approaching, of something going to happen within second from now. It is as if the movie constantly tries to convince you to be scared all the time. Agreed, it is an approach, but it kills the surprise. If you ask me, it works much better when the movie makes you feel comfortable first, and only then the horror comes out suddenly, completely unexpected. Then again, it is a matter of taste. Still, I think numerous sound effects - slamming doors, roaring predators, ghastly giggling - are gravely overused.That said, Vaastu Shastra also has something positive to offer. The acting work by Ahaas Channa (the little boy) and Sushmita Sen (Mr. Rao) is excellent. As a matter of fact, the first half of the movie is fairly well done. I'd even say: a pretty good watch. It's only after the worst inconsistencies start crawling in - say, when it turns from an average haunted house movie into a bad zombie movie - when the level really goes down. Notwithstanding that, I've enjoyed watching it, even though it won't stand any comparison to horror from other parts of the world." 
" "It's very inauspicious, don't you know."","Never seen a Bolly-Horror before.In fact I think this might be the first Indian film I've seen period. Ever open-minded, I approach with zero expectations and give it full chance to tell me its story.In tg opening 30 minutes I felt it does a decent enough job of setting the scene, raising questions and planting supernatural hints. It's clear something is up, but you have to wait to find out exactly what. The tennis ball, disembodied childish laughter and sinister growling all add to the growing sense of unease. It's not exactly groundbreaking, more competent. 
It's clear that the sinister old banyan tree is in some way key, as it's here that the majority of inexplicable phenomena is centred.Personally I like a slow build to the tension, rather than immediate monsterbloodeath. It makes you feel you've worked to 'enjoy' the scares, having traveled the same emotional journey as the characters.I feel it works here as it's well over 30 minutes into the runtime before we get an actual spooky assault on one of the principals. That kind of restraint that could be a big gamble but I don't think it drags too much in the setup.Love how the subtitles clearly aren't translated by someone who is fluent in both languages;"Moreover, he's so much of imaginative." Worried mum Jill (who is definitely an IMILF - and I don't mean Apple have got into mature escorts...)Or later when the hermit-type jabbering loonatic is trying to warn mum and sister - by hammering on the car window and chasing them.What kind of reaction did he expect from them to this behaviour?! It doesn't help that he goes on to yell,"It's very inauspicious, you don't know."
Either even Indian crazies speak remarkably formally or the translator was having a bit of a laugh. By the hour mark, the jump-scare sudden noises/demonic growling begins to wear a little thin. 
When we first actually meet Manish, I think it would have been more effective if it was accompanied by silence. 
If memory serves me correctly, I'm sure that the ominous, pale and corpselike little boy Toshio who haunts some of the unfortunate victims in Ju-On: The Grudge, isn't accompanied each time with jarring loud music/sound effects.When we reach the final third of the film, the continuing jump-scare sudden noise/tiger growling is wearing pretty thin. Especially as the angry 'bad man' is still not really doing a great deal. Poor little Rohan, despite all the clearly creepy stuff going on, none of the adults want to believe him so he is admonished for lying. We'll see who'll have the last laugh...
It's a crying shame that the very attractive aunty Radhika gets got by the Bad Man, especially without letting us get a good look at her ;-)Despite hints and speculation, we still have no clear idea who these restless spirits are and why they have such a downer on the new family in the house. Better left as a tantalising and chilling mystery? Hmmm, but that tree is definitely a hub of evil." 
" Vaastu shastra","Producers of Vaastu-Shastra warns: it you watch this film we shall not be responsible means that if you regret after watching it, blame it yourself as we already warned you. Final word, watch it at your own risk.Nothing much in the name of story-a couple, writer-husband (why he is shown a writer? don't know) and doctor-wife (why is she a doctor-don't know ?) with their little son and a sister-in-law comes to stay at a deserted house in the middle of a jungle. Perfect setting for chills and thrills. Why they need to come down to a place 20 km away from city, again don't know ? Now that house is haunted. Ghosts make frequent visits and some befriends the little boy, why only boy, don't know ? First the boy's evil-intentioned governess gets killed by ghosts. Later, Sister-in-law's boyfriend gets killed by ghosts and so is sister, when they are secretly mating in the house. In the end, an entire force of all dead people (Ghosts) appears to kill all those who are alive. Now if sole intention of the Ghosts is to kill the inhabitants of that house then why they waited till 2 hours of movie's running time, and get to work only in the climax. That's not all. There is even an insane man (Rajpal Yadav, now when is the last he played a sane character ?) who continuously warns about haunted house but is ignored by all. Why this character is needed, don't' know ? There is a ghostly tennis ball who does things on its own but later where it vanishes nobody knows ? For horror factor, there are some scary faces with loads of heavy makeup and lighting, but that's about it. The biggest suspense in the film is why it is named Vaastu-shastra, which you will not able to crack even when the film is over. Immensely talented debutant director Saurabh Usha Narang (see his episodes of Haqeeqat on Sahara One TV) and even the cameraman Sachin K Krishn not able to erect a better narrative on this deadly (or dead) plot. Merely, a noisy sound track (Ajay Kumar-Kunal Mehta) and a haunting score (Amar Mohile) can't hold the audience for about 2.10 hrs. The content level is low in the film. Performances just passes muster. There are no songs in the film and they are not needed also.At one place you find some relevance, when you see the name of production company The Factory. Indeed it is an assembly line product on the lines of previous Raat, Bhoot, Darna Mana Hai etc.Read another warning from producers- if Bhoot scared you, this one kill you ? Well Bhoot definitely scare never mind if the narrative is thin but is properly packed with all gimmicks of a horror flick but this one sorry to say kills only your expectations but yes it might kill your factory Mr. Producer if you continuously churn out such flicks. Now this is a warning from a concerned viewer, are you listening ?" 
" It borrows from a lot of past horror flicks but manages to stand out.","A family moves into a home in the middle of nowhere, where an old and dead-looking tree in front of the new property seems to swallow people whole and make them vanish forever. At first I was thinking 'The Shining' being that the man of the house is also a writer and that the house is also haunted but it's not a complete knock off the Hollywood classic. Slowly but surely, everyone within the home either dies or becomes possessed by the evil spirits that reside in the tree in front of the house. The problem with the story is that nobody usually lives to tell the story of what happened. But a mother (Sushmita Sen) desperate attempt to saves her son breaks that cycle or does it? You'll have to watch and see in this quite frightening tale by Bollywood's Stephen King, Ram Gopal Varma." 
" Piece of trash!","Ram Gopal Varma creates more mysterious garbage! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is so bizarre, repulsive, and stupid. Varma was right--this movie is very scary--so scary that it scared the audience out of the theaters! By the end of the movie, I was laughing my head off. That's not a good sign when you're watching a horror/thriller. The climax is so disgusting and utter nonsense! Do yourself a big favor and avoid this one! I must say, though, that the child artist was awesome! He really looked as if he just saw a ghost. He definitely deserves some awards for his performance. Sushmita also did a good job." 
" If bhoot scared you, this might bore you! (or whatever!)","No Spoilers (there are no actual spoilers anyways)I just saw this movie at a preview in New Delhi(PVR) i.e. on Wednesday (two days before the release) and i was really looking forward to this one. But as in the case of most Hindi movies ,I was disappointed yet again. The movie starts off real slow with unwanted sound effects (not even effects but those silly bangs and booms to give the audience a jolt)(a cheesy one includes sounds of a tiger roar now and then) which sounded inappropriate at times. Well, nothing i mean NOTHING happens till one and a half hour of the movie(what happens is the same old sightings of those zombies roaming in the house) and what all happens after that is silly (totally silly).But the thing that bothered me most is that there are numerous plot holes in the story. In other words, this movie is made of three things: Plot holes, Plot holes and Plot holes. The screenplay (or the story) is pathetic. Many things remain unexplained and its like they are showing whatever they want to without even thinking about it once.First i thought 'God, they have copied 'The Shining' because there was this boy who goes about the house in his small cycle and his dad is a writer and then when he starts seeing the ghosts i thought 'Okay its Sixth Sense now' but it was not even so. The Ending sequences are really stupid and seems like the director and the screenwriter are complete idiots to have thought of making such trash. The visual effects were as if they are of a B movie and were nowhere near visual effects (a kid could have done them up).SPOILERS HEREIN - Those who want to know what it is aboutThe kid sees a zombie family and roams around the house speaking to them and playing with them. The zombie children live on a Banyan Tree (don't know if Bargat ka pedh is Banyan) and there's a small shed in the backyard of the house also. Some stupid scenes include a ball hanging in the air going here and there.So his parents(The incredibly talented Sushmita Sen and that guy from Satya) hire a 'Bai' who steals their stuff and is hit by one of the Ghosts (zombies)(the scene is hilarious). She tells the boy not to tell his parents about her and even threatens to kill him. When he tells his parents they become worried coz of the weird things their child is talking about but then the maid gets killed and all the stuff is found which she stole so Sush realizes her kid was indeed seeing the ghosts all the while.Also there is that funny short guy from Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon who features in all of Ramu's productions (He was also in Hungama). He seems to know the story behind the family in the house and jumps in front of Sush's car whenever she goes to the hospital (she is playing a doctor)Throughout the movie the kid keeps seeing the zombie family (which is not at all scary) and one night he and his parents go out for a movie, Sush's sis Radhika (played by Piya) is alone in the house and her boyfriend Murali comes to the house (Purab that channel [V] VJ) and starts playing with her in bed and then suddenly he disappears (The crappy part starts now).MAJOR SPOILERSRadhika starts searching him and then gets killed by the zombies. When Sush and people return they find Murali killed in bed and Radhika hanging by the tree. Even the husband gets killed and the boy is also smacked by the zombie family (who are now joined by Radhika and Murali zombies). Susmita comes to know about the tree through that mad guy (Small funny guy) and when she returns she sees her little boy lying on the floor and now her husband is also a zombie. She picks him up and runs for her life. Starts her car and goes round and round coz her neck is being held by her zombie hubby. Her car crashes into the tree and it goes on fire but Sush escapes out of the car and faints. The mad guy is very happy to see the tree in ashes and even pees in front of the tree but when he turns back the zombies are not gone. (Stupid no?).Sush wakes up in the hospital and finds her son okay and then when she picks him up the last shot of the scene shows the boy (her son) is also a zombie i.e. he died when the ghosts smacked him.All of these things are unexplained and are pretty dumb. Do not watch this movie and if you are very eager to see it... rent it on DVD or something. But i might add that the only thing worth watching is Susmita Sen and her acting (does a great job after Samay). But i sense that the director is good and should get another chance. Rating 2 out of 10" 
" an OK one time WORTH WATCHING film","5 star is good for it really it didn't seem like it wood be even a worth watch but it is. this was categorized as a scary movie..........to a 10 yr old he may pee his pants but i don't think it should for the later,this i would say because the ghosts in the movie(a Totally GRUDGE MOVIE RIP-OFF)are shown a lot of times in daytime.......that totally ruins it.....we can clearly see the white powder on the ghosts..............and lot of the movie is 'The Shining' 's RIP-Off.........i don't remember whats scenes are but some like when the kid rides the3 wheeler bicycle and the camera follows him like the same way in the shining......and the background music too was playing same.....DAMN!!!!,i would also say that the story is bit like the the shining.i didn't like the ending and the twist ain't that good too if u see the movie then i am sure ur gonna realize the fault that the director made (u will have to pay attention to know more faults .....there are a lot of faults) .....the ghosts die becoz the tree burns down becoz they wre living there but at the final shot they show that kid has become a ghost........how the hell did he get away ????i mean he should have died too after the tree burn down .it could have been better too bad it had to end like this......................The Whole movie could have been a better . but ill still rate it a worth watching film for its effort.........u don't get to see that lot scary movies in bollywood ,u get movies with stupid fake stunts with no good plot." 
" Crap ! (Spoilers)","I started cursing myself about 20 mins. after the start of the show. One tends to think what has happened to Ram Gopal Verma's quality of production. This movie certainly digressed from the main theme of horror movies - "Its supposed to scare ya !" .. Almost the entire movie is clich√©d .. there is no proper story .. and the director thinks that by adding weird sounds, it will sound scary .. you could almost guess what was going to happen next .. there is no proper story in the movie ! There should have been some history about why the tree killed people .. why did all the people decide to appear in the end together ? why could they not start the carnage earlier .. pathetic movie .. sushmita can act and she does a good job but the direction and the story is just nonsense .. "bhoot" was so much better .. I just saw exorcist (the beginning) a couple of days back and I thought it was pretty good ..Man !! the next time I go to a Ram Gopal Varma production, I'm gonna make sure I don't got for the first day show, it would be more sensible to ask someone who has already seen the movie ... it seems he is losing his touch .."
