" Excellent lesson from this new GABBAR","Awesome movie with very good lesson... Especially the climax and ending of the movie was great. "MAIN HU GABBAR". Akshay was superb, dialogues were also great. We need this kind of movies in bollywood which actually spread good and positive lesson to country. At least we can learn from them. Akshay is doing really good work, after "Oh My God", "Holiday", and "Baby" he is "back with GABBAR"... All are meaningful and sensible thoughts in them. Happy to watch these kind of movies in bollywood. All I can say that Manoj Kumar is back with new style named Akshay Kumar" 
" Gabbar Is Back","Saw #GabbarIsBack in single screen. I swear it was a thunderous experience. People were clapping and whistling and all. Nothing new in the content, it has action romance emotions comedy message and great dialogue's. If you loved Singham, Rowdy Rathore, Dabangg then you Just Cannot miss #Gabbar its a Typical Masala muvie with great message. There is one Hospital scene before the intermission which is EPIC. THAT scene is beyond exceptional. Akshay Kumar as usual is Brilliant. Classic performance by him. Sunil Grover(Guthi) is impressive. Shruti Hasan looks hot. Kareena Kapoor looks beautiful in her cameo (Teri Meri Kahani) Chitrangda is quite seductive in Kundi mat. Overall a good entertainer and this can be the first movie of 2015 to cross 100 crore. Go watch and enjoy." 
" Very good movie which will make you think..every youth should watch it.Its what we need to think , its what we need to watch ..in present scenario.","This movie will give you something to think upon..which young generation need to actually , we can't just ignore corruption.To stop it , we need to fight it not ignore it.Kinda ...exciting movie .Overall everybody's acting was good .Songs not so nice , but since that's not a love story so songs doesn't matter much.There is a scene where an auto wala returning change to Shruti telling ..there is no need for extra money since ..nobody is asking for extra money i.e bribe..Best line was that I guess in the complete movie. It gives a glance of the perfect society, if corruption stops.As a whole I liked it and would suggest you all to watch it." 
" Excellent movie !! A must watch for all !!!!!!!","What sets "Gabbar is Back" apart in the genre is its unabashedly massy tone. Here is a film about a man who decides to take charge of a social order on the brink of anarchy when all the formal faculties fail. He doesn't believe in reprimanding the corrupt. He believes in punishing them with death. Yup, this Gabbar means business. And to the character's good fortune, he is played by the very watchable Akshay Kumar. For my money and time, Akshay is by far the most complete star-actor package among contemporary A-lister heroes in Bollywood. With due respect, none of the other A-lister superstars of Bollywood have the power to sway the masses with idealistic rhetoric. It's in his eyes. Akshay makes you sit up and listen without raising his voice. Shruti Haasan, who plays a lawyer, doesn't have much to contribute. She pouts perfectly and has an unhealthy dependence on Google search. Her introductory scene in which she swoops in to deliver a baby in the backseat of Gabbar's car based on her internet research (long storyÂ… has no particular relevance to the film) is roll-your-eyes funny. Kareena Kapoor Khan in her role as Gabbar's first love isn't a knock-out portrayal, but the good news is that she just had a song cameo and was freed from mouthing any corny lines. Despite everything, the film survives to tell-a-tale that is relevant today. 'Gabbar Is Back' knocks the bottom off the action genre with a breathless ode to Swachh Bharat. P.S. Use 9xbuddy to download videos from you tube , IMDb and many more sites online :)" 
" Need more of movies like this!","Akshay Kumar is making so much sensible movies nowadays. Holiday, Baby and now "Gabbar Is Back" with a bang. This is a story of Aditya/Gabbar (Akshay Kumar), a lawyer's assistant and the hero's romantic interest Shruti (Shruti Haasan), a lowly but ambitious constable Sadhuram (Sunil Grover), a swaggering CBI officer Kuldeep Pahwa (Jaideep Ahlawat) and a villainous real estate tycoon Digvijay Patil (Suman Talwar).In era of HNY, KICK like nonsensical movies, we have some of these gems. Watch it definitely 1 time watch!Akshay Kumar is making so much sensible movies nowadays. Holiday, Baby and now "Gabbar Is Back" with a bang.

Watch it definitely 1 time watch!" 
" A masala movie that is no non-sense!","Gabbar is Back is a common man's fight against corruption. The movie justifies its name as Gabbar has been the biggest villain in Indian Cinema history. But this time Akshay Kumar adopt this name to fear the corrupts. He starts his own mission to destroy them and his way of doing so is brutal.Movie is a bit slow in parts especially in first half but it doesn't boar you to core. We feel convinced with the proceedings and can actually feel the anger against the protagonist. This is what makes this movie different from other routine mass entertainers that audience get connected to the plot. Second half is solid with some really action packed sequences. Climax is ample and we feel convinced while coming out of the theater. There are minuses in the movie as every movie has but they don't irritate you. Slow pace and loud BGM are two drawbacks.Akshay Kumar again plays the lead role quite brilliantly and after Baby , he has given another commendable job. His dialog delivery is just rocking. Action is always a plus in his movies. Shruti Haasan is cute and does her part good. The villain played by Suman is convincing. Sunil aka Gutthi is a bonus as Police officer. Kareena looks stunning in cameo while Chitrangadha is ravishing in item number.Direction by Krish is good. Story and Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Editing could've been better. Music is average with loud BGM. Cinematography is good. Action is OTT but looks good played by Akshay.Overall, GIB is a convincing movie with a storyline that would connect audience and that's where it hits bulls' eye. It would be loved by one and all as it is a true entertainer. Go for it because there are very few no Nonsense masala movies made in Bollywood and GIB is one of them. Enjoy guys!" 
" A Full-On Masala Entertainer!","A remake of the 2002 Tamil film Ramanaa, 'Gabbar is Back' is A Full-On Masala Entertainer! Its not an amazing film, but an engaging watch, nonetheless. Here's a film that's sure to work big time with the masses!'Gabbar is Back' Synopsis: A grief-stricken man takes the law into his own hands when he begins to kidnap and murder corrupt public servants.'Gabbar is Back' is high on entertainment & that honestly, does the trick. Sure, there are flaws here. The second-hour does get a bit tedious & the dialogue are unintentionally funny at times, but overall, this commercial pot-boiler hits higher on pluses than on minuses.The storyline is simple, but the treatment is crisp & interesting. The protagonist's journey to punish the evil within our society, has moments of power. I'd like to single out that terrific sequence at a hospital in the first-hour & also the nicely done climax, which delivers a message with honesty. Rajat Arora's Adapted Screenplay moves on a very fast-pace & offers some great moments. But, the second-hour isn't as good as the first-hour. Its a bit tedious & acts as a deterrent in the narrative. Even some of the dialogue, are unintentionally funny. Krish's Direction is pretty decent. Cinematography could've been better. Editing is pretty tight. Action-Sequences are excellent. Music by Various Artists, is alright.Performance-Wise: Akshay Kumar as Gabbar, is in serious from. Its so good to see the superstar donning a part, that we often don't see him in. He enacts the protagonist with admirable conviction. Shruti Haasan is wasted. Sunil Grover is a pleasant surprise here. The TV phenomena essays an important part with great energy. Suman Talwar, as the antagonist, is loud. Jaideep Ahlawat is first-rate. Ishita Vyas is sincere in a brief role. Kareena Kapoor Khan & Chitrangda Singh appear in cameos. On the whole, 'Gabbar is Back' has the potential to become a winner commercially. Go, have fun!" 
" Excellent movie","The movie was simply superb. The acting of each individual actor along with the fantastic message provided to us in the shape of gabbar is just too good. This movie is a must watch if you are tired of a corrupt government and while you see the government being rectified, you will get some solid entertainment and a laugh every now and then too. It is an inspirational movie too. Overall a must watch if your an akshay kumar fan and also a fan to see an end of a corrupt government in 2 hours and 10 minutes..." 
" Nice movie..or we say bollywood movie","Story of movie is quite good.. But not the direction.. It could be made better..but that better doesn't earn much from it.. Its a typical bollywood directed movie.. few songs with item no... It gives a great message..and of course..Akshay is fabulous in his role.. Although a much better movie ca be made with this good story.. Action of movie is up top.. But if you like bollywood masala movie..then its for you.. i'm little disappointed with he direction of movie..but overall its a good movie..don't judge this on direction scale..see the message in the movie.. and we love akshay as gabbar..he proved that he is one of the finest actor in bollywood." 
" An action film with a social theme.....","Gabbar is back is an action film with a social theme.But if you compare this film with previous Akki's social action films like Holiday and Baby then it is inferior to them.The theme of the movie is noble but its presentation is weak.The biggest problem here is the impuissant and predictable plot which has not been developed nicely.The movie raises the topic of corruption but the script of this movie itself is corrupt and heavily borrows from various movies of the genre.The script is not good enough to sustain this movie and its serious and thought provoking content.The plot also contains some loopholes.Still the entertainment quotient of the film is high,so it manages to engage you for 2 hours.The scene in the hospital,kidnapping of villain etc. are some scene which has been executed nicely.Akshay is a dynamite and if you want to know why then just watch this movie.His look and dialogue delivery is unblemished.He looks very agile in action scenes and due to his friskiness the beyond belief action sequences looks so persuasive and reliable.Shruti dances well but has nothing to do in this movie.Kareena is unexceptional in a small cameo.Sunil grover was superb.I liked his acting as he acts so believably.Jaideep was ordinary.Suman does the same things he had done before.Direction of the movie is nothing special and is ordinary.While watching the movie,i felt like i am watching a dubbed south Indian movie.Music of the film is good.The item song is sizzling.Action choreography is awesome as the action sequences are very good.Editing is also good.If a little attention was paid to the script,then the movie would have been more sharper and tenser.The climax of the movie looks like a forced one.Still the movie manages to convey the message to the audience while not being too preachy.Gabbar is nothing new but is passable flick due to its well choreographed action scenes,Akshay's amazing acting and its fast paced screenplay.If you are a fan of Akki then its a MUST WATCH for you.Otherwise its just an above average action flick which is a treat for mas-ala and hardcore action lovers.The movie was supposed to be a hard hitting social drama but fizzles due to its feeble writing.6.3 out of 10 is enough." 
" 10/10","a very entertaining movie with a powerful message.i would recommend this movie to all the people i know.the story is 10/10.acting is 10/10.i just skipped some of the songs xD.the looks and the sound of gabbar was well chosen the girls also was dressed up well. i hope every one in this world would watch the movie.that message must spread all over the world just imagine if we lived in a world free of bribe :).watch that movie i know you will enjoy it.there is only one thing that i wanted to see, but i cant say what is it lol :)." 
" Gabbar Is Back has right intention with Akshay Kumar ruling the roost","Akshay Kumar is one such star who has been entertaining the Bollywood film industry for 25 years and yet his choice of selecting films has been subjective with classic thuds like Once Upon in Mumbai Dobara, Joker , Khiladi 786, Its Entertainment and The Shaukeens to name few. Fortunately, Holiday and BABY were breath-taking. The good news is Gabbar Is Back , though follows the trend of 90's potboilers which comprises of action, melodrama , routine song and dance, has right intention with raw-punching dialogues, commendable action scenes and of course Akshaye Kumar.Gabbar ( Akshay Kumar) is a fearless social activist with depressing past who bumps off corrupted elements of the society to bring justice to the innocent and helpless peopleFirst time director in Hindi cinema , Krish gives a popcorn masala entertainment with a good message. At the beginning, you are greeted with unnecessary insertion of characters and half-baked romantic track. The movie unravels the moral story and it starts making sense with each scene.The second half is extremely intense with punching dialogues and melodrama taking over. Few scenes do stand out - the hospital scene is brilliantly executed , the climax is impacting. The screenplay does have loopholes but few to be remembered once you leave the theater. These kind of cinemas are generally adored by the masses who loves to whistle to introduction scene of their hero, clap to the item songs and shout as their hero punches the villain. Similarly, Gabbar has everything going in its favor. The humongous entry by Akshay Kumar, the brilliant fight sequence captured in slow motion ( though sometimes larger-than- life) and good storyline. Songs are the major disappointment. Art direction is plain and cinematography is ordinary. Gabbar completely belongs to Akshay Kumar and the actor does not leave any stone unturned. He gives his best and proves his mettle with good performance. Shruti Hassan over-acts and should work on her expressions being in the industry for so many years.Overall, Gabbar Is Back has right intention with Akshay Kumar ruling the roost. Good 3/5" 
" Main Hoon Gabbar","I was tired of watching Akshay Kumar's tiring comedy movies but I can happily say that after some non sense movies like HNY, you get to see a movies full of action, lovely music, awesome dialogue delivery and Sunil Grover as Constable Sadhu PERFECT he was more like a detective then a cop he worked every detail of this case like he was investigating from every single angle. After watching and loving Akshay Kumar's performance in BABY get to see him in a good serious role as GABBAR at total Paisa Vasool Masala Movie everything is perfect. These are the kind of movies that Akshay Kumar needs to do, Serious Movies with a message "Corruption mat lena nahin to Gabbar aajega." 
" Gabbar is Back","Akshay Kumar is indubitably the undisputed king of 'zimbly' south remakes which have been raking in the dough in Bollywood.And producer like Sanjay Leela Bhansali who tasted a giant dash of success with Rowdy Rathore,leaves no stone unturned to make his venture a money spinner with the action star in the lead.With a title that alludes to Bollywood's most remembered antagonist, this film stages the dashing Kumar as an undercover vigilante, punishing the corrupt officials in our society.A remake of the 2002 Tamil super-hit film Ramanna, Gabbar is back's premise feels a bit outdated mostly because of its semblance with films like Ungli and Kick.Here is a common man with a death wish, who is remorselessly wronged by the establishment. Akshay is professor Aditya in the daylight who teaches his student the five forces (and applies them on the goons too!) and the elusive Gabbar in the dark who punishes the bribe seekers to death.As he tag-lines his name himself " Naam Villain Ka, Kaam hero ka",Gabbar has an efficient underground army who kidnap the corrupt guys from every department , causing a predictable unrest among the policemen.In his long drawn modus to reform the system, Gabbar locks horns with a very powerful industrialist,Digvijay(Suman Talwar) who apparently has a notion that he is a big brand and can manipulate anybody and anything.Director Krish forays into Hindi cinema and crafts 'Gabbar' with all the solid ingredients of a commercial potboiler, but everything about the movie feels a lot exaggerated.The back-story which involves the gorgeous looking Kareena with only a song sequence lacks the emotional punch and the constant bullying of Sunil Grover, who does a sincere job, by his seniors is overwhelming.Equally disappointing is the way in which the leading lady, Shruti Haasan is positioned a dim-wit lawyer who spends half of her time rattling off google trivia.Yet, its a decent fare constantly watchable because of its leading hero,Akshay, and his inimitable energy and persona.Though he looks bit exhausted with that salt-n-pepper beard, the clap-trap one-liners(Rajat Arora) do the trick.Each dialogue is a punchline, paying homage to the cult character of Sholay.Another shortcoming is the strong counterpoint that Gabbar's nemesis , played by Suman Talwar , fails to offer.Challenged by the script, he doesn't exude the menacing vibe that Akshay needed to combat.The treatment obviously resonates a highly outrageous and impragmatic solution, and the message that it disseminates is risky to fathom.It is okay if you don't take them very seriously and enjoy it as a classy masala flick.Fans of Akki - this one is for you ! Rating : 3/5" 
" Been There, Done That. â™¦ 33%","I could bet this is the nth time a film based on the theme of a common man turning into a city vigilante is made. Although I am not quite sure of the purpose of creating such movies, Gabaar is Back is no different from its previous/similar versions.A good guy who tried to fight with the bad guy ends up almost dead after his pregnant wife is also killed in an unrelated incident. Years later, the good guy, now convalesced and fit and fine, starts an underground vigilante group, hiring fellow students who he thinks has the ability to change the way the bureaucracy works (in India). Plus, a girl who had been roaming around the studio (while the film shooting) for a role was given to play the character of a girl who I have not yet been able to fathom the necessity of.The protagonist constantly repeats "Gabbar is back!" so as to reiterate the fact, which may be to wake up the audience if the ennui had rendered them dead asleep. The plot is straight preachy and deals with giving us superficial pleasure to know that corruption has finally been wiped off the tables. But once you get out of the theater, you may still get anxious that tomorrow you have that police verification for the issue of passport where you will need to grease few hands. Unfortunately, Gabbar is fictitious and will stay that way. If one fails to realize that, the film is a definite 10 on 10.Even a fourth grader could guess who plays the characters I have mentioned above, so I won't go over it. Their performances were fine, and there's nothing much to talk about, except maybe Kumar; he does a better job and the three stars are for him. Shruti Haasan acts like she was handed a textbook and asked simply to read.BOTTOM LINE: Gabbar is Back uses the same old formula where the common man turns into a rebellious smart-Aleck who suddenly has the skills of a martial artist-wrestler crossover and brains of a genius. The only difference is he's trying to eradicate corruption this time; its sequel will deal with attacks on women, and betel-nut- chewing Bhansali tells my sources that "Gabbar will be back after he makes love with his Girlfriend (2034)" will deal with selfie stick abuse and android sex. 3/10 - avoidable.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
