" Another Ripoff But Some Great Performances by the Women","In general, the movie is about a seemingly happily married couple (but yet there are hints of a hidden secret) who's life is interrupted when an ex lover contacts the husband and decides to take him to Goa to visit their son about whom the husband was not aware of until recently. Confusing? Neither of them has seen the son and the ex-girlfriend has just released herself a mental institution after 12 years.Some DVD versions have an incorrect synopsis in the back of the cover. It was originally a misleading preview written by one of the worst movie critics Trash Adarsh on his website Indiafm. The movie actually is completely different from what he states. Ria wasn't schizophrenic. She had borderline personality disorder with bipolar symptoms. If you're wondering which movie the director shamelessly ripped-off, then that would be 'Forever Lulu'. Shashi Ranjan proves to be a pathetic director for ruthlessly plagiarizing almost every frame of 'Forever Lulu'. 'Dobara' is slightly slow-paced during the first hour. In the second half, the screenplay loses focus by introducing a sudden twist. It's also weird that Raveena's character all of a sudden does not need any medication for her chronic condition. Such flaws are amateurish and could have easily been avoided. 'Dobara' would have been a more interesting flick had it only stayed focused on the three main characters. The strength of the movie is the superb acting by the women. Both Raveena Tandon and Mahima Chaudhry gave outstanding performances. The chemistry and display of ambivalence between them is amazing. Jackie Shroff is boring at times otherwise he is okay at best. He's a miscast and a too old to be paired opposite Mahima and Raveena in a role like this. The songs are likable and appropriately fitted into the film as it provides a break from the slow pace. I hope at least those weren't ripped off.Overall, Mahima Chaudhry and Raveena Tandon's performances deserve to be acknowledged but Shashi Ranjan gets no positive praise from me because he is nothing but a hack." 
" Decent acting, dull movie","Dobara is one of those movies that are short in comparison to most other Indian movies, but still appear to be longish. The story is pretty thin: Ranbir and Anjali are a happily married couple, and then suddenly out of nowhere appears Ranbir's ex Ria, who has just escaped from a mental asylum. Ria wants everything to be like it used to be, and tries to manipulate an unwilling Ranbir into renewing their relationship. That's about a last thing Ranbir is waiting for, but because Ria claims she and Ranbir have a son of thirteen, he decides to go with her anyway and meet him in Goa. A jealous Anjali follows them. For a while, the story revolves around the question whether this son is real or imaginary, followed by a not particularly imaginative or unexpected twist, and at last all players are best buddies and Ria is miraculously cured. The question of the true nature of Ria's disease is left unanswered, and apparently there's wasn't much research done about the subject. In other words, the whole thing is way too boring for a fairytale, and way too improbable for a story about a mentally diseased woman.That said, the three protagonists did a bang-up job. Jackie Shroff is very a gifted actor, who played his part naturally and convincingly. Same can be said about Mahima Chaudhry, an actress who deserves much more recognition than she is actually getting. Raveena Tandon had her great moments too, although at times she was gravely overacting. However decent the acting may be, it doesn't weigh up against a weak and little exciting story. Since visually and musically this movie has little to offer either, I'm sure it doesn't add anything of value to anybody's film collection, unless he is a special fan of one of the actors." 
" Complete lift from a wonderful Hollywood Flick","This Movie, Even though with good actors and their performances is nothing but a complete rip of a good Hollywood Flick - FOREVER LULU. Jackie's role is done by Patrick Swayze ( Which i must say is far better than what we just saw in this One), Mahima has played the role of Penelope Ann Miller and Raveena Tondon has Played the role of Malelie Griffith ( You must see Forever Lulu to see the real acting of a Psychic women ).I Just cant believe it when i saw this movie today !!! Not even a single plot has been changed from the original Movie.Though i thought it was a good time pass to see it on Cable TV.. But i Must tell All the viewers to pls see the original movie as the Acting, and the ending song were just too good to be missed..." 
" Good story, good performances, good enough","This movie was barely publicized at all, and I never really heard about it. This movie is one of those "best kept secrets." Despite the fact the cast comprises of fading stars, the film has a really fresh feel to it. First of all, none of these actors have been seen in a really long time. Second, there isn't any "filmi" nonsense, melodrama, unnecessary characters, foreign locales, etc. The movie focuses strictly on its story, the most critical aspect of any film. Raveena is mind-blowing. Not talked about too often, she once again displays her talent and graceful beauty very well. Likewise, Mahima also does a great job. I have no idea why she is still struggling to get popularity. I've always liked her performances. Jackie Shroff does a lame job as usual. It's nice to see a straightforward, mature love story after a long time. All the characters are excellently developed! Alisha, another long-forgotten talent, sings a nice song." 
" Good performance from Raveena Tandon","A good movie but not excellent. The songs in the movies are not brilliant and I think could have been edited out. Raveena Tandon again shows what are great and underrated actress she is but I would have liked to see more of her escape from the mental institute and how come she just suddenly stopped taking her medicine. Mahima Chaudry also performs well but her role does not require the histronics that Raveena's does but she still makes her presence felt. As usual Jackie Shroff is wooden he delivers his lines without any emotion. The story is interesting but drags in parts. The ending of the movie is quite good and the movie raised awareness of Raveena's illness. It was an interesting watch and not the usual commercial pot boiler. This movie gets a 7/10 from me."
