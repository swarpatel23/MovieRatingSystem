" Watch it for both Uday & Priyanka but don't expect a college romance out of it.","Here is another example of a reasonably fine movie presented with completely wrong promos and a misleading promotional campaign. And the strange thing is that the blunder is once again committed by the experienced Yash Raj Films who did exactly the same with their earlier project "Rocket Singh". Simply putting, "Pyaar Impossible" is neither a youthful movie about college life nor it talks about any campus affairs as prominently shown in its on-air promos.Conversely, it is a simple story of a one-sided love affair, also featuring a girl child artist playing a prominent role in the script and has a story-line, which somehow seems to be less appealing for the younger audiences. So, if you are expecting a trendy, college campus love flick, featuring a geek and a beauty, then you are sure going to be disappointed big time. But the saving grace is that the movie still manages to impress the viewers to some extent, mainly through its engaging second half, where the plot actually starts moving at the much needed speed. Whereas before intermission, the narration has nothing great to offer and you just keep waiting for something more interesting to happen on the screen very soon.Basically, I am still wondering why Jugal Hansraj (director) and Uday Chopra, who has also written the story, screenplay and dialogues for the movie, opted for such confusing promos for their project, which no-where talk about the real movie in the offering. In fact all the scenes in the promos on-air are just taken from the first 15 minutes of the movie and the rest is completely left untouched. To be precise, I couldn't figure out, what was the purpose of promoting the movie as a college drama, when its main lead female character is actually a divorcée single mother living alone with her kid girl. That was really a silly attempt to bring in the young crowd into the theaters to fetch a good initial. However, the move may turn against the movie, since all the youngsters are not going to find the content they were really feeling excited for. Jugal Hansraj once again misses the bull's eye with even Priyanka being there for him as a merit.Nevertheless, apart from this publicity goof up, "Pyaar Impossible" is a decent movie with worth watching performances from the lead pair and the girl child. Priyanka Chopra once again leads from the front, with her stunning outfits and gorgeous looks. Her solid portrayal of a stylish and educated single mother, rightly proves why she is considered as one of the best talents we currently have in our Hindi Cinema. Uday Chopra as her silent lover, surprisingly gives a stunner performance in the role of a geek. He is simply not the same Uday, you may recall from his previous films. He has not only grown as an actor but also showcases his other talents of writing and scripting a story of his own. Advika Yadav, the kid girl playing Priyanka's daughter is a delight to watch and a talent to look out in the future. Anupam Kher is lovable in his few scenes and Dino Morea is quite impressive in his negative role.Musically, the film has majority of its songs written partly in English which have a limited appeal. Music directors Salim-Sulieman have worked more on their song arrangements and less on the melody part of their musical score. Hence, though the tracks sound good but they don't stay in your mind for long. Cinematography captures Singapore's outdoor locations skillfully.In a nutshell review, "Pyaar Impossible" is a good one time watch mainly for its performances, but it has nothing as suggested by its trendy and youthful promos. The movie is based on an urban subject revolving around computer software and its piracy which strictly makes it a multiplex movie and can work only in the metros. You can watch it for both Priyanka and Uday but don't expect any college romance out of it." 
" Great talented movie not your typical Bollywood "masala" film","This film is one of the few in recent years which is beginning to demonstrate Indian films are evolving beyond stereotype boy-girl romantic film. I was totally amazed by the story-line, acting by Priyanka, Udhay and especially the little girl who was just mind-blowing in the film. I was little puzzled by Priyanka's skimpy outfit in the movie, which I think considering how beautiful she looks didn't necessarily need to wear such short clothes :o) But this doesn't take away fact the film was awesomely executed and was so natural. The unique idea Geeky Udhay had in his role of a multi-operating system was amazing. I have, in general, found Udhay Chopra a poor actor but this film changed my opinion about him by 360-degres. If I am correct he wrote this film then he did an amazing job as a writer.A truly entertaining film." 
" Pyaar Impossible - a sweet romantic comedy!","First off, I really enjoyed watching the film. It is a very simple yet sweet romantic comedy. It delivers great direction and performances by all the leading cast and an impressive sound track.In some point of time, everyone has experienced unattainable love. 'Pyaar Impossible' definitely shows that with a remarkable love story narrated through Abhay Sharma (Uday Chopra) about the love of his life Alisha Merchant (Priyanka Chopra). A story about a geek who is in love with a beautiful girl totally out of his league.Uday Chopra as Abhay Sharma - loved his acting, fit the role of a Geek perfectly. Uday Chopra has definitely made a strong comeback.Priyanka Chopra as Alisha Merchant - one of the finest Bollywood actress of this generation. Great acting and also looks super gorgeous throughout the movie.Dino Morea as Sidhu (alias Varun) - Lived up to his role, also does a fine job as the villain.The songs are well-portrayed to emphasize the love between the beauty and the geek. The background score was also fantastic!Overall, I enjoyed watching the film. A film that can surely connect with the younger Bollywood audience through its simple love story.9/10 Must Watch" 
" Mind Blowing","Well, i didn't expect it to be, but it was brilliant and mind blowing! The performances and direction were fantastic! UDAY CHOPRA's screenplay was good, his dialogues seemed very fresh, and ordinary (not in a bad way) but the dialogues had a realistic look rather than a filmy look! The story was not really original and has been shown in Hindi movies before, Rab ne bana di jodi, Jaan-e-man, etc! But the way JUGAL HANSRAJ handled the subject, should be appreciated! His direction was fantastic! PRIYANKA CHOPRA'S acting got better than before and her acting was really good! BUT THE BEST OF ALL WAS THE LITTLE GIRL WHO PLAYED PRIYANKA'S DAUGHTER! I think she's JUGAL HANSRAJ's daughter because she looks like him! Her acting was the best thing in the movie! UDAY CHOPRA's acting was classic! SALIM SULAIMAN's music was nice! Background score was good! DINO MOREA was good as a villain.POINTS.DIRECTION 10/10.ACTING 10/10.DIALOGUES 10/10.SCREENPLAY 10/10.MUSIC 10/10.LYRICS 10/10.CINEMATOGRAPHY 10/10.Overall, You should go watch the movie for sure! If you like watching realistic films with full entertainment, then this is the one for you! If you like films with a message, this one is for you! If you like good cinema, this is for you! In short, this is for all of us.Therefore, GO WATCH IT IN THEATRES!!!!! DVD IS NOT THAT FUN, TRUST ME!! I WATCHED IT FIRST DAY FIRST SHOW AND IT WAS WORTH IT!!!!! :)" 
" A Nutshell Review: Pyaar Impossible","There are many reasons why I had opted to watch this film. First off, it's Uday Chopra, an actor whom I confess only having watch his comical sidekick roles in the Dhoom movies, so I was curious whether he can carry a film off on his own as a leading man. The answer is of course yes, as he plays the geek Abhay right down to the pat, a man who had been infatuated with the hottest girl in school for seven years, always afraid to open his mouth and talk to her, given an opportunity to do so when in pursuit of a software thief, he travels to Singapore and serendipity dictates he will bump into his infatuation, and even more incredibly get to work as her precocious, feisty daughter's nanny. Not to mention too that this story and dialogues are credited under Uday himself, so one wonders where he had drawn his inspiration from, whether he had actually pined for someone like his character did in the film.Second, the other lead in actress Priyanka Chopra. There are plenty of naysayers to her credibility as an actress, but from what I watched last year from Fashion right down to Ashutosh Gowariker's What's Your Rashee (missed Kaminey!), she had shown her versatility and wide range, which the brickbrats would still like to point out in the latter film, was nothing more than a change of clothes and hairstyles, which I totally disagree. Her performance here as Alisha, the single, divorced mother and Abhay's girl of his dreams, would once again become a showcase of her ability, despite yet again looking great in the various outfits which would raise an eyebrow whether it's appropriate corporate office attire (and overheard from another audience member too that her outfits wouldn't pass). That aside, I would think that this "mum" role is probably her first (unless someone can point out to me that I'm wrong please?)And one of the key reasons, is how Singapore gets portrayed in another Bollywood film, after the comedy De Dana Dan last year, which didn't really move around much other than for one of the song sequences and being stuck mostly within the confines of the Pan Pacific Hotel. Then there was Krrish which also starred Priyanka Chopra, making this at least her 2nd film foray to our sunny island. In this film, Singapore's good enough to become that substitute for California's beaches thanks to Sentosa, and I always get a good laugh out of how our cabbies get unwittingly portrayed as dishonest cheats who take tourists for a ride around expressways and the city area no thanks to the juxtaposition of scenes involving recognizable roads and landmarks. Or that this travel scene would become one of those sponsored tourism campaign videos.While identification of landmarks use adds to the fun, such as the UOB skyscraper doubling up as the HQ of Pinnacle Software, and various shots in Challenger, Clarke and Robertson Quay areas, what I found more interesting is how, so far, there's rarely a depiction of HDB apartments in movies shot here by Bollywood. Everyone's pretty loaded in their ability to afford a swanky condo (at the Kallang Bay area, given the view out of their windows) in Krrish's case, or landed property in this one, that cost a few million dollars at the very least. So while local films tend to depict the accommodation here using what some 80% of the locals live in, films from abroad may, perhaps due to non-familiarity, opt to go by the more conventional (sometimes unrealistic) route of the "house" concept.In any case, Pyaar Impossible is about the improbable love between a beauty and a geek, and Uday Chopra's story is rather straightforward, revenge of the nerd type, which somehow works fine as a magical fantasy romantic story that's kept simple and effective, without much fuss. There are essentially three story arcs, one which is the unattainable love that Abhay seeks, the second being Abhay as The Nanny / Butler / Confidant to Alisha's household, and the third giving cause for Abhay to visit Singapore, in search of the swindler Sidhu/Varun (Dino Morea).With its catchy tunes and song and dance routine, it hit the nail on the head when the theme song succinctly dealt with the notion of how superficial it actually is when we talk about attraction, but always fail to admit so. In that respect, Pyaar Impossible laid its cards out on the table honestly even though it had to succumb to formula, and I'd pick this romantic comedy over any Hollywood one any day." 
" Uday Chopra Returns!","'Pyaar Impossible' is a surprise packet, in fact, this year's first decent film is in the form of this Uday Chopra flick. A film that truly springs a surprise! I enjoyed 'Pyaar Impossible' from start to end. It's a neat & clean film, that has it's heart at the right place. A simple story told in a simple.Uday Chopra has done it all, he's written the story, the dialogs, done the acting. And thank god, he does well in every department. Jugal Hansraj's direction is neat. The cinematography by Santhosh Thundyil's is perfect. Music is good, so are the lyrics.Acting wise, Uday does well in a role, that he knew he would do well in. Priyanka is very sincere; plus she looks awesome in both hairstyles. Dino excels as a villain. The talented actor should do such roles also, so that people finally give him his due. Anupam Kher, is, as always, excellent. The kid who plays Priyanka's daughter is first-rate.Any minuses: Yes, the film could've done without a song or two. Otherwise, Na not much.'Pyaar Impossible' is a film that I recommend you to watch." 
" Actually better than I expected","I recently got into bollywood movies with my first helping 'Bodyguard' which I found to be a very sweet comedy and Salman Khan as definitely come of age. When I saw Priyanka Chopra in an interview I was particularly enamored by her presence and beauty. It's no wonder she was previously a coveted winner of Miss World back in 2000. However, acting is a whole different story and Mrs. Aishwarya Rai also a former 1994 Miss World winner has proved that beauty pageants can also make it into acting.Having been in the movie industry for a number of years now, Priyanka Chopra has again proved to the critics that she is a very capable actress and shows her versatility in this movie. She plays a very motivated young woman who was always looking for thrills and spills and falls for the wrong person, the product of which is a single mum with a young daughter. Come on the heels of Priyanka is a an unassuming, mild mannered geek who has quietly been in love with her from college days. One day through fate they meet up again in life and the story uncoils around their unexpected relationship.I am a bit puzzled by the low rating this movie has received since I thought it was very entertaining. One thing I need to add is that you cannot watch Bollywood movies with any 'seriousness'. The story is always usually fantastic and unbelievable but thats what gives it some magic as all the movie fans consisting of over half the world will testify. If you really want to judge movies on technical merit, film worthiness, realism etc. then we have many of the western movies for that, but for pure light-hearted entertainment, then you cannot go wrong with this one." 
" Predictable, but charming","No deep story, just a predictable, but cute, charming story. I had no intention of watching it all the way through, but I found the characters charming, and after I watched it, found myself walking around the house singing the music.The most interesting thing to me was the statement this film makes on India pop culture -- the language a blend of English and Hindi, probably from the impact of American movies and pop culture, and also from the out-sourcing of software support jobs to India, ala, Bill Gates.One final comment: I read a news review by an American film critic, criticizing the film for nepotism. How silly! You want the government to take over film making also? You can't hire your relatives to work on your own film? I'm sorry, but I think private biz should be able to hire whomever it wants, related or not. I would prefer to have people I enjoyed working with and trust on my set, related or not." 
" Beauty and the geek done right","First, this is a warm feel good movie much like pictures of kittens and puppies. If that is not your cup of tea, then skip it. The story of the geek winning over the girl has been done before, but the humor in this movie makes it a winner. Abhay's (Uday Chopra) social awkwardness is a winner here and Alisha's (Priyanka Chopra) roll as a sexy socialite oblivious to Abhay's geek world is perfect. The antics Uday goes through to win her and her monster daughter over is funny and the turn in the end is sweet and awesome. Some of the humor is dumb (including the bad wig on Anupam Kher's head), but fits right in. The music is catchy and keeps you taping your feet. There is a small underlying story of being able to see the world differently from another point of view and it is well done (Priyanka makes a hot geek!). Some of the dialog is a little boring and almost seems like the actors are ad-libbing some lines at times, but it is saved by the humor in the story. I will watch this again and again and is one of my favorites. A perfect family film for all ages." 
" Mission Impossible","Directed by Jugal Hansraj and written by Uday Chopra, Pyaar Impossible is painfully predictable, and offers nothing original in it's writing or treatment.Pyaar Impossible doesn't work because it's hard to empathize with any of the characters and because the actors fail to rise above the flawed script. It's back-breakingly long at two hours and twenty-odd minutes, and I can't remember one single scene that made me smile. The humour is ordinary, and the pre-climax romantic scene in a Mac store is the most embarrassing I can remember in recent times. On more occasions than one, the makers compromise basic common sense to deliver scenes that are offensive or plain dangerous. To be entirely honest, I didn't quite understand what the film was trying to say in the first place. That beauty isn't skin deep and that there's more to love than just surface-level attraction? I suppose that's why Alisha ends up with Abhay in the end. But why doesn't the same logic apply to his interest in her? After all I can't think of one reason why anyone would be drawn to Alisha if it isn't for her beauty – she's pretty harebrained, she's not a responsible mother, she has a fake accent, and she dresses like a tart. If you ask me, Abhay's too good for her." 
" I love this full movie","Great movie just love Priyanka Chopra
Keep showing comedy films" 
" review","I am surprised by the low rating of this beautiful film, I saw a different film about you First the story was very good and dramatic par excellence and the performance of the heroine Vantha was thin and amazing And do not forget the hero as a shy person socially who added great value to the work The events were wonderful and the end was at the level" 
" Great movie, great soundtrack","OK, I don't like to give anything a 10. But this movie and now soundtrack has really touched me on a personal level. It was such a moving film. I just loved it.I'm not going to give anything away as I truly believe this movie will really touch every romantic out there. Now the funny thing is I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. It was 3am and I had absolutely nothing else to do. I put it on and almost turned it off after about 5 minutes. I thought it so strange that it had to be a complete waste of time.Then the first song came on and it was pretty cool. So I decided to give it a few minutes. And here I am typing a review for a movie that I almost turned off and giving it a perfect 10! Then I watched it with my wife. She had the same thoughts a few minutes in but at the end she just loved it.When I bought the sound track and started playing it for my friends, she was completely embarrassed but they liked it. And as I continued to play it in my limo, she wasn't bothered by it.Then here I am at 3:45 am in the morning after going out drinking and I put the sound track on the computer and we started dancing.Now 2 drunk people dancing to some strange song that they hardly understand may not be that unusual but it is for us.This movie really touched us and if you really are a romantic and love a good romantic movie, this is it.This coming from a white guy from Chicago, IL. I throw that out there because if you watch, you'll understand. There are culture differences that don't really mix all that well with U.S. films. Anyways, it's time for me to sleep now. I really did love this film and I hope those who made it will keep up the good work.Unbelievably sad this was not a wide release in the U.S. I never even heard of it before seeing it on Netflix.If anyone has any questions, I can be contacted at Steve@affsi.net.Thank you to those who made this amazing film. I think I'll watch it for a 3rd time. Thanks." 
" Shut the Front Door!","What an interesting way to swear! Yet another romcom from YashRaj I was dreading what to expect- the usual safe as houses mediocrity that the production studio is known for. And mediocrity was what I got but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.Pyaar Impossible is at time funny and sweet but annoying at times and definitely not endearing. If anyone watches this more than twice...see a doctor because a classic it isn't! The cast of characters weren't bad. I'm not a fan of uday chopra at all but he had that sort of nerdy quality that the role required- thank Goodness he didn't try to be a uber hero like some nerdy romcom movies that I've had the misfortune to watch. Priyanka was decent- not over the top but nothing worthy of dramatic praise. Dino oozed just the right amount of sleaze and arrogance to want to you root for Uday...The flaws...too many....The plot for instance...Uday's 7 year unrequited love???! That makes him a super loser and there is no way you can empathize with Uday's character, unless you've been a super nerd in high school and university and did everyone's homework...very clichéd! And the idea of the most beautiful girl on campus being one girl...is pathetic...something that is typical bollywood...And to make that an ideology at an American university where there are in all probabilities hundreds of beautiful girls...Bollywood "directors" really need to retire this notion...it's so yesterday and so droll! Priyanka's character is a divorced single working mother, who dresses like she's going to the mall for shopping instead of the head of the PR department. She's also supposed to be a loving mother but we never really see her spend time with her daughter, and she's somehow comfortable leaving her kid in the hands of man who she has no clue about and no background checks on...very trusting mother...I'm sure that really works well in today's society! The little girl was annoying at first but thankfully her role was minimized after a while.Well, the plot could have been a lot worse but nevertheless it's still watchable. The songs are forgettable- if you want better songs watch Jashnn or Bachna Ae Haseeno.The ending has some very cringe worthy and clichéd moments that you could easily predict but the moments, at least some of them, leading up to the finale make the movie watchable." 
" Horrible movie, skip it","Garbage. Such a weak story, not even funny or fun. Very predictable and the premise of it all is just very annoying. I wish I had never watched it what a waste of time. The songs were horrible also so basically this movie has nothing going for it at all. That's kind of sad. I don't know what they were thinking but they obviously weren't thinking clearly. Hopefully they never make a movie out of a script like this again but I mean that's really impossible especially these days. Good movies are hard to come by especially good Hindi movies. What can you do? Nothing really, just gotta watch it and waste your time I guess. 1 Out of 10 and I hope no one wastes their money on this movie." 
" What has happened to Yash raj Films?","When i was growing up i used to wait for Yash Raj Films movies every year.They made so many classics and that used to be a great experience.But times have changed and i guess the quality of movie under this banner has been compromised drastically .Uday Chopra is following footsteps of Kishan Kumar (T-series) he is not Giving up on Acting. An Humble request to him please stop wasting your family's hard earned money and stop defaming the Chopra's. Its a Hollywood style love story ,shot overseas ,story is good but due to the star cast fails to catch any attention.Rated 4 for Priyanka Chopra's looks and Anupam Kher."
