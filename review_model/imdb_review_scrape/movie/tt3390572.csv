" A Hauntingly Adept Cinematic Masterpiece","HAIDER to me is an acronym that means the following:H. Haunting. Be it in its background score, music, lyrics, playback (especially Rekha Bharadwaj, Sukhwinder Singh, and Arijit Singh), cinematography, or backdrop of Kashmir in 1995, Haider is Haunting, and how! The film will stay with you long after you have left the theater.A. Astounding. Haider is an astoundingly adept adaptation of a classic written almost 415 years ago that can be enjoyed irrespective of your knowledge about the Shakespearean Tragedy - Hamlet. If you don't know Hamlet, great! You do? Even better! I. Incredible. Haider is incredible - in terms of its performances. Be it that of Shahid Kapoor (Haider/Hamlet) who performs a complex role with the kind of award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once and for all. Or for that matter the the triumvirate of Tabu (Halala/Gertrude) - ethereal, dauntless, and supreme, Kay Kay Menon (Khurram/Claudius) - terrific, resolute, and subtle or Irfan Khan (Rooh/The Ghost of Hamlet's father) - rudimentary and underplayed. Not to be forgotten is Shraddha Kapoor (Aarshi/Ophelia) who pitches in a performance that is 'picture'esque perfect and so full of finesse. And of course the two Salman Khan's who are fans of the superstar and who will surely gain some fans of their own post this film. In fact, every single member of the cast pitches in a perfect performance here, irrespective of the role and duration.D. Daring. Haider is daring in talking about issues that many wouldn't touch with a bargepole and for the way it has juxtaposed a Shakespearean tragedy with a human tragedy - Kashmir. The valley is a character here that finally finds a voice of its own. The interpretations of that voice are truly brilliant.E. Effective. Sometimes experimentation and reinterpretations fail. Not here. With layer upon layer waiting for the audience to be interpreted (for example the touch of Oedipal complex between a mother and son, the growing of guilt of a well meaning lover, the song of the gravediggers, the examples of 'Chutzpah' and its comparison with AFSPA etc). Haider is effective on multiple levels and truly faultless in its execution.R. Rooh (Spirit/Soul). This is a film with an indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die to include in their body of work, and which Vishal Bharadwaj effectively manages to in this lifetime. This film has that which many a masterpiece may sometimes lack - a soul. A terrific triumph encompassing its soulful music, soul stirring performances, and soul warming message.In short - watch Haider - in a theater. For Vishal Bharadwaj, the Director/Composer/Writer. For Shahid, the rising prince. For Tabu the eternal Queen. For Gulzar, the lyricist. For the cinematography by Pankaj Kapoor and the editing by Aarif Sheikh. And finally for Kashmir, the unforgettable voice of humanity." 
" Best movie of 2014","When films transmute William Shakespeare's poetic imagery and the atmosphere that his verses conjure into re-imagined, re- contextualized visuals, and not merely reproduce the action with select dialogues, a movie adaptation of a Shakespeare play can be considered successful. That is why, thought British film scholar Roger Manvell, Shakespeare often translates best in what he considered "foreign films". The setting is one of the reasons Haider, Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet, works. It is true to the haunting ambiguity of the characters' motives in the original play, Shakespeare's most opaque of tragedies, but the Kashmir canvas is potent. Bhardwaj's visual intelligence and the screenplay by Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer, one of India's acute commentators on Kashmir, his home state, add to the effective localization. Shakespearean purism aside, Haider is a thrilling film. It is a film of luxuriant paranoia. It is about Oedipal love. Unlike the cardboard insurgency imagery or images of damaged beauty that soak most films about Kashmir, Haider is an unflinching take on the Kashmir malaise, the tragedy infused with a sense of dark humor about the ordinary Kashmiri's hopelessness. Compared to Bhardwaj's earlier two Shakespeare adaptations, Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello), both of which depended heavily on language and dialogues and used Shakespeare's stories rather conveniently to propel the plot, Haider is a quieter yet richer spectacle and a convincing standalone piece. Bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection, and in that sense, Haider is in the tradition of mainstream Hindi cinema. The picturization of songs is riveting to watch (Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is breathtaking throughout, and especially in the songs) and the songs are some of Bhardwaj's best compositions as a music director in recent times. The melodrama towards the end loosens the narrative and the last half hour feels like a bit of a drag, again a typical affliction in Hindi films. The protagonist is far from the melancholy Dane; Haider, which Shahid Kapoor plays with impressive zest and inventiveness, is more a dashing, combustible figure than a brooder. Bhardwaj also does away with the supernatural horror so integral to the original play, and which can be an easy tool for creating suspense and drama in cinema. The horror is in the everyday macabre reality of death, loss and waiting, and in the manipulation of a Kashmiri Muslim's emotions and insecurities. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in the Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, has disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation. His idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered. When Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man with a limp sends him a message from his lost father, Haider is on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Central to the story is the relationship between Ghazala and Haider— a tender as well as anguished bond between mother and son, fueling the film as essentially an Oedipal drama. The romantic love between Arshi and Haider is almost a sweet afterthought. The casting ideas work impressively well. Kay Kay Menon stands out as a superbly calculating man, the villain in Haider's mind, and Tabu makes a heart-rending Ghazala. Shraddha Kapoor delivers an earnestly fervent performance and Irrfan Khan is pitch perfect as a quietly menacing presence, the only personification close to a ghostly apparition. Salman Khan is here too, in a deliciously manufactured ode to the Hindi film hero through Salman and Salman, Haider's friends and a pair of all-round crooks, an interesting replication of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from the original play. Haider is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare—and the film's biggest triumph is that the provincial, in this case Kashmir and the characters defined by its reality, shine in a universal and timeless tragedy" 
" Haider: Literature on screen. 'Bard'waj's best!","So, hours after I have finished watching the best movie to have come out this year( by a margin), I am finally in a condition to write anything about it. I am going to stick my neck out and say, Haider is the best work of Vishal Bhardwaj till date. There is no doubt, that for a story driven by passion, revenge, love and power, where emotional dispute forms the core of it, no land other than Kashmir, which has been living under the clouds of dispute ever since, would have been a better choice as the setting for the adaptation. The film is haunting and engrossing. It seamlessly adapts Hamlet and at the same time creates unforgettable characters of its own and makes us see a complex world through their eyes. I can't recall any other film which has completely been shot in the valley and surely none depicting it in all it's glory. The film takes off with the event around which the actions of all the the players of the movie would revolve. One gets only the first hour to get to know the basic nature of the characters as platform for the mind blowing second half is being built. At the cusp of the interval when an ever assured Irrfan Khan makes an intriguing entry, you only get a hint of things to come. The second half unleashes on you Shahid Kapur, who for the first time in his career shows glimpses of Pankaj Kapur. Those three minutes ( you would know which when you watch it ) where Shahid displays what all he is capable of, are those you would want to watch again and again. Kay Kay Menon is now a veteran and he doesn't disappoint.The only weak link to this extraordinary cast could have been Shraddha Kapoor, but she surprises everyone with a very composed yet captivating presence on screen. The heart of the film lies in the eyes of Tabu who makes the movie as deep as the depth of her eyes and as intensely beautiful as her voice. As we hear that Vishal Bhardwaj was not ready to make the film without Tabu, you will believe it once you have watched the film. There is no way you can expect anything short of the best from the dialogues and music, when Gulzar Saab and VB themselves are at helm and they ensure that you do not fall off track even for a moment. A cinematographer can hardly mess it up when you are shooting in paradise. After a brushstroke in Rockstar and a miniature art-piece in Lootera, we get to seethe full painting of Kashmir in Haider. There are enough funny spots in this dark tale of complex emotions,thanks to the fact that Salman Khan had long hair during the period the movie is set. The film has various undertones which were obviously part of the play as well. It would have required a director and screenwriter who is at the peak of his direction and writing skills to have made it happen. The dexterity with which Vishal Bhardwaj has been able to pull it off shows us why he is probably the best in the business in India. I feel, it requires at least another watching before one can completely absorb the enormity of the work that has been created. Salute Vishal 'Bard'waj. Go get Haidered because rarely do you get a chance to read literature on screen." 
" If AK has 'Gulaal', VB has 'Haider'... 10 on 10","Less cinematic & more theatrical!This movie seriously has too much! And too much of everything..The psychic-eccentric character of Haider in so many ways resembles Prithvi Bana (Gulaal) and has deeper connotation to the character's get-up & dialogs, some which can stay with us for long and make us get deeper into it every time we check it again!The '3 old men firing snipers' is the best western scene I've seen in Indian Cinema. Sergio Leone feel!The 'Bismil' sequence: Wow! What an achievement in theatrics in cinema! The best theatrical sequence since 'Jaane bhi do Yaaro' I would say! Much more than a song; it is a sequence that gets things out of control and sets the pace of the movie in the second half...'Aao Na Grave-digging' sequence is yet another beauty & I spurted out laughing crazily for some minutes! 'O Brother! Where Art Thou' feel!'Haider Stand-up Performance' is bloody good & gets metamorphic!Emotional turmoil handled in a spectacular way. The confrontation that the characters 'Haider', 'Arshia' & 'Ghazala' face is shown in an epic way The confrontation ignited by the dominant society for so-called larger good (haha)And what if this confrontation is prevalent everywhere in the society around you and there's a very thin line between being a 'friend of the society' or an 'enemy of the society'? Things get out of proportion and messy and sad and brutal and bloodyA brutal take on the Kashmir dilemma. I haven't experienced it in a better way...Super metaphorical mimicry on 'AFSPA' & 'Chutspa'Music that would just perfectly blend & leave deep impression!Power-packed performances make this movie an epitome of talent showcase I guess we get such output when the director doesn't compromise at all and expects nothing less than perfection in each aspect, in each sense And he eats, sleeps, drinks, thinks, trips just this movie for a very long time in life But however he does it, VB delivers something par excellence Has to be a super ambitious work!Mile stones in Hindi Cinema: 1. Gulaal & Haider 2. Maqbool 3. Gangs of Wasseypur and so on and so forthRight at the top for now! Wow!" 
" Haider..... It's a mother-son chemistry that storms the screen.","Shahid kapoor has hit the bull's eye this time with haider. The ease with which he unveils the character of Hamlet on screen needs an OUT- standing ovation. He has exploited all his talent in the movie and has left no stone unturned. The other eye catching character is the protagonist's mother and I guess no one could have dine it better than Tabu. She has been a brilliant actress and again proves her mettle here. Kay Kay menon and Irrfan Khan are as always superb. Shraddha kapoor is sweet but does not have much to do. Overall, to go or not to go is not a question at all. It's a must watch and undoubtedly the best movie of year 2014 till now." 
" A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Vishal Bhardwaj's final chapter in Shakespeare trilogy","Haider is the latest offering from the renowned Indian filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj. Co-written by Basharat Peer and Bhardwaj himself, Haider is the third and final chapter in Bhardwaj's Shakespeare trilogy. Having already made successful adaptations of Macbeth (Maqbool, 2003) and Othello (Omkara, 2006), Bhardwaj was left with the choice of adapting either King Lear or Hamlet to complete his trilogy. He opted for the latter because of the presence of a strong sexual undercurrent in the source material—a motif that harks back to the first two films of the trilogy. The uncanny choice of Kashmir of the 1990s—a treacherous avenue of unparalleled beauty and unfathomable danger where people just disappear, never to return again—as the movie's backdrop proves to be a stroke of pure genius as it helps Bhardwaj in orchestrating an enchanting mise-en-scène that elevates an otherwise sprawling orgy of histrionics to the realms of realism. By the mid-1990s, Kashmir had taken the form of a like a spewing volcano, a ticking time bomb ready to go kablooey at any given moment. The terrorist insurgency in the Kashmir valley had started to pose a serious threat to India's sovereignty and the army had to be given a carte blanche so as to guard the country against any possible threat from both within and as well as outside the country. The people of Kashmir started seeing the growing military activity in the region as a violation of their basic rights. The separatist leaders saw this as a golden opportunity to galvanize the masses against the state and started adding fuel to fire as the valley got encompassed in a miasma of mistrust. Although, the situation has improved significantly over the last decade, a lot of work still needs to be done before the conflict can be fully resolved. Bhardwaj's film also leaves a strong message not only for people of Kashmir but for all humanity that nothing can be gained through revenge and in the absence of trust.Adapting a work of Shakespeare is no kid's play. Even the most experienced campaigners can falter if their ambition gets the better of them. The key to adapting any major work of literature is to be wary of one's limitations. Haider is far from being called a perfect adaptation of Hamlet. But, Bhardwaj, to his credit, gets the job done. There are moments of sheer brilliance but there is also a lot of drivel which could have easily been chopped off. Haider has all the makings of an epic but it faces some serious pacing issues towards the second half. Also, the narrative appears to be sketchy at some places. But, that's the price that one must be willing to pay for one's ambition. One of the main themes of Hamlet is chaos. This chaos is most evident in the play's central character who, in many ways, is a personification of confusion and duality. His highly complex, fascinating albeit bizarre nature makes him a singular character in all literature, endowed with contradictory traits that fade the lines that separate virtue and vice, heroism and villainy, and sanity and madness. In Haider, Vishal Bharadwaj and Shahid Kapoor try their best to grapple with the endless contradictions that define Hamlet's multidimensional character. Oedipus complex is another major theme that runs through Hamlet. The term Oedipus complex denotes the subconscious emotions and ideas that focus upon a child's desire to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex. In Haider the syndrome is both latent and nuanced in comparison to the play.Haider not only serves as a decent adaptation of Hamlet, but it also proves to be a powerful socio-political commentary on Kashmir of the 1990s. Without the Kashmir angle, Haider would have appeared more empty and existential, with the Shakespearean characters merely playing their parts in a bid to reach the end of the trail. But, with Kashmir as its backdrop, it almost comes across as a propaganda films that aims to serve as a bitter reminder of our not too distant past. Haider is a warning of how easily the youngsters can be brainwashed and led astray by anti-national elements if the state machinery fails to look after them.While the acting is brilliant all around, it is Tabu who steals the show with a multilayered portrayal that would have guaranteed her an Oscar had Haider been a Hollywood production. Shahid Kapoor's performance in Haider is not perfect but is easily the best of his career, and it comes as no big surprise as Bhardwaj has a reputation to get the best out of his actors. Kay Kay Menon plays his detestable part with the desperation of a mangy scoundrel. Shraddha Kapoor serves well as an eye candy, but, beyond that, not much can be said of her acting. Irrfan Khan is brilliant as ever in the limited screen time that he gets. While the entire support cast does a reasonable job, Narendra Jha, who impresses in the role of Haider's father, deserves a special mention.Overall, Haider is a dark, distorted and diabolical work of cinematic art that falls well short of attaining perfection. At regular intervals, Bhardwaj tries to lighten up the mood perhaps to satisfy the cravings of the casual viewers. Needless to say, the movie is technically brilliant: cinematography, editing, and music are all at par with the international standards. The movie has several memorable sequences but the ones that stand out are: Shahid Kapoor's monologue, the sequence in which Haider brutally kills his captors, and the final graveyard sequence which may prove to be a real trendsetter as far as Hindi cinema is concerned. Haider is not meant for casual viewers for it will test their patience to the limit. As far as the intelligent viewers are concerned, the movie offers enough food for thought to keep them engaged. Highly recommended!For more, please visit, A Potpourri of Vestiges." 
" Hamlet splendidly weaved into the militancy and raw beauty of Kashmir","Macbeth, Othello, and now Hamlet. Vishal Bharadwaj does it once again, by re-imagining Shakespeare in a very gritty Indian milieu. This time it is the Kashmir of 1995 in throes of militancy.The instruments Vishal Bharadwaj used for Maqbool and Omkara, are far sharper this time around. The songs are very rustic, and completely of the type to be found in street plays (not even a symbolic nod to Bollywood or a titillation to the audiences with a Bidi). The sense of suspense even sharper (even with a story with a basis as well known as Hamlet). The characters continue to be just as eccentric as in Omkara. And death once again continues to be not an infrequent visitor just like with Omkara. Yet the context is more sombre. And the whole scenario of militancy IMO dealt with quite responsibly with (what I would imagine to be) a good sense of reality.Not everything is wonderful. On the acting front, Tabu is impressive but understated. Shahid Kapur does well by his standards, but every so often I used to wonder how much better Pankaj Kapur would've done in some of the scenes. Shraddha Kapoor manages the role of pretty innocence well enough, but will probably cringe when she watches her own histrionics. Kay Kay Menon, and Irfan Khan of course are a pleasure to watch, but this is not their best film. While the songs aim to dramatise, I found them underwhelming and unnecessarily melodramatic in this context, Also the film is just a tad too long and could've been shortened by 15-20 minutes.Be prepared to see a Kashmir which does not look the swiss alps but still deserves to be considered amongst the most beautiful places on earth. This kashmir is a little raw. And forms the milieu for two concurrent threads, one the intra family drama which is the very essence of Hamlet, and the general environment of militancy and counter insurgency. Moreover the plot moves at a fairly measured pace and manages to retain the interest and fascination. It might surprise you (after my earlier paragraph), but these are the reasons why I would classify the movie to be a must watch.Yeah, go watch this, this is not to be missed, any complaints you might've notwithstanding." 
" Haider.","The movie Haider, as most of you would be aware of is an adaptation of Shakespeaes' Hamlet. It does help if you have read the original work ,but believe me there is nothing in the movie which you cannot understand if you have not read it.In fact if you have not read it till now,its better because the story would be anew to you. Set in Kashmir it takes the essence of problems faced in Kashmir valley due to insurgency and counterinsurgency measures though it doesn't focus on the problem alone. In a broad sense this movie is about search of a father by a son and subsequent events which leads him nearer towards revenge. First of all the movie is not everybody's cup of tea. You've to be very patient throughout to get the real pleasure out of it. The film is slow paced so as to draw you into it, just like an old wine. And, like an old wine you are supposed to sip it and not drink it in a hurry. The ensemble actor list is itself worth mentioning from Shahid ,Shradhha,Kulbhushan Kharbanda to the talented KK Menon,Tabu and of course the ever reliable Irfan Khan. Their performance is indeed flawless in the movie.The relationships are well portrayed ,the agony and trauma well expressed and the hate ,betrayal ,action scenes well-choreographed and scripted(especially the action sequence in the last scene). The only fault I could find in the acting department is that because of the presence of so many good actors (though the movie has good runtime still) much is left to be desired especially from Irrfan Khan whose performance is too succinct for an actor of his caliber. As said earlier, the movie is slow paced but the script doesn't fail the plot often. There is hardly anytime where you find yourself napping in the movie. Songs are good especially Arjit Singhs voice again creates magic with 'khul kabhi'.Cinematography, background score(which sometimes sound like Bourne trilogy) are also good. Accent training for the actors could have been better as anyone who has visited Kashmir for even a short duration would find only the two Salmaans accent to be genuine. But then it is a minor fault in a movie a cut above rest. If you are patient and could immerse yourself in the plot ,then the movie holds a lot of promise for you. But wont recommend to those who could not find tickets for another movie or those who want to have party time without application of brain.It is certainly not the best work you will ever see, but certainly a cut above rest, deserving a watch." 
" One of the best adaptations of Hamlet","Of the trilogy of films by Bhardwaj based on Shakespeare's work, Haider is probably the best one. The backdrop of 1990s Kashmir gives the film an unique look and feel. All the actors in the film have performed well. Most of the characters have grey shades but the actors have balanced the act. It appears as if the actors realized that they were working in a special film. Background score is brilliant; while most of the songs, unlike the regular Bollywood offerings, add value to the film and appear to be a part of the narrative. Can't find any major faults with this film. Of the Bollywood films that I have seen so far this year, Haider is the best bet for India's entry to Oscars. IMO, the film has created a new segment in Bollywood films. Bollywood films such as these can be enjoyed by global audiences as well much like many of the films from Europe, Latin America and South Korea." 
" A really good movie with brilliant performance by all the star cast...!!!","My rating:- 8 on 10=>What's Good:-1. Brilliant Cinematography2. Brilliant performances by all the star cast3. Special credits to Irfan Khan, Tabu, Shahid Kapoor and Kay Kay4. Songs went well with the situations...special credit to Bismil song.5. The movie has its on charm taking you into a different world6. The dark Kashmir of 90's =>What's Bad:-1.Very few scenes where your mind may be diverted or you may feel bored....but can be ignored easily as hardly one or two scenes for couple of minutes each.=>Final Words:- "A very well directed movie with brilliant performances by all the star cast.....its a different genre movie,not for the masses....if any one is looking for a masala or typical Bollywood movie its no fun for them to watch.....as this one is slow which builds on the go and has its own charm and class"." 
" Haider: a masterful re-imagining of Shakespeare's Hamlet","Haider is not merely a remake of Hamlet. Vishal Bhardwaj has taken the source material, re-shaped it to meet the Indian context, and has made the story his own, while at the same time remaining faithful to the original. The story starts with Haider (Shahid Kapoor) returning to his home in insurgency-ridden Kashmir, after his father Hilaal Meer has been taken away by the army for treating an injured militant. Hilaal is a doctor, an idealist who believes in "being on the side of life, not of ideology". By the time Haider returns to his homeland, his father has joined the ranks of the "disappeared" and the home of his childhood has been destroyed. Worst of all, Haider's mother Ghazala (played by a luminous Tabu) seems to be drowning her sorrow in the arms of her brother-in-law Khurram (Kay Kay Menon). Haider joins the ranks of those Kashmiris desperately searching for their loved ones who have disappeared - seeking his father in hospitals and morgues, turning over blood-drenched bodies in a truck, a sheaf of photocopied photos of his father in his backpack. His childhood sweetheart (Shraddha Kapoor) tries her best to be supportive, but is unable to break through his wall of depression. His depression spirals into rage when he is contacted by a mysterious Roohdaar (Irrfan Khan) who confirms that his father has been killed because of the machinations of Khurram and Ghazala, and that his father's wish was for Haider to avenge his death. From then on, the movie descends into the depths of Haider's thirst for vengeance. The choices he makes, and the consequences of those choices drive the rest of the movie to its inevitable conclusion.Shahid Kapoor plays Haider in the role of a lifetime. His talent, generally obscured by his pretty-boy looks, is in full force here. His eyes mirror his vulnerability and despair, his rage and brutality and eventually his madness. The movie belongs to him. Tabu is Ghazala, glorious as ever. Described as half-widow, half- bride, she does a wonderful job of conveying forbidden obsession and desperation. Her relationship with her son, with their unexplainable passion for each other, is delicately portrayed. Kay Kay Menon is, as always, wonderful as the clownish and somewhat pathetic Khurram, gradually revealing his true face. Irrfan Khan is impressive in his small role as Roohdaar. Vishal Bhardwaj has succeeded in capturing the desolate beauty of Kashmir, once described as "heaven on earth". The snow takes on a character of its own, and as Haider spirals into madness and destruction, the snow-filled roads and woods seem more threatening than beautiful. The movie effectively captures the struggle of an entire people, trapped by misplaced patriotism and opposing ideologies. Not an action movie, watch it to see poetry translated to the big screen." 
" More than Perfect","Haider is one of my most awaiting movie of the year. As a Huge fan of Shahid Kapoor, I must say this is the best work done by him in his hole career. Tabu is natural in her role. The supporting cast Kay KayMenon is good. Shraddha looks sweet and cute.The relationship between Tabu and Shahid was far beyond than Imagination. Their Chemistry rocks and binds the viewers by their Performances. The story, screenplay, and dialogues are very good. Songs are superb. The track Bismil becomes too good with Shahid Dance and Expression. The Psychotic role in second half rocks. The guest appearance by Irfan Khan is superb. The back ground score is good.All in All I say this Movie is must watch. Ten on Ten" 
" One Very Good Watch","KUDOS !!!! Certainly how Hamlet is put into a Bollywood movie. Vishal deserves a pat on his back. Haider, it reveals a story based on Kashmir's life. If one has taste for real movies then this movie is worth watchable. Balance of Grudge and tragedy is beautifying Kashmir very well. Raw beauty of Kashmir will make you want to visit the place. Shahid, Tabu, Shraddha and Irfan have played well for their roles. Side characters in the movie will entertain you. Movie deserves time to draw your mind into it. One needs patience to see and understand the story. Message it contains at the end is to be peaceful. Such sensible movies are rare to see. Thumbs up for Haider, Shahid's fans will get to know why he'd go bald for a movie.Don't miss a valuable movie for your time !!!!!!!!!!" 
" Must see cinematic masterpiece!","This is a must see movie. In my college days, I've read Hamlet with great interest and written essays on it in which I had put a lot of creative effort. So now to see how brilliantly the director and the actors have portrayed Hamlet in an Indian context was truly a marvelous cinematic experience. This is a must see movie! Everyone's acting was great, but I particularly liked Shahid Kapoor, Tabu and Kay Kay Menon's acting. The seen where Shahid Kapoor acts like a mad man in town corner with a plastic radio around his neck - is the best. Also loved the ending - it's in line with Hamlet's original theme but with an interesting twist." 
" must watch","This is not a simple adaptation, this takes not a simplistic stance; Haider is a remarkable achievement and one of the most powerful political films we've ever made, a bonafide masterpiece that throbs with intensity and purpose.The result is a knockout, a film that makes you smell corpses, that makes you shudder with melancholia, and a film that points accusing fingers. A film that doesn't flinch. Is Haider Vishal Bhardwaj's best film? Vishal Bharadwaj brings alive the ecstasy, pain and passion of Hamlet on screen, he also reminds us of the harsh truth in our own backyard, the man-made mayhem in the God-made jannat that is Kashmir. All this done with his classic poetic touch intact. The second half dips a bit before it picks up again with an unforgettable climax. Please watch this film" 
" A real acting and direction for cinema lovers","Haider on of the finest movie after a long run, a must watch for all true cinema lovers and an exceptional acting by Shahid Kapoor,showing his true potential and acting skills,though some of his past releases were not favorable but this time he nailed it and showed what he is capable of.And as for now,till date this would be the movie for which he will be remembered of.And a real appreciation for Vishal Bhardwaj for an outstanding exceptional direction for which he has never been doubted about.And not to forget Tabu,Kay Kay Menon and Irfan Khan for their specific characters,after watching the movie cant even imagine who else would have been a better option. What are you waiting for,go to ticket counter,grab a ticket and enjoy a master piece !!"
