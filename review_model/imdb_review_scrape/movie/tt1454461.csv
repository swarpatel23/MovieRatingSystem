" terrible acting by bobby and nana","i had great expectations when they copied this from a telugu movie which is a superhit.If only bobby and nana acted the way they should be (as in the original movie), it could have been a hit. They tried their own stunts and the movie is a big flop.Its better to watch the original telugu version even if you can't understand the language. Then one can realise why telugu version is superhit while this Hindi version is a super flop.The only plus point is sriya with a hour glass figure. She was looking better than the actress from the telugu version.i wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are extremely bored and nothing else to do." 
" Average Actioner","I was quite looking forward to this and ignored the reviews because I like my 'masale' bollywood movies from time to time and it did have Nana in it. However, I was slightly disappointed to find nothing new story wise which I'm sure has similarities to Bobby Deol's Badal. Nothing quite stands out in the film so it's understandable why it wasn't a hit. Positivies were Nana Patekar who even though needed more screen time in his limited role still managed to nearly save the film with his unique and funny womaniser character and the actress, who I saw for the first time was simply stunning. Now I have found out Shriya Saran is big in the south but hopefully she'll get to test her acting skills with more Hindi commercial films. Overall, decent performances all round making it good timepass giving is slightly better than 5 - 6/10" 
" Worth a watch once","Ek the power of one is a film that can be watched once for fun.Remake of Athadu,this film does not have the same punch and thrill as that,but nevertheless it is tolerable. The film is about a hardcore hit-man who goes on the run from the police after being misunderstood as the killer of a politician in Mumbai,lands up with a mistaken identity in an aristocratic family in Punjab,and how he deals with a CBI cop who is hot on his trails,and tries to prove his innocence in the killing Music is fully Rock-guitar lovers will like it. Bobby and Nana do a good job,but perhaps it is not a role entirely suited for Bobby. There's some degree of overacting among the ladies. Comedy is unremarkable. Watch it for timepass."
