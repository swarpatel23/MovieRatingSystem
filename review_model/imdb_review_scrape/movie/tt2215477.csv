" Mesmerising cinematography and good acting","I watched this film with mixed expectations. On one hand, I had seen the Nagada Sang Dhol and Lahu Muhn Lag Gaya clips on you-tube - exactly what caught my eye and made me want to watch it. On the other hand, a- not-so-good rating and most reviewers claiming it was very bad were lowering my expectations. I did, however, watch it, and I loved it. The film is intense, wonderfully directed and benefits from great acting. I am not familiar with any of the actors; nor with Bollywood films in general, which I do not find appealing because of their over- dramatisation of... pretty much everything. And mostly, poor acting. This is where Ram-Leela stands out. Apart for a few scenes, the director made use of the actor's skills, and pushed them to the point they save the sometimes-poor script. There's great chemistry in there, as well as some more than convincing acting, all in wonderful colours and costumes. I had a hard time understanding why it's got such harsh reviews, given how good it is, but reading them I realized what the problem is (and probably why I liked it): Ram-Leela is not a film for puritans. While it seemed quite tame to me, certain watchers found it "vulgar", or too sexual. From my point of view, it's aligned with European films. What it lacks in plot-line (although decent), makes up with daring performances and honest acting. As for those claiming it's not a love story, I agree: it's a battle of egos, and most important, a battle with the self for each of the characters. This could have been emphasized more, but you can't have everything." 
" Breathtaking visuals but abrupt emotions with unnecessary violence","Director Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali ,is known for taking the scenes far more ahead from screenplay by adding visual magic and he succeeds to create the magic again. He is also master of portraying emotions but this movie lacks his masterstroke. Story is simple, screenplay is OK but dialogues by Siddharth-Garima , are very good mostly. Movie is slow at places even belonging to the action drama romantic genre. Climax is forced because of adaptation. Love scenes are best as usual. Director has given his 200% to conceiving the visuals that he couldn't give his 100% to the emotions. Characters are not well established. A women, who is able to remove bullet from her most loved one person's dead body, possess soft heart!! How!? A person goes to the deadly enemy's house without proper disguise or any other precautions. Even , he can intrude with the help of a tree trunk.Guns are the most common things between them but in pre climax they fight with swords! Main male lead body is deliberately over exposed, which doesn't go well with the premise of the movie, where rest of the person prefers to cover themselves. Performance wise Ranveer Singh is OK but lacks in most of the emotional scenes. Deepika Padukone is adorable. He slaves you to look at herself in every frame. Ratna Pathak is impressive. Richa Chaddha is fine. Music by director himself is OK but lyrics by Siddharth-Garima is very good." 
" Goliyo Ki rasleela... Ramleela- It's all body no soul","Disappointing is the word with which I would like to start this review. When you know it's Romeo and Juliet, when you have seen Isaq and Isaqzaade you don't expect any thing exceptional from another movie with more or less the concept,plot and story. But when you see the name of Sanjay Leela Bhansali somewhere in your mind you feel may be this could be something different. At least the chemistry between the lead will be worth watching.And that's where, for me,the movie fails miserably. Chemistry is not just about the physical intimacy, it can be felt even when the leads are not sharing the same vicinity, like in the "Lunchbox". May be I was expecting love but there was only lust with lame dialogs. The couple seem to be desperate to get laid and hardly want to know each other. Apart from that there is unnecessary violence. There is nothing in the story which can keep you engage towards the screen. Enough of visuals, arts, huge sets and beautiful lass from SLB, its high time to incorporate story, original screenplay in your movie agenda. Even the visuals and set reminds you of some of his work done in the past. Please take some risk, get something new like you did in Khamoshi rather than being of the safe side with gimmicks, item number and cheap dialogs. The cinema is changing and its changing for good! Hope you be a part of that change soon." 
" Thoroughly disappointed to say the least.","what a pathetic portrayal of an age old story. the movie rides on Deepika Padukone's skin show with excessive use of colour which could irritate one to the core.There is nothing in the movie which could keep the viewer hooked. Abhimanyu singh's talent is totally wasted, wish he had got more screen time. I personally like movies with violence, but Raam-leela is full of mindless, stupid violence. Must say that violence is not Bhansalis cup of tea.When everything was seen falling apart, there came the final nail in the coffin, Priyankas awful item number. Ranveer is okay, after all the hype much more was expected from him. The only saving grace of the film is Supriya Pathak who pulls off a difficult character with panache." 
" Bhansali's another self-obsessed film, which is visually stunning with few notable performances but how many times I am supposed to watch the same story again & again.","To begin with RAM-LEELA remains another self-obsessed, colourful but over-stuffed painting on the celluloid with some exceptional brush strokes failing to generate any huge impact on the viewer in totality. The film does have its worth watching moments which are mostly to be found in its first half watching the lead pair together doing their lusty sexual acts (questionably) portrayed as Eternal LOVE. But post intermission it all fizzles out drastically and the director tries to add too many unconvincing twists and turns taking it to an unnerving end sadly. No doubt few magical moments do come in at various intervals, consolidating the director's famous status in the industry. But regrettably they are not something fresh or path-breaking, since either they remind you of a song sequence of his mega hit "Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam" or of a powerful scene of "Devdas" giving you a seen before kind of feel, repeatedly. The soundtrack too is able to impress only partially with a few good tracks in the initial reels and as the film progresses their excessive use starts becoming annoying, particularly in the second half.To say the truth, being a powerful love story as per its theme, I found the famous "Bhansali Feel of Love" also missing in the film replaced by lust, sex and double meaning dialogues quite surprisingly. For instance, I may sound to be an 'old timer' but I don't think a girl can easily come forward and give a straight smooch to a boy if he looks good and of her own type just in the first meeting itself in a public place. Moreover the way both the boy and girl start rolling over each other on the bed with several kisses one after another in their second meeting only, for me it wasn't anything close to 'Pure Love' but only lust, sex or body hunger and nothing else.Interestingly such depiction of love was not there in any of Bhansali's earlier films. The director never showed his love birds in this kind of sexy, lusty avatars ever before. Hence undoubtedly this time Bhansali is more interested in reaching the masses with cheap insertions of a blue film parlour, David Dhawan like rhyming dialogues, guns, bullets, murders, rape attempts and bloodbath, may be in a state of desperation. Yes, he begins well with an exceptional sequence of rivalry between two groups in the first scene and then handles another sequence depicting the same with a superb camera-work & vision. But actually this isn't a Bhansali genre at all and once the love birds get separated, going into the violent mood, the film falls flat with everyone behaving in a confusing manner not suiting their actual character as defined in the first hour.In the performance section, the actors simply surrender themselves to the vision of their director and the three winners coming out of entire cast are Deepika, Supriya Pathak, and Richa Chadda unarguably. Following the above are Abhimanyu Singh, Gulshan Devaiah, Sharad Kelkarand Barkha Bisht who play their parts well but the director should have given more mileage to Richa Chadda alone. Along with these good performances there are some pretty ordinary ones too including Raza Murad, Homi Wadia and the deliberately added poor item number of Priyanka Chopra. Talking about the lead pair, Deepika once again scores over her hero and she even goes shockingly bold this time as instructed by the so called love-guru i.e. SLB. Ranveer on the other hand, doesn't offer something new, as he plays the same old flirty lover boy with the only difference of his Rajasthani attire and nothing else through a great script too with something novel to share.Revealing the controversy, SLB's film has nothing to do with either Lord Ram or his sacred Leela at all. So the director had a clear intention of using the phrase "RAM-LEELA" for his film's instant publicity alone and all this controversy could have been easily avoided by using any other name with a regional touch. Regarding its subject based on Shakespeare's "Romeo-Juliet", I remember watching QAYAMAT SE QAYAMAT TAK when I was in school and then few other films too with the same theme. Plus just recently there was not one but two films made on the same subject namely ISHAQZAADE & ISSAQ, which forces me to think that perhaps except Vishal Bhardwaj, very few have read the other classics of William Shakespeare in reality in our own Bollywood. And that might be the reason why they repeatedly pick the same old, over-used Romeo-Juliet again & again to bore the innocent audience quite arrogantly. However there is one more reason which comes to my mind regarding the use of this same theme again and that is the 'Fear of Rejection'. Anyway, for me CINEMA means "The Art of Storytelling" and if a film hasn't got a new or interestingly fresh story to tell then it is quite a waste of time despite all the great visuals, drama, music, performances and execution. To elaborate on the same, we have a small life here to live on this planet with a limited capability to read or know all the worth studying literature of the world. So we need the medium of cinema to introduce us to many unknown and unexplored gems written within as well as out of the country following a wider vision. And that is exactly what I search for while watching every new film coming my way in any form.So with a hope that these reputed film-makers of our industry would soon find their old courage back, I can only recommend RAM-LEELA to the viewers who are more interested in just the bodies and not their souls." 
" an amazing performance by ranveer singh and deepika padukone","i don't get it why people are criticizing so much about this movie.... okay if its about the sultry dialogues i agree they were somewhat vulgar. but to be honest the movie had the elements of romance, chemistry and emotions. the cinematography was great and i loved the colors in the movie.... deepika padukone has become a fine actress and every film of hers depict her smooth acting abilities. ranveer singh is the coolest actor I've ever seen on the screen. the songs are nice and the choreography is outstanding. i couldn't take my eyes off deepika during the song "nagada sang dhol". it's a good movie to watch but surely is not a family movie." 
" Fierce, Effective, Tapping yet Erratic is what Ram Leela is all about.","Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, one of the most anticipated movies of the year releases with all its bang and reveals itself as least related to stuff for which it had been declared controversial.Sanjay Leela Bhansali's take on Romeo-Juliet, despite a known script, seems quite refreshing. The visuals, nobody questions, is by far Bhansali's best. Utterly flawless. You might want to compare the flawed VFX effects of movies like Krrish 3 and Ra. One and find Ram-Leela's visuals standing far ahead of them. The symmetry he puts in, the pattern he develops in every visual is like the best artist would.SLB's poetry, dialogs and expression are so well that you might want other directors to get training from him. The professionalism is of Hollywood standard.The songs are already chart-topping (Nagade Sang Dhol was No.1 on i Tunes for 7 consequent weeks), and when you watch them in the movie you feel mesmerized. So well choreographed are these dances that you couldn't stop yourself from thinking of performing them on some occasion. Though a bit raunchy, Ishkiyaon Dhishkyon seems more funny than vulgar. Priyanka's item number gives mph effect.The strongest part of Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela is the star performances. We do not doubt that Deepika Padukone, who has established herself as an equal of the Vidya Balan and Shaban Azmi only betters herself with this movie, giving her critics a yet bigger challenge. She, as Leela, is flawless. You wouldn't be watching Deepika Padukone, but Leela in the movie. Though in Cocktail, Ye Jawaani ha Deewani and Chennai Express, Deepika was the soul of the movie, here she has to share it with Ranveer Singh who acts equally well. This is his best performance so far. In fact, this is the best performance of the year by a male actor. Richa Chada is shockingly real as Leela's sister-in-law and Supriya Pathak, though sounds a bit like Hansa, is exhilarating and fear-inducing. Every dialog she delivers is pitch perfect.The perfection that Bhansali has expressed in all the aforementioned topics gets polluted by the flawed script. Though in the first half you do not notice how time passes with the songs, acting and the chemistry setting fire to the screen, the second half takes a U-turn. The second half begins with impracticality, which moves on to deal with various serious topics, which is exceptional to a love story. What becomes a problem here is the absence of effective execution of these scenes. The sub-plots are in abundance but all last for so less time that the tears of Leela and Ram do not reflect on the audience's eyes. Before the audience could feel the pain, the scene changes. The ending becomes more like a fairy tale which ruins all the realistic happenings of the movie.Despite its flaw, Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela stands as WORTH WATCHING. One must definitely watch this class-and-mass movie for entertainment, visuals, star performances, songs, and by far the best adaptation of Romeo and Juliet by Bollywood. Go fall in love with Ram-Leela!" 
" Over the top movie making at its best. SLB disappoints.","In spite of the not-so-appealing formula music and over the top cinematography, the controversy clad 'Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ramleela' was one of the most anticipated movies this year, courtesy SLB. The opening scene has multiple common men shooting bullets and throwing glass bottles with close precision and accuracy. The grand entry of the hero himself, taking a selfie on a motor bike would have been mesmerizing had it been the 1980s. The overly tanned and oiled up body of Mr. Singh and the dhoti tied up as low as humanly possible attracts the attention of very many local women in the movie and a few watching it. Deepika is stunning as Leela, though. But the essence of the subtle yet intense romance of the great work by Shakespeare is completely lost in this very Indian rendition of the same. Mr Bhansali has reduced it to what we as an audience want, colourful dance numbers, extreme drama and a sexual reference in every other scene. Music is no charm either. With irrelevant songs at irrelevant junctions in the film, the audience is bound to get restless. There was a point in the first half when we became desperate for the intermission, it came some 20 minutes later. The second half is no better. With stretchy sequences, pure masala bollywood dialogues, more useless songs, pointless silhouettes and closeups and typical SLB elements at every step, the movie comes to a close. Supriya Pathak's, Richa Chadda's, and Barkha Bisht's performances are the only high for the movie. All in all the movie makes us feel used and violated. The makers of the film try to cash in on their name, legacy and the Indian viewers' mentality and give us a piece of cinema decorated with warm colours and excessive drama. The sad part is they will succeed in their propaganda with critics like Taran Adarsh and Mina Iyer eulogizing every frame. Sad." 
" Trigger Dabane Ki Baat Mar Kar, Trigger Daba Daal","The film starts on Bhansali sets where there are lot of guns. A riot occurs between two groups of people in bhansali sets. Meanwhile Ranveer is introduced by Tattad Tattad song on another Bhansali sets. He has the facial look of Bhansali himself but the lower body is shaved like Salman of 90s. May be Bhansali always had a fetish for that kind of appearance. Then Supriya Pathak who is member of one of the groups is introduced on yet another Bhansali sets. She continues her Khichdi act from where she had left. In next scene, it is revealed that Ranvir is a porn film seller. and just after that the Slutty Savitri Deepika is introduced, this is not a co-incidence..and yes, on yet another Bhansali set. She plays a Gujju but has accent of a vernacular Marathi.Its Holi so a song starts and Deepika has started doing what she did in BKB, LAK, Cockail, KCK, Yjhd, Lafangey Parindey, i.e. hititng on the hero in the first mulaqat. They are about to have sex too with the underlying idea that "Mor Apne Pankh Kholte Hain, Hum Kapde Kholte Hain". But as we know by now, having watched those Deepika films, she never gives the "happy ending". So not much happens except that at least this time she didn't shy from kissing without shitting in her panties unlike BAH and YJHD. Ecstatic and erect, Ranveer falls in a pond of water created in Bhansali's sets.Then in the next set and scene, they are talking to each other rhyming words with the standards that can compete with the lyrics of Friday by Rebecca Black. Then there's the cheesiest of all dialogues – Deepika "Jigar Pe Mat Ja, Trigger Daba Doongi". Ranveer says "Daba Na". She replies "Chee". Jab Chee Hi Bolna Tha to Trigger Dabane Ki Baat Kari Hi Kyun? Trigger Dabana Hai To Daba Daal Warna Uski Baat Mat Kar. Either be complete slutty or complete Savitri. But then its Deepika Padukone. From here on this is Ishaqzaade Part 2 in Bhansali's sets. Ishqiya Dhishkiyaon song choreography reminds of Govinda-Karishma c-graders. The Police raid scene where police guy exchanges porn DVD with bullets is WTF. Ranveer kills Deepika's brother but lust wins over family bonding and now Deepika is desperate to marry Ranver otherwise "Dono Ek Hi Kamre Mein Kaise Reh Sakte Hain". Then after some more Ishaqzaade in Bhansali sets which can be fast forwarded if you are on torrent there is an Indra the Tiger type OTT sword fight scene of Ranveer. Then some more fast forward reveals that the end scene is also same as Ishaqzaade." 
" Great entertainment with great art,music,acting,direction....","Great movie with great adoption of Romeo-Juliet .. Some people are saying it's boring I don't know but it's totally entertainment and no scene useless or boring... Each set are very well made and songs are beautiful along with dance steps.... Direction is too good the way bhansali depicted culture of Gujarat's community is beyond imagination.. Being Gujarati I know this culture so hats off, chemistry between Dipika and ranveer it's amazing ..acting is too good. Only thing is language is pretty harsh but that to require for script like this so I am pleased bhansali use right one liners and it's way less vulgar(not even single scene I found uncomfortable) murder,jism2 etc,,, if people in India make chennai express,krish 3 and dubang ( don't want to put znmd,yjhd and 3 idiots),a super hit than why this kind of movie who depict true culture are not making money because all people need is b**lshit crap movie they don't respect art... And that's why we are not getting Oscar or any critique award... Because there is no money involve in making this kind of movie... If people don't make this movie 20 million rs grossing film than no offense but people in India don't have test of art....In sort must watch movie with some uncomfortable language( not to watch with family).. All I can say is bhai bhai.." 
" Pure brilliance from Bhansali.. go and watch it now","One of the finest movies to come from Indian cinema this year... Sanjay leela bhansali hits all the right notes again after hum dil de chuke sanam, black and devdas. Strong performances, perfect direction n a beautiful world created by bhansali. In short, a mesmerizing experience. Ramleela is one of the most magical love stories i have seen in years... i found ramleela an extremely well portrayed love story and massively entertaining. Its a visual magic and truly spectacular. Picture perfect frames, huge colourful sets, beautiful heavy costumes, emotions, poetic lines and melodrama. Deepika and Ranvir set fire to the screen together and as individuals. Do not be surprised if deepika bags in all best actress rewards this year and Ranvir emerges as a huge star in Bollywood." 
" Excellent adaptation of the classic Romeo and Juliet Story!","I adamantly disagree with the other reviews on this site, this movie isn't like other Bollywood movies, just like the Baz Luhrmann version of Romeo and Juliet strayed from the norm of Hollywood movies. It pushes the boundaries of story telling and what can be shown on Indian movie screens, and the methods with which you can show fierce hatred between two families and love that can bloom even with huge conflicts surrounding it.This leads me onto where Sanjay Leela Bhansali got some of his inspiration from and in my opinion he has intertwined a very religious time of the year in Indian culture excellently with the intricate and fierce story of Romeo and Juliet. He has also still managed to maintain a modern twist whilst still retaining the religious and cultural past times of India.I feel that the majority of reviews are from people who don't appreciate the story of Romeo and Juliet and the different adaptations in the past that have lead to what will now be referred to as the Indian version of said classic story. Please take some time and watch the original Shakespeare version and the Baz Luhrmann version as these will give you a good representation of an excellent story and telling the story in a different and unusual way.I loved the chemistry between Deepika and Ranvir and they're now one of my favourite on screen couples, that said the majority of the acting in this movie was very convincing with the mother of Leela being a particularly fearsome character.All in all, don't try and compare this to other Bollywood movies, it's most definitely in a different league. It mixes playful flirting, fierce love, hatred, revenge, bitterness, contempt and finally sorrow and remorse into a moving screenplay that truly had me begging for the film to not finish as the classic story of Romeo and Juliet does." 
" Do not waste your time ... unless you watch it just for the sets, not story","Do not waste your time ... unless you watch it just for the sets, not story. The only reason to watch this movie would be for the sets and cinematography - Sanja Leela Bhansali is known for this. Story is horrible and it appears different parts of the story were written by different people. Story is an insult to one's intelligence.They have tried to cast the story as modern day Romeo and Juliet, but no way can that comparison hold. Romeo and Juliet was a class apart.I wish I had seen Captain Philips instead." 
" Ram! Ram! save me","I will not talk about the plot for there is none to be talked about - we all are already well-familiar with the age-old story. But I do have to say that the movie also failed in the departments I had expected it to fare better. The over-dose of colors and lavish sets gave me a headache. In fact, it felt that those colors had a character of their own - as if they, not the humans, were the protagonists of the movie, for the human protagonists have been so poorly acted (rather they have been so over- acted) that the colors are anyway a better asset for this movie. Talking of performances, the single-most positive thing about this movie is Supriya Pathak's performance. I have always known Deepika to be someone who cannot act and this movie just confirms that belief, but her co-star in the movie was no better either - both of them provided a commendable show of their anatomical assets to the respective target audiences. Their so-called and highly publicized chemistry, I found to be non-existent. They appeared like two kids playing banal jokes on each other - err... perhaps that these jokes involved revolvers makes them adult. And Ms. Chopra was of course not going to be left behind - she might have succeeded in titillating the rikshaw-wala audience by dancing with an unbuttoned dress.Talking of revolvers, this movie is nowhere near to reality; not that I expected much, knowing that it is Bhansali's movie, but a realistic modern twist to Shakespeare's play could have been somewhat likable. I will not talk of direction, etc. for the risk of sounding pretentious, because one can only direct when one has good material to begin with. The last thing I will talk about is verbal vulgarity. The dialogues in the movie are not romantic; they are horny and outright vulgar. If this was required to support the movie storyline, it would have been another matter. But the plot of the movie does not at all require any such vulgarity. It appears to be just a strategy to titillate the masses, like most other things in the movie. This is the kind of trash Bollywood makes and then people in India wonder why India has such huge number of rape cases. Shame on Bhansali!" 
" An Exceptional Piece of Art","Im very disappointed by the audience for their taste is getting worse each day. I wonder what different they want. What was new in Ye Jawani Hai Deewani? What was new in Krish 3 and whats going to be new in Dhoom 3? The only difference is that Ram Leela is made from the colors of imagination and fantasy and not just that the fantasy is painted as it is on the canvas of a film. All other movies are just the copy of Hollywood worst movies in a worst manner. There are three things that make Ram Leela and exceptional one. First the music. Sir Sanjey hats off to you for not only a superb director but a wonderful music maker. Though I'm a Pakistani but i really appreciate the fact that this movie has utilized the real Indian instruments with songs which sings the soul of India. Second the sets. No movie in Hollywood or Bollywood could make such beautiful dreamy sets just so beautiful. Third the acting of Ranveer and Depika. The way Depika showed emotions in Rang Laga De were just too beautiful and emotional. The music and acting made it the most beautiful song ever. Similarily Ranveer showed so many mixed emotions beautifully. Well i will say our audience are losing their taste. They are not into the classic movies like Ram Leela, Lootera or Sanwariya. They deserve Krish 3 and Rowdy Rathore. Keep it up SLB. Every movie of yours is Superb." 
" Mindless, colorful movie without a strong storyline","When a new movie releases we often look at the rating provided by other reviewers and decide on watching the same. But sadly the 5 star or 7.2 star rating provided to this movie may be based on the directors previous works and not the current one! Ram Leela is a good misdirection done by Mr. Sanjay Leela Bansali. Even Houdini would have to bow to him if this movie turns out to be a hit. Having watched many variations of the classic Romeo and Juliet, the last being one with Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes, I can very well say that Ram Leela is clearly not a variant of this. Most likely the reviewer has been primed to think so. With an absolutely no story line, the movie relies on raunchy scenes between Deepika and Ranvir to carry the show. There's mindless violence, ridiculous camera work used for portraying mayhem against women, cheap dialogue's to show coolness. To take your attention off the plot, Mr. Bansali uses these misdirections very well. The eyes see colorful Gujarati Garbha dances, a clear desert, some good architecture around Gujarat, and the mind forgets that the movie has a story to tell! An item song by Priyanka Chopra is also thrown in to save the day. The rating 3 of watchable is mainly to see our Hansaben, Supriya Pathak. Her portrayal of Baa is mind blowing and dialogue delivery is great. Those used to seeing regular Baa's in our TV serials, now get to see a different Baa! Deepika had made a good choice with Chennai Express, where her acting skills were utilized. In Ram Leela she's there to dance and whine! One does not see the boldness Aish portrayed in HDDCS or the damsel deeply in love Aish portrayed in Devdas. I guess Mr Bansali wanted to see a mixture of both in Deepika. But sadly the story line does not call for it! Ranvir still has remnant parts of Band Baaja Baraat and Ladies Vs. Ricky Behl. In most of the scenes either he is full carefree or full sentimental (literally crying). A talent like Richa Chadda is wasted. To conclude, its sad to see Mr Bansali following Ram Gopal Verma's footsteps wherein camera work and raunchy scenes are used as misdirection for a bad storyline"
