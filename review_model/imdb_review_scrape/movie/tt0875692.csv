" A twisted thriller, not particularly convincing but still watchable","Well my summary says it all. Aggar is quite enjoyable despite its flaws (and there are quite a few). It's a thriller which has its moments of suspense and high drama, but it is generally quite poorly written and directed, lacking depth and credibility. Something is missing there - it could be with the general story, which is not very genuine, it could be with the poor dialogues which were hardly believable, and maybe it's the direction which is weak and created a feel of unbalance. Anant Mahadevan is the one who directed some dreadful movies like Aksar so my expectations were very low and I was even prepared to hate the movie. But there's one reason why I actually think it is slightly better than his other movies: I actually managed to go through the entire thing right until the end, something I did not think I'd be able to do. So maybe there was something about it that did work after all. Where acting goes, no one shines but no one hams it up either. Tusshar Kapoor does pretty well in some portions like in the scenes in which he romances Jhanvi, but overall this role was too complex for him and he did falter from time to time, although he tried to do his best. Shreya Talpade was okay. Udita Goswami looks awfully attractive and too hot to resist, so for me she was the bright spot of this film. Her acting may not be particularly impressive, but she has a good screen presence. All said and done, Aggar is not to be taken seriously. As a thriller it's not completely there, though as said, it has its moments. It is overall an okay film which can be watched with friends, but remember not to expect too much." 
" All is not what it seems...","we've seen this kind of story before but somehow with Aggar you keep waiting for what is going to happen next. It was well paced but nothing out of the ordinary.Udita Goswami plays a married woman who gets involved with her husband's(played by Shreyas Talpade) psychiatric patient (played by Tushar Kapoor) when she suspects that her husband has been unfaithful to her. Upon Aryan's (Kapoor) release for a psychiatric ward, he is unknowingly hired as a scheduler for Jhanvi Merchant's(Goswami) company when he bumps into her personal assistant Reetu (played by Nauheed Cyrusi) at a coffee shop. By the way, Aryan had become a psychiatric case upon the accidental death of his unfaithful girlfriend Nisha (played by Sophiya Chaudhary) but that's a whole different story which happens at the beginning of the film. The plot twist occurs upon Aryan's release from the hospital when he meets and falls in love with Jhanvi behind the unsuspecting Dr. Aditya Merchant's (Talpade) back. But is Dr. Merchant really this naive as to be so clueless to what is going on in his immediate surroundings? Overall, the film is okay. It was entertaining and the music was good but there was something lacking. The dialogue was quite poor (for example, I thought is was so suspicious that Dr. Merchant would call his wife "Biwi" as opposed to her first name but as the movie carries on you will understand why that particular dialogue was written that way and it's still inexcusable). We've seen both Talpade & Kapoor in better performances and even the normally electric Goswami seems wasted in her role. I would recommend this film to those who are just looking to pass the time. C-" 
" don't bother....","I don't understand how other reviewers rate this as high as they do. The story is mediocre to say the least, the dialogs horrible and acting flat. I couldn't even bring myself to sit through the entire film.The story, to sum it up, is about a man who is sentenced to a sanitarium as a result of his quarrel with his girlfriend on a building going really awry. Enter the doctor (who likes to be god in his patient's eyes) who seeks to cure him in his own unique way. But all is not well as it seems with the doctor and his personal life. Paths intertwine and complications arise as the movie drags on rather expectedly. Don't let my summary fool you into thinking it is any good. If it's thrillers you seek, look elsewhere."
