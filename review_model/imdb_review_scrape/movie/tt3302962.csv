" A great take on life after marriage..something rare in bollywood..","I was really looking forward for this film , as after a long time it looked like a sensible movie was coming out of Bollywood..and I was not disappointed , as the movie turned out exactly how I expected to be , funny and realistic at the same time..It may not be the most unconventional movie churned out , but still something worth watching If you're a fan of sitcoms nonetheless.. Farhan was just brilliant as the confused husband cum dad , while Vidya was perfect as the typical wife cum mum..both of them complemented each other wonderfully , which is one of the main reason the movie worked big time..The only bad thing about the movie is it was too damn long , which shouldn't be for this kind of film , as some unnecessary scenes and songs could have been avoided..there comes a point in the 2nd half where you start wondering what is actually going on , but the movie picks up right before the climax..So nothing much to say here I guess , if you love sensible cinema , you'll really enjoy the movie , but If you are into mindless masala movies , I suggest you ignore this one.." 
" Side effect from watching this movie- Confusion","The start is promising. Later its all confusing and then its ends with a big WTF... A struggling musician marries a well settled working woman. An ingredients for a serious movie. Instead it looks like dish supposed to a Biryani...turns out to be a Khichdi. How the hell did this struggling musician afford to go to exotic foreign locations with his girlfriend and also propose her with a big solitaire while in a hot air balloon? The wife's profession is not known. They lead a luxurious lifestyle. They even hire a 15000 Rupees nanny while the wife is not working. Though, through out the film its about the male leads struggle. Defies logic. The support acts were like playing kabaddi...they come and go at the drop of a popcorn. The main issues portrayed are genuine but the story really lags in dealing with them. Not to waste money on this. If you really want to watch this, wait for it come on a movie channel." 
" A quirky yet relatable take on marriage; worth the moolah","I don't understand the fuss surrounding the movie, considering how it's probably one of the better scripts and execution of comedy I've seen in Bollywood in recent times. I had watched this is a fully booked theater and from the roars of laughter and clapping, I can assure you that 'Shaadi Ke Side Effects' is worth at least a one time watch.Farhan and Vidya play a married couple (Sid and Trisha) who complement each other and are a breath of fresh air. (Definitely a break from seeing much older actors romancing heroines who could very much be their daughters.) The "unconventional" pairing plays out lovely on screen and needless to say, both actors nailed their respective roles with such conviction. Farhan's comic timing and delivery of witty dialogue has again ascertain his strength as an actor (amongst his ever growing list!) and Vidya's subtle portrayal of a urban woman struggling to be a new mother is remarkable.Saket Chaudhary's hilarious take on parenthood and painful truth of life after marriage is well-balanced with all-too-familiar scenarios of both "the good" and "the bad". While this uni-sided film is written in a male's perspective, we do get to see Trisha's woes as a wife/mother, too.The second half of the movie seems a tad draggy with some unnecessary parts but the film manages to pick up its pace at the climax. The twist is certainly unexpected and gets you wondering how the movie is set to end. (I actually did like the ingenious ending, too.)It's possible that audiences who didn't quite like the movie had much higher expectations of Farhan and Vidya for they are actors who have done quite "serious" films in the past. However, do keep in mind that 'Shaadi Ke Side Effects' is a light-hearted comedy that invariably takes you on a quirky ride while occasionally tapping on the seriousness of marriage. I'd recommend this relatable film to anyone who's in the mood for some laughs!" 
" A missed opportunity... could have been much better","The movie, being a sequel to directors fresh and delightful Pyaar Ke Side Effects, starts on a high note. The jokes are good and you have some really smart dialogs and funny situations as the first half progresses. Especially the part where Farhan tries to feel like a pregnant lady. However that's where the good things end.Second half is a Mish-Mash of emotions and multiple characters which are totally wasted. Taking nothing away from Farhan or Vidya's acting, it's the director's confusion about what he wants to show that is the culprit. The love a father may have for his child has been totally ignored with Farhan's character treating his daughter as nothing more than a hassle as there is no father-child connect in the movie. Characters like Vidya's mother and Vir Das are underutilized. Even Ila Arun's character has been mis-handled.The movie tries to show the issues a couple with kid with single income may face, yet we never see Farhan working hard while whining about expenses all the time (While living in a luxury house by Mumbai standards). The movie completely loses its plot and the climax leaves a bad taste as a half baked attempt.I would still say it deserves a one time watch for the first half which comes as a tasty appetizer, its the main course that got burnt." 
" Second Half Fails In Comparison Of The First Half","SHAADI KE SIDE EFFECT - A movie based of marriage life,,,,with Vidya Balan and Farhaan Akhtar in it,,,,so we are safe in acting department that there will not be any complain with it,,,,,rest depends on story which is good,,,,screenplay which is good too but stretched,,,,dialogues are awesome,,,,songs are entertaining except one........ Is everything is fine,,,,,! no,,,,,,its the editing department who haven't done its job correctly....... When will they understand that when u are making a comedy movie that too based on marriage it should not be longer then 2 hrs and 10 mins......But no they have made 2 hrs and 31 mins long movie,,,,and its too difficult to make audience laugh for such a long period....... Honestly we have a brilliantly made first half,,,,there are so many comic scenes in the movie that i cant tell u one by one......Yes but the humour is high in some scenes,,,,and will be difficult to understand by single screen audience...... Sid and Trisha are living a perfect marriage life until they got a daughter in their life,,,,this is where some problems starts in there life ,,, sid first tried to solve them but after some time he started to run from them..... Thanks to director that movie is not shown in a 'CHALTE CHALTE' manner,,,,then it would have been more boring,,,,rather the fighting scenes are too full of humour ....... Up to interval the movie is top notch,,,,2.25 out of 2.5,,,,m cutting .25 just for the song Tumse pyaar ho gaya,,,,which doesn't fits the situation and break the situation...... But its the second half which drags u down....... U cant say that the second half is bad,,,,its just that it fails to u entertain in comparison of the first half,,,,because it has some melodramatic scenes and less humour...... So 1.25 out of 2.5...... As i said there wouldn't be any complaint with acting department,,,,Farhaan akhtar is the best actor in Bollywood industry who can easily do characters who can deliver humour dialogues with superb comic timing,,,,,remember him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,,,,.......He has done a great job.... In case of Vidya Balan ,, it seems like she has repeated the role what she have done in Ghanchakkar,,,,and she has done a great job too.... Rest of the star cast is mainly wasted in very small roles ,,,, although they all have done great job specially Vir Das...... About songs ,,,, the movie starts with Desi Romance,,,,and u wouldn't get any problem with a song in the opening sequence,,,,that's really a smart move,,,,rest of the songs are according to the situation except Tumse Pyaar Ho Gya which i mentioned earlier.... Editing was bad,,,,some melodrama should have been edited,,,,the comedy should have been there in the movie till the end,,,,and the climax too was bad....... So 3.5 out of 5 ,,,, u wouldn't regret it watching on big screen By ANuP APu KuMaR" 
" Wonderful performances and some crackling dialogs, made this worth a watch.","Wonderful performances and some crackling dialogs, made this worth a watch.Marriage is a beautiful alliance if the couple understand each other. It will be a nightmare, if they fail to do so. But more or less, it's an alliance filled of compromises and lies at times. Lies can be said to keep the spouse happy too. But at what cost, is a terrible question. The consequences are mostly dreadful at times even practically. This movie is about an alliance of Love and Lies. Farhan Akhtar is man with tons of talent and his acting talent and his coming come use in a great deal in this film. Vidya Balan has been one of the finest actress in recent years and she plays her role as a wife and mother wonderfully. Between the two, their chemistry is great, and they seem to slide well into their roles. Aa script about a typical after marriage life, having baby, and trying to run away from responsibilities, learning from mistakes and forgiving each other would have been nonsensical if it did not have some great dialogs, which should make the stereotypes as fun but not as caricatures. that's what precisely happened in this well written script by Saket Chaudhary. From being together and have fun in early years of marriage, to changing anatomy through pregnancy, while the man becomes more responsible towards the family, and even earns more for them. This is all a clichéd tale that every family goes through. The parent teacher meetings, the birthday parties of the kid's friends, they are all part and parcel of life. Now, those are made interesting by some good writing and fine acting. Together, the team has done a wonderful job in taking the script to a respectable level. The execution through cinematography is wonderful too. Though, editing seems to have disappointed in second half by dragging on some very dramatic moments, which would have been better chopped off. To Farhan and Vidya alone, this film is worth. Also there are wonderful performances by others including Vir Das and Ram Kapoor among many others.A 3/5 would be apt in a film that's hilarious right through the first half, and a kind of drama in the second half. Yet, its fun all through." 
" Wonderful film for married couples!","Yet the film's consistently crackling dialogue and terrific performances from its leads makes it enjoyable despite its obvious bumps.But Shaadi Ke Side Effects belongs to Farhan, who reveals incredible comic timing as he slips into the role of the self-obsessed man-child struggling to cope with change. Steering clear of melodrama even when the script falls prey to it, Farhan plays it effortlessly cool. The film then is easy and breezy, although too long at nearly two-and-a-half hours. I'm going with three out of five for Shaadi Ke Side Effects. Predictable and occasionally misguided, but also hopelessly fun. SHAADI KE SIDE/EFFECTS is more about rediscovering your partner, post marriage. The fact that Saket borrows from real-life instances makes it relatable and identifiable. The connect is tremendous, with the spectator often drawing parallels with his/her life. On the whole, SHAADI KE SIDE/EFFECTS is a delicious take on contemporary relationships. This one's relatable, heart-warming, amusing and thoroughly enjoyable!" 
" An utterly confused, less entertaining and one sided take on the after effects of having a child rather than a marriage.","After a long gap of 8 years, post his fairly likable PYAAR KE SIDE/EFFECTS in 2006, director Saket Chaudhary makes a comeback with SHAADI KE SIDE/EFFECTS exactly like an eight year long affair gets converted into a marriage after a prolonged thinking and decision making. Now interestingly I am not sure that whether this should be considered as a praise or as a negative comment about the film. But Saket's new product is quite similar to the confused mindset of the present generation which is really finding tough to understand this traditional concept of marriage in the right perspective. And that is the reason why we are having so many broken marriages, divorces, splits and live in relationships widely happening in our society, particularly since the last decade.So making it clear in the beginning itself, yes SHAADI KE SIDE EFFECTS has its good, intelligent & entertaining moments mostly visible in its first half. But the film cannot be presented as any positive take on the 'institution of marriage' at all due to a pretty weird, puzzled and silly story progression in its final hour which simply ruins the entire fine build up in a highly casual or careless manner.Besides, it is to be understood that 'getting married' and 'having a child' are two different steps of a newly formed relationship between a couple, which obviously have their own individual value, significance and timings. But since Saket's film gives only 10-15 minutes to the married couple and more than 135 moments to their life after having a child, therefore it should ideally be called "BACCHA HONE KE SIDE EFFECTS" rather than "SHAADI KE SIDE EFFECTS" to be clear. So in reality this is not a film about the first few years of a newlywed couple (which certainly have a completely different meaning for the two) but a film about their changing relationship after having their first child to be precise.Thankfully, SKSE begins on an interesting, fresh note focusing on how the couple is managing to keep the love flame burning in their first (one or two) years of a married life. And therefore does have that novelty and amusing humour too coming at regular intervals with few songs in its initial reels. Also, the moment it all starts becoming monotonous, the director plays a very intelligent twist with Ram Kapoor (just before the intermission) and you get assured that this surely is a smart take on the issue handled well.But unfortunately everything crashes down with some deliberately added, over length subplots in the second half just like a honeymoon ending after the first 5-6 months of a marriage getting back to the real tough repetitive life as usual. The dramatic scenes result in loss of grip and the over stretched climax leads to boredom. However, most importantly it's the confusing culmination of the script which simply pulls the film down drastically and you are just not able to make what the director wished to say with all this crazy mess representing nothing.In short, if you are expecting it to be an entertaining and enlightening take on the concept of new-age marriage then you are seriously mistaken. Because the film is simply not made with any such clear mindset and it will leave you even more confused than before after the end credits start rolling. Though, the director tries many tricks to keep the smiles coming in the post interval sequences. But in the process shatters all the high expectations raised by its intelligent first half and you get nothing exceptional in the next hour right till the end.Having said that the film does have some superlative performances by the lead couple, as well as the supporting cast providing you something to watch constantly. Farhan once again proves his amazing versatility and so does Vidya playing the enthusiastic mother (though I am still amazed how they said yes to such unconvincing script). The role fits like 'T' to both the talented stars and I seriously wish the writers had given them something more sensible and sane to do on the screen honestly. Ram Kapoor is excellent as the friendly guide and Ila Arun shows her under- rated skill of a great performer yet again. Vir Das tries hard to be funny but Rati Agnihotri, Purab Kohli and Gautami Kapoor are just there for only a few scenes.The soundtrack has some peppy tracks used well. Plus both cinematography and background score are fine as per the limited requirements of the concept. So strictly being a multiplex film, it might get noticed by the youngsters thinking about their own marriage and their first child in particular. But at the same time they are also going to find the entertainment factor largely missing and the film not giving any enlightening message on this serious subject, performing below the expectation.In strong words, till you are dealing with love, affair and friendship, everything is fine and can be taken in the lighter sense. But once you venture into the 'serious theme of marriage' then you got to treat it responsibly and just cannot play with it in a casual mode with the sole motive of delivering a hit at the box office, walking on a disrespectful or unbalanced path.And since SHAADI KE SIDE EFFECTS does the same in an utterly confused, unsure and irresponsible manner so I am not able to give it any higher ratings taking it as an interesting yet baffling, silly take on 'marriage'." 
" Enough entertainment for a suggestion","A family person may need some space for self even after marriage, but how far can (s)he really go looking for it makes the subject.The movie starts with a confident young married guy who seems to know how to keep his married life happy, But he panics soon as he becomes a father and tries to adjust himself to his new 'family'.The movie does exaggerate some aspects for the sake of humor.For an example, the ordeals of fathers in a supposed kids play. And the side effects that the title mentions were mostly one sided. But the director did try to make amends in this aspect with a hint at the end of the movie.All the characters were carefully drafted and meticulously used." 
" awesome movie!","Shaadi Ke Side Effects Review (By Me); most marriage movies don't go into dept of what goes on beside closed doors, but Shaadi Ke Side Effects does. when you put actors like Farhan Akhtar & Vidaya Balan on screen together it's just makes the whole film even better. As they portray their roles as husband and wife it was nailed! SKSE shows you the fun & serious parts of marriage, which everyone should know exists. marriage is about having fun and loving each other but what happens when your not ready for more responsibility like a baby or another car?? what if all you wanna do is have fun with the marriage?? SKSE takes you there and shows your the outcome of what marriages are like with lies and betrayal. FA & VB have done such an excellent job of making the audience understand that there is such a thing a love forgiveness & understanding. the funny moments of the film will make you laugh like crazy and the serious parts will have you think either is that how I feel or am u ready for marriage? Awesome movie altogether ." 
" The one movie NO ONE should go through...","Yes, I walked out. Think about the top 5 movies you have hated... and wished you never watched them... I have seen them all and never walked out. I'm sure if you were to watch this you would put this on top of your list and it will remain there forever... brainless, tasteless, filled with silly stereotypes. Let's put it this way... the only reason I even registered a new IMDb account is only to write this about the movie. Not for one second in the movie will you feel comfortable or even funny. I can't believe Farhan took this up... I don't care who rates this as even 1 star I totally think its unworthy of even that. So much drama can't happen in one's life especially within 2 hours of us watching their lives. Every scene from every movie in Indian cinema where a husband and wife would have fought for what all reasons has been put into this one movie. How a child brings total chaos to their awesome lives... how they have to mold their lives for the child even the BAI (house help) gets SO much footage. Truly the worst movie I ave ever seen." 
" Effective side-effects of shaadi!","It took more than 7 years for 'pyar' to culminate into 'shaadi' for director Saket Chaudhary! His suave Sid and crazy Trisha (same character names as in the prequel 'Pyar ke side effects') finally get a reality check into the practical world of ' & they happily lived ever after'. Let's check all side-effects of this flick one-by-one: Plot: SKSE narrates the mundane yet pragmatic nuances of married life through the eyes of its male protagonist making the movie a fun riot for guys (with wife-jokes and mother-in-law jibes). However, this one won't disappoint ladies either as it does have its moments of sensitivity, emotions, tenderness and utter feminism. The movie well depicts the scuffle and issues that emerge into life of 2 people when they graduate from being 'couple' to 'parents'. Vidya's dialogue to Farhan – "We're pregnant" says it all! While the first half is smooth and refreshing (tickling your funny bone on regular basis), it loses a little grip in the middle but ends with a tinge of emotional (yet predictable) maturity enunciating 'strategy' for happy marriage. Cast: Farhan being the narrator, is the backbone of SKSE and literally wears Sid's soul on his sleeves! In all avatars, emotional/ fun, bachelor/ father, he excels and manages to convey with ease dilemmas of unprepared fatherhood along with his strife to strike a balance between the husband and father in him. Vidya, as per some people, is a misfit as she looks bloated throughout the movie. But then, who would have so easily portrayed the vulnerable yet suave yet wild Trisha who has just entered motherhood. I would rather say, her unshapely shape actually suited the demands of the character. The skin show could have been averted but then Vidya manages to carry it all with élan. Real-life couple Ram and Gautami Kapoor are endearing with Ram getting a good screen-space. He doesn't disappoint. Real-life VJs Purab Kohli and Vir Das manage to add funkiness through their respective characters. It was good to see Ila Arun after a long time while Rati Agnihotri fails to impress. Music: Opening number, Indo-western 'Desi romance' is my pick from the album while title track rocks with its Punjabi touch and funny lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Jazzy B's 'Harry is not a Brahamchari' is becoming a rage among boys. 'I am sorry tumse pyar ho gaya' reminds of 'Kya karun' from 'Wake up Sid'. Pritam won't stop drawing inspirations! In all music and background score well-suit the mood and pace of movie. Flaws: Despite superb acting by its actors, SKSE does have its share of flaws, major one being, extremity in certain situations reducing authenticity! Being narrated by male protagonist, it is quite skewed in favour of 'Adam' gender relegating the 'Eve' stereotyped. Also, the self-professed dual-life portion of Sid is a bit exaggerated.Despite these flaws, SKSE is a refreshing urbane rom-com dealing with relevant issues of modern-day couples. Go watch it with your friends for some good laugh or your spouse to rewind some memories! This shaadi ka laddoo is worth tasting at least once! " 
" Two great actors make great film.","Beautiful movie! A bit different Rom-com, but still well depicted. It was really good to see the two talented actors of B-town sharing screen. Besides, people really appreciate Farhan and Vidya and that is what will attract people towards the movie. The might not have a rocking opening because the songs are something which didn't attract the people to some extend. According to the predictions, the flow and speed of the box office collection of 'Shaadi key side effects' will be same as that of 'Hasee to Phasee'. The movie is worth watching. Since 'Shaadi key side effects' has been quite awaited film, no doubt it will dilute the box office collections of 'Highway' which might be very threatening for Highway as it has earned only 20 crores in its first week which exactly half of its budget. The competition between 'Higway' and 'Shaadi Key side effects' will undoubtedly be very biased." 
" Terrible for Bollywood","Pyaar ke Side Effects was a funny-ish enough movie. How bad could this one be?My uncle always says that once a movie starts with a musical number, it is pretty much downhill from there. This movie is yet another example this theory of his being true. We follow the life and times of a young and married couple to do a lot of things in order to keep their passion alive. Their fun-filled life is interrupted when Vidya Balan gets preggers. They then have to maneuver for years dealing with the incoming child, changes in behaviour, problems in marital life amongst very many things. There are several things that they use as coping mechanisms, lying to each other about their whereabouts, living in hotels, getting a nanny, living in a flatshare, pretending to be carrying someone else's baby, to name a few. I realise that as a teenager I am too young to be able to relate to the more than half the things covered in the movie but I have also seen movies about olympic heroes, prostitutes and prisoners, and that seemed to go down well. I wanna say that Farhan Akhtar does a good job of portraying an immature guy who is clearly unable to handle married life, just based off the fact that the urge to punch in his face grew every 10 minutes. Vidya Balan on the other hand, was just plain disappointing. She should really stop riding on the wave created thanks to Parineeta. Her terrible acting coupled with badly written dialogues and a supreme lack of chemistry between the actors does not bode well for the audience. Why Farhan, why must you sully the good name that you have managed to bring to your family? There was a song that was filmed in Australia, which was completely unnecessary to the story, unless of course you count being able to write off a trip to down under. I do believe that the director was trying to send subliminal messages through the movie with the excessive use of the color blue and you know, the whole marriage on the rocks thing. Subtlety is truly an art form, isn't it?Oh, I'm sorry, I was just made aware that this movie was meant to be a comedy! That just changes my perspective on this movie, especially with the use of toilet humor. Not.This movie apparently proves that the only side effect of marriage is a child. And being the only child of two working parents, this fact doesn't throw me into an existentialist crisis at all. There were several similarities between this movie and Jennifer Lopez's favorite mistake 'What to expect when you're expecting' along with MTV's '16 and pregnant'. There was a lot of voice-over in this movie, which I believe was a influence from producer Ekta Kapoor. This was also the reason there were several bits of the movie where you feel like you are watching an extremely long and grating soap opera.The Good: There was excellent product placement that was cleverly woven into the dialogues. Ex- Baskin Robbins, T-series, Polo from Volkswagen The Bad: Just because you use the image of Donald Duck and call him Mr. Duck, it does not make you safe from legal issues." 
" "Let's Cook Up Some Side/Effects, Shall We?" ♦ 33%","That is what the writers asked themselves before the film went on floor. I mean, they should be awarded for fabricating such a make- believe story of which not one sequence looks credible. Saket Chaudhary seemed eager to make a sequel after his Pyaar Ke Side/Effects being an unexpected, sleeper hit as the two lead characters were quirky, original and the plot actually made sense.Vidya Balan & Farhan Akhtar are good idiosyncratically, but they are not wacky, yet ordinary people. As a result, an ordinary story breaks out which everyone experiences in their lives. In other words, the film does not show anything new that we already already don't know, the kinda- humorous jokes notwithstanding. Starting off with the couple's fancy idea of spicing their marriage up, they immediately jump into parenthood. Then, they show how an infant can break havoc in the love life. So, I feel personally, that this film should be renamed "Parenthood Ke Side-Effects!" Because marriage only stays on-screen for a minute or two. In fact, the first sequence is so ironic to the whole idea. That sequence seemed like there ARE no side/effects.Scenes that contain humor are totally co-incidental or situational and they turned me off rather than tickling my bone. It was like fillers that we see in some cultural events which are both boring and time- consuming. Next, predictability kicks in and we are shown how selfish people can become, that is, after getting stricken with these so-called side/effects. Unwanted character (Purab) comes and goes after making a silly point (Makers should understand, we won;t believe when you show someone jumping from a 19th floor's balcony to 18th floor). Ram Kapoor's character is the only one who is believable, but then again, it was cliché. Towards the end, the characters self-realize how they are not loving themselves and letting the kid come in between. The climax is supposed to be emotional, but since the genre is comedy, it ends with the most disastrous scene in cinema history. A very poor closure.In other words, this film lacks elements that can carry a story further. Basically, it coheres itself with parts that are exaggerated. This is not at all how married couple behave when they invite a baby to their lives. It gives a wrong idea to newly married people and is a poorly made solution of utter hyperbole. To prove what? A point, maybe? Nope. To mock the whole institution.Vir Das is one good player in here and although his participation was unnecessary, the writers make us believe that he was important because it is he who maneuvers the situation for Farhan's character. Songs are blown-off party smashers and there is nothing much to consider, as far as celluloid is concerned. It was even worse that the seriousness is lost in an attempt to create humor.BOTTOM LINE: Akhtar & Balan will save the day for people (like me) who are obsessed with the theme. But I assure you, this is a very silly film. Not sticking to facts and actuality, it is a piece of exaggeration coupled with sheer imagination.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" Shaadi Ke Side/Effects : Shaadi ka Superhit formula","Sequel to the rom-com Pyaar Ke Side Effects, Saket Chaudhary's second directorial venture 'Shaadi Ke Side Effects'(SKSE) is an affirmation to the 7-year itch syndrome even if we consider the chronological gaps between the two releases. With a tone that resonates the likes of celebrated film-makers like Basu Bhattacharya or Basu Chatterjee, Saket probes into a subject that has a perpetual potency - Marriage and its associated trappings. He retains his protagonists - Sid(Farhan Akhtar) and Trisha(Vidya Balan) who are happy as a couple but experience a change in the conjugal dynamics until 'they' become pregnant. It's a change that all husbands would easily identify with (No ! I am not a MCP)and perhaps that's the reason why the story is told from Sid's perspective, but with enough humor and lough-out-loud moments.With an upcoming additional responsibility, comes a baggage of financial woes, marital woes and more importantly a craving for 'individual space'. He resorts to his shrewd brother-in-law(Ram Kapoor) for advices, who gives him some eternal gyan to lead a 'dual' life thereby keeping your married life happy and secured. While the first half is vibrant, quirky and credible, SKSE suffers from the curse of the second half. The plot gets heavily overstretched and clumsy and meanders into zigzag directions.Fundamentally at the heart of SKSE, there is confrontation. Sid confronts with his alter-ego , who is a youthful, carefree chap devoid of any responsibilities and lives life on his own terms. Saket projects those manifestations in some of the standout scenes, particularly one where Sid has a verbal duel with Trisha on the daily chores related to their daughter. He succeeds in exposing the dilemmas and tribulations that the couple is going through beneath the comic veneer.Cinematically unadventurous, it is confined to the same apartment shots with glossy vignettes that would appeal to multiplex audience except for one song sequence serenading with Australia travelopedia.It also succumbs to some routine brand plug-ins like SKORE, Royal Enfield etc.Pritam's music has variety this time which hits the crest with the dance floor numbers like Harry's not a Brahmachari and Desi Romance.Both Farhan and Vidya live their characters , bringing out the most subtle nuances with effervescence and delightful panache.Without losing their individuality, they make their on screen chemistry sizzle. Vidya exudes uninhibited sexiness but certainly needs a weight check. Yet, its Farhan who gives the necessary emotional depth to his confused and frustrated Sid and walks away with all accolades.The supporting cast gets ample elbow space but is marred with some ill-sketched characterizations. While Ram Kapoor shines as Farhan's brother-in-law cum marriage-guru ,the characters of Ila Arun,Purab and Vir Das appear contrived.As they say there is no fool-proof plan for a successful marriage, SKSE consummates in a rather convenient way which is a departure from the existential reality. It's like a chewing gum , you will only enjoy till the sweetness lasts. Rating : 2.5/5"
