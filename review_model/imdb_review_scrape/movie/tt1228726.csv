" A Good Entertainer.","I had just watched a few promos for this movie before watching and therefore quite surprised at the content of it as well as the genre  comedy.Three women, looking cool, high jack a truck which carries some diamonds and in the process they kill the guards and the members of the police escort. In the meantime, Gopi arrives in Goa, from a far away village in search for Kishen so that he can take him back tot village and have a plot that he has been handed over by his dead father. But Kishen, being a conman, swindles people with help from his accomplice, Babu and also lies to his girlfriend and insists that its his twin brother who does the swindling all time.The movie, directed by Deepak Shivdasani, stars Sunil Shetty, Arshad Wasi, Sandhiya Mridul, Anishka Khosla, Mahima Mehta, Atul Kale, Vrajesh Hirjee and Rashmi Nigam.and Ashish Vidyarthi.This is an outright comedy which is worth watching  an entertainer. What makes it more interesting is the way in which Deepak Shivdesani, brings all the characters together, which evolves around a set diamonds.Conclusion: An interesting, good entertainer worth watching with family as well." 
" Fast paced nonsense for enterainment !","One circus of a film, from start to end. Meant to be a comedy and there are a few funny scenes, but it's all mostly noise and nonsense.A villager from Hashimpur lands up in Goa, searching for a guy who is supposed to inherit some property back home, and this guy is a small time conman involved in many cases here in the city. Soon the two meet but are caught up ion a mess involving diamond robbery, gangsters and police, and the rest is about how they get through it all.There is not much of meaning in the film. Everything especially in the first 3/4th, moved too fast and noisily, and does not even make sense. Most songs and dances are dumb and uninteresting. Arshad Warsi is by far the best actor in this flick, followed by Sunil Shetty. They have done their parts well.Don't think it's worth a watch really."
