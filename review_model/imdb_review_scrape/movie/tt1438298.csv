" An excellent movie, after a long time! Sanjay Leela bhansali has come back to form!","GUZAARISH Once again, and after a long time according to my standards, we got an opportunity to be amongst the first few to have watched the first public screening of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's newest venture, GUZAARISH. And two hours later, when I came out of the theatre with a lump in the throat, I couldn't but marvel at this outstanding creation on celluloid. Co-produced by UTV along with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, this clearly is Bhansali's best directorial effort till date. The theme is novel, at least in the Indian film scene and beautifully portrays a wide range of emotions. Love and caring; frustration and angst; helplessness and joy; anger and exhilaration are all presented with such finesse and perfection that it is difficult, well, nigh impossible to visualize as to how these emotions could have been better depicted on the screen. The other primary reason for the movie's powerful impact is that the ensembles of actors deliver their finest performances. Hritik Roshan, excels in his role of the magician performer turned quadriplegic and his eyes speak tomes of his inner feelings. Aishwarya Rai reveals that she can act, and wonderfully well, provided the script calls for it and if she has an able director to direct her efforts. The rest of the cast including the versatile Shernaz Patel, the debutante Aditya Roy Kapoor, the theatre personality Vijay Crishna (who is an Executive Director in one of the Godrej companies) and the graceful Nafisa Ali put in stellar performances. I will be most surprised if the cast members do not pick up more than a handful of awards. The music is also by Bhansali and while the few songs may not be chart busters, the background score is operatic in its expanse and adds to the mood of the various scenes. The dialogues are pithy and meaningful and couched in them are a number of philosophical statements. Bhansali's skill lies in making these not sound like drab monologues. I was reminded of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee directed and Amitabh-Rajesh Khanna starrer Anand whenever there were pathos tainted expressions of philosophy being mouthed on the screen. And just like it happened to me when I first saw Anand about three decades back, I was moved to tears in a few scenes; tears of a kind which do not cause uncontrollable sobbing, but which moisten one's eyes and leave you with a feeling of restrained, and quietly dignified expressions which speak louder than a thousand words. Bhansali's treatment of Euthanasia is without any melodrama whatsoever and this heightens the impact. Even the last scene is reminiscent of another Hrishikesh Mukerjee film: MILI; you know what is to follow, but still are left with the faint trickle of wishful optimism. Bhansali has proved that he can recover and recover well from his earlier blue themed disaster Saawariya, although the abundance of blue hues in a few scenes leave us with no doubt about the director's favourite color. Aishwarya looks stunning as well, and although her low cut dress is not what I have seen any nurse wearing, perhaps Bhansali intended it so as to provide some relief to the bed-chained hero! Ram Gopal Verma, who apparently has commented about his not liking her washing Hritik's hair needs to be reminded that Aishwarya looks more sensuous than all his pouting and pelvic thrusting heroines! Although GUZAARISH in the movie refers to the hero's deep desire to be freed from his state, it could also convey the GUZAARISH of every sick person to be nursed by a person like Aishwarya!!" 
" A Nutshell Review: Guzaarish","Hrithik Roshan didn't have much luck at the box office with Kites earlier this year (curiously some attested to Kites containing a lot of English which turned the local Indian audiences off, but this film also featured a fair bit of dialogue in the English language), but I still reckon that he's an actor of his generation to look out for. Ethan Mascarenhas is perhaps his most challenging role to date, as we know Hrithik for his physicality and his gracefulness in dance, but his obvious character condition here limits the former as we see how slight his frame is, clearly allowing his built to be slimmed down to portray the role more convincingly as a man whose muscles are wasted through inaction and atrophy. As for the prerequisite dances, the film allowed some moments in flashbacks where he shows off some graceful moves as a magician with a class act in presentation and packaging his brand of magic, further cementing Hrithik's reputation as one of the heroes of Bollywood who can actually dance.But what he aced in his role is how he convincingly portrays his immobility, relying very much on his facial expressions to bring across a wide spectrum of emotions. There's an added air of eccentricity and mood swings as expected of a man who gets handed lemons by Fate, so what best than to try and make lemonade from the situation, sharpening his wits in the process, since quick fire repertoire is something he can do, other times the scenarios constantly remind him how helpless he is without his caretaker by his side, and Hrithik shows this vulnerable side of him best. Not only that, Hrithik Roshan too lends his vocals to What a Wonderful World, which will probably delight his legion of fans.Aishwarya Rai Bachchan also has Guzaarish to thank in bringing out her best performance for this year, peppered by films such as Raavan, Endhiran and Action Replayy. While Endhiran was essentially Superstar Rajnikanth's starrer and didn't really challenge Aishwarya with the role she had to play, Raavan and Action Replayy were roles that were pushing those boundaries but the box office responses didn't quite match to expectations. I'll put my hand up to say she's back at her best as Sofia De Souza, the nurse who makes tremendous sacrifices in order to ease the suffering of Ethan, who got taken aback by his decision that will of course mean an end to her services and that notion of being emotionally slighted. There's always a touch of tenderness in her care of her patient, and that romantic tension constantly underneath.Sofia De Souza is typically prim and proper, and has a rather curious, lush wardrobe for a nurse - a point brought up later on by the public prosecutor Vipin Patel (Rajit Kapoor), though Aishwarya provided that tell tale spunk in Sofia with her (also much talked about) experiment with the cigarette, and the letting of her hair down in the song number Udi, sung by Sunidhi Chauhan and Shaul Hada, which stands out as one of my favourites in the film for that unmistakable Spanish influence. Joining her in the film is fellow Action Replayy alumni and Bollywood rookie Aditya Roy Kapoor (lucky him, to have made two debut films side by side with Aishwarya) whose Omar Siddique aspires to be Ethan's protégé, and goes to great lengths to being accepted and inevitably becoming a part of the extended family, which includes Ethan's mom Isabel (Nafisa Ali) and Dr Nayak (Suhei Seth).But the real hero of the production, has got to be writer director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who has bounced back from what many thought was a disappointment with Saawariya (which I begged to differ), weaving such a beautiful, sensitive tale without relying on melodrama or sensationalizing its main topic of Euthanasia. Flashbacks are used to effectively tell of Ethan's entire backstory leading up to and including a cringe inducing accident scene, and the pacing well done with the non-intrusive use of musical numbers to add to the narrative, without feeling forced. Bhansali has a keen eye to exploit the beautiful sets and through wonderful framing, light and shadow play, elevated Guzaarish into a film that's aesthetically pleasing to the eye.As the adage goes, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than to seek permission, and the main crux of the plot deals with Ethan and friends trying to push through the legal system to allow him to die at his own will. If there's a blip in the film it will be the treatment of the courtroom scenes, which was necessary to allow Ethan outside the confines of his physical prison, but addressed issues more so on the surface and rarely scratched the content deep down. It piques your interest to evaluate circumstances if you were to put yourself in Ethan's shoes, but rarely goes beyond that fleeting thought in the mind.But as mentioned, at least it didn't degenerate into over the top silliness, keeping itself in check most of the time in seriousness, and allowing the top notch performances to continue to engage, with a number of side characters appearing to reinforce certain aspects of Ethan's life and add an expanded dimension to a man unfortunately cut down at his prime. It reminds us again to live life for what it is and to appreciate it to the max, and Sanjay Leela Bhansali has this beautifully crafted film to tell us just that. Highly recommended, and it goes into my shortlist as a possible addition amongst the best this year has to offer. It looks like the Hrithik-Aishwarya partnership continues its success." 
" Instant Classic","Well, the movie was really engaging and brilliantly made. Haven't seen an Indian movie with so much depth and purpose, and believe me I mean it. I loved it.I was reading some reviews, while 90% of reviews were positive, the remaining 10% reviews were truly conspiring against this movie. And would you believe when I say that many teenage girls have actually questioned Bansali's lack of use of Colors, Dancing and Singing. Well, they are teenagers and what can you expect from teenage girls other than singing-dancing romantic moods which they expect to be reality.Reality, my friends, is quite different from the nutty gritty rom-coms like Dilwale Dulhaniya Lejanyenge, where a hero(no pun intended) comes flying, singing, dancing and just takes away the girl with him. This is not what reality is like. Reality is painful and we better open up our eyes and face it.This movie is all about Reality, how a Guy faces all odds and decides to die with dignity. This is what is Guzarish. This is what Bansali has created--A Grayish World full of colors of human emotions and magic. Hats Off. Nuff said." 
" Absolute Must See film -- 'come fall back in love with life'","Yes, "Guzaarish" is THAT good."Guzaarish" will not just upgrade your expectation of what is possible to achieve through the medium of film. "Guzaarish" will change your life.Easily the best film of 2010 -- anywhere -- "Guzaarish" joins the ten or so truly seminal movies throughout cinema history that are so groundbreaking and perfectly executed that we leave the experience seeing the world, even our own lives, in some fundamentally different way.SEE THIS FILM."Guzaarish" is the masterpiece of famed director Sanjay Leela Bhansali ("Black", "Devdas", etc.) who here not only directed but wrote the script, co-produced the film, and composed the music.The core storyline is borrowed from the 1981 classic "Whose Life Is It Anyway?", in turn adapted from the Broadway and West End multi-award-winning play of the same title: an artist (originally a sculptor, here a great magician), quadriplegic after an accident, when his internal organs start failing petitions a court for the right to end his own life, inciting a whirlwind of controversy in the lives of all those who love and care for him. But do not be deterred by the bleak-sounding premise. Through the genius of Bhansali -- and actors Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan -- "Guzaarish" transcends any and all preconceptions. "Guzaarish" becomes a joyous celebration of Life, of living every moment to the full and living with dignity.Mr Bhansali stated at the music launch that unless both Mr Roshan and Ms Rai signed for the project, he would not have attempted this film.The resulting film proves Bhansali's point: no other actors but the individually so-gifted Mr Roshan and Ms Rai -- AND their matchless on screen synergy together -- could have brought "Guzaarish" its power and magic.But in the safe hands of Bhansali, Roshan, and Rai you really will 'come fall back in love with life'."Guzaarish" joins my personal list of the 10 Best Films Ever Made." 
" Guzaarish -- Class Apart","Finally, we have a movie to appreciate by heart. I was so much satisfied when i came out of the cinema hall. With no unpractical things happening out there, the movie deserves only one word, marvelous..!! By Heart i would like to thank Sanjay Bhansali For delivering a movie like this, and Hritik and aishwarya For their delightful work, which deserves standing applause..!! the movie is so well crafted that you cannot take your eyes of the screen,and in case you do,you gotta be missing something.. With superb cinematography, songs, story and every thing related, this film is simply a class apart..! if you are in a habit of watching class movies, go just watch it... full thumbs up to the movie!!!!" 
" Guzarish is a amazing piece of work by Sanjay Leela Bhansali","For those who really like Movies with Good Story and acting. I will recommend them to watch "Guzarish". Its a Excellent piece of work by Sanjay Leela Bansali, with a Brilliant acting by "Ritik Roshan" and "Ashwariya Rai", with a great story line.The story line is great and contain human touch for the plot created for a paralyzed person. I can say it cannot be more better to synchronized with the flow of the story and is very very well acted by both Ritik Roshan and Ashwariya Rai.Again the dance by Ritik Roshan was amazing and there is no doubts about his dancing in the Indian Film Industry at this movement." 
" Take a Bow Mr.Bhansali, this is your Jewel Crown","I watched Guzarish a good 24 hours back and I am still not able to think anything else except the movie. This is a rare piece of art.Hrithik has raised the bar for himself after this performance.His eyes does all the talking and he has completely gone under the skin of the character. Aishwarya, as usual, does justice to her talent.Bhansali has woven some wonderful moments together in this rare piece of art, which deserves appreciation. Every frame is beautifully presented and it works like a visual treat to the audience.Thank you Mr.Bhansali for giving a film which will be remembered for its quality and not the numbers on the box office chart.I highly recommend this movie to everyone who adores the magic of sensitive cinema." 
" Lovely movie.","I was not hoping much from Sanjay Leela Bhansali since Saawariya but i was wrong. When the trailer first came out i said that i will only watch the movie because i am a fan of both Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai B. When the first few images came out i was like wow, looks good. And than, when the film came out i was first in line to buy the tickets... When the movie began, i was feeling weird but that weirdness just ran away... The movie is excellent.Hrithik Roshan gave a life-time performance in this film and he looked very handsome. Aishwarya Rai B was looking beautiful as ever. All her costumes,make-up and hair was really nice. I love the flower on her hair. Made her looks like a lovely Red Rose. SLB did an amazing job.Guaarish is a must see movie of the year. Go see now...My review: 9/10" 
" A request for a one-way ticket","Sanjay Leela Bhansali returns with Guzaarish, a dramatic musical feature which tells the story Ethan Mascarenhas, a former successful magician who has been entirely paralysed since a tragic stage accident. After 14 years of immobility, a highly cynical and humorous Ethan, who has found success as a radio anchor and as an author, is exhausted and he willingly files an appeal to the court for mercy killing, also known as euthanasia. There begins a true moral dilemma which provokes many contradicting thoughts among those who surround Ethan, which include his devoted nurse for the last 14 years, Sofia D'Souza, a beautiful, serious and yet caring woman who first takes Ethan's decision as an insult to her long-standing selflessness, and of course among the viewers themselves.Guzaarish is without a doubt an interesting film to watch, it is generally restrained in its portrayal of emotions, but at times -- the complete opposite. In a way it is a lot like Bhansali's pre-previous venture Black. It revolves around Anglo-Indian people, it is mostly in English, it is aided by lavish sets and costumes, the cinematography is stupendous, and the entire atmosphere is dark, dim and beautiful, filled with fantastic songs and a wonderful background score. In that sense, the movie is a true visual and musical treat. With the exception of Khamoshi, all of Bhansali's films have been glossy and extravagant, a style which was very appreciated by some, but many have considered it pretentious, snobbish, and a little hard to get into and relate to.Guzaarish can be looked at from different angles. From one side, it can be accused of supporting mercy killing, which is unacceptable, but from the other, it's deeply devastating to know that a person cannot even move to end his life when he wants to. Both sides give the film a rather depressing feel despite the fact that Bhansali tries hard to lift the viewers' spirit by building a narrative that is full of positive and hopeful songs about the beauty of life and some breathtaking nature landscapes. The courtroom scenes are well portrayed, with one scene in which Ethan tries to illustrate the level of his agony through one 60-second "trick", being one of the film's most impressive. At the same time, the film's final scene is extremely manipulative, long and over-dramatised, being one of the film's biggest flaws.Where the film scores big time except for its artistic portrayal of the rich cultural lifestyle of Portuguese-influenced Goa, it is definitely in the acting department. Hrithik Roshan wonderfully plays Ethan's hidden pain, his sense of irony, his great good-humour, and his love for those who surround him. Bhansali has once said that he is the only director who knows how to use Aishwarya Rai's beauty in his films and the one capable of extracting the best out of her acting skills. He once again proves to be right, as Rai delivers a brilliant, elegant and graceful portrayal of Sofia, effectively creating a rather tough screen persona, and yet letting the viewer sense her very soft inside, her love, goodwill and kindness. I would also like to mention her "Udi" dance performance, which is simply astonishing.The supporting cast includes the fantastic Shernaz Patel, who once again delivers an impressive act after her performance as a loving mother in Black. Nafisa Ali is still beautiful as Ethan's mother, and her monologue in court in support of her son is very touching. Rajit Kapoor is good as the prosecutor and boy has he changed since his appearances in Shyam Benegal's movies such as Mammo and The Making of The Mahatma. Aditya Roy Kapur is okay as Ethan's fan. All said and done, Guzaarish is a watchable movie which is generally moving, well scripted and very well acted. It is an extremely eye and ear-pleasing picture thanks to its cinematographic excellence and great musical numbers composed by Bhansali himself, but it has its share of minuses, and the film's final scene is example to that." 
" Just outstanding, amazing, brilliant, tooooooooooo goooooood","This is one of the best performance by Hrithik, wonderfully woven, every frame by frame, by Sanjay. Aishwarya is good, much better than her previous performances this year, Shernaz Patel and Suhel Seth performed brilliantly in their roles. Aditya Roy Kapoor needs special mention too. He is also outstanding and shows good promises as a forthcoming good actor to watch out for. Overall the movie is excellent. Hrithik once again proves why he is in the top league of actors today, excelling in all fields, be it acting, dancing emoting....just about everything. I am just too amazed by the movie and especially by the performance of Hrithik. He is totally a magician, both in the movie as well as in his acting.....My GUZAARISH.........please go and watch this movie guys and gals.....u will love it." 
" Bas Itni Si Guzaarish Hai to Mr. Bhanshali to continue making such movies !!!","I still remember the very first promo of Guzaarish !!! A lot of unanswered questions were raised in my mind which made me uncertain about the movie.Every trailer and I used to think on what will the movie be all about and one fine day I came to know about the subject making me more uncertain. I doubted how will this be treated and wasn't sure what was Aishwarya doing in Guxaarish.Finally yesterday Nov 19, 2010 when the movie started @ noon, I kept on thinking what next and got so engrossed that post the first 40 minutes of mind blowing performance by Hrithik Roshan followed with applauding performances by him, Aishwarya and others, the only thing that I remembered was being stunned with Ethan's Guzaarish (so to say SLB's thought).I might have seen other movies which covered certain special characters (Ethan) but this is truly a very well made masterpiece and deserves applaud with a 12000 surround sound effect – IMAX effect !!! SLB ensured all issues covered and a well thoughtful climax, confident this would leave you stunned too.Another best part that I would like to shared will you all is that post climax and the final laughter, you might not feel the effect immediately but when you leave the auditorium and think for a minute, you would feel the a Deep Impact of the movie, the characters, performances and the climax !!!! My Guzaarish to all the viewers is please do not expect anything when you go to watch the movie since you need to go through the Guzaarish Experience by yourself.God Bless SLB and Hrithik !!!" 
" Wonderful film with stunning performance by Hrithik n others!! Two thumbs up!","Just watched the film "Guzaarish" today.. I have to admit it met my expectations n delivered much more. It is a wonderfully told story which is artistic at heart. It will be more liked by the true good-story-acting-experience loving spectators. But everyone will be mesmerized by this beauty of a film. The songs though neither full in the film except 'udi', perfectlly matched the emotions of the film. Specially 'tera zikr hai', 'sau gram zindagi' n 'its a beautiful world' sung by Hrithik himself stands out.. Now for the acting part, i really don't have a proper adjective to describe Hrithik Roshan.. He is amazing,stunning,brilliant,mindblowing to name a few. He will make u laugh n cry at same time. Aishwarya Rai Bachhan also shines n enacts her role with brilliance n grace. Overall, its a true cinematic experience, with an amazing finale.. still visualising the last scene.. Don't miss this masterpiece by Sanjay Leela Bhansali.. Its a 10/10!" 
" Stunning Performances by Hrithik and Aishwarya","The best Indian movie which i have ever seen.. must watch Guzaarish tells the story of magician Ethan Mascarenhas (Hrithik Roshan), who is completely paralyzed in the lower half of the body, including both legs after one of his magic tricks' goes awry. Confined to a wheel-chair, Ethan is nursed by Sofia (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) and both share a silent, but deep love. Ethan is a Radio Jockey at a FM Station called Radio Zindagi, where he spreads hope and laughter aplenty on his show despite the spinal injury that has left him immobilized.Fed up with his immobile existence, Ethan files a petition for mercy-killing at the court; a decision which leaves Sofia stunned. Devyani (Shernaz Patel), who is Ethan's lawyer friend supports his appeal in court, which has the endorsement of even Ethan's mother Isabel (Nafisa Ali). Shocked by this decision, Ethann's physician Dr. Nayak (Suhel Seth) persuades him to withdraw his appeal. While this courtroom drama is going on, Omar (Aditya Roy Kapur) enters Ethan's life and wants to learn magic from the master. Ethan decides to mentor Omar and thus gets a new aim in life.The bottom line is that Guzaarish is a special film and must seen for people who carry the love for the true cinema.Missing this one on the theaters would be a mistake.Rating - 10/10" 
" All Time Classic","Movies like this having perfect direction and exceptional performance by all actors will give Bollywood new dimension to fly high. It is truly classic; no movie ever expressed such level of love and maturity.As we all know Sanjay Leela Bhansali picked up very sensitive topic of mercy killing(Enthunasia). So if you are looking for comedy or typical emotional drama, this movie is not for you.This movie just take us apart from typical Bollywood experience to a serious matured cinema.This movie is simply perfect and may be the best way to describe condition give rise to appeal for Enthunasia. You can't find and flaws in acting, direction, music, screenplay.This movie may not be best box office play. As this movie is targeting very matured audience(less than 10% of the world). Who can put themselves in the sufferer's shoes and can experience what the patient feels and secondly, who can experience the glory of divine love - which is essentially godly thing gifted to us.I believe that mercy killing may be the best when we are suffering constant pain and we know that thing can never never be improved.Regarding performance: One of the audience said - Sanjay has very little to do with Hirthik. Hrithik is god. Aishwarya is also outstanding.Perfection is the key.Bad part of it can be: It will increase suicides and appeal for mercy killing. But they are right at their point and we should not stop them to take decision about their life." 
" How come this movie be a flop? People do need some brain now a days I guess!!","This movie needs no reviews. If IMDb allowed less words or a single one even, I would have wrote just "AWSOME".. and this one word explain everything.To my surprise I was reading the box office reviews and found that the movie has badly flopped. And the only thing I could figure out that people doesn't have even mind to understand movies or to be precise, Cinema. This movie is an art in every direction, a complete movie i would say after a long time from bollywood. Be it the story, acting, music, message or direction. All the team has done a great job done and very well done.I was never a fan of H. Roshan before this movie (even now) but the acting of this actor has proved something out of the box. It's just the face expressions in the whole movie and a very difficult job to do. Mr. Roshan if you are somehow reading this I would like to tell you that SRK doesn't even match your performance (as to my knowledge that SRK won the best actor award for My name is Khan), honestly not a bit. But awards doesn't matter or even the box office revenues too, as you have done a job that would be remembered for a long time. I hardly watch movies twice but for guzarish that's not the case. I watched it once and enjoyed the movie as a whole and on the second next day I watched it again only for roshan's acting.I still can't believe how this movie could be a flop?? Man!! I feel sorry for the team but they should must read the critic and viewer's reviews.Great Movie!" 
" Its just WoW!!! and a must watch for mature guys...","No doubt S.L.Bhansali has again sparkled with his direction, but this time also with this beautiful concept. And Hrithik has just come up with flying colours in acting; everyone else has also acted well. The theme did not seem to lost at any point of time of the full movie. The end was predictable, but the performances and dialogues were nicely crafted to make the public stick to the movie. for me, its another amazing and touching movie after 'Taare Zammen Par'.Also there are some nice stage-performances by Hrithik, also by Ash. But this his focus was more on acting. Music was appealing and sung by many singers. Also Hrithik sings an English number, which was soothing and very much attached to the theme.May be youth(children) may not understand the gravity-quotient, but its a must-watch for adults."
