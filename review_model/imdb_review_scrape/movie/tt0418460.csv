" Akshay says no to Priyanka. I wouldn't.","'Aitraaz' is another fare made by the directors duo Abbas-Mustan. And once again, it is... well, unoriginal. 'Disclosure' is the word. However, speaking objectively, I found Aitraaz totally enjoyable and intriguing, and was thoroughly entertained by the proceedings. The direction was very good and the film was well-executed. It is about a man named Raj who is accused of trying to molest his old manager's young wife Sonia, who actually happens to be his ex-girlfriend, while in fact, she was the one who tried to sexually harass him and he refused, being a married man. Well, this is not very believable, but that's another story. This case is taken to court where Raj's wife Priya, who is a lawyer and who has full trust in her husband, decides to fight his case against seasoned lawyer Patel who represents Sonia. There start the film's most entertaining and interesting sequences. Aitraaz stars Akshay Kumar as Raj, and he does well. Kareena Kapoor is also very good as his protective wife Priya, though she has little to do until the film's last few scenes. But Aitraaz fully belongs to Priyanka Chopra, who is simply amazing in an all-out villainous turn as the vicious and devious manipulator Sonia. She is so sexy and attractive that it sounds puzzling that someone could reject her. This is among her most memorable performances. Other cast members include Amrish Puri in one of his last film appearances, and Paresh Rawal, who is outstanding as the witty and funny lawyer Patel. The film's soundtrack, by Himesh Reshammiya, was not that enjoyable according to me. The ending was very good. Aitraaz may not be exceptional, it may not be original, but it is a very entertaining movie. I recommend you to watch it mainly for Priyanka Chopra." 
" Aitraaz is a remake of 'Disclosure' but is very watchable.","Coming from the celebrated directorial team of 'Baazigar' (*Shah Rukh Khan) and 'Soldier' (*Bobby Deol), this one merits watching. The plot outline of Barry Levinson's gripping 1994 drama 'Disclosure' (starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore) has been nicely Indianized. There is no question that it is a remake of that Hollywood production, although the latter had a second plot-twist that Aitraaz doesn't provide.Chances are that majority of the Indian audience may not have seen Disclosure and, therefor, will love Aitraaz. It is again proved conclusively that a good story-line and good storytelling are two absolute essentials in making a good film. Look at 'Ashoka' (starring Shah Rukh Khan). Lush photography, proved story-material, and what happens? Why does it bomb at the box office? Simply because such a gorgeous story wasn't told with consistency and well.It happens. A proved material may bomb on revision because of uninspired direction (example: Hitchcock's 1960 classic 'Psycho' remade in 1998 by Gus Van Sant). Sometimes the opposite happens: 2001 remake of 1960's 'Ocean's Eleven' actually eclipsed the original.See Aitraaz. The soundtrack is scintillating. The story is good. The direction is superb. Priyanka Chopra is exceptional. Kareena Kapoor is superb. Akshay Kumar is adequate. You'll like the film." 
" Copy cat movie which is watchable","The first time I started watching this movie, in first ten seconds I realize that this is copy cat from movie "Disclosure". (I doubt if director has actually read the original novel). The scene where Raj pats his secretary's bottom directly gave me this hint. I was very disappointed, and then watch this movie, just for the sake of watching without any interest. But later, when I saw it on Television, I found it interesting. Right from the songs, music, story-telling, acting, everything is great. Raj who is now married and living happy life, gets a shock when his ex-girlfriend enters in his life as his Boss. She demands having sex with him, and he refuses. Hurt Priyanka (Boss/ and ex girlfriend) put a blame on him, as a rapist. Raj certainly not happy with this, puts a case on her in court. Finally with the help of his lawyer wife Kareena he proves that women can sometime have negative characteristics in case of sex. The story actually starts with the meeting of Kareena and Akshay, and slowly catch the main theme. Songs are pretty good and so overall music. Actingwise, Akshay is very good. Kareena and Priyanka are impressive in their characters. Director has done an excellent job, in bringing out drama slowly in the movie. Overall though, it is a copy cat movie, you will not regret watching it. (Now I own DVD of this movie.)" 
" AYE-traaz","Aitraaz Caught this movie on DVD last night. I've got only 2 words... WATCH IT!!! Priyanka Chopra has really established herself in this Abbas Mustan flick. Albeit, this movie is not in the same league as some of the class efforts from this director duo, it keeps the viewers plugged in through the end (partially due to Priyanka of course!) Why does Kariena always become the scapegoat in Bollywood movies where ravishing beauties play cameo roles. Then it was Ajnabee, now it is Aitraaz, there it was Bips, here it is Pri.The court scenes were drawn out a little bit and were a bit unrealistic and crude, but other than that, it was a really cool flick.... it is Priyanka all the way! She has done the romantic, modelling and vengeful scenes with passionate energy and great elegance, which should get her the filmfare for the best supporting artist (Rani will give her a tough fight thanks to the Yas Raj rigging factor.. no offense to Rani here). She not only clobbered Kariena, but even sidelined Akshay Kumar. She might be a serious contender to Bipasha if she keeps this tempo going.Paresh Rawal's court performance reminded me of his role in Akele Hum Akele Tum, while Annu Kapoor has done a sufficient job. The comedy track has been understandably toned down and the music was mediocre but was compensated for by the superb locations, picturization, cinematography, and costumes.The climax was good.. although it was no big riddle, it was pretty realistic. I shall say no more.Verdict: As a Priyanka and Abbas-Mustan Fan, I loved this movie. It is quite different and stylish. This is worth watching!" 
" Sexy Priyanks, good Paresh Rawal in overlong remake of 'Disclosure'","This film is long but quite enjoyable. There is perhaps one twist too many and some needless shenanigans towards the end could have been avoided. Still, its fairly absorbing. Priyanka excels as the sexy vamp and burns up the screen with her presence. Kareena is saddled with the straight role but does well. Paresh Rawal steals the show as an adept lawyer. Akshay Kumar is alright although he essentially plays the victim in the film. The plot is a variant on the Hollywood thriller Disclosure, but there's a lot of Indian spice including some catchy songs. Watchable.Overall 6/10" 
" Kareena Kapoor did and excellent job!!","When i first saw this movie in the theaters back in 2004 November, I was really interested in the roles of the characters. Kareena did and amazing job being as a lawyer and she didn't over act it at all. She knows how to act and knows what to do as well. When i saw Priyanka doing that negative role, i was thinking wow shes doing a pretty good job as that. I give her credit for that as well. Ashkay did an okay job. Its mostly Kareena Kapoor & Priyanka who stole the show. I love the part when Kareena starts fight with Priyanka in the office and in the court as well. It brings suspense, drama, and you can feel the hatred between one another. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 for sure!! These directors know how to make a good film. I hope they make a part two to this movie. Please make Aitraaz part 2!! I will be a massive hit. The box office in Canada for the movie Aitraaz was way better than Veer Zaara. Everyone that i know of liked Aitraaz so much!! Goob job Kareena & Priyanka. Kareena Kapoor is the best actress in the world!! Everyone...you have to see Bewafaa, Kyon Ki and Dosti. Those movies are excellent!!" 
" More than just a Bollycat","The only thing I have to add to the other reviews is that you may be fooled into thinking you know what will happen next -- more than once, in fact -- but just when you think this is just a Bollycat version of DISCLOSURE, there are a few plot twists remaining. Actually, the film starts off as though it is going to be a goofy romantic comedy, but there are many changes in store.The performances are good all around. I thought Kareena (the most gorgeous woman on the planet) Kapoor was wasted, until the final scenes when she steps forward to do battle. Her character's closing arguments are actually more balanced than the message of DISCLOSURE, which I thought simply demonized Demi Moore's character. And the bad girl, Sonia (Priyanka Chopra) ends up seeming pathetic, not simply evil. Can it be that justice is not the same as revenge? My only complaint is that the music and dance numbers are less than memorable, although not bad by any means. If you like Bollywood, definitely see this one." 
" After the Box Office dud, Taarzan; the wonder car, Abbas Mustan are back with the bang","Abbas Mustan are back with the bang and this time with a bold theme which tackles with the issue of sexual harassment, with an exclusive twist by placing the man as a victim and the woman as an aggressor. Till now the moviegoer has witnessed man-sexually-molesting-woman but this time its opposite. It has been inspired by a Hollywood flick DISCLOSURE.Raj Malhotra (Akshay Kumar), who works for a cell phone company, is popular amongst his circle of friends and work colleagues. But his world comes crashing down when he meets Sonia (Priyanka Chopra) again.Sonia is an ambitious model with great aspirations. She knows what she wants in life. She is prepared to achieve her goals, whatever the price. Her fundas in life are crystal clear: Nothing shall come in between her wants and desires.Raj is well aware that Sonia knew only one way to live and that was her way. And one fateful evening, things did not go her way. Sonia brings Raj's world to a screeching halt.Raj's wife Priya (Kareena Kapoor), once a lawyer herself, is prepared to do anything to protect her husband's honor and dignity.The deceitful dusk that threatens to put Rajs honor at stake, finds an adamant Priya at the opposing end. And from a content housewife, Priya becomes a woman with a mission that she must accomplish. She is now Rajs partner in more ways than one.Thrown into this web of deceit is Rajs boss, Ranjit Roy (Amrish Puri), who happens to be Sonias husband. He is a mere pawn in her hands.The drama has just begun. The court is far from adjourned and what happens next you have to watch by yourself.Akshays performance in a serious silent role is satisfactory and the audience will sure sympathize with his character. Kareena's part as a wife is impressive. But she fails to make a mark in the role of a lawyer. AITRAAZ belongs to Priyanka Chopra completely. She plays a glamorous role with a gray shade. Priyanka gets an opportunity to bear her claws and she does it with complete understanding of the character. She sneaks her way through the role like an expert, drawing audience hatred the way a magnet collects iron filings.Paresh Rawal and Anu Kapoor have made their wonderful input to the film as lawyers. A good courtroom drama viewer will see after a long time, after Damini (93). In a long courtroom scene, Paresh Rawal is able to keep the viewers engaged in the proceedings while Anu Kapoor appears in an impressive role after a long time. His last best performance was in Gardish (93). And the same year he started working for zee TVs program Antakshari.On the whole, AITRAAZ is a well-crafted thriller that meets the expectations in each and every department from story, direction till performances and music. Its a must to see movie. 3 1/2 Out of 5" 
" Voice of Bollywood Vixen.","Mukta Arts and Abbas Mastan-this dhoti clad duo have unique angle to film making as they did with "Humraaz", which was one of the most entertaining films of the last decade. This duo have choreography style that is innovative and refreshing compared to the pot-boiler tasteless gyrating that is usually seen in Salman Khan movies. The music of Himmesh Reshmiya is always a distinguishing feature of their movies. There are two numbers that have his stamp. There are two actors that stand out-one is Paresh Rawal- this actor can turn a scene however short into a hilarity. As a prosecuting attorney Rawal is the Court-jester bringing the audience down with some of the best dialog in the movie. In fact A-M duo cleverly use this scene as their comedy interlude that is by tradition reserved for children of lesser talent like Shakti Kapoor, Johny lever and the clan. There have been seductive vixens and stunning looking actresses on the Indian cinema but Priyanka Chopra is an all in one. This Chopra girl who made an entry with "The Hero" never looked more gorgeous-this woman certainly has the skills with the killer looks. Akshay Kumar is acting, when you consider that the Indian audience is used to the overacting from the likes of SharRukh Khan. Kareena Kapoor is okay but she could have been more dramatic in the Court, instead of her parrot like dialog delivery. I enjoyed this movie considering the recent filth in the name of Cinema that has been coming out of the "Maximum City"." 
" Indianised Version of Hollywood's Disclosure","Corporate hotshot Raj Malhotra (Akshay Kumar) has an extremely successful career as an Engineer the biggest Mobile maker and service provider and has a lovely wife Priya (Kareena Kapoor). When all seems to go well, enter Soniya (Priyanka Chopra) young sultry wife of Voice's septuagenarian Chairman Rakesh Roy (Amrish Puri). Roy appoints his wife as the MD of Voice. While the new MD announces the promotions at the Annual day, she throws a surprise and Raj is inducted into the board of directors instead of an ordinary promotion. While everyone around Raj congratulate him, Raj is pensive.Soniya throws a party where she makes advances at Raj. But, Raj is not amused. A disgruntled Sonia files a sexual harassment lawsuit. Raj tries his level best to convince people that he is innocent. But,it seems to him that the whole world is against him and nobody wants to believe his truth. Only his wife Priya stands by him and decides convinces Raj to fight the case and prove his innocence. The rest of the story is a courtroom battle.Aitraaz seems inspired (err copied) from the 1994 Michael Douglas, Demi Moore Hollywood flick Disclosure. Although the story of the movie is quite predictable, it definitely has a perspective in its subject. The idea of presenting 'affairs' where the female is the aggressor is different from the generally accepted norm that the male is the typical aggressor in an affair.The story has been dealt well, of course not without funnies usually shown in Indian Courtroom dramas especially funny dialogues like 'Insaan do kisam ke hote hain – Mard aur Aurat' (there are two kinds of humans – Male and female), and the bad joke about bottoms by Paresh Rawal. Ah, when will Bollywood make good courtoom drama.Of all performances, Priyanka Copra steals the show with her stunning looks and villainousness that fit the role of Soniya. Kareena plays the sweet girl turned dutiful wife who can be a 'savitri' while defending her husband. Akshay Kumar has done a good job too. Paresh Rawal and Anu Kapoor show their drama skills as lawyers. Amrish Puri doesn't have much of a role anyways.The film's music is not very memorable except for the first song 'Gila Gila'. Although the song is 'hummable', it would disappoint you with poor choreography." 
" Stellar, Bollywood Cinema should be proud, even if it's a copy!","I believe that would be Hollywood's 'Disclosure' starring Demi Moore to be exact. In its Bollywood makeover, you have Kareena Kapoor, Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra as the lead characters. Akshay plays (Raj Malhotra) a business executive at a top mobile phone company which is owned by Ranjit Roy (Amrish Puri). One day, Raj tells a friend/co-worker of his that he needs a house keeper and his friend decides to send him one. Meanwhile, Raj's neighbour Barrister Ram Choitrani (played perfectly by Annu Kapoor) had also placed an ad in a newspaper advertising for a secretary. Priya Saxena (Kareena Kapoor) has just graduated from law school as is searching for a job when she comes across this ad in the newspaper and decides to go and apply for the job the next day. Along the way (and in a very hilarious scene) the housekeeper Raj's friend is sending gets confused by all the lookalike houses and goes to the wrong house (Barrister Choitrani's ) while Priya, who had stopped to pray at a temple then got flustered after wards, goes to the wrong house as well. In essence, the two ladies switch places unknowingly. Raj upon seeing Priya falls in love with her and hires her right away, but unknown to Priya, she is being hired as a housekeeper. The barrister, confused but happy that the housekeeper is happy to work for less, hires her as an co-attorney without even checking her credentials.Sooner than later though, the truth comes out but Priya forgives Raj and they get married (Don't Miss the Uber hot 'Gela, Gela, Gela' song that is played during their honeymoon) and the barrister as well, marries the maid. After the honeymoon, Priya announces that she is pregnant and Raj, though happy begins to make plans to accommodate the child. He wants to buy a new house, take out a loan etc. etc. But this would require a promotion at work, which in due time news starts to surface. He (Raj) is so sure that he is about to be promoted to a very comfortable position when Ranjit Roy arrives to do the honours. But along with the festivities comes an unforeseen whirlwind in the manner of Roy's new and very young wife Sonia (played by Priyanka Chopra in arguably her most career defining role). Raj soon becomes very uncomfortable when he doesn't get the position he was gunning for but an even higher one when the honours are announced by the new Mrs. Roy with her agendas lurking not too far behind. Before long, it is revealed that Raj had a past with Sonia and though married and established, Sonia still carries a torch for Raj and is hellbent on winning him back even if it mean destroying both their marriages. Don't miss the ever hilarious and multi-talented actor Paresh Rawal in a special appearance as Advocate Patel, Sonia's lawyer when all goes to the dogs. Kareena Kapoor also turns in a great performance. Don't miss other great songs like 'I wanna make love to you' and 'Tela Tum' both performed by Ms. Chopra who seems to have a knack for these sort of things. Stellar casting and acting!" 
" Powerful performances and gripping storyline!!!","Abbas-Mustan live up to their expectations once again! For the first time, Bollywood sees such a shocking role reversal. Priyanka does an extraordinary job and is easily the best part of this film. She plays her role of an excessively aggressive lady very convincingly with passion. Supposedly the supporting actress, she easily overshadows her co-stars. Akshay, nonetheless, also gave a great performance and proves he can play any role. Kareena was slightly disappointing, especially in comparison with her past performances and with Priyanka. However, the excellent script does not let this be very noticeable. Songs are not bad. My favorites are Yeh Dil Tumpe Aa Gaya and I Want to Make Love to You." 
" The best of PC !!!!","Priyanka Chopra has never been better. A negative role in this movie. She did it so well that she never acted in a negative role (till 2018).Plus the movie had lovely music.Watchable...." 
" Poor yet entertaining rip off of Disclosure","Aitraaz is nothing but a rip-off of 1994 Hollywood film Disclosure which starred the sexy Demi Moore and Michael Douglas.While Priyanka Chopra did her bit in a seductive vamp role, there were several laughable scenes like "Kuch thanda loge or you want something hot!" This was another poor imitation of Sharon Stone's famous leg crossing scene from Basic Instinct, another erotic thriller.What's disappointing is the performance of Akshay Kumar in this film although he had limited scope due to his role. Kareena does well by defending her husband in the court. The show stealer apart from Priyanka is Paresh Rawal. While Abbas Mastan have put in a few twists more than required, the courtroom drama is entertaining to say the least." 
" Amazing psychological thriller","This movie was so totally and definitely amazing Storyline is good screenplay is good editing is good direction is good Songs are really enjoyable Akshay Kumar was superb priyanka did amazing in her negative role kareena was outstanding amrish is remarkable paresh is superb in a small role other cast is excellent 8/10" 
" Disclosure","Aitraaz is a remake of Disclosure, quite a hatke topic for Abbas-Mustan however the treatment could be much better. The film starts off with typical comedy, romance between Akshay and Kareena, only when Priyanka enters things look better, the flashback portion is well handled, the twist at interval is good while second half too gets better. Though the courtroom drama could be better, it jars and also suddenly Kareena becoming a lawyer yet the end is goodDirection by Abbas Mustan is good, he could resist however from putting comedy at odd places Music by Himesh is good, Gela Gela is good, rest songs are good too however the choreography is crude at timesAkshay Kumar underplays his part well, Kareena is good too Priyanka in her first author backed role tries very hard does deliver well too though at times her effort shows too much Amrish Puri gets less scope and is okay, Paresh Rawal is superb, Annu Kapoor too excels, Upasna Singh is adequate,Vivek Shauq lends some fun moments,rest are okay"
