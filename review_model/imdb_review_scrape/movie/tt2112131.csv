" Are we that dumb?","Dabangg had a good storyline but not that good, you cannot clear 2 movies from that same story. Dabangg 2 has no story, only action. It seems like nowadays money has no meaning, it can be wasted like throwing it down the drain.Actually, it has nothing so you cannot criticize anything out of it. It is so stupid that you'll feel like one when you try to judge it in terms of good or bad. The makers of this movie knew that this stew is overcooked, so they started making money by roping small brands and advertising in the movie itself.Sometimes I feel like, "are we so dumb that we'll let this movie earn hundreds of crores?". Someone has written aptly that this movie makes dabangg look like a masterpiece." 
" Baseless","Only meant for salman khan's fans.. Not a good movie at all.Baseless action... Is he immortal while fighting? I seriously hate this kind of action.Please, bring standard to your movies salman.And get out of this masala type money making movies and make something different.. Getting tired of this silly action. argh!Typical nonsense movie. Watch it only if you are salman khan's fan. Or else don't waste your money. We really are short of good movies..Please bollywood..give some sense to these actors. Stop encouraging salman's baseless masala movies.." 
" A waste of time and money","It is suggested to watch this movie if * you really want to get frustrated. * You think you have lived life enough. * Want to torture your enemies * You want to witness the most foolish filmmakers ever. * want to surprise yourself by the most retarded creatures ever * Want to prove yourself that man evolved from Monkeys. * Want to know what would have happened if humans were born without brains. * You have lot of time to waste. * you are too frustrated by living in the civilized world.( I think Mayans predicted the release of this movie and hence they called it a dooms day ! )" 
" Absolute nonsense,crap movie!!","Story of a 100cr movie:1.Villains bro tries to kidnap girl from wedding ceremony. 2.Salman Khan kills the kidnapper. 3.Main villain pushes salmons pregnant wife from staircase and shoots at salmons bro in revenge. 4.Salmon khan kills the villain.100cr for this ... pathetic... I guess we should ask Salmon khan to organize stage shows where his fans can see him flex his muscles and listen to his one liners..so that rest of India is spared form his shitty movies.. and for god sake m not a srk lover please... nd I think its high time now bollywood should be renamed as "sillywood"" 
" Made Dabangg look like masterpiece !!! such a big letdown","I just came from cinema having a nightmarish experience known as dabangg 2 . Now i have promised myself never to waste my hard earned money on Bollywood movies before reading reviews from GOOD, fair and unbiased critics. Dabangg 2 literally have nothing in it . At least dabangg 1 had some originality, some funny jokes and scenes and most importantly it had something new but dabangg 2 is nothing but a bad copy of D1. First of all, a "free-fund" advice to arbas khan, please don't direct a movie again . The reason dabangg 1 was a bit better was because of its director unlike now . So here is how i am going to rate this movie ;Direction = 2 story( was there a story ?) = 2 music = 6 acting = 5" 
" The Only Good Thing About Dabangg 2 Is It Doesn't Allow You To Sit Through The Whole Movie! GARBAGE!","So, I wasn't much looking forward to watch this and by an imminent release of Dabangg 3, I thought I could watch it.Blast, this is just another gimmick movie like Ek Tha Tiger or Bodyguard or Son Of Sardaar (Ajay Devgn starrer). The common thing between these were - they don't induce entertainment. Dabangg 2 is just another Salman Khan flick which doesn't intrigue, doesn't entertain, but bores you to such a great extent, you save the remaining 90 minutes of the second half.They thought Prakash Raj would make it like Wanted (another Sallu 'HIT' movie), but it fails. Arbaaz Khan sucks with direction, but Salman Khan helps a little. It is just like another sequel which lack the originality in plot and yet another saucy twist at the end. I quote "The gags, the stunts, the catch phrases, even the song placement at regular intervals give the film a very repetitive feel." So true!You may/may not enjoy this, but if you are serious movieholic who adores Hollywood movies, you might HATE the franchise forever!Chulbul Pandey is not arrogant, but the movie still keeps going because it isn't tedious like the first one. Dabangg 2 may qualify when it comes to monotony and clich√©s. But, let me remind you, this is no serious cinema! Watch at your own risk!WATCH OUT FOR: SALMAN KHAN'S adaptation to the wacky, witty policeman!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: Mild; double meaning jokes | Sex: No | Mouth-Kiss: No | Violence: Not really | Nudity: No" 
" Not good as expected","Theatre: Trivandrum Anjali Audience: Average Review: The movie didn't bring up anything as expected. Missing of story line was another factor to dislike. Very disappointed with the direction of Arbaaz Khan. Praksh Raj as villain has no impact on this movie. Chulbul Pandey the role by Salman Khan was OK but not excellent. From the start itself we get the feeling that there is hollow in the script. The stunt scenes had nothing special. Usual moves and all. And the climax, we feel like to end the movie they did something, that's all. I am really disappointed. Sorry5/10" 
" Disgusting","One of the worst movie I have ever seen, NO STORY, Sorry but People are so fool and Idiot, that they make movies like this a hit, this movie should be flop but I know it wont, Awful movie, A BIG LET DOWN, Stay Away.Plot Chulbul Pandey (Salman Khan) is transferred to Kanpur where he is in charge of the local police station. A rich schoolboy is kidnapped by thugs and Chulbul Pandey rescues him from a warehouse after beating up the gang of kidnappers. However, staying true to his reputation, Chulbul takes the ransom money for himself.Everything is now picture-perfect in his family. Chulbul has mended the relationship with his stepbrother Makkhi (Arbaaz Khan) and stepfather (Vinod Khanna). He is also happily married to Rajjo (Sonakshi Sinha).Somewhere in Kanpur, an assassin hired by Bachcha Bhaiya (Prakash Raj) murders a witness who was about to testify against him. Chulbul tracks the assassin down and kills him in a brawl at a local restaurant. Bachcha decides to ignore the threat posed by Pandey because he is trying to get elected into the local government. After several public altercations, Bachcha's brother convinces him to get rid of Pandey.Bachcha's brother threatens Chulbul's stepfather and says if Chulbul does not stop interfering with Bachcha's criminal activities, he will kill his whole family. Bachcha's brother then harasses a local girl who is about to get married. He says that he will not allow her to get married to anyone other than him. Chulbul Pandey stops Bachcha's brother from abducting the bride during her wedding and in the process kills him by breaking his neck. At this point, Bachcha Bhaiya promises to avenge the death of his brother.Chulbul then finds out that his wife Rajjo is pregnant. Everyone advises him to leave Baccha alone and think about his family. Chulbul gets life insurance and thinks about cutting down on his unique way of policing. However, Bachcha cannot forgive Pandey for killing his brother and says he will wait till he is elected to take care of him.Chulbul's stepbrother's wife (Mahi Gill) then visits them in Kanpur and tells them she's taking an new job as a teacher. Makkhi is inspired by her and asks Chulbul if he can become a police officer like him. They then go to see a prostitute dancing (Kareena Kapoor) later that night.Bachcha Bhaiya tracks down Makkhi and Rajjo when they are visiting a Hindu temple. Bachcha throws Rajjo off the stairs which causes her to have a miscarriage. Makkhi is shot in the shoulder trying to save Rajjo but fails. Chulbul and Rajjo lose their child and this causes Chulbul to go after Bachcha Bhaiya.Chulbul attacks Bachcha Bhaiya and his thugs on his own, killing half of them in the process. Chulbul then beats Bachcha Bhaiya and the police arrives. The police helps him kill Bachcha Bhaiya in a fake encounter. A year later Rajjo gives birth to a child after getting pregnant again." 
" not as EXpected!","What's Good: The return of Chulbul Pandey-Rajjo-Makkhi; the comedy; some songs; the direction & cinematography.What's Bad: The convenient story; the forced father-son & Mahie-Arbaaz trajectories; the whole feel like a wannabe clone of Dabangg; the irritating product placements.Loo break: Not Really.Watch or Not?: Watch it for Chulbul back in his game and if you're a fan of Salman.Can improved: the role of Prakash Raj is too small..we need him big like in 'Singham'!Remember when all Salman Khan movies started looking the same? This is just another chip off the old block. It's heart-warming to see that the extra reel from Dabangg was put to some good use.Our dear corrupt-but-good cop Chulbul Pandey (Salman Khan) has shifted base to Kanpur with wife Rajjo (Sonakshi Sinha), step-father Prajapati (Vinod Khanna) and brother Makkhi (Arbaaz Khan). Pandeyji even has some of his loyal constables transferred with him. As Kanpur begins to feel the heat of Chulbul's awesomeness, so does local-don-and-aspiring politician Thakur Bachcha (Prakash Raj). Bachcha and his spoilt, troublesome brothers are a menace to the town.When Bachcha's brother Gainda (Deepak Dobriyal) oversteps by threatening Prajapati and tries to abduct a girl from her wedding, Chubul Pandey breaks his neck. Caught up in the preparations for the elections, Bachcha denounces his brother and continues campaigning. There Chulbul bonds with his father and revels in the news of being a daddy soon. Even his dim-witted brother takes an interest in taking up a job.But it doesn't take long for Bachcha to remember his brother.Weak Script Analysis: If you're looking for something new in Dabangg 2, you will be disappointed. Dileep Shukla's script and screenplay is very similar to Dabangg; while this is amusing in some parts, it looks lazy in others. The jokes, action, dialogues seem like fall-outs from the old script. With Chulbul's mother out of the picture, his bonding with his father and brother stick out like a sore thumb. Makkhi missing his wife also seems half-baked. Even Bachcha's late revenge is something the writer alone can explain." 
" When will bollywood improve ?","Same old non-sense action, killing of people with no gravitational rules.Talaash was much much better than this crap.So eye irritating action sequences, it seems salman, akshay and ajay are going in only one direction - to make a fool of audience at any cost possible.Why doesn't somebody ask these bollywood directors to watch some Hollywood movies or in fact some good bollywood movies themselves .. to learn what kind of movies should be made.Acting - nothing to say, everybody knows when only mindless action and money is involved then acting has no space and preference. The only goal is to make brainless audience dance for a few moments and nobody cares that some people want to see the acting and story as well." 
" Dabangg 2:Salman Khan works,movie does not!","Dabangg 2 directed by Arbaaz Khan disappoints big time.Dabangg 2 turns out to be a dismissal when compared to Dabangg.Although Dabangg had no story.still it managed to entertain but Dabangg 2 has no story as well as there is very minimal entertaining moments.The movie has dozens and dozens of characters,many of them who are wasted.The action sequences are unexciting,since because it is the same repetitive action which we have seen in movies like Wanted,Rowdy Rathore,Khiladi 786 and even its predecessor Dabangg.The songs are bad.The music is sonorous.The dialogs are laughable.The direction by Arbaaz Khan is done to death Dabangg 2 works only for Salman Khan!Salman Khan,as always,gives a superb acting.Performances: Salman Khan,as mentioned above is the only saving grace of Dabangg 2.Prakash Raj is good too,but I find his villainous role to be a bit repetitive,first on Wanted,then,Bbuddah,then Singham and now Dabangg 2,he repeats the same act.Sonakshi Sinha is dull.Vinod Khanna is good.Arbaaz Khan,Deepak Dobriyal,Niketan Dheer and Mahie Gill are wasted.Manoj Pahwa provides some laughs.Kareena Kapoor sizzles in her item number,while Malika Arora Khan fizzles in her item number.All in all,Dabangg 2 is a bad successor of Dabangg.I am giving it a three on ten.Colossal Disappointment!" 
" Not even Close to Dabangg","I liked Dabangg and I believe it was a great experiment by Abhinav Singh Kashyap and it was different, Since they left out Abhinav Kashyap for the sequel expectations were not that high. well in Dabangg 2 Their was no Such thing as script and sense at all and Every thing was a bad copy of the original film and it was not even close to Dabangg the Music was bad, the item song was not as good as Munni and the direction was Poor. it was not even funny most of the jokes were really bad, the dialog's were poor and their were a lot of Brand Promotions which made it look like that you are paying to watch commercials. Dabangg had some great jokes like "Haathi k neechay agar Kuttay ki dumb ajaey" and The one where Salman said "Hum un kaminoo k bhaghwaan hain" but this humor is missing in Dabangg 2. Salman Khan was Good and he did his part well but the other actors were not that good, Parkash raj's Role was too Small and he didn't had any good dialog's to deliver and his part looked a little experimental, he was try to change his voice, Arbaz khan and vinod khanna were just below okay and Sonakshi's Acting was average. All in all Dabangg 2 is a big disappointment.it will earn much more than Dabangg but its not even close to it when it come to entertaining and letting go Abhinav Singh Kashyap was a big mistake.If you are thinking about watching it Save your time and Go for Tom cruise's "Jack Reacher" or wait for "Matru ki bijli KA Mandula"." 
" Even Salman Khan can't help this film that lacks a script","A lot of action, one liners and Salman Khan did not help this movie that lacked a script.The positives for this film would be the action, the few comedy scenes, a few good performances and the music. The action was top notch in this film as I found the climax for this film was better than the first film. The few comedy scenes were good such as when Chulbul is prank calling his Dad and pretending to be a girl. Salman Khan, Prakash Raj and Vinod Khanna put up some great performances. Salman Khan keeps you entertained and continues with his witty one liners. Prakash Raj delivered a good performance, but his performance was better in Singham and he needed more screen time in this film. Vinod Khanna had a bigger role in this film and played his character well. Fevicol and Dagabazz Naina are the best songs in this film and they looked good on screenThe negatives for this film would be the script, the awkward romantic scenes and the music. A very poor storyline, but I didn't expect it to have a good one since its a "masala" film. The scenes with Salman Khan and Sonakshi Sinha are very useless. Sonakshi Sinha cannot act. She has never had a significant role in any of her films as they were only hits because of the lead actor. Dabangg, Rowdy Rathore and Son of Sadaar were hits because of Salman, Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn. The other songs in this film were crap and useless in the film. The 'new' version of the title song is absolutely terrible as the original song was a 100x better than this one. Pandeyji Seeti is another terrible song which felt like it was forcefully put into the movie. The other romantic song is okay but you feel like why is it there in the first place.Overall, with its many faults, it is a one time watch for the action, good performances by Salman and Parkash, and a few songs. 5/10 ps Its time for actors like Salman, Akshay and Ajay to stop doing these masala films and choose films with a good script that can also entertain audiences because these types of films are ruining bollywood." 
" Even die-hard fans should avoid this lest they die-hard after this","Bad sequels are a bad thing, especially so if they have high expectations. Truth be told, i had enjoyed Dabangg a lot- it was a standard masala movie but the entertainment quotient was high, the treatment was different, the songs were catchy, it had right mix of emotion, comedy and action, and in Chhedi Singh, a worthy villain. Dabangg 2 on the other hand brings nothing new to the table- stale wine in antique bottle.Chulbul Pandey is back to clean up a new city this time round- Kanpur, he has a new nickname (Kungfu Pandey) and he has the license to kill, not necessarily thrill. The rest of the original cast including Sonakshi Sinha, Vinod Khanna, Tinnu Anand return to reprise their roles in unimpressive fashion, but the most valuable member of the team, Abhinav Kashyap does not - perhaps he too saw nothing of value in the script, and Arbaaz Khan makes a dud as his directorial debut- not even a patch on the original. the story is largely the same that we have seen in the recent spate of action comedies or whatever you want to call this breed of movies- our swashbuckling, superhuman, club smashing, rod bending, larger than life Robin Hood cop with questionable morals picks up a feud with the local alligator Baccha Singh, played by Prakash Raj (channelizing his Singham act) and his thuggee brothers, Genda and Chunni. In the meantime he also gets time to romance his missus and banter with his brother and dad. Things turn ugly when Chulbul gives a 180 degree spin to Genda, played by Deepak Dobriyal, who by the way is excellent in a short role. Rest of the movie is an insipid mishmash of unfunny one-liners, forgettable songs and slow motion fights. The feel is almost soap opera like, Salman looks like he is trying to have a good time but also looks tired and his left eye is positively droopy, probably cannot hide his neuralgia anymore. Sonakshi resembles an eggshell, Vinod Khanna rarely gets a good line and Arbaaz Khan is flatter than a railway track. And at the end, the manner in which Baccha is dispatched to his heavenly abode begs to ask the question why Chulbul took 2 hrs to decide his time was up and pump in some lead into him. Perhaps just to prolong our torture?Yes, the shirt does come off, Munni returns along with a tandoori chicken impersonating Kareena, and the ending promised more sequels- In the current mood of things I feel the next city Chulbul will clean up is Delhi, hope Abhinav Kashyap is back again. Yes the action is plenty, the cinematography largely good, and the movie will rake in big bucks. And why not, Salman Khan has done what even SRK failed to do, that is, clear the field - no major movie releasing in this holiday season in fear of Dabangg 2. External forces are in its favor, but not internal. Neither bigger and neither better than the original, Arbaaz Khan makes the mistake of sticking too close to THE formula. Even though this will be Bollywood's most successful franchise, a terrible story is a terrible story, and for me, even Salman Khan cannot save this turkey- Dabangg 2 gets a 5/10 and my advice to soak in the holiday spirit, watch The Hobbit again." 
" Movie is one time watch if songs are skipped.","Like some last movies of Salman Khan this movies is also disappointing one. Pandeji has taken transferred to Calcutta for wider business. He entertain well till interval with his unique and dabangg dialogs as well as acts. Pandeji troubles his dad and brother makhiji with love. But as he creates problem to local villain Bachaji as police officer the story seems to be started but it doesn't. Bachhaji's gang don't respect police which Pandeji can not accept. He meets Bachhaji in some party and introduce him self in stunning way. bachhaji's young brother is warns Pandeji's father and also troubles one local girl. When girl's father file FIR, Pandeji decide to teach lesson. Just before interval Pandeji kills Bachaji's brother in horrible way when he starts behaving more than his personality deserves that is the scene one would love in movie. Pandeji's brother turn into hero and joins police to be some thing, to earn name like Pandeji but fails when Bachaji kills Pandeji's bachha in Rajoo's womb in presence of Makhi Pandey. Pandeji gets angry when Rajoo ask him to take revenge. Pandeji enters into Bachaji's padav in stunning style, kills whole Bachhaji gang, Bachaji's brother, Bachhaji and movie ends before some story starts." 
" lacks the Midas touch of abhinav kashyap","when i saw dabanng 2 yesterday i felt disappointed,the movie clearly lacks the Midas touch of Anbhinav Kashyap. It just cannot set the bars set by dabanng. If u are a Salman khan fan you would love this movie. But if you are in search for content along with southern masala blam blam then you will be left hungry. Songs are good enough but it feels really irritating when you get less of a story and more songs popping in between every now and then.You can see "kung fu pandey" pulling out all kinds practically impossible stuff in the entire movie, its OK upto some level but an overdose of it kills the entertainment quotient. The biggest flaw of the movie is the director feels uncomfortable stepping out of his comfort lines and has just built up on the pillars of dabanng and there is nothing new in it. Give it a watch if you are a salman fan"
