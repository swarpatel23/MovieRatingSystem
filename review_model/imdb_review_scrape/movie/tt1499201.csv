" Old Wine in Old Bottle","Well let me start like this, a kid is constantly trying to make a house with sand. Initially he tries a lot but it does not take a shape. Then he makes some progress and it finally starts to look like a house. Then a wave comes and sweeps it all. That is the case with Anjaana Anjaani. Director Siddharth Raj Anand tries to do a lot in the first half but it never works. He takes a simple story and in some kind of a fascination to make it extra-ordinary and leaves it just as an ordinary film. Anjaana Anjaani is a weird story about two individuals Akash (Ranbir) and Kiara (Priyanka) who continuously try to commit suicide and God knows why, they never succeed. Until one day when they decide to live life for 20 days and do the stuff they want to do before they die. They go all over the place, trying to pick up girls for Akash who is still a virgin. They go swimming in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean which is just so stupid because Akash sets out to commit suicide in the first place because he was bankrupt. Suddenly he transforms into a spendthrift with branded clothes and accessories. Kiara wants to commit suicide because his fianc√©e Kunal (Zayed Khan) cheats on him with a firing from L.A. They go on a road trip to Las Vegas in Kiara's 'khatara' car "BLUSH". Ranbir runs into a gay who almost rapes him. Both Akash and Kiara gamble and win and finally start to feel for each other. Then when it was all going right Kiara suddenly realizes that she misses Kunal and Akash like a 'true lover' advices her to go back to him. But, she is not the old Kiara and soon realizes that Akash is her love. So she rushes to New York where they had decided to commit suicide on the eve of New Year. They find each other, and live happily ever after. Seriously who was Siddhath Raj Anand trying to fool? This is what we have seen in scores of movies before and that too, in movies that have been pretty good like very recently in 'Jab We Met'. The movie is stale food in old packing. There is nothing novel or spectacular about the movie. A few comic sequences are good though. Ranbir is good in the film. He is soon turning into the Star that will be the future of Bollywood. Priyanka is childish in the first half but as her character matures, she turns into this delightful performer. 'Especially after her 5th suicide attempt'. There is nothing Major wrong with the acting; it's the script and the direction that lets the movie down. The Cinematography is awesome. Ravi K Chandran shows why he is such a revered Cinematographer. The keen eye he has for the spectacular locations is awesome.The music of the movie is why i have decided to give it 2.5 stars rather than 1.5. Vishal-Shekhar have proved once again that they are one of the best and the most consistent composers of modern times. All the songs are good. But 'Tu Na Jane', 'Hairat' and 'Tujhe Bhula Diya' are simply mind-blowing. One of the best music score of this year. All in all, 'Anjaana Anjaani' is just another movie that revolves around the story that has been told several times in Hindi Cinema and adds no extra value to it. So if you have nothing better to do this weekend, as it is a dry day go and watch 'Anjaana Anjaani'. But, there are much better things to do in life, isn't it." 
" A Study in Stupidity","Lets see here- you have 2 strangers on a bridge wanting to commit suicide, for reasons when revealed later will make you wonder how the real people with really real and frightening problems are dealing with themselves! The strangers keep bumping into each other, cry and moan a bit about being serious about killing themselves, attempt ludicrous ways to off each other and surprise!... fail miserably, figure out the universe wont let them off so easy for being such bungling buffoons, make a weird pact to live for 20 odd days and fulfill their really lame and boring last wishes and meet again, hopefully to jump off the bridge again on 31st Dec.Kiara- Jilted (in her head at least) and heartbroken, is somehow always annoyingly cheerful, remembers to put on her perfect makeup, do her hair, color coordinate her preppy clothes, boozes and dances and sings to her vain lil hearts desire. And we are supposed to believe this chick is suicidal. Yeah. Right.Akshay- Bankrupt and selfish, is somehow shown to be quite insightful, a virgin (so we like him for being virtuous *groan*), always tucks his jeans inside his boots for reasons known only to him, falls for this pseudo-nutty broad cause, well cause he obviously has nothing better to do for these 20 days of wish fulfillment.Throw in some vague set of desi people who always bump into them at parties, are coastguards, doctors with some really good advice, friends and families who hover on the periphery of the vapid lives of our leads. Ho hum.Now the question you should be asking is where did these 2 get the money to blow at parties, booze, road trips and gas, gamble in casinos, hospital stays, hotel stays and food and endless cups of coffee etc. when the Hero is bankrupt and the Heroine gets laid off from her waitressing job. Last I heard living in NYC isn't cheap and Kiara through some miracle or Daddy's benevolence has a swanky place overlooking the city lights.I guess I was supposed to connect and feel empathy for these two star-crossed losers and smirk along with their quirks, instead I'm enraged that movie makers think the average audience is so thirsty for the glam quotient in our lil ordinary lives that watching 2 completely unlikeable characters on screen waste money and their lives, trying to figure out good enough reasons to live for by singing in clubs and driving down to Vegas, will fulfill some of our wishes. Puhlease.And finally, are we supposed to really believe that all the time these two evolutionary rejects spent in water, in NYC winters and they didn't ONCE catch hypothermia?! Gimme a break!" 
" Deja Vu","Some people never change. Indian Film makers' are a good example. In this industry most of the films are made only for commercial success. The makers give extra weightage to the star cast and publicity gimmicks.They copy rest from the films made in Hollywood. From locations to songs to scenes. It's high time that they should stop testing the audience's patience. Anjaana Anjaani is not an exception. Even a part of the main story looks very similar to our own Jab We Met. Directed by Siddharth Anand( of Salaam Namaste and Bachna ae Haseeno fame) the film stars Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra. According to the story, Ranbir and Priyanka are fed up of their lives and they meet while trying to commit suicide. Things go wrong and they land up in the hospital. They try again but they fail. They, then postpone their suicide date and focus on completing one task which, according to them, was left unaccomplished and was preventing them from dying. At first, Priyanka's job is to lift up Ranbir's mood and later on it's Ranbir's job to lift up Priyanka's mood. A few insatiable events make the movie even more predictable, but a few scenes do surprise you and manage to bring a smile( or laugh for few ) on the audience's face. In the end, there seems to be no need of reminding you what happens in the end.It would be good if Nadiadwala Grandsons stop producing films of this kind. They get highly predictable. It would be better if the makers put more focus on the script rather than on star cast and publicity gimmicks. Those movies bring more fame and money. Ranbir scores well in acting but everybody knows( including him ) he can do much much better than his performance in Anjaana Anjaani. His comic timing is good. His dance is good too. His physique does get a lot of wows from his female fans this time. Priyanka, look wise, is getting better minute by minute. She has a jaw-dropping looks in the movie. But again, we all know what Priyanka is capable of. She has given amazing performances in the recent past but she hasn't done justice to her role in the movie. Zayed Khan is unnoticeable as he has nothing to do in the movie. Direction, as mentioned above, could have been much much better. Cinematography is superb. Music by Vishal-Dadlani is good. Special mention for the song 'Hairat' sung by Lucky Ali which is exceptional. Supporting actors don't have anything to do in the movie but they carried off their part well. Editing was bad. The movie starts taking toll you in the second half. Dialogues at a few places are good and at a few places it is predictive and annoying.To conclude, I would just say, go for it if you are a Ranbir or/and a Priyanka fan and of course to see their chemistry in the movie( Only positive thing about the movie ).My Rating: 5/10Thanks & Regards" 
" Neal and Nikki (Tanisha,Uday) spin off","I slept through this.Beginning was wonderful very funny and witty.Priyanka Chopra was in good spirits.Ranbeer Kapoor looked like Abhishek Bachchan's younger brother.he is not so good here.Sidharth Anand directs this foolish script.its as awful as Salaam Namaste was.i don't know why our film makers go to US to shoot every second film.films like 3Idiots which showcase beauty of hill-side around Simla also show that their are breath taking locales here itself which remain untapped.Direction is horrible,see Priyanka Chopra's ward robe in the film ,its just such a drag really awful.that red dress she wears in the bar make her look like an ethnic behanji.this movie was so reminiscent of Neal & Nikki which starred Uday Chopra & Tanisha.Frankly that was so fresh this sucks like rotten tomatoes.Can't understand why producers spend such big money on making such awful stuff.Sajid Nadiadwal has ancient film line,could do something for film restoration.Nobody cares about our Indian classics.many films are already lost,most classic film negatives are in shambles.they can do better by investing their money in restoration of Indian classics.Government too does nothing .it does not even award people who work for restoring immortal classics.Movie like these are a waste of time and money." 
" Rubbish film...","this is my first review on IMDb.i registered to tell all of you how bad this movie is.there is no story whatsoever, most of the events in the movie are not justified, ranbir appears bored as if he is being forced to do this film although priyanka does well.there is some crude been-there-seen-that gay comedy which mostly falls flat. a couple of comic scenes do stand out for their originality. the rest of the movie is plain boring and a torture to sit through.the film is technically brilliant though, with outstanding camera-work once again by Mr. Ravi Chandran, excellent music by vishal-shekhar and beautiful foreign locales.i will go with a generous 4 out of 10 for this film only for the music and the cinematography. if u don't mind mental torture, go for this one!!" 
" Been there, done that..","I am sure my review won't be any different from the ones already posted. The movie starts with an unusually depressing premise for a bollywood style romance. It sounds promising but the director was probably instructed not to be too experimental because he quickly recovers himself and falls back into the routine of making a painfully boring love story. The first half has a few rare, blink and u miss it funny moments.The saddest part is that Priyanka and Ranbir actually have an excellent chemistry. So much scope and talent gone to waste! The hypocrisy also kills the mood. On one hand the protagonists are shown as modern , living on their own terms kind of characters who share an apartment , and when need arises , even a bed. Yet it becomes necessary for the director to force their virtuousness down our throats. Anyway the second half adds nothing to the story except some tears and then some more. Instead of making an entire movie on killing themselves they should have just made those two kill someone. Now that would have made an interesting story." 
" Priyanka rocks in this refreshing film","Priyanka is the showstealer of this movie. Her flawless and effortless acting make it an absolute pleasure to watch the character of Kiara go through a roller coaster of emotions from guilt, grief, and depression to jubilation, ecstasy, and love. Ranbir is also fantastic. He always gives a subtle but powerful performance. Both Priyanka and Ranbir's comic timing is right on the money, and the duo keep you in splits.The script, the backbone of the film, is terrific. I can't give too many details without giving away the story here. The entire process of making the film, from cinematography and direction to the most minute details such as depicting accurate weather across the US in winter, has been done very professionally. I personally really like how the film confronts the difficult times that the US is going through and, in a fun, light-hearted, and fully entertaining way, turns a devastating situation into a positive one. The entire soundtrack is awesome with fresh, soul-stirring music. The movie is a great, fun experience and has repeat value." 
" Totally ghisi-piti movie + corny as hell = waste of time.","There was about 30 mins of the movie in the middle that was interesting. The movie starts out weakly on a very bogus premise and ends in an even more pathetic fashion. Most of movie is super corny and almost unbearable to watch. It is completely predictable to the point that most of us who have watched such movies can predict what the next line and expression will be. Please, stop wasting time and money making crap like this. Sid, can you please try to make a movie in a different genre? Ranbir, can you stop picking loser scripts? Music was good but the movie is a total suck.4/10" 
" A Bollywood movie","A Bollywood movie revolving around only two major characters with its major scenes emphasizing only on their verbal conversations was surely a brave subject to choose for the director Siddharth Anand. But sadly this time too, he follows his same old path of inspired themes and copied scenes and comes out with a film which is tailor made only for the multiplex and college going audience.Right from the release of its first look, the film gave out few negative signals as its initial poster was straight away a copy of "An Education" (2009) with the genders changed, which was later pulled off due to its criticism. And today on its release, when the movie started on the screen, it's very first scene was exactly a copy of the French movie "Girl on the Bridge" (1999) with again the genders changed. The moment I saw this exactly similar execution of the scene as in the French film.90% of the audience would surely be not aware of this truth and neither would they be interested in knowing about it.Its main subject and theme is quite close to the original "Girl On The Bridge" on the whole (with also a reference to "The Bucket List").Anyway, ANJAANA ANJAANI couldn't impress me a lot as it was not based on an original thought and lacked a fine execution but you may like it if you are a fan of Priyanka and Ranbir." 
" Half Boring and Half Enjoyable -A Review by Myreviews","First 10 to 20 Minutes will make you to expect a different movie, then comes the most boring scenes in recent times. It will check your temper till interval. Post Interval have few good scenes which you might enjoy with your lover and then comes the OLD Hindi Melodrama with lot of tears and then a Happy ending with a Hug. The Narration is too slow for viewers to adjust in the first half, while second have good scope for a good love story like that of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge or Jab We Met. Whatever happening in the name of Comedy will make you feel to walk away from theater, are just torturing. Most of the scene all around are predictable and sometimes is too boring and lengthy.The Story is as old as Color movies in Hindi. But the movie can watched for the chemistry and the beauty of the top two actors Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra. Priyanka Chopra is the heart of the movie. Apart from good looking Ranbir Kapoor is not good enough for melodrama scenes. Two of the songs are also catchy and for a Musical film like this it should have given more importance to Songs. The Directed had tried to give a Hollywood touch in desi Love Fantasy story." 
" A perfect movie!","I never write reviews... in fact this is my first review. Hell! I signed up to write a review specially for this movie after reading all the other reviews.. Because this is a wonderful wonderful movie... I was too much bored and needed something to take me away from whatever's consuming my mind and I was totally absolutely blown away by this movie. It was a very unique story and I enjoyed my time thoroughly..Now I have read other reviews here about the story being similar to jab we met and etc. I think you don't need to re-invent the wheel to make a machine..!. I have seen jab we met and not for a sec i had the dejavu... It has its own story and its brilliantly presented. A perfect movie!" 
" Bollywood wishes to try something fresh but at the same time keeps sticking to the old formulas of love too.","A Bollywood movie revolving around only two major characters with its major scenes emphasizing only on their verbal conversations was surely a brave subject to choose for the director Siddharth Anand. But sadly this time too, he follows his same old path of inspired themes and copied scenes and comes out with a film which is tailor made only for the multiplex and college going audience.Right from the release of its first look, the film gave out few negative signals as its initial poster was straight away a copy of "An Education" (2009) with the genders changed, which was later pulled off due to its criticism. And today on its release, when the movie started on the screen, it's very first scene was exactly a copy of the French movie "Girl on the Bridge" (1999) with again the genders changed. The moment I saw this exactly similar execution of the scene as in the French film, my whole excitement to watch ANJAANA ANJAANI vanished into the thin air and I simply felt like cheated.I agree 90% of the audience would surely be not aware of this truth and neither would they be interested in knowing about it. But it does affect my watching experience of a movie when I see an entire sequence simply lifted from another source of World Cinema, without any kind of courtesy note or acknowledgment. So for me, ANJAANA ANJAANI failed from that very moment and it is simply made on the same formula of Siddharth Anand, which more or less remains dependent on ingredients taken from its VARIOUS SORUCES. Though after its opening lifted scene, the film moves on to different path talking about the relationship between the lead pair. But undeniably its main subject and theme is quite close to the original "Girl On The Bridge" on the whole (with also a reference to "The Bucket List").Moving ahead of this inspirational angle, ANJAANA ANJAANI does try to incorporate something fresh on the screen, with only the two lead characters in its script till the end. But the problem is that along with its novel theme, the director still keeps clinging to the ages old love formulas of Hindi Cinema, wherein the realization of true love comes towards the climax and the movie ends as usual with a rushing airport sequence. Now this raises a logical question that if we are intelligent enough to get inspired from such beautiful masterpieces made in the other parts of the world, then why we keep on adding our own rotten and overused formulas into it which totally ruin an otherwise good project in the end. The process simply takes away the beauty of the subject and results in a poor project in comparison to its worth watching original.On a positive note, ANJAANA ANJAANI has surely got some original entertaining moments showcasing few bold discussions going on between the couple. But these moments are not consistent throughout the movie and there are several dull moments too which spoil the spirit of the movie as a whole. The second half is a bit lengthy and should have been edited severely to leave a more solid impact on the viewers.Musically, the film has only two tracks which score above the rest and as I felt the background music was more enjoyable then the whole soundtrack. Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's song has now become a must for every good budget movie irrespective of the fact that whether his voice suits on any character in the film or not. But still he somehow manages to score in his most of the tracks, which is remarkable as an artist. Cinematography is one of those rare aces in the movie along with its eye catching costume designing.Collectively, ANJAANA ANJAANI can only be watched for Priyanka and Ranbir alone as they remain the soul of the film, with their brilliant, realistic performances of the Losers. The first half certainly is more entertaining than the second having the few worth watching moments for the youth. Both Priyanka and Ranbir once again prove their mettle with this movie and confidently declare that they can easily carry off a project on their shoulders alone without the help of any major supporting cast. But in absence of an adequate, strong and emotional script, their performances unfortunately just remain floating on the surface. As a surprise package, Zyed Khan is also there acting seriously in some scenes along with Priyanka.However, the film once again made me think that when the directors choose an inspired subject for their films or when they shoot an exactly similar sequence, secretly taken from another source, then do they inform this truth to their leading stars or they keep them in dark forever?Anyway, ANJAANA ANJAANI couldn't impress me a lot as it was not based on an original thought and lacked a fine execution but you may like it if you are a fan of Priyanka and Ranbir." 
" Fantastic Movie","I admit this movie may not be everybody's cup of tea but I thought it was brilliant. If your looking for your usual bollywood action and transatlantic sing songs look away because the only action this movie contains was 'lip action' and all the songs are shot in the same country. There weren't even that many costume changes in the songs. Sorry to disappoint, but 'bollywood is moving on' and this movie represents the previous statement greatly. I thought Ranbir was a moderate to good actor before I saw this movie but now I have realised that he has a kind of 'naturalness' to his acting in the sense that it is not too forced and that he is a minimalist actor, like actors from the 60's or 70's era. Priyanka, an unmistakable performance as usual." 
" Awesome","this was the best movie i have ever seen. Kiara was at her best. Akash was also very good in the movie. i enjoyed it a lot. Priyanka is my favorite. She proved it again. Script was also good but not that much i expected. Director has done it very smoothly. Songs were good. I have enjoyed the movie from the very first seen.Anjaana Anjaani is a Hindi film directed by Siddharth Anand, starring Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Zayed Khan. The film is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala under his Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment Pvt. Ltd banner and Sharan Kapoor under his IBC Motion Pictures banner. The film's music has been composed by Vishal-Shekhar, who have composed the music for all of Siddharth's three films in the past. The cinematography is handled By Ravi K. Chandran. Anjaana Anjaani was scheduled to release on 24 September, then it was postponed to 1 October 2010." 
" Anjaana Anjaani, D√©ja-vu?","Few stand outs from this mushy romantic parable directed by Siddarth Anand. "Confusion is the only med for confusion", "Storytellers do not freeze in sub-zero waters", "Blush is better than ram-pyari with free money, clothes, gas and aamir-all-is- well-sense", "Love travels faster than any science" and many more whims.Diverse characters ‚Äì heart-broken in their own ways - witness each other while ridiculing themselves! PC is heart-broken after losing trust in her infidel lover, while RK is struck with misfortune as his overambitious stunts crash with the stock market and dissolve his firm leaving his co-workers / friends distraught. While the movie starts on a negative note, with the 2 trying to commit suicide, the script moves naturally with the 2 teaming up in their pursuit of death. Unfolding memories, as they confront each other, help them learn and appreciate the optimism of life. The story moves to the obvious, fallin' in love, which changes the genre of the movie to emotional atyachar. And as it happened in KHNH, Love Aajkal and Hum Tum, the Mungeri Lals' realize their feeling for each other after they are miles apart. Of course, they did not commit suicide on Dec 31 ‚Äì as they had initially planned ‚Äì but ended up confessing their love in sub-zero waters at 12 midnight! They eventually commit suicide by getting married.The amateurish direction brought out scenes that lacked finishing, e.g. 1. Can't you wrap the cling film starting from nose-down instead? 2. In a random desert, how can you walk directly to your stolen car ‚Äì GPS tech, coincidence,¬Ö? 3. The fuming radiator just needs fresh air, few prayers and 'Love', to cool off!?None of the songs were script-worthy, and definitely crowded the script. PC could have done better as Kiara, considering her natural buoyant attitude. However, the script convincingly brings out the entertaining chemistry between them, thanks to RK's smooth acting and personification of Akash.There are a few good messages, however. As you try running away from life you realize how exciting it becomes. At the same time, the proximity to death makes it easy to live life as there's no tomorrow. Philosophical, isn't it?" 
" MOST Disastrous MOVIE OF THE YEAR","With high hopes and expectations, as me n my friends entered the theater to watch the movie,we were glad that we got the ticket in-spite of being house-full.. and believe me that was a mistake.. in the first fifteen minutes only the film starts irritating you and you will wish to go out of the hall. with a bunchful of overacting by priyanka and ranbir, the film irritates you even further.. don't know what the director siddharth anand wanted to show in this film as he completely failed to connect to the audiences.. he has not even being successful in entertaining in even one of the scene of the movie.. the movie gets stuck,and starts getting on to your head.. there is nothing much to be said about the movie as it is a complete disaster.. My suggestion... don't go to watch this film,rather enjoy India Australia stunning series sitting at home,and watch Indians doing their best at the commonwealth games which is being conducted so beautifully in Delhi..."
