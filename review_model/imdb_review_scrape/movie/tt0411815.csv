" Fun Action movie","Since there were no reviews on this movie - I figured I would have a comment. This movie was a lot better than I expected. There were too many songs, and none of them any good, however the fight scenes were better than any I have seen in a bollywood movie. Abhishek really looks like he can kick a lotta ass. It was entertaining and is definitely worth a watch. The movie is about a guy (Abhishek Bachchan) who comes to Delhi to go to school, he meets a girl and falls in love. The problem is that the girl has a crazy mob boss brother, who cut the hands of the last guy who liked his sister. And now the goons are after Abhishek, and if he is not careful he will lose his limbs or his life." 
" so much like Hong Kong films","I don't know if anyone else who has watched Hong Kong cinema agrees with me but this film is very much like the action films that come out every year in Hong Kong. From the storyline and plot right down to the action scenes and even comical scenes, there are just so many similarities. The only differences of course are that it it is in Hindi and it contains musical scenes, which Hong Kong films sadly do not have. Even though Abhishek will probably not come down as Jackie Chan, this film is worth watching if you like action films with kung fu fighting or if you are curious to know what experiments the directors in Bollywood are always up to." 
" Cute Bhoomika is the only Saving Grace","Storyline: If at all there was a story, I could write about storyline. The movie has the same old formula where College goers Siddharth (Abhishek Bacchhan) and Jahnavi (Bhoomika) fall in love at first sight and Jahnavi's evil brother Ganpat (Mahesh Manjerekar) will go to any length to prevent any evil eye on his sister. I will leave it here since anyone can predict the rest of the story.Comment: Pathetic Movie. If you feel that money and time have no worth, you can watch it in a movie hall. If you want to save money and have lots of time to spare, you can watch it on a VCD. Watching it on a VCD can spare you of the trouble of bearing through all the scenes. At least you can forward some of them.Abhishek Bacchhan has the same look and feel as in all his movies. He hasn't improved much. Bhoomika is surely cute/sweet. She looks good with a bindi and her hair open. As far as acting is concerned, it's fairly average. Mahesh Manjerekar has, among the other actors, performed relatively well. Actually, the story is so very predictable that you wouldn't want to appreciate anybody's performances.As far as comedy is concerned, Vijay Raaz has overacted in his roles. Rather than blaming him, it is better to blame the story writer, dialogue writer and the director. Music is listless except the title song "zara zara". In this song, it seems as if AB Jr and Bhoomika are competing for the "worst dancer" award!! Warning: Don't watch it in a movie hall. You don't get a chance to forward the scenes that you don't like." 
" run is average","This movie was not too bad but it was too long to sit through. I really can't imagine AB Jr running around like crazy after a girl. After seeing Dhoom and this movie, I think AB JR is better off as Jai in Dhoom. Boomika is nice and sweet. This movie reminded me of Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage. The three main characters (the boy, girl and the brother) were parallel. This movie is a bit more stand-able because Boomika does not hyperventilate. She is actually quite brave compared to Amisha. I guess that is just Amisha's trade mark. This brother was not as crazy as the one is AMALL. The comedy was a bit too much, I agree. The songs were okay but a bit too long. Overall, I recommend that you borrow this movie rather than buying it because it is not worth the money. Even if you are AB Jr's fan or Boomika's. I sure they have done much better movies." 
" "Run" away from this movie!","Okay, I'm convinced now. If Abhishek is in a movie, it's going to be a disaster. And what's up with Sridevi? Why does she make such trashy movies? How many times have I seen this story? It's so old! Two lovers caught between unwilling families. Well, I won't say that the title is a misnomer. The whole movie is just Abhishek, Bhumika, their families, and some other random people running all over the place, yelling, and fighting. This random supporting actor takes up like half of the movie with his absolutely pathetic, mindless humor. It is an insult to the word "humor" to call it so, but a sad attempt at that it was. The only reprieve from this awful movie were the songs in which Abhishek was looking idiotic." 
" Run run run","Abhishek's films pre DHOOM flopped badly in fact like Sr Bachchan Abhishek too had 3 and 1/2 years flops and flopsRUN is another addition to the list the film is a remake of south RUN directed by the same director JEEVA The film is crap Same story done to death Same romance first half boring and the forced comedy makes you puke second half is also nothing out of the worldSome stunts are good but some are terrible especially the last oneDirection by JEEVA is bad Music is goodAmongst actors Abhishek does well in his role which is too stereotype Bhumika is ordinary Mahesh Manjerekar does his part well Goga Kapoor is okay Amongst rest Ayesha Jhulka and Mukesh Rishi are okay"
