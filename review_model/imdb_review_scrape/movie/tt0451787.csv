" Flawless Salman!","Kyon Ki is known to be one of the best emotional performances given by Salman Khan after films like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Tere Naam. The film might be a remake but the execution here is perfect and the performances by the lead cast is brilliant.Salman Khan is flawless in each and every scene, one of his best performances till date. Rimi Sen is excellent in her short role. Kareena Kapoor gives a decent performance. Jackie and Om Puri are very good. This is one of the few movies during which you get tears in your eyes while watching and the ending will almost make you cry.All in all I would recommend every one to watch this movie and if you are a Salman Khan fan and you haven't seen it, you have missed one of his best performances..10/10" 
" Really Good Film","When watching this film, I thought the story and the songs were really nice and would be a film I would definitely recommend to anyone. It was really sad as well. I liked the acting and the actors as well. I also liked the book within the film. I would also say that this film really did show off Salman Khans great acting skills and comedic skills as well. In terms of Rimi Sen Kareena Kapoor, i would say Kareena and Salman seemed to go well, I would like to see them again together in another film. This is a film which i would watch again. I think the director did a really good job and should continue making films like this. I give this film 8.5 out of 10." 
" Kyon Ki...its special and of course Salman Khan!","Kyon Ki is one of the most-awaited films for Salman Khan and in the BO market for the second half of 2005. By looking at the promos, people are expecting to see a film that will be highly on emotions. And since its Diwali/Eid, people want to see comedy and not a serious film like Kyon Ki. However, since I have been such a Salman Khan fan since Maine Pyar Kiya, and judging by the promos from the film, I am expecting him to deliver an amazing performance after Tere Naam. So despite being a serious film, the question is, IS KYON KI WORTH THE WATCH? The answer is a resounding YES, go and watch it.SCENES THAT STOOD OUT The scene where Salman Khan gets admitted in the hospital - Somescenes in the mental institution - Scene where Salman Khan explains the significance of music - Rimi Sen death - Salman Khan and Om Puri confrontations - Jackie Shroff final speech to Om Puri - Heart-rending climaxHimesh Reshammiya is simply good, not better than Tere Naam. The soundtrack should finish this year as one of the best selling album of 2005, probably the best. Songs like "Kyon Ki Itna", "Dil Keh Raha Hai", "Aa Jeene Ek Pal", and "Jhakte Mare" are placed well and are well-tuned. Only song that didn't have much impact was "Dil Ke Badle" as it was placed bad in the movie. I felt that Priyadarshan direction was good at places, but it could've been better. Since this was like a serious film, I was expecting the same Priyadarshan from Virasat and Gardish, and for that, I was kind of disappointed. However, to keep in the mood of film, I was little happy with Priyadarshan in a way because he had comedy, action and sad scenes in Kyon Ki. However, the direction should have been more hard-hitting like Gardish, and some of the scenes do drag a lot. Suneil Shetty was wasted. Kareena Kapoor has done a great job. It's good to see her in a different role. Her new look is very well and simple. She is bound to win come accolades from her performance. Her ending scene will be a shock.Rimi Sen plays her part okay, but not that good.However, she does make an impact.Om Puri was great as strict father and the mean doctor who believes that brutal force are the ways to cure an ailing patient. You will hate him for what he did at the ending.Jackie Shroff was simply good in Kyon Ki, might earn him a nomination for best supporting actor. He played his scenes excellent and his dialogue delivery was good. His final scene was simply great.HOWEVER, THE SHOW-STEALER WAS NONE OTHER THAN SALMAN KHAN. Salman played his role superbly; you have to see it to believe it. If he succeeds a good way when seeing his story with Rimi Sen, then he was excellent as the patient in the mental institution. Salman Khan was the lifeline of Kyon Ki, without him, Kyon Ki would have fallen flat down. Your heart will go for Salman Khan at the ending, as it was very sad. Salman Khan should earn a nomination for this performance, and probably should win the Critics Actor award for it. His fan-following should increase once more for this super performance. His performance should finish off as one of the best of 2005. Screenplay was a complete letdown in my opinion. Some scenes didn't make sense. Salman Khan, once he recovered, he instantly falls in love with Kareena and then they sing a song, it was kind of stupid. Cinematography was excellent, they managed to capture Romania.Background was good.Dialogues were very good.Editing could've been better.Seriously, go and watch Kyon Ki which is a mature and sensitive product from Priyadarshan. It may have not taken a big opening thanks to its lame promos and being calls as an "Emotional film", however Kyon Ki doesn't disappoint. However, the movie does have its flaws, but critics like Taran always writes from a BO point of view, and hope he gets the shock of his live when Kyon Ki succeeds. Come on, if a guy like Mr. Jha can write a good review for Kyon Ki, then you should watch it. And look at it, Kyon Ki collections increases and it is steady right now. And thanks to Salman Khan huge star-power (since he is having such an amazing year), and that his performance is hugely appreciated, people hopefully will support their hero and see a superb performance from Salman Khan. There is a time to watch entertainment cinema and there is a time to watch serious/intelligent cinema like Kyon Ki. I can bet that Kyon Ki is a much better film than Garam Masala and Shaadi No.1 combined together. Well, since it's Diwali/Eid, go and watch Kyon Ki for its performance (esp. Salman Khan) and good soundtrack. I'm sure you won't feel that disappointed. Kyon Ki is one of the best films of 2005, simply put thanks to its different theme.8/10" 
" kyon Ki . .","I thought this movie was decent enough to watch once and did not think to much of the concept, until very recently I saw one flew over the cuckoo's net (1975) and it made me feel as if i had been ripped off, i thought why is it that all new Hindi movie's have to be based off of old Hollywood movies or south movies (with few exceptions ex. Vivah, which is an amazing movie). everything in this movie is the same as that movie except for the girl factor or as we can call it the bollywood factor, overall if you're watching this movie keep in mind that it is one of those bollywood movies that is plagiarized so all in all if you like the story don't credit priyadarshan and if you hate it don't blame priyadarshan either, also the music is good in the movie and worth listening too." 
" # 36","Salam.... I just finished watching this amazing movie. I liked Salman Khan's performance specially when he shed a tear in the scene with Jacki Shroff after surgery, i cried with him and i couldn't stop after Karina's scene on the wheel chair with the same number 36 !! What a wonderful story .. yeah it's really the fate.Jackie Shroff offered very fit role for him, i cant forget the shine of his eyes when they were full of tears in the office of Dr.Khurana after he knew who Anand is.Rimi Sen played her role that full of life so well,she excited me every time she plays a trick on Anand.Om Puri was convincing to the extent that make you hate him and that's consider as a good advantage in acting.Finally the special appearance of Sunil Shetty in the movie was nice.That's all i have.... Thank you :)" 
" For: Kareena & Romania; Against: Melodrama & Poor chemistry","Plot Outline: Anand (Salman) is admitted to an asylum where Dr. Tanvi (Kareena), her father (Om Puri) & Dr. Sunil (Jackie Shroff) are psychiatrists. Tanvi learns of Anand's tragic past of his lover Maya's (Rimi Sen) death and the murder charge on him. Whilst helping his recovery, the two fall in love against the wishes of her father. The Official Website calls it "A passionate love story, twisted by fate at its imaginative best".Comment: The story traces its lineage to Hollywood's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' which Priyadarshan has portrayed in 'Thalavattam' (Malayalam) and 'Kyon Ki'. Although some called it a comedy, I would call it a tragedy. Jokes involving the mentally challenged are history. The melodramatic climax actually leaves the viewer nauseating. Character development is poor with lead pair's love and chemistry hardly noticeable.Salman is bearable and Kareena though plump looks adorable in sarees. Om Purie, Jackie Shroff and Rimi are passable. Sunil Shetty's cameo was avoidable. Of the songs, 'Kyon ki itna pyar' and 'Dil Keh Raha Hai' are worthy. Priyadarshan could rather stick to comedies like Hungama or Garam Masala for better BO success.Rating: 4/10" 
" Waych yhe original instead","Though the Priyadarshan directed KYON KI is a good movie (what i partically loved was the unconventional ending, Salman Khan's performance and of course Rimmi), if you want to see the difference between a good movie and an absolute classic than watch the original instead. Though Priyadarshan denied his film being a remake, it actually is. This movie is a remake of one of the three black and white movies Rajesh Khanna made in his career. I am talking about the Hemant Kumar produced and Asit Sen directed film KHAMOSHI. This film starred Rajesh Khanna, Dharmenra, Waheeda Rehman and Devan Varma. Music was by Hemant Kumar and the film has two great evergreen songs : WOH SHAAM KUCH AJEEB THI (by Kishore Kumar) and TUM PUKARLO (by hemant Kumar). Even the ending (though not a happy ending here either) is far better and more realistic then Kyon Ki." 
" Utterly Regressive","It can be claimed that this is not a usual entertaining film but whether it is a tragic film or a stupid, regressive film is for you to decide looking at some of these facts shown in the film- Throughout the film mentally challenged people are addressed in most derogatory language. (common word to address them is " Paagal") There is a head of the Sanctorium who tortures his patient by giving them electric shocks to settle his personal scores is quite demeaning, disgraceful and irresponsible portrayal. If that is not enough, he goes to the extent of conducting unnecessary surgeries on his most hated patients in order to make their living even worse and yet manages to hold his position in the Sanctorium without being checked by anybody. How come this is possible in today's age? Isn't it set a bad example? The Sanctorium is decked up with glass sheets all over so that whenever any patient gets restless (a normal thing at such places) he can have an easy access to break them one by one. If he gets more restless security guards starts beating him up with sticks. The film has character of a "normal" girl who when want to play a prank on his lover, starts driving a car recklessly on the roads without having any safety regard for pedestrians. Are such people considered normal by any standards? No wonder when she dies, she did not evoke any empathy. The character of Kareena Kapoor is surprisingly unconvincing, as she did not fight for her love at all. The film is not just bad but is plain unbearable and cruel. In such film, you cannot see anything beyond this even if for a change there are some picturesque locations captured vividly by cinematographer Tirru, which is a trademark of most of Priyan's films. A couple of melodious songs also uplift the general tone of the film. Lastly, if your argument about films still is that of an artistic expression and it should not to be taken seriously as in commercial Hindi films things are shown like that since ages then I am sorry to say indifferent attitude and insensitivity brought this type of apathy and there is no point in arguing further on this. How come then we expect the things to change and to bring the right awareness? The film is rightly condemned by the psychiatrist community. My question to the audience is who should actually be send to asylum for showing such shoddy picture of the homes for mentally challenged ones?" 
" Salman plays a mental guy. hold on haven't we seen this in an another movie?","what a load of cods wallop salman khan plays a pagal who jackie shroff and kareenakapoor try to make OK. kareena's father owns the hosp and is very strict. so cue the flash backs and we find out that salman was a lover who pursues and marries a girl he fell in love with. however after marriage his wife plays a few pranks on him and one moment he thinks she's playing a prank on him by saying she cant swim. salman thinks she's lying and throws her in the pool, only to return 5 mins after to find her dead. so he goes mental. as they try to get salman better kareena, who's marriage is fixed to a lame guest appearance by sunil shetty, falls in love with salman... what will happen shock horror we cant ever predict that her dad will disapprove.OK as u can tell i thought the film was crap. real crap. the ending surprised me but cause it was unconventional and i think pointless.songs were nothing special and the performances are poor. what also bugged me was that the subtitles were SO off. three scene ahead...avoid" 
" Is this movie a poor adaption of one flew over the cuckoo's nest????","No doubt, This is one of the best performance of SALMAN KHAN !! But the story seems illogical to me. other actors were good specially Jackie shroff. karina's performance could have been better. Some of the scenes were very familiar to another movie called " One flew over the cuckoo's nest".Above all , a must watch movie for SALMAN lovers." 
" Fantastic Drama","The less known about the plot the better for this movie. In brief, Anand (Salman Khan) is admitted to a mental hospital in a childlike state where he is treated by three doctors, Tanvi (Kareena Kapoor), Sunil (Jackie Shroff), and Dr. Khurana (Om Puri). His past is shown in flashback, and Rimi Sen plays Maya, Anand's love interest.This fantastic drama is funny, touching, and sometimes shocking. Khan plays the childlike Anand excellently. Shroff and Puri give wonderful, believable performances. Kapoor is a bit stiff at times, but generally convincing. The music is good, with some lovely lyrics. Kapoor's costumes are beautiful. The plot is gripping, keeping the viewer interested throughout. Overall, it is a movie I would universally recommend." 
" Stellar cast tries very hard to salvage a bad script!","There were several problems with this film. But let me just say that I am giving it a 9 out of 10 for the acting. As much as I hate Salman Khan as an actor and person, he was good in this role in which he plays a mental patience who isn't really crazy just in denial. He doesn't stereotype the role and that was great! Kareena Kapoor haunts as the doctor who eventually falls in love with him and loses herself in the wake of her love for him. Jackie Shroff and OM Puri round out the cast with strong supporting and impeccable performances as family friend and father of the afore mentioned protagonists respectively. Rimii Sen and Suniel Shetty are also great in friendly appearances but the script was in a world of its own. There was just too much going on for one film!! It was insane! The script was truly insane! I mean, in one film the story of the life of Salman Khan and his wife is told, the story of Kareena Kapoor and her potential hubby is told, the story of the mental patients is told, the story of Jackie Schroff is told, the story of Salman and Kareena is told, I mean it was too much for one film. It was like the editor did not do their job or maybe there was no editor for the film. Like I read in a previous review by another poster, and he said that he is surprised the audience did not go mental watching this film and that's so funny but you have to be prepared for this film or you will go insane watching it. BRACE YOURSELF! It's the type of film you would love to hate, but just can't find the hate. Salman Khan makes you fall in love with him and Kareena Kapoor gives the most heartbreaking performance of her career second only to her turn in Asoka." 
" Read and see","Really Nice. Some times tears come into the eyes. Rimi acts so well and Salman and Kareena are cute. I can recommend this film to anyone without doubt. Actually a good film I've seen. Songs are very nice especially Jhakta Mare, Kyon Ki Itna Pyaar and Dil Ke Badle.Dil eh Raha Hai isn't strong enough. The man is mad and the doctor is very cruel. The story of the movie is admirable but some parts or scenes on the film is quite not admirable. Everything is mixed up like Romance, Family, Cruelty. A successful film.Acting is superb but goes down in some parts.Priyadarshan has done well. Again Its all sad I can give 8 stars for this movie" 
" Crap...","I did not have any expectations of this movie, and I am very glad I did not anticipate about this movie or contribute financially the first part of the movie moves very slow and doesn't seem to progress thus there is not much of a plot apart from Salman being thrown into a mental home where so called 'patients' that require special treatments are treated, if possible worse than animals with the occasional electric shocks when they 'misbehave'. As soon as Kareena finds about Salman's ludicrous love story, (Which involves throwing his fiancée in a pool and then leaving her and come back to see her dead) and in no time at all when he falls down some hill, he is normal again? This is an insult to our intelligence! In contrast to the slow beginning, the ending of the movie was a rushed 'quick fit' and decide to have a 'tragic' ending by Salman being murdered and Kareena being put into the same mental home. The time it took for all this to happen5 minutes, which in a way was good as I could not endure it any longer so if you are thinking about watching this movie go and watch some paint dry instead. Ps: The one 2 points are dedicated to the average performance by Salman Khan." 
" Bad","This movie is base on a mad man SALMAN KHAN who kill his girl friend RIMI SEN and sent to the metal house. In there there is a Doctor JACKIE SHORROF who was same village as Salman was and he became doctor by salman father so he get very emotional for him. In there there was a lady doctor Kareena Kapoor who was helping him to get better and she started falling love with salman character but Kareena has a fiancé Suil shetty and her farther OM PURI is really curl doctor.i don't like the movie because is has a very sad ending such Tere naam just make is oppised and the songs is really nice my favorite song is Dill keh raha hai.if u will watch this movie u will waste your money." 
" This is an copy of One flew over the cuckoos nest!!!","all i will say that this movie is the copy of:One flew over the Cuckoo's nest Salman Khan--- Jack Nicholson Om Puri--- Nurse Ratchet Jackie Shroff--- American Indian Dudecheck out one flew over the cuckoos nest... it is a great movie!Salman Khan did a great job in this moviefor once, Kareena Kapoor did great in the movie as well.The only reason people rate this bad is because either they have not seen One flew over the Cuckoos nest or they just love happy endings. Don't get me wrong, i like a happy ending better than a sad ending especially when it is 2 a.m. when your watching it. Great copy of a American Classic!"
