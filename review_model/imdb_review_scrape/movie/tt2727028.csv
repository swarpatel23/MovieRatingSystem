" Total Siyapaa indeed","Loosely based on the Spanish rom-com 'Seres Queridos' ('Only Human') in which a Palestinian boy meets his Jewish girlfriend's family, Total Siyapaa explores the India-Pakistan cultural divide through the relationship of Aman (Ali Zafar) and Asha (Yami Gautam), set in London. Everything in their relationship is picture perfect, till Asha invites Aman to meet her family over dinner. Asha's family goes crazy when they come to know that Aman is a Pakistani. The chaos begins and Aman finds himself in nightmare, which just doesn't seem to be ending!The first half of the movie is a breezy comedy of errors, with some sharp dialogues and funny situations. But second half goes on an entirely different tangent that doesn't tie in with the first half. After a while, the screenplay seems super stretched, with too many pointless sub-plots. Even when the movie is less than two hours one wishes that at least 15 minutes more were edited. Also other than a few dialogues that evoke a hearty laugh rest just fail to make any impact. Performance wise, Kiron Kher steals the show, playing the loud Punjabi paranoid mother with perfect comic timing, barring a few scenes where she overacts Ali Zafar plays himself, a musician from Pakistan, offering nothing new in his poker face type of performance. He still has the natural charm and is likable as the confused, ill-fated Pakistani boyfriend stuck in a crazy situation. Yami Gautam's character, as the Indian Hindu love interest, was poorly written and she did not have much scope to perform. Also, there was no chemistry between Ali and Yami. On the other hand, watching the interactions between Zafar (the damaad) and Kher (the mother-in-law-to- be) together on screen were an absolute delight. Anupam Kher is completely wasted and it is sad to see an actor of his talent play a silly, cameo- ish role in Total Siyapaa. New-find Sara Khan comes across seductive. Other actors were plain and bland.Anupam Kher and his real life wife Kiron Kher play the on screen couple for the first time and their chemistry and pairing has not been properly exploited in the movie. Total Siyapaa has a very telefilm or theatric look and feel and director Eeshwar Nivas has made the entire flick in essentially three sets and the entire cast has donned one outfit throughout. Outcome of a low budget more then the script's demand, because the artists are also badly styled. Music is strictly average and not very memorable - although 'Palat meri jaan' is enjoyable and compliments the plot.Total Siyapaa is really a major chaos. Overall, the best moments from Total Siyapaa were already shown in the snappy promos and a very interesting concept is churned out as strictly average movie lacking charm, spark and humor." 
" Total Waste","When I first caught the preview of this film "Total Siyappa", it seemed a fun and entertaining film, the concept was new, the songs were good and there was a good amount of humor and romance. But after spending or I should say wasting 1hour 45mins on this movie, I can't find a single reason to appreciate this movie, the script was idiotic, didn't expect that, since Neeraj Pandey was associated with this movie. The film has no story at all, some Scattered events sewed together, which were supposed to make sense, but they seldom do. The movie progresses very slowly and by the second Half it gets super boring and starts to fall apart. The acting was average, Ali Zafar tried but doesn't actually click, Yami Gautam was all smiles and nothing else, only Kiron Kher did something good in acting department rest were all were bland. In the second half Anupam Kher appears but I don't have a single clue What he was doing in the movie, it's rather annoying to see such a talented actor's potential not utilized.The movie also tried to tackle the India-Pakistan issue, but it all seemed pointless, at the conclusion, I would say it's a "total" waste of time and money." 
" Total Siyapaa is a light-hearted romantic comedy.","Ali Zafar as Aman, the male lead of the movie is cute as a Pakistani boy friend who is in London to meet his Punjabi girl friend Asha's (Yami Gautam) family to seek their permission for the marriage. When the movie begins, it does give a feeling that movie is going to be a laughter riot but somewhere it gets stretched. Siyapaa (Chaos) begins the moment Aman comes out of the airport. Siyapaa only increases as Aman reaches Asha's family and the family discovers that he is Pakistani. A series of events follow one after another. Kirron Kher as Asha's mother is loud, expressive and very vocal. Her anxiety as a mother is believable. Grandfather (Vishwa Badola) does give some funny shots when he keeps moving around the house. Anupam Kher as Asha's father is having an extended cameo role in the movie, I wish his role could have been redefined with more funny moments. An actor of such a great caliber and comic timings seemed underutilized. Asha's sister Jia (Sara) is good in her carefree attitude. The dance sequence by Jia and Aman on table-top is captivating and full of energy. The Anti-Pakistani brother of Asha (Anuj Pandit) is natural in his performance. Director E Niwas along with Neeraj Pandey (Story / Screenplay) have sensitively handled India Vs. Pakistan issue in a very light-hearted manner. A scene is to be mentioned where a coin is flipped to decide who will beat up an Englishman first – the Indians or Pakistanis, one doesn't get to see the coin; the coin is tossed and it is in the air and the very next moment Englishman is beaten up. Music by Ali Zafar is good. Palat Meri Jaan has been appreciated. Chal buleya, a sufi song is also very melodious.Total Siyapaa is fun to watch - with Ali Zafar amidst 'Total Chaos'." 
" Funny, but only in bits!","'Total Siyapaa' is funny, but only in bits! It has some hilarious moments, but they are limited only till its first-hour. A weak second-hour plays a spoilsport.'Total Siyapaa' Synopsis: Settled in London, Aman hopes to marry Asha, an Indian woman also based in London. He visits her parents' house to seek their permission to marry her. However, his plans to impress the family start failing when they discover that he is a Pakistani.'Total Siyapaa' begins superbly & the first-hour has some genuinely hilarious moments. The Hindu-Pakistani conflict works hugely. However, things go down in its second-hour. The pace drops & even the humor is clearly missing in this hour. In short, a winning first-hour gets effected due a to weak second. Neeraj Pandey's Screenplay gets it right in the first-hour, but lacks merits in the second-hour. E. Nivas's Direction is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent.Performance-Wise: Ali Zafar is likable. He enacts the caught-up protagonist nicely. Yami Gautam is charming. Kiron Kher is simply awesome. She emerges the real scene-stealer here! Sara Khan is credible. Anupam Kher is wasted.On the whole, 'Total Siyapaa' works, but only in till a point." 
" Disappointing!","Despite the giddy pace, it soon becomes clear that there's not enough of a story here, merely a string of gags. The thin plot is stretched out until it collapses under the weight of its contrivances, squandering a good cast, particularly Kirron Kher as the shrill Mummyji. Such a shame that the film's central conflict evaporates conveniently and unconvincingly in a hurried, all-too-neat finale. Funny, but in a pedestrian sort of way. While the promos of the film prepare you for a laugh-riot, what unfurls on screen doesn't keep you in splits through and through. Initially, yes, the humor works, especially when Ali meets his prospective mother-in-law Kirron Kher, but thereafter, a few sporadic instances apart, several episodes fall flat. On the whole, TOTAL SIYAPAA appeals in bits and spurts. You expect a laugh-riot, but what comes across on screen is half-baked." 
" Sweet but slow Siyapaa","Director Mr. Eshwar Niwas work is just average. Idea is cute. Screenplay is OK but gags in the screenplay are good. Dialogues are impressive. Maximum humor comes out only due to very good dialogues. Credit goes to writer Neeraj Pandey. Length of this movie, which is 1.45 hours, is too short according to Hindi cinema. Even it drags at too many places. First half is good but second half is loose. There are lots of scenes which are abrupt, i.e Suddenly memory loss and again memory gain, both are pushed just to create humor. This track is boring and lengthy. They inform that grandfather hears loud but all talks to him in normal way. Even he is blind but he can target gun and play with knife! Track of Pakistani neighbour is also weak and pushed one. Performance wise Ali Zafer is very good. His voice modulation is amazing and it set the mood of scene very well. Yami Gautem is good. Kirran Kher is fine. Sara Khan as Jia Singh is OK. Anupam Kher is wasted. Music is OK. Total Siyapaa, tera pyar track is good." 
" A Film Against Its Own Genre. ♦ 23%","Because it chiefly talks about the poor international relationship between Pakistan & India. It makes fun of it; in every sequence, the lead couple debate as to why India & Pakistan is better in their own way. The comedy genre was lost somewhere in the middle.Ali Zafar should just stop appearing in films; he is a good musician, why not stay as is? Yami Gautami's second stint in Bollywood is below average. But this is not where the film goes wrong. The lead actresses's family is a weird lot, having a prejudice for everything not Punjabi.When thespians like Kirron & Anupam Kher act so badly, portraying characters that are not only half-baked but also illogical, you should get a fair idea where the film is moving. Then you have another hot- doll, which seems to be one the makers' daughter: flashing her figure all over the frame, flirting with her on-screen sister's fiancé simultaneously taking care of her over-smart child.The father of the family is missing. Instead of being serious and and trying to find him, you have the wife making fun of her spouse's habits, the daughter drunk-dancing on top of a table, the son getting in a fight with Pakistanis and then befriending them, etc..No script, poor direction, spontaneous dialogs, useless songs, no chemistry, poor editing and a very bad screenplay. The whole premise is so far from logic, I would've barfed if I would have stayed a minute longer in the theater. Who makes such movies? And I hear the producers of A Wednesday & Special Chabbis came together for this one. Well, terrible. Few humorous scenes made me chuckle 2-3 times, but that's it.BOTTOM LINE: Never have I seen such an idiotic movie with no single factor to consider that after it got over, I looked at my partner and our expressions matched perfectly: that of disgust." 
" MADDD siyapaa!!!","Picture this. The daughter of a family has a secret boyfriend whom she's about to introduce to the family. No big deal, right? But what if she is an Indian and he's a Pakistani? Picking on this pert premise screenwriter Neeraj Pandey does a special 69 on cross-border politics. Borderline tensions are defused to the point until we see just the ludicrous futility of cultural bickering. It's a delicious idea to build a plot around. Pandey derives inspiration from a Spanish film "Seres Queridos", in which the conflict between the Palestinian boy and his girlfriend's Jewish family was served in a feisty feast of farcical episodes, all meant to draw humour from the dysfunctional family's dysfunctionalism. In the Hindi adaptation Total Siyapaa, the Pakistani boy is utterly and delectably lost in his girlfriend's Punjabi home in London. Director Eeshwar Niwas, who had earlier adapted the ransom caper "Ruthless People" in a reasonably watchable film "Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega", uses London's nightscape as a beguiling backdrop to the Punjabi family's bickering. Ironically, the plot loses its liberal air once out on the streets. Anupam Kher's tryst with a British hooker is sadly unanchored. It's one evening in the family's history. The script brings out the eccentric characters and their whimsical ways with the kind of pleasure that a housewife experiences while serving up her husband's favourite dishes although she may not be too good at the cooking. A lot of the humour simply sags in soggy lumps. There is a distinctly 'European' flavour and fervour to the unravelling of the comic mode in the dysfunctional family's life. Ali Zafar as the bewildered Pakistani boyfriend and Kirron Kher as his scattered mother-in-law- to-be project a prowling predatoriness to their scenes together. They are a delight to watch when thrown together. I really wish there was more of Kirron Kher and Ali Zafar in the plot. The meat of the matter lies in the mater's time on screen with her to be 'damaad' (son-in-law). Yami Gautam as the giggly prim girlfriend is a sketchily written mediocre character with no dips and curves. I New-find Sara Khan as Yami's sister comes across as a far more seductive character. The role is tantalising and Sara plays with guts and vivacity the near-divorced single mother with a restless foot under the dining table. And for my money, Sara's tabletop dance with the distinctly diffident Ali is the film's highlight. Sadly by the time Sara's sexy jig comes along, the plot meanders in search of a combustive climax. The strenuous effort to Indianise a Spanish comedy begins to take its toll on the narrative when the dysfunctional family runs out of tricks to rivet us to their wackiness. The film comes to an inglorious halt with one of the character's stumbling home in a dazed condition, much in the same condition as the plot. But there is a lot that goes in its favour. The elegantly done-up cosy and eccentric atmosphere of a London home, for one. David Meadows' cinematography looks at London as home rather than a tourist destination. Sanjoy Chowdhury's background score reminds us that no matter how hard the characters scream, the music needn't get aggressive in support. The cast, as mentioned, largely does well for itself with Ali Zafar, Kirron Kher and Sara Khan leading the pack. Is it enough for two individuals from clashing cultures and countries to be in love? Love can be quite a bitch. "Total Siyapaa" is total madness. An audacious comedy that dares to poke fun at a border issue, the film is stylised and is attentively staged." 
" A Forceful Comedy Effort !!!!","One sentence to wrap up the whole film is " A genuine forceful effort to make people laugh (Only possible on Gun Point)". Ali Zafar's 4th Movie (2nd disaster in sequence) is out and finally the fans are disappointed again. The whole plot from start till the end was beyond apprehension. One feels tortured and painful while watching this so called comedy flick. The idea to shoot the movie in one night, one dress and one go is poorly conceived, weakly written, immaturely directed and childishly portrayed. The characters appear in a haphazard manner. The cast was quite limited. The scope remained narrow, dialogs highly unimpressive and acting substandard. The father of the heroine (Yami) is missing, brother fighting with Pakistani neighbor (without any good reason), sister is acting weird (crushing on Ali and at the same loving her husband and the mother is making a joke of her husband while he is missing. Ali Zafar should quit movies immediately and concentrate on his music. Acting is probably out of his league. Yami Gupta was not seen as fresh as she was (I mean it is an achievement to shoot the complete movie in only one dress without any definite reason). Kirron Kher was OK but Anupam Kher was not seen at all in the movie (invisible character) The idea of India Pakistan tussle among a love couple surely would have achieved a great success and a nice movie if conceived and directed with some sense. Such ventures only add frustration to the audience and adds another disappointment to the flop charts numbers in the Bollywood. I do not recommend this movie to watch even when you don't have anything to watch. A failure with two thumbs down !!!" 
" big time disappointment","well i had high hopes with this move i just love Ali zafar and yami and was expecting this movie to be super doooper hit, me n my four other mates went to watch this movie it start well like first 10 minutes n then we were trying to find out any funny scene to laugh there were few scenes but they weren't enough to make this movie watchable and the topic was just too good a thing between Pakistan and India and there could had been many many things that could had made this movie special but sorry to say Ali, yaami n anupam kher all good actors but there talent was wasted in this movie. ANUPAM KHER didn't said a single word in this movie?" 
" Total Timewaste","A Wednesday was a classic. Directed by Neeraj Pandey, who's not know for being prolific (the way RGV is, who can be excused his misdemeanors due to the qty?).Special 26, his follow-up, that took quite a few years to follow up, was a lesser work, but in comparison to most of the trash dished out by Bollywood, it was pretty decent.He's now put his name to a remake of a famous 2004 Spanish movie, that reads like a run-of-the-mill work on paper, but isn't it all in the treatment? I thought so, and bought tickets for 2 of us to watch it, missed it the first time, and ended up watching it recently, in a small screen multiplex.Not to put too fine a point on it, but it has to be one of the most appallingly bad movies I've watched in a long time. And that's including the pointless 'Gunday', 'GI Joe 2' and many more that litter this hall of fame. Reminded me a lot of another Indie that shoulda coulda been good, that came out a few years back - Buddha Mil gaya. This doesn't quite plumb those depths, but they sure tried to make it do so. Can't lay much of the blame on the acting though, since most of them are seasoned performers. I do question their choices, however, esp. both the Kher spouses'. The only thing it has going for it is a spunky performance of Sara Khan, and boy I wish it were enough. But the crapfest around her just reminds us that this ain't good even for an obscure TV run. Sadly though, with every pencil-pusher thinking he/she's a reviewer, and mandating 'taste' across the board, this is the kinda movie that surprises with its box-office, leading to a churn of others such as this at the multiplexes. Not for me, though, hopefully. 2014's first turkey. Watch at your own risk." 
" good family movie..i love yami gautam","Nice movie..funny reactions from ali zafar..
yami gautam is one of my favourite actresses" 
" Waste of Finances","Total Siyapaa- 2014 Director: Eeshwar NivasTotal Siyapaa' is funny, but only in bits! It has some hilarious moments, but they are limited only till its first-hour. The songs were good and there was a good amount of humor. There is not a single reason to appreciate this movie, the script was idiotic, didn't expect that, since Neeraj Pandey was associated with this movie. The film has no story at all, some Scattered events sewed together, which were supposed to make sense, but they seldom do.To be honesty I'm a huge fan of Ali Zafar but I was astonished to see the movie that what on Earth made him do this film. No proper plot and story, poor direction. Not recommended." 
" Wastage of time","Total Siyapaa is Total wastage of time, a torture to watch because it was so boring and slow moving.It has been a Massive disappointment. The only face saving is the last song at credits. Ali Zafar's 'Tere bin Laden' was funny and well executed. Total Siyapaa on the other hand is not. It is sad because it could have been a good movie, however, I constantly had the feeling of a movie made with no real effort put in to it, poor direction, overacting and bad dialog with even worse delivery. Rest of the family felt the same also. Save yourself, watch something else." 
" too long , less content , not funny , waste of time","the only thing that kept me awake was cute actress . The plot is little for the hours devoted in showcasing it . some scenes are awkward to watch with family. Yami gautam looks wonderful in all scenes . Characters behave exaggeratedly . no laughing moment other than those shown in its advertisement . nothing seems logical . emotions do not explain the outcome . Some TV serials are far more interesting than this , at least they end sooner. the turn of events is unexplained . Movie is low budget as things happen inside closed spaces .Some scenes are interesting but their presentation does not bring out the inner sarcasm ." 
" Great watch for serious movie goers!","This review doesn't contain spoilers about the actual story of the film:OK, so I've seen a few bad reviews of the film so I'd just like to highlight what type of people SHOULD AVOID this film:People who want to watch a blossoming love story like all the others 1000s in the past. i.e. boy meets girl.People who want to watch a triangle love story i.e. who will get the hero/heroine. People who want to see weak female characters whose only part is to provide masala, act as the perfect damsel in distress who the hero rescues, and then wait for the villain to threaten to rape/harm her if the hero doesn't comply.People who are impressed/want over the top fights where the hero jumps and hangs in the air for 30 seconds while he beats up all the "Gunday" who go flying 50 feet with a simple kick/punch.Naked/half naked females- There are none in this filmItem number/songs with half naked actress/heroine: Sorry, Not in this film.People who are amused by disgusting sort of comedy e.g. where the hero goes off with the white actress and the sidekick has to sit next to a black person on the bus (Dhoom 3).People who love over the top "comedies" such as slapstick where it's funny because people are running around or because someone slapped someone else.People who want to watch a film with their group of friends. There's not much laugh-out-loud laughter moments but still good laugh if you have a mixed(Pakistani/Indian) group of friends. Who should watch this film:Western audiences will especially love this film as they are used to this type of genre where romantic comedies involve adults comfortable in their relationships and comedy can be more than slapstick or vulgar/sexual jokes (i.e. situational comedy). It has been adapted from the Spanish film "Seres Queridos". The story revolved around Asha(Yami) who belongs to a Hindu Indian family and her boyfriend/fiancé Aman(Ali Zafar) who is a Pakistani Muslim and the whole thing is set in London where everyone is based. The location/settings are authentic, and not an over the top big mansion with a few shots of central London as normally depicted in Indian films. Asha is a successful independent girl and has decided to take the next step forward in her relationship with Aman and wants to take him to meet her family especially her mother(father is too busy with work). She has told her that Aman is Muslim but not that he is also a Pakistani. Story starts where Aman and Asha meet up in central, but a misunderstanding happens with the police, and Aman is taken to the police station where everything gets sorted out but because of this Aman asks to postpone going to Asha's parents as it doesn't seem a good start to the day. Asha convinces him anyway so they carry on to her parent's home and the we see how he is received and the "siyappa" that follows. This includes meeting Asha's mother(Khiron Kher) who's happy Asha's bringing her man along but behind her back doesn't seem too pleased, also Asha's irresponsible sister and her cute 5 year old daughter who loves KKHH and Aman's "magic tricks", further Asha's brother who has a "feud" going on with their downstairs neighbours who happen to be Pakistanis and finally the granddad who is deaf and blind but boasts about shooting Pakistanis in the 1970s war(s).The film subtly seeks to explore the conflict/hate between Indians and Pakistanis and tries to tackle the differences between them to see if there is any middle ground for them to co-exist peacefully, and it uses this sweet romantic comedy as a front. Not one moment of the film is missable, everything happens in it for a reason, great script/dialogues, greatly directed, cinematography is awesome. Anupam Kher has a limited but significant comedic role. Acting by all is outstanding, nothing less expected from the Khers. Ali Zafar and Yami show great chemistry as the couple. Sarah Khan, despite being the supporting actress stands out on her own merit and has her own happy ending :) There are a few minor shortfalls in the execution of the film I think e.g. maybe the pace could have been a bit faster but film is less than two hours anyway, there is no BIG ending, length of the film doesn't need/suit an interval and actually takes away from the suspense, London police don't carry guns, depression pills aren't normally dispensed loose in a bottle(in the UK). Other than these you leave the theater with a "feel-good" mood and like I said if you knew what the film doesn't contain and still watch it then you'll enjoy it.So, to tie it all up, not a film for the general Indian demographic but a definite watch for the International audience."
