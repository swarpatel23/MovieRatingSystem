" Pathetic!","I found this disc as a bonus DVD inside the Kambakht Ishq DVD case (I guess they felt that KI wasn't an adequate enough movie so they tried to up-sell it or soften the blow with this marketing tactic) either that or the movie was put in there to ask the viewer this question: If you think Kambakht Ishq is bad, then what would you say about Dhoom Dadakka.Even as a film that spoofs other films (Race, Dhoom, Dhoom 2, Lage Raho Munna Bhai, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam etc.) it ends up as a hopeless flop that manages to unintentionally spoof itself. I am already accustomed to seeing Gulshan Grover in fluff like this but I just can't even believe Anupam Kher agreed to be in this film.The useless plot is centered around two rival underworld dons (played by Kher and Grover) the former is in search of his nephew to inherit his territory while the latter is trying to convince his queer son to embrace his masculine side and carry on the family business. The songs were good and kept the pace of the movie but it just was not enough to save it."
