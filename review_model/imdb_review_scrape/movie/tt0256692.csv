" Preity Zinta all the way!","This is a generally nice film, with good story, great actors and great songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to attempt some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone?The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother, who will carry their child. They pick Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I mean, isn't it easier to adopt? And even if they pick a girl, does it mean the man has to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? Anyway, I guess if the writers had heard of all this, the film wouldn't have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional.Salman acts very well. It's nice to see him playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani is just about OK; she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta.The film belongs to Preity, who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance. She makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally. She lives the film, emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of her career-best performances. There is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries. She just should do more such roles.The film's ending only highlights what I said above. It is tear-jerking, exciting and very well-acted. Watch it for Preity.7/10 for the film! 10/10 - for Preity!" 
" Want to see Salman in a cool and serious role? Catch this...","After a love triangle story in Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick. The film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from Bharat Shah. Here director duo Abbas-Mustan did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures. They are considered as thriller makers of Bollywood. But in this CCCC they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama. Hardly there is a single action scene when Preity was being raped by Salman's colleague in her apartment, Salman slapped him.The movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song, story, casting, performances etc. which are required to make a movie hit. But of course for Salman's fan this was something a surprise gift from him. Why? Because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance la-la-la all around. His role as a rich young businessman who has no-nonsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive. After all Madhubala, a prostitute role performed by Preity is amazing. Later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention. Her facial expressions and body language become more attractive, and focus mainly goes to her. Her previous role as a pregnant woman in Kya Kehna was not that heart-touching as it is here. Of course, this can be termed as improvement. Then Priya, a very innocent and helpless wife of Raj who only depends on him for a better result. She has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of Preity.Finally, the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself. In real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother. Perhaps, many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret. And in this way the scriptwriter of CCCC has uncovered a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives. But still then it is a doubt." 
" A good effort after all the hype!","The year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing stood out. CCCC had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around India and Abroad. The only information given was that it was a suspense thriller. The film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good. The main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled. Salman And Preiti give a good performance where Salman doesn't actually take is shirt off at all..must be special effects!! Rani plays Salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with Preiti who plays Prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main leads confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry(apparently). Salman Khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the Mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses. Rani's Character does not know Preiti is a prostitute until the end...this kept from her and the rest of the family...the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you. The songs are all picturised well  especially dekhne walon and the main title song. The other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as Salmans loving family. Abbas Mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully..I say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer!" 
" Pretty Woman with a lemon twist","SPOILERSIn Chori Chori Chupke Chupke we see the love of a close family. Amrish Puri plays the patriarch of the Malhotra family. His health is ailing and his one desire before he dies is for his grandson Salman Khan to give him a great grandson. Reluctant at first he eventually gives in to his grandfather and agrees to get married. His family arranges for him to wed Rani Mukherjee and before long they are expecting their first child. Unfortunately Rani miscarries and is told by her doctor that she can't have any children anymore. For fear of disappointing their grandfather they decide to find a surrogate mother, which they do in the prostitute Preity. Things go horribly wrong when Preity falls in love with Salman and her maternal instincts start kicking in...The premise of 4C is quite innovating but too bad it is badly executed. It remains a nice story but it has inconsistencies that have a similar effect as nails on a blackboard. The first half of the story is about the romance between Salman and Rani. Or should I say lack of? Salman and Rani fleetingly meet at a party and promptly her family makes an offer for marriage. What a coincidence... Is this destiny at work? Or does her family make offers to all relatively handsome wealthy men? Her miscarriage forms the turnpoint of the movie. Ofcourse this is a very tragic tearjerky moment that the viewer saw coming miles away. It's kind of like watching Final Destination and wondering which kitchen utensil or household appliance will prove to be 'fatal'. It was sort or reminiscent of the miscarriage scene in Dil Kya Kare except for the actual means.Then Preity enters the frame. Which is also where the nails hit the blackboard. Although adoption seems to be the most obvious alternative, it is certainly understandable that they both want the child to be 'fathered' by Salman. But why a prostitute? I suppose there is a certain truth that in traditional Indian culture an unwed woman would not be willing to get pregnant. But does that mean that there are no such women? Maybe not in India, but what about the rest of the world? Even without taking all this in account, a prostitute is hardly the obvious choice given the time we live in. Ever heard of AIDS or other STD's?What really makes my hair stand at end, however, is the actual getting pregnant bit. There was absolutely no need for Salman to sleep with Preity. Artificial insemination is a complicated procedure which I'm sure the Swiss (where they are staying) have heard of. And even not being interested in AI, there are more primitive methods. For a long time I thought that the turkey baster method was a myth, but if they can do it in If These Walls Could Talk 2 and Popcorn and Chutney, I have two words for our three musketeers... turkey baster.Nonetheless, if ignoring these DETAILS it is still entertaining to watch Rani and Preity at work. You can almost taste Rani's desire to become a mother even if her motives are a little skewed. The star however is Preity. She really is Pretty Woman in her transformation from working girl to... to what? ... herself, I suppose. It's hardly surprising to watch her fall in love with the first man who has ever shown her true affection and respect. In Salman and his family she finally finds the love she has been craving for. Which makes her sacrifice even more noble and touching. Well done Preity. Her love interest is another matter. Salman Khan is a great actor. Unfortunately his character lacks depth. He gets married because his grandfather wants him to. He wants a child because his grandfather wants a great grandchild. He finds a surrogate because his wife wants him to. The makers should have take an extra page out of Pretty Woman and given Salman Richard Gere's spine.Finally the dance sequences and songs are wonderful. Especially No. 1 Punjabi and ofcourse the title song Chori Chori Chupke Chupke.***/5 stars" 
" Great Movie","I love this movie very much i watched it over and over. I don't see why anyone would think this movie wasn't good. Maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it. It is one of my favorite movies and I am not Hindi at all but i do love it. It might be a little like "Pretty Woman" but i haven't seen that and I don't think it's any better than this. I don't know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but I think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie, and to those who say it's not good at all well then I wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good. As for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people don't like it. As for Rani Mukherjee ( i think thats how you spell her last name) she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!"

Rating-8/10" 
" This is not surrogacy.","This movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power, sentimentality and love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this movie was the makers' absurd notion of surrogate mother. A whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man (of the family desiring a child) is not a surrogate mother. Neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I have seen Indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently. The whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible. I realize that most bollywood movies aren't meant to be plausible, but they don't pretend to be either. This movie wants us to emote along with the characters, but this can't done with such a ridiculous, contrived conflict. I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan." 
" Why not adopt????","The movie has every thing that a hindi movie has; a tearjerking story, a utopian joint family, a beyond-dreams-rich business family where no body seems to work, and a lady that could not bear children. There is angle of surrogate mother which is new for bollywood. Every one is exceedingly nice, and every one is trying to please everyone else. The story, however, fails to convince the need for a surrogate mother when adoption can be a better, nicer, and far less complicating option. This movie has a infamous side as well. the producer Bharat Shah is supposed to be neck deep in money-laundry for Mumbai Mafia and he is still incarcerated ( or at least I hope he still is!!)" 
" Preity shined through...!","It is said that some of the scenes from this movie are borrowed from the Hollywood movie "Pretty Woman",which i think is a interesting fact. The love-triangle between the characters of Salman Khan, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukerji was a very interesting one as it was not so very original. To want a child so much that you would be willing to share your man to another woman just to have a child-are insane in my opinion. Watched this movie very long time ago, but i found that Zinta overshadowed everyone with her bubbly character as a prostitute. Even if i wished for her to get her man,i was satisfied with the ending anyway. Everyone got somehow what they wanted." 
" Mostly Solid Drama","In this drama, happily married Raj (Salman Khan) and Priya (Rani Mukerji) are devastated to learn that Priya can not have children. She considers adoption, but for certain reasons, settles on the idea of a secret surrogate pregnancy. Raj finds a young prostitute, Madhubala (Preity Zinta) who is willing to carry a child for the couple. As can be expected, the path chosen by Raj and Priya is not a smooth one.For the most part, this is a solidly good film, that has the viewer uncertain as to what will be the eventual outcome. Those familiar with Hollywood's Pretty Woman, will recognize certain scenes, but they work quite well in this setting, too. Khan seems to have only one emotion in this movie, and Mukerji spends most of her time weeping. However, they are generally convincing in their roles, especially as they are the backdrop for Zinta's exceptional performance as Madhu. Regardless of how one feels about the topic, the movie is worth watching for her alone. The cast also includes Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal, Prem Chopra, and Johnny Lever." 
" Salman khan rocks","Best actor award should have been to salman khan This movie was so entertaining but it's really enjoyable Songs are really mesmerizing background music is not poor Perfect storyline outstanding screenplay impressive editing amazing direction Salman khan is superb preity zinta is awesome rani mukerjee steals the show Overall 8/10 or 4/5 stars Never miss this blockbuster" 
" too good Story very interesting","Very interesting Movie Must Watch Salman Khan Preity and Rani awesome" 
" Good enough for me. *ONE SPOILER*","The plot is fine enough, but let's admit that surrogate mothers type of stories has been done to death. So it's really fortunate that this film has terrific performances to bank on. There's no questioning Preity and Rani's capabilities. They're among Bollywood's best performers and they certainly help to liven up CCCC. Surprise, surprise, Salman comes with a good performance himself. His restrained acting is a fresh change (for the better!). For once, he doesn't take his shirt off and I thank God for that. It would have done damaged to the film. One thing I like about CCCC is that it doesn't drag. It comes straight to the point. Rani and Salman's courtship is short and sweet. They don't take ages to introduce Preity's character. And I especially love the scene where a pregnant Rani dances in her room. There are subtle suggestions of impending doom and I truly commend directors Abbas-Mustan for executing that particular scene with style! All said and done, CCCC makes for good entertainment and hopefully, Rani and Preity will get Filmfare Award nominations (if not the Awards themselves) for their roles." 
" An Entertainer with fine performances & music.","Chori Chori Chupke Chupke has all the ingredients to be a success of 2001 after "Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai", which was the huge success of 2000.This is a remake of "Doosri Dulhan" which starred Sharmila Tagore, Shabana Azmi and Victor Bannerjee, where all the three performers delivered excellent performances. The visible difference with that movie is its presentation and youthful lively characterization with Anu Malik's music.The film begins with some light moments with some songs well filmed on abroad locations, later takes an emotional turn with the entry of Priety Zinta, as a prostitute, who is chosen by Salman Khan to conceive his baby.All the three characters have done a splendid job, but the winner is undoubtedly Priety Zinta, the film belongs to her, she has performed very well as a prostitute who encounters a different world after entering in the life of Salman Khan.Even though getting less scope Salman Khan performs lively  and underplays the character as per demand, Rani Mukerjee too has done her part of job pretty well.Rest Johny Lever, Amrish Puri & Farida Jalal did as usual.Abbas Mustan, the director brothers has a good grip on script, especially in the second half of the movie,Music Director Anu Malik has come up with one of the catchy title song "Rag rag main is tarah...", dialogues by Javed Siddiqui are also worth appreciation with some meaningful lines.The only draw back is its unacceptable story idea, but the positive aspects are enough to make it a box office success." 
" ...which means :Stealthily - hidingly","Hail Bollywood and men Directors !Really this is the ultimate limit in utter sacrifice made by Indian Woman !!Viewing the current state of affairs in India where The wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very possessive about their husbands - the Directors ..also can be called Uncle Scars (refer movie The Lion King) came up with a very new concept on how both the kept and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between themselves ...including the spermikins !!Story line : Married couple - very happy - but accidentally a mishap happens and wife has a miscarriage - lost the foetus along with the capacity of ever becoming a mother !Now in in India, the in- laws usually drive away the daughter- in- law if she fails to give them an heir ! So the wife hits upon a major plan - surrogate mother...but the scientists intervened - "Sure artificial insemination" - NO said the artist (Director actually) - "Neighbourhood will come to know that the daughter - in - law is barren so they are going for surrogate mother !!Neighbours ! society !! gosh the same ones who watch Fashion TV day and night - watching girls between the age group of 14 to 40 ...al in bras and panties - well those neighbors suddenly take an upper hand in family planning and decision making !!SO the wife sends away her husband to a beer bar where girls are dancing on the stage - all mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men love such women as they can satisfy their egos a lot !He hires the lead dancer in the pub - asks her to bear his baby - in exchange for money - she agrees - she comes home - becomes pregnant - wife and kept - both co-exist in the same house - in the mean time the prostitute also gets a taste of household life - so much caring people around - she misses them all and cries silently !! In the mean time - no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter in law is roaming around with a pillow beneath her petticoat !!- the mother or other elderly people never took her for check-ups - nor did they try to feel the baby's movements in the womb !!" 
" It's a mystery all right","The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents. This is Bollywood at its best/worst, I honestly cannot tell the difference. Nauseatingly sweet, kitschy clichés on every level, story-line, situations, dialog, music and choreography. To put it bluntly, you must be a retard to enjoy it. I watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to walk away from it, because I could not take it any more. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses."
