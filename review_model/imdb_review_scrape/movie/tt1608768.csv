" Awesome!","Speaking from the heart, It was the first movie after Ram Gopal Verma's , "Satya", that brought tears to my eyes. I literally wept, although I consider myself to be "Macho" like every other Indian guy!Hats off to "Mahesh Manjrekar".The only thing I really didn't like seeing in the movie was the actress "Anousha Dandekar", I know it was probably to show that the "Writer Brother" did well in his life, but still, im sorry to say she looks like "na ghar ka na ghat ka" maybe that was what the director wanted.But every time I see her on-screen, or tele(MTV), I remember her remark about Mahatma Gandhi, on a show she hosted so long ago, and well it hurts.Overall, the movie was eye watering, and very close to heart. Thank you to everyone who made this happen. I will go buy the DVD, although I can easily download it over the net, I won't, this DVD will be a part of my very small collection of favorite movies.Thats how much I liked it ;D" 
" Awesome movie!!!!","I don't know how to start my review.. Seriously, I thought of starting like "Damn good work, man!!", but I don't know what to write.. Mahesh Manjarekar is one with enormous talents, really!! What a movie, man!! Each character has got depth, brilliant performances, apt lighting, and a tight screenplay. The only drawback to say is that, the movie seems a little bit dramatic at places. Otherwise, the movie deserves 10/10.Set in the Mumbai of the 1980s, the movie deals with the mill workers' life , who made the city into what it is now. The movie is executed brilliantly, damn good!! Mr Manjarekar should direct more movies, we miss your talent, sir!! The casting is perfect, the performances are very good, Many people are newcomers, I guess from the theatre background. The guys performed well, Siddharth Jadhav was awesome as Speedbreaker. The girl who played Manju was awesome. Seema Biswas is just a WoWWW!!! Excellent performance. Sachin Khedekar was good. Satish Kaushik's role was very good. Kashmira Shah has got a meatier role to perform this time, and she proves that she can do well in terms of acting also. The rest of the cast was good, the ad-wala guy who played Jignesh was good.No scope for the music, except for a semi-item song in Marathi, during the credits. On the whole, Mahesh Manjarekar is a talented director, and he proves it once again in this movie. Very well made movie, watch it!!!" 
" Movie is okay but some brilliant performances","The movie is okay but good in parts.The performance from Siddharth Jadhav (Speed-Breaker) and Seema Biswas are brilliant and make the movie worth watching.The movie does divert from the main subject though and end up as a family drama. But still tells the tale of Bombay (now Mumbai). Some of the scenes are perfectly shot to create the old era of now the "City of Gold".A couple of scenes after the logical ending were unnecessary and spoils the tone of the movie. Mahesh Manjerakar's rap in the end was a welcome surprise. The wording was also good.A worth watch!" 
" Its Mahesh Manjrekar's spirited Indian edition of CITY OF GOD.","The first time I heard the title of this lesser known movie "City Of Gold", it reminded me of the famous masterpiece from Brazil called "City Of God". And now after watching it, I can surely say that though it revolves around a realistic plot about the closure of all Mumbai textile mills in the eighties, still Mahesh must have had "City of God" and its young cruel criminals, somewhere at the back of his mind while making this.But the above comment should not be taken as anything negative against the director since it's not easy to go anywhere near the "City of God". Mahesh has made this movie with his strong conviction and the end result brings him back with his golden touch of "Vaastav". In fact, only a person with a first-hand experience of the city and those tough times could have made such a movie with perfection, depicting the ground reality of the struggle faced by all the mill workers and their families in those difficult years."City of Gold" revolves around a particular family and their neighbors living in a local chawl. The head of the family is waiting for his gratuity income to be released by the Mill owners after his retirement and his 3 young sons are still struggling to make some money in their own legitimate and illegitimate styles. Their only sister gets caught in the love web of a local shop owner which puts the family in a more embarrassing situation than ever. Mahesh brilliantly puts forward the hardships suffered by the family in his own unique style which also reminds the viewer of a few scenes seen in his "Vaastav". But one doesn't mind the similarity as the narration just takes you on with its racy pace and superb acting by its entire cast ensemble on the screen.The best scenes of the movie include the ones written around the young kids and adolescents, who are excited enough to hold the gun and pull its trigger to kill anybody. The sequences involving the young ones killing for fun, food and revenge are the most intense and disturbing sequences of the script which are even capable of influencing the youth watching the movie. And for that reason the film is strictly meant for adults only.Another worth watching aspect of "City of Gold" is the way Mahesh presents the internal fights of a poor family and its unintentional consequences with sheer perfection. It's like listening to the voices of some real life family characters living next door, fighting with each other on their monetary issues. Manjrekar also touches many serious social issues like forced abortion, suicides due to poverty, builder-criminal nexus, government's involvement in the proceedings and direction less youth surrendering to crime, in his realistic portrayal of the city. The movie is sure going to be an eye opener for all the youngsters who simply have no idea about what was there before all these big shopping malls and multiplexes came into existence in their city. However, apart from all the above mentioned merits of the movie, I still found something missing in it which could not revive the magic of watching Mahesh's earlier take on youth crime. On second thoughts, I found two points which were more or less responsible for restricting "City of Gold" to reach a cult status of its own.One, due to the excess attention given to all those gripping scenes of the youth involving in crime, the movie slips from its main plot of Mill workers and their fight for their rights.In the second half it more becomes like an underworld flick revolving around the builder-criminal nexus killing everyone in the end.And Second, even though the movie is high on content, superb in execution and moves at a great speed following a brilliant edit, yet it scores quite low on the emotional quotient. Apart from a few scenes, the viewer doesn't really feel related to anyone on the screen emotionally. Due to the presence of too many characters in the script they all lack the much needed depth in their characterization. More specifically, I found the emotional connect missing in the movie which is a must in a realistic project like this. As the end credits role, you are impressed and majorly satisfied yet don't feel sorry for any character dying on the screen covered with blood all over the body.Still, it is a commendable effort from Mahesh Manjrekar, from whom a good Hindi project was due from quite long now. "City of Gold" is also worth watching for its outstanding performances from the entire cast. Every person in the movie delivers one of the most memorable acts of his or her career. But special mention has to be made of Seema Biswas (as the mother), Siddharth Yadav (as Speed Breaker) and Karan Patel as the young leader of the gang giving a splendid performance which is sure going to be noticed by the industry.Musically, the movie has one regional song in its opening titles which sets the mood in. Background score contributes a lot to build up the tense feel and Camera-work is superb capturing the 80s era and the current scenario together in its realistic frame. But it is not meant for the soft romantic lovers who have a tendency to find romance in almost every scene of a movie. "City of Gold" is dark, it's grim and is not for the faint hearted either. So go for it if you can appreciate the bloody genre of movies where killing a person is as simple as singing around the trees. Its Mahesh Manjrekar's spirited Indian edition of the world famous CITY OF GOD. It may not be a masterpiece but indeed a worth watching movie based on reality." 
" The story of Mumbai; From an industrial capital to the costliest piece of real estate.","The movie starts as a flash back for a middle aged man who books a flat in Mumbai and recalls his younger days, when his father was a mill worker at the same property. Yes, it does sound like an Amitabh or Rajesh Khanna starer from the late 70s or 80s. The story line is simple, life and struggle of mill workers and their families. The treatment is however new. Reminds us in parts of "Cidade De Deus" or City of God,an award winning Portuguese film on violent neighborhood of Rio De Janeiro. Mahesh Manjrekar is however no Fernando Meirelles, nevertheless it is a commendable effort.The movie may not be a 'Vastav' or 'Satya' but it is not far behind.The story line is fast paced, actions are real,emotional scenes do emote and all actors look genuine in their parts. I have personally liked the movie and am sure you would watch it and form your own opinion." 
" Has the director seen other mumbai-based slum movies?!","Vaastav still remains Mahesh Manjrekar's biggest hit till date - City of Gold was not even half of what Vaastav was. I was so excited to see this movie however it turned out to be one of the biggest disappointment of the year. The hype behind the movie was an untold story and the director's name but to tell you the truth - the core message of the movie that should have been was lost between a family's problems in poverty. The mill-workers that it is supposed to be based upon were only seen as poor people and any other mumbai-based slum movie would have shown what it did. Many of the actors were look-alikes e.g. Naru (character name) resembled R Madhavan and his brother resembled another TV actor which made this a little on the funnier side. Some tragedy scenes were done so tragically that it turned out to be funnier at times.Bad acting, bad screenplay, nothing new - just not worth the time and money. After having seen Vaastav and Satya (by RGV) this movie falls flat."

" A failed Indian version of City of God","A lesser known movie by Mahesh Manjrekar. It's based on the several events in the life of mill workers after their capitalist young owner moves to put an end to their professions and more in 80s. What was derived from the impressive poster, the same lost its consistency during the course. You wait for the pace to pick up, you get disappointed. The narrator of the story is voice dubbed by Manjrekar himself. Everything can go wrong with poor people. While the story was leaving cold trails, the acting performances by the whole cast is awe inspiring. Seema Biswas as the role of the mother has struck gold. If only the story stayed in a constant path, it would have fetched larger audiences. Add the illogical dialogs at places, you get a two hours of disappointment. This movie has to be watched only for the outstanding performance by most of the cast and nothing else. Otherwise we can easily skip this one for another recent raunchy release." 
" a well told story","I saw the movie after i read the review on IMDb. and moreover i was waiting to watch this movie... so finally i saw this movie and i kind of disagree with the above review.. i agree that it was about only a family.. but it was a family of mill workers.. i think this movie revolves around the mill workers and a story told well about the past.. Now everyone cannot be James Cameron.. to make AVATAr after TITANIC and beat his own record.. Life in MUMBAI remains the same for all stories.. that city is out of this world... even if 'Johnny Depp' had to make 'shantaram'. i am sure it would have had most of the same thing... now one cant predict anything different from a story about MUMBAI... The characters played fairly a decent role to bring about the feelings and behaviors of the then mill workers'. It is simply a story of how the poor mill workers where cheated to bring about the consumerism to make money.. at the end those people suffered and most of the people from MUMBAI, enjoy it today...whatever... IT IS A STORY WELL TOLD.." 
" Terrible!","Went with high hopes to see this one.Was truly disappointed. Bad is the only word which comes in my mind. Absolute terrible acting by some actors. Thought the director wants to show what the mill workers went through. Instead the movie revolves round a family with their personal problems. The second half is entirely pathetic.You will get a feeling when this will end.Guess the director was a bit inspired by City of god.You can reflect that in some (terrible) scenes.The opening song is unnecessary.The director i guess was caught in a dilemma, whether to make a serious film or a film for all types of audience. Save your time and money!" 
" A completely pointless movie","The movie has nothing to do with the stated theme: "The cotton mill workers of Mumbai". The whole movie is focused on the misery of one out-of-work mill-worker's family, where the awkwardness of the lives of 6 adults cramped in a Mumbai chawl (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chawl) is supposed to be funny and tragic at the same time. That story is no different than the story of untold millions of poor people in India, which has already been the subject of much better movies. Nothing is said about the collective economics, politics, legislation, psychology of workers & management, or competition, which leads to such a situation in the first place. Its just another Mumbai slum movie with the same socialist tinge that graced the 70's movies: "industrialists are so evil they are always trying to burn down their own factories, and that there is some kind of nobility in poverty".And the audio (at least in the disc I got: MoserBaerHomeVideo/Reliance) is terrible. The dialog is subdued in too many places, while all kinds of fights and crashes are extremely loud. Coupled with that are the unwarranted & senselessly loud surround sound effects, but that is the common trait of most Bollywood movies, to force create suspense/shock/thrill where it doesn't naturally exist in the plot or the scene."
