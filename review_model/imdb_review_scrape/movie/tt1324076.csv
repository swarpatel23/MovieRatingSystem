" Leaves more to desire....","Fox promises to be a mystery-suspense-thriller. The performances of all the lead actors is the best part of the movie. Had Deepak spent more time tightening the loose ends, Fox would have turned out to be an intelligent thriller. ﮭ Arjun Rampal:: Post Rock On, this guy has mastered the grammar of performance. He delivers at ease.ﮭ Sunny Deol:: Makes an entry just before the first-half and it is sad to see Sunny to be cut-down to such short roles. He should seriously re- invent himself. His character is pretty much the same we have seen umpteen number of times earlier.ﮭ Sagarika Ghatke:: The "Chak De" is pretty glamorous and deserved more room to showcase her performance. ﮭ Udita:: Nothing great - safe to say "usual".ﮭ Vipul Gupta:: Perhaps his character was simply loud and used for diversion.On technical front, the direction is good barring the jerky camera movements at few places.While the audience expect "clever as a fox", Deepak Tijori delivers "crazy like a fox". Recommended only if aired on telly." 
" Starts out well but goes downhill from there...","This film starts off right away (my sister and I started watching it together and she went to the kitchen for 5 minutes and swore that I had fast forwarded it when she returned -- I hadn't and a quick rewind proved that) if you blink you might miss an important clue.But all that said, the greatness of the film is ruined by pointless banal songs and lackluster dance numbers. Bollywood should learn that not every genre of their films should include songs. Everything kind of starts to go downhill from the introduction of the first song and the movie itself becomes a predictable variation of Hollywood's thriller 'The Taking of Pelham 123'. The suspense is sucked out of the entire film by the addition of pointless scenes, especially the ones including Sagarika Ghatge(Chak de India) who is supposed to be a lawyer but ends up playing to role of detective. Sunny Deol, Udita Goswami and Rituparna Sen Gupta co-star but the film belongs to Arjun Rampal whose acting seems to have truly improved these days." 
" Bad acting.","What an awful movie. There was a lot of bad acting in it. The movie is very slow. You only get to hear about the book "Fix the fox", but you don't get top see something about the murders, what could have made the movie interesting to watch.Camera work is bad and not always consistent. A scene where Arjun looses himself the camera which is focusing on him is messy. The shot next with a girl is steady and then the third shot with Arjun is also steady. This doesn't work.When Sunny Deol is a very careful man, why has he a hidden room in his house with all evidence pointing against himself? Isn't that stupid?I didn't like "A murder of crows" and this movie isn't even better." 
" Don't be prejudiced - it's too good.","If you are not prejudiced towards Sunny Deol, then you are going to love this movie if you watch it. I donno if it's copied or not, but it's well taken. It's sad that some deserving films don't get to do well at the box office.The movie is a thriller that revolves around a corrupt lawyer turned good lawyer who retires from service,and gets involved in a series of murders he hasn't committed, when he dons the identity as the author of a book which he doesn't actually write. The investigating officer in the case is played by Sunny.The rest is about how and if Arjun is able to get out of the melee he is in.Direction is excellent, songs are noteworthy, acting is good, and the climax is unique. If you've watched Sunny Deol films before,you'll see that.9 stars for FOX" 
" Murder of Crows","Based on an awesome movie - murder of crows (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133985/).As I started watching the movie, it kept coming to my mind that there is an awesome movie/novel previously made and after 1 hour of search on Google finally recalled the movie name - murder of crows. I think this is a great film coming out of bollywood, but the ending could have been much better.Great story but I think the creators were thinking about the Hollywood movie and creating a bollywood movie. I am sure if this was converted to a more desi flick, it would have attracted much larger audience. It had a mixed flavor of both bollywood and Hollywood. Though I am not able to put finger on what exactly.I am sure people will enjoy this movie - even though you have seen the Hollywood version. :)" 
" The climax makes it a below average flick.","Deepak Tijori has earlier been associated with movies inspired from the Western flicks like "Fareb", "Oops" &"Khamosh". With "Fox" he continues trying his luck in the thriller genre and once again fails to hit the nail rightly. Bollywood has delivered very few worth mentioning thrillers in the past and "Fox" is clearly not an exception to this fact.In a crime thriller revolving around a famous criminal lawyer (Arjun Rampal) and a tough investigation police officer (Sunny Deol), the viewer expects to be taken for a tricky ride with new twists and turns coming every few minutes into the movie. But the latest offering from Deepak moves at a snail pace without any unexpected revelations to surprise the viewer. The movie starts off well, where a famous criminal lawyer who is known for saving murderers from the court goes through a heart transformation. However, where the first sequence of the movie looks fresh, interesting and inviting, the remaining part of it disappoints completely.Without going into the suspense part of the plot, I would only like to state that the major point which goes against this movie, is its poorly written, absurd climax. As you are shown the real person responsible for the entire blame game, you just drop your head down. It's simply unimaginable to believe the reasons why Arjun Rampal was chosen as a target by the main culprit. So whatever good, the movie had in store in its favor, gets simply ruined by the badly conceived climax and you just don't want to think about it anymore walking out of the hall.Going at par with the movie, apart from Arjun alone, everyone else is trying to deliver more than he/she is capable of. Udita Goswami does a repeat act, similar to her previous movies. May be she had some problems with the makers, since she is simply taken out of the script towards the climax. Sagarika Ghatge is just OK, but was this the role she was waiting for after "Chakk De"? Sunny Deol looks like doing a favor to the producers while playing his part. He again comes only a few minutes before the interval doing a routine act close to his "Khel". Only Arjun Rampal looks well fitted in his role and has performed well (but he surely could have done without using that strange wig on his head).Monty Sharma's music is only there to fill the space with few below average songs. Camera-work & Background score serves the purpose fine. Director, Deepak Tijori does show an improvement from his previous works but I hope this is not an inspired version of an English movie as his last movie "Khamosh". He manages to present some well shot sequences in the first half but it's the climax which makes the movie simply below average. To sum up, I wish the movie had a complete different culmination." 
" A dead Fox","Deepak Tijori was mostly a sidekick in Hindi films but as a director his films are even worseFOX could've been a good thriller but ends up a routine Hindi film The promos were interesting but the film ends up being a typical Hindi film with a long introduction for Arjun Rampal to some chase scenes The climax is the worst partDirection is awful Music is okayArjun Rampal has improved and seems confident on screen and acts well Sunny too in a subtle yet short role does well and thankfully no shouts Udita is okay and so are the others" 
" Really bad movie!","Everything about the movie is sloppy. To establish the credentials of the main character, they show a case where he proves that the murdered lady was a person of low character and that the sex was consensual. The argument is so lackluster that it fails to impress. It does not make Arjun Rampal appear as a brilliant lawyer. At least they could have added some legal terminology to his dialogues, they could have made the case slightly tricky to underscore the skills of the defense lawyer. Arjun Rampal was bad as a lawyer, not very convincing. His language or body language does not convince me that he is a lawyer. He might as well have been a cop or paid assassin or even a model!When he goes to Goa, he meets the author of Fix the Fox, a book that is supposed to be a masterpiece! First of all, the name is ridiculous! I could not even figure out why this title? And every character that picks up the book or the manuscript always praises the title! Sagarika Ghatge is slightly OK. The other lady is pathetic! She is supposed to be the owner of a publisher house, she appears to be an item song girl or some such pathetic profession! No effort is made to make her look like a publisher.Sunny Deol is awful. He does not suit the role of a police officer with a Marathi name. Direction is bad. The story does not move very fast. I miss the days when brilliant directors like Goldie Anand used to make people sit on the edge of their seat throughout the movie.The climax is awful and unconvincing, just like the rest of the movie! I hope the movie flopped at the box office."
