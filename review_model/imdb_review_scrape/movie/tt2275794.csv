" Makes you wonder that for whom they actually made this & why?","Certain films raise not one or two but several questions in your mind about the team behind its making and their basic thought structure before going ahead with such tasteless, ridiculous and uninspiring kind of script without giving it a second thought. So instead of writing a usual review, here I would like to share my conclusions after watching this 'quite hard to see' romantic comedy, wherein I neither found the romance nor any comedy as calmly promoted by its makers with a pretty bad song. 1. "You are a born film-maker!" Now this phrase can be interpreted in two ways. One when a person has a great, gifted talent of film-making in him, which he has developed through his own efforts and hard work, working in the field for years before being called a Film-maker. And Two, when a person has simply got born in the family related to film business or movie-making and therefore obviously becomes a Film-maker by default. (And the same theory goes for the actors too in many cases) 2. Sometimes a project just gets all the needed approvals from a corporate house without any objections raised, simply because of the big names backing it from the front, even when there is no script, storyline or an idea shared about what actually they are approving and putting their money in. 3. In such ventures, even the actors don't know what they are actually being signed for, since the script is yet to be given a thought after finalizing the entire schedule and dates. 4. And when the need of the script arises, they just mix and match few of their senior's famous films hurriedly, as if there are only fools coming to the theater and they can be served anything in the name of a film with some glossy faces and songs. 5. Such projects try to incorporate everything which is trending around without any set vision. So if Punjabi is the in-thing, they get a completely insane and horrible song written around a Punjabi word used for the 'Bums' and just don't care to enquire about its actual use in the language at all! (And it was this song, questionably written as "Tooh", which simply left me with jaws open in disbelief and disgust like never before in all these recent decades honestly. In fact I cannot remember a Hindi film song falling to this sick and ridiculous level ever to say the least.) 6. Normally in the first day shows of a film, all the theater attendants, caretakers and torch-men are also very much interested in watching the new film, standing quietly along the wall with their eyes on the screen. But in a film such as GORI TERE PYAAR MEIN, even they walk out of theaters after an hour or so and never return back even post intervals. 7. When film-makers who perhaps have never been to any real village or remote areas, try to show a village in their film as per their forced-in script demand. Then it's pretty obvious that it turns out to be completely artificial, senseless and fake, since they haven't got the vision to portray such earthy elements on the screen in reality. And that is possibly the reason why GTPM truly becomes unbearable in its second half as it shifts into a fake village wherein a bridge is to be built in a pure LAGAAN or SWADES style by the star architect. 8. A film like GTPM does teach you a valuable lesson of life too, that sometimes even when there is everything available on the table to make a delicious dish, the cook still may make a silly mess out of it due to his over-confidence or no fear of a failure at all (read no-work) in the near future. 9. Lastly, GTPM strongly makes you wonder that did its makers really knew that for whom or for which target audience they were actually making this film and Why? To end with, if a newcomer (or a struggler writer) would have gone to any of the production houses related with the film, with this SCRIPT in hand to make a movie on. Then either he would have got the rejection right away in hours or the script would have been thrown in the bin as soon as he has gone out of the office after reading only its few opening pages. Anyway, searching for the only silver lining in this black cloud, there are 10 odd minutes of beautiful Shraddha Kapoor in the film, which are watchable. And in case you are too serious to watch her on the screen post AASHIQUI 2, then just see the film at a lower cost ticket before the intermission and simply walk away." 
" Gori tere pyaar mein is awesome","Gori tere pyaar mein is an awesome movie. Most of the people having problem with this movie either don't know what bollywood is all about or are plain biased and are here to bring down the movie as there were multiple releases on the date of gori tere pyaar mein's release and this movie going down will only benefit their favourite stars . Agreed both the main leads of this movie are at the low point of their careers and hence such negativity is unavoidable but gori tre pyaar is an awesome movie with some really amazing moments and good performances and the best part is that it gives the audience a jab we met feeling. Ask this to somebody who has really seen the movie and isn't biased towards a particular actor and he/she will share the same opinion. All i am saying is that you give the movie a try on it's merits and not give in to all the negativity. Kareena kapoor has always been an amazing actress and imran khan has transformed into a much better actor in his last few movies. The songs are great and peppy too, you would have a hell of a time and enjoy a lot, trust me." 
" Surprisingly Good !!","Rom-com flicks are one of genre which has not been experimented in Bollywood much lately. Gori Teri Pyaar Mein is refreshing change for Indian audiences who have witnessed an overdose of masala films in 2013.Sriram Venkat(Played by Imran Khan) is good-for-nothing architect working in his dad's firm who has no respect for any relationships. Dia (played by Kareena Kapoor) is a social crusader who wants to help the needy. They fell in love only to break-up. However, Sriram travels to a remote village to build a bridge for the local people to win back his love at any cost. From the director of "I Hate Love Story", Puneet Malhotra does a fine job in trying out something different. Though the love story is predictable, it is the treatment of subject that makes it set apart. The first half is hilarious, fun and has moments to remember. Second half begins with a bang but the climax makes it a spoilsport. How I wish it could be handled with maturity and overall it would have been a good rom-com to watch. Screenplay looses the steam and insertion of songs breaks the momentum of the film. Music by Vishal-Shekhar is a let down. Cinematography is eye-catching. Art direction is good. Dialogues are believable. Kareena Kapoor is the eye-candy of the film. She does an awesome job playing the social activist role with aplomb. Imraan Khan is good but still has to work on his expressions. Overall, I liked the film and found it to be surprisingly fair entertainment. Good 3/5" 
" Done to Death....Also Karan Johar should wake up and smell coffee","There's nothing new to expect from such a film after seeing the promos, Imran Khan back to romcoms after his experiments like Maitru Ki Bhijli Ka Mandola and OUATIM Dobara failed. He thought perhaps he will be safe as it's Karan Johar production and his most films are hits, whether there have anything or no. The last time Punit and KJO teamed with Imran was in I HATE LOVE STORYS in 2010 when Imran's films were failing, like Kidnap and Luck, the film worked Imran again worked in EMAET in 2012 which teamed with Kareena Kapoor, this time again the jodi is repeated however in a repetitive set up. The film starts off okay, the song Dhat Teri Ki is already a hit and it provides a good start but the film is hardly anything imaginative in the first half, The first half is a mere set up while the second half shifts to a hamlet on Gujarat Border where Imran goes in search for his love who is a social worker who works for a NGO. There are lot of implausible sequences in the film, like Kareena's NGO act but she doesn't think twice before cheating while trying to get through a traffic, even worse she dances at a song named TOOH meaning butt. Karan Johar lives in his own lala land and his films are hardly realistic, The ease at which the villagers construct the bridge is too hard to digest, even there lot more implausible situations The film is very predictable and gets boring tooDirection by Punit is nothing great Music is good, Dhat Teri Ki is superb, Naina is okay, Dil Duffer is amazing, Tooh is also good typicaly KJO type, Imran Khan has done such roles before and doesn't add anything new, also his eyebrow dancing does get irritating, He is okay but nothing different Kareena Kapoor Khan is good in her part which isn't written properly Amongst rest Anupam Kher is good in his part, Shraddha Kapoor is good in a small role rest are okay" 
" Director ensures that bollywood is capable of producing good Romantic-comedies.","Movie is a love story of complete opposites.Gori tere Pyaar mein is about Sriram Venkat(Played by Imran Khan) is a young architect who doesn't value relationships. & Dia (Kareena Kapoor) is his complete opposite. She is a social activist who wants to build a carrer of her own. Like most romantic relationships, they fall in love, break-up and then fall in love again. The story itself is extremely predictable.however it works because of its vibrant energy.The make up & break up scenes are very well executed. Direction: Punit Malhotra has done a great job.He has improved a lot since his last movie.The movie has flaws but it is immensely watchable because of the directors gud work and Music. Star Performances: Imran khan impresses as Sriram.He acted really well in the romantic as well as the emotional scenes. Kareena Kapoor is a charmer.Her performance in this movie is treat to all. But the chemistry between Imran Khan & Kareena Kapoor is what adds life to the movie. Shraddha Kapoor& Anupam Kher are brilliant too. Music:Gori Tere Pyar mein has the best album of the year so far.Songs are brilliantly picturised and well placed. kudos to Vishal & ShekharIn the end Gori Tere Pyaar Mein is highly watchable. You can easily go and watch & enjoy with your family and friends. It is a complete family entertainer. Watch this feel-good movie to have good time. My ratings : 7/10" 
" Light Love Story","Like history, contemporary Bollywood is passing through the era of usual or you can call it typical Bollywood masala movies' era where there will be no logic or any special thing. Hero would beat even 1000 enemies fighting with swords, heavy clubs and other crap stuff like this. These days very seldom one would find use of modern weapons in Indian movies during action. I don't know what is reason for it. Perhaps they have smuggled all of their arms to Pakistan to spread terror there. Anyways in this era of crap movies here comes a light entertainment. Not as much as one would expect from dharma productions but still it would provide you with some fresh air. Acting wise Imran khan is superb in his acting and expressions. Kareena kapoor is beautiful and charming and Anupam kher is a savior as always.On the whole it is a light love story that can make your world of depression and noise light and peaceful. Recommended." 
" A pair of mis-matched young lovers find that indeed, they do have something in common after all.","Gori Tere Pyaar MeinA review by Dr Deena PadayacheeThis film was, for me, worth seeing. There are so many parallels with our own country. If you would be bored by a tale of pampered, romantic young activists choosing to live rough and trying to cope with arrogance, corruption, inertia, and thieves and saboteurs, then perhaps you should stay well away from this sparkling movie.This superb sub-titled Hindi film is about a Tamil lad, Sriram, who has an arranged encounter with a beautiful Tamil lass whose heart has already been snatched by a Sikh. However Sriram has also fallen for a glamorous, but older North Indian social activist who playfully calls him, 'Sridevi', who is a great Tamil movie actress.I thought that this was going to be a boring tale, till suddenly the story took an unexpected turn and lands in Gujarat.Now, like many of you, I am accustomed to encountering light-skinned, hyper-intelligent, super-wealthy Gujarati, some of whom have the unerring knack of happily making you feel very black, stupid and irrelevant. However it was quite a surprise to see a side of Gujarat with which I am completely unfamiliar. The roads depicted, if anything, were worse than South Africa's and the public transport system made one feel that this state has entrepreneurs who would fit in very well in the more venal corridors of some South African govt complexes. The other surprise was that many of the villagers were not particularly light skinned. The village is replete with animal excrement and the most basic amenities from electricity to tap water are a problem. And they are not all that noble either! What a surprise this aspect of Gujarat was! The parallel with the corruption-ridden Transkei was over-whelming. Gujarat spawned Gandhi. The Transkei gave birth to Nelson Mandela. But both states are in a particularly parlous state. The behaviour of the current crop of thieves and politicians is so disrespectful to the legacy that has been bequeathed by such great leaders. I am sure that most of have read how brand new Transkei schools have been dismantled right down to the toilets and children have to be educated out-doors. Even ambulances have been stolen.The Gujarati children have to traverse a dangerous, delicate rope bridge in order to get to school. The corruption, arrogance and the nauseating, irresponsible, child-like, ubermenschen attitude of the elected officials made one think, inevitably, of the local variety we know so well. Imran Khan plays a young Bangalore person, Sriram - the kind of South African clone that one often encounters – an irresponsible, immature, rudderless, materialistic, childish fellow (very much like many of the off-spring of some of us) who cares not a hoot for the achievements of the heroes who gave their lives for Indian freedom; he certainly does not have any respect for his antecedents and simply wants to enjoy women, wine and song – simultaneously. Then, in Gujarat, thanks to Dia, he encounters politicians who are as materialistic, selfish and as irresponsible as he is. But Sriram lives in this Gujarati village and he begins to develop a conscience and even a sense of love for his country and his people – a poor, brutalised, exploited people whose blood is his blood. It reminded me of a then unpublishable tale I wrote in 1988 called 'A Letter to the Mayor' which had the Mayor of Durban deciding that he needed to stay in a disenfranchised township as he needed to share the woes of his people. He moves to Phoenix.The dialogue is intelligent and the acting is superb. Kareena Kapoor Khan plays Dia whom a venal politician dubs 'Mother India'. There is even a scene where all traffic is brought to a complete halt by vacuous cops (in military-style uniforms) so that politicians can drive by in a convoy like royalty. Dia deals with that in a feminine way and had us guffawing. I think even Gandhi would have smiled – and been appalled by the behaviour of the supercilious big wigs who feel they can do just about anything and get away with it. Nothing happens easily or quickly. From politicians who could not care less to gargantuan egos and Lilliputian minds our heroic pair encounter the full gamut of obstacles as they try to do the right thing but are obstructed at every turn. Love is certainly a bizarre phenomenon. This older woman is so much trouble for our hero but he does not give up. Sriram is loyal, loving and zealous. He's quite an inspiration. He constantly comes up with ways to over-come problems and wins Dia's heart. Oh, the clever women do love the clever guys!This film reminded me of what I encountered in Phoenix back in the 1980s when I tried, in that voteless era to get various leaders to address and interact with our violated people. They included the Medical superintendent of the Phoenix Community Health Centre (Dr Charles) to a Zulu economics professor from the U of Zululand. Once a middle-aged Indian stood up at a community meeting and proclaimed proudly that he was 'the agent of the National Party in Phoenix' The misguided fool was not lynched. Most of the people at the meeting had lost their homes because of the Apartheid Group Areas Act.Gori Tere Pyaar mein has a rustic charm and a refreshing honesty that should appeal to most people. The snippet I particularly savoured was when Sriram and Dia hurl home truths at each other. They are both from relatively wealthy families and she chooses to devote her life to the disadvantaged; however, at that stage of the story she still lives in her comfortable apartment. Sriram's taunt has her making a full commitment to the people of her country." 
" The Gori isn't worth it, not even for her tooh!","Does Kareena have some kind of sadistic pleasure by torturing her fans? Or can't she just handle the happiness of her fans from last year and thinks it's absolutely imperative to consistently follow-up a great year, with a terrible one? First Satyagraha pakao film, and now Gori Tere Pyaar Mein. Another terribly PAKAO film. No, I didn't have great expectations from this film (it was Punit Malhotra directing it... I mean seriously??) but the promos were rather enjoyable and the stars really did manage to sell their product and entice the audience. Add to that that it's a Dharma Production (Karan Johar makes sure to associate himself with entertaining cinema) and that it was coming off the supremely likable (and one of my absolutely favourites) hit from last year year, with the same jodi and same production house.... I did expect to have a good time. And that's exactly what the stars promised - a clean, feel-good, full-on paisa vasool light entertainer. Well, they all fooled us.Gori Tere Pyaar Mein has been made with honest intentions, but I could care less how noble they felt while making this. I paid 8 euros and I expect to enjoy myself, not roll my eyes until they got stuck up there. This film was reminiscent of those 90s films.... and fair enough, if you want to revisit the past and pay a homage to the (good)-old style of film-making, but for God sake, package it differently!!! This was old wine.... in an old bottle. Even Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani was like a renewed version of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, but everyone loved it.... because it was refreshing. It offered something new. The direction was different, and offered a new perspective. Gori Tere Pyaar Mein fails on many levels, despite a young director, because it lacks punch. The film is devoid of anything that would make you sit up and be interested in the proceedings. And I entirely blame the director and writers here. How could they come up with such a regressive script?? And didn't they have any sort of inclination that things were getting..... really bad.... in the second half?? The whole Bridge nonsense had me fuming :fume: .... to such an extent that I wanted to leave.I just didn't enjoy the film, overall. There were a few good moments. Some really funny sceness/diaogues... and the middle portion of the film, right from when Imran ''sells'' himself (hilarious) to the wedding fiasco (brilliantly executed) to the second half, with the initial village scenes, was good stuff. But the film goes downhill there-onwards and completely crashes. The songs are nice and peppy, but the film doesn't do justice to them. Chingum Chabake pops up randomly, and it's a shame because it's such a good track. I hated Naina, because it was all about the damn bridge. Dhat Teri Ki is Imran's introduction and sets the mood for a fun, zany film (which it was not). Tooh was OK. It got boring. Moto Ghotalo was funny... while Dil Duffer was pointless.Punit Malhotra isn't made to be a director. Period. I'm baffled as to how some reviewers could even say that he's a solid competitor for Ayan Mukerji.... say whaaaaaaaat?? I wasn't much of a fan of I Hate Luv Storys, but that film was overall very watchable, and in my opinion, better than Gori Tere Pyaar Mein (and this says a lot). I know that Karan likes to give complete freedom to his directors, but he really should have stepped in for this one. What a terrible mess he could have avoided.Imran Khan - an actor who has slowly been proving his mettle - doesn't try too hard over here. He's decent and does shine in the sparse comic moments, but is wooden for most part. I have absolutely no clue what Kareena Kapoor Khan is doing in such a stupid film, with such a BLAH character? :hmm: Someone slap me, but she found this more interesting than Ram Leela? Ram Leela was no great shakes either, but that film had so much more to offer, in terms of everything!!! Kareena does well, but honestly, this role doesn't demand anything. Even a newcomer could have done this. After Satyagraha, this is another uninspired performance. I'm disappointed. Chemistry-wise, they look good together, but what a poor follow-up and HUGE let down after Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu.It's good to see Anupam Kher but again, I don't understand why he picked this film? Shradha Kapoor looks stunning and performs well.I've a headache thinking about this film. It was seriously a pakao film... the kind that you watch and mutter '''what rubbish''. I feel like I should stop watching films in the cinema.... This is the 4th time that I've seen a film in the theatre and either disliked it or felt it was below expectations* (Besharam, Krrish 3, Ram Leela*). It was really on the same level as the other regressive films of the year like Phata Poster Nikla Hero, Ramaiyya Vastavaiyya, Krrish 3.... At the box office, this is definitely going to bomb big time. I'd advise you to just wait for an online print. The Gori isn't worth it this time, not even for her tooh. Poor" 
" gori tere pyaar mein is an amazing movie","Gori tere pyaar is a fun movie which has many feel good moments throughout the movie. There are some amazing performances mainly by kareena kapoor, imran khan and anupam kher. The movie gives you a sweet hangover and makes you really watch the movie again. Sceenplay was top notch . All the songs were rocking and peppy. The cameo by shraddha kapoor was brilliant. What was most heartening to see was the brilliant act by imran khan, the guy has really transformed into a much better actor in last few films. The comical scenes were the highlight of the movie with the one with imran khan running from the wedding scene, imran khan and anupam kher fighting over the land dispute, kareena kapoor and imran khan's debate just before the intervals and the scene were shraddha kapoor's boyfriend sings in the wedding. Storyline and direction were also very appealing. Overall a wholesome entertainer." 
" Save time, it's precious.","150 minutes is an overdose of substandard and goofy Hindi movie. The movie reminded me how long Mughal-E-Azam was! GTPM has few comic scenes here and there which will definitely tickle you but an epic 150 min long film is not at all worth watching. The character of Imraan Khan is similar to the one we saw in Ekk Mai Aur Ekk Tu. Kareena Kapoor had one of the serious roles in the film. The only acting I liked was the one Anupam Kher's. Truly, Anupam Kher is a monumental actor and defines the pride of Bollywood. Being a fanboy of Anupam Kher myself, I think that he was the driving force of GTPM. To sum it up, GTPM is not at all a fresh concept for a movie if you have watched movies like YJHD, EMAET etc. Only recommended if you dig Imraan Khan or Kareena Kapoor (or both). Anyways, one may find a lot of similar movies in the new channel "Romedy Now". Not that I am promoting it, but you will at least save 200 bucks!" 
" Probably the most underrated film of 2013!","I have no idea why this film has such average reviews and ratings online. It's got a good story, the film flows well, the actors are all great, the music is fantastic, what's not to like?Kareena Kapoor is adorable in her role. Once again outshining her hero. This role reminded me of her character in Jab We Met - the free-spiritedness and zest for life! She's a go- getter. She inspires an entire community and is so charming in doing so.It's a story about love, life and coming full circle.Definitely recommended if you like Rom-Com's - this is one of the better ones out there. One of Kareena's most flawless performances." 
" Time-Pass!","Punit Malhotra's 'Gori Tere Pyar Mein' is strictly time-pass entertainer, that sums up best as a one-time watch. 'Gori Tere Pyar Mein' Synopsis: A selfish shallow guy from a cosmopolitan city falls in love with a girl, who turns to be a social activist. Fun follows...'Gori Tere Pyar Mein' has a breezy first-hour & a fairly okay second. The portions based in the cities are sparkling, but the portions in the second-hour, based prominently in a village, are plain ordinary. However, luckily, the film never gets boring. The Screenplay appeals in bits & pieces. A stronger second-hour wouldn't have hurt. Punit Malhotra shows marked improvement over his debut film 'I Hate Luv Storys'. He has handled the film well. Cinematography is rich. Editing is average. Music by Vishal-Shekhar is excellent. Performance-Wise: Imran Khan does a fair job. Kareena Kapoor Khan is just perfect. The immensely talented actress displays each emotion with great confidence & control. Shraddha Kapoor is passable. Anupam Kher entertains as the manipulative villain. Esha Gupta sizzles in a song.On the whole, 'Gori Tere Pyar Mein' is watchable." 
" Must watch..!!","A film unlike any other, Bollywood has indeed out done itself this time. Very little romance, hardly any fights but lots and lots of really good catchy songs and fabulous screenplay are sadly not the ideal ingredients for a super hit. The film focuses a lot on the two sides of mankind - the typical narcissist and the one in a million good doer, showcases the struggles the backward illiterate section of India go through because of a few corrupt politicians. The film, before the intermission, is fun and care free with a little bit of typical romantic masala. After the intermission, however, the film takes a more serious documentaried style.Brilliant acting indeed by Kareena Kapoor, Imran Khan and the rest of the cast. Superb portrayal of the culture and weddings of Tamil Nadu. Bottomline - whether it is a box office hit or not, I would definitely recommend you go watch this flick. It is fun, vibrant and immensely thought provoking." 
" Just a bog standard film - nothing special","As soon as I saw the casting of this film, it immediately reminded me of Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu which I didn't like whatsoever, and unfortunately even though Gori Tere is better, it is not that far better. Kareena is a seasoned actress and should seriously consider some more tasking roles. She plays the role of Dia with ease, but her character is just becoming too common and predictable. Imran Khan is getting better and better with every film, and here he delivers a solid performance with some good comic timing, and decent romance with Kareena however he still lacks true hero material! Like, you can't put him in the same comparisons as Ranbir and Ranveer anymore. Shradha Kapoor is pleasant and is very likable in her role. It's great to see Anupam Kher in a negative role after so long and as always, the legend delivers a perfect performance. Overall Gori Tere is just average and nothing more. It lacks real content, and the story is way too predictable. The music is good, which does help the films cause however is not enough to save a sub standard film. My rating of 5 is more towards the acting performances than the script." 
" Takes An Hour To Get To A Point. ♦ 42%","And the film has two-two and a half clichéd points to make. You can only imagine how bad the movie and the cast performance are when the characters themselves are required to enlighten us about who the hero is. Terrible!Not accounting to Punit Malhotra's previous & future blunders, this film strikes few brownie points here and there. The best thing was to cast Shraddha Kapoor as Imran Khan's fiancée and boy, does she do good. Kareena Kapoor, as an aunt figure, is passable. The hero (a bad moniker) should stay away from Tinseltown.As to the story, it has nothing new to deliver. Just an hypocrite environmentalist who travels to make a point just because his ex pointed it out. Then the camera turns to how the good guy tries to woe his girl Friday in front of a village by bridging the gap with a pool bridge by fighting the corrupt state of affairs. Whoa! for the second part of the film, I just stared into the screen wondering why the hell did they make this movie? And when such an expression is born, you know what the verdict is. Poor attention to details, poor cinematography, poor editing.BOTTOM LINE: First part will make you laugh 3-4 times and for Shraddha Kapoor, I rate it 4.2/10. Songs make up 30 minutes and there is not a single reason why you should spend 300 bucks for this stupidity.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESSex/Foreplay: No | Nudity/Porn: No | Violence: Mediocre | Gore: No | Smoking/Alcohol: Mild | Drugs: No" 
" New age rom com meets swades..... But in a good way","Gori Tere Pyaar Mein is a coming of the age rom com meets Swades but in a good way. Punit Malhotra might give the impression in the first half that he is narrating another film on the lines of I Hate Luv Stories, but the second half though still a sweet rom com, takes a turn into the Swades side of helping a poor village. The main story is about Sriram, who is a lazy useless lad. He comes back from America after studying and flirts with girls,parties etc. His parents troubled by him force him to get married. Unfourantley though he likes the girl he is marrying but she loves some one else, and she is too scared to tell her parents. Sriram could care less though he agrees to the marriage,but his wife to be forces him too remember his old love Dia. So on the day of the wedding he runs away to find Dia. She is a social worker, she is in a poor village in Gujurat, and she will only leave the village and go with Sriram if he helps her build a bridge. Does the bridge get built,does she leave with Sriram, and does Sriram change his lazy ways forms the main plot.Acting wise both Imran khan and Kareena Kapoor give nice, commendable performances. They are the films life line. Other notable acts are of Sharddha Kapoor who is sweet and very cute in the film, and Anupam Kher who pulls off the village villain nicely. Punit Malhotra after IHLS comes with a more mature film especially in the second half. He did a good job, and handled the sweet rom com moments perfectly. The music by Vishal and Shekhar is also a big plus.Overall though the films dips at times in the second half, and gets a bit boring at times there the films pluses still out due the minuses. This film will keep you entertained, laughing and you will have a smile on your face throughout the film. Watch if like rom coms, because this is a well made one 3.5/5*"
