" A refreshing movie with real life characters!","Jo Dooba So Paar is a story of Kesu, a young boy with oodles of confidence, as he learns to deal with falling in love and a father demanding that his out-of-school son becomes a truck driver just like him. Jo Dooba So Paar (JDSP) takes you to a small city, this one is set in Bihar, where in the absence of boy meets girl opportunities, love is often one sided. Kesu does not meekly live it down, no young boy does. With not a care in the world, our young hero goes all out to get the attention of his lady love Sapna. Even to the extent of working with his friends to free Sapna from her kidnappers. But not before he is heart broken by learning of Sapna's "firangi" boy friend. Running parallel is the story of Tokan, the constable who submerges his frustration, a job full of compromises and an unexpressed love for Gulabo, in booze every night. Through the movie, silent violence lurks while life carries on. To surface when ignited like when Kesu's father takes out a country made pistol to threaten his son out his Sapna chasing ways. But Kesu is undeterred, wants to fly just like the birds across the sky The editing seems too tight and at places the viewer is left to connect the dots. Like Tokan and Gulabo's love story is almost unstated. It is very evident but hardly spoken about. Similarly while search for Sapna at Bodh Gaya, Kesu and his friends appear to stumble upon the kidnappers without much effort. On the whole, JDSP is a joy to watch. No histrionics here. No masala here. Just solid good entertainment about the "majik" of love. Tokan is a class act by Vinay Pathak. Kesu's lovable chutzpah shines through the film and will remain with you long after you leave the theatre." 
" nicely made",""There's nothing more dangerous than a Bihari in love" "Jo Dooba so Paar- It's love in Bihar", seems to highlight that fact throughout the movie. Anand Tiwary epitomises the gullible Romeo, who falls in love with the firang in town, chases her and tries to win her affection until a sudden turn of events. That's pretty much what the story revolves aroundSo why should you go for it? Well we could start with - It remains true at heart and does not try to be pretentious. The costume design is excellent and all the characters are brilliantly sketched out, right from Keshu (Tiwary)'s strict father, who berates and threatens to kill him on a memorable bridge scene, to the protagonist's gang of pals who hang around and help him out with his affair. They are all very sketched out and believable, and that only lends to the charm of the movie. The score is decent and the script is good with authentic dialogues, borrowing from the regional tongue. You may find the story too simple and possibly it could have done with a few more twists. But that would have taken away from what the director's intent appears to be. Tell it as it really is. On a conclusive note, it is the parts that are greater than the whole and the film will strike a chord with those who wish to explore this new place our cinematic experience is heading to. It will make a place for itself inside you, Go for it, with your Litti-Chokhas and maal puas in tow."
