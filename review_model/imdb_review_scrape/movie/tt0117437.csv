" My favorite masala film of all time...","Some may find Raja Hindustani as the same tired and worn out 90's plot... but I happen to love it. Aamir lights up the screen with a great character, Raja Hindustani, a poor villager who drives a taxi who falls in love with a rich girl from Mumbai.The rest of the story, I'm sure you can guess, as it is very predictable and nothing new. However, songs are really great, and story is captivating.I will say the ending is stupid and Johnny Lever is as annoying as ever this time as Raja's annoying sardar friend. Most of the film I wanted him to drop dead of heart attack. But he never does...But either way this is just a fun masala film with Aamir in the lead. It's not too serious, it's a great time pass and a good love story. If you don't get your hopes up for something mind blowing, you won't be let down." 
" Raja Hindustani","Hello, this movie is one of my most favorite movies ever! I really enjoyed it weather the story, the music and the performance of the actors. Songs like Pardesi pardesi, kinta Sona, ayoho Meri zindagi, also pucho Zara pucho were very popular. Aamir Khan and Karishma Kapoor won their first best actor and best actress awards for this film. Along side HAHK, DDLJ and this film Raja Hindustani were 3 of the all time blockbusters of the 90s. Thank you." 
" That kiss!","This film has all the usual masala elements of Bollywood - the fight scenes, the comedy etc - that we know and love AND one of the great erotic moments of Bollywood. Karisma Kapoor plays the sophisticated bombayite rich girl and Amir Khan the poor man, a taxi driver, besotted with her. They make a great pairing, Kapoor adorably cute and highly attractive (if not classically beautiful in an Aishwaira Rai sense). Khan a fresh-faced young guy and the ideal lead.Most Bollywood movies avoid kisses or they're 'blink and you missed it'. I have watched dozens of Bollywood movies and have never seen a kiss like it...it goes on...and on.The first 45 or so minutes of the movie is a slow burn buildup to the kiss.By the time the kiss comes Karisma Kapoor has teased Amir Khan almost beyond endurance with her coquettrey, in a variety of sexy outfits, like the time she goes shopping in town and changes into a red micro-mini dress and, seeing his embarrassment at not knowing where to put his eyes, teases him saying "You don't like my dress, my dress is very nice".The kiss when it comes is incredibly long ... it times out at around two minutes! For my money it's one of the great erotic moments in all of Bollywood." 
" A pretty good Bollywood entertainer, I don't understand the criticism","Raja Hindustani, released in 1996, was a huge blockbuster. It swept nearly all the awards at Filmfare that year and the actors and songs became a sensation.But nowadays people look back and have begun to criticize the film, saying that it is cheesy, over the top, and stuff like that. Sure, it has some faults, like a typical clichéd Bollywood love story that is up and down, cheesy dialogues, and some quality mistakes. I admit, the story was kind of stupid. But honestly, it's a Bollywood film, so what do you expect. I mean many of Shah Rukh Khan's films have all these things as well, but you don't really see people criticizing those.There were two reasons why I liked this film, and why it entertained me. First, the performances. Karisma Kapoor did pretty good, she danced well, and looked good overall throughout the film. Raja Hindustani also contains one of Aamir Khan's finest performances. One of his underrated ones actually, if you look at it today. He was earnest, likable, he was excellent emotionally, and overall really impressed me. He didn't really overact as SRK does. Besides the performances there was also the music. Who can forget Raja Hindustani's songs? Nadeem-Shravan and singers Kumar Sanu, Alka Yagnik and Udit Narayan did great by singing songs such as Pardesi Padres and Aaye Ho Meri Zindagi Mein. There was also some good comedy throughout the film. Overall, I think Raja Hindustani is a pretty good entertainer, I don't understand why people don't like it anymore." 
" One of the greatest Bollywood films you will ever see.","This has got to be one of the greatest Indian movies you will ever see. Yes, some of the acting is over the top, the first 15 minutes of the film drag before the story kicks in and sure, some points are laboured for Western audiences. However, petty criticisms aside, I keep coming back to this flick year after year as my all time favourite Hindi language film (after Khuda Gawah perhaps). Karishma Kapoor in particular is a real treat to watch - beautiful and intelligent, and above all a very talented and convincing actress. I am genuinely curious that such a breathtakingly gorgeous lady did not make an effort to enter Hollywood or the English language movies at all. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the movie is the fantastic music. Catchy and hypnotic to the point where you cannot really ever forget the main motifs and themes. I can guarantee that even if you don't like the film that much the song & dance numbers will either enchant or entrance. You will never in your lifetime forget the gypsy dance number. Forget the art house stuff and enjoy pure Bollywood at its best." 
" In my top 10 , my top ten most overrated Bollywood movies that is","I saw Raja Hindustani way way back in 96 when it first came out. It was a huge blockbuster and made Karisma Kapoor a major star. The songs became imensely popular, especially Pardesi Pardesi. In my opinion the songs are the only reason the movie became such a huge blockbuster because the story is pretty appalling and clichéd. The story as it is involves Aamir Khan, a cab driver who falls in love with a rich girl who comes to stay with him. They get married but then the rich girl's parents try to cause problems in their relationship and the couple eventually split. The movie's main problem is that it can't decide whether it wants to be a remake of Jab Jab phool kile or Akele hum akele tum and it ends up as an uneasy mix of both. The movie can't even be saved by the wonderful songs. An awful awful movie and the fact that the movie did so well simply astounds me." 
" Evergreen Classic of Bollywood","A textbook Bollywood Rom-Com with enough dose of romance, comedy, drama and some fine acting. Raja Hindustani which till date is Aamir's biggest blockbuster in terms of footfalls will always be one of his most popular movies. Aamir Khan and Karishma Kapoor play their roles well. Both show depth in their characters in the second half. There were some moments which were OTT or the slow pacing of the film, but they can be overlooked upon. Overall, an enjoyable romantic blockbuster of the 90's." 
" Worth it for Actors,Dialogs and script","I liked this movie a lot.I know i made an another but i want to restart.I want to start with negative ones.The comedy was annoying.Veeru,Navneet,Johnny,The kid,Aamir(In a few scenes)were irritating and could have been cut.before the scenes where Karishma scolds Aamir for beating up those guys for criticizing her till that scenes the movie dragged.The very handsome Mohnish Behl is hardly there and could have been deleted.Karishma is less annoying than usual(Meaning she acted immature 2 scenes).Now the good points.Karishma is an actress who i don't appreciate(Except for sexy looks).I say she is overrated.In this movie she gives an amazing performance.The only good performance of her.She sucks big time.Aamir gives an amazing performance too.Archana who has a lot of negative shades in her role does a great job.Others are great too except Veeru,Navneet and Johnny and the kid.Direction is brilliant in a lot of parts.The music ,I LOVED IT.A fabulous musical score.Cinematography is excellent but it gets sloppy in a few scenes.Script is excellent.Pardesi song was a key part in the movie i\which showed the feelings very well."Kitna Pyaara","Aye Ho Mera Zindagi""Pucho Zara Pucho "brings in the feel good mood of the movie.THE MOVIE IS A WATCH.But make sure do fast forward the comedy ones they are annoying and unfunny" 
" Nice to watch","Awesome movie. Nice music. Amir khan acted beautifully.. Karishma is OK OK... All over good movie.." 
" Romance with comedy","Raja Hindustani is one of the best film that Aamir Khan has played in. The film offers very good music, acting and good chemistry. The film has good plot but that could be better and some of the scene needs to be improved. I liked Uddit Narayan's voice on the film (well done for that). The film is like old 80s - 90s romance film. And the film was some good jokes filled in.But the film is worth of while with Aaamir Kahn and Karisma Kapoor chemistry. would recommend it to watch it once." 
" Best film??? Biggest blockbuster?","This must be a joke... Just to make it clear, this is definitely a nice film, and has some very nice songs. But it is just one of those ordinary B-grade films with good-looking actors and great costumes, which lack real story lines. So how exactly did this film win the Best Film Award? Shocking, and simultaneously laughable!Aamir and Karisma did pretty well and Karisma's flashy outfits added some value, but these two did not deserve the Best Actor/Actress awards for this film by any means whatsoever, especially considering the brilliant Nana Patekar and Manisha Koirala, who gave sterling performances in that same year's gem Khamoshi: The Musical, which was the most deserving film to win the Best Film award. This was possibly the most pathetic year in the history of Filmfare and any Bollywood award. It's so sad.The film disappoints big time. It's boring at times, too melodramatic at others. And it's not that I expected to see a masterpiece from Dharmesh Darshan, but you would expect to see a representative of Bollywood's best commercial flicks. It's not even close, and the biggest proof to that is that today nobody really remembers Raja Hindustani as such. We remember Dilwale, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, but this film sucks in comparison.Watch it if you want to have some nice time, but don't expect to see an unforgettable, amazingly special film, or even a particularly good film, because your expectations will be disproved." 
" Raja.... a great film","This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I liked it a lot. I is plenty of good acting roles, music, dance; and the most important i think: "sense", "romance" and "dream". It is true that the film remains to 90s, but yesterday i saw for the first time, and the history was not so far for me. I enjoyed everything. I fell in love Karisma Kapoor again, she is a tremendous actress, her eyes expresses all the history needs. Aamir Khan is a classic actor, the serious and comic scenes are done perfectly by him. What to say about the music? i loved it. PARDESI PARDESI, is my best one. This film, these actors and this music won the film fare awards in 1997. Raja Hindustani is one of that films that will remain in my mind and memory, always coming to give me a good remember. Many greeting from my beautiful Peru. Atte Roberto Guerra" 
" A reminder of the abysmal state of 90's Bollywood cinema","Do not get mislead by those nostalgic fans of Bollywood who refer to 90''s Bollywood as some sort of golden age. 90's Bollywood was abysmal fare and Raja Hindustani typifies how bad it was. Low budget, amateur, formulaic, melodramatic, artless, badly directed, loud, badly acted, bad writing, slapstick. It pains me to admit but RH is Best film material of 90's Bollywood, having won 9 awards for god awful acting. Johnny liver won for acting in a comic role playing the parody of a Punjabi sardar, supported by two jokers playing the parody of a gay man and a tomboy who pass of cheap slapstick as comedy. Karisma Kapoor won best actress for an extremely loud performance and awful acting. Her melodramatic scenes are loud and her attempts at looking beautiful and cute are borderline porn movie standard. There is not an ounce of subtlety or art, every actor is loud, shouts and screams. The characters are one dimensional, unrealistic and seem like they are written by a village bumkin. It's like every character is a parody, but what is sad this is not satire, it is suppose to be serious. Production values are awful, camera work is shaky, colour and print are cheap, lighting is worse than a wedding video, sound effects are poorly dubbed. In general this is a terrible and amateur production. The only respites are Aamir Khan who is able to give life to an otherwise stupid character and the songs are melodious and iconic.The standards of contemporary 21st century Bollywood cinema compared to 90's Bollywood is literally a quantum jump." 
" A Musical treat.","One thing that lingers about this movie is the music, which is innately Indian and the melody is reminiscent of the yester-year Music Makers. Aamir khan who is one of the better actors and Karishma who is easy on the eyes unlike her sister, also happens to be a good actress. There is the usual cast of "Appetisers-side dishes" including Johhny lever, who has better talent doing Bhangra than comedy. This actor has talent with mimicry and impersonation but is a annoying comedian. The Story is a typical Bollywood, where the girl meets a poor boy whose habitation almost always happens to be tourist spot that good looking Rich girls happen to visit. They are invariably are snobbish or the Script writers make them that way till the 23rd reel of the movie to make way for the musical numbers-which just happens to be pure treat." 
" Some good and some bad points","I remember watching this film in the theatres and coming out confused whether I liked the film or not.There were good points and bad points in the film.Good: Finally Karishma Kapoor has transformed from a childish and annoying girl from prem qaidi (debut film) to Sapoot (last film before Raja Hindustani) to a very beautiful and mature women. She moved away from those pink flowery frocks to stylish dresses and sari's.The songs were fantastic and very catchy, especially "Pardesi, Pardesi".The kiss  Although the kiss has been tried before in Vardi (Madhuri and Jackie) and Dayavan (Madhuri and Vinod), this one is something special.Bad: The story is the same old rich boy/girl falls in love with poor girl/boy and rich family is against and conspire to separate them, etc, etc, etc.I didn't feel any chemistry between Raja and Aarti and the story moved quickly to them getting married. It was obvious to see that Raja adored Aarti, but she thought of him as a very close friend and there was no indication that she loves him until they kiss.I'm a huge fan of Aamir Khan, however, I don't believe this film did anything for him, like his earlier films such as Baazi, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander and Rangeela.All in all I will have to say you watch this film for the music and Karishma Kapoor only, nothing else.5/10." 
" A stupid movie i ever seen","A weird same old stories. When will bollywood learn to change their minds. They make millions of movies on same topic. Same old type story a rich girl loves the poor chap. Or they will switch rich boy falls in love with poor girl. Same old stories told again and again. Rich girl played by Karisma Kapoor and poor chap played by Aamir Khan. As always they create situations how a rich girl meets the poor guy and always opposite attracts. The situations are created and they will fall in love and then the parent of rich girl doesn't agree. Always rich parent doesn't agree one person goes ahead and marries that person then what more a step mother, step uncle play tricks. Same junk old stories. Suneel Darshan probably had earned money from that film but its a stupid movie. As far as performance its brilliant by Amir, Karisma and Archana. Nadeem Sharwan music is brilliant. I watched the film just for its hit music. Otherwise its just waste of money. Same old stories retold but they just make different situations and at end happy climax as always. I would give Amir 5 out of 10 and Karisma 6 out of 10. Music is 8 out of 10. story wise its 0 out of 10. Same old based stories. Singers had done their job fine. All movie is just waste of time and if you are fan of Aamir then watch him in Andaz apna apna and sweet karishma in that film. She changed her name so she could get more. Weird people. Watch it if you like bollywood music and dances that sit. darshans makes movies so people can dance only."
