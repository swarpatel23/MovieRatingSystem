" A Good Movie For A Tribute To Those Of The Fifties And Sixties","The title "Khoya Khoya Chand" is a song which was sung in a 1950's movie "Kaala Bazaar" by the late Mohd Rafi for Dev Anand. This is an indication that this movie, by Sudhir Mishra is based during that era - 1950's to 1960's. In fact, in a recent interview, he said that this film was his way of paying a tribute to those in that era.Nikhat, daughter of a well known actress, Sharda, is keen to join the movie industry and does so by learning to dance and catches the eye of the top actor Prem Kumar with whom she falls in love with. She later finds out that he is getting married to someone else, even though he has proclaimed his love for her. This is when script writer Zaffar liberates her from the actor's stranglehold but then events take another turn for Nikhat and she's left alone again.Soha Ali Khan, sister of Saif Ali Khan and daughter of the legendary actress, who herself was a excellent actress, Sharmila Tagore and also daughter of the famous Cricketing legend, the Nawab of Pataudi, has given an excellent performance in this movie. She, also, looks gorgeous. The other cast include Shiny Ahuja, who has also performed well, Rajat Kapoor,Sushmita Mukherjee and Vinay Pathak. The music director, Shantanu Moitra, has set a very good example of recreating the music style of the 1950's and the 1960's and not to mention the jazz genre in it, which makes the songs worthwhile listening to. Finally, the director, Sudhir Mishra, no doubt has created and directed a speciality movie by recreating the 1950's and 1960's era for the screen. Also what has made this movie interesting are the songs that are being played in the background - many of which were, and still are, most memorable tunes from that era. Soha Ali Khan, recently said that her mother helped her with the dressing for the movie. This is not surprising because Sharmila Tagore was a fashion icon at the time as well being a excellent actress of the 1960's. There were rumours that this movie was based on the romance between Waheeda Rehman and the late Guru Dutt,who was married to the singer, Geeta Dutt and who directed movies such as the classical "Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam" and "Pyasa". But the director, in no certain words, has denied this. However, there may be certain parts that some viewers, and especially those of the elder generation, may consider the rumour to be true.Conclusion: Those who like to watch movies from the 1950's and 1960's - a worthwhile movie to watch and enjoy. But those who do not like such movies, or are not very keen on such genres, may not find it worthwhile." 
" Baadalon Mein Chup Raha Hain Chaand Kyon?","Movies from Sudhir Mishra's basket as always stand apart from the rest of the crowd. The subjects he chooses, the characters he brings to life and the way he presents them on the celluloid has always been different. And Khoya Khoya Chaand is no different. This time around he attempts a period movie against the backdrop of the Indian film Industry (I would abstain from using the word Bollywood as I very much doubt if the term existed in 1960's). He takes bits and pieces from the film magazines, scandals, rumours and biographies to weave a plot and base it on the love-story between the writer/director and the actress. Sounds familiar? Well, fact meets fiction and a thin line separates the two. For a novice it would seem KKC is a tale taking snippets predominantly from the lives of Guru Dutt, Waheeda Rehman, Meena Kumari, Nargis, Kamal Amrohi, Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar. And perhaps more, if one were to ask an expert on the subject. As with Sudhir Mishra's movies he infuses the grey shades to the characters owing to which they flesh out very much true-to-life. ם Shiny Ahuja:: Does a good job. Its evident that his character loosely inspired on the life of Guru Dutt and perhaps Raj Kapoor.ם Soha Ali Khan:: Quite a matured performance indeed. Her character has many layers and safely manages to deliver the goods. I am sure the inputs from Mum must have helped.ם Vinay Pathak:: Initially you feel the actor is wasted in a pathetic character, but in second half the character gains momentum.ם Rajat Kapoor:: As usual dependable. ם Sonya Jehan:: Extremely pretty however her performance seemed very plastic. The set, makeup, songs, dances, costumes (and even the telephone ring) transport you into the era of 60's. Everybody who has contributed to the movie deserves to be acknowledged for the valiant effort. KKC is not Om Shanti Om, the goody-goody glorified industry, it is not Bollywood Calling, the dark satire and neither Luck By Chance which portrays the industry from the struggler's perspective but yes - it belong to the same genre. It does not shy away to tell the darker side of the industry and attempts to realistically portray the picture behind the iron wall without being derogatory. The movie caters to a cross-section of audience hence there is hardly any room for commercial or wider acceptance." 
" A Tribute To Hindi Cinema Of The Mid Twentieth Century","Sudhir Mishra's 'Khoya Khoya Chand' is his tribute to the classic Hindifilms of the 1950s-1960s which is considered the golden era of Hindi cinema. It takes at the behind the scenes looks in the lives of actors, writers and filmmakers. It's not a voyeuristic satire of any sort and though one might notice the references from the lives of Guru Dutt, Waheeda Rehman, Dev Anand, Madhubala, Meena Kumari and even Hollywood stars like Dorothy Dandridge and Marilyn Monroe. The characters themselves are not based on any specific person. The title is derived from a famous song (of the same title) from the 50's film 'Kaala Bazaar'.I liked Mishra's attention to detail both as writer and director. The costumes, props, colourful sets, mannerisms of the actors, choreography, the popular classic songs playing in the background and hummed by the actors, contribute very well. The art direction is just superb. Shantanu Moitra, recreates the whimsical jazz style of the 1950's and the 1960's which add to the atmosphere. Cinematography is solid, especially the long shots.The characters are very well written. Even the supporting characters have a strong presence with little screen time (of course credit goes to the actors as well). Even though the film moves at a slightly slower pace than one prefers, there are several standout moments such as the exchange of glimpse between Nikhat and Ratanbala when Prem Kumar's engagement is announced. Nikhat catching Zaffar red handed with Ratanbala, the bond between Shyamol and Nikhat after Zafar's departure....and many more.Soha Ali Khan is a bit inconsistent in the beginning but she embraces the character as the film proceeds. Perhaps a more experienced actress would have been more suitable for the role. Nonetheless, this is her best performance after 'Antarmahal'. Shiny Ahuja is brilliant as the tormented Zafar. Rajat Kapoor is a scene stealer. Ditto Sonia Jehan who is wicked, seductive and vulnerable as the sensual Ratanbala. Vinay Pathak is sublime. Sushmita Mukherjee and Saurabh Shukla provide some comic relief.'Khoya Khoya Chand' was a visual treat for me and seeing current actors in this period piece made me feel as though I too had moved back in time and was watching a movie sometime in the 1960s. It might not be a film that adhere's to everyone's taste but it is a wonderful film to watch." 
" Chand Khoya Nahin........","It is inevitable to bring in the reference of Sudhir Mishra's previous film,"Hazaaron Khwahishein Aisi" , when one sits to ponder over KKC's relevance today. Like his previous film, KKC is also set in a bygone era, a time that boasts of being the "golden" age of Indian cinema, HKA was based set in the most turbulent times of Indian politics(well...it's turbulent now too), but both films have struck the right chord as today's audience could identify themselves with those in the films.Coming to Khoya Khoya Chand....whatever I had gathered from the trailers and reviews of the movie....everything was very discouraging. But after I saw the movie ,I did not get up from my seat for a good few minutes.I agree with most people , who have taken it to be their sole ambition to slander the movie and the filmmaker, that the story has been told many a times before....but I doubt whether it had received such a palpable treatment.Sudhir Mishra should be solely championed because of the characterization of Zaffar, Nikhat ,Ratanbala ,Shyamol ,Noni Ganguly....But I guess the best one's that of Prem Kumar's. With a stroke of artistic brilliance, Mishra has asserted the fact that, nobody wants to harm anybody-they just want to pursue their own interests, but if you stand in their way, well only a few would spare you to be busted out. That's how the world rotates on give-and-take policy. The director creates many cinematic moments and the language of the camera is impeccable. The performance are flawless ,to say the least , and every actor- be it the main leads or the supporting cast ,they have done a brilliant job. The scene in which Prem Kumar's engagement is announced , the broken,cheated look on Nikhat and the compassionate look on Ratanbala , who too has been cheated, superbly portrayed by Soha Ali Khan and Sonya Jehan.The flashback scenes of Zaffer's troubled life in Lucknow, the look of shock and despair on Zaffer's face when he returns from London, only to know that His beau Nikhat was married to his best friend as she needed support in the brink of her downfall, Zaffer's father praying for forgiveness , Zaffer caught by Nikhat making love to Ratanbala and the look on their faces, the drunken brawl of Zaffer with Nonida.....I can go on and on and on.Rajat Kapoor is marvelous as the talented,charming,sly, opportunist, compassionate , wicked(yes , he is the most humane of all characters, neither fully good nor fully bad)superstar and Sonya Jehan is a good find of Mishra's(she only did a "Taj Mahal" before)as the seductive , fussy, actress, cheated again and again in love. Her portrayal of Ratanbala reminded me of the penpicture of the lonely moon in Shelley's "To the Moon",filled with a sense of nihilism. She is the Khoya Khoya Chand in my opinion. Soha has delivered her best performance till date and Shiny like always delivers this time too.Sushmita Mukherjee, Saurabh Shukla and the actor playing Nonida,do justice to their characters but kudos to Vinay Pathak's Shyamol,Zaffer's friend , repenting every moment of his marriage to Nikhat and to see her suffer.Superb.The impact of the film keeps haunting you for quite sometime. The music resonates in your memory long after you have actually ceased to hear it.And you can still hear someone saying,"Zaffer, Ab To Mauff Kar De Yaar"(forgive me now at least) or "Pata Hain Tum Apne Bap Se Itni Nafrat Kyun Karte Hon??Kyunki Tum Jab Bhi Apne Andar Jhankte Hon To Unhi Kon Paatein Hon"(do you know why do you hate your father so much?because whenever you reflect upon yourself, you find him)" 
" A movie for the movie connoisseur.","An excellent movie... wonderfully directed,with excellent characterization, screenplay... The story of a person as he realizes his naivety and attains maturity through the course of his life is depicted through the character of Zafar, the cinema industry of the fifties being an excellent backdrop. One can see how life is dealt with, differently by different persons as we look at the distinct personalities in Nikhat, Zafar and the superstar Prem Kumar. As we are taken through the movie we get a glimpse of the movie industry in the fifties in the perfectly made settings, giving the impression of an excellent classic in the current times." 
" khoya khoya chand.... not so khoya hua","'khoya khoya chand' prooves the amazing skills of the director sudhir mishra. although the writer sudhir mishra may still need to work a bit.the movie style is amazing. the story being set up in the early 60s is amazinginly displayed using all details of the era. from wooden badminton rackets to clothing...... each detail has been taken care of.the art direction and special effects also need an applause.the first half of the movie has great dialogues and great story. the second half seems to be a bit stretched.after the awesome movie ' hazaron khwaishien aisi', one expected an 'unexpected ending'. although the end could have been arrived earlier than it did, it was still 'unexpected'." 
" A two hour drivel","It is difficult to fathom the minds of Indian directors - what drives them to create period movies with stories that are still relevant in 21st century. Whether it is Vidhu Chopra's "1942 - A Love Story" or Sudhir Mishra's "Khoya Khoya Chand". With too much focus on recreating the past, the story takes a back seat and as a result, the movie fails to impress.Time to time, Bollywood keeps making movies about itself - mainly the struggle for new comers and its dirty ongoings, right from Guru Dutt's "Kaagaz Ke Phool" to Zoya Akhtar's "Luck By Chance" (Best among the crop being Hrishikesh Mukherjee's "Guddi"). Sudhir Mishra takes one step further - he makes a movie about 1950's Bollywood. He tries to cram everything into a story - new comer struggle, casting couch, art v/s mainstream cinema, etc., etc. But while putting so much efforts to recreate that "magical era", the story, the dialogues and the character development takes a back seat. The result is just a movie that seems to be going nowhere.The movie centres around Nikhat, an actress, played by Soha Ali and Zafar, a script writer/novelist/director/producer played by Shiny Ahuja. The movie centres around the ups and downs in their relationship, and between other characters along a time period. However, crammed with corny dialogues, annoying stereotype characters and clichéd situations, the movie drags right from the start. After a while, you just don't care what happens to the characters. Inconsistencies and loopholes are galore. Since the main characters have a Muslim background, it is customary to speak "khalis Urdu" and observe that "tehzeeb". However after few scenes, all that mannerism seems to disappear in thin air. The height of ridiculousness comes when to show her alcoholism, the director shows Soha Ali in a car parked on Bombay street side and Soha enjoying a glass of hooch.The character of Shiny is supposed to be some kind of deep brooding, which he plays to an annoying extreme. It reminds me of similar character played by Akshay Khanna in "Dil Chahta hai". But speaking in a slow baritone voice doesn't make you an intellectual, it just makes you look a phony.This movie somehow reminds me of Scorsese's "The Aviator". In "Aviator" however, with emphasis on recreating past, the director did not lose focus on the basic element for a good movie - a strong solid storyline. With "Khoya Khoya Chand" however, no such hope exists,sadly. The only positive aspect that I did not spend any money to watch this drivel, a simple walk to public library is all the effort that I put in watching this movie. I still gave 4 starts to the movie, as there are still movies that are worse than this and are still popular and made big monies at box office." 
" An excellent classical entertainment.............","I was always excited to see classical films, showing royal and grandeur of palaces, old machines, slow pace of time, the natural way of action and the background score and hence, when I watched the trailer of Khoya Khoya Chand, by Sudhir Mishra, I got interested. Yesterday,I saw the movie.My first expression while coming out of the theater, was WOW! and it really is interesting my friends, to see something a revival of the classic without blindly copying the classic. The movie is directed by Sudhir Mishra, who has a fine taste of classical elements, and the movie shows his hard work and keen efforts to bring to us what we used to have in the past, while retaining the contemporary essence to it.The movie is set in the 1950s era, showing the events associated with stars and people associated with bollywood! It is basically about a young girl Nikhat(Soha Ali Khan), who is a junior artist in bollywood and dreams to become an actress some day and till now she has been working as a side dancer in some sequences. She has to face the dark side of film industry and is determined to do so. Prem Kumar(Rajat Kapoor) is a super star, one whom directors are willing to make movies with and actors willing to work with. Also, he has an image that no artist can stand in front of him and deliver his dialogue with retakes. However, the super star is attracted to actresses who worked with him and therefore, Nikhat who's always willing to be in limelight comes to be his new attraction. There begins Nikhat's career in the film industry, when Zaffar(Shiny Ahuja), a young, talented poet, actually a story writer, from the families of Nawabs, comes to Bombay.He does not believe in any limelight, pomp or show. Having a troubled childhood, he's a hard nut to crack, his emotions do not easily come out, but when they do, it sets the stage on fire. The fine sense of direction by Sudhir Mishra, actually takes us to that period and one, which lacks in Indian Movies normally. Last I remember, having seen Rand De Basanti, where to depict a feeling or an emotion, the director used a different set up all together and left the audience to understand what he wants to convey by the set. Its the case in Khoya Khoya Chand, rather than actually showing everything happening, the director has, in between tried to give a hint or show whats to be understood.Shamol(Vinay Pathak), a fine actor plays the role of an assistant director to big directors, and is a friend of Zaffar. He takes Zaffar, into the film industry to try his fame as a script writer, realizing Zaffar's talent of writing. He is liked by everyone and there comes his first meeting with Nikhat. They interact, chat, work with each other and eventually begin to like each other. Nikhat, however continues to work in the film industry but slowly gets frustrated with the people around. Even she had a troubled childhood, and the thougths of which, disturb her sometimes. The movie also features Ratnabala(Sonya Jehan), who's a beautiful actress and has risen up the same way as Nikhat has. The role has been played extremely well, of a greedy, jealous, young woman, however I do not remember seeing her in any of the movies before this, But she's a fine actress. Slowly Nikhat and Zaffar come close, which is not liked by some people. This gives rise to various differences in opinions, arguments. The second half of the movie is mainly focused on the relationship between Nikhat and Zaffar. Both having achieved an acceptable position in the film industry, work in somewhat different fashion according to nature and interests. Zaffar would want Nikhat to do as he tells her to, but this would not happen. There begins a cold war, a kind of separation, both Nikhat and Zaffar have to live with. However, this does not last long. Nikhat has achieved name and fame, but is she comfortable with her life, satisfied with the way things are coming to her.Is she happy without Zaffar in her life.The dark world of film industry clings to her feet, she's no longer happy and becomes a frustrated spoilt actress, her career drowning. She no longer can work properly, every time either her personal habits or her past comes in front of her, just when Zaffar comes into her life again........But its too late now, for she has now in herself something else except Zaffar and has to abide by it. Thus, the story of Nikhat, an actress who is both in the good books as well as bad records of people, is portrayed.The background score is like old movies, use of traditional musical instruments, slow music, colorful sets, classical dancing sequences, all of which makes us like Khoya Khoya Chand. However, the movie seems to be a collection of events grouped together and therefore, every scene seems to be like an act or a scene in a play. Maybe it has been done intentionally, for in movies of the past, we normally see events like stage plays. It is a complete entertaining package, one of the best movies of the year, definitely an award winning movie. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10 for excellent performance by all the actors, good music, good plot, story line and extremely well direction. Do watch the movie, you'll surely like it." 
" Loved it","Khoya Khoya Chand did not get great reviews and I do wonder sometimes whether professional critics are always fair.Anyway, I saw the film just now on TV and I loved it. The dark plot with several shades of interesting grey was most engrossing, keeping me glued to the screen, commercial breaks notwithstanding.The star cast was superb and they all did justice to their roles. Shiny was brilliant as Zafar. I feel sorry for Shiny Ahuja who's film career is over due to much publicised reasons not necessary to go in to here.Soha was a young Sharmila Tagore reinvented, she really is a carbon copy of her mother! Vinay Pathak, Rajat Kapur and all the rest were very very good. The costumes and period settings were wonderful as was the cinematography. I really liked this movie.There is no need for me to repeat the story here, suffice it to say that this is a most enjoyable movie and well worth a watch for those who have not already seen it. Khoya Khoya Chand surely deserved a better innings at the box office." 
" Disappointing","Disappointing, to say the least. This movie doesn't even come close to Hazaaron Khwaahishen Aisi. This was a movie with so much potential, but Sudhir Mishra's apparent self-indulgence makes it almost painful watching in parts. Khoya Khoya Chand was never meant to target the commercial audience, but I doubt many people will be able to appreciate the plot, especially the second half. It is a movie that tries to celebrate itself without achieving an iota of greatness.Shiny Ahuja is brilliant, as usual, and Soha Ali Khan tries, but her role demanded someone more expressive, like Vidya Balan. The performances though are completely negated by the story. The last half-hour is a tragedy, both in the movie, and for the audience." 
" Kahani Kho Gayi","Expectations that were never met - that is the sad story of Khoya Khoya Chand. Who would think that the man who gave us the mesmerizing Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi would now try to foist this film on us? This is a story of a greedy grabbing star actor, Rajat Kapoor, playing yet again an oily villainous type, the vulnerable and abused actress, Soha Ali Khan playing Nikhat, the dreamy idealistic poet, Shiny Ahuja playing the novelist/script writer. There are casting couches, there is crude (sorry, blunt) language, there is simulated sex with lots of oohing and aahing while clothes do not come off, and there are interminable scenes of films being shot. But somewhere along the line the filmmakers lose the plot and forget that in this collage of events they are also obligated to have a thread of a story. There is the thinnest of tales and unengaging at that.The movie is visually stunning, an excellent period piece, also interesting for how it hints at real life stories like Guru Dutt and Waheeda and those countless women who were sent to earn a living in the biz at a very young age. The direction is sub-par, in the multitude of bodies milling about the key elements are never really isolated well enough, and the leads are quite wooden most of the time. Rajat Kapoor is great, as is Vinay Pathak. Sonia is quite good too. But Soha and Shiny disappoint hugely. In the hands of a more experienced pair of actors this could have risen to greater heights. As is, this is no Kagaz Ke Phool, but rather Kahan Hai Phool.The music is mediocre (except the title number) and the sound is one of the most annoying parts of the film. The director wanted realism in the form of the hustle and bustle of a real set, but what we get is a background of cacophony in every scene, so much so that it is hard to hear what is going on. The story moves in fits and starts. The leading lady suddenly develops a hole in her heart, and the director has to go on blogs to tell us that the final shot is her orgasm! What the fish? Then we are told the rest of the tale in a written narrative - as if we cared by then what happened to this tepid tale." 
" An attempt to visit film-making in the 60s","Khoya Khoya Chand - Its an attempted journey into the film world of 60s when writing was an important aspect of films and many writers became directors of their movies. The ambiance of the 60's film industry is captured rightly to some extent as its all mostly indoors and vintage cars. But the film does not impress and fails to make an impact. The viewer does not relate to the happenings and cannot feel anything for the characters. The story has its plots pointing towards the life of Guru Dutt & Gulzar. The script till the interval seems like pieces joined together. It only gets its grip after the interval but till then the audiences have lost hopes. Its as if we are watching a well made documentary on how the films were made in the 60s and how the artists related in their personal lives. After seeing the flick one is forced to believe that the casting couch existed in the film industry long time back too and everybody had illegitimate relations around them. Performances wise Soha Lai Khan tries her best which shows from her effort but she look too young and immature to play the role. Her act is satisfactory but she lacks the depth demanded by the script. Shiny Ahuja is impressive but gets loud at some places. The best act comes from Saurabh Shukla as the punjabi producer and he looks superb and very enjoyable. The music is good but doesn't have any memorable song. Only the title song scores the highest among the all.Overall its an average movie with insights on the Indian Film Making System. But surely much more was expected from Sudhir Mishra who gave us "Hazaron Khwaishen Aisee" & "Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin"Ratings : 2 Stars (Go for it if you want to take a look how films were made in the 60's)" 
" One of the Best Hindi Movies","The vintage, the color, the sensuality, the acting, photography and the music-Oh the music..by Moitra, is spell binding, so much so I saw this movie about eleven times and the music never ceases to enchant me like music of "Evita". Shantanu Moitra has incredible handle on the musical instruments and he is the latter day R.D.Burman. The two actors stand out with such glee. Rajat Kapoor and Soniya Jehan are credit to Films. But Soha's acting is so pure and subtle with little nuances (like "Nighat" shaking her head to the directors instructions-so typical of Indian gestures.) This movie has an intricate and innate beauty like "Mai Madhuri Dixit" but the credit should go to Mishra for directing and Subash Jha for producing and putting together this incredible cast. This movie is what movie making is all about. Soha Ali Khan and Shiny Ahuha have pure magic and old fashioned romance. This movie should have gotten awards for Best Film, Best Direction, Best Acting (Soha), Best Music and Best Photography. I know this movie was shown at Palm Springs Film Festival but was hardly noticed by the media (these Mumbai chamchas who have no class or taste. These bums are busy wiping the bottom of the Three Scum maggots who are put on pedestal by cheap front benchers who are the kind who spit in the theaters)"
