" Sad to see such an effort being made without any proper directions.","Watching a project such as AZAAN makes me sad because it is a perfect example of a misguided venture backed by a strong resourceful will of making a good film. It can easily be compared to a game wherein a person is holding a bunch of darts ready to hit the target-board. But after he throws them all, he finds out that where some less important ones have rightly hit the bull's eye, the other most important ones have gone far away from the main circle.Explaining the example given above, AZAAN has few great merits which should have essentially resulted in a fine movie. Like, it was marketed well and talks about a fresh subject of Bio-terrorism (spreading germs or viruses to kill a large number of people) which has never been exploited by any Hindi Film before so prominently. As required by the international plot it gets full support from its fabulous cinematography, brilliantly capturing the action sequences as well as its various world locations taking the viewer onto a multiple country tour. Plus it gets a very well composed & arranged background score which adds to the thriller aspect of the film perfectly along with few pretty decent tracks in its soundtrack like "Bismillah" and more.But all these merits become worthless in absence of the right kind of script, pace and performances required for such a project. In other words everything goes wrong in the film apart from these few points, sadly resulting in a poor show altogether. The director Prashant Chadha takes all his inspiration from the famous "BOURNE series" and other films made on the similar subject, but is not able to bring the same kind of excitement in his own film. The script goes on unimpressively, from being predictable to complicated travelling from one continent to another in fast cuts. Moreover the writers don't ever care to explain the concept of Bio-terrorism to the audience and take everything for granted. The romance factor looks like deliberately added as usual and the thrilling element is surprisingly completely missing in the film based on Global Terrorism.In the performance department, Sachin Joshi has got the looks but he actually doesn't match the vast scale of the project. He still needs to sharpen many aspects of his acting including his dialogue delivery. From rest of the cast Ravi Kissen tries hard but everyone else gets nothing written for them specifically in its weak script.On the whole AZAAN unarguably shows all the big money spent and many sincere efforts put in to convert it into a big success. But unfortunately its just like the case of constructing a fine smooth road towards a wrong direction. And it really makes you feel sad watching such an effort being made without any proper directions." 
" bad just bad","AZAAAAAAN.....at least to a politically incorrect person like me this Muslim call for prayer to the devout sounds like a terrible call for jihad that reverberates across the ages......Images of gun-toting men attacking my hometown Mumbai or planting bombs elsewhere and masked terrorists creating mayhem in Kashmir or Chechnya flash through my mind......Thats what I went to the movie for--to see the heady cocktail of Islam , Kalashnikovs , violence and terrorism.....But lo.....Azaan Khan is actually the name of a RAW agent , a MUSALMAN DESHBHAKT.....And what is the task set before this Muslim deshbhakt ?? It is to save the country from biological warfare--a deadly strain of the Ebola virus that China has spread across the country to kill people in millions.....And to do that he has to go get a girl in Morrocco whose blood has been inoculated by Dr Maifooz ( another Muslim deshbhakt ) against the virus before he was killed by the anti-national forces . Replicating her antibodies in laboratories will give India the cure to the Ebola infection .But to get to her and save his country Mr Azaan Khan will have to fight against the agents of those who want to destroy India--dangerous mean people who have high tech weapons , and whom Azaan has to counter with brains and brawn..........And counter them he does.....In the bhojpuri accented English of his RAW handler (actor Ravi Kissan )--He faaught like a lian against aaal aaads But while countering them he has to fight against turncoats from his own RAW agency who are working for the enemy , and against his own younger brother Aman Khan the Muslim deshdrohi.....But one word about this maha Muslim deshbhakt......why was such a wooden , expressionless actor chosen for this lead role ?? For he is an actor who is not able to show any emotion even when his mehbooba ( some firangi actress ) dies in his arms , ending a brief and tragic romance..... What hold does he have in the film industry that he was chosen in spite of his obvious incapacity to act ??The fight sequences are the only somewhat interesting part of the film , but even they are mitigated by the hero's ( Sachin Joshi ) expressionless acting......In the end the hero saves the country at the cost of his life.....and I really wish he's dead so that I don't have to see him in more films in the future....As far as YOU are concerned......you don't have to see him in this film too..........For I am not recommending it to you.....Verdict--not good....." 
" Things are quite simple : Best Cinematography, Best Background Score; Worst Acting, Worst Screenplay!","Azaan is an attempt to make a spy action thriller of Hollywood echelon and makers have partly succeeded in their job. The movie is shot exotically, and seems polished but misses out the real thrill element of an action thriller. Thanks to very poor screenplay, a viewer is never connected with the movie, and thus enjoys this stylish odyssey at a superficial level only.Sachin Joshi isn't apt choice for this movie. The actor, who is also the producer of the movie, is unfortunately, a big letdown. If he would have casted some veteran actor of Bollywood and invested good amount in publicity and marketing, and the movie would have turned a money making machine for him.Unfortunately, one of the most expensive movies of Bollywood (precisely 180 crores) will flop without notice of the people.I can easily summarize my experience of Azaan as follows.Good: Cinematography (arguably, the best that Bollywood has even seen) Background Score (Undoubtedly, the best that Bollywood has heard this year till date) Novel theme (biological warfare and undercover agent concept)Bad: Sachin Joshi's performance (and strictly okay performances from veterans like Dilip Tahil and Sajid Hassan due to scare scope) Scattered screenplay (probably the worst one for such a tight-edited movie)Nevertheless, I will watch this movie again, just to hear the background score by Salim – Sulaiman." 
" It's different. Definitely for a Logical crowd.","Aazaan by far the worthiest film I've watched all year. Being a movie buff i try and catch all movies not being subjective . The same goes with Aazaan. Its all you can expect in a great movie, action, romance, thrill, excitement, commitment, loyalty, speed! Its got great commitment to entertainment, thrill to excite the audience, loyalty towards each movie goer's preference, thus compacting all the good stuff moves in one movie. Its a whole package with a little for everyone. Its kinda like a box of chocolates...its just my way of expressing my joy of watching the movie!! But don;t take my word for it!" 
" Aazaan is a must watch!","Aazaan. Have you ever heard of an Indian Spy traveling the world in micro seconds to save his country? Well Aazaan Khan is one such spy who travels the world, eradicates terror, finds out the answer to his confused life. Aazaan's mind-blowing cinematography, background score and the pace made me hooked onto the movie till a certain point which I wouldn't disclose as it is for you to find out. No, its not after the starting credits roll, can assure you thatStory- Aazaan Khan's parents were killed by a terrorist. Aazaan then takes revenge by killing them in his childhood. Seeing this his brother gets infatuated. He helps a terrorist group which is on a mission to kill India biologically. Aazaan by now is an Indian Spy, who wants his brother to return to the track of goodness and to finish terror. And as you know any Bollywood movie won't get over within minutes, Aazaan couldn't see itself behind. During his mission he meets Afreen (Candice Boucher) and her kid (Zara) whose blood works as an antidote for the Ebola virus. Aazaan and his quest to get the antidote, finish terror and bring his brother back from the hands of evil is what Prashant Chadha had to tell. No getting into further details here.Acting- Sachiin J Joshi has done a decent job as a debutant. Yes, polishing is needed in wide areas but has done justice to the role of Aazaan. Dialogue delivery and performing stunts was well accredited. Candice Boucher plays a sand artiste. Her presence is felt only for 15 minutes in the movie which makes her role unexplainable and gives out the impression of her character being forcefully added in the script. My favorite was Ravi Kissen who has done a tremendous job in the film. Both comic timing and getting the seriousness was superbly balanced. Other actors have also done well for their minute roles.To concise, Aazaan has a good blend of magnificent music and background score, credit to Salim - Sulaiman. Excellent cinematography by Axel Fischer brings a whole new paradigm to Bollywood film-making. Prashant Chadha's vision and the screenplay played a vital factor in keeping viewers hooked onto the movie. Yes, at some part it might just put you off but stunts and action are well portrayed. Regardless, go watch the movie only if the tickets cost Rs. 80 or Rs. 100 max. I'm not guaranteeing you all anything par excellence.My ratings- ***" 
" Craving hard to watch Action, the answer is Aazaan.","Just saw the movie and I've to say it's an outstanding movie. I have seen Mission Impossible and Bourne Identity series and then to watch this Bollywood flick is something more than appreciable. I had to write a review for this movie because I'm just in love with the movie. The action sequences, music, acting and definitely the ACTION is mind-blowing. By now hopefully you should get a jist of the potential of the movie. Indian spy, amazing directing skills, beautiful cinematography and definitely mind-blasting background music to support each scene makes this movie a must-watch for the season. Guys, this diwali there is just another reason to celebrate, Go and watch Aazaan if you love Action genre from the bottom of your heart." 
" Pretty good.....but can it work?","Quite simply, Aazaan is meant to be an action thriller, and it does live up to that genre top some extent. Story is about a RAW agent Aazaan khan, who is sent to find the mastermind behind a deadly virus that is killing people around the world, who is also believed to have the cure. Aazaan also has been given the task of finding his missing brother who is believed to be linked with terrorists.The concept is weak-something that people nowadays are not very interested in.The editing is poor, for some scenes there is audio video mismatch(poor dubbing). Most actors are cheap. They should have used some standard actors. They have also tried to use the remarkable BOURNE type of action in this. Some scenes move too fast.But some of the action scenes in the movie are remarkable. So are the various locales where it was shot. Sachin Joshi does a good job. Songs are pretty good. You can watch this film. But perhaps if it had released at least 10 years before with a few FAMOUS actors, it would've done better." 
" Aazaan - Wonderful, Gripping, best Hindi - Hollywood styled movie ever !!!! Must watch !!","I was trying to see it for a long time., Finally i made it today. For all those movie lovers its a must watch movie. People...you must watch this movie as it has got nice storyline. All though story gets loose here and there but it keeps you on the edge till the end. Best part of the movie is background score (I'm a frequent listener of Aazaan's songs)Awesome job by Salim - Suleiman and Salim merchant is awesome as usual for his songs. I wont forget this movie for one thing., Its expression less acting of Sachin (which was a turn off at times) but i'm sure he'll grow much more mature and good at his acting. Counting on you Sachin!! All N All, good movie. Love you all for reviewing this movie before me. Love you all movie lovers !!!!!"
