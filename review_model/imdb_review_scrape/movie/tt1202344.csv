" For god sake - "Enough"","i spoiled my last night by seeing it......totally useless movie. unnecessary violence ,, irritating acting ,, awful background music, Diana was dumb...............just one word for the movie - - - - - - "Enough" - the direction, camera and background score are worst.this movie falls short of expectations, mainly due to the gaping holes in the plot.the movie's weak link was it's story. i will go 1 out of 10 for this worst ever movie. I have only one request to the movie makers... Please don't waste money on stealing the scripts and filming them, you can rather dub the movie in Hindi and put some songs at end and it will work just as fine..."
