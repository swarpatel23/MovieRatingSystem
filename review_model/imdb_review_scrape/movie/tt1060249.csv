" Save yourself","I totally disagree with the earlier comment made about the movie. I think its probably by one of the movie promoters. Drona is easily one of the worst movies in Indian history. I would never downgrade a movie but in this instance I feel obliged to save other people from watching an awfully terrible movie that lacks originality. From Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings to Heath Ledger role in Batman. They have copied everything and in the end come up with the worst movie. Even the music is pain to the ears, the location crap, the computer graphics too fake, the costumes a shame to the Indian film industry and finally an acting worst than first time auditions." 
" This years Razzies topper!","Dear Goldie, I know you or one of your agents will read these boards to get feedback on the film. So I am addressing this to you personally.Let me summarise my personal sentiments for your film: it made me cringe, it embarrassed me, it made me laugh at it's stupidity, not a kind of good laugh, more of a laughing with disgust. I was also very bored and waiting for the film to end. Had I not been watching it with family and friends, I would have walked out.As I am talking to a director I am going to give you feedback on each aspect your film fails on and and suggestions.STORY: I read in your interview on how this story was so special to you. Perhaps you should have submitted your script to a script doctor before submitting to your producers. It seemed like it was your first draft It was one of the worst scripts I have had the misfortune of seeing recently and I nominate it personally for the Bollywood Razzie awards. Your whole setting is fake and unconvincing; none of your characters are developed; the story is not thought out. You know I seriously got the impression that what you did was watch a few dozen Hollywood fantasy films, pick and mix whatever you liked and made a collage, not a film.All you did was lift the common Hollywood quest story for immortal elixir, plastered Indian names on it, and called it Indian. Riz Razada seems like a reject from a c-grade Hollywood film. Everything about him, his look, his mannerisms, his lair, his henchmen are completely foreign.Your super hero is a moping loser. The first thought that came to my mind was when I saw your superhero was, "No, seriously, this Cinderella-man is the superhero" but I gave you a chance. I figured you were going for the loser realised hes special plot. In actual fact it turned out into the superhero with special needs plot. In the beginning he is looked after by a flower petal! He is saved by a woman who has more testoterone than him; in the later parts he turns into a mommy's boy who gets walked over left, right and centre and in the end he get killed - oh and then saved by a dues-ex-machine with him suddenly coming alive again despite being impaled by a sword.Your superhero was pathetic. A passive pushover that just grunts and makes ugly faces, and to make matters worse looks absolutely ridiculous in his costume, displaying Mr Bachchan in the most unflattering light. He never actually earns any credit as a hero - let alone a superhero.DIRECTION: If your screenplay deserves a Razzie, so does your direction. You totally destroyed the film.The excessive and monotonous use of slow motion. It became so frequent it was predictable. Every time the hero appears, cue slow motion and take several shots from every angle of the hero posing with his sword raised making angry faces(which is what the hero ever did) Tacky costumes and sets rejected from a Hollywood film. I don't think you even thought about how UGLY and fake the sets and the costumes looked. They were also very boring and empty. I wondered where were the people in your film, and when you had people such as Rizada's fans, you made them look ridiculous too. Then we also the ridiculous Gandalf-caricature in the end. I know what you were thinking, because it is a fantasy film you can go all-out with the bizarre, but this just betrays what an amateur you are. A fantasy film is not an excuse to make everything look ridiculous. That only reveals your lack of thought that went into making film.SPECIAL EFFECTS: The special effects are as crude and underdeveloped as everything else in your film. You should have at least got this right, this was your trump card. At least you could have won the tag, "Great special effects, awful film" instead you win the tag, "tacky special effects, awful film" What is worse that despite having such tacky effects you flaunt them. The beginning with Rizada cloning himself looked like it was from an 80's film. The electricity effects looked laughably out of date. Perhaps you should have consulted the SFX technicians on the other Bollywood turkey Love Story 2050, they at least got the electricity effects to decent standards.The car-chase scene with some cut-in shots of a CGI car looked like they were from an older racing computer game.The particle effects looked like they were the test version of The Mummy. The sand storm faces in particular were very crude.Other graphics look decidedly video-game graphics.You said the special effects had been in post-production for a year and you hired Hollywood technicians. Then why do you such sub-standard results? Did you lack the budget, the experience, the software? Somebody is going to have to explain why the effects were so substandard. Again, why did you have to lift special effects? What is wrong filmmakers of your ilk? SONGS: I am not going to say too much, they are like everything in your film, awful and misfits.ACTING: Well, you might have actually destroyed Abhishek Bachchan and Kay and Kay's acting careerIn short Golide, don't be surprised if you are nominated and win for nearly every category at the Bollywood Razzies this year. A really pathetic film that would have been rejected by virtually every Hollywood producer even at the script stage. Bollywood producers are going to have become more discerning. Nobody wants to watch such rubbish. I doubt you will get funds for a sequel, this franchise is not going anywhere." 
" Drona will induce a lot of Rhona...","...because people will be questioning why they had wasted 2+ hours on this snooze-fest. It is the most boring movie to come out this year. Thank God for giving man the brain to invent the fastforward buttons. The film overuses slow-motions to the extent that even in fast forward mode, things move slowly. The action sequences are pathetically executed and the special effects are tacky (to say the least). Goldie Behl is clearly proving to be one of the worst directors. Abhishek Bachchan wears only two expressions: that of looking clueless and that of...well, to quote a friend, think of a child who just had his toy taken away after which his face reddens before throwing a tantrum. Yes, that's the title character. Jaya Bhadhuri looks as though she really dreaded being a part of the movie and only did it for baby Bachchan's (who's trying to look like a man) sake. Priyanka Thopra acts like a zombie. She's supposed to be this action heroine who wears no expression and does the occasional item-number type dance. The only reason why I bothered with 'Drona' was because of Kay Kay Menon who's one of my favourite actors. I did enjoy his over the top villain act but the character is too much of a caricature. But I'm still thankful for the fast forward button and if the slow motions were reduced to normal speed, the movie would have finished in a good 30-45 minutes...and it would still be boring as I have experienced. Plus, the songs deserve to be fast-forwarded too. The ridiculous ending promises a sequel but I hope the film bombs badly enough to avoid any further torture." 
" Most Bakawas Movie of the Year","This is definitely most boring movie I have seen till date. Though Bachchans are having legendary status as far as acting is concern,but they don't have eye for good script,often miscalculate the effect of script, Drona -very good example of misjudgment by Bachchans.It is said that each and every movie signed by Abhishek first approved by his parents(Amitabh&Jaya).On paper story looks interesting,thrilling,action-packed but on screen its just opposite.Only positive point in movie is Priyanka Chopra,she leaves her mark by strong performance.In acting Abhishek is very poor as alwayes. For Abhishek acting means blank face with minimal or no dialogs(I think he learned that from Ramgopal Varma in SARKAR). Yet he has to learn the facial expression in front of camera.Its better to watch "Krissh" forth or fifth time than wasting money,mood & weekend on Drona" 
" worst movie of all times!!","To those folks who haven't watched this movie....please do NOT watch this movie. The thing which i do not understand IS that why do Indian directors lack the vision and imagination required to make a fantasy movie!!! I can't even give the movie some credits for a nice attempt because a decent attempt would have resulted in the movie ten times better then this one!! ZERO IN ACTING...ZERO IN COSTUMES...ZERO IN ANIMATION..ZERO IN ORIGINALITY..and the sets look so artificial that even a 2 year old can tell the difference.There should be an option of rating 0/10 on IMDb,b'cause this movie deserves a BIG 0." 
" Confused and uninspiring on the lines of TASHAN & SAAWARIYA","It can be called the game of destiny or the Karmic circle that some people get all the resources, the backing and ready setup to make a huge movie and from the inside they are not the masters of the medium. On the other hand there are immensely talented people (directors and writers) who have all the potential of delivering a Hit but they never get a chance of proving themselves. Here destiny plays more important role than talent, I suppose. Why I felt this way after watching DRONA ? Here is the answerÂ…If we take into consideration the budget of DRONA and instead of making "Drona", we spend that money on 10 different small budget films giving break to new talents, then I am sure all the 10 films will come up with something interesting. A few may be exceptions, but they all will be able to recover the cost and may also generate profits by selling all kind of theatrical, satellite and digital rights.But spending such amount of money on a dull, uninteresting and poorly executed project like "Drona" is out of my understanding. In fact in my opinion if any intelligent businessman would have seen the rushes of this movie half way, then he would have decided to shelve the project right there. I am a loyal Bachhan fan, but I feel sad to say that this is the most deadly or the worst choice of project from Abhishek Bachhan. May be he relied too much on his childhood friend Goldie Behl, the director of the movie, who could not deliver the goods for himself and his friend.Drona simply fails to generate any kind of interest right from the start. You can feel the restlessness, the giggles and the noises in the theater just after 15 minutes of the movie. There is no definite plot and it keeps on dragging with costly and well executed digital effects. Interestingly all the special effects seem to be inspired from the "Mummy" series movies. The sand storm, the faces in the sands all look familiar. Abhishek tries to give an intense performance but doesn't have a well written role for him. Both the writer and director seem to be confused in what to make, a fantasy movie, a super hero movie or a super girl movie.The annoying fact is that Priyanka Chopra looks more convincing and gorgeous in her super girl get-up than Abhishek as Drona. May be the film would have been far different and better if it was made around Priyanka as a super women. Jaya Bachhan has nothing to do in few scenes she has got, but as always she looks elegant. A complete mis-cast is K.K. in the role of evil villain. He tries to be funny and cruel at the same time but fails to impress. For the first time I felt K.K. was not doing his part with full spirits. The script has not got any mention of a special time period. It keeps on shifting to different time spans with sudden jumps ignoring any continuity. However I made a keen notice for the work of Art Director. The fantasy sets and the mysterious city set in the second half was so childish, in bright colours like newly painted and was clearly visible that they were made out of cardboards and stationary materials. The sets were not impressive at all as compared to the special effects. Musically, nothing to mention as all songs were uninspiring and unwanted as per the script and demand of the subject. In the first half the songs disturb rather than entertain. Only a night before, I heard the people from the Industry praising the movie at its premier in Mumbai. Now after watching it, I can only come to a conclusion that Abhishek has not got good, sincere and true friends around him. If there had been a true friend then he would have told Abhishek straight, that this is your latest grand mistake of making a wrong choice and please don't rely on it. Forget it as soon as possible. And I can bet that Amitabh, Jaya and Aishwarya, all being intelligent & experienced film personalities, knew at the back of their minds that this is not gonna work.Last Words : The only worth watching thing in Drona is, the fight sequences by gorgeous Priyanka Chopra in a well suited get up." 
" One of the worst movie bollywood have ever seen.","It is one of the worst movie in bollywood history. The movie never seems to catch the grip of the audience.Poor storyline,poor animation,poor make-up. Very poor performance from all except kk menon. Music is also poor and songs doesn't even suite the situations. Only title song is OK. Somesets in the movie like they have shown a secrete city is too poor andlooks comedy. Many parts are exaggerated. The movie starts with a boys living with family and was given trouble by aunt.he is unknown of his powers which he got from generation to generation.villain needs nectar.and only drona can find that,who saves that from many generations. And after many puzzles both villain and drona reaches to nectar.and then climax starts where villain stabs drona and after that also he wakes up and kills the villain. The slogan of the movie said 'get dronafied' & you will be dronafied(terrified) actually. Overallvery poor movie and not even worth watching it once." 
" D - RONA..... and only RONA","firstly I would like to recommend IMDb- the site to have separate rating scheme, where films such as this can be rated in negatives.my plot - On an unfortunate evening, I decided to watch DRONA. God what wrong had I done for you to not stop me? Well as fate would have it I went ahead and bought a ticket for this master piece of a film. To make it worse i made a friend of mine to travel 4 hrs in traffic to come and watch this movie with me.we went in with no expectations. i don't like to go cinemas with a fixed head. i like to let the film surprise me... and yes it did... Fortunately I missed the first 5mins of the film. The film began with terrible blue petal flying into a house, a stupid kid fooling around with it and an uncle who only has a cameo of few seconds. Of course you remember the spider-man and his old man. this uncle does not say much and gladly dies soon without any significance of any kind. Cruel aunt and mean cousin brother are incharge of Drona's life. Priyanaka Chopra is secretly protecting the so-called protector of the universe.One day and damn foolish magician finds that DRONA is alive and he has the access to ELXIR. But before the magician can find Drona... Drona has to find himself? how philosophical? he figures out that he is a prince of some ruined land in India and he has a mother who is dressed distastefully as it can be. He father died of getting drowned and he is now responsible of saving the elixir from getting into wrong hands..The magician comes and exploits the maa beta angle. the Drona decides to give him the elixir for the life of his mom. now how brave is it ?and then a whole lot of confusing and frustrating events happen. in the end Drona kills the villain.... are we expected to be surprised???Acting was the worst... i think AB Jr can take acting coaching from Himesh. Priyanaka, looked neither hot sexy or ugly... KK... poor him.In all the film is a total humiliation of the audiences. Making movies such as this film should be considered terrorism." 
" Please don't make that sequel!!!","Believe me - if you want to see some cool effects, or you're a die hard Bachchan-fan, or you love Priyanka, or some stupid actions, go for it. But if you actually want to see a movie, prefer Kidnap.I caught the first day second show, right after watching Kidnap. It disappointed me. In the starting, you feel like it's going to be a good ride. But the factor of impatience takes place as you realize that NOTHING'S HAPPENING!!! Believe me, the dude doesn't even wear his Drona suit till 15 minutes after the Intermission, and the first half is wasted in him actually believing he is Drona. His legendary sword reaches his hands about in the last 20 minutes of the movie. Surprised? Well, no actually. We have seen this happening in Love Story 2050, but at least the performances are better. Nothing more.A well deserved 4, 2 for effects, and 2 for the acting. Abhishek, why were you so pepped about Drona? Go watch Kidnap, I swear" 
" Drona Disappoints!!!!","Yesterday even after being such a bad weather in UK, my 5 yr old daughter dragged me to Cinema to watch Drona. Me, having read the reviews already, wasn't expecting much but being a fan of Fantasy adventure deep inside, I let myself to be dragged to the cinema, paid price in UK Pounds and also victimised my innocent wife as well.What do we get in return, My favourite Abhishek, Priyanka and KK as actors and supposedly a fantasy adventure, Which could really have worked if handled properly by a worthy team and not by an amateur director who is Abhishek's childhood friend and suddenly he and Abhishek decide to make a film with sword fights etc (They actually said that in an TV Interview) and make the audience the actual scapegoat. If bollywood still thinks that Indian audience is just a bunch of dumb asses, Please think again and again ...So I was saying, What do we get in the movie, Abhishek, who looks completely disinterested, his eyes looks like he had just woken up and hadn't had a bath since his childhood avatar. Jaya ji, who doesn't look at all like a beaten up lonely widow woman but more like a plump and expressionless queen, Maybe Rakhi is perfect for such roles (Mere KAran Arjun aayenge type.). Then we get K K Menon, a Perfect actor, but what he is doing here. The character he was playing, Riz Rayzada, wasn't just the worst character he ever played but the worst villain as well that bollywood had produced. If anybody still remember Joginder, then even he was much better. Everything related to Riz Rayzada , may it be his looks, his antics or his kingdom, looks so bad, it actually creates a new definition of bad. We can say that only good thing was Priyanka Chopra, as she looks good and more confident and played her character well.Movie sets, may it be Raajpur or Villain's layer , they looks sooo cheap, that even TV serials are doing better these days. The quality of action is another thing to talk about. There was a complete lack of imagination. Except the last sword fight, all the other action sequences were so badly done and confusing, I hardly have any words to explain that. You just know that OK now action is happening but actually nothing great is happening on screen, even the train sequence, that looks good in trailers, was a big big let down. They flaunt about Indian martial arts etc in promos but actually you didn't get to see even a single fight showing clear martial art moves.Special effects were nothing great but they were OK for Indian standards as definitely we can't compare what we see in Hollywood movies with their mega budgets. But again, some of them could be better.Overall, It was a big joke of a movie, which make me now like Tashan, which at least have KAreena's bikini show. I would request Bachchans and producers that now Indian audience is not only Rikshaw wala, chai wala etc but now a big share of Indian audience is an educated lot, who knows the difference between good and bad. I think even I could have done a better script and direction, compared to what Goldie Bahl did. Please don't take Indian audience for granted and produce quality stuff and it will give you good results." 
" Drona = Rona","A combination of a terrible film, sleep deprivation, my drivers holiday (Eid) and a couple of beers forced me to walk out of the film within 25 minutes. I had the same kind of foreboding within 5 minutes of the start as I had in Love Story 2050. The story, dialogue, acting, characters were all so terrible, poorly drawn out, stereotypical that I just couldn't bear to watch this one fully I walked out just as Kay Kay, who plays the villain, was introduced and hearing his hammy dialogue proved to be the straw that broke this camel's back. Subsequently, my wife, brother, mother etc watched it fully and assured me I did the right thing. Even the two points are only for the special effects that I didn't see (copied from a slew of Hollywood adventure films) and for Priyanka Chopra (who's entrance also I sadly missed).Apparently Goldie has already decided that he's going to do a sequel. He may have trouble finding someone to bankroll it this time. Sorry for copping out, but I took instinctive evasive action just as a batsman instinctively dodges a bouncer to the head.More reviews at Apurvbollywood at blogspot." 
" Real Bad Movie","After the failure of 2050 Love Story. I was expecting the directors in Bolloywood wouldn't dare repeating mistake. But this one, to amaze me, went beyond all the limits of flops.Abhishek, could not act, as he must have forgotten or director had strict warning for him not to act. Lot of things in the movie has no direct or indirect link to the main story.Priyanka Chopra, I pity her. She did same mistake after 2050. But never expected from Abhishek to act in such movie. Well, everyone makes mistake. This was big mistake though.I heard, The villain was overspent for appearance. But seriously it was the worst role he must have done. Too much over acting and too much non-sense.Dare not watch alone." 
" The AAG of last year","This is seriously Chota Bachchan's tribute to his dad's disastrous TOOFAN(1989) The film is a mix of Cinderella and HARRY POTTER and makes no sense Suddenly it's shifted from a city to a desert Suddenly comes Priyanka to save Abhishek the truth of the Drona is a sleepy bore Even the mother- son scenes the romance everything is so dull, lifeless It makes KRISSH look a classic Seems like Bachchan wanted to compete with Hrithik hence this was like a way to satisfy his ego The film also looks like RUDRAKSH another terrible movieGoldie shows no progress since BISKH Abhishek keeps a bored look throughout, his look too is bad Priyanka is monotonous Kaykay overacts and resembles Amrish Puri from old films Jaya is bored" 
" Worst script..worst story..worst direction..","The movie has no Plot. I very bad and dull story line. Very bad direction. Waste of computer graphics. Untimely songs, which will make the audience sick. A super hero movie without a single super hero action. And worst than a TV serial or cartoon. More over the actor abhishek with such a caliber should never committed for such a role which should be performed by some serial artist. The story,if published in some action comics also may not be standing in its feet. Please don't waste your tie seeing this movie. Go and eat a happy meal.. Please give your sugesstion to others, so they don't waste there time and money to see this !@#$" 
" Total RUBBISH!","What is this crap? Everything is so awful, especially the direction. They could have made this movie ten times better if they spent some more time on it. The actors don't even deserve credit. What a horrible acting! The cable guy could act better than Abishiek and Pryinka.I could not tolerate this movie. I rented the DVD from subzi Mandi, the $2 DVD's you can rent. Well, i wasn't able to tolerate 2 minutes of this crap. I just turned of my DVD, and watched good old Jaane To Ya Na Jaane ( The second movie i bought from Subzie Madi, and my favorite movie). Good thing i didn't watch it in threatre. Pay 10 dollars to get in, but still my TWO DOLLARS WATED. TWO DOLLARS I WORK HARD FOR! I will give credit to this movie for special affects. They are not up to Hollywood's standard, but brilliant for Bollywood. I was impressed with that but thats about it.NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE ITS BAD AS TERRORISM!" 
" The most boring and uninteresting movie to be made in Bollywood","I agree with the person below, I wish IMDb would allow us to give negatives for movies such as Drona. My mom and I decided to watch the movie and were quite looking forward to it, too, what with all the hype over the film in the media. The beginning was okay; it wasn't spectacular or attention-grabbing, but I decided to give it a chance and stick it out. Boy, was THAT a mistake! Within the first ten minutes, I was struggling to pay attention and follow the story.Everything about the movie was totally disconnected and there are many things that are left unexplained. The acting was abysmal at best: Abhishek Bachchan and KK are laughable at best. Jaya Bachchan is about as realistic as the stone statue that she turned into. I'm giving this movie one star only because of Priyanka who actually looked pretty good, although even she failed to deliver in certain areas. The CGI effects (if you can call them that) were absolutely childish. The scene where Riz Raizada clones himself is confusing as well as amateurish.Everything about the movie seems fake and poorly executed. It got so bad that I actually fell asleep! Not much of an achievement for a so-called "action flick", eh? Overall, I wouldn't recommend it even to my worst enemy. It is truly a movie made to bore the audience senseless."
