" Govinda please stop this","First of all Raja Bhaiya is fine movie with funny jokes but one thing i totally hated about this movie was huge age difference between hero and heroine. Govinda is currently 45 years old and he is pairing with 20 years old girl. I like Govinda, he is good actor and my whole family enjoys his movies and they also enjoyed Raja Bhaiya but in whole movie seeing a middle age man dancing with a teenage girl made me sick. I think some mature heroine like Ravina and Karishma are more suited with Govinda and i cannot blame Aarti because she is new in field and she has to do what producers tells her to do.In end i only say that Govinda is a very talented actor and he should stop appearing hero against young girls, just like Jackie Sharoff who is now doing many matured roles and looks great. I don't want to see Govinda ending up like Mithan." 
" Liked it","I liked the movie very much.  If he can still keep up with the dance moves. I dont see where there's a problem.  To still be active at that age. I think its great.  There are other entertainers.  That are even older that can still keep up with the dancing.  So I dont see what that has to do with anything.  I thought the movie was cute and funny."
