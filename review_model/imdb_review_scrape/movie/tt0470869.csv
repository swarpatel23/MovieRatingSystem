" Modestly entertaining sex comedy","A sex comedy from Yashraj Studios! This film flopped at the box office but it's watchable. The jokes are juvenile and sex-obsessed, probably ideal for naughty fourteen year olds. Uday Chopra is alright but sometimes annoys. Tanisha gets to strut her stuff but is an average actress. There are plenty of hot bodies and eye candy for both sexes. There's a specially sexy number "Halla Re" that may get you moving. This film probably isn't worth a visit to the theater but it's perfectly watchable at home as long as you are comfortable with sex jokes and innuendo.Overall 5/10" 
" do not waste your time!","What a crappy movie! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in Canada, yet he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday look gay in this movie? Also, do all the chicks in Canada dress like sluts? At least that's how it is in this movie. All the females are dressed like strippers. Don't waste your time with this one! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. Wonder why Bollywood is going through a slump? It's because of movies like this. I miss the good old' days when Hindi movies were actually entertaining!I couldn't even finish this movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood needs to stop trying to replicate the style of Hollywood because it's just not working out. They need to stick to their roots because that's what makes Indian movies entertaining." 
" terrible movie!","I really wish bollywood would stop exposing their actresses and start writing some GOOD stories. The problem with this story is that there is no story to start with. A horny young man of Indian origin from Canada decides to have his share of sexual escapades before his wedding to an Indian girl from India. He goes on a 21 day trip to Vancouver to satisfy his perverted ideologies. There he finally succeeds to get girls under the covers but is always prevented (coincidentally?) by another Canadian of Indian origin. She dresses like a prostitute and decides to help him sleep with other girls. In the end, they realize that they are truly made for each other - and not for the other 100 girls he wanted to have sex with. Sad story, sadder costumes and no morality whatsoever. Tanisha seems as horny as Uday. When will bollywood understand that we don't watch bollywood movies for its sex but for its stories...if we wanted to watch movies for 'steamy scenes'. wouldn't we just go for Hollywood?" 
" not worth it","It is definitely not worth spending either money or time. It is the same hackneyed plot of a guy and a girl meeting and falling in love. But this is with a western touch. But it fails miserably in either depicting a love story or giving it the western touch. Never do we feel that the hero and heroin are in love. There is no depth to either of their characters. Probably, with a better cast, some justice could have been brought about to the characters. Finally, it is a movie with no fun, no acting, no theme, no plot, no comedy , no action, no thrill, no romance (i associate romance to something more passionate). Definitely not a movie you would want to go with your family. Overall, if you are looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. I shall wait for the day when bollywood movies are something that i can wait to watch and i can refer to my friends as a "must watch" movie." 
" Disgusting, degrading and humiliating towards all women!!","The most disgusting, degrading piece of crap ever to be made in the history of Indian cinema! What were Yash raj production thinking! Just tits and arse all the way through. Worst acting ever by a leading duo ie uday-tanisha. Both should give up on acting instantly and try another direction in life. Would not waste money even seeing it on pirate DVD. So be warned do not waste your money on this rubbish. 1 point for the music which is a million times better than the film. When will Bollywood filmmakers wake up and realise that the story is the most important part of a film and not just the look! No wander people laugh at our films if we continue to make these pathetic, souless so called 'films' If you want a good film that has a DECENT STORY,SCRIPT and ACTING watch WATER instead!!Just my two cents" 
" Simply awful!","I did have some expectations from this film because 1. It was a Yash raj production 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed catchy 3. The star(??!) cast was new. Well, I must tell u that I just couldn't sit through this movie. Uday, (with his red lips-what were the make up artists thinking???!) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably. I won't even get started on his acting (if u can call it that). 'Cleavage queen' Tanisha with all her screaming and ranting n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration. I think Uday was slightly more tolerable than her! She seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister. The story is pathetic...the same old tried and tested formula. Absolutely no originality. There is nothing worth watching in this movie. Makes me wonder why it was made in the first place!" 
" Super entertainment!!","NnN is quite possibly the world's worst film--and also the funniest. The only thing better than a good film is one so bad it falls right over the other side into greatness. I enjoyed every painful, awkward, un-self-conscious, enthusiastic, ridiculous, out-of-touch SECOND of Neal n Nikki. My friends and I have had a Neal n Nikki Nite three times already. If you want to be TRULY entertained, please see this film. Also, for such a stinker, it has a great soundtrack.. The bad songs are enthusiastic and cheesy so you can't get them out of your head and end up really enjoying singing them (Neal n Nikki; Amanda; I'm in Love), and some are just genuinely good (A pretty girl from Bhatinda; Hallare; Anakh Lariye). This film is a gem." 
" when was the last time i wanted to run amidst a movie","Yash Chopra movies- the flavoring was long lost. Story - I was not expecting anything fresh. Direction - Refer to the first line. Cinematography - How much can you rely on the background to take you through hours of ruthless time killing!Tanisha is too loud and exaggerated to thicken a weak plot. Uday Chopra is more than just disappointing.Pre-marital sex is an over-talked issue which went looking too naive for the duo to pull it off well. Everything else about the story is too repetitive and too clich√© to make any prominent difference to the movie , which starts stumbling in the first few minutes.Songs seem to have been hummed too much. Lyrics are not worth getting tuned.If there is any high point in the movie, may be its just the scenic beauty but then i would rather pay a hefty amount and visit Britain than spend hours watching a sad attempt at romance!The freshness and the feel good effect of the yesteryear Yash Chopra mushy flicks have lost their color and charm in the crowd of new comers expecting the costly sets and the music set up to help them climb the ladders of fame!It doesn't work anymore!" 
" Neal N Nikki is Good! but i understand why people wouldn't like it","Neal N Nikki was shot in Vancouver B.C. ( that is not why i'm partial to the film) but it does shows Vancouvers Radiating beauty.The film itself needs to be broken down in order to be appreciated.First of all this film is NOT for the old generation of Bollywood film goers. To translate this into a Hollywood comparisons it would be American Pie meets a love story.Secondly the acting is terrible, but the roles are so unique that i couldn't think of other actors to pull it off. Tanisha and Uday create believable annoying roles, but they slowly by the end of the film find a place in your heart where you can understand where they are in their life. I thought Tanisha was annoying at first, but by the end i realized that i for the first time knew a character not an actress. The reason is I know this is not how Tanisha acts on her day to day routines, she filled the role of a perky 20 year old well.Third, the songs are brilliant. Yeah i agree that the film presented them a bit weakly;however, the songs are amazing. A great fusion of west meets east in i'm in love, Neal n Nikki is the most kiddiest song but is hummed almost immediately after the film is over, ahk ladiya is a fantastic Punjabi song, and halla re has great music. I thoroughly enjoyed the way they parodied old Indian movies in "im in love" thus proving that this movie is for a new generation.So if you can over the taboo dialouge, and cheesy but cute plot line, Neal n Nikki is naughty and nice!!! I loved it, cause of it's character..it was definitely not run of the mill..and thats why i liked it." 
" Why doesn't Uday just retire.....This movie sucked","Neal N Nikki is voted on of the Worst films of the year by Planetbollywood. Its hard to believe the famous Chopra's have produced this lousy movie. It was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. Nor does it make you laugh, but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm the Neil, I'm the man, rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors ever with no acting talent. After making many Super Flops, and not receiving any movies from a producer rather then his Family. He gives a total crap performance, that bores you to death. Tanisha, who is and will always be known for being Kajol's sister, gives a dreadful performance. Both actors have the most annoying chemistry, and are very immature for their age. It has a special appearance by the very cute Richa Pollad, in a pathetic role. The ending was so daft and stupid, I cant believe i actually paid money to rent this crap." 
" Skin, flesh, Barbie dolls and whole load of daft antics in Canada..","Wow!!!! we are supposed to believe that this is the coolest movie ever!!! The streets are lurking with perfect Barbie dolls dressed in next to nothing and daft boys looking to score. In this case the extremely annoying Uday Chopra and the equally if not more annoying Tanisha. Thank god this movie is not your usual three hours long and runs like a B-grade run of the mile romantic comedy. Hollywood's full of them. Saying that this movie is quite entertaining, and you can get a good laugh but for all the wrong reasons. You may not laugh at the jokes but the silly and likely probability of half the things the two get to in this movie. And finally some decent kissing in a bollywood movie. Which I gather was to lots of attract audiences but then again the two stars just don't seem to gel. there isn't any of that overly deep and emotional love we have become accustomed to. There's no tears no deep eye contact nothing? In fact very flat in places. on the plus the photography is nice and the songs bearable. Okay movie nothing to really shout about." 
" Highly unrecommended movie","This movie is very modern and forward. It is about 75% in English. It is aimed at English-speaking multiplex-going young audience. Basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average.Unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking shots of tequila about 5-6 times in the movie. The director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. All through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work, at a beach or at a wedding. The heroine of the movie doing this makes the youngsters feel this behaviour is acceptable.The less that is said about failure of Uday Chopra doing Shahrukh Khan's DDLJ role of arrogant girl-chaser, the better. The movie is about equality of sexes. But equality should not be about making the same mistakes, instead about doing the right to do the right thing. If men have been shown as chronic Casanovas in movies, does not mean women should also portray same behaviour.Even though the movie is made in light-hearted fun spirit, it promotes so many wrong social notions in the name of being forward, that "fun" part of the movie makes no impact. Not even in Canada women dress like this, or guys behave like they have shown in the movie. It is certainly not a reflection of Indian society or even Canadian society. Perhaps they should have a disclaimer at the beginning stating, "All characters and events in the movie are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film." The only good thing about this movie is the length, 1.5 hrs, thank god." 
" why, Yash Raj, WHY!?","Oh my god, WHY, did I waste my precious time on this film? It is pathetic, waaaay OTT and unrealistic, and one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Yes, MY LIFE. I am embarrassed for Yash Raj films, the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible film.This is by far, the most, trashy, sexual, eyebrow-raising movie I have ever seen by Yash Raj Films. I cringe for them, I really do. Along with the terrible acting (or NO acting, for that matter) by Uday Chopra, combined with the lack of talent of the "Look At My Boobs" Tanisha, Neal 'n' Nikki has not one good thing about it at all. Even the music is not upto the standard left by YRF. The director, Arjun Sablok, did an embarrassingly bad job here.Honestly, I expected more. Much, much more." 
" Neal N Nikki - Stupid yet enjoyable romantic comedy","Boy meet girl, boy hates girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy engaged to girl's sister, etc. etc. etc. We've seen it a million times in Hindi Cinema. But usually, the boy and girl are traditional, goody-two-shoe perfect Indian beings who spout about tradition and culture and damn the west. Well, not in Neal N Nikki. Neal and Nikki make out and have sex. Basically, anyone expecting traditional Indian entertainment aka Yash Chopra's hit from 1995 Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge will be sorely disappointed. Ten years later, he makes Neal N Nikki, the anti-DDLJ. These two are so out there, if they ever met the lead pair from DDLJ, Raj and Simran's heads would explode! I enjoyed it better than Salaam Namaste. Completely unpretentious and fun. Moronic and utterly stupid at times, but pretty progressive the way it looks at sex and the love lives of twenty-somethings. Uday Chopra is an SRK wannabe who needs to get his own style. We have too many guys trying (and failing) to pull off the arrogant "cool dude," and Zayed and Uday are NO SHAH RUKH KHAN. Even when Shah Rukh tried to act like a stud, he still came off as dorky, which was charming. These guys try way too hard to ape his style, but really seem to believe that they're the next best thing. Sure, Uday has muscles and height but is a terrible actor. He has no depth, no range. His lipstick also distracts. Tanishaa is mediocre, but shows some sparks of Kajol. She did a much better job emoting in Sarkar- here, she went over-the-top in some scenes. I believe if she goes light on the make-up and tries to restrain herself, she'll do better. She's not one-tenth of her sister in terms of talent. Kajol could go over-the-top without hamming, or could overplay a role and make it look charming and spastic, aka the beginning of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Tanishaa is a wannabe. A toned body is the last thing an actress needs (Look at frumpy, but talented Kajol). Still, she's funny in some scenes, especially the "Are you a virgin?" conversation. Richa Pallod follows the trend of her costars and is neither all that attractive nor talented. She's bland in that Shreya Saran, Ayesha Takia, Bhumika Chawla kind of way where you wouldn't be able to pick her out in a crowd of extras. Clearly, gone are the days when actors and actresses were actually unique, instead of talentless star kids (We're looking at you, Kareena/Esha/Zayed/Fardeed/Tusshar) or cookie-cutter supermodels with the same personality (If you replaced Priyanka with Lara in a movie, would anyone really notice?). The music was enjoyable too, and the locations were nice. Gorgeous cinematography and a polished product. With stronger stars, this one could've been better, but as it is, not bad. If critics can digest the turgid Salaam Namaste, which I found disappointing in spite of mammoth expectations, they should dish out some compliments for this one too. Granted, I had low expectations from this one, but not bad! Pretty fun! Don't think about it and enjoy the candy floss airhead romance. 7/10." 
" Excellent movie, watch the DVD!!!","This movie takes place in Beautiful British Columbia in the city of Vancouver. Vancouver is ranked the third best city to live in the world. This movie captures not only Vancouver, Oliver and my favorite city Victoria. The title song takes place in Victoria...I love that song. There is a scene at the Camosun College (I went there, the best two years of my life) I believe not to mention Bastion Square and Victoria's scenic inner harbor. I hope more people decide to holiday in British Columbia. Vancouver is a wonderful diverse city. That is why I am proud to be Canadian and very lucky to be surrounded in a multicultural environment. The world comes to Vancouver there is no need to search for anything. Neal and Nikki was a cool and hip movie. A friend commented on how Nikki looks Italian. Also many of my friends saw the actual shooting. The actress who played the lawyer actually talked to a friend of mine. Blenz is another popular coffee chain besides the obvious Starbucks. I just got back from the VPL (Vancouver Public Library) where that particular coffee shop is...and I read a back issue of Filmfare (march 2006 and I read a bad review of this movie). That is what prompted me to write this!!! In defense of Neal AND Nikki. Many points to make...First of all like every Hindi movie has stereotypes and this one is no exception but there were a lot of truths in this movie. One general is that all girls liked to be serenaded too, that takes a lot of guts. Another truth is that people deal with breakups in different ways...Nikki's was drinking while the Lawyer had relationships on her own terms. This is Canada and you have a choice. The most general truth is the Punjabi stereotype of Nikki and her cousin. The last song with all three of them was nice, it was so funny when Neal tells Nikki he is going to make her dance at his wedding. They were both so stubborn. As far as exposure all actresses have been exposing, normally people do not walk around here with their navel exposed even in the summer. When non Indians watch some Indian dancing they blush, for me it is common way to dance because I grew up watching Hindi movies and English. I have learned to appreciate foreign films from the friends I have made from different countries who come to Canada for school etc... Nikki looked cute not vulgar. Neal looked hot. Uday has been working out and it shows, it showed in his first movie Mohabbatein. I saw that in theaters in 2000. All the songs in the movie are catchy. The director did an excellent job it is too bad that some people do not appreciate Canada. Vancouver is Hollywood north, I know actors that will be famous one day! Vancouver is always being made into America (as in Pardes). Pardes was shot at UBC, the part where she is giving her speech about "I love my India" At least in this movie Vancouver was given its due credit. The movie was awesome enough said." 
" Cute 'N' Cool Movie","It is a great movie. I've been wondering why it didn't work that well. It is a fun, light-hearted, happy, cheerful, fresh movie. It is a real fast moving cute film. You'd never find it dragging and boring. It contains the element of subtle humor. It doesn't have nagging irritating characters, melodramatic scenes, unnecessary emotions, unnecessary violence etc. Even the climax of the movie, when Nikki is suppose to stop the engagement(thank God, not the final grand wedding), the story has a funny twist, unlike all the other movies where there is lots of crying, sacrifice, and blah blah blah..... The places where the movie is shot are really beautiful. The music of the movie is brilliant. It sounds very new and original. I has a touch of Punjabi + western + Indian classical + something like Arabic (I think). And of course, not to forget the choreography; which is also superb; fresh and decent, simple and elegant. The movie is overall decent. Decency is not about the clothes of a heroine in a movie. It is about the way she is portrayed; and I don't think Tanisha's role in the movie is reprehensible. Even the kissing and sex scenes are not picturized in a dis-respectable or vulgar manner. Another thing I don't understand is why people are complaining about the movie not being realistic. Why should a movie be realistic? If they wanted to see realistic practical things, they shouldn't be watching movies at all. They should be watching documentaries and news instead. Movies are for entertainment and this movie is thoroughly entertaining, especially because of the energetic roles/characters of the actors, the music, the dance etc. Everything about the movie is so lively and completely alive. Everyone's acting in the movie is good, the Indians' as well as the Canadians'. Tanisha Mukherjee and Uday Chopra have acted really well. For the short span of the movie, the characters are pretty well-etched, eg., the heroine's ego with respect to her being fired from jobs or being dumped by boyfriends. Even the psychology of the hero and heroine and their lack of communication just after their night together is shown naturally. Finally one movie doesn't show crap like 'I can't live without you' love. This movie shows just the optimum amount of attraction/emotions/love. I think after Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, this is the only cute movie of Yash Chopra/Aditya Chopra films. None of my friends had watched this movie, because of the general comment that it is not worth watching. But the day I finished my exam I got the CD and watched it. I somehow wanted to see it the day I saw the trailers. And after that most of my friends have watched it and they've all liked it. So, people, if you like bright, cheerful, cute, happy movies...this is the one for you."
