" What a Movie","Great movie seen in Bollywood as action, thrill, story line, direction, suspense all along. overall Power-packed performance by Shahrukh Khan. Truly the "KING IS BACK". People said that no-one could make a better Don than the man himself, Amitabh Bachchan. However, I would like to disagree. Shahrukh is the only actor of todays time that could ever make it better than the original. His style, charisma and witty remarks make it all the more appealing. Farhan Akhtar's superb directing made this film epic! There are no gaps, no over-the-top parts. As a director Farhan's best film ever. Film's background score is stunning. But the songs are not pretty good. The film's visual effects is better than MI-4, Ra.One, Robot, Krissh. It's stunning and well shot. The special effects add a special flavor to the film which makes it even more delicious. Each and every character in this film is perfect. But in some portion it remembers me Death Race2, specially in Jail. Anyway best movie of the year." 
" Don 2 worths 'one' lax watch","Review contains very minor spoilers.I walked into the theatre with zilch expectations but as the film progressed, I got drawn into it thanks to the twists in the tale. The film starts off from where Don: TCBA left, that is, Don (Sharukh Khan) escapes with Ayesha (Lara Dutta, counterpart of Esha Kopikkar) and Vardhaan (Boman Irani) is arrested. 5 years later, after becoming the underworld king of Asia, he has set his eyes on Europe and wants Vardhaan's help once again. He somehow releases Vardhaan from the jail and escapes to Berlin where he has to steal the money printing plates. He gets Aly Khan and Kunal Kapoor involved in his complex plan which slowly reveals to be more complex than what it appeared to be in the start. Meanwhile Junglee Billi Roma (Priyanka Chopra), Detective Malik (Om Puri) and newbie Sahil Shroff pursue Don to Berlin and that's where the action is set.Don 2 is a far bigger project that its prequel with more drama, more action and more masala. Treatment of the subject is very Hollywood and a few segments of the audience might not relate to the film easily. The sets are lavish and the production design is outlandish. Cinematography by Jason West does complete justice to the film and is a scoring point. Editing should have been slicker and the transition effects could have been better owing to the action genre.The leads – Khan and Chopra – give over the top performances. Khan's expressions and dialog delivery is too plastic and the cruelty is completely lacking in his performance. Priyanka tries hard to look like the mission-oriented, sincere cop but does it half-baked. She lacks the punch she had in Fashion or even in her last release, Anjaana Anjaani. She relies on a few tactics throughout. Om Puri is there for five-six scenes and is just there. Boman Irani is as always reliable and gives the right amount of flavor to his character. Lara Dutta is there for glam-quotient only – 2 scenes and a song. Kunal Kapoor required a meatier role to prove himself. Nevertheless the, he doesn't disappoint. Aly Khan (remember Konkona Sen's producer in Luck By Chance) gets more footage this time and is in top form. He steals the show with his towering performance. Lastly, we have débutant Sahil Shroff as Priyanka's teammate and love-interest whom we earlier saw in the Platinum Love Bands ad gives a startling performance. He looks cute in the initial scenes and speaks and emotes well. Longing to see more of him.Farhan did a grave error in the previous outing by placing "Khaike Pan Banaraswala" in the middle of the action. Neither was it required nor did it suit the situation. He has grown wiser this time by placing only two songs – 'Maya' and 'Zara Dil Ko' – in the film with the former being narrative. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy are lost in oblivion. Had they stayed away from the first one, the music would have been far better. Neither songs nor background score are effective. They don't match the standards of the film. I must appreciate Farhan's intelligence for depicting a completely different story with the title 'Don'. This one has no relation to the previous one. One who hasn't seen the earlier can easily understand this one and the film can be called a 'Heist Film' rather than 'Underworld Mafia film.' The second half is solely about the heist where Don acts as a robber than a mafia leader. As with the first, the twists in the tale are not easy to translate and the final twist appears superficial – solely to make ground for Don 3. A twist in between might also disappoint Chopra fans. Don is shown to be too intelligent and far- sighted this time which doesn't work always. Dialogs are straight out of 80's which may appease people like my dad but for me, they lacked subtlety and intelligence.A few scenes hold your interest immensely in the second half. Also, the car chase in the first half with Chopra and Shroff chasing Don in a huge SUV (the sexy Hyundai Santa Fe) through subways and parking lots is remarkable. However, emotions popping out of nowhere towards the end makes no sense. A better way to take the story forward could have been thought of.Having said it all, Don 2 deserves a watch for the efforts of the team. The first release in January, Players, which seems to be having a similar storyline of heist and robbery, may not get its share at the box office because of Don 2." 
" Farhan Akhtar has raised the bar for future sequels and action thrillers. Great performance by Shahrukh in the best Indian sequel so far!","In 2006, Sanjay Gadhvi made a sequel to the 2004 hit 'Dhoom' which was appreciated by most, but Rohit Shetty's sequel to 'Golmaal' faced mixed reviews. However, Rajkumar Hirani got it compeletely right with the Munna Bhai sequel, which was the perfect sequel to the first film. So it can be said that the record hasn't been all that great.. but it has certainly got better now!Farhan Akhtar's Don 2 is a sequel to his 2006 movie Don, a remake of the 70s Amitabh film. However, the story was sufficiently different and the twists in the tale left viewers gasping for more. Five years later, Farhan Akhtar has returned in an attempt to fulfill the enormous expectations on this sequel. I can say that my expectations were not only met but surpassed by a considerable distance!The story is strong and pretty special considering what we have previously seen from the Hindi film industry, but you wouldn't expect anything less from Farhan Akhtar. After conquering the Asian underworld, Don sets his eyes on Europe. Thrills are what you expect and thrills are what you get!The makers have clearly gone to town here as the level of authenticity and realism is extraordinary, especially considering that there are quite a few formulaic Hindi films released every year that fail to differ hugely from films that have come out of India before them. This is certainly one of those films that possess their own distinct identities.The performances are great. Shahrukh excels as Don and everything about his character is just awe-inspiring. I think this role is comparable with some of his best performances. Meanwhile, Priyanka Chopra too excels and Om Puri shows why he is regarded as a good actor. Boman Irani is impeccable as Vardhaan and Nawwab Shah is a revelation - watch out for him! Kunal Kapoor handles his role with ease, and is another one too look out for. The character development is superb.The dialogues are really good. They fit in and serve their purpose in a variety of situations.The songs of this film are not really the commercial type, but they fit in well in the various situations throughout the film. With this in mind, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have done a solid job with the music. The background score is great.Those who expect romantic music will be disappointed.The action sequences have been finely executed and do fit into the narrative very nicely. They really do add to the overall experience.Overall, this is a sequel that is far superior to the first film. As an action thriller with world-class action, top notch performances and a western feel, this presents further proof that Hollywood has some serious competition. It's a gem of a film from Farhan Akhtar, who I regard as one of the top 5 best directors in India today. With Shahrukh delivering a great performance, this film will not disappoint fans of his and action enthusiasts. One of the best films (not just from India) of 2011! A must watch!!9.5/10." 
" A stylish movie with none other than the King of Cinema, Shahrukh Khan.","People said that no-one could make a better Don than the man himself, Amitabh Bachchan. However, I would like to disagree. Shahrukh is the only actor of todays time that could ever make it better than the original. His style, charisma and witty remarks make it all the more appealing. Farhan Akhtar's superb directing made this film epic! There are no gaps, no over-the-top parts and surprisingly, no dancing.. Don and Roma's love/hate relationship is also great to watch and you can sense the sizzling chemistry between Shahrukh and Priyanka! I'm desperately waiting for a Don 3: The King Takes Over ;) 10/10 for sure. It would be an insult to compare these movies to other standard Bollywood movies, as Don 2 is - in my opinion - better than most, if not every, Hollywood action/thriller I've seen. Farhan, we're waiting :)" 
" best action film by Bollywood","saw the special screening of Don 2 in Dubai film festival.Frankly speaking I was stunned by the movie.Simple plot but the twists and turns in the movie were amazing.I will not reveal the plot details because you will loose interest in it.But the story is simple after becoming the underworld king of Asia,Don has targeted European underworld, the film shows the way in which Don fulfills his dream.The movie is at par with Hollywood action movies.Car chase,action,stunts,visuals were awesome.Shahrukh Khan was at his best,he gave a special feeling to the movie.But Boman Irani,Priyanka Chopra,Kunal Kapoor have also done a great job.Nawab Shah was also outstanding, he deserves a special applause. In the end Don 2 is a fine made product with an open ending.It is a must watch this holiday season.Farhan Akhtar has once again proved that he is a fine director.His directing skills are awesome, he should direct more movies." 
" Stylish & Slick","Don 2, the sequel to Don starts from where the prequel ended.Though the story is surreal, impractical and seems like fantasy, the director gives it a slick treatment.It doesn't let go, even for a moment. The plot is stylishly crafted,with every twist and turn falling into place. Farhan Akhtar yet again proves that he is the most stylish film maker of recent times. The first half may seem cold in comparison with the 2nd, as the 2nd half takes the film onto a different level and keeps you on the edge of the seats.The script will mostly appeal to the urban crowd who are absolutely hooked onto international thrillers. The twists and turns in the 2nd hour may not be totally understandable to the average viewer.Action is the USP of Farhan Akhtar's film. The chases, the fights, the destructions, escapes were spectacular and have all been done at par with International Standards.The car chase between Priyanka and Shah Rukh was unbelievable.The cinematography was top notch, be it the indoor or the outdoor shots. The locations in Berlin, Zurich, Malaysia & Thailand, where it was shot completely came alive. The stylization & look for every actor was so well defined.Shah Rukh Khan uses all his charisma & attitude and woos the audience with his charm. He is the the lifeline of the movie.And this is definitely amongst his best works till date. Priyanka Chopra, Boman Irani,Om Puri, Sahil Shroff, Kunal Kapoor, Alyy Khan & Nawab Shah were very very good in their respective parts. Lara Dutta looks glamorous but has nothing else to do.Shah Rukh Khan & Priyanka Chopra's chemistry for those 5 minutes was crackling. Like a spot on the moon, the cameo by Hrithik Roshan was unnecessary & forced. Hrithik looked awesome but playing Shah Rukh's masked avatar was totally bizarre. As their height, voice and body do not share any damn similarity.What makes Don 2 a winner is,the public cheers every time a task is accomplished by Don. This is indeed credible because Don, after all, is a negative character.Special mention is the last scene where Shah Rukh Khan rides a bike and passes on a bridge over the French Riveira, Oh My God-he has never looked so handsome before. All will definitely skip a heart beat. Don 2 ends with the promise of Don 3. Mr.Akhtar-we are waiting." 
" Mind Blowing action, Farhan's strong control on script and Powerpacked performance from SRK. Truly the "KING IS BACK".","Don 2 is perhaps the best Christmas film in the last 5 years. It's slick,stylish and high on acting and visual effects. When it's SRK and Farhan together, miracles are bound to happen and it well happens for Don 2 is the best Christmas gift that Bollywood could offer and it is definitely an emblem of the acting skills of SRK whose kingship is proved. ACTING: SRK is the man who reigns supreme in this film and leaves a strong impression on the audiences mind with his stellar performance. His smile, dialogue delivery and every expression deserves a bow. Priyanka looked beautiful and does well in the second half. Her chemistry with SRK is electrifying.She deserves an applause for well balancing herself as a woman in love and hatred with the same man. Boman Irani is excellent as ever and in negative role he is always a treat to watch. Kunak Kapoor is impressive and Lara Dutta looks gorgeous. Hrithik gives a stunning performance in his cameo. His ball dance withPriyanka was a visual delight.DIRECTION: Farhan handles the scenes well and never lets the adrenaline rush or the script to fall flat. He keeps the audiences glued to their seat and this versatile man gives as a slick action thriller which is far better than Race,Dhoom,Dhoom 2 and even SRK's Ra.One.SCRIPT: The script is well written and every scene is well handled. Dialogues are brilliant and none of the scene fall flat. No unnecessary toilet humour and songs have made the film even more appealing.MUSIC: The song Zaraa Dil Ko Thaam Lo is well sung by Vishal Dadlani and well shot. Background score and Hain Ye Mayaa was fabulous.TECHNIQUE: Don 2's description is incomplete without commenting on it's cinematography and special effect.The film's visuals is better than MI-4,Ra.One,Robot,Krissh.It's stunning and well shot. Thailand and Berlin and Zurich looked picturesque. The special effects add a special flavour to the film which makes it even more delicious.ACTING: 9.5/10 { 8 in general, 1.5 extra for SRK} DIRECTION: 7.5/10 SCRIPT: 7/10 MUSIC: 7/10 TECHNIQUE: 9.5/10 Overall I rate the film 9.5 out of 10." 
" good one","all at one word i like to say good not a bad movie. positive points 1-its style and modern looking than other bollywood film 2-the way sharukh khan acts very good as don 3-it has everything a good action movie needs-a car chase,a item song,two fight scenes,a very special don escape,and also with light comedies. 4-what a super suspense at last,the entry and climax scene is outstanding. 5-what a super direction with twists.negative points 1-do not have much good story line.over suspense that is make people over confused about the suspense.as a final result it will be a absolute blockbuster and good movie." 
" A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: SRK rules the rooster in Don 2, much to the delight of Action and Heist enthusiasts","It's often difficult to be tolerant to someone who tries to imitate greatness! It was the same prejudice that preceded the arrival of the SRK starer Don in 2006, the remake of the 1978 classic by the same name with Mr Bachchan in the title role. Besides, it is inevitable for any remake to be compared endlessly to the original. Despite all odds the movie did considerably well on the box office primarily because of Farhan Akhtar's imaginative yet calculative movie-making. The new elements introduced into the plot also gave the movie a breath of fresh air. Also, it was the crucial role played by SRK, in making the movie significantly different than its precursor, who mustered all his courage and talent to conjure up an alter ego that offered a great contrast to Mr. Bachchan's portrayal in the original motion picture. Farhan Akhtar and his entire team worked meticulously to keep the movie free of any possible anachronisms, which are often unavoidable in such remakes. By the time the movie approached its climactic finale, it became quite obvious even to the most seasoned viewer that Farhan Akhtar's vision behind the remake far transcended the mere thought of imitating the classic. He had set his goals much higher with the idea of establishing a completely new franchise at its core. The half a decade hiatus after the 2006 remake can be attributed to Farhan's attempt at self indulgence, which got him completely disillusioned about his directorial prowess, to make way for the latent actor in him, as he strived to prove his acting mettle in movies like Rock On!! (2008), Luck by Chance (2009), Karthik Calling Karthik(2010), and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011). To Farhan's credit, he did succeed in getting the actor in him to get going on the celluloid.Since the last few years, the grapevine had been rife with speculations pertaining to Akhtar's behind the camera return for the much anticipated sequel of Don with SRK reprising his role of the most decorated mafia kingpin in the history of Indian Cinema. The speculations were brought to rest as the makers finally confirmed the movie's 2011 Christmas release. The promotions for the movie started a bit late and strangely lacked the the usual hullabaloo that surrounds an SRK release. With Don 2, Farhan Akhtar takes the high stake battle between life and death to a completely new echelon with a screenplay that's as taut as it's exhilarating . Don 2 is a high octane extravaganza that presents an average viewer with everything that he possibly craves for—action, voyeur, thrill and intrigue. The movie is full of pleasant surprises and keeps the viewer interested throughout. The movie lulls the viewer into a perpetual frenzy, which a modern cineaste demands and deserves. The movie's heist-like setup makes it conducive to high speed car chases, vertiginous jumps, voyeuristic escapades, hand-to-hand combat, blood-cuddling shootout sequences, etc.There seems a paradigm shift in the quality of movie making compared to the general trends in the Hindi Cinema. The actions sequences depicted in the movie are at par with the international standards. The highly punctilious team of internationally acclaimed stunt coordinator Wolfgang Stegemann seems to have inoculated the movie with an ineffable sense of realism that is often missing in Indian productions. The entire cast and crew have done a phenomenal job in bringing the movie and its vivid characters to life. SRK once again shines as the glacial, conniving, quick-witted, rugged, cool & calculative, perpetually smirked underworld kingpin Don. Don 2 is SRK's movie from inception to finale and it is his omnipresence that takes the movie a couple of notches up. In some scenes, his antics and mannerisms are highly reminiscent of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, but SRK carries himself with such poise that he seems quite natural at it. The viewer also gets the privilege of witnessing SRK in the new avatar of an Action hero, which he pulls off with same finesse. Some of SRK's most staunch critics might censure him for overplaying the part, but apparently the script demanded such high levels of intensity. During the course of the movie, SRK gets to depict a wide variety of contrasting demeanors as Don goes about his usual business, driving high on his ever reliable instinct, making new enemies, friends, patching up with old enemies, and once again making them into enemies. The opening action sequence and the classic car chase—the best chase scene ever filmed in Hindi cinema—remind a lot of the traditional elements of a Bond movie, but not without a 'Desi' tinge. Priyanka Chopra offers a nice contrast to SRK's part as a mobster's moll in the making, but fails to leave her signature on the movie. Almost everyone in the supporting cast has given a worthy performance with special mention of Boman Irani, Lara Dutta, and Aly Khan. Movie's cinematography, sound, editing and choreography are all state of the art. Overall, Don 2 is an exhilarating ride for the Action movie enthusiasts as well as for all those whose primary aim is entertainment. All those who look for cinematic profundity or pristineness can also partially enjoy the movie, but only by slackening the screws of scrutiny. Don 2 has set the ball rolling for more movies to come in the franchise, while also setting a new benchmark for Hindi Cinema. A must watch for Heist and Action lovers. 8/10For more, please visit my movie blog: A Potpourri of Vestigeswww.apotpourriofvestiges.com" 
" Shah Rukh Does It Again :D :D","It's 23rd December, and the last week for Bollywood 2011 begins today. This was a rather average year with very few movies that got unanimous praise. Don 2 directed by Farhan Akhtar having Shah Rukh Khan repirse his evil avatar 5 years later was for obvious reasons the most anticipated movie of the year. I though personally didn't feel that it would be anything too great. Starting off in Indonesia, with the Don stating that he has become the King Pin in Asia the movie has a unique style with a sleek look to it. Shah Rukh Khan does enough to woo every lady in the audience. His swaggering walk to accompany his confident dialogue delivery and menacing smile would surely make him a contender for the Awards this year.The first half builds the movie up and at times you'd feel lacks the pace an action movie would want but the intelligent direction, having just the one song in the movie and the absolutely delightful work by Javed Akhtar on the dialogues tickle your funny bones time in and time out.The Second half is where you feel that the movie can be compared to Hollywood. The cinematography by Jason West is superb that along with a gritty screenplay glues you to your seats.Boman Irani plays cleverly with his expressions and witty lines and long with the undeniable presence of the King form the best part of the film. Priyanka Chopra looks pretty and does an average job. The rest of the cast just hops along the main one and puts up an above average effort.The music which was evident even before disappoints. I didn't like the music of the earlier Don either. S-E-L are expected to be much better.All in all the movie is stylish, elegant and can even be seen more than once but please don't ruin it by thinking it'll be better than the MI or BOND series.And an Extra Clap of the Hand for Shah Rukh. What charm!3/5 for Don 2. I'll watch it again and review it again too. I have to :D" 
" With Don 2 Shahrukh back again","Since last few years Shahrukh Khan several movies (Rab ne Banadi Jodi, Billu Barbar, My name is Khan and latest Ra One) did good business but failed to attain the success associated with Shahrukh and since Ra One may started to search for new King for Bollywood but the King Khan back with a Bang. You still remember Bazigar and Darr and here is once again Shahrukh is on the zenith of acting with an arrogant, agile, wicked and wild dare-devil who has the most bizarre schemes up his sleeve Shahrukh proof himself the best.Don 2 beside Shahrukh is an amazing movie with unforgettable action scene and car chase sequences but the scene of Prison Breaking and robbery of Currency Plate. This action packed package seriously get your attention from the very first scene but the part of Music is relatively below par and there are very few moment of emotion human relation. But Don will force you to visit him again and again." 
" At last .....THE KING ARISES........n unconquerable !!! KUDOS","DON 2:the king is back....(As the title suggests),SRK provides a stellar performance as an antagonist who is arrogant n wicked yet overwhelmingly charming n stylish.Such is the charisma of his act,that the audience even knowing the fact he will do no good to anybody wants him to do more n this is where SRK out wittingly steals the show.Rest of the cast also puts up a good show.Farhan Akhtar none the less proves himself why he is considered one of the finesse directors in the industry.With ably crafted cinematography by Jason West n spine chilling action sequences especially the car chase,DON 2 is one of the best action thrillers ever to be made in BOLLYWOOD even surpassing many of the action packed Hollywood movies. Do watch this hell of a ride at least for SHAHRUKH or its CLASS...MY RATING: 8/10" 
" Bang! Crash!! Kaboom!!! - that's "Don 2"...","The first five minutes of Farhan Akhtar's shiny new flick "Don 2" is lists of media partners, brand partners, and other partners against a black screen, so one gauges there is going to be a vast amount of product placement. Then follow the names of German funding entities, and we realize that this is a German-Indian co-production—it's cool that Germany has taken to investing in Indian enterprises and offering tax incentives to film in the Fatherland. At that point, an impatient Sardarji yelled out in the dark: "Oy, that's enough – let's balle balle!" to much laughter in the house. Then the film began and for the next two hours raced at breakneck speed, pausing briefly every few minutes to blow something up. I skipped Farhan Akhtar's remake of the 1978 hit Don with Amitabh Bachchan and Zeenat Aman – why bother with it when the original is still kicking around? Don 2 is advertised as an original work – that's what attracted me. However, out of curiosity, I did look up the song done by Kareena Kapoor on YouTube, and, yup, Helen needn't spare a second thought about anybody wresting that "Peerless Danseuse of the Hindi Screen" title away from her. Poor Kareena, in her pudgy phase then, tried hard but didn't even come close to what Ms. Richardson so effortlessly gave us back in '78. Akhtar appears to have altered something in his remake, for when the sequel opens, the good Don is nowhere to be seen; the bad Don is still alive, having a blast, and now wreaking havoc around the world. He's gone global. Avenging angel Roma—the Zeenat Aman character—traipses in his wake, always a moment too late on the uptake and the crime scene. She's been given a hunky subordinate who throws her melting looks and frisks after her like an adorable puppy. Whenever tough chick Roma (Priyanka Chopra) girds her loins to do battle with Don (a full-time occupation for the entire police forces of India, Malaysia, Germany, perhaps Switzerland, too), he acts touchingly solicitous. In one of the twists in the tale, when Roma has to go on a rescue mission with Don, loverboy gets to snarl at Shah Rukh, "If anything happens to her" and doesn't even complete the threat. Really, little man, really? Shah Rukh has great fun striding around with a bad ass attitude, many tattoos, and in the first part of the film, designer stubble and a hybrid coif that's part corn-rows, part dreads—and excuse my saying—part greasy and unwashed. Still, he's Shah Rukh, and can pull off anything. He's a lean mean fighting machine, and for reasons known only to him, allows himself to be arrested by Roma and incarcerated in a chic Malaysian prison. There's not a trace of grittiness—the prison has a jolly orange and crisp white color scheme and looks practically wholesome. Good old Boman Irani playing a mean baddie Vardhaan, who impersonated an Interpol officer in the original, is Shah Rukh's prison mate. However nasty Boman tries to be, I always feel he'll revert to comedy mode, and cackle "Fooled you - just kidding!" Vardhaan and Don have a balletic knife fight, then break out of prison together, and team up to relieve the German Central Bank of its Euro printing plates. Why mess with small-time labor-intensive activities like running international drug cartels, when you can just print your own cash supply without offering anything in return! Don is baddest guy on the block, but loses a little of his street cred and edge, when recently sprung from prison, he reunites with his new honey/admin assistant Ayesha ( a slinky sophisticated Lara Dutta) and a number of sexy girl and boy henchmen (henchpeople?) in a Vegas-style synchronized song-and-dance routine, which would have called for weeks of rehearsal. Uh-huh, that's exactly what the most dangerous criminal in the world would do to strike fear in the hearts of opponents. The jokey vibe persists through innumerable convoluted cons and double cons, crosses and double-crosses. It's engaging and fast moving, and whenever your attention wanders – wait, who's conning whom now? – there's an explosion to jolt you out of your reverie. Everyone tries to out-do Don, but Shah Rukh always has the last laugh, delivers cheesy lines with panache, and demonstrates that sheer star power can transcend utter improbability. There are fights aplenty, matched with an abundance of shameless product placement: gangs of baddies and battalions of S.W.A.T. teams routinely synchronize watches, giving us 70mm close-ups of Tag Heuer time pieces; breathless chases with Hyundai, BMW, and Mercedes cars (a vehicle for every price point, you see) proving their endurance and longevity; and designer duds, jewelery, and sunglasses from various fashion houses schilled by Shah Rukh, Priyanka, and Lara. This is a well-crafted popcorn flick, with excellent cinematography (Jason West doing his best work), slick editing (Anand Subaya), and world-class stunts and chases – Farhan Akhtar owes much to the Bourne and Bond series, for there is a similarity of look, feel, and pace. Apart from looking stern and indomitable (Priyanka) and smart, sexy, and efficient (Lara), the women don't have a lot to do. Kunal Kapoor is effective as a computer hacker brought in for the heist, but only gets to Tazer a single guy – Shah Rukh deals with everybody else in every single country we visit in the course of the flick. Okay, Shah Rukh, we've humored you and ponied up our $$$ for Ra-One and Don 2; now we need a good ol' fashioned grown-up love-story from you, before Farhan Akhtar lobs Don 3, 4, & 5 like grenades at us." 
" Not a true following to the first Don.","As much as I awaited for Don 2 and the lines delivered by SRK as well as his facial looks, I was disappointed by Don 2.Whereas in the first Don, Shah Rukh Khan was menacing, threatening, and downright badass, in the sequel, he is more kinder, and has traits which is reminiscent of Vijay at times.Overall, I would say watch Don's ending on youtube, and then see this movie's ending. That is enough to say that Don had much more oomph and left you shocked, whereas the sequel was just a heist movie where Don gets caught not once but several times and has a few twists here and there. The twists are nowhere as dramatic or mind boggling as the first movie but rather unnecessary twists like the movie Race. I wish Farhan would reconsider his choices as his second movie in the franchise is more or less the same seen before. The first one was one of its kind even though it was a remake. In the first, Don was a powerful kingpin but came close to death at one point and met his match with Arjun Rampal's Jasjit while trying to stay out of Roma's vengeful spirit. In this movie, Don faces no challenge. His biggest obstacle is the cops and he simply has no one to feel real danger from. I give this movie a 6/10 because:Don is not as menacing and relies on a heist to make his getaway which is not really as intelligent in his part. - The punch lines are delivered way to many times and in some cases both the punchlines and soundtrack are lifted from the first movie and overused. - Prianka's Roma is nowhere near as vengeful as she was in the first movie. In this movie, she is just a sexy female cop who feels sorry for Don. - Lara Dutta's role much just a tad bit longer than Hrithik Roshan's cameo. That's a shame considering Don's girl is Ayesha and not Roma. - There are no side hero's or powerful performances. Arjun Rampal's presence is missed and sadly Kunal Kapoor is just a smart computer whiz and nothing else. There are no anti-villain or like to take down Don. He simply is a one man show with everyone either supporting him or eventually supporting him. - Don bungee jumping from the tower with a rope seemed more like a publicity stunt rather than an actual choice. It's hard to understand how he would conveniently find the rope to make a leap. Watch MI:GP where Tom Cruise leaps from a tower as well but he had every reason to do so. Don could have taken down the baddie and simply go downstairs but he drops and in the next shot you see a rope holding him. - Boman Irani's lack of enthusiasm or charisma from the first movie, Arjun Rampal's is also missed. He was a willing contender and gave Don a run for his money. In this movie, everyone is equally dumb and helpless except for Don. - (SPOILER ALERT) Don willing to die in Roma's hand and feeling compassion for her and Roma not shooting Don is the biggest reason this movie receives a low rating from me. I wish Bollywood could be original and have a unlikable monster, but Don is more of a hero in this one. (SPOILER END)+ Hrithik's Roshan's cameo was genuinely nice even though the whole premise of wearing a mask was sort of unrealistic. It did remind me of the first movie with concealing identity. + Don's facial hair and looks are really a big plus considering Bollywood is very lazy when they show passage of time. Hence, SRK's changing looks does give you a sense of passage of time. + The car chase and fight scenes where on par with Hollywood movies and certainly realistic and filled with effort. + Berlin is a riveting, dynamic playground for Don and his actions even though the movie's location could have been anywhere. I say this only because its a heist movie and not one about mafia kinpin and setting up empire in a established location. + Some use of fashionable clothes, cars, gadgets, but none of these props are presented enough for people to want to purchase them. The first movie was a trend setter from the shirt Don wore in Yeh Mera Dil, to his watch, to his Motorola Razr cellphone, Tag Huer watch, sunglasses, Mercedes car, state of the art lazer laptop, etc. In this movie, the props are not as evident and hence I do not expect people to do much more than get the D tattoo or sport facial hair. The props are there bit limited.Lastly, the remake Don from 2006 showed how committed and dedicated Don was in building his empire. He worked hard for it, and his pace was really fast. Roma and DCP were a threat to him so he played along until he could make his getaway. In this movie, Don is playful with no real goal other than escaping after the heist is over. The real shame is that Don gets caught more than once, returns back to the same place after the heist, and has to fight the bad guys more than once. The movie is nothing you have never seen before, and certainly not as stylish and trendsetting as the remake." 
" Brilliant SRK comeback. Watch even if you're not a fan of SRK.","This movie was beautifully produced for a Bollywood movie. I even suspect that it can be listed with the all time greats such as Mission Impossible. The action sequences are brilliant and not overdone (which is rare for Bollywood). The story is extremely amazing and there are a few twists and turns that I was not expecting at all. The movie is very suspenseful, yet it grabbed my attention. I was in the theater and I don't think that there was one person in there who was not screaming! From Don's entry all the way to the romantic dialogues, this is a much watch film for Bollywood lovers. To keep it short and to the point: SRK was brilliant (as he is most of the time, but the villainous role was brilliantly done), Priyanka was quite good (even though she wasn't in the movie that much), and Boman Irani and the person who played Jabbar were quite good as well. Acting: 9/10, Screenplay: 10/10, Dialogues: 9/10, and overall: 9/10." 
" Not up to the expectations...","I saw Don and felt that it was not as good as the the original just because of the ending. In the remake Don is shown winning and more powerful. I was not at all happy to see that kind of an ending, until I heard that there was going to be a sequel for don. But no it was equally disappointing. The don was taken more like an award film. It was slow and dialogues were also not that good. But don 2 was faster and had more action scenes but still the ending were don was shown winning was really disappointing.Not a very inspiring ending and still it had many unexplained points. But if it has another sequel then it doesn't matter.Shah Rukh Khan was excellent. He has proved that He is THE MOST VERSATILE ACTOR in India. He turned into completely different personality in this movie.Priyanka Chopra too was good. She is the best action heroine in bollywood. Lara dutta was good in spite of small role.Songs were not as good the songs in don.action scenes are very nice and re watchable. 3D effects are not exceptional.6/10"
