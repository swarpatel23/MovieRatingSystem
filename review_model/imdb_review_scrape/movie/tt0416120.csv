" prototypical potboiler","the film is a laugh-riot. akshay delivers another mighty 'cop' performance, the most prolific section of his repertoire. he moves effortlessly from an almost instantaneous romance, to a nervous meeting with the girl's father and on to a stormy climax of good cops taking on an empire of criminals, politicians and corrupt policemen. as you can probably tell, a truly original script.raveena is excellent in her role as the tortured girlfriend of a virtuous cop. this film has 'moving' performances by all of bollywood's best-known baddies. the item girl, payal rohatgi, deserves special mention as the least laughable part of the film.this film offers more laughs than most bollywood comedies can claim to. enjoy!" 
" Outdated","Akshay and Raveena were a couple in 1990s since Mohra(1994) and again they acted in Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi(1996) only this 2 worked and then they split in 1996 followed by their pair was there in films like Keemat and Barood(1998) both flops. Their pair was never seen again, however this film which was earlier titled VIDROH started in 1996 and got stuck in cans due to their changed relationship and finally the film is released in 2004 . In 1990's Akshay was not considered an actor and neither Raveena was known for her acting skills those days however by 2004 when the film releases, Akshay already was riding high on the success of Khakee where he got praised and slowly he was gaining praise of critics and audiences. Raveena too got a national award for Daman(2001) and was shifting towards meaningful cinema. The film was released when cops films were in demand and there was an overdose of films, Kagaar,Khakee, Aan Men At Work(which released a week later).etc This film as it was started in 1996 suffers from a 90's syndrome, not only the looks of the actors look stale, even the plot and execution is stale, The looks of actors like Govind Namdeo, Raj Babbar give away ditto for Akshay and Raveena(most of the films seem shot in 1990s)Direction by Dilip Shukla suffers due to it's delay and writing Music is ordinary, only Rafta Rafta seems shot recentlyAkshay Kumar signed the film during his 90s days, not only his looks are inconsistent, his act also alternates between 90s and 2000s Also his role hardly seems a challenge for him, and in the same year he was seen in Khakee and this hardly seems challenging for him Raveena Tandon too hardly gets scope(She signed the film in 90s) and har looks too are inconsistent Amrish Puri gets ample meat and he does a good job Govind Namdeo's presence startles the viewer, he looks straight out of 90s films and his act is okay Alok Nath,Raj Babbar too have jaded looks Raj Babbar is okay in a negative role though he overdoes at many places Rami Reddy too appears in the film and he is as usual, Mohan Joshi is as usual,rest are okay" 
" Delayed but Good","Dilip Shukla was a very good scriptwriter and he was known for scripting fantastic movies like Ghayal and Damini but he wanted to do more than scriptwriting. He wanted to direct an action film which exposes the true face of politics and how cops aren't allowed to perform their duties because of evil politicans who kill their own people just to get more votes to win the elections. The film was earlier titled Vidroh and it was to release in 1997 after shooting started in early 1996. However, the film kept getting delayed and was in the can till 2004. After 2000, such films were done to death and typical action wasn't liked as much as it used to be liked. Therefore, Police Force: An Inside Story released in 2004, got mainly negative reviews, and failed to generate good income and eventually flopped.The film tells the story of Vijay Singh who is training under Additional Officer Mr.Pandey to become a cop but when he has to go to Bombay to continue his training, he sees how the right things don't happen, his senior Mr Bhosle is corrupt and doesn't like it when Vijay tries to save a man from bad guys who wanted his money. He says Vijay was not posted there so he shouldn't have gone to save him. Vijay witnesses the murder of politician Sawant and he chases after the criminals only to get involved in a police shootout. Vijay shoots the killer to save his life because all the cops got murdered by the killer. The killer turns out to be a cop who gunned Sawant for a politician, Ratan Sethi. When Vijay comes to know that Ratan Sethi is behind this, he goes to his house and humiliates him. This worsens the matter and Vijay gets framed for carrying drugs when he wasn't carrying drugs. He is sent to prison and drugged and he has fallen in the trap of the villains. Mr Pandey comes to know this and he is trying to save Vijay with the help of the commissioner of police. Will Vijay die in Prison from the wounds Bhosle is giving him? Will Vijay escape prison and murder the villains? Will Pandey be able to save Vijay? Watch this decent crime drama to find out.Direction by Dilip Shukla is surprisingly good and for a debutant, he does a fine job. The script is tight and original making it appeal to action lovers of Bollywood and the film isn't completely typical. The dialogues stand out the most especially the ones Amrish Puri mouths, the scene where he teaches his students to point out anyone's mistake even if they belong to a high position. The only thing that weakens the film is Vijay's love story with Roma which wasn't needed. The climax is superb with awesome action scenes, the stunts are realistic and I was very impressed. Another thing I liked was that the hero was not shown as an untouchable larger than life guy, he stood for what's right and the police made his life miserable during the mid portions of the film.Akshay Kumar is simply superb whenever he plays a cop on screen and this time, he is awesome. He is superb in the action scenes, he is superb when he confronts Ratan Sethi for the first time, and he is superb when he gets tortured showing the right expressions with barely any overacting. Raveena Tandon shines in her small role which wasn't needed but it was nice fun to see her on screen. She is looking beautiful in the film. Amrish Puri is superb in his role and he should've had a bigger part in the first half of the film. It's so funny whenever he said "Bloody Jokers" to Akshay and his friends training under him. Raj Babbar is good but he overacts terribly in the scene where he is drunk in his party. Govind Namdeo overacts terribly and he wasn't needed in the movie. The rest provide good support but most of the supporting actors have limited roles.Music is good mainly because of the song "Tu Pyar Karegi Mujhse Rafta Rafta" which is very catchy and it has been choreographed well. The other songs are good too but this one was the best. Stunts are brilliant with realistic shots and there were no cheesy stunts.Overall, Police Force: An Inside Story was a good film and I wouldn't mind watching it again. The film appealed to me mainly because it was well scripted, well directed and had brilliant performances from Akshay Kumar and Amrish Puri."
