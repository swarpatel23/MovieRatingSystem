" Akshay is in full form in this entertaining masala flick made on the lines of WANTED.","Being once again a South remake of a Malayalam Hit POKKIRI RAJA (2010), the fact gets proved repeatedly that the Regional Cinema in India is much ahead than the Hindi Film Industry by miles, when it comes to pure commercial, action packed entertainers. Strengthening the fact, BOSS begins impressively with an action packed sequence featuring Danny and the new kid (playing the young Akshay). The start sets the mood rightly but then takes too much time to introduce the real BOSS. However once Akshay enters the screen after almost 30 minutes like a storm, the pace returns back and his entry (with the credits) just remind you the old school pattern followed by Manmohan Desai and Subhash Ghai, who also preferred bringing in their Hero after a while with a killer sequence. Having a seen before yet engaging story to tell, BOSS offers a fine build up in its initial hour with enough material for the single screen regions full of comedy, action, emotion and music. The interesting clashes between the characters keep the energy moving and the viewers are just eager to see Akshay meeting the cunning Police officer Ronit Roy in the next scenes. Now usually a Hindi film drops hugely post intermission which is thankfully not the case with BOSS. The film keeps offering many well written and entertaining sequences in its second half which basically becomes its real winning card in the end. Actually many impressive sequences in the film don't let you rate it as an average film and that is the reason it turns out to be much more than an average entertainer. The screenplay takes good care of a constant flow of energy and doesn't let any dull moment to be there spoiling the whole game. Cinematography captures the fun & light feel of the movie superbly (with some great locations) and so does the background score which plays a major role in keeping you excited.In India, a hit soundtrack is considered as half the battle won quite rightly. So as required the title track "Boss" becomes a perfect song to run in the background and "Hum Na Chhoren" has full energy in its choreography performed well featuring cameos by Prabhu Deva and Sonakshi Sinha. The major hit "Party All Night" (with the controversial word muted) further lifts your spirits up in the final hour easily and you can clearly hear the cheers once the current musical sensation Honey Singh comes on the screen, delivering his famous rap. Other than these Hits, there is a downer too in its soundtrack, which is a pathetic version of famous "Har Kisi Ko Nahin Milta Yahan Pyar" from JANBAAZ (1986). And I really fail to understand, why they try to recreate these old musical gems when they don't exactly know how to treat them with any similar kind of love, care and emotion.Anyway, apart from the already famous songs, the greatest contribution of BOSS's soundtrack in my opinion is its rare, well thought of and soulfully penned song on "A Father" or "Pitaah", soulfully sung by Sonu Nigam. A song talking about a person, on whom you don't find many songs made in the history of Hindi Film Music in the recent past. Looking at the project from the direction point of view, it's a strong comeback film for Anthony D'Souza after his last huge debacle. May be the reference point of the original worked here in his favour but the way he perfectly balances his both halves with the right insertions, it seems that he has positively moved on and has learned his lessons well. In the performances, here is a new, fresh or rather good old Akshay Kumar back in form as an all rounder entertainer and this is a rare Hindi film wherein the main hero doesn't have a heroine to romance. Further in one of the best chase sequences filmed on actual locations, Akshay evidently shows that he is in fact the most physically fit actor in the Industry at the present, among his contemporaries. Mithunis simply outstanding as the father, following the path of honesty and Danny is a delight to watch, like always. Ronit Roy makes the best use of this grand opportunity given in a noteworthy, impactful manner and Shiv Pandit shows his yet to be tapped talent brightly. Aditi looks charming but has nothing to do as per the script. Johny Lever, Govind Namdev, Parikshit Sahni and Sanjay Mishra are fine but its Aakash Dabhade, who superbly adds to the comic element of the film along with Akshay. Besides Sudesh Berry, Mukesh Tiwari and Shakti Kapoor are just there for only one scene.Coming out of the praising mode, BOSS has many unwanted and avoidable elements too which could have been left out to give it a better and universally appealing feel in totality. Firstly, there is big loop hole in the film dealing with the unintentional murder in the initial reels, for which the culprit is never booked by the law and he keeps moving freely. Secondly certain things are just added illogically in the film, like there was no need of Aditi to appear in a two piece costume which doesn't suit her shy & introvert character from any angle. Shakti Kapoor is brought in as a plumber just for nothing and then there are few double meaning dialogues added quite carelessly to cater a different section of viewers. Nevertheless, ignoring the above loopholes in this otherwise enjoyable flick, I would like to add that if you truly love the 70s-80s old school feel of Hindi Cinema, full of masala entertainment & heroism, then BOSS is surely going to win you over largely. The film is well equipped with full on entertainment in WANTED style, so do give it a try and the chances are that you would not be disappointed, despite all the negative vibes." 
" A Decent Akshay Kumar Entertainer","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3/5 starsHarmless fun. Thankfully the fun is not numbed down by being all too brainless - just the sporadic instance here and there, mostly interspersed within the action scenes. Akshay Kumar enjoys himself in a role he can sleep through and he succeeds in involving the audience in his revelry. We even get to see him doing some real action and stunts after a long time.Shiv Pandit just passes muster, while Aditi Rao Hydari literally has nothing to do. Sadly Mithun forgot his acting chops at home, and Danny's acting chops are criminally underutilized. But above all, the real scene stealer from the very first frame he enters till the last is Ronit Roy, who essays his first complete negative role with sublime malevolence." 
" A Coffee To Drink For EveryOne","Akshay did it again while, i think this was his best movie so far with complete action packed movie with full loads of comedy. Acting wise Akshay was Super. But a bit of lag in story. Akshay haters will also love this movie. I will recommend this movie to those who want some spice in their life as this could be also told as full money use movie.. Because after such disgraceful movies last month this new and a coffee that cold be drank twice if you are an Akshay Fan. I would rate this movie 8/10. I Would also like say that is the best Akshay movie i saw till date. While those who hates movie watching that they say i it is complete waste of time suggest them this movie for first timers i bet that they will surely like it. As this is much i told about this movie and i would love if someone who is interested in making comment below and suggest your friends and family members for this. one of my friend told for this movie but i was waiting for another but when saw this it was amazing. suggest this movie they will like it." 
" awesome entertainer !!!!!! :)","don't listen to anybody...just leave your brain at home and go for this one even if u r not an akki fan...superb entertainer of the year...u can watch true akshay flavor...;)from the start only there is lots of drama comedy n all...after many boring movies this month this is a sure shot blockbuster..The second-half of this breakneck-speed, blues-chaser of a movie opens with a long chase sequence through the narrow gallis of a dusty small-town in North India where we last saw Akshay Kumar having a ball in 'Rowdy Rathod' and 'Khiladi 786'.Akshay, God bless his innate sense of joie de vivre underlined by a distant demeanour of unspoken tragedy that shows up in a welter of wistfulness, imparts to the old-as- the-hills heroism, a sense of freshly-found humour." 
" boss is always right","This one surely needs to be watched as it was a fun.I know it was a bit of mindless but an throughly enjoyable movie that banks on quite a few departments. akshay is the protagonist here and he does full justice 2 the character.he is funny and his dialogue delivery is better.ronit roy is antagonist and got to be appreciated because he really suited this role.others are fine. music is really good. story wise it might be an average flick but performances gave it great support.it's not great film but a time pass movie which can be definitely enjoyed with the family and lastly action scenes are attention seeker. bottom line- watch it for akshay ,ronit and for an entertainer." 
" Boss-the boss of entertainment","After Rowdy Rathore,Boss is another Akshay kumar film that is packed with thunderous action, music, thrill, emotions, comedy and of course, a cool and dramatic screenplay.In this film, Akki plays the role of Boss which is no less than a superhero. The way he jumps, climbs, runs and fights gives the impact of a superhero image of Akki. The special effects are awesome,especially in the fight between Boss and henchmen-the way sand is shown in slow motion,it appears to be like a storm. The fights are very good. The performances by Akki, Mithun, Shiv and of course, Ronit Roy are awesome. Jonny Lever is also good and energetic as always.On the whole, Boss is a perfect film to watch. Superb entertainer!" 
" The BOSS is always right!!!","BOSS is a clear departure from previous Akshay starrers , yet it has everything that spectators look for in masala fares in fact, BOSS is a fast-moving roller-coaster ride that gives you no time to think. It offers entertainment by the bucketful and celebrates the formula with panache. Director Anthony D'Souza who failed so miserably in "Blue", here rises out of the deep to deliver a full-blast rabble-rouser. Every moment in "Boss" is a celebration of cinematic conventions derived from decades of Bollywood entertainment. This is a fast-paced, zany, full-on masala fare. There is a tempting swagger to Akshay's performance matched by the narration's tidal tempo. Irresistible energy and endearing gusto underline the show's voracious appetite for a comic kill. On the whole, BOSS is a full-on masala entertainer that's very clear of its intent. It is designed to magnetize lovers of desi commercial cinema and woo the BO. If you savor and relish old-school masaledaar entertainers, BOSS is sure to win you over. Watch this one -- it's a paisa vasool entertainer! Ekdum fit hai, Boss!" 
" This is anything but the Cinema, this is the reason why I keep away from Bollywood Entertainers.","Its just not me to review such titles but I'll keep it crisp this time.The movie is hell of a disaster in terms of story, screenplay, execution, camera-work, cinematography, editing and what not.I am one of the huge fans of Akshay Kumar. This guy has the kind of potential which you will hardly get in the whole industry but channelization of what you are blessed with is equally important to create the magic in your work where Mr. Kumar lacks like anything. Whenever I watch his movie, I wonder why he signed it at first place, I mean 20 years in the industry and you cannot make the right choices..SHAME.The movie has nothing to talk much about. A cliché, stereotype bollywood masala. A guy abandoned by his father due to misunderstandings and picked up by a contractor messiah by chance. 15 years and yet he is not in touch with his father till consequences lead his father to give a contract to 'Boss' (Akshay) to kill the inspector Ayushmann (Ronit Roy). What next is that follows a ride of ups and downs which has its moments of emotional content and breaks the stone to heal the wound between father and son. And the end is when everyone and everything is happy and at peace. FIN.There is nothing to cheer about in the movie apart from 2 songs..'Do lafz ki hain..' and 'PARTY all night' which is stunning and terrific..brilliant camera angles and great choreography topped with youthful and zealous lyrics and Yo-Yo Honey Singh's electro-live voice. The rap had me tapping feet on floor. The next good thing is performance of Ronit Roy as a corrupt inspector. I've been his fan since 'Udaan' and he was yet again carrying the maturity in such a senseless movie like Boss.I'd rate it 2/10 for its non-sense script, creepy execution, and characters that are loud in a strange fashion.P.S - Don't waste the time with this. This is cinema...NOT." 
" Same movie that comes every Friday with different actors","Akshay Kumar has taken an oath to laugh at his own one-liners, do mindless comedies, do gravity defying action scenes, some songs by Honey Singh and all other cheap techniques. Every Friday there is a movie like this, Actors, Directors and Producers or for that matter all the crew members are taking the ingredients from Masala Movie template and cashing the receipts of money. There is something seriously wrong with our Film Industry because they have many movies on the floors; they are merely interested in good cinema. Akshay Kumar has done a great job but he is gradually diminishing his own image.'Boss' (Akshay Kumar) who becomes a mobster serving jail in his childhood. His father (Mithun Chakraborty) has parted ways from him and doesn't want to see his face again. Surya's younger brother Shiv (Shiv Pandit) is in police custody due and ACP Ayushman Thakur (Ronit Roy) abhors him, as Shiv loves Ayushman's sister Ankita (Aditi Rao Hydari). No Boss has to save his brother because blood is thicker than water.It is a remake of Malayalam movie 'Pokkiri Raja 2010', which itself a very bad movie. The writing is absolutely absurd because many things come and go without any significance. Akshay Kumar enters the screen after 30 minutes and gets the he is the only person on the screen. Jokes and punches are lame, forced songs give screenplay a hard time to manage the narrative.Sanjay Mishra & Johnny Lever have been wasted completely. Mithun and Danny do what is required. Shiv and Aditi love track never impresses as they both look indifferent. Shiv Pandit has done an astounding Job is "Shaitan" and he should probably refrain from such roles.The show stealer is "Ronit Roy" as a menacing and ruthless ACP; he delivers the dialogs the perfect body language. He is the only thing which sticks in the mind.There are some of the scenes which make you laugh. Otherwise it is really a headache to hear the overdone dialogs and emotional scenes.Overall, it the same movie that comes every Friday with different actors and crew." 
" Boss is a passable entertainer with raw-punching dialogues, commendable action scene and of course Akshaye Kumar ruling the roost","The sad news is that every Bollywood cinema like Besharam, Phata Poster Nikla Hero, Policegiri are following the trend of 80's potboilers which comprised of action, melodrama , routine song and dance. The good news is Boos , though falls into same genre, is a passable entertainer with raw-punching dialogues, commendable action scene and of course Akshaye Kumar.Boss ( Akshaye Kumar) is a fearless and heart-of-gold goonda who gets the contract to bump off a college going innocent chap Shiv( Shiv Pandit) in love with a gruesome police-office's sister. Coincidently, Shiv turns out to be younger brother of Boss who was estranged from him when his father ( Mithun Chakrborty) disowned him as a child.From terrible attempt BLUE , Anthony D'Souza comes back with a popcorn masala entertainment which had nothing new to offer in terms of direction and screenplay yet can be enjoyable in parts. These kind of cinemas generally does not have moral story and sense but they do have section of audience who loves to whistle to introduction scene of their hero, clap to the item songs and shout as their hero punches the villain. Similarly, Boss has everything going in its favor. The humongous entry by Akshay Kumar arriving with ten trucks, the brilliant fight sequence captured in slow motion ( though sometimes larger-than- life),the father-son melodrama summarizes Boss, few comic relief by Akshay Kumar and good songs with "Party All Night" being pick of the lot. Boss completely belongs to Akshay Kumar and the actor does not leave any stone unturned. He gives his best and proves his mettle with good performance. Ronit Roy is superb as rude and heartless cop. Danny and Mithun are just fine.Overall, Boss is a complete masala package with Akshay Kumar ruling the roost. Good 3/5" 
" Bakvaas Boss","watched BOSS ..I don't know what'sup with Bollywood these days..that every next actor here wants to be Chuck Norris & Rajnikanth or maybe even one step ahead of em...every week we have a movie like this which defies every logic n intelligence of common viewer..this flick is one of them....NOW this 2hours+30minuts long film actually starts after 40mins of its beginning..before that its mainly just intro of the characters(I find that useless & underused)..after that the journey of preposterously predictable plot proceeds...throughout the film actors throw up their self parsing dialogues in fake Haryanvi accent(sounds dull)..the movie is also a combo of useless songs which obviously makes it long(Holy-Cow I rhymed!)..talented cast remains unused cause of it & in the end its climax is so BAKVAS that it doesn't left any AAS(hope) for it....ONLY good thing about this film is Ronit Roy he did a tremendous job(as per the first time villain) STILL I say _YOU SHOULD NOT WATCH_" 
" Time-Pass!","Anthony D'Souza's 'Boss' is Time-Pass! An entertaining joyride, that is filled with super action, a dose of comedy & some wonderfully heartfelt moments.'Boss' Synopsis: A hero of his town comes to a city to rescue his brother from an evil cop.'Boss' has a good first-hour, but an awesome second. Keeping in mind this is a commercial film, the film succeeds big time by keeping the viewing engrossed. The Screenplay is well-done. The emotional father-son track is heartfelt, the comedy is spot-on & the action-sequences are mind-blowing. 'Boss' is a colorful entertainer that offers what it promises, which is entertainment. Anthony D'Souza's Direction is decent. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Music by various artists is super.Performance-Wise: Mithun Chakraborty is outstanding, as always. Akshay Kumar plays Boss, marvelously. He's energetic & lovable throughout. Shiv Pandit is credible. Ronit Roy is excellent as the dirty cop. Danny is wonderful. Aditi Rao Hydari looks gorgeous & delivers ably. Johnny Lever & Sanjay Mishra provide genuine laughs. Parikshit Sahni is adequate. Govind Namdeo & Aakash Dabhade are okay.On the whole, 'Boss' is a Winner." 
" Boss","Boss Review: movie started with Amitabh voice which was really incredible and Denny part too. then one by one entry of all star cast,every entry part is too good specially Joney & Ronit but bit disappoint with late entry of Akhay Kumar but so far best entry. And style of BOSS is best part in movie. when all songs came one by one your leg and head start shaking with it. then unwanted part of flashback is not suitable at that stage of the movie. till interval it's avg. after that the story took actually good move. in whole movie two characters BOSS & AYUSHMAN THAKUR are really increase the value of your 2 hours. Akshay with his purely kind hearted,lovable,fun to watch Gangster and Ronit Roy with his not really lovable actually not at all, dare to watch Acp Bollywood mas-ala movie climax and end as we all know fighting scene and family drama hero-villain-hero-villain but hero smashed...!Best parts : Akshay Kumar and Ronit Roy acting,funny parts,cinematography,action scenes,.dialogs and how to forget songs this parts makes BOSS at it titleBad parts : romance of shiv,some melodrama,flash back part at unwanted stage and how to forget some flu-shy scene this parts make you to feel-flush all this part from the movie.LAST WORDS : this movie manage is title at some points it is not fully penny washable movie but some parts and scenes really do! this movie is cup of tea for those who likes real face of Bollywood i mean mas-ala movie just for fun and 2-3 hours enjoyment from your hectic life!! And you know very well which is your cup of tea & which is not...? choice is yours! enjoy!!"

All actors performance were top-notch . Direction was great.Director Anthony D'Souza leaves an impact BOSS is a full-on masala entertainer it's a paisa vasool entertainer! Fun-filled, hugely-enjoyable masala dossier" 
" "Bollywood Gets Its New Villain & He Is Not Prakash Raj" ♦ 55%","The above summary is quoted from the review of Karan Anshuman of Mumbai Mirror because it makes sense...Pokkiri Raja was funny as heck, maybe because the cast portrayal was ridiculously humorous. On the Bolly-hand, BOSS IS ludicrous where nothing is logical or scientific, but for the sake of entertaining, it DOES deliver content.Also, the songs are catchy & full of beats. Just because the plot is too shabby for the even grotesque story idea, There is no need to blabber about how bad your expectations were thwarted, is there? We aren't expecting potential cinema from the makers either. Talking about the goodness, Ronit Roy's villainy demeanor is terrific and after his Udaan & Ugly, I am sure he is a busy man. I enjoyed watching him.Akshay Kumar, for the first time, looked old on-screen. But his stunts were really good, not to mention how gravity-defying they were (Maybe because Cuaron's Gravity was playing in the next screen). Danny Denzongpa is good as well. And well, the women in here are puppets, no doubt.Cinematography & editing is fine, direction is average. Humor has been worked out, but in an attempt to induce more, the writers lost the road. Some jokes are just too irritating, thereby making dramatic scenes into a mockery.BOTTOM LINE: Although not much in this makes sense, it was a cool- afternoon watch. Recommended for people who have know what they have in store. 5.5/10. It doesn't bore.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?
