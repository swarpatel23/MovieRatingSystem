" COuld be better","This film is a remake of HOLLOW MANThe film has a simple story, earlier tried in DARNA MANA HAIThe film has some funny moments even Tusshar's characterization is well handle and realisticWhile the entire magic things he does are funny but the film lacks the edge of the seat feel and by the end gets boringThe sudden climax too is badPrawal Raman does a okay job Music is okayTusshar gets into the character perfectly and suits the role and acts very well Antra Mali is bad Govind Namdeo is okay Raghuveer Yadav is good," 
" Not bad but had greater potential",""Gayab", as it was made, was a reasonably well-crafted piece of work, but I believe that it could have reached higher lengths, had the writer spent a little more time planning the movie. What I liked about this movie was that it used appropriate camera angles, and the characters were well developed (Tusaar did a good job with his acting which was rather surprising) and finally, the initial theme was great. As the movie starts, it succeeds in compelling its viewers into experiencing an interesting series of events (i.e. the movie being about a salesman who is ignored by his parents, harassed by peers, feels inadequate etc etc). The climax of this movie for me was when he becomes invisible. I felt that this was executed very well in the movie. However, the downfall of the movie was the ending. In my opinion, this would have been a better version of the movie: 1.... Tusaar is a middle-classed salesman who hates his job and hates his life even more.2..... He has been ignored by his parents ever since he was a kid, and although he is now 25 years old, nothing has changed.3..... He does not have any true friends, as all the kids in his neighbourhood make fun of him, making him feel even more inadequate and complexed. 4..... The only thing he finds to be worthwhile in his life is a girl who he often fantasizes about. He observes her everyday from his window without her acknowledgement. He loves her.5..... One evening, having been frustrated the entire day as usual, he prays to God to make him invisible.6. He turns invisible. And begins to live his life the way he wants to, free from societal conventions. 7...... As he continues to live like this (i.e. being invisible), he begins to inadvertently embark on acts of crime, as a quest to accomplish his dream (i.e. the girl he loves). However, as he further indulges in crime, the more his crimes get noticed by the police, which leads to a cat and mouse game between the police and tusaar. 8..... Eventually, under the influence of the girl he loves, tusaar decides to give himself to the police and he is taken to prison and sentenced to be hanged. 9..... Tusaar is hanged.10..... Tusaar wakes up and realises that whatever happened was all in his mind. It was an escape from his mundane reality. He was not invisible, neither did he ever get to talk to the girl he loves, neither was he brave enough to accept being hanged.. he was plain old himself. The movie should have ended here...If the movie was shot this way, I believe it would have been much better because it's message would be that we all are victims of societal conventions and fail to live the way we want to live because we allow society to control our lives. Anyway, just my opinion...nothing else. I rate this movie a 6 however, if it was shot the way i wanted it to be shot, i would have given it a 8Thanks for reading" 
" Ram Gopal Varma does it again","Ram Gopal Varma executes his magic once again! Tackling a very different and difficult subject, the director does an excellent job in creating an entertaining film. We have all at one time or another as children imagined what it would be like to be invisible. Tusshar's character represents every person when they have felt depressed, lonely, and helpless, and Antra, their fantasy. Tusshar's daily frustrations leave him desperate enough to want to be invisible. His comic antics with his newly attained enchanted power are hilarious. Of course, "with every great power comes great responsibility."Gayab is an interesting adventure of how an ordinary boy experiments, uses, tricks, abuses, and changes with the power of invisibility. Oh, and please answer this question: What is so great about Antra Mali??" 
" cheated but oh well..","I like the film ending.. great to watch. But what initially set me to watch the film was the soundtrack especially this track called "tanha". Turns out, that track was not even shot in the film!!! I feel Disappointed & cheated since "Tanha" was a great track with a soothing, alluring voice of Sonu Nigam. Anyway, guess what? There is a Tamil version of the film called "Githan". It Had a different ending from Gayab with all the different songs from a different music director. So It probably had a different screenplay except the invisibility formula devised by original producer Ram Gopal Verma. Wonder what ending it had different from Gayab? Did Mr.Invisible get his gal?"
