" Horrible","It is one of most poorly made movies I have watched in a long time. Don't know what Sooraj Barjatya was thinking while making this one. No story, no theme, no soul, no sense, no base....what was this SirSalman you just did Bajrangi Baijaan, which is so good. Why did you have to do such a movie. What was the football match about. So unreal, so unwanted. Sonam Kapoor I thought could act when I saw Ranjhana, guess it was just a fluke. I am so disappointed because I have always loved Sooraj Barjatya's movies. Now next time I have to be really careful before watching his movies Sad and disappointed" 
" Worst and Boring Movie","This movie is one of the worst and most boring movies. They are so many songs which don't add anything to the narrative. This movie director Soraj Barjatya used to make hit movies in 1980s and 1990s is still living there and his craft has only gone worse as time has gone. This review contains spoilers , This movie is a story of a prince played by Salman who is having trouble in maintaining relationships with his family members. Due to a crooked CEO played by Armaan Kohli who always makes schemes to create division among the two brothers , young brother played by Neil Nitin Mukesh. Salman also has problems with his sister(Swara Bhaskar) and this takes toll on his relationship with his finacee (Sonam Kapoor). There is a plot to kill the prince , and how prince look alike Prem(Salman Khan) helps in saving the prince and unite the family forms the rest of the movie. The music is bad and lyrics are the worst ever in Bollywood. Waste of 2 hours 30 minutes of your life if u watch this movie." 
" The most Boring Movie I have ever seen.","The first half of PRDP flows very slow and the story moves along boringly whilst establishing the characters. The biggest problem with the movie is that the conflict doesn't seem to be too big for it to matter later on when the conflict gets solved.Prem Dilwale's too much overacting makes the film irritate you like hell. The football match sequence and the sequence where Prem mends the relationship of Vijay with his step-sisters are completely over the top ones. There are a lot of illogicalness like the placement of a palace on the edge of a waterfall. At the end of the 160 minute duration, PRDP manages to make everyone sleep and the emotions do not work at all which should in turn make the film not work even amongst the family audiences. PRDP looks completely outdated and clearly no money has been spent on the sets and the costumes. The production design is of very low standards. The VFX work is the worst you have seen in Hindi films and the editing could have been much more tighter but as we all know, Sooraj Barjatya believes in boring cinema. Himesh Reshammiya delivers a pathetic soundtrack. None of the songs stay with the viewer. And the worst one is the title track which seems to be nowhere. Each and every actor completely overacts and the one who does the most throughout the movie is Salman himself. Prem Ratan Dhan Payo can't even be thought of to be compared with classics like 'Maine Pyaar Kiya' and 'Hum Aapke Hain Koun'. The film thoroughly bores you with dull moments all over. Sure there are a lot of silly and illogical moments. And Salman Khan puts in a terrible performance as Prem Dilwala. In the first half of the film, he irritates you over time and again. Diwali is the time when families come together and PRDP will be disliked even by families as it is the most boring movie which irritates you with overacting. This festive season, avoid it for sure. It's a 0/10 rating movie to be honest, but have to give 1/10 as 0/10 is not allowed on IMDb. Sooraj Barjatya films come once in 6-7 years and there is no director in the industry who can fill a film with as much overacting as much as the he can. Advice for the youth, don't even watch it on your on TV." 
" Hard to believe 'Bollywood' is still making such clich√©d movies","Damn, when will we ever learn? Well even before asking this, I knew the sad answer. I could not bear to watch more than half an hour of this worthless piece of s**t. The abundantly used & reused script, the all good pauper, the double role, the unnecessary songs, the out of sync pathetic & outdated soundtrack, the forced upon villains of the film & Salman's usual overacting were too much for me to handle. This whole movie is way too outdated and seems like a movie from the late 80's. The screenplay and the coincidental scenes of blossoming love between Salman (50 year Old) & Sonam (20 Years Younger) were irritatingly naive and dated. I beg to the film makers to grow up and stop testing our I.Q. already. Please have mercy on us. But then again, why would they ever stop! It's hard to believe but true that this movie has already done Box office collections nearing 200 Cr. as of yet (i.e. today : 17th Nov). 'Bhai's' Fan following from the masses in India surely encourages them to keep making these overrated pieces of junk repeatedly. I usually check the rating and make an educated guess after reading some reviews from IMDb website. But then again, the fans of these glorified actors have infiltrated deep within IMDb too and misleading gullible movie watchers to go ahead and watch these kind of movies. The wish that the censor board rate movies on I.Q. levels too. I guess I'll stick to my thought of staying away from Bollywood movies, cause while watching such crap, I tend to get frustrated and uneasy. Rest, this is my thinking on this, you take your own call. Caution : Proceed to theaters at your own risk!!!" 
" Seriously?","I made a personal history with this film: it is the first film ever in my life during which I took a break to offer prayers without pausing the film. I just let it run so that the torture less a few minutes less for me.But I must add here though that I watched this film with constant smile and laughter, just thinking how can anyone come up with such a piece of nonsense.Two worst things were the music, and was like 38 songs I think(!), and the almost three-hour long length of the film. Both of these should be logged as criminal offences in my view.And no, I don't wish to simply make fun of Sooraj Barjatya thinking that his films are not meant for this age and era, because I am sure he can come up with better stuff than this at least. This too hasn't got bad basis: a person in place of another one whose much more calm and loving approach allows him to tackle things in a better way. But everything surrounding this idea and even the application of this itself is plan nonsense." 
" Abysmally Awful","So terrible. Even the trailer was unbearable, couldn't expect anything better from the actual movie. The better side of the picture is that I went to PVR and had a deep and interesting conversation with my friends. The popcorn wasn't too bad either. The only good thing about the movie is that the set design and cinematography was vibrant and looked amazing. The movie is filled with unnecessary 6 minute songs but has a 2 minute paper-thin plot. I'm flabbergasted by how well this movie is doing, just cause of Bhai fun club. Congrats Bhai, you have done it again. You keep churning sh!t, every year, be it Eid or Diwali. Thenks!" 
" Total Disappointment.","This is truly one of the worst Bollywood films I have ever had the misfortune to have had to watch. Having seen the trailer I was expecting a proper bollywood flick choc-a- bloc filled with culture, tradition and well...a plot! The characters are all boring and one dimensional and I found myself not caring about any of them and wishing someone would die or something so the film would hurry up and end. Nonsense, pure nonsense. The one decent song which was played in trailer was the only part of the film that was mildly entertaining. Total waste of money, I recommend waiting for the DVD release, because otherwise you'll be left feeling cheated." 
" Worth Watching","Some reviews don't give this film the credit it deserves, to appreciate the film you need to be able to relate to it, as everything in life, if you don't relate to it then you won't understand it. It's another film based on a character that will do whatever it takes to help out others without expecting anything in return, that in itself is something that is very rare nowadays and something every selfish person will find stupid. We live in a world where most people are have the mentality "what's in it for me" if you have that mentality you won't enjoy the film. If you appreciate your friends, family and even those you don't know but you can see they're unhappy and would like to see their problems go away and be happy, then this film is something that you would enjoy." 
" A Bit Regressive Here, a Bit Outdated There, but Innocently Endearing and Naively Charming on the Whole","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3/5 stars"Prem Ratan Dhan Payo" flows freely and the story moves along nicely whilst establishing the characters. However, the biggest problem with the film lies in its conflict, which doesn't seem to be too problematic to really evoke concern later on when everything gets resolved. But this doesn't create an issue with the proceedings because Salman Khan's Prem Dilwale character keeps us entertained with his innocent antics and simplistic charm. Most of the audiences should love Salman's act.The climax between the dual characters of Salman and Neil Nitin Mukesh, and the scene where the doppelganger Prem posing as Prince Vijay Singh mends ties with the prince's step-sisters stand out as real tearjerkers. There are a few absurdities like the placement of a palace on the edge of a waterfall, and a few dialogues and actions sound and feel regressive as well as outdated. Additionally, though the movie looks opulent, and clearly a lot of money has been spent on the sets and the costumes, the visual effects aren't the best you've seen as compared to recent Bollywood fare, and the editing could have been tighter, too, but as we all know, Director Sooraj Barjatya believes in excesses, which isn't such a bad thing considering the timing of the film's release.Nevertheless, at the end of its 160 minute duration, "Prem Ratan Dhan Payo" manages to make everyone smile, and the emotional moments work in their own innocuous, innocent, albeit naive way. The film thoroughly entertains with very few dull moments if you can immerse yourself in the world depicted on-screen." 
" Most Overrated Movie and a waste of time","If you have huge time to waste then it's a must watch movie. I can't understand how the critics (so called as per IMDb) gave it higher ratings than 1. In five days it crossed 150 Cr mark. No doubt the movie Happy New year did it almost in the same way which is also similar in quality. Action sequences were funny.Story line was boring. Emotions were fake. No proper climax was there. And last but not the least the ending was super funny (negation). Salman Khan is just wasting his carrier in it. It doesn't fall in any category of Indian movies. My advice is don't waste your money on this. The interesting fact is that it doesn't even deserve 10 lines of review (which is mandatory for IMDb)." 
" Felt Like I Was Watching an Indian Serial...Terrible Even for Salman Khan","It is tough for me to even give 2/10 to this movie. The entire movie had roughly 45 minutes of content, but was 3 hours long. The movie progressed at a very slow pace, and the direction style was very similar to how serials are directed in India (yuck). Everything was overdramatized, and I'm surprised I didn't internally combust while watching this expensively made crap put on a screen. Apart from Bhajrangi Bhaijaan, all Salman Khan movies have been the same for the past 10 years, and most of them have been pretty bad. Props to Salman for doing something different than the stereotypical mindless action movies he does, but this was probably his worst movie in the past 10 years (yes even worse than his typical mindless action movies). Salman may get to a point where he can act and make good movies one day, but this will be one of the biggest stains on his record." 
" blockbuster Jodi back again","so the blockbuster Jodi is back again . we all know that rajshree productions always have family audience in their mind while making a movie.yet again they are successful in making a good family movie . movie is well made with mix of comedy , emotion and family drama . movie is getting mix reviews as per from our critics but as per our public reviews are concerned ..they are tremendous in favour of prem ratan dhan payo . this is a story which will make every person think about their relationship with their family . Yet again sooraj barjatya showed why he is best director in family genre. the public which are giving their money to watch prem ratan dhan payo will enjoy their time in the movie theatre. so at last i wanna say don't leave the opportunity to watch such a wonderful movie at big screen ..go for it ..its a sure shot blockbuster." 
" A low IQ movie, don't believe those 10/10 fake reviews!","Again a super 3rd class movie by so called superstar Salman.this movie starts with good gesture and classic 90's scene so that one can hope for a good movie. But sooner movie becomes TV serial type of concept. If you are planning to see this movie because of its earning at box office then you are going to get fooled. This foolish and low IQ movie has nothing to offer except a mental trauma. Acting wise Salman has again proved he has no skills to establish himself as an actor, same goes for the actress they both are awful.sooraj takes the advantage of Salman's star power as he had done nothing to make the movie worthy.I didn't thought that sooraj will make a nonsense of this type. Looks like Bollywood is in really bad and irresponsible hands." 
" What's wrong with a simple, feel good movie?","As has been mentioned this is a take on the Prince and the Pauper story that may not appeal to those who are into art films and like to sit around discussing and dissecting a film's philosophical nuances. If, on the other hand, you simply like a fun story, gorgeous sets, and yes, the occasional over-the-top scene, this can be a thoroughly enjoyable tale of a man who is willing to put the woman he loves ahead of himself. I speak neither Hindi nor Punjabi, so I can only go by what I read into the English subtitles, and the first ones I had were out of sync by 20 to 60 seconds which was a bit confusing to say the least, but after obtaining a proper sub file I enjoyed the show." 
" Feeling all Loved up!","'All the darkness's that were there around me, they have all gone.. I also earned the value of all the dreams and all the relations.. I understood love... no one cared for me like you did.. when your color touched me, I became a wonderFilm: Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (Bollywood) Cast: Salman Khan, Sonam Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Swara Bhaskar, Anupam Kher, Armaan Kohli, Deepak Dobriyal Director: Sooraj Barjatyatoo.With what was happening outside in the world I decided I wanted to escape from the horrible reality that I woke up to and indulge myself in some of Salman Khan's motto 'Being Human' and fantasize about how the world should be.Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (PRDP) is definitely a tear jerker but are they tears of joy? This film is a case of a 'doppelg√§nger' - any person who physically or behaviorally resembles another person. You've guessed it 2 for the price of one! A tale with a twist - The Prince and the Pauper . One is a suave and sophisticated prince and the other is a simple, generous man. Without giving too much away I have to say I really enjoyed PRDP it was light hearted, funny, colorful, sensitive, a family film that would not offend anybody.This film was a Royal treat not just with all the Laddoo's and Jalebi's on display due to Diwali but because of the message that was clear and to the point -Family is important , any differences should be put aside for the sake of humanity,I came out feeling all hopeful and loved up!Ms Safirah Irani Twitter@Safirah63" 
" Waste of Time And Money.Do yourself a favor and skip it.","Absolutely Disastrous to say the least. Bollywood keeps churning one crap after another. Salman seriously needs acting lessons. One of the top actors supposedly but zero acting.His dialogue delivery is weak and extremely annoying. Sonam cannot act to save her life. Instead of wasting money on brand name clothes wish she would invest in some acting classes. Waste of Time and Money. Neil nitin can act but has minimal screen presence. And I cannot fathom someone wanting to watch Armaan Kohli in a movie. Why can't a movie have someone decent who can actually act and no there because of family name? Salman,Sonam,Armaan etc need to retire."
