" Humorous","It was a boring weekend, since I exhausted all options of watching Hollywood movies last week. This was the only option I had. And after struggling with my conscious I convinced myself to go for this movie.AND IT WAS NOT A WRONG DECISIONThis movies is an example of making Bollywood realize how important script is.A perfectly executed masterpiece. And example that comedy can be without using words. All the characters have done their job. I personally like the Editor of Danka TV.Very Humorous." 
" At last we get a good comedy moving ahead of the regular Priyadarshan and Golmaal ventures.","Its good news for all Comedy genre lovers as here comes a fine tuned comic flick with some great performances after a long time. Out of all the genres of film-making I consider Comedy as the toughest one since each individual viewer has his own kind of sense of humor and it's really tough to make everyone laugh at the same time. Any comic attempt can easily go over the top if not equipped with some right, powerful and timely punches. And if you are dealing with a concept based on the identity of the world's most famous personality OSAMA BIN LADEN then the vision of its makers really matter a lot.Fortunately "TERE BIN LADEN", comes up as a clear winner, offering you a highly enjoyable time in the theater with a fresh and daring subject. As a sigh of relief at last we get a well written comedy to enjoy, where people are not just running after one another or greeting each other with mistaken identities as seen in countless comedies in the last few years. The movie once again proves a strong point of film-making that a pleasing project solely depends upon its writing, script and execution more than its star-cast. The fact was earlier proved decades before by "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron" and more recently by "Khosla Ka Ghosla". Now "TERE BIN LADEN" proves it once again, as the common man is appreciating it, even when he is not familiar with any of the faces seen on the screen.Based on the subject of creating a fake personality of OSAMA and then shooting his forged tapes to earn some quick bucks, the film is immensely likable right from its first sequence of deporting the lead hero by mistake. The other big factor which becomes an instant hit with the viewers is its perfect casting where every characters is able to bring in some more laughter with his own unique lines. For instance, the Channel owner, the helpless editor, the witty cameraman, the makeup girl and the voice over artist, each one of them has a different quality to win over the audience. And on top of all there is Ali Zafar, the hero with his impeccable timing and Pradhuman Singh who is made to pose as the fake OSAMA in a highly hilarious manner.Beside this, what really works is the mixed language used in the movie with insertions of Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi lines written intelligently. In fact it's the Punjabi abusives used by Pradhuman dressed as OSAMA which makes you laugh aloud and you really want him to keep abusing at regular intervals. Yes, the movie does take some huge liberties while showcasing the retaliation of White House (after watching the forged tapes). But if you are dealing with a theme on OSAMA then America and White house has to be there as a mandatory clause. So, considering it as a hilarious satire on the system, it's a fine funny take on the whole world fighting with the current situation of terror.A comedy mainly works, when a well crafted script gets an ample support from its performers and they all have a good time working together. Luckily, that is the main USP of "Tere Bin Laden" where everyone gels together perfectly and contributes a lot to the overall experience.Frankly speaking, performance wise, the movie was a pleasant surprise for me as I knew Ali Zafar, the lead hero of the film, only as a talented singer-composer and Pop Icon of Pakistan. He did a successful pop album for us in India titled "MASTY"and you might remember the hit song from the album called "Sun Ri Sajaniya". But I never knew that Ali had such a hidden acting talent in him. He is surely the find of the season for both India and Pakistan and should soon be getting more deserving offers of acting.Among the rest of the cast, Pradhuman Singh as OSAMA is too funny playing with his Sikander (the chicken). The film could have fallen flat if he would have faltered in his role of a fake OSAMA. But he is simply superb looking exactly similar to the real one. Piyush Mishra, Sugandha Garg, Nikhil Ratnaparkhi, Rahul Singh and Chirag Vohra as a collective team are all terrific. Berry John gives another controlled performance of a US representative. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music supports the feel and pace of the movie completely. The music grows on you and as the end credits are rolling you feel like loving it. Cinematography is fine but the dialogues and its one liners are just fantastic.In all, I could only find one small glitch in this almost perfect movie, related to its main region of operation. The film confusingly keeps shifting between different regions of India and Pakistan. With its major characters and sequences representing the neighboring region it gives you a feeling of a collaboration kind of project which is sadly not mentioned anywhere in the film credits. So the unexplainable regional disparities in backgrounds, getups and physical appearances remain the only hick-up in this immensely likable comedy.If "Khosla Ka Ghosla" gave us Dibaker Banerjee then "Tere Bin Laden" has given us another ace debutant writer-director Abhishek Sharma. And I am really expecting more worth watching movies coming from him pretty soon. So, stop thinking and just go for it with your entire family at the earliest and have a good time.("Tere Bin Laden" also finds its place in my "Movie To See Before You Die" list as its an out of the box comedy based on a rare and daring concept never tried before.)" 
" Hilariously Intelligent","Tere Bin Laden (TBL) reminded me of Pakistan's win in the 2009 T20 cricket world cup. No, it's not a movie about cricket but it has the same formula for success where Abhishek Sharma is the captain steering the ship with zeal, there is team effort from five to six individual players and then there is a certain Ali Zafar who acts as 'Shahid Afridi' catalyst for the victory.Out of the 120 minutes I sat in the theater, without exaggeration I had a smile for 70 minutes and I laughed for 40 minutes. Agreed that I am a compulsive laugher, it still was rib-tickling. It's not a senseless Akshay Kumar comedy of errors, mind you. It's an intelligent satire and a different take on the terrorism threat the world is facing. More importantly, it delivers the message of peace more interestingly than the over-doing films like My Name is Khan and New York, both of which I did not enjoy much.First ten minutes into the film and you know that you are up to. The toilet scene in the beginning and Ali's attempts in the plane to copy CNN accents are funny. As the movie progresses and story unfolds, the joy rides keep getting funnier. At the interval, it looked fantastic but I feared that it might go down in the second half. Fortunately, it did not. The best thing is that it's not dragged unnecessarily and is shorter than your normal Hindi films.The movie marks the arrival of Ali Zafar, who will probably become the first major successful Pakistani actor in bollywood considering that TBL has already grossed over 10 crores at the Indian box office. His screen presence is phenomenal; his confidence is that of a veteran, his smile is lightening; his comic timing can put some so-called entertainers of bollywood to shame. Not even once he goes overboard and takes the movie on his shoulders throughout. His slightly Punjabi-accented-Urdu at times left a bit to think but that does not bother as it has no significance on the story. It will be interesting to see how he fares in his next movies, which I am sure he will get after this performance. He should. There was only one scene that could come remotely close to being emotional, hence, his serious portrayal could not be judged. Ali, in TBL, is absolutely fantastic. I would not be surprised if he bags a couple of new-comer awards at the end of the year.Abhishek Sharma is another new star to the list of debutant directors after Nishikan Kamat (Mumbai Meri Jaan), Sriram Raghavan (Johnny Gaddar) and Neeraj Pandey (A Wednesday) but he has taken a totally different route as compared to them. His attention to details is amazing. He carries some jokes throughout the movie (The Pappu Umbrella that opens downwards and not upwards) without giving a feeling that it's dragged. His focus on out-of-focus actors on the screen is exemplary. Just like Ali, I am sure we will see a lot more of him in future. Casting Ali for his first film also turned out to be a master stroke. The storytelling is without loopholes.The other actors contribute with sincerity. Saugandha gets the biggest role of her career thus far as Zoya and does better than what she did in Jaane Tu and Let's Dance. The look-alike of Bin Laden (Pradhuman Sing) is hilarious. His scenes with Saugandha leave you in giggles. His Arabic and Punjabi are funny. Imagine Bin Laden singing with a girl 'HABIBI GEORGE BUSH'. Ali's partner, the cameraman, is as good a comedian as it gets.Cinematography is nothing to write home about but the art director needs pats on the back for creating Karachi like he did. Olper's buntings on the shops and Dr. ZIauddin Road on the walls was brilliant.Even when the movie was over, I kept sitting to see the final credits and guess what; it offered more when it unfolded the future of those characters an all-spiky Bin Laden! The downside of the movie eh? What downside? TBL was hilarious. I enjoyed every bit of it and would love to watch it again and again." 
" A light movie that is sure to drop you off your seat!","I watched the movie very recently, and personally I wasn't expecting anything out of it. I am a dedicated hater of Bollywood comedy movies, as I personally find them stupid, impractical and even worthless. Even after reading good reviews I did not have the slightest urge to go and give Tere Bin Laden a try. But however I had to experience it forcefully. After watching it was shocked to find that it was hell funny! It used the typical Pakistani-Punjabi accent that made the movie very realistic and had a nice selection of talented actors. The person who played the Osama Bin Laden look-alike himself acted very nicely and gave us an impression of a simple and innocent man with an amazing sense of humor. The movie also had a nice share of practicality (although the whole idea of the movie is superbly impractical). The characters are properly portrayed. The language was used properly, the Americans were provided where they were needed, the makeup of the look-alike was brilliant and there was many-many practical jokes. The Punjabi jokes were brilliant and the comic timing was good. The only problem with the movie was that the idea was very impractical, but keeping in mind that this is a comedy movie (and the fact that its humor covers up its short falls), I would like to ignore that. A combination of amazing jokes, great acting and slight impracticalities result in me giving this movie a 7/10 or 3.5/5 stars." 
" This Osama Will Make You Fall Laughing","Reading Such Good Reviews, Expectations got higher for this flick. The main reason of high expectations is nothing but the never heard before, honest & hilarious concept. OSAMA BIN LADEN - The name that is so famous that while writing it in any Data sheet in computer, there comes no "UNKNOWN SPELLING" underline. But this time he is not the source of terror, in fact he is not in the film. Then Who's The LADEN in "Tere BIN LADEN"? A Fake of course. Such authentic & comic concept was never thought before. Nearly 9 years passed from "9/11", many films are made on this historic event like "NEW YORK", "KURBAAN" & Many More. But "TERE BIN LADEN", doesn't bring up the concept once again, here the main suspect of the 9/11 conspiracy is brought up and in a very funny concept. Though The film has already fallen into many troubles but "Tere Bin Laden" is highly recommended for it's fresh concept and some pure humor.In recent times, Comedy only means non-veg, double meaning jokes, abusing each other, misunderstandings, slapping each-other furiously, funny proverbs etc. etc. But "Tere Bin Laden" has introduced Comedy in a fresh package with some not-so-cheesy but damn funny dialouges, Cock- kicks, Chicken-Kabab Blasts, Laden make-ups, Carrot eating FBI Agents & many more like that. The Introductory Song "Good Looking Ullu Da Paththa" makes u start laughing and this journey continues till the end. Without lavish sets, beautiful foreign sites, too much budget, unnecessary songs - "Tere Bin Laden" amazes us by its great wit, slapstick script & some biting dialouges.PLOT - Ali Hassan(Ali Zafar) & His Friend Gul(Nikhil Ratnaparkhi) are two luckless Pakistani reporters of a disgusting TV- channel "Danka TV". Ali is very desperate to go USA, The Land Of Opportunities to try his luck to become like A CNN & BBC Reporter or a very big man. But His Visa Applications are rejected several times. In Deep desperation, a weird idea catches his mind after seeing the LADEN Look-alike Noora(Pradhuman Singh). By The Help of make-up artist Zoya(Sugandha Garg), Ali turns Noora into Osama Bin Laden & takes his video & sells it to his boss Majeed(Piyush Mishra). From here, Ali's plan backfires & terrible confusions come up.MUSIC - "ULLU DA PATHTHA" & "I LOVE AMREEKA" are tremendous. Great vocals by Shankar Mahadevan. Even the Ali Zafar Track "Bas Ek Soch" is missing in the film, it's beautiful. Besides Singing, This Good Looking Paki Boy is to watch out for in the future for good acting & nicely made stupid expressions what was needed for the movie. Rest Songs like "Shor Sharaba", "Kukduku" are fare.ACTING - Debutant Paki Singer Ali Zafar has done very nice job and for his naughty & stupid expressions made in the movie are very cool. This Boy can work wonders in future. Fake Osama, Pradhuman Singh was also a man to watch out for because of his great face that can be easily mistaken as Osama and his stupendous and confusing expressions made in some places. Excellent! Sugandha Garg, Piyush Mishra & rest others are also nice.DIRECTOR - A big round of applause for this young wonder named Abhishek Sharma to come out. He has amazed us by his capabilities as a founder of this out-of-the-box concept in Bollywood ever. The way the film is conceptualized by a small idea and made into a belly-tickler is astounding. Some new ideas like "Hen Screaming Competition", "Osama Spoof" are just tremendous. We will expect him gravely in future.VERDICT - In recent times, when most of comedy movies are coming up, "Tere Bin Laden" is completely different from them in concept and humor. It entertains us from the first to last by its brilliant script, hilarious situations and hard punch-lines. But at box-office, it has a probability to fall down because of controversies relating it. But it's highly entertaining & a non-stop laughter machine. So, don't miss it at any cost & join this laughathon." 
" Short, Precise and Funny","Abhishek Sharma ( don't actually know the guy) has made a fine debut with this adorable flick . Trite and well edited, the movie leaves a good impression throughout. Yes there are a few stale patches in between but that doesn't adversely affect the comic credibility of the movie . The cast does justice to the movie's theme. Ali Zafar may have been the protagonist but it is the guy who plays Laden's look alike who out does almost everyone else. A fine satire , not holding back anything, the movie is the newest member of the Political Satire Flicks.The movie also scores highly when it comes to editing. The editing team is allergic to superfluous stuff and that is such a relief. No sentimentality's without a reason and no stretch outs. Definitely a one time watch if not more." 
" A Legendary Watch!","Making someone laugh is hard, but making someone fall off his/her chair is, according to me, the hardest exercise. Nowadays, Indian Cinema's usual blockbusters have been Comedies. They have become the flavor of the season. Now add, 'Tere Bin laden' in that long-list. Comedy Films have a new nature to them - 'Tere Bin Laden'.Osama Bin Laden, surf this name in Google/Yahoo, and I can assure you... the results would pop-up in Millions. His rivalry with the World, his actions... have made him a man named with Violence or Terror. Now imagine, Osama Bin Laden playing in the fields with Chickens, Roaming around freely to relief himself or, him being a business partner in a rather tacky salon. Presto, now we're talking 'Tere Bin Laden'.'Tere Bin Laden' is a legendary watch, which I am sure would be regarded as a Cult-Classic in the coming years. It's a hilarious satire, that has a water-tight, witty Screenplay, Super Performances & Striking Direction in it's booty. About 95 minutes long, this one is truly a joyride! Abhishek Sharma's Screenplay is a pure genius. His direction styles as well. Santosh Thundiyil's Cinematography is nice. Music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy, is in sync with the film. Editing is neat.In the acting department, Ali Zafar excels in the lead role. The Pakistani Hunk is a treat to watch, as he gets it right from start to end. Pradhuman Singh as a mistaken Osama, is lovely. Sugandha Garg manages her part. Nikhil Ratnaparkhi is superb. But the actor who truly steals the show, is, Piyush Mishra. The Highly Talented Actor gets a terrific role, and does complete justice to it. In fact, his portions are the funniest! On the whole, 'Tere Bin Laden' is humorous, crazy, cinema at it's best. Two Big Thumbs Up!!" 
" This is called comedy","I saw this movie recently on DVD, the reason I did not go to theater was (actually were) new actor, new director, and the plot was also not so much thrilling, as 9/11 and Osama are not in news now.The main drawback of most Bollywood comedy flicks is, they do not have any plot at all, and most of them have only three things 1.Misunderstanding 2. Marathon of characters 3. Old or double meaning Jokes in place of dialogsThis film was nothing like old crap and to my surprise, I was completely wrong; the cast does justice to the movie's theme especially "Noora chacha" played by Pradhuman Singh and yes "Sikandar"(the chicken) too. Ali jafar with his impeccable timing is well suited in his first appearance in Bollywood. This is perfect platform for him to be launched in such a good movie.The main USP of "Tere Bin Laden" is a well-crafted script with total fresh idea and of course superb direction. What a debut for Abhishek Sharma. It is a satire on the system; it is a fine funny take on the whole world fighting with the terror. This is the movie you should watch with your friends or family if you want to double your experience of fun.And the last line: Don't read this, go watch movie and please do not watch it alone." 
" Only third Bollywood movie I gave 10, and there is a reason for it....","After "LAGAAN" and "3 IDIOTS", this is only 3rd Indian movie I rated as 10/10, and the rest of review explains why I rated it so..While India always has had wonderful actors like Amitabh , Naseer-ud-Din Shah and Aamir Khan, most of such talent is wasted because many Indian movies copy a lot, if you are a well-informed movie geek, you can identify a sequence copied from a classic Hollywood flick or some Giallo, as such movies make lots of gross in India but abroad they lose their charm as we know from ratings that biggest box office hits in Bollywood hardly pass 7 in IMDb ratings..But here and there the biggest film industry in terms of movies made produces absolute genius like the movies I mentioned, there are many more..TERE BIN LADEN is a no-brainer comedy with hilarious moments and equally compelling script and direction, and a totally original effort.The story starts with a Pakistani Journalist Ali (played by Pakistani pop-star Ali Zafar) who wants to go to USA and till the credits open, we know that his VISA has been rejected for 7 years (told in a funny way at how he tries to fool the immigration department), Ali works in a small news channel reporting small league press conferences and even cock- operas, he has a friend camera-man GUL (Nikhil RatnaParkhi) and a mean boss Majeed (Piyush Mishra), Ali gets an idea after watching a cock owner NOORA (Pradhuman Singh) and noticing his resemblance with BIN LADEN.He hires a Hair-Stylist ZOYA(Sughanda Garg) and Voice imitator, communist RJ QURESHI (Rahul Singh) , together they make a tape of Bin Laden and sell it to news, the rest movie tells the after effects of this and I won't spoil it , you have to enjoy it.The movie has a small message and asks a question about America's decisions, but it is lightly told so it doesn't effect the momentum of the movie.As for the performances, ALI ZAFAR was lucky to be cast in this, Pakistani Actors have never been lucky in Bollywood and he got such an original movie to launch his career, but its not to take anything off him, his performance is good, in some scenes he is hilarious while at others , he is just OK , but considering he is originally a singer, he didn't do bad. The pick of the cast and the person who makes this movie is PRADHUMAN SINGH whose USAMA lookalike character is heart and soul of the movie, he is funny, natural and carries the movie to whole new level in all the scenes he is featured, one of best debut performances. I would also like to mention Rahul Singh who plays Communist RJ Qureshi, he was also really funny and his physical gestures were really comic, the rest of cast, be it Ali's friends or police and FBI , are all on par.Now to the technical stuff, if this movie was 20 minutes longer, it would have been a plain turkey, but the 95 minute running time (about 5 minutes for credits) really keep your interest throughout without senseless sub-plots and gimmicks, the character of Ali is well developed and his love for America is into you in 10 minutes of the movie, the rest of cast are there to carry the plot, Abhishek Sharma who wrote the script and directed doesn't tell you unneeded stuff which slows down many Bollywood movies, like there is no extra prologue of NOORA and other characters, no annoying parents of Ali, all the characters and progression of movies is on the plot and the jokes are around the plot, which makes this movie great, such a good script needed excellent direction and here too Abhishek scores, with a low budget, he carries off the movie beautifully with short flashbacks and well-executed scenes, the Osama video is hilarious yet looks so original, I would love to see him doing bigger projects in future.For some Bollywood audiences , this might not be the dish but international audiences have liked the movie a lot and it is a big hit now, in India too it has grossed 120 million Rs. , I hope this movie doesn't get effected by net piracy and DVD's are genuinely sold, as the team of this movie deserves at least this for making such a laugh Galla, its 90 minutes worth of laughs and fun. Definitely recommended." 
" An outstanding and full on Comdey movie on Osama Bin Laden","TERE BIN LADEN – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Tere Bin Laden is a breeze of fresh air in the comedies, were these days all comedies are losing their stories and trying to cover up the story with big actors, comedic action and songs. This movie really makes you laugh with honest and entertaining performances by all the young actors. The whole movie is a fun ride from the first song 'Ullu Da Pattha" till the end song "I love Amreeeka". In such low budget they have made a really interesting and unique movie. Putting severe topic like Osama Bin Laden into comedy is itself an achievement. The whole movie is hilarious and full on comedy and one of the most entertaining sequences was the Rooster's Bang (Voice) Competition. Sikender the Rooster has stolen the show plus his death sequence is incredibly funny and I laughed my A** out. Ali Zafar is the heart of the movie with his cute face and brilliant comedic timing he made the movie incredibly entertaining. All the supporting actors Sugandha Garg, Pradhuman Singh,Nikhil Ratnaparkhi, Akash Dhar, Chinmay Mandlekar and Piyush Mishra were top notch, there could not have been a better cast then this. It's a brilliant attempt and must be seen by every person. Laugh Out Loud!" 
" Sikander Gave An Award Winning Performance,","Just Watched the movie Today, the Concept was Brilliant and the Laden fake worked just fantastic. And his Sikander was astonishing. Yup, the movie will be a bit disappointment for the American in some scenes but tolerable, overall this is not a laughter riot but a laughter ride, A light Movie to go for, Talking About the performance, the poor Laden Fake was fantastic and done his part of Job, and he was the most memorized character of the movie when you finished watching it, Ali Zafar was good for first Timer, but the Show Stealer was Pradhuman Singh, The Laden Fake,Final Verdict : If you have the Time, Go for it." 
" Cult Classic!!","Super film in all aspects... Usually, almost every good film starts well, but lags a little in its second hour... Even after this much efforts, most of the film makers are not able to overcome this problem... You can see a lag somewhere, in almost every film, whether its a classic or a crap...But, surprisingly Tere Bin Laden never showed such a trend, i don't remember which was the previous film that entertained me this much...The protagonist Ali Zafar is a complete discovery!!! Heard he is doing next film with Yashraj Films... All the best Ali, musically you are a genius, now you proved that acting wise also you are great... we want to see you more on screen..And Pradhuman Singh, who portrayed Noora (Laden) is perfect, and very good in his role... All other people were also very good...I don't want to say more, such films happen VERY VERY Rarely.... DO NOT MISS SUCH GEMS AT ANY COST..." 
" not good but excellent...","tere bin laden is totally awesome... it is full of comedy and is not stretched at all... this movie is far better than loads of priyadarshan comedy movies... it works because it has new jokes, amazing gags and a good story... something that is very original... hope bollywood cinema continues to make movies like this one... and laden(noore) in the movie is so comical, didn't expect this one to be so good but its excellent... All the actors have done a fabulous job and hats off to them for pulling it off so well, one of the best movie's of bollywood in 2010, i would go with a 9/10 and 2 thumbs up for ali zafar and the director... watch this one in the theatre and also on DVD, you won't regret it." 
" Brave and unabashed, a black comedy covering the clashing of cultures and egotistical mindsets in a delicate political age.","Abhishek Sharma's debut feature Without You, Bin Laden arrives with a great deal of both matter and controversy; banned in some nations, and begrudged in general due to its nature and its content, the 2010 black comedy about certain contemporary issues actually arrives with more of a brain and more of a heart than people give credit. Where accusations of exploitation and the general handling of delicate subjects in a manner that more broadly represents something that is anything but, Sharma's film is principally more inclined to be about characters doing such things rather than resembling a film prone to indulging in such things. The film is a really quite enjoyable and rather well played comedy about celebrification and ill-judged attitudes towards the garnering of fame through faux-successes; a piece that is, of sorts, a demonisation of the Capitalist mentality eventually seeing an individual place themselves first and foremost amidst a hotbed of political tension and pre-existent oneupmanship within a specific career field.The film opens mere days after the eleventh day of the month of September, the year 2001; the infamous date of the attacks unleashed upon the United States by a series of extremists. Tensions are high; hysteria, suspicion are omnipresent and the boss of a Pakistani based TV news network stands upon a runway at a Pakistani airport outlining the severity of the situation for us following this cataclysmic event in a manner suggesting it might be hard to thoroughly recall such a predicament ourselves - I suppose the event is long enough ago now for people of a younger disposition to be unaware of the fear and such that was born out of such a day's events. Additionally, a certain Ali Hassan (Zafar) works for the station; a man in the process of packing up his belongings and bidding adieu to those around him, namely partner-in-company Gul (Ratnaparkhi), he bids to leave for the U.S. with the line that "today" he "chases America", but that "tomorrow" America will "chase me", as he strives to make it within the American journalistic field .It isn't long, however, before Hassan is brought back to Earth; quite literally, finding himself grounded in Pakistan again when he is mistaken for a terrorist on board the flight in what is an early gag about such fears and perceptions established in the opening. The persistent rejection of a Visa so as to travel abroad and resume said dream lasts several years, and takes us up to more recent times - a stretch of time that holds up the party and forces him to work for his original Pakistani network whom sends him out to cover more menial jobs including such things as "Cock Operas" (don't ask). Hassan's enthusiasm to get started within the domain of journalism syncs up nicely with that of what we can only imagine were Sharma's initial struggles and problems in attempting to get his film made; the meeting of a certain chicken farmer named Noora (Singh) at one of these media events coming to formulate the catalyst Hassan needs to try and unlock a pathway into the big-time of media scoops and 'proper' news journalism.Principally, Noora's uncanny resemblance to a certain Osama Bin Ladan leads Hassan and his small crew that he concocts to shoot a mock-Al-Qaeda video of the guy making grave threats and release it so as to garner some kind of fame. For the most part, their idea works; for the best part, it falls apart – Sharma's film going on to cover that of the fallout from such an instance, an instance that we entrust the Taliban would probably deny the happening of in real-life, but an instance that brings about the presence of an American General whom is dropped in to work with the Pakistani secret service after Hassan's tape leaked from there. The General is named Ted (John), someone with very little time for pleasantries, but when it comes to formulating a plan to spend the nation's defence budget on blind warfare, he's all ears. The man sports a romping Kentucky accent and comes at us as an odd variation on Brian Cox's character from the first X-Men sequel. He launches a fresh bombardment on the nation of Afghanistan, a country with very little to do with the problem that arises within the film anyway, in what arrives as a quaint allegory for America's own real-life involvement and engagement with the nation of Iraq born out of the 9/11 attacks.In spite of all the publicity, I've little doubt Sharma has set out with good and proper intentions in regards to making the film; he peppers his lead's apartment with very specific American film posters, that of 1976's Rocky and 1998's American History X, two films encapsulating the lead's attitude and general framework. In sync with Rocky, the man chases a dream; an ambitious youngster in a certain field gunning for some kind of rags-to-riches tale that'll see him come out the other end richer and on top, whereas Tony Kaye's devastating American History X is, at its core, a film about a man realising the falsities of his thinking and coming to regret the getting of those close to him involved in the politics he attempted to implement himself into. When we are most aware of these two posters, it is when Hassan is outlining his plans to his collective troupé of beauticians and camera operators, thus syncing up with the above thoughts. The film is, away from all prejudices, a neat and effective enough comedy piece, opting for drama towards the end, managing to pull off mostly all of what it sets out to cover, in what is an honest, somewhat scathing and rather smart satire on the post-9/11 world in which we live as well as the idiocies that such an existence brings out in people who are otherwise dedicated; motivated and somewhat intuitive." 
" Kungfu Chicken :P","Well i haven't finished watching it yet, only half way through but its quite good. I don't watch many bollywood movies to be true as i m tired of all the same stories being repeated and good Hollywood stories being ruined and you know the end of a bollywood movie from the start but this one is different and quite simple and yet humorous enough to keep u laughing.Although it disappoints in a few things like i was quite intrigued when i read earlier before the movie came out that a whole big research was done on a typical Pakistan neighborhood and people, streets and people's outfits were being imported and such but i must say the movie does a very poor or no job at portraying a typical Pakistani street specially when you see the lots with caps and whatever they carry on their soldiers and such, i don't know but i haven't seen anyone with such things here apart from the "Masjid imams" and even that very rarely and that truly takes away the Paki look thing from it as i have only seen such people in bollywood movies (typical Indian Muslim represented in a bollywood movie) before and i don't know but you don't see normal people in those outfits here and such but yeah other than that, the punjabi-urdu accent and the overall setting brings it quite closer to a typical Paki setting and does a good job at telling a few of the different parts of Pakistani society like a simple village guy with a chicken farm, a radio guy (apparently this guy was done perfectly for a typical Paki radio guy with both looks and sound), an ambitious girl and then a typical educated but ambitious guy who dreams of a better life in America and is rejected many times but keeps trying and so on and not to forget the kicking chicken, i laughed like hell there.But anyways lets go and finish it and i encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to go and get it and watch it for if nothing else i am sure you are gonna be laughing a lot :)oh and about another review relating the moderate stuff, chill out dude, I m a normal paki and trust me Ali Zafar isn't even 10% as "moderate" (if that's what you like calling it) in the movie (although i don't know what you are talking about since he is simply just doing a normal role of a typical Paki and does it quite well) as i am or i know many Pakistanis to be, we have different sections of society and most of them are much more advanced than your beliefs and thats what makes us different and unique so chill out and enjoy and smile at what you can :)" 
" A surprise for the lot....","I saw this recently thinking lets c what we guys make comical of bin laden.so i dint expect much....but it was a surprise....this is a low budget movie....but this was funny....the guy who was Noor did play his role as bin laden really well.... i recommend u all should give this movie a try....i thought it was worth watching.the acting was good....it was funny....all in all i thought it was well done....go ahead....the way the story unfolds is good.you mostly know what is going to happen next and all.but still the situational comedy is good....and the part where you see the wannabe cop is hilarious. i say again i was totally surprised by it.but was happy to see at end of this movie."
