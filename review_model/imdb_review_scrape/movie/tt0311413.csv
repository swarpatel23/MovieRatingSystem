" Watchable","Krodh is the story of a hot and short tempered man who takes care of his 5 sisters whom he loves more than his life,and the people and situations he has to face because of his nature,and with the people who have wronged him and try to harm him. It is a family entertainer-melodramatic,with good dialogues,some fist fight. But the film is unnecessarily long,and all the song sequences are unnecessary.They only prolong the movie.Some bit of overacting by the heroines. Sunil does a great job,so do Khader Khan and Johnny Lever However the film lacks the same punch as the original made in Malayalam by name "Hitler"" 
" OK film","Karan has got five sisters whom he looks after his parents have died. He can't see any guy in front of his sisters and won't tolerate if any guy tries to talk to his sisters.Two of his sisters fall in love with two guys from the locality which does't go too well in his eyes. He protest and even beats one of them. This creates some disturbance in the family. Karan's temper holds it against him most of the time.Some drama, action later all of them gets united.There are some nice moments between the brothers and sisters. Rambha is a showpiece in the movie." 
" One of Shetty's better acts","KRODH is a remake of Hitler and the story is done to deathThe handling is pretty good at places thoughThe film is typical commercial film with lots of loopholes too like how can Suneil suddenly get a bungalow and also some trite comic scenes from Johny Lever and the painful shrieking of the sisters and acting by the villains plus by Apoorva AgnihotriA few dramatic portions are handled well though and also the bond between Sisters and Suneil and also the Kader Khan scenes The ending is too clich√©d and also the pace keeps dropping in between and also the film gets too lengthy plus the forced romance angle between Rambha and SuneilDirection by Ashok Honda is okay in parts, better then ANTH and RAKSHAK Music is okaySuneil acts well and carries the film on his shoulders, he shows maturity in his role but the angry look in too many scenes is a put off though it's a demand of the role Rambha is good only in the penultimate scene when she gives a lecture to the sisters otherwise she is nothing great Apoorva is awful and so are the sisters Johny is the same how he is always Rami Reddy is wooden while his brother is bad Mohan Joshi is as usual Kader Khan is good"
