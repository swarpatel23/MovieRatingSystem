" better director would have done wonders for it but decent attempt.","I watched this film and thought some may say the film's subject has been repeated before felt it was a decent attempt from Govinda considering he made it on a low budget with no really big stars or big publicity.Personally i do not see why many critics and people complain about the subject being old. Look at films like Hum Saath Saath Hain, Dil to Pagal Hai, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Haven't the subjects they been based on been repeated before? So why complain about Sukh when even directors like Yash Chopra, Karan Johar have picked themes that have been before? Beats me.Anyway, what could have help this film is a better director. Govinda's brother Kirti Kumar (actual name Kirti Ahuja) directed this film and he has not been able to capture the magic he had in Hatya. Hatya remains his best film and this film doesn't change that. Unfortunately he fails as the director to infuse some life in the script.Govinda does a good job. At least he has tried something different and to be fair he does do a good job. There is a certain honesty and sincerity about his performance especially towards the end. The only thing i say is he should get himself into shape. A fitter Govinda is much better even if the films are not doing well.Preeti Jaganani is o.k, she looked comfortable opposite Govinda despite the age difference. They do share good chemistry and i hope they star together in better films and with Govinda trimmed down. Chunky Pandey isn't that bad but the chemistry and spark between him and Govinda is not as great as it was in Aankhen. Aarti from my view wasn't great but not bad either, i didn't really have any complaints of her character or performance.The film shows how sometimes the simplest of men can become greedy for money in today's world and how trust and love is important for a successful marriage.I don't think the film isn't really a film for teenagers or young adults. It is more aimed at the elderly and couples in their 30s and mid to late 20s from my view but i might be wrong.The film is worth a watch for Govinda and the message it is portraying. A decent attempt by Govinda but direction would have made it even better.My Rating- 6/10"
