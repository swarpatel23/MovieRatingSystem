" Mixed with fun, quirkiness, drama and sincerity","Made on a rather decent budget, 'Mixed Doubles' gives us a glimpse of an ordinary married couple Malti and Sunil. Though some people do not seem to understand that ups and downs are part of a normal marriage, they just complicate matters by 'spicing' things up as is the case with Sunil. What I liked about 'Mixed Doubles' was the honest attempt with which the story is told. Rajat Kapoor's direction is solid and the narration is smooth. It isn't trying to be anything extra-ordinary. It tells a simple story about a common married couple with an uncommon twist. The relationships are shown wonderfully with a sense of humour like the way Malti seduces Sunil or Sunil's father-in-law cussing at him. The characters are very real and easy to relate to. Sagar Desai's exceptional score flows beautifully with the film. Konkona Sen Sharma, Ranvir Shorey and Naseeruddin Shah all deliver authentic performances. Koel Puri is refreshing to watch and Rajat Kapoor brilliantly downplays his part. Some of my favorite scenes are: when Konkona chases Ranvir with a knife (an act to get him to bed), when Koel busts the balloon and the child pulls a tantrum, when Nasseeruddin is cussing at Ranvir, when Konkona breaks down and the last argument scene before the couple have tea.'Mixed Double' is made with an honest attempt and it works as a great entertainer while raising a question or two about society and ego (but nothing too heavy)." 
" Enjoyable watch!","I think the movie was really well made. Apart from its theme which has mostly been the topic of discussion, I think its the general treatment of the movie which is commendable. The strengths of the movie are its pace, dialogues, humor and some realistic, natural acting by both Konkana Sen & Ranvir Shorey. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie and recommend it for some easy, fun viewing.The movie can be best appreciated by the urban crowd of India. The storyline avoides being overtly sentimental or judgemental about any moral position rather treats the subject in a reasonably light-hearted humorous manner. This assures that you enjoy the movie. Viewer interest is further maintained by good dialogues and acting." 
" A great refreshing independent movie about your next door modern urban Indian guy.","I went into this movie expecting S*&# and came out thanking my desperation for making me me watch this movie.It really made a what would have been just another afternoon at home a great day at the movies.The characters are people everyone in the age 25 to 40 can identify with. Everyone of those are someone you can identify in your office or within your own friends.What i was most impressed with was the language with was exactly like how we as urban Indian from Bombay talk. The only good and bad thing depending on the way you look at it is the lack of abusive or supposedly cheap language that all guys who sit together in the office would use.The movie is great fun and although you kind off know what is going to happen in the end you still enjoy the ride.Some of the scenes are hilarious and the acting is top notch.The scenes where the characters are nervous actually made me nervous when i even thought of putting myself in their shoes ( i am not married though any girl interested).Also particularly good was the end which left you thinking about what must have happened and I'm sure everyone will have a opinion as to what really happened.A great movie and a must watch for everyone who is urban Indian especially." 
" Refreshing and funny romantic comedy about swinging .. from India","A couple in their thirties with a school-going son have everything materially. Jobs, a car, a nice apartment. But in the bedroom, things are not as they were at the beginning of their marriage. From a friend coming over from the USA, the husband hears about "swinging" or wife-swapping. He hopes this may solve their relational problems. He buys a magazine with classifieds and tries to persuade his wife...Pretty funny and fresh romantic comedy and morality tale (or "a-morality tale" as is proclaimed before the end titles.).This is definitely one of the most modern stories from India that I have seen. Refreshing and funny and with likable actors.Recommended if you think that you can identify with a married couple in their thirties. 8/10Although the IMDb Status says "Filming" while posting this review, the film looked very finished when I saw this at the 2006 International Film Festival of Rotterdam." 
" A superb story about a happy couple put in a very awkward situation due to the lack of excitement from their partners.","Beautifully directed! It's a story about a normal middle class happy couple. A man after 10 years of marriage wanting something different 'sexually' but he doesn't know what. That what leads him to being fascinated with his friend's story about 'wife swapping' & he thinks this is what is missing in their mundane normal married life.Some people fail to understand the constitution of marriage, where ups & downs are very normal sexually or otherwise & they try to complicate the situation in order to add the excitement. Some times it works & other times It definitely leaves a mark & provokes your thoughts It's a must watch. Very natural acting & superb direction" 
" Sensational topic but very watchable with fine acting","This film may deal with the supposedly sensational topic of 'partner-swapping' but is surprisingly watchable. The relationship between Konkana Sen Sharma and Ranvir Shorey feels real. Both do a good job. There is plenty of humor but the film is at heart a gentle romance as well as a cautionary tale. Apart from a few foul words, there is very little that is objectionable in the film. Vinay Pathak and Naseeruddin Shah have nice comic roles while directer Rajat Kapoor chips in with an understated yet decent performance. While admittedly not for everyone, the film is definitely worth watching.Overall 7/10" 
" An Entertaining Comedy with Superb Performances!","'Mixed Doubles' is realistic, but extremely funny & entertaining, as well. Its an under-rated film, that hasn't lapped up the way it should have with film buffs.'Mixed Doubles' Synopsis: To spice up his life, a husband asks his wife to swap him for another male, while he swaps her for the other male's wife.'Mixed Doubles' tells an absurd love-story of a couple, with a lot of humor, which quite frankly, works the most for this venture. The Screenplay is innovative & engaging. However, the final 20-minutes, are disappointing. The climax, in particular, looks artificial. Rajat Kapoor's Direction is simple, yet perfect. Cinematography & Editing are average.Performance-Wise: Ranvir Shorey & Konkona Sen Sharma lead the film with sterling performances. Both of the actors, are in top-form! Koel Purie is excellent. Rajat Kapoor, himself, delivers a natural performance. Saurabh Shukla is decent. But the actor who steals the show, is, Vinay Pathak. In a brief role, the highly-talented actor pitches in a splendid performance. Naseeruddin Shah looks tired in a cameo.On the whole, 'Mixed Doubles' is quite a fun ride." 
" Bold theme presented very simply","Its an average neighbourhood family and deals with issues that most people have but never acknowledge. Whats good is that its not so predictable and tells one how to move on in the journey of life. Everyday and each person in our lives is how we want to make it, but then who takes care of my wishes ? So even if you detour from the usual to try your life in the wrong lane, its not easy unless you are used to driving on the wrong side of life. There is a reason why life is the way it is...and just trying unusual things wont spice it up.. Also exposes how in a relationship, one person accommodates the other..which one are you in your life...watch and find out !"
