" Refreshing sweet movie","This movie I initially watched without interest on a TV channel. But gradually the sweetness of the movie hooked me. What seemed like nonsense seemed to have merit.This movie is different. It doesn't have the typical Bollywood melodrama. It's more like a amateur movie or TV serial but with much more sweetness. The characters are refreshing. They don't behave like they are out of the world. The hero is so like th guy u encounter everyday at college. His acting is very natural.Why the movie didn't click is lack of melodrama and stars. The movie is about two strangers who take part in a game show. They have to spend some time with each other(at girls place, at boys place, at hotel and then alone) and at the end part(not meeting for another 20 years). Earning 10 crore each.The boy has to pay 75 lakhs. The girl requires money to keep her house of dog shelter. Siddhant, the hero is always happy go lucky guy. He cracks jokes but is very good at heart. He is not successful and wants to make his dad feel proud. The girl is also engaged to marry to a successful guy. The guy is very understanding and allows his would be for this competition. For rest..see the movie." 
" Sometimes Funny Sometimes Sad, Thats HumDum","This is the story of siddant and rhutu , the two young characters of this film, who are chosen to play a game show where they will be together for a month or so (playing 4 rounds)and then at the end of the game will be asked whether they prefer the money (RS 10 Crores) or love, if they choose Money they cant see each other for the next 20 years.this romantic comedy, even though it bombed at the box office, is surprising well made, the acting is convincing, so is their plight and anguish. the premise which if properly exploited might have generated interest in the audience was not at all well utilized, the promos of this film sucked, so much so that very few people actually went to watch this film. but those who did enjoyed it and thats why here I am writing a comment on it! So see this movie if you like comedies without too many strings attached, good acting from some new comers and a really cute heroine!"
