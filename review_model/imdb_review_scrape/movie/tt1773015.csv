" A must watch movie with some superb acting and tremendous direction.","After a long long time, I was overjoyed after watching some movie. Wonderfully written script and at the top of that marvelous execution on the screen. A commendable screen play it was in the movie. With the theme of recession and its side effects on different classes of society, movie progresses. First few scenes give you a gut feeling that its not a routine come and go movie and after some 20 minutes, movie changes its gear. After interval you find yourself so engrossed in the movie that you starts guessing What's next... and end of the movie gifts you a great satisfaction and admiration on your lips for this master piece by Subhash Kapoor. There is nobody in the cast, who did not do justice with their role. Rajat Kapoor played his trademark NRI role mercurially. It was an effortless, flawless, natural act from Rajat. Sanjay Mishra alias Bhai Sahab is also brilliant as always. Sarcasm in his super seriously delivered jokes forces you to an inevitable smile. Oye Lucky Lucky Oye famed Bangali, Manu Rishi has also displayed perfect timing with his role. His strong desire to go to US, his English classes and watching US based news with his glittering eyes and supportive dialogs in various frames ensured that his character is strongly written like every other character of the movie. Amol Gupte as NetaJi and Neha Dhupia as Munni gangster are also very promising. The best part of the movie is, you never loose your smile. At the same time, you guess about the next action from either Rajat Kapoor or Manu Rishi or some Gangster. The light, humorous and a little sarcastic way of presenting some of the very sensitive truths of our society is really commendable. I am overwhelmed by watching this movie and hope, it would be liked and appreciated more than those clungy, crampy, non-sense movies, which are over flowing in the bollywood these days." 
" After the Recession...","A gangster relieving himself...camera moves up...zipper closed in time...Phew! Points a gun at a blindfolded groom but fires his own hand...Bad Luck. Kidnapping business not going good for "Bhai"Sahab(Sanjay Mishra, convincing) and gang(Manu Rishi, Amit Sial and 2 others). Reason...People cant pay up ransom due to Recession!Entry of NRI Om Shastri(Rajat Kapoor, controlled & in top-form) who has received a Bank notice to clear his $100,000 debt within a month. He returns to India from New Jersey to sell his ancestral property & gets kidnapped. This is where the Movie begins...Unfortunately, this is the only place where PGRO falls short...the initial pace, clearly a fault of the screenplay rather than direction. The initial scenes were certainly needed to provide for character development but a crisper editing before the interval could have elevated the movie to an altogether different level. It takes around the interval to climb the slope but certainly gives the promised thrill, thereafter. My only fear during the movie was that such an original story should not have a sudden or an over the top or an ending leaving you in bad taste. Thankfully, it did not!On the acting front, Rajat Kapoor was spot on. The supporting casting was very well done too; Manu Rishi as the small-time gangster(Ani) inspiring his gang with Obama-speeches & Sanjay Mishra as a broke gangster with a dream to become a politician. Neha Dhupia as a man-hating Sculptor-Gangster (Munni with no Zandu balm!) tried to look her part but was overshadowed in her comparatively smaller role. Sadly, Amol "Bhope-Bhau" Gupte (Kaminey) got a smaller screen space, too but did his best. The slightly lower budget cinematography as well lack of songs (except one in the credits) enhanced the narration process. The humour in the writing bounced about from crude(interpretation of "Yes, we can") to good(Receipts for kidnapping ransom, English coaching scene) but didn't distract the storyline.PGRO is a good example of what a good original script can do in the hands of a capable director(both by Subhash Kapoor) without an A-list star cast and Music/Dance sequences and high budget props.Me and my friend were planning for Rakta Charitra 2 but landed for this as there were no shows for the former. I was greatly apprehensive of taking the risk of watching a movie I knew nothing about, on first-day-first-show (especially after the outrageously disastrous Raavan...shudder!).I know this one wont be bothered by the Luv-SOrryyy & Ud-Ud-Bangg crowd. It's not a deep thought provoking or ROFL-hilarious drama either. But for once, I'm glad I took the chance.Sense & Simplicity7/10" 
" Don't miss it. It's one of those rare Hindi films that's funny and smart at the same time!","This deliciously smart comedy from writer-director Subhash Kapoor stars Rajat Kapoor as Om Shastri, a desperate NRI from America, who must sell off his ancestral village property so he can save his home in New Jersey from being repossessed by the bank. Within days of arriving in the village, however, he is kidnapped by local crime-pin Bhaisaab (played by the excellent Sanjay Mishra), who dreams of a fat ransom in exchange for the NRI's release. When Shastri reveals that he's lost everything in the recent financial meltdown, Bhaisaab's dreams are crushed. That is until Shastri himself, along with Bhaisaab's trusted right-hand man Anni (played by Oye Lucky Lucky Oye's Manu Rishi), comes up with a shrewd new plan that will make both the kidnapper and the victim richer by several lakhs.Constructed from a terrific script that's strong on plot and packed with crackling dialogue, 'Phas Gaye Re Obama' is consistently engaging. Shastri plots his own 'sale' from one wisened gangster to the next unsuspecting crook, in what becomes a chain of hilarious cons. Along the way we're introduced to a string of quirky, original characters that add colour to this palette.Neha Dhupia stars as Munni, a dreaded don who despises men, and who's dubbed herself the female Gabbar Singh. She surrounds herself by an army of tough-looking henchwomen with names like Kareena, Deepika, Madhuri, Rani and Preity, and spends her free time chipping away at male statues. Amole Gupte plays a permanently constipated minister who runs a professionally managed kidnapping-and-extortion company, where you're provided with a receipt on payment of the ransom, and a one-year guarantee against a repeat abduction.But the star of the film is Manu Rishi, who brings just the perfect degree of naïvete to his role of a gangster's moderately-educated sidekick yearning for a better life. His character, Anni has his heart set on moving to America, and insists he's got what it takes – he's watched reruns of Obama's famous 'Yes we can!' speech repeatedly, he's taking English lessons at a local coaching class, and he hasn't missed a single one of Sylvester Stallone's greatest action hits.'Phas Gaye Re Obama' is unpredictable and surprisingly relevant, even if the film's title (which seems to squarely blame the US President for the recent global recession) is a bit of a stretch. Cleverly written and sharply cast, it's a film that delivers hearty laughs. Don't miss it. It's one of those rare Hindi films that's funny and smart at the same time!" 
" Yes, bollywood can!!!","Another gem of 2010.A comedy movie with a script (which is very rare now-a-days).Plot Summary: NRI OM Shastri is broke after recession hits USA, going to loose his home very soon if he doesn't come up with enough money to save it. He visits India to sell of his old "haveli" but finds all his relatives now stay there. He is now in a dilemma how he could make the deal, in between local goons com to know that an NRI has returned to India and kidnaps him. The movie starts here.Directing: The movie is directed in a very smart way, no unnecessary scenes, no songs (oh, that's a breather) and a nice crisp and fresh presentation.Editing: The editor did a superb job here. I can not point out a single scene which is stretched unnecessarily or slows down the pace of the movie. For a movie like this pace is very important which keeps the audience engaged and keeps them guessing whats gonna be next.Acting: I liked acting of Mannu Rishi in "Oye Lucky..." and he shines again here. Rajat Kapoor, I would say, had not had much acting scope. He did what the script wanted him to do...i.e.go with the flow. But, I would admit Neha Dhupia's effort, she is becoming an unavoidable choice for such small budget movies. And her acting skills are mentionable now. AND, SANJAY MISHRA as BHAISAAB is nothing but superb...each scene he is on screen is a LOL moment. Kudos to him. Amol Gupte also did a good job too. So, it seems I've praised all who acted in the movie...hmmm...Cinematography: Not much scope to show u scenic beauty of the place but the camera shows u what u need to see. No unnecessary closeup, no try to invent a new camera angle...the camera work goes with movie tone...telling a simple story in a simple way and keeping the focus on story.Verdict: A very good black comedy. Expect an intelligent story with a predictable ending (only if u r movie buff and I mean it when I say "movie buff"). Don't expect a laugh-out-loud movie like Khichdi (none can surpass it, ever) but, ya if u want to include brain and still want to make people laugh, u can only go this far as did "Phas gaye re obama". A must watch for sure." 
" Don't miss it!","Outstanding! The fact that the critics haven't given this an even higher rating just proves to me that the critics have mush for brains. Watching a string of substandard Hindi movies does that, I guess. For too long, we have had formula movies parroting the same old junk. The current wave of realism in Hindi cinema brings to mind the "middle path" in Malayalam cinema, 1980s cinema which struck a happy balance between realism and entertainment.All performances are outstanding. The thing is, it could all really happen......the BIMARU belt comes to mind.....and that is the sad part of it all, and yet the fact that a filmmaker could find a way to mock those who live like this in modern day India is heartening!After all, someone must proclaim that the emperor has no clothes!" 
" A loud slap to all the glossy film makers teaching them the lesson that film-making only depends on writing, writing and writing alone.","One line review of the movie – Simply add the name Subhash Kapoor to the group of new extremely talented directors who are capable of teaching new lessons of cinema to all the big names relying entirely on Big Stars and their glossy film- making styles to save their reputed names in the Industry. PHAS GAYE RE OBAMA is a loud and tight slap to all those starry directors and it clearly reminds them the first lesson of cinema which says that Film-making solely depends on writing, writing and writing alone.A worth watching experience, not to be missed, PGRO is a big relief after the dull period of watching all those mediocre films coming from the big production houses. In short, this is one of those few movies released this year whose script should be used in all the film making institutes operating in the country to teach the art of script writing and even editing. Not dependent upon any saleable star or hit item song, PGRO is a delightful film to watch which is very intelligently neither made as a complete comedy (like Golmaal series), nor it has been especially designed as a deliberate satire (like Peepli Live).Brilliantly and thoughtfully written around the subject of WORLD RECESSION, it's a film which smartly touches many important issues prevalent in our country dealing with crime and politicians. Revolving around the plot of a visiting NRI in a remote area, it mainly deals with his kidnapping being planned by all the DONS operating in the region. How he manages to make fool of each one of them and successfully flies back to America with more money on his side then expected, is what the story is all about. Amusingly written around this thought of an NRI dealing with all the criminals, the writer showcases several major drawbacks of our society in a comical manner. Starting with the scene of groom-kidnapping, it talks about the still existing charm of going to America for earning dollars, the kind of English being taught in the remote areas by self proclaimed teachers, the influence of OBAMA and his slogan "Yes We Can" on the whole world, the kidnapping racket run with the aid of gangsters and politicians and the power of media to change the course of things in just a few hours.In the next few days you are sure going to hear praises for the movie from all your friends and critiques. But regarding that I would like to state that don't take PGRO as an out and out comedy in any case. The movie is not anything like GOLMAAL series but is more like a OYE LUCKY LUCKY OYE kind of project where you will enjoy each & every development on the screen with a big smile on your face along with few laughs at regular intervals. Here the director neither uses any silly comic sequence to make you laugh nor does he uses extensive abusive language in his dialogues to make some deliberate ripples in the theater (as done in Peepli Live). But still he manages to impress you hugely with his skillful writing and perfect characterization of his few characters in the script and literally excels in that.Based on a purely novel thought incorporating the subject of RECESSION in the world of GANGSTERS and UNDERWORLD, it is indeed a first in the world of cinema. The lead hero of PGRO is its well written script which both starts and ends on equally shining notes and leaves a long lasting impact on the viewer. In fact this is a kind of movie which will largely satisfy the cinematic urge of ever true movie lover and student of cinema world-wide. For instance, just carefully look at the costumes, dialogues, gestures and expressions on the face of every actor on the screen, which clearly explains the contribution made by its director in adapting the taut script for the celluloid in such a splendid way.Performance wise there are several small gems scattered throughout the film, delivered by some familiar names. With no one interfering or overlapping each other in the acting department it is a rare balanced show put up by all the actors. Rajat Kapoor as the NRI is as usual fine in his calm and cool approach. Sanjay Mishra as the disheartened gangster is excellent. Manu Rishi as the "Security" in each deal is simply wonderful. And Amol Gupte in the second half as the corrupt criminal minister is outstanding. He should really do more such films for the sake of good cinema and its hungry viewers. In the female lead, I really loved the look and feel of Lady Gabbar Singh played by Neha Dhupia magnificently. In fact I found her looking more sexy and beautiful in the get up of a lady gangster (with eyes filled with surma) than her usual glamorous looks we normally get to see. With class acts delivered by the entire star cast, PGRO, a songless film, unarguably is one of the surprise packages of the year which once again proves that Hindi Films does not only mean love, song, dance and big stars without any so called script.In nutshell, it's a highly recommended flick which at last provides us the much needed break from all the silly romantic projects seen in the last few months. So, do yourself a favour by watching PHAS GAYE RE OBAMA at the earliest and encourage directors like Subhash Kapoor to keep on giving us more such projects in the near future. And thanks to Warner Brothers for supporting such a non-starry product, which solely depends on its merit of exceptional writing." 
" Not DE DANA DAN...","PHAS GAYE RE OBAMA(2010)
comedy
Cast-Rajat Kapoor,sanjay mishra,Manu Rishi chadha,Neha Dhupia.
A NRI man gets bankrupt on the period of recession and comes to India to sell his house to pay his loans back.The film starts when he is kidnapped assuming him to be a millionaire.
Jolly LLB series director Subhash kapoor has written a classic script involving the recession period.It is very difficult to make a comedy film in India which manages to keep both script and humour simultaneously convincing and only a few films are able to do and this film is among those few flicks.
Rajat Kapoor is excellent as the intelligent NRI businessman.Sanjay Mishra is brilliant in his role.Manu Rishi Chadha steals the show with his effortless role of a man living with the dream of living in USA.The rest of cast has also done a good job.The English coaching class scene is iconic and one of the best comic scenes in Bollywood, the film not just make us laugh but it also depicts the reality of our society.
The power of the film is the story, an equally competent screenplay.
There is difference between pure comedy films like Dhamaal,De Dana dan,Golmaal franchise and Witty ones like PK,Peepli Live.The movie proudly sits on the latter category. 
The film is unpredictable and will keep u guessing till the end.AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE." 
" Almost Perfect","Phas Gaye re Obama (PGRO) based at the time of the global economic recession, is the story of Om Shastri (Rajat Kapoor) who, once a successful business-man in the USA, is now broke and faced with the prospect of finding himself and his family without a home to live in. Left with no other choice he decides to visit India to sell his ancestral mansion and honor his financial obligations in the US. While the horrified attention of the world was fixated on badly faltering giant corporations, the little heard-of Kidnapping Industry in Om Shastri's village was going through times as rough as any other. Not only did the hostage's family reduce the ransom negotiation into a ridiculous Palika-Bazaar bargain they even asked back the kidnappers for loans. But as Om Shastri sets foot in his village kidnappers' sentiments soar as if Barack Obama himself had sanctioned a billion-dollar bail-out for this ailing industry. Through a series of hilarious plots Om Shastri touches the lives of several kidnapping gangs climaxing at the big-daddy of this Industry.Even though the plot of PGRO is virginal the concept has similarities to films like Khosla Ka Ghosla, 99, Sankat City, Ek Chalees Ki Last Local etc. in terms of the main protagonists getting unintentionally involved in the matters of the mafia, illegal money and through their ingenuous wits coming out unscathed and even richer on the other side.As is common to such films, PGRO also relies on well-crafted characters with ridiculous peculiarities and ironic scenes such as Mantriji (Amol Gupte) sacrificing a goat during the inauguration of a bridge while holding the portfolio of Ministry of Animal Welfare. The humor is restrained and at times subtle as opposed to cocky, laugh-out-loud wisecracks.Special mention for the background score that cleverly puts a variety of music ranging from 60's style Nirupa Roy-ish sitar twangs to Chak De India style exhorting crescendos to the most unexpected of scenes and characters.A slightly faster screenplay could have raised the prospects of PGRO's box-office success but if you are used to subtle humor then you will not complain.Quite liked the movie - 7 on 10." 
" Diamond in the ring!","Nothing about this movie should attract you if you are a selector when it comes to watching a Bollywood movie, but Subhash Kapoor has made a mighty big impression with this incredible story if you have or happen to be watching the ending credits. If there is something called as sensible humor, then this movie draws upon a real world theme and blends it with a tactfully written plot which only gets increasingly entertaining and curious before the perfect finish.The movie draws the audience with true to happen, yet hard to believe state of affairs in village gangs and Anni is a character that sticks like glue right away. While the pristine performances of all not so popular actors are brilliant, the true hero here is the script. Backed by authentic, crackling, and situational dialog's, the movie paces comfortably and makes every scene enjoyable. And if that is not impressive, a few scenes like the YES WE CAN chant and the English class turn this into truly memorable movie watching. Rajat Kapoor is very himself in the role while Neha Dhupia and Amol Gupte are very good. The page turner and the star of the show is Manu Rishi (Anni) and his brilliant performance. His portrayal of aspiration, honesty and comic timing will make you watch this movie again. Sanjay Mishra is over the top again with the character of Bhaisaab.Not plaguing this story with item numbers, unneeded songs or illogical twists makes this a "Diamond" in the golden Bollywood ring!" 
" Funny gangster caper","The setting is 2008, when the entire world is reeling under the financial tsunami of the Wall street collapse. And the tremors of those events are being felt as far as rural India, where a group of bumbling "khandaani" kidnappers are ruing the "recession" that has made their plight pitiful – victims are offering ridiculously low ransom payments, no one is paying protection money and things are so bad that they cant afford even outgoing calls on mobiles.Amidst this gloominess, the semi-literate member of the group Anee announces the arrival of NRI Mr Shastri to their town and the kidnappers immediately see a pot of gold with him. Unfortunately for them, other "senior" kidnappers in the area are also seeing stacks of dollars in front of them. In the midst of all this, imagine if Mr NRI is himself bankrupt and is in India only to sell off his ancestral property. Phas Gaye Re Obama's story flows well, and a few sequences are especially memorable. Especially the organised kidnapping business, with its bank-like ransom handling facilities and a "kidnapping receipt" - which is to be shown in case of any other kidnapping attempt and is valid for 12 months :) !! There is no sag anywhere in its runtime and the laughs are generated by its quirky characters and their rustic nature (it carries the tradition from the previous gangster capers Sankat City and 99 - both of which I adore). The "khandaani" kidnapper, Bhaisaab, played by Sanjay Mishra, is a delight to watch. And giving him company is Oye Lucky Lucky Oye's Manu Rishi – the America-worshipping, small-towner Anee – who gets his dreamer yet gullible act pitch perfect. Rajat Kapoor plays the hassled NRI effortlessly – he seems made for these kind of roles only. Neha Dhupia was the only misfit – her character too unrealistic and her performance nothing to write home about. Amol Gupte carries from where he left off in Kaminey, a natural gang leader. The movie holds your attention well for its entire runtime and the ending is not quite what you expected – so full marks to the director for that as well. There are no songs etc to distract. A solid effort by debutante director Subhash Kapoor, but left an aftertaste very similar to Sankat City etc. If it was not preceded by the above mentioned movies, I would have rated it a little higher. And others, who haven't watched those movies will definitely have a lot of fun watching Phas Gaye Re Obama" 
" Genuine laughs, wit and great performances","Satires in their relatively rare existence have proved to be difficult to work upon in our film industry. For every 'Jaane bhi do yaaron', we also have a 'Peepli'. Director Subhash Kapoor sets his talented cast in the aftermath of the global recession with an outrageous mockery of the President's Yes We Can slogan. From its harshness about recession in America to the hilarious slump time for the local underworld, Phas Gaye Re Obama works in all aspects. The once millionaire, now in-debt Om Shastri (Rajat Kapoor) is on the verge of bankruptcy with his home on the brink of foreclosure in a month's time. Unless he finds means to pay off the bank, the recession threatens to bring his family on the street. In a desperate attempt to salvage a family fortune, Om travels to his homeland only to find that the recession has hit the hinterland as well and it will be impossible to sell the ancestral Haveli. However, the news of a millionaire NRI reaches the ears of Bhai Saab (Sanjay Mishra), a dejected yet ambitious small time gangster who kidnaps Shastri in broad daylight. Now, not only does Shastri have to salvage his home, but he also has to escape from the clutches of the tiered underworld of rural India involving Bhai Saab, Ali Bhai, Munni and an aspiring minister who secretly runs a very well organized kidnapping business. While the film gradually gathers pace in the first half after introducing its characters, the audience is entertained through hilarious scenes and dialogues that suggest nothing loud and ridiculous but are wacky and genuinely funny. The second half of the film is where the director shows his adroitness in dealing with suspense, drama and comedy in a satire while making it all sensible. As the screenplay draws your attention through a narrower tunnel, the focal point becomes Shastri's ingenious suggestion of his 'idea' to the goons, leading you to rejoice, applaud or grab another handful of popcorn till the next part unravels. Phas gaye re Obama is witty and without being nonsensical, it tries well to elaborate the plight of an opportunist in adverse circumstances that often tend to be seriously funny. The film's strengths lie in the director's ability to engage the actors into their characters leading to their laudable performances, the crisp screenplay that leaves no room for fillers, the witty dialogues however silly and a smooth blend of comedy stirred into serious circumstances. Often times, the film looks very serious but the characters have been introduced so well, that one cannot control the smirk even in a serious scene. While its comedy may not be a constant throughout, the lack of excessive has led to this film being worthy of a watch. Rajat Kapoor is a versatile actor and here, he leads his co-actors while showcasing a fine understanding of Om Shastri's circumstances. Sanjay Mishra was always capable of being more than a sidekick to someone and here, he proves that he is dependable in all comic avatars. Manu Rishi plays the pro-American Anni who works for the gangsters but deep within, is a friend-in-deed of Om Shastri. Neha Dhupia, in a shorter role, does better than her attempts at anything else in her glamorous career and Amole Gupte as the sly politician is convincingly brilliant. The sequence with 'Tyagi English Coaching classs' is sure the bring the house down while many dialogues and scenes involving Sanjay Mishra, Amole Gupte and Manu Rishi hold the comic bits together. Phas Gaye Re Obama is new age non-formulaic cinema that is funny unlike the attempted comedy of errors that we are subjected to so often. This is an effective satire with the recession's repercussions experienced by likable characters who are enriched by the director's adept writing and screenplay. If you enjoyed 'Tere Bin Laden', then you have no reason not to embrace this tribute to Obama.8.110 on a scale of 1-10." 
" Average Fare...","Subhash Kapoor's 'Phas Gaye Re Obama' is a golden opportunity, gone wrong due to monotonous writing. Subhash Kapoor excels as a director, but as a writer, he disappoints.When any filmmaker attempts to make a film on a satire, he/she must raise the questions efficiently, and more efficiently should be ready with the answers. But, Over-here, almost everything comes across as half-baked. 'Phas Gaye Re Obama' is an outstanding idea, which begins with a bang, but becomes a bore after a point. The Screenplay repeats itself, and there is no novelty after a point.Subhash Kapoor should've worked on the writing. If the writing was sharper, this film had all that it takes to become a gem, but what finally comes out, disappoints. Cinematography is alright. Performance-Wise: Manu Rishi is effective. Rajat Kapoor is stiff, while Neha Dhupia scores in a supporting role. Sanjay Mishra is good. Amole Gupte gets limited scope.On the whole, it's an opportunity missed! One expected much more!" 
" A stupid movie which will make you cringe out of your seat.","It starts with a positive and impactful note. A realistic and light- hearted take on actual condition of gangsters and effect of recession on them. After 30 mins, it starts going downhill. Every side character except the 4 gangsters (Anni, Bhai Sahab and 2 fellow gangsters) looks forced, out of context, absurd and meaningless. By the time Neha Dhupia comes on the screen, you would want to switch it off. And once she starts delivering her dialogues, you would want to break the screen. Her character (Munni Madam) is the most cringe-worthy ever. Totally makes this movie another stupid piece of mainstream comedy with no originality. The ending is as unfunny as the later half of the movie, with a wannabe 'happy ending, everyone so happy yay' vibe. Go ahead if you want to get deceived by the ratings. By the end, you would have wasted your two hours on a stupid movie which you would forget in lesser time." 
" Away from the bollywood shore","This movie is for all the movie lovers who feed on foreign language movies(not Hollywood/bollywood) for the fresh and refreshing plot and characters.Its a story about recession and how it affects the kidnapping business and the local goons. It has a short movie kind of treatment - a problem - an opportunity - and a fresh solution.The characters are memorable - partially because of the uniqueness and partially as they have been played by talented actors. Rajat Kapoor as usual fits in his role, Sanjay Misra is amazing in this movie too funny and he knows how to make a simple line hilarious. Neha Dhupia always does good to a strong character like she did in 'Ek challis ki last local'. Manu Rishi is memorable as Anni,(don't miss the English coaching class scene).One thing more that makes this movie funny is the background score/music. When a gangster is telling about the difficulties he is facing in kidnapping, when a son meets his father,etc. The music is perfectly placed. Few times bollywood make some sensible movies, and we should appreciate these." 
" Very Nice... beautifully executed","Once again a short budget movie came with a surprise like 'Udaan, 'Tere Bin Laden' , etc. Brilliantly written and directed by Subash Kapoor. Fanatastic cast , each and every one was appropriate for the role. No forced comedy, , Fantastic characterization and very good Climax. Rajat Kapoor, Manu Joshi, Amol Gupte, Sanjay Mishra and Neha Dhupia all delivered effortlessly. Its absurdity is what struck me the most... some really out-n-out whacky moments there...and Am glad Sanjay Mishra finally got a lead role of sorts...... Even the cast with 1-2 scenes were very good especially English Class teacher . loved some of the dialogues ... recession ke time pe aati to wud have had much more impact......Watch it and you wont bedisappointed for sure ;)" 
" light weekend watch @ home","Picked up the VCD from the store and it was lying around for 2 weeks. Decided to watch it today and enjoyed it. Love the way they have cracked satires on recession and the kidnapping racket in India. Rajat Kappor of "Mahesh Uncle" fame gives a measured performance but the most likable character for me is "Anni" in the film. Remember the actor who played Abhay deol's friend in Oye lucky lucky oye.The movie had its quota of comical moments and gave me some good laughter. The narrative slacks a bit but the plethora of hilarious characters and moments saves the day. Only if they could have found a way get around neha dhupia."
