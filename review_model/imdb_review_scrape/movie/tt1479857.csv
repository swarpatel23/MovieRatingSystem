" Mithunda is just superb....","Before we get into the film, here's a special mention to: Mithunda, this film has him, and the biggest plus point is already packaged. The Multiple-National-Award-Winner never disappoints, and 'Zor Laga Ke Haiya' is no exception.Now coming to the film. Surprise, Surprise, Surprise... 'Zor Laga Ke Haiya' is beautiful film. Debutant Director Girish Girija Joshi makes a film with a noble intentions, and the message is really effective. "Save Our Tress" says the film, and after watching the honest attempt you actually support the issue. The film is directed well, the Cinematography is perfect, and the Music is decent.Talking of performances: It's a Mithunda show all the way. Mahesh Manjrekar is funny; making you laugh at the right places. Gulshan Grover is superb.... and he sure Loves Nature. The kids do a decent job, especially the one who plays Seema Biswas's son. Riya Sen, Seema Biswas, Raj Zutshi are passable in cameos. On the whole 'Zor Laga Ke Haiya' is a sincere attempt that deserves a watch. Go For It!"
