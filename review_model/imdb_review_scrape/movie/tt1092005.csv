" Best Comedy of the year","I just don't know that why everyone hates this movie so much because it's a million times better than the recent rubbish comedies that lacked a single decent joke and had no story like Singh is Kinng & Dostana. Golmaal Returns surpassed the original and was so painfully funny that I had a sore stomach. The story of the film is about Gopal (Ajay Devgan), who lives with his wife Ekta (Kareena Kapoor), sister Esha (Amrita Arora) and a dumb brother-in-law Lucky (Tusshar Kapoor), gets stuck in a yacht one night after he saves an attractive young woman Meera (Celina Jaitley) from the dreaded goons, while on his way back home from office. Due to the circumstances, both of them stay back on the yacht. When he arrives home the next day, his over suspicious wife Ekta, a hard core saas-bahu serial's fan, suspects him of flirting around with his female employees. Gopal thinks that it's difficult to convince her by telling her about the incident that actually took place the prior night and hence, he invents a story about spending the night with a fictitious friend named Anthony Gonsalves. Ekta does not believe his story as she knows that he never had a friend by that name, and hence, she decides to write to Anthony to come and visit her. Gopal then convinces one of his juniors, Laxman (Shreyas Talpade) who is Meera's boyfriend, to pretend like Anthony, and thus convince Ekta that he was indeed telling the truth. Laxman agrees to do so, and everything goes according to plan until the address on which Ekta had written a letter to Anthony turns out to be real. Meanwhile, Gopal finds out that a dead body was found at the same location where he saved Meera from the goons. The Investigating Officer Madhav (Arshad Warsi), who also happens to be Esha's boyfriend, does not get along well with Gopal. He finds out that Gopal was missing from his home that very night and that the dead person was Gopal's colleague and Gopal had threatened to kill him over a spat. Madhav also finds out that Lakshman is not the real Anthony. He asks Gopal to get Meera to the police station to prove that Gopal had been with her, not murdering his employee. In panic, his friends hire a woman called Munni who needs money to get her boyfriend Vasuli (A character from the previous Golmaal) out of jail. But Munni is kidnapped by the murderer. In a rage, Vasuli comes to Gopal's house, where Gopal, Lakshman and Lucky learn the woman was none other than Meera. After an initial shock, they decide to go to the police station. However, Vasuli kidnaps Meera in anger, and they follow him, along Madhav, Esha and Ekta. Gopal learns that this was a plot concocted by his employer to frame him for the murder. Through a series of comic events, Ekta gets back with Gopal and they have their happy ending.The music is also really good and the best song is Tha Karke and it is probably the most expensive song in the history of Bollywood with a budget of 10 crore. Overall Golmaal Returns is simply the comedy of the year and is one of the only films that made me laugh after a long time probably after The Simpsons Movie." 
" Leave your brain at home and have a blast.","Leave your brain at home and have a blast. This is what we call an entertainment. Just go and watch this film with your friends and have a great time together. This is what escapist fare means for ordinary people.Trust your instinct and enjoy this ride. Golmaal returns with its sequel Golmaal Returns. From its promos, it turned out to be movie which I was looking forward to watch. In fact gags shown on promos were all so good that I wondered if they had left any gag for us to watch in movie or not! Since movie is sequel of 2006 Golmaal which was a laughing riot, so this movie i.e. its sequel had to lot of expectation prior to watch. It is advertised at better than Golmaal, so obviously I was expecting more and it did turn our pretty nice.The star cast of the movie now includes more name like Kareena Kapoor, Amrita Arora, Celilna Jetley and now famous comedy guy Shreyas Talpade. So how much this movie succeeded on expectations. Well, talking about the performance of movie, movie is great to watch and you will enjoy it throughout but hilarious ride is not consistent and this is the biggest let down of the movie. Most probably, bad script is what we can call the culprit.But did i say to leave your brains at home?The movie has enough twists to make it fun to watch, Ajay Devegan as Gopal has a wife Ekta (Kareena Kapoor)who finds everything suspicious. Incidentally one day while trying to save a woman named Meera (Played by Celina Jetely) from some violent stuff he ended up spending a whole night on a yacht along with Meera. Now next day when he get back to his home, he has to answer his wife Ekta but he can't tell the truth as her wife will take it otherwise. So he ended up making a fake story that he spent a night with his old time (fake) friend Anthony. She is not convinced and she ask him to call his friend to visit home. To make up the things, Gopal convinces one of his work place guy to play Anthony but meanwhile Ekta is able to contact a real person on the fake address Gopal told her for Anthony. To make things worst, it is found that the at place where Gopal spent night police had recovered a dead body." 
" Modernised version of "Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar" and not good enough.","Rohit Shetty, chooses to remake an old bollywood comedy in the form of his "Golmaal Returns". The story is heavily based on an under-rated, 1973 released, Bollywood comedy called "Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar" featuring Kiran Kumar, Radha Saluja, I. S. Johar & Asrani. In fact Asrani also got a Filmfare Award for his performance as "Champak Bhumiya".The plot revolves around a suspicious wife (Kareena) and her husband (Ajay Devgan). To explain, why he was out of the house a whole night, Ajay makes up a story and then it goes on & on creating new difficulties for him. Actually Ajay was stuck while saving Celina Jaitely from some bad elements and had to spend a night in a friend's place with her. However in the original movie, the real happening was more innovative, where the hero gets stuck on a giant wheel (in an amusement park) whole night with a young girl, due to power failure.So the idea of first main scene, borrowed, was not adapted well. Feeling a low, I still had expectations from the movie as it was progressing, but coudn't find much to laugh and enjoy since the plot was not new for me. Rohit, the director, could not create the same old magic, which was there in his first part. The film goes on & on with no strong storyline up and makes un-impactful attempts to make you laugh.The two people who give some scenes to enjoy are Tushar & Shreyas. Tushar still shows the magic in his funny language and Shreyas displays his great talent for comedies again. Ajay Devgan was OK in his part with no support from Arshad Warsi. In simple words, Arshad is wasted in an underwritten role and has got nothing to show. Kareena plays the role of a suspicious wife in a good way, but the role was not meant for her and it looks like she was added to the cast only for more commercial values. Celina Jailtely, Amrita Arora & Anjana Sukhani, all are simply there to fill up the screen space with nothing really written for them in the script.Instead of an original "Champak Bhumiya" (in Aaj Ki Taaza Khabar), this time we have "Anthony Gonsalves" as the imaginary character who turns out to be existing live. The name and the act done by the comedian is a great let down if compared to the original source. Whereas in the first part "Golmaal", there are rarely scenes that make you bore, here in this sequel you find it tough to find the scenes you can enjoy with a great laughter. So it is not a well made sequel, quality wise. Though it has a more glossier star-cast this time. As usual, songs are just thrown away in unwanted places just to give you break for your snacks. And moreover no particular song registers itself in your mind.The climax is the most annoying part and is quite similar to like you have earlier seen in many "Priyadarshan" comedies. Where the entire star cast comes together on the screen and tries to generate laughter indulging themselves in some funny sequences. But here it fails to create a similar impact. So in all, the movie fails to keep the promise its name suggested, "Golmaal Returns".However, like the current trend, if the film-makers are only interested to get a good initial in the first 3-4 days and don't care about what happens to the film later on, then "Golmaal Returns" may give them back their money. But quality cinema is no where in the frame here." 
" Not worth a watch","I had expected a lot from this movie seeing the casting and previous record of Golmaal. But have to admit this is not up to the mark. Kareena, Tushar does a lot of over acting. A lot of Daily Soap stuff which I did not like. Predictable story line. A bit of Adult Humour.Dressing style of Tushar is not to the mark. Moreover this is the First Spoof Movie of Bollywood with some spoofing of Tashan, Black, Sawariya a bit action copied from Hollywood Movie "Wanted". A slow story but not too much slow. Keeps u occupied till end. A complete time pass movie. Would suggest u all to go and watch it in morning show just to save few bucks..No twists like we saw in first part..Ending is quite predictable with complete Bollywood stuff of happy ending." 
" Stupidly funny","This movie is so stupid that it's funny.I was expecting this movie to be like golmaal-fun unlimited but what I got was all comedy shows wrapped into one.I had a blast with this movie.The jokes are classic.The story lacks some stuff but with the funny chaos going in the movie you have to love it.The music is average with tha kar ke and the title song being the favorite.Performances of Ajay,Shreyas,Tusshar and Arshad are superb.Although Arshad doesn't get a lot of scope.Kareena is the best of the girls.Celina and Amrita are strictly okay.The rest of the cast is good. In conclusion leave your brain at home and have a blast.Golmaal Returns does return and is bigger and better." 
" Case of a Beautiful Building on a Bad Foundation!!","Pros:1.Great performances by Shreyas and Tushar. Tushar brings a smile on your face with his antics. 2.Crisp dialogues are a highlight of this film. 3.Ajay Devgan essays his role very well. 4.On the whole, very funny film. Cons:1.A very weak script spoils the film. 2.Film is dragged in the second half. 3.Some characters are unnecessary. 4.Arshad Warsi is wasted. 5.Music is one dimensional. Verdict: Overall, it is an entertaining film to say the least. However, some poor editing and bad script writing are blemishes on the film. To cut a long story short, GR is NOT a worthy sequel to Golmaal-1. You can watch it, if pure humour and baseless entertainment is your cup of tea." 
" Brainless but very entertaining","The rating is so high just because they made me laugh  a lot ! Its asinine for most parts, there are a lot of PJ's thrown in, the plot has more holes than my socks and it drags a bit towards the end. Yet it manages to entertain, crack enough good ones, poke enough fun at the producers, Saawariya or Balaji films to keep us in a state of mild amusement throughout with several sharp upwards spikes in the middle. Thankfully, they chose to abandon the earlier storyline and most of the characters  keeping just a few (I thought the first Golmaal was terrible) so you can peacefully watch it without being at a loss. Ajay Devgan is married to Kareena, named Ekta in the film just to allow some merciless leg pulling of Ekta Kapoor and her inane serials. They live with their siblings, Kareena's brother Tusshar (who's mute) and Ajay's sister, Amrita Arora. Kareena always suspects Ajay of having affairs and so one night when he doesn't return as he was rescuing damsel in distress, he prefers to lie rather than risk the truth. That lie leads to a lot of complications, some of which involve, Arshad Warsi as the cop who doesn't like Ajay but is in love with his sister, the snake-tattooed guy, a Rani Mukherjee from Saawariya clone, a dead body, men in drag etc etc. Some of the best moments come when they're ripping off something  there's a hilarious sequence when they're going hell for leather behind the Kingfisher tune (ooh lala le oleo), another where Ajay spouts dialogue mentioning every one of his films, again when Kareena uses all the Hindi serial names or when they use music from 'Tashan' and towards the end when they start beating Tusshar just because he's from Balaji Productions (in real life). Ajay was very good in this one, Arshad seems to have re-discovered his spontaneity (had been a bit flat in some of his earlier ones), Tusshar was good though I think they over did the mute jokes while Shreyas was wasted in his role  it was too slapstick for his talents. Amongst the women Kareena looked hot (though do you also feel that she's lost too much weight ?), while Celina, thankfully in this one, keeps her clothes on. I'll leave you with a couple of PJ's that are used  they're both questions really. What would Lara Dutta be called if she married Brian Lara ? Whats the difference between a secretary and a personal secretary ? If the answers (the first one is obvious) can make you smile, then you have a hope of enjoying the film. Else save yourself the effort or the expense. More reviews at ApurvBollywood at blogspot" 
" Is this a comedy or a spoof?","Oh man!!!!!!Seems like the sequels are going overboard with the success of PHIR HERA PHERI, KRISSH, DHOOM 2 But this film thankfully didn't become a big hit The film is nothing but actually a typical senseless brainless comedy Actually nowadays it's become a formula for a hit comedy: It should have 4 actors It should have some heroines who get some scope here and there it should have senseless running around jokes It should have jokes on other actors and films oh damn This film has all this in excess The film is a copy of AAJ KI TAAZA KHABBAR(1973), A film i came to know only when i read about it on the newspapers and reviews after this film released The film is just boring sadly, none of the jokes made me laugh mostly there are some funny ones like Ajay changing channels of the TV and then some more But mostly the film has c grade type of jokes already done to death What with, Tusshar and Shreyas doing a tom and jerry type cartoon comedy in their first scene together The story is non existent, comedy is unbearable and not even funny mostly Many scenes are just unwanted and the much hyped THA KAR KE comes across as stupid and forcedhe climax is one of the worst climaxes of all time, actually takes the film to the death completelyRohit Shetty should get off his comedies and try something better Music is okay, luckily only 1 song in the screenplayPerformances Ajay Devgan doesn't overact, and does well in some scenes but his role is hardly that great, for him Shreyas Talpade is quite funny at places, especially in the scene where he acts like a girlTusshar repeats his GOLMAAL act with even more weird noises Arshad Warsi seems to have just seen a DVD of a Marathi comedy film, or some south comedy and overacts and hams so badly it hurts Vrajesh Hirjee is boring Kareena is unbearable, she doesn't impress Amrita Arora and Anjana are as good as not there Murli Sharma just repeats his earlier act Sanjay Mishra is typecast, while Celina Jaitley has her moments" 
" Bollywoo's first spoof film..","Golmaal Returns is not an ordinary film but to be most precise a vagrant, bid scale, lavish Spoof-fest..It is spoof of all typicalities of bollywood cinema..It spoofs action, it spoofs romance, it spoofs even comedy and doesn't even spare Rajnikant too..Its not a film but a compilation of about a 1000 jokes rolled into a 2 hour 20 min show..You can say that its an extended Great Indian Laughter Challenge with each actor trying to outsmart the other..Its strange that even though it has no story, no script, a screenplay which I could write in my sleep, its pretty "SHAQING" enjoyable..You laugh at all though jokes but would still be wondering why cause they are so funny..Its an absolute time pass with a galore of single meaning dialogues(yeah not double meaning)..Its a guilty pleasure I would say..The jokes are all funny barring the atrocious climax where I wished to be doing what each character of the film was trying to do..Acting wise Tushhar Kapoor was dumb and he was good, so naturally he has been wasting his talent mouthing dialogues till date..Shreyas Talpade is good ..Strange that an actor Of Ajay Devgan's calibre accepted such a role where he is neither funny nor effective..Kareena Kapoor hams but then who in this so called film doesn't..Rest all are wasted(specially Arshad Warsi).Music is bad and songs are worse.." 
" Great stunts","Simple, great stunts, mindless slapstick comedy. Some jokes don't land. A leave your brain at the door film. Good for a one time watch with family stretched out in front of the television on a Sunday afternoon." 
" Nice comedy for time pass. Not bad","It's good for time pass. It's not a great comedy film but not bad. It's funny in at times. Some scenes are really funny. Though I agree it's not the best of film" 
" MY ALL TIME FAVORITE DIWALI BLASTING MOVIE","This movie is my all time favorite what e movie yaar totally brainless comedy love this movie"

" Leave your brains aside.... And it still is just okay","I don't know how people have given this movie a 9 or a ten, even if it very funny. A 9 or a 10 should only be given to a movie that deserves it. Golmaal Returns wants to be rated between three and five. The director himself admits that he doesn't believe that it would get any awards.Golmaal was fun, yet I would've given it a six because my rating limit or the limit that I have imposed in my mind regarding the ratings wouldn't change. I cannot suddenly give movies like Pyaasi Aatma 6 or 7 because it absolutely doesn't deserve or want such ratings. The sequel manages to get some laughter, but most of it it corny.The are a string of characters with a plethora of stories inserted as if the director worked in the absence of a script. The story was worse that Z-grade ones. At least the first one had a solid plot (solid in the sense visible, not strong).This one has plots within plot, making a complete stew out of it.Well, I'll have to admit that this is a welcome change from the Yash Raj films and the Great Indian comedy show, that latter which refuses to be funny due to the presence of Siddhu who laughs like a hyena. Tusshar Kapoor manages to raise the bar efficiently. But when the movie started with his scene at the parlor, he sounded annoying. But he managed to pull it off afterward. Ajay Devgan tries to be funny but isn't due to his rushed comic timing. The Ekta tattoo scene could've been funnier if he didn't reveal it is such a quick way.Shreyas Talpade was really funny and his acting is the saving grace because he doesn't sound irritating. And the fourth actor.... oh yeah Arshad Warsi. He was completely wasted.The actresses looked sexy in the first song. I wish most of their roles would've ended after that. Kareena was funny in the confusion scenes for a while but then just got too annoying. Amrita Arora, oh the new girl?... oh sorry, that Amrita Arora who has come in many B-grade movies. This is what I feel about her acting. It looked as if it was a debut film and she didn't know how to act at all. Celina Jaitley was better than the other three girls. She was not that funny, but her acting wasn't that bad. THe fourth girl? Was there one? I don't remember. Oh, that girl whom Tusshar Kapoor has his eyes on? I thought she was an extra!There are innumerable gay jokes. I don't know whether the director is gay, but if this film went to the U.S, this would be called 'Gay Bollywood movie'.The Saawariya jokes were really good. I can't imagine what Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ekta Kapoor must be feeling right now, especially the latter, whose one brother got involved in making fun of her.I'm going to go with a 4 for this movie, as I had told before. Hoping for a better sequel." 
" 850 grams of boredom, 50 grams of humour, 100 grams of songs = 1 kg Golmaal Returns","Exactly, thats what it is. I was expecting a lot from this movie because the promos looked kind of funny. This movie is nothing but stupidness combined with bad direction, bad acting and a good songs.Seriously, Kareena Kapoor ruined her repertoire, why did she agree to do this role? - Tushar Kapoor was really funny in Golmaal : Fun Unlimited, thats because he didn't make THAT much noise in the first one. In this movie he irritates you with his noise. - Ajay Devgan is a good actor, but here he was bad bad bad, he should't do movies just because Rohit shetty is his friend. - Arshad Warsi was the man of the screen, he and the songs managed to get four stars out of me from this movie. He is hilarious! As usual. - Celina Jaitley looks beautiful but seriously has no scope. 5/6 minutes maybe? - Shreyas Talpade deserves better roles, not roles like he had in this movie and Aggar. This movie is only worth watching for the very few funny moments (maybe 5 minutes of laughter in the whole three hours?) and the songs, the last 1 minute of the movie by Tusshar Kapoor cracked me up! Best 1 minute out of the movie!I hope they don't make Golmaal 3! And if they do, please let Priyadarshan be the director!Stay Away and catch the last 1 minute and the song clips somewhere on Youtube!" 
" Golmaal really returned","Golmaal Returns is back again with full of entertainment and enjoyment. I had to clear at first that Golmaal was not in my comedy hit list since I didn't really like it although it was positively received. To me it was a damn senseless and boring story, also performances were not deeply committed by the actors.But this second version of Golmaal is quiet hilarious and hope it can be one of the best comedies of 2008. The most noticeable case with director Rohit is that he mostly repeats his favourite cast in his every movie. That includes – Ajay Devgan, Arshad Warsi, Mukesh Tiwari, Sanjay Mishra etc. This time he made a bit masala of suspense and action than Golmaal but comedy is still his favourite subject. The screenplay and dialogues are really impressive, which ignite to concentrate on the story. The new additions to this series are Shreyas Talpade, Anju Shuklani and Amrita Arora who were not in Golmaal. But Shreyas strongly proved that he is not less than Sharman who was originally casted as Laxman Prasad in the first version. This difference of casting was also handled differently by the director in t he story where Gopal (Ajay) meets Laxman (Shreyas) and asks his name, when after learning he replied there was also another Laxman Prasad who passed away. He takes out the picture of Sharman and shows to Shreyas.Arshad Warsi as inspector Madhav also performed superbly better than Golmaal, where as Tusshar is the best in his role as a deaf but true romantic barber. And as Gopal done by Ajay Devgan, I had to say this is one of his best comedian parts he has offered in his career. He improved a lot after his previous comedies like Pyar To Hona Hi Tha, Ishq, Sunday, Hum Kisise Kum Nahin or Golmaal.There is no doubt that Golmaal Returns is a clean and fresh movie without any dark side. This made the movie to be successful with majority of audiences."
