" All seen before, childish take on friendship, love and relationships.","Ideally a smaller project with no big names should have such a solid content with some surprising novelty that it forces the viewers to take a strong notice of it as the word of mouth spreads post its limited release. In fact that's the only way of making it big for independent films, particularly for the debutant producers, directors and actors apart from the other tried and tested formula of having a hit soundtrack, which is another hard to find feature in the present times. Hence its always exciting to watch all the lesser known, small budget films looking for that exclusive, innovative content breaking the routine pattern. But sadly, a big disappointment is what they have to offer most of the times with all seen before stuff, strangely tried without any major names in the cast pointing towards the immature outlook of the entire team behind their making.Incidentally, the present MAIN AUR MR. RIIGHT is also one of those poor films made on the ages old concept of a boyfriend/fiancé/husband hired by a successful lady for her own reasons for a specific period of time. And here we have Shenaz hiring a wannabe struggler actor (a Salman Khan fan again) as her Mr. Right for a few weeks in order to answer her group of friends asking her to marry or get engaged at the earliest. Now either the debutant director really had something else in his mind or on paper that couldn't get transformed on the screen as per his own visualization or he and his writers are perhaps still stuck in the same old formula of "a hiring turning into an eternal romance" used umpteen times before in our Hindi Cinema.As a result, what we get to see is a completely immature and uninteresting film in those two hours, that can easily be called a quite childish (or rather funny) take on love, romance and changing relationships between few long time friends. It begins on a comic note with all fresh faces showing some promise, but then quickly falls flat once its clichéd plot gets revealed turning it into a completely predictable and boring fare post the initial 20 minutes. Though the film is more about Shenaz looking stunning in her well chosen costumes right till the end, but the girl is nowhere close to the fairly enjoyable act of Barun Sobti playing the hired Mr. Right with a typical Punjabi feel and some good comic timing. So where Shenaz fails to impress due to her badly written character, Barun tries his best to deliver the only good moments in the film along with the other actors who probably are just their due to their personal contacts with the makers or straight taken from their ongoing short term courses in a known acting school.With a tacky editing, average cinematography and a filler background score MAIN AUR MR. RIGHT has only one above average feature in its favour and that's a well composed and sung track "Bhool Na Jaana Mujhe" in an unplugged style from Astitva Band. The soundtrack also has a version of famous song "Yaar Bina Chain Kahan Re"(SAAHEB) from the man Bappi Lahiri himself and few other noticeable songs such as"Khuda Khair" and "Desi Daru" trying hard to contribute something into this avoidable venture.In short, this is another example teaching an important lesson to the budding producers, directors and actors, that unless a low budget, smaller venture has something fresh or novel to offer, it can be nothing more than a ignorable, wasted effort or may be a producer's own means to show some losses in a financial year." 
" Never have I ever watched such a stupid film","Such a dumb cinema...now wondering why I even watched it! Just because of sobti??
Other than him it was such weird assemble of cast." 
" Waste of time and space","Haven't seen a more dumber and artificial movie in my time on this planet so far...avoid at all costs" 
" Mr. perfect","Mr. perfect-I really liked the movie. Barun is not shy to be in the picture funny, even ugly... Here is he-real pros - a lovely comical, dramatic and romantic the actor, all genres him on shoulders." 
" Just sharing with you all my experience","A must watch movie for the young generations and the acting of two main lead actors is also superb.The script is also awesome could have been a little bit different but still its a Blockbuster. The movie is far more better than Happy New Year and other silly movies. Go watch it Guys n Barun Sobti's acting is also far better than our superstars.The movie is totally a love story.It also depicts how lives of your friends change after you tell them a lie.The busy relationships.Drama and suspense. life of a struggler.A kiss too. A dumb girl as always .It Contains Everything to be a blockbuster. Rating that guy 10 out of 10. Cheers Harman"
