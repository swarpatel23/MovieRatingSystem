" Lose script, fails to keep attention..WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!!","Story line is very lose and unpractical. While watching the money movie you would think of other things rather than focusing on the movie. Apart from Ranvir shorey , and Manu Rishi everyone failed to do justice to the strong characters they were given.As all the actors have tremendous job in past, so seems that the director failed to get it out from them. No background music points at all.Seems like a movie which followed the path of Delhi Belly but completely failed and is not even closer to it.In short, NO COMEDY, NO MUSIC, NO ACTION, NO HUMOUR.Be ready to watch another movie after watching this to lighten your mood." 
" Nothing worth except Manu Rishi.","When few relatively smaller films taste success at the box office due to their exceptional content then this makes way for an immediate chain reaction in an expected way. At one end it gives the much required encouragement to the film-makers who are just waiting for the Big Day with their novel ideas and concepts. But on the other end it also results in many mediocre directionless projects which are just there to encash the changing trends and nothing else.Regrettably LIFE KI TOH LAG GAYI belongs to the later kind of movies, with an all repeated stuff and a lazy script revolving around the Mumbai underworld, two broken relationships and the conmen operating in the film industry cheating the ambitious youngsters. The film walks on the same used before format of few different characters and their stories amalgamating with each other moving towards a common end point. Though the intentions seem to be honest behind its realistic writing but the execution is not able to make any kind of desirable impact on the viewers. In fact just after few minutes into the film, one can easily guess what they are going to show in the next reels and how its all going to end at one place with a lot of blood-shed.Director Rakesh Mehta chooses a wrong subject for his first film which lacks novelty. With Indian viewers now open to all kind of new ideas and concepts, he should have taken a different script for his first gamble. A weak script cannot result in anything good even if you rope in some great actors such as Kay Kay Menon, Ranvir Shorey, Manu Rishi, Pradhuman Singh, & Neeraj Vora. In tiny roles the film also has Jackie Shroff, Shakti Kapoor, Tom Alter, Sharat Saxena, Asrani, Rukhsaar and Razzaq Khan. Neha Bhasin (singer) makes her acting debut and looks good on the screen. However she should have chosen a different film as her first venture since she has got the appeal as well as confidence.In the music section LKTLG, thankfully uses its mediocre songs only in the background in their shorter cuts. But with Manu Rishi playing a Haryanvi Jaat, the director should have used the track "Main Haryana Ka Sher" by Daler Mehndi more prominently both in the film and its promos. Honestly, LKTLG has only one merit in it and its Manu Rishi who plays the helpless cop pressurized by his seniors. And if only the film was written just around his character alone, it could have been a different story altogether since he is quite impressive in his amusing portrayal.In its present version LIFE KI TO LAG GAYI is an attempt which tries hard to be different relying on an uninteresting script. It is also a perfect example of those smaller films which are penalized by the Censor Boards for their abuses with a beep because they are not backed or supported by any Big Star. So you can watch it once for just Manu Rishi alone (whom you must have loved in "Oye Lucky Lucky Oye", "Phas Gaya Re Obama" & "Ekk Deewana Tha") and not for anything else." 
" A Tensed Humorous Story , Highly Entertaining ****","You can count on Mumbai the city where every man landing here, ends up saying, "Lag Gayi". Mumbai has it's own character and makes human lives fall into it's own daily story. Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi is one such journey of four people tasting a slice of the Mumbai story in a day's time.Salmaan (Kay Kay Menon) is a revenge seeking builder searching for his parents murderers. He divulges into past and present making his search interesting and indulging. His discovering of gun is a scene to watch out for. Amol Ganguly (Ranvir Shorey) easily slips into a Bengali babu caught in a honey trap, courtesy Deboshree making his life miserable. Enters Ajoy Ghosh (Pradhuman Singh) and adds a new dimension to all heart broken romantic idiots and makes Amol's life terrible. Amol and Ajoy turn your white blood cells into black with their effort-full suicidal tactics. Dolly Saluja (Neha Bhasin) is a financially broken runaway girl, lured by stardom. Her escapades make her look into the real life in Mumbai making for interesting viewing.Kay Kay Menon is in form and displays controlled aggression. You want more of him, but the screen time doesn't permit so. Ranvir Shorey does well for his Amol, the sequel will make him a dangerous character to vouch for. Pradhuman Singh's Ajoi is a maniac musical dilemma, straight out of Guns and Roses. He is a revelation and relaxation for the young generation with preaching hell ways. Manu Rishi is the surprise package of the lot. With a heavy Delhi lingo and care free attitude, he sleep walks into his character Chautala with tension tension and more tension. Mass is always class with Chautala. Whereas, Neha Bhasin does justice to her Punjabi character with ease.Rakesh Mehta, the writer director clearly has heavy influences and inclinations towards underworld subjects. Managing three more layered stories with the same background is quiet a feat. He has tried to maintain a fine balance and has surely come close to the right mix. His dialogues supports the director in him perfectly. Mumbai through his lens is nostalgic.Catch the film for Salmaan's subtleness, Chautala's aggression, Ajoy- Amol's unbalanced chemistry and Dolly's edgy life. Discover Mumbai again before you say 'Lag Gayi'." 
" Unexpectedly hilarious and clever. Life ki Toh Lag gayi subverts all expectations","This movie was so well written and is unlike any bollywood movie I have ever seen!!! I have to say I am impressed. Writing and direction of Rakesh Mehata is balanced and combination of relationship with comedy and consistency is the soul of the movie.Logical approach of the director makes sense towards communicating the script. The film's direction kept the scenes and plot lines moving to keep you interested at a comfortable pace with great doses of Rakesh Mehta. I loved the cast.Four stories running simultaneously in the film without any gap or fault. K.K. Menon, Ranveer Shori, Manurishi Holds the Movies.Bangali will definitely keep you laughing . It's a fresh and a very much needed change from the silly better-forgotten so-called comedies that Bollywood has overloaded the audience with. The execution is first rate. It's very well-paced. The songs and background score contribute well to the mood and atmosphere and adds to the flow. The cinematography and light effects are super. It's great to see bollywood cinema back in a clever comedy after a long time and he does it very naturally. It was very well written and often fresh with well developed characters you enjoy to watch. It is definitely a must see movie of 2012."
