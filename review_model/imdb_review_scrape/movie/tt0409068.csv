" Two Hours Of My Life, Never Coming Back","Add Ridiculous Plot lines, Tremendously Bad Acting, and Vrajesh Hirji (Bad Acting isn't word enough), and you get the disaster of a film called "Muskaan". The story starts with a dashing young fashion designer (Aftab Shivdasani) being introduced, We then know that he is a moronic ***hole whose motto is "Slap your friends for people you don't know". He continues to do this till the very end. He has two girl - friends in Anjala Zhaveri and Neha, till his paths cross with muskaan (Gracy Singh) who's disowned by her parents and lives in a hostel (Suits her right too) and then Neha is Murdered. Who did It? Believe me, you don't need to know.The Movie is the epitome of bad acting, Perfectly good actors like Parveen Dabas, and Gulshan Grover are wasted by a mediocre script, and moronic dialogues, There are too many songs in the movie, none of which you'll want to listen to again (One of them goes "Tujhe Yaar Kahoon Ya Yaaram" :) Gracy Singh, which was decent in Lagaan, Falls flat in Muskaan. The only saving grace of the movie is Neha, who is a very bad actress, but extremely hot, check out the scene after she slaps muskaan (Yep, There Are Slaps Abound) 1/10, Watch Only If you're paid a large sum to do so."
