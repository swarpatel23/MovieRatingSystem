" What a Movie!!!","I have not watched the Malayalam original but I don't think I need to. If ever u need to to be proud of an Indian film in front of an American, this is what u'll need. A very intelligent mix of drama, suspense, thrill and comedy with traces of romance thrown in between.... Right from the start, the movie never sags. All the characters r well chosen & the storyline is taut. The plot is of a couple returning to the husband's native place and a haunting they encounter there. Although the plot has been explored before, the performances by actors here are commendable. The couple seems an actual couple, the father looks like a father, everything rings true and credible. Its hard to believe they r acting. The suspense unfolds gradually and is very ably switched with other elements but the interest is never let down. The crazy doctor looks like he can do nothing! But looks can be deceptive. A very well-chosen protagonist! Different, in fact from the conventional ones...Twists n turns at d right times and finally, a fitting climax....short enough to hold attention throughout. A masterpiece of effort! A bigger budget n a little better dialog delivery esp. from Akshay cud hv made d movie flawless...In the scene where Akshay explains his discovery, he seems to be struggling for words...just a bit, though!!! All in all a gr8 movie....Rating 9/10" 
" It's 2018 and STILL my favorite movie!!","BEST MOVIE EVER! Like, I was 5 years old when this movie released and now it's been 13 years...and still this movie is tightly stick with my heart. There is something which is ever green in this movie and I just....I just love Bool Bhulaiyaa and trust me, I know it's been a long time till now when this movie was released but if you want to watch FFUNNY and HORRIBLE Bollywood picture with your family or friends....just go for it!! Go for BHOOL BHULAIYAA!" 
" ***fantastic****","first off, i'm white - straight up Wonder Bread. my experience with Hindi films and bollywood started on march 17th, 2006 when i met my husband - he's Hindu (... well, duh, lol).up to now, my opinion of bollywood in general has been pretty much a couple of gems in a huge pile of... well, "not gems", particularly when dealing with the old films. not much by way of dancing technique, even (sorry, don't shoot me, just my white bread opinion) the vaunted hema malini, to me, does little more than jump around shaking her anatomy and flapping her arms about. a lot of the classic songs, i can't tell one from the next because they're all sung by lata mangeshkar. while she is a fantastic singer, i really wish songwriters would have taken the opportunity to showcase her voice instead of just having her do the same 6-note riff over and over. like i said, it's only imo.what a fantastically terrific exception is Bhool Bhulaiyaa! it's got all the best parts of the old Indian classic movies: lavish, luxurious sets and costumes; huge crowds that pop up out of nowhere for various odd and assorted reasons; extraneous music numbers (no particular reason why, but we'll both just jump on a bicycle that popped up out of nowhere and weave madly through the countryside singing); great dance numbers featuring crowds of ppl that were nowhere to be seen before and probably won't be seen in the rest of the film.special mention: the dance scene at the court of the evil king - i can't tell you how many times i've watched that just so i could wallow in the purity of line and the sheer crispness and clarity of expression. that duo is surely a world-class dancing pair because they are SO precise and they positively reek of expertise. the term "dancing gods" keeps coming to mind.on the other hand, while it has all the wonderful OTT-ness of a classic bollywood film of the 50s and 60s, the music has been updated - the lyrics are typically incomprehensible romantic weirdness ("i am yours, only yours, you weave through my breath" - i mean, hunh!?) but the music is modern and fresh. the characters are also a wonderful blend of high camp, high drama, and modern minimalism. i really enjoyed the scene that's reminiscent of a joke featuring a guy talking on his cell phone while a girl behind him keeps answering back thinking he's talking to her. oh - except in BB, the guy's not wearing anything and the girl is in the shower stall while he's outside.what i really like is that the movie doesn't actually EXPLAIN anything. oh, explanations are given on all sides but what's really fantastic is how it doesn't slight the old ways and put Modern Science up on a pedestal, nor does it reject the new ways in favour of ancient tradition. you make your own determination as to the truth - no matter which way you see it, it will be correct.thriller, psychological drama, romantic thriller, horror, comedy, comic tragedy, chick flick, action film - no matter what your buzz, you'll find it in Bhool Bhulaiyaa!" 
" Wonderful Bollywood suspense movie!",""Bhool Bhulaiyaa" is a movie that pleasantly surprised me. I wasn't aware of the fact that this is a remake. I live in the Netherlands and only can get copies of Hindi movies. So without having any knowledge about the story I could watch this movie with fresh eyes and just loved it. The trailer is very misleading and letting people believe that it is a comedy. And I was glad that it wasn't. It is a real good suspense movie. Not in the sense that it was thrilling every minute. But you just feel that something is up. The comedy and horror elements are there to put you off course. I love the fact that they play around with superstition,religion and science. It is quite a remarkable psychological thriller. Be honest. There aren't many Indian movies like this compared to Hollywood movies. Not one minute I got bored with this movie. And let me tell you that is saying something. I have seen a lot of (American,Korean,Japanese,British,Dutch and Hong Kong)movies this year and with most of them I was very disappointed. And now you have "Om Shanti Om, "Johny Gaddar" and "Bhool Bhulaiyaa that did quite the opposite. For me this movie rocked big time. And there should be much more movies like this one." 
" Priyadarshan's one decent film since HERA PHERI","It's not a superb film, But yet seems a decent remake of CHANDRAMUKHI and Manichithrathazhu (1993) Luckily some bad comic scenes of Chandramukhi were not retained The film isn't original as such, in fact the entire climax is a copy of the latter film while the rest is copied from Chandramukhi As usual, Priyadarshan always brings his south films here The first half is slowly and steadily well developed but things get boring soon, the hysterical scenes at times are stupid like the entire Paresh Rawal scene where he doesn't speak, the length is a problem Akshay's character comes 45 minutes late and then there is focus more on comedy and some scenes are funny, though the supernatural angle takes a backseat and resurfaces slowly The entire suspense angle does catch you unaware and is well handled but the climax is a copy of the latter inspired film and it some how looks too much Yet in all fairness, the film is better then DHOL, BHAGAM BHAG and emerges a decent film Priyadarshan handles the film well, though some scenes are repetitive and also some comic scenes fall flat yet he handles the genre very well Music(Pritam) is of hit variety, though Hare Ram comes at the wrong time Cinematography is decentPerformances Akshay Kumar despite emerging late is superb He not only excels in comedy, but also does a brilliant job in serious scenes, shocking his haters he is one of the best part of the film Vidya is ordinary till the suspense is revealed and then she does a good job, though Jyothika and Shobana were better then her in the originals, yet she does a good job Shiny Ahuja isn't in form, he hams and goes over the top so badly that he gets to your nerves Manoj Joshi is in form, thankfully he doesn't make loud sounds and runs around like he usually does in Priyan movies, He is excellent Paresh Rawal is funny in few scenes, overall the same thing what he does mostly Rajpal Yadav has 4-5 scenes and he does OK, he too is repetitive the rest are okay" 
" A good thriller","Despite the fact that the movie was promoted as a comedy, the film is a physcological thriller with a few comic situations. Priyadarshan does a good job as a director. In comparison with his previous films, he takes a leap as a director by making a movie with a genre of its own.In my opinion, Bhool Bhulaiyaa is way better than the original movie, Manichithrathazhu. Probably because of the technicians have improved since then.Akshay Kumar does his usual comic act, and he's funny here as well. Shiny Ahuja hams, but is good in parts. The last 45 minutes belong to none other than, Vidya Balan. Throughout the movie she doesn't have much to do but the steals the show with her superb performance towards the climax. Ameesha Patel looks ethereal and is effective in a small yet important role. The supporting cast are first-rate, especially Paresh Rawal, Rasika Joshi and Manoj Joshi.The songs are good; Labon Ko is easy on the ears.All in all, Bhool Bhulaiyaa is a well-executed movie, though lengthy in parts! Time-pass!" 
" Highly Recommended...!!!","Got a wasted day..?? This movie's gotta everything to make it all right. Well cooked story, nice and gripping presentation, power-packed performances.. and a humor different than the conventional slapstick humor that we get in movies these days (well, at least it was presented differently).Priyadarshan is really a come-back in this one. Though I liked this fella always, but his movies had been following a routine kinda trail and all his experiments like Bhagam Bhaag have been failing miserably. But this movie was really a welcome break from his side.Akshay Kumar, as he has already proved several time, has got a great comic timing. He brings twists to the movie's plot as well as inside your belly as you go laughing all the way. Vidhya Balan looks very sweet except for once, but I'll talk no further to ruin your suspense if you haven't seen the movie yet. Paresh Rawal & Rajpal Yadav are once again a treat to watch.Go see this movie. Its an ultimate stress buster. Go with the guys, and you will have even more fun. :-) I vote, "Highly Recommended"." 
" Superb movie !! though i feel incorrectly named","This was a movie tagged as a comedy, one which featured the likes of Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar plus directed by Priyadarshan. Naturally everyone expects this to be a comedy. Wrong !!! This is probably the best thriller of the year. A horror flick which has touches of comedy scattered around. Kinda reminds you of Johnny Depp's Sleepy Hollow.I won't go far as comparing Sleepy Hollow with Bhool Bhulaiyaa, because they are not comparable. One is a Hollywood flick and the other Bollywood. One which is high budgeted other relatively low. But you cant but feel that the comedy which seemed forced in Sleepy Hollow is same for this flick. It really appears forced. One can feel that they can do away with the comedy in the first half of the movie all together. The sequences where the bloke has to be dumb in order to complete a holy task, just appears too forced.And yet again, Akshay Kumar's comedy reels appear so natural. But like Priyadarshan's previous Bollywood movie Bhagam Bhag, this one also is a thriller. The difference is Bhagam Bhag remains a comedy, whereas Bhool Bhulaiyaa is indeed a thriller.Vidya Balan gives a stellar performance, (I won't say why cause then you have too see the movie, I wont be giving out any spoilers) and so does Akshay Kumar, despite his so late entry almost an hour into the movie. Shiny Ahuja also appears impressive, he always does. Manoj Joshi was also very good as the elder figure of the family. Rajpal Yadav is probably the only true deserving gag reel of the movie. His small role is quite pertinent and gives you the laughs just about when and how it's necessary. Paresh Rawal and Asrani are wasted in the movie. An actor of Paresh Rawal's capability shouldn't have been used in this role. Amisha Patel is also wasted. A tinsel beauty of her caliber deserves far more screen time, though still she gives a very nice performance. But end of the day this movie will definitely be remembered by Vidya Balan's performance which is nothing short of mind blowing.Keeping in the theme of the movie, very few songs have been used. Just three in fact apart from the title track which is shown during the end credits. And the music, background score is also to the point and perfect. The camera work is superb. One might feel towards the beginning that there are some bad editing, but towards the end you can feel that everything was actually kept intentionally and are all pertinent towards the climactic sequence of the movie. The sets were crafted lavishly and the entire locations are stupendous and exquisite.Last of all, the direction, well what can I say ?? Priyadarshan is definitely the best Indian comedy director in my book, but this being his first complete horror/thriller he receives kudos in my book.9/10 !!!" 
" Very Interesting","Bhool Bhulaiyaa is a suspense thriller with a humour. It is not as tense as the great 1996 movie "Kaun" directed by Ram Gopal Varma. However, it does have it's moments and all characters played their role very well.A newly married couple Siddharth (Shiney Ahuja) and Avni (Vidya Balan) came back from America to live in Siddharth's inherited Palace, which is known to be haunted. There is a room on the third floor which was kept locked and tied with a holy string to keep the evil spirits from coming out.The news of the marriage left Radha (Amisha Patel) with a broken heart as she was in love with siddharth.Both Siddharth and Avni are educated and do not believe in ghosts. One day Avni's curiosity got the better of her and with the permission from her husband she opened the door.Since then, series of calamities and accidents have occurred. The locals blame the Avni for their misfortune, however, Siddharth thinks it Radha who has concocted these accidents to make Avni look bad and eventually be a threat to Avni's life.Siddharth thinks Radha is mentally ill and asks his friend Dr Aditya Shrivastav (Akshay Kumar) to investigate and help Radha.You will have to see the film for the rest and I'll tell you, it is very interesting.Akshay Kumar was a very mediocre actor during his early movies and has slowly blossomed into a great actor. He's very good to watch whether it be in a comedy role or a more serious role. This brings out the best of both these roles from Akshay.7/10." 
" Among the best this year !!!!!","The Pedagogue of comedy has yet come again with a psychological thriller.One of the 2 main movies releasing in the week, this one is a clear winner.Set on the scenario of an NRI (Shiny)returning to India after some years along with Vidya Balan, they encounter some strange notions that villagers follow in their hometown. Shiny , determined to find the true reason of the extra normal activities, he calls in his friend , akshay kumar, who deals with such paranormal activities.To add to this mystic they are presented with a caution to enter in a particular room which has remained closed for ever so long and sole cause of the activities.Priyan has by far given true justice to the script , and perfected the art of 'Thriller film making'. It isn't the kind of comedy that you normally expect from Priyan, but the overall well presented, but the comedy scenes do see to be too verbose.This film is a true treat for the philanderers of the Akshay-Priyan-Paresh combo." 
" Masterpiece","One of the best comedy movies of Akshay Kumar.
Vidya Balanis outstanding. Akshay Kumar is phenomenal as always. Good music too." 
" A New Concept That Thrived in India","What can I say? This movie has made wonders. It has given the rise of other horror-comic films like "Stree" and "Go Goa Gone". However this movie itself never shows that it is boring even if you re-watch it. The ways the characters had executed their role were brilliant and the comedy balances out with the suspense.
This movie is not scary for me at all . (children might be frightened)" 
" Where there is such a talented director, there is a masterpiece.","It is not actually a comedy movie at all! It is a absolutely a different type of work gifted to us by the talented director.We all know that Priyadarshan is a master of comedy, he knows how to make people laugh anyhow.But if you are thinking this movie to be a comedy, you are mistaken.This is a good drama, thriller and 'get a clearer picture later' kind of a movie.I will not claim it to be a mystery since there is not anything confusing.All of the actors were just fantastic, but Akshay Kumar could do better.I would have appreciated more presence of the Rajpal Yadav.This movie surely deserves to be in your collection.Long Live PRIYADARSHAN !" 
" Hats off to Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar","1st of all hats off to Priyansahab for making such a movie even though it is not original script. Have I seen Kannada or Malayalam version of this movie? NO... then why should I suffer from original or remake issue? 2nd thing I appreciated most is cinematography and art direction thoroughly in every frame of the movie. 3rd thing gripping direction and very much interesting, suspense and thrilling story-line and script by Neeraj Vora. Hats off again.I just watched it in last show yesterday and in spite of absence of Akshay Kumar for 45 mins. hardly I felt boring in few minutes but I got returns of those minutes in 2nd half which was damn damn damn interesting, gripping and psychological in last 30 mins.In short, I loved this movie so much and it is purely an entertainer and shown us great depth of human psychology and gave a hidden message to stay away from blind faith related to ghost and witches.I admire Bhool Bhulaiya" 
" All the 3 genres I like - horrors, thrillers and comedies","Yet another movie by Priyadarshan , rest assured this movie stands out of the lot. Let me first confess , I have never been a Hindi movies' fan , but I do let them have their moments of glory when I actually do show up to watch some of really recommended movies reason being they don't have many movies to suite my type. Bhool Bhulaiyya (BB) came highly recommended by friends and foes alike. The movie was pretty much to my taste , I have to confess , it was one of those movies that caught my attension and held it throughout the movie. Again , I have to add , the songs were so not needed. If I am watching movies like Dhoom 2 , I really don't mind as the songs are as 'break a leg' melodious as they are in their right places .. plus we all know how those movies are gonna end .. but we show up just to watch some beautiful faces and have a good time. But movies like BB have a suspense to build up ...i mean who likes songs during suspense ... not me. But the movie doesn't let the horror get to you as it also has a scientific angle attached to it. Actors like Paresh Rawal , Akshay Kumar , Asrani and Rajpal Yadav make sure that its not a Bhoot kind of a horror which aims at nothing but to induce horror in it. Shiny Ahuja and Vidya Balan play the married couple. Hey you get to see Amisha Patel as well. Now thats a pretty face which had gone missing. Its all about a newly wed couple who just return from the US of A to a small town in India and go to live in a mansion which was locked away for decades as it was thought of to be haunted. Then the story gets more and more interesting and complicated. Some months back a rather spirited Telugu speaking friend of mine forced me to watch a movie ( not sure which south Indian language was that ) as a part of the bargain because I made him watch Batman Begins. I somewhat liked the movie ..I agreed to it as the movie had Rajnikant ... if nothing else I thought I would certainly get to see some stylish cigarette throwing , chewing gum bouncing , bad guys falling , out of this world style fighting. I remembered a scene from that movie of this King sitting and a dude and a girl in ethnic Indian dance wear dancing in front of the king till the king gets mad at some thing and slices of someone's head. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me , maybe it was a coincidence or maybe the movie was inspired from that one. But anyway I loved BB. A very neat and decent effort I would say. Maybe I praised the movie a little too much for many people but hey the only 3 genres I like are horrors , thrillers and comedies .... and fortunately for me this movie fell under all the three. I would easily give 3 stars out of 5. A must watch !" 
" Haunting Good Fun!","Even with the need for subtitles, a great movie. With the comedic addition I give it 2 Scooby Snacks! Zoinks!"
