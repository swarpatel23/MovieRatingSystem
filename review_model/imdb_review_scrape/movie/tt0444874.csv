" A Parable of the Blessed Fool","MAIN AISA HI HOON: A Parable of the Blessed Fool The film is the love-child of writer/director Harry Baweja and stars Ajay Devgan. For those of you who don't know who Ajay (pronounced ah-JAY) Devgan is, I can tell you that he is one of India's finest actors. In Main Aisa Hi Hoon, Ajay plays an adult male with the mind of a seven-year-old child.  I did not expect to feel comfortable watching my hero Ajay act this role, but his performance just made me love him that much more. Ajay is brilliant in this film; his acting is impeccable and heart wrenching. This wonderful film is a parable about the meaning, the power and importance of Love. It is also a profound and insightful metaphor with into what is happening to people in this world as the plague of greed and ambition spreads around the planet, while love takes a back seat to success, status, and consumption.Ajay's character is a "normal man in an abnormal world"  he loves and that simple love spreads out and touches everyone around him. He has the mind of a child and a heart of gold! Very often in Hindu Sanskrit texts it is suggested that when a yogi achieves enlightenment, he or she should pretend to be the fool. The disguise of the Fool protects. Anyone who is lost in the bliss of Divine Love appears foolish the worldly. Ajay's character is happy, loving, giving, and forgiving.The gorgeous Sushmita Sen plays the successful unhappy lawyer, who is lost in her ambition and feelings of being superior and smarter than everyone.  This lady's performance was unusually excellent, showing real depth of character and feeling. My generation never used the mean term 'loser' to describe people we felt superior to. Those of you who are young probably don't even notice how your world is being altered by greed and the callous attitudes of those who imagine themselves to be smart, superior, and special. You are just trying to 'make it' in the world like so many others  until you wake up alone one day like Sushmita's character and sadly realize that you have forgotten how to love, how to feel, and how to cry.In perhaps one of her best performances, Esha Deol plays the character, MAYA. This Sanskrit word means illusion to most westerners, but a deeper look at the metaphysical nature of the term shows that Maya is more than illusion. Maya is also the creative Shakti power, and this Maya creates a child, which becomes the focus of the film as the forces of evil are eventually vanquished by the power Love.In the film Maya is the lost-rich-girl searching for love, having been neglected by her ambitious rich father who is forever too busy to notice her. She has the symbol OM tattooed on her arm and practices meditation and yoga. She craves the escape of ecstasy and uses hashish to get high.Fate leads her to the protection of Ajay's simple minded, childlike character and his unconditional love, which she cannot resist. But after a year of living with him, she is too attached to her pain to be able to accept his love. Overwhelmed by her personal demonic illusions, and fearful that she will lose him, she leaves him and abandons the child they have created. Maya acknowledges that he is the better person and hopes the child will not turn out like her. The goodness of the 'fool' is valued above all.The essence of the film is that a person who is in a state of unconditional love, who does not judge others, and cannot tell lies is considered to be 'abnormal' in our world.Ajay spontaneously offers Maya the tender shelter of his umbrella even after she has hurt his feelings. He happily forgives everyone. What Ajay does so beautifully throughout the film is to remain in this kind of innocent child-like love. It has been suggested that to find the Kingdom of Heaven, we "become little children" again.Ajay's character has become the patron saint of the town because he is innocently carrying "the Love frequency" and everyone recognizes how his presence enhances their lives. They love him back!At the end of the film when Sushmita tries to explain to him that he is someone special, he is simply not interested. He is what he is and does not require descriptions. He's living 'Being-ness'!This film is a metaphor, a parable, showing the power of Love to overwhelm a lack of love, to vanquish greed and ambition. The windmill toy handed down from Maya's mother to the daughter is an obvious reference to the high-minded, unselfish and impractical Spanish hero Don Quixote.Everyone eventually acts selflessly in response to Ajay - the lawyer takes no fees, the landlady takes no rent, his daughter decides remain like her father because she senses he is somehow better than the world. People simply give to him because they feel what he is, his unconditional Love. Even the grandfather asks for forgiveness.I highly recommend Main Aisa Hi Hoon. Watch this film  not with expectations of another glittering numbing advertisement for a promised-but-never-delivered fake impossible world. Watch MAIN AISA HI HOON as something deeper, a glimpse into the kind of heart and tender closeness we all dream of  the pure Heart of the innocent that does not judge others and cannot tell lies. And bring a big box of tissues!" 
" Indianized version of I am Sam, but also pretty good","Yes OK so it's a take off (rip off?) of I am Sam). Big deal. On the whole it's a good film, but yes I couldn't empathize with the ending as it was seemingly rushed and forced.I really loved the songs, especially "Walk into my life" and "Mere Papa" (ok, so I love the songs in our Hindi movies!).Anyway all the actors were really good. Ajay Devgan is superb as Neel. Sush and Esha are great too. The kid is sweet but a bit too precocious at times. Blame it on Harry I guess.The supporting cast did a great job too.Yes it's almost scene for scene a remake of I am Sam. That aside, I have to say I'm more partial to Ajay Devgan than Sean Penn, but that's just me.Personally this would have been better done as a sequel to Koi Mil Gaya rather than just a copy of an American film." 
" Touching film!","This film is out-and-out a tearjerker. The story revolves around a Ajay Devgan, a mentally challenged man, and his daughter, who has reached the age where she has begun to surpass her dad mentally. Ajay plays innocence personified. He treats everyone as his own, and does not know how to lie. Esha Deol, his long lost love, was never destined to live happily. The happiness she receives from Ajay she finds to be too much to handle after living a dark and lonely life. Sushmita Sen, a top lawyer and a very strong, independent woman, has distanced herself from her son by dedicating all her time to her profession that deals with an ugly face of society. A divorcée, she fights a new battle everyday, in court and in life. Ajay, through his unconditional love, brings out the loving child and innocence in Sushmita. The story is very nice, and characters are well developed, particularly that of Sushmita. Ajay's performance was absolutely fantastic. Sushmita was also good." 
" A movie about a mad man and how he copes with his problems.","I know this film is a copy of I am Sam but I have to say this ones much better.I never really thought of Ajay Devgan as a good actor but this film has proved me wrong,definitely. Esha Deol was good in this film and her other movies as well but her mum is ten times better than her. Sushmita Sen was good and I liked the character she played which was a understanding and descent lawyer who helps Ajay Devgan and his daughter. Lilletey Dubey was good and her acting was better in this film than it was in Kal ho na ho.Anupem Kher was good as playing a bad character in this film but he becomes good at the end.The character for Gungun was good and the character who played Sushmita Sen's son in the film was good as well." 
" okay movie...great acting!","Watch this movie if you like Esha Deol and Sushmita Sen. This movie is given substance only because of the female leads in it. Lillete Dubey and Ajay Devgan's daughter have played their parts extremely well. Ajay Devgan is good as usual, but if you really wanted to watch a movie of this sort, you're better off watching the original, I am Sam. However, if you want to watch some seriously good acting in bollywood, you should go for this movie. Esha Deol is getting better in every movie. We can see the sadness and anger in her eyes when she calls her father up on her birthday but doesn't get through to him. She has an extremely expressive face, and definitely has the potential to be a super star like her parents. Sushmita Sen is awesome, like usual. She just keeps getting better. I thought she acted immensely well in Filhaal, but now I think this movie beats that in terms of her acting. Ajay Devgan has always been good and this is just one more feather in his cap. The whole supporting cast has done a good job as well. Yet, even with the fabulous performances, this movie lacks the essential ingredients of a blockbuster. The songs look like they've been forcefully added and, as I stated earlier, you'd rather watch the Hollywood version of this movie. An okay watch if you have nothing to do on a rainy day. Also, the end result of the case and Sushmita Sen's decision seems a tad bit unbelievable, but I guess that's cinematic liberty! I give this movie a 7 mainly because of the acting!" 
" Good story","Story line of this movie is about a Mad man how he struggle.. with her daughter's wishful life..... Ajay Done very well" 
" An unfortunately Bollywoodized rip-off with surprisingly good acting","Main Aisa Hi Hoon continues a number of recent and not-so recent disturbing trends for Bollywood films. But in the end, it is saved somewhat by decent performances.Most disturbing is the trend for producing uncredited remakes of American films. This is a remake of the far superior I Am Sam (2001). The copyright law in India must be such that it's impossible or at least not worthwhile to sue for these infringements, but artistic integrity and ethics would suggest giving credit where it is due.As bad as the ethical problems is the fact that not many of these uncredited remakes are as good as the films they're stealing from. In Bollywoodizing them and sanitizing them so that they're more acceptable to Indian culture, the producers, writers and directors suggest that they often do not understand what made the films work in the first place.There are a number of such changes in converting I Am Sam to Bollywood that are made to reflect conventional Indian morality and social myths. Here, the main character's one night stand was changed into a very muddled, longer-term relationship; the main character having difficulty coping in normal society was changed into a unbelievable, flawless social support system; questionable philosophical stances built into the system were mostly changed into a vindictive would-be father in law; and an unexpected, budding romance was drained of nearly all development and justification, not to mention that it's capped with a ridiculous bit of plotting at the end.Other stereotypical stylistic changes were made, too, in order to make this a very non-challenging Bollywood film. Songs were added, of course, and although most of the lyrics are a relatively unusual and thus admirable attempt to say something relevant to the dramatic material, the songs and often the style in which they're performed are almost always sorely out of place. Also, melodrama is cranked up to the point of irritation, often accompanied by ridiculous musical or sound effects cues--Bollywood filmmakers seem to believe that their audiences are so stupid that they will not pick up on anything unless they beat them over the head with it. The concern for adding songs, melodrama and making the film not so controversial for Indian audiences resulted in often forgetting the need to tell a story that makes sense for these characters as they are presented. Storytelling should be the first concern in film-making. Concentrate on that and forget about making a combination soap opera/variety show with pointless "fancy" camera work (such as shots of the main character's house sideways and upside down).Maybe surprisingly then, the acting in Main Aisa Hi Hoon is actually pretty good. Ajay Devgan is not nearly as convincing in the role as Sean Penn was, but especially as the film progresses, he turns in a moving, heartfelt performance. Sushmita Sen, Esha Deol and Anupam Kher are also impressive, especially in light of the fact that Bollywood actors are usually encouraged to overact rather than turn in a nuanced, understated performance. I also enjoyed the music, even though the breaks in the story to sing a song didn't fit very well.Still, it's difficult to recommend Main Aisa Hi Hoon. Anyone interested in this story should just watch I Am Sam instead. And please, Bollywood, break some formulas, take some chances, and stop ripping off other films." 
" Ajay and Rucha's Commendable Performance in a Mediocre Movie","Admittedly, this movie bears very striking resemblance to the 2001 film "I am Sam". However, Bollywood maintains the innocence of the storyline with typical twists to conform to a critical Indo-audience now accustomed with modern dramatisations of human behaviour while still expecting good over evil victories at the end of every story.Ajay Devgan and Baby Rucha Vaidya complement each other beautifully, with the latter debut artist performing with just the correct amount of cuteness while demonstrating mature drama portrayal within a multi-star environment. This is typical in the dramatisation of the sentimental song "Papa Mere Papa" in which Gungun, her character, plays tribute to her dad to force Sushmita Sen's character, Niti, "the best lawyer" to realise he dad deserves to maintain custody of Gungun from her maternal grandfather.Devgan's role as a autistic gentlemen Indraneel Thakur, loved by all while maintaining responsible, honest and forgiving qualities is typically brilliant when one considers the diaspora of roles he is considered for. He convinces Sen that she needs to show her son more respect and overcome her workaholic attributes to prevent herself from losing her son as she has her husband. Neel's relative charm is apparent as his associations with the clients at the café at which he works seven days-a-week are shown as they urge him to share his musical talent with them, as in the song "Just Walk into my Life" Anupham Kher plays irresponsible and business tycoon father to Maya Tridevi (Esha Deol), who is Gungun's mother. Maya is forced to leave UK from her non-responsive father and return to India where she becomes a nomad and drug-addict before she is inspired that life can be positively lived with Neel, his friends and carer, Ritu, played by Lillete Dubey. She is overwhelmed with the power of love, and becomes scared of this emotion, therefore leaving the family once she gives birth to their daughter.The storyline culminates with Tridevi senior returning to India to legally claim back his daughter from Thakur, hereby breaking the fragile Neel's personality. There are challenges in the life of Gungun and Neel, with the former trying very hard not to outsmart her dad, but eventually learning that to love him, she must become the strong and intellectual member of their small family.The performances are sterling, however, one feels that the film-makers took the Bollywood license to generate a happy-ending a bit too cloistral. This film has a strong storyline, yet the producers do not balance time spent at specific plot points, such as Esha's exit or at the climax.This said, however, we must admit that the music is beautiful from Himesh Reshammiya and lyricist Sameer, and the overall effort is great from the actors, young, old and young-minded. Understand the nature of Bollywood cinema, and home it becomes more bold in future en devours, but do not judge these efforts without value to the social upliftment producers seek. The audience of Bollywood is certainly intelligent and understand the critique of performance and have ability to share commentary on world matters and contribute significantly to global advancement." 
" I am Sam and I am Sad","Just when I thought I can feel an inkling of pride with the Indian movie scene (3 Deewarein, Swades, Lakshya), it raises it ever present ugly head of "inspiration". The plot and the characters neatly "borrowed" and given a Bollywood Jhatka of usual romantic interest, I am Sam is remade, rehashed and proper FUBSR (fouled up but still recognizable) and Indianised for the huge audience of illiterate masses and sub-literate asses.There isn't much need to delve into the story, people looking forward to this movie (groan) can just scoop up some reviews from the aforementioned Holllywood page here on IMDb and be well prepared to compare Ajay Devgan and Sean Penn, at least that will entertain you for the duration of the movie. Oh, and Ms. Sen says it's her best performance yet, now we know how good she actually is then ;).I hope someday somebody sues Bollywood." 
" The "worstest" movie, if only such a word exists.","What was the last time harry baweja made a movie worth watching? I don't remember, and I guess no one does. Right from the first shot it was clear to me that I'm watching a straight rip-off of some Hollywood flick; how else could I justify some otherwise empty-minded director to come up with a movie based on the life of a autistic person. Not so long ago, sanjay leela bhansali made "Black", and was appreciated by critics as well as the audience; so it definitely makes sense for some crap-assed director like harry baweja to join the league and cache on the sentiments. I really doubt he would have made "main aisa..", had "Black" been a box-office failure.Anyways, come to the storyline. Well, there is nothing really to say except that its a plain remake^Wrip-off of "I am SAM". So if you have seen "I am SAM", don't waste your time on this movie. If you have not, better watch it now, but for god sake, don't look at "main aisa..."; its nowhere close to the original.Ajay has been a good actor otherwise, but here he's been in the wrong hands. Leave aside any of the emotional attachment with the character, due to his overacting, I found him one of the most annoying characters of the movie (of course you are blessed with two more equally annoying characters who know nothing, except to ask everyone's birthday, and say you are the best or bestest or whatever the f***.)Rucha Vaidya, who played the role of the kid, had to play something that no-one understands. Looked like the dialog-writer didn't know much about child psychology; In one frame she asks kiddish questions about rising sun and stars, and in other she feels mature enough to decide 'not to know' more than her father. what the hell!Anupam Kher, after veer-zaara is once again in a similar and quite under-developed role.Esha still has to learn a lot about acting before she can give one single memorable performance. But that doesn't seem like a possibility given the rate at which this girl is accepting the skin-friendly C grade flicks.Sushmita, was probably the only one who did some good job playing the lawyer who is struggling in both her carrier and her personal life. And yes, the two star I'm giving to this movie are just because of Sush. Overall, Poor acting, accompanied with equally poor music and bad narration make it one hell bad of movie; Added to this that you've to sit through almost three hours.Not recommended to anyone." 
" An Acting galore","If you can forgive the director for inclusion of excessive number of irrelevant songs, then this film is very good. The Prime merit of the movie is Sushmita Sen. This is one is her best performance ever. Although Sushmita Sen is an actress way ahead then any other Bollywood heroines, she renders the most perfectly controlled dialog delivery & strong maintenance of her expressions & body language in alliance with thorough involvement in to the character.The Film is based on Neel (played by Ajay Devgan) whose mental growth remains sustained as a child. Neel meets Maya (Played by Esha Deol), a runaway girl from London suffering from her past solitude frustrations. Soon both fall in affectionate relationships & are also gifted with a baby girl. Maya realizes that her life doesn't deserves this happiness and disappears leaving behind the Baby & Neel alone. Esha gives a terrific performance and I firmly believe that her improvement has a strong share of Hary Baweja.When the Child "Gungun" grows 7 year old, she is been suddenly seeked by his Grandfather (Anupam Kher) claiming her custody. This leads to a Court case where Neeti Khanna (Shushmita sen) is the appointed lawyer as Defendant.The prime scene stealers are the special moments shared by Neel & his Daughter which induces touching emotions. Each and every scene where Shushmita appears is just marvelous.Devgan's performance is in one word "Good". But I personally feel that Baweja could have extracted much better out of him.But the film belongs to Sushmita Sen. The scene when she opens up emotionally & crying in front of Devgan by confessing about she being a liar is the best scene I ever saw in recent times. In this scene, Sushmita transforms Neetas emotions from frustration to realization gradually in the most perfect act ever." 
" Pleasant...I guess?","A Hindi remake of "I Am Sam". Ajay Devgan showed alent in a genre much different from his typical action/thriller/horror. He is endearing, and I liked his performance. He has some good chemistry with Sushmita, and is overall, a great performer. Sushmita Sen is disappointing. She looks very glamorous, but fails to provide any proper acting entertainment. The little girl got on my nerves, though she is kinda cute.Music is average, though I like a few songs. Interestingly, many songs are in English, which surprised me, I was not expecting it. I don't like it though, I'm sure many people would have preferred them in Hindi.Its a candyfloss comedy/drama, and sickly sweet. Be prepared." 
" Crap","MAIN AISA HI HOON promos showed up and i was so excited to watch itAjay in a mentally challenged role after DILWALE(1994) was a delight in the promos and i waited for the film to come In fact Ajay had 5-6 releases in 2005 and many of them in the first few months of 2005 in January there were INSAN and BLACKMAIL both craps and in February the much delayed ZAMEER and then the good TANGO CHARLIE and finally this movieBut i waited to watch this but sadly The film is a remake of I AM SAM but the film falters in script level and also there are several loopholesAnother problem is Ajay made to sing and dance is too far fetched and also the characters surrounding him are too clichéd The romance between Ajay and Esha is okay but the reason she leaves him is too difficult to understand also the reason why Anupam wants her back is okay but how does he come to know Ajay is mentally ill before meeting him?The courtroom drama is well handled but the jerky camera work spoils the show yet the courtroom drama does have some good moments but the film drags and gets painfully slow and ends suddenlyDirection by Harry Baweja is decent in parts only Music is okayAmongst actors Ajay did a mentally challenged role in DILWALE(1994) strangely by the same director and was good there Here too he does well but could be far more better in several portions Esha is okay Sushmita Sen steals the show with a natural performance, sadly nowdays she is doing trite Anupam Kher is adequate Vikram Gokhale is okay" 
" Pathetic film","I don't know how any one can make such a pathetic film. I mean everything is weak in this film; the ending is typical Hindi film ending, the story is weak, the dialogues have been repeated in N number of Hindi films and the songs are forgettableHow can a father who cannot bring up a child can lay a claim to his grand daughter when he knows that he has letter from his daughter which can weaken his claim? The arguments in the court are very amateur. The lawyer from the father side is shown to be over confident. The emotional scenes in this film are not touchy and they become a pain to watch. I advice the viewers to skip this film. I wasted my time watching this film and hence I feel that I should let my feelings know to the other members by writing a small preview of this film."
