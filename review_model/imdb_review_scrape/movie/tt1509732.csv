" Aisha, the queen of kitsch","Aisha is a modern-day adaptation of Jane Austen's famous novel Emma. Now I'm personally not into this kind of movies, but I still wanted to see it for Abhay Deol, whom I consider to be one of the most talented actors in India today, and most of whose films and performances I highly appreciated. Aisha actually centres around the young Sonam Kapoor, whose Aisha is a take-off on Austen's Emma. The movie reminds me of many of those kitschy Hollywood fairy tales like The Princess Diaries, and it tries very hard to be western. It actually is supposed to be a fairy tale, but it mostly looks like a wannabe rather than a good movie on its own. Its dialogues, songs, characters, and its overall atmosphere all seem to have been inspired from various foreign movies of this sort, and sadly, not even once does it try to show the beauty of India, using it only in some comic scenes of parody instead. Sonam Kapoor plays the title role, and she is okay. She does manage to carry the film on her shoulders, but despite being pretty and vivacious, she somehow seems to lack the charm her character requires, and at points she gets a bit annoyingly unnatural. Abhay Deol is reduced to a role of minimal importance and by the end of the film I was left wondering what on earth he could find in this movie or role that he accepted it. Aisha is not a complete bore and it does have its moments from time to time, but overall it's an ordinary and rather mediocre tale, which could be easily skipped." 
" A 21st Century Emma Woodhouse in Delhi","I thought Aisha was really cute. As an Emma adaptation, I thought it was excellent- they kept all the important elements of the story in, and I saw a few homages to Clueless in there as well. I like that Aisha wasn't 100% likable, as she shouldn't be- she is a girl who's been given everything in life, which doesn't always lend itself to peachy sweetness. Of course she's going to be arrogant! Nobody other than Arjun ever says no to her.Because this film is about a very wealthy girl and her matchmaking pursuits, which do often come across as very superficial and celebrating monetary pleasures, and the characters are very shallow at times (their problems are hardly anything, compared to the very real struggles other Indians face) I can see how some people might not like it- my dad thought it was absolutely ridiculous (his exact quotes were "I can't believe filmmakers would waste celluloid on this trash").However, the essence of the film is to show how silly Aisha's attempts are at forcing what cannot be forced, regardless of how much she tries to manipulate the situation or how much money she throws at it. She is portrayed as an arrogant girl, but we are shown that doing so ultimately alienates her friends from her. Do the filmmakers celebrate what could be labeled as "western excess" in the process of telling her story? Sure, but who doesn't like seeing pretty clothes and hairstyles once in a while? Aisha Kapoor is not one of the "mango people"- who would expect her to be? The music was terrific, and the supporting cast did a wonderful job- especially Amrita Puri, who played the character of Shefali. For those who have seen Clueless, I definitely felt echoes of Brittany Murphy's character Tai through her performance- in a great way. She was really cute! And Ira Dubey played Aisha's sarcastic friend Pinky (Dion in Clueless) to a T, and Abhay Deol and Cyrus Shankar were great as Arjun and Randhir.I personally highly recommend this film if you're looking for a fun, escapist Jane Austen adaptation with great clothes and danceable music." 
" liked it","Actually I wasn't planning to see the movie , but then I saw this review where this movie was compared to Peepli live .........the writer was whining about how Aisha lives in a different world where no dirt or beggars are seen on the street ,how unrealistic it is , blah blah blah............and how the real world is shown in Peepli etc.........Then I decided to see the movie for one reason --- We go to movies to escape from reality , not to encounter it .........I mean ,what is the point in seeing movies if the same dreariness of real life is shown in them , the same poverty ,injustice .........we go to indulge in our dreams ( which are never going to turn to reality ) ,like marrying beautiful women or rich men ( depending on the gender you belong to -- sorry for being presemptous ,but here I am taking the liberty of thinking that all women want rich men )..........thats why the old movies many a times showed rich people marrying poor people breaching the rich poor gap and all that ........they allowed the poor to indulge in such dreams for three hours..........Coming to the movie , it shows Sonam kapoor as a scatterbrained rich girl who is forever into matchmaking ,but without ever achieving any results........Who cares anyway.........life powered by money is good ,there are lots of parties ,vacations to attend ,polo matches to watch and cheer, shopping malls to visit and run expensive bills , handsome hunks are around to escort you .........above all ,time to play around with.........Her fave project is to fix the marriage of a small town cousin of hers to some rich guy ........here too she fails ,and a small complication develops as the girl ,after other guys have rejected her for precisely her small-townness , falls for the guy Sonam is angling for..........oh poor little Sonam No problems however ,Sonam's father proclaims that this guy will also reject the girl on the same grounds of smalltownness.........and so he does !!!Who cares anyway , Sonam gets to wear fancy clothes , act like a fashion model ,play beach-volleyball in skimpy clothes .........and we get to watch all that........One nice point though .......the parents are non-interfering in the whole movie........a welcome change from other movies where where fighting against the parents' opposition about the marriage takes up half the time ........i was tired and sick of this ( seen too much of it in real life again )...........rest of the movie is all okay......." 
" Feel good, love to hate","Aisha is about this super rich good-hearted luxury-snob who sees nothing beyond anything high class, and she can very well afford to. Sonam Kapoor plays Aisha, who is some sort of a cross between Sex and The City's Carrie (in her quintessential fashion sense) and Cher from Clueless (in her adorable snobbishness). She's into social services such as protecting animal rights, appreciating and creating arts, and not to forget her newly found talent, match making.Teamed with her best friend Pinky, Aisha tries to match make a plain-Haryana-Jane (named Shefali) with her friend Randhir, whom she thinks is perfect for Shefali, but Randhir in fact is in love with Aisha herself. Her only obstacle is Arjun (Abhay Deol), or so she thinks.In a nut shell, Aisha is a feel good movie, with cute and lovely characters, who each leave their mark with their roles and acting, although I felt Abhay Deol was shortchanged for the amount of potential he has. Amrita Puri (Shefali) in my opinion is the best one to watch out for. Sonam is also very lovable in the snobbish role of a high society snob whom we'd love to hate.One downside of the movie is that I felt the movie was really pretentious with the amount of super high flying luxurious life shown, especially with the polo match and unreal river rafting getaway in a well-equipped camp house for the vain people. On a positive note, the movie was some very light hearted moments, even makes a what seems serious love declaration at the wedding function into a light comedy moment. You can't help loving Aisha!" 
" Sit back, relax and enjoy","I mostly love films with a purpose and depth to them. But every once in a while comes a flick with a relaxed tone and an oft repeated story that still knocks the socks off me.Aisha is such a product. Looks to me like the makers had tons of fun, cause I sure did watching it. Featuring a pitch perfect ensemble cast led by the winsome and pretty Sonam Kapoor, Aisha is a tribute to Jane Austen's Emma, but twenty-first century affluent Indians' style.There's little nouveau about the tale, but the performances, screenplay, dialogues, cinematography, music, editing, direction and choreography all weave together in perfect tandem. I'm not kidding; I thought they all came up with an awesome team effort. Each scene is a pleasure to watch.Moreover, the flick doesn't take itself seriously, which was great for me, cause I'm frankly a little tired of the countless Hindi films that purport to be "the Love Story of a Lifetime". Hey people, not every movie has to be Romeo & Juliet or Ek Dujjhe Ke Liye.Bonus for those of us weary of the traditional high volume Bollywood drama. Even when the heroine goes off on a cringe-inducing lengthy monologue about life and her one true love for the climax, we know we're watching a comedy. The director quickly reminds us courtesy a great twist at scene's end. Speaking of which, Rajshree Ojha is a great find. Hope she strikes it big cause she definitely deserves the success.9/10" 
" An average flick...with average performances and below average storyline!!","i watched the flick today and i din' find it convincing...i was expecting a bit more from it..it did not even had the level of entertainment value one would expect watching the trailers of this movie..i went to watch the movie to enjoy to the fullest...thinking of it as one of the urban comedies that would make me laugh..and get involved with the movie...and i came back from the cinema hall reluctantly..Talking about performances..well they were just average...Abhay Deol's expressions were nice...but he was not able to carry himself with the story and the plot of the movie..Sonam was as disgusting as ever when it comes to act...though she looked cute in it..Ira Dubey was much better on CHICKS ON FLICKS rather than wasting her time here and even smooching Cyrus Sahukar...m.k. Raina was just jumping along with the lead actors trying hard as if he is turned 25 again...Cyrus Sahukar was as he is..and others also gave just average performances...yupp..the only girl i can praise is Amrita Puri...being her debut movie...she did a great job..acted better than Sonam Kapoor and many other experienced actors...she was really convincing..the music was very cool..specially the song "GAL MITTHI MITTHI BOL" is already my one of the favorite of recent times..and the title track "AISHA" is also nice...the direction was somehow fresh..but was again just an average direction..cinematography was good...screenplay was okish except in few scenes when it became ultra-slow..all in all...the movie was just average..with a below average story and content..i would rate it 4 / 10 this week...go for DESPICABLE ME..instead of AISHA..at least you would enjoy much more than watching AISHA..!!" 
" Rescue impossible: Emma cries for help!!","There is a scene in the movie where Abhay Deol looks at Sonam and accuses her of being shallow. He may have been talking to the director of the movie. I don't know how many times poor Jane Austen may be rolling in her grave. Forget about adapting from the book (which is a true masterpiece ); it wasn't even able to copy from another classic of its kind. The story does not progress with any logic – scenes seem to have been cut and pasted to fill in the gap. The character Emma is supposed to be a complex one – she is vain, narcissistic and controlling yet has charm and an attractive appeal about her. You love to hate her. Aisha, on the other hand , seemed plain dumb. Fighting with her childhood friend and acting like a bitchy teenager when another hot girl comes into the picture (a totally irrelevant addition) is really not a show of character. The love-hate equation with Abhay Deol should have been crackling but they keep arguing unnecessarily throughout the movie. Sonam doesn't look very convincing in her I-know-what's-best attitude. As for the characters - Sonam has potential but is slowly becoming a bimbo expert. However she usually looks pretty in her movies and has a good sense of style so her styling in the movie seemed way off. The outfits were meant to emulate the Manhattan street style but looked odd and out of place. Abhay is his smart Alec self but looks so disgusted with his co star, you wonder how he fell in love with her. The supporting characters actually add flavor to the movie. Amrita Puri is fabulous, with good roles and opportunity she can make it big. Cyrus looks very genuine and appears to be a typical Delhi boy. Ira Dubey goes from headstrong and blasé to gentle and soft in 2 consecutive frame which confuses everyone. The only scoring point was the movie's music which is very apt , youthful and a true delight..wish the movie was the same..!" 
" Could have been the best adaptation till date, but.....","I caught Aisha accidentally, reached back home early for a change, mom said she is bored sitting all day in the house, wanted to go for the new flick Aisha, even I were excited to the core after catching the promos and the Soundtrack.Aisha is based on the 1815 classic by Jane Austen, 'Emma'. You begin watching 'Aisha' with the nagging feeling that a remake of an 1815 classic, after several adaptations worldwide, is hardly likely to offer anything fresh.Since director Rajashree Ojha and writer Devika Bhagat do make an attempt to retell the story, one would expect some creativity from them. They bring in a new character which is not a part of the original book. Unfortunately that one character - which is Aisha's best friend - has been borrowed from 'Clueless', one of many adaptations of the movie made on screen. 'Clueless' released in 1995, starring Alicia Silverstone, with direction by Amy Heckerling. And that's not it. Both 'Clueless' and 'Aisha' start in similar styles - the protagonist briefing the audience on her world. Worse, both films start with shots of the protagonist driving her car! Having said that, 'Clueless' is a different movie since the writer did bother to alter the storyline.Aisha is a girl who likes making matches and she believes she does it best. When she finds a new friend Shefali (Amrita Puri), who gets into her city just to find the right guy to get married to, Aisha decides to get the perfect match for her. She goes about converting Shefali from a shy small town girl to someone befitting the high society and also tries setting her up with a childhood friend Randhir Gambhir (Cyrus Sahukar) who is in love with Aisha instead. She does not learn her lesson yet, despite being warned by childhood friend Arjun Burman (Abhay Deol). Things only get worse till Aisha realizes she has been a fool.The problem with Aisha is the screenplay. It never gets deep enough to evoke any emotions in the audience. Two major points in the film are when Aisha's two friends decided on moving on with their own lives. But there was no build up for any of them to be justified. And by the time Aisha realizes her love the film hardly managed to create any attention. Having said that, credit should be given where due! The character of Shefali, though stereotypical, is well written and enacted. Amrita Puri does a great job getting brilliant expressions every time she is on screen. She is the star of the movie. The other characters come out well too and there are no faults as long as performances are concerned. Sonam is good and so is Ira Dubey who plays the best friends. Abhay Deol does not have much to do and I think got an underplayed role - something very unfortunate for the talented actor. But he brings the screen alive whenever he is on it. Cyrus Sahukar does a great job too playing the lovable loser. New guy Arunoday Singh impresses and some potential for quite some time in the industry, Lisa Haydon didn't got enough Screen space, but looked ravishing, even Anand Tiwari punched in a cute performance in a peek-a-boo.Technically the film has been shot well. Styling had the front seat here all the big names (from Manish Arora, Anamika Khanna to Chanel and Ralph Lauren, Aisha and her friends just leave you gurgling with glee as they balance the bizarre with the beautiful). Though quite a bit of the film is shot indoors it has been done well. The gloss of the posh South Delhi society comes through. Background and playback music works too. Editing could have been better though. Even Saddi Dilli's essence was 'so' missing, I were yearning for it during the whole show time (sad again)A special mention for Amit Trivedi, he is the future Rahman. He knows his notes and the best part is very few people now is actually aware of music arrangement and that is something Trivedi has a finesse into.Overall, Aisha is best in the promos! The film clearly misses the spark and ends up as an average product. At no point in the story do you feel anything for the protagonist or the people around her. It stays superficial. You would not miss much if you give Aisha a miss!" 
" Watch it for Sonam !!!","Aisha... A good adaptation of the Best Selling "Emma"...The movie has got its own pluses and minuses... The biggest Plus point of the movie is its Music and Sonam Kapoor, Amrita Puri and Ira Dubey's Performance, Sonam has carried the role of Aisha with true sincerity and with elegance, She looked so stunning and her styling was just awesome.. Sonam Kapoor, has the touch of her dad Anil Kapoor who can never do bad acting in any of his movies... Its the same with her...Amrita Puri as a middle class girl was just awesome.. Ira Dubey was awesome... Abhay Doel, no words to describe his screen presence...The other actors have done their bits well and good.. Music and Lyrics are awesome... Now the Minuses... The movie tends to get slow after the intermission and as it reaches climax it gets boring...Watch this for Sonam and the other ensemble cast...Movie - 7/10 Music - 10/10 Performances - 9/10 Overall - 7/10" 
" There's something wrong with reality...","Week after week I push myself into believing that the next movie I watch will not make me want to impale myself on toothpicks. It takes hours of psychiatric therapy and experimental pharmaceuticals... but somehow I manage to do it.And then something like "Aisha" happens. WHY God, WHY?Let's get the facts straight. Sonam Kapoor can't act. She can be subtly (and overtly) bitchy. She can smile the crap out of 35mm cinemascope print. But she can't act. And when you have drunk tweens for a supporting cast who can't decide if they'll do more justice to this country's 220 million poor and hungry wearing Gucci or Versace, well... Abhay Deol (wasted) and Cyrus Sahukar (relief) are there. And they seem to be fighting. But it seems like a lost cause.I also remember the good old days when you needed a story to make a movie. Clearly the good director has transcended that particular limitation. I guess the idea these days is to base it on a well known half remembered piece of literature and hope for the best. Snob value should take care of the rest.Pretty clothes and expensive handbags do not a good movie make. Do yourself a favor and buy the toothpicks instead.2 out of 10. 1 because I'm shallow and don't care for substance." 
" Mind numbing nonsense","The less said about this movie the better. But I have to add 10 lines so here goes. The movie is as shallow as the characters. Every plot element is completely predictable. And this makes it even more frustrating. You find that each and every stereotype is played out. The characters do not do anything to make you relate with them. The lead characters (Aisha) acting makes you cringe every time she opens her mouth. The only thing that that was not completely useless in this movie was the acting of the person who played Shefali.I would have to nominate this as the worst movie of the year. Of the decade even." 
" Mediocre is an understatement","Dear. ... Sonam,Simply unbearable, Sonam Kapoor, I pledge from now on, in whichever movie you will appear, I would stay away from even trailers, forget movie. You overact too much baby, you forget that you are from bollywood. You think that your father born n bred you in LA or NY. So poor baby..You are from India. Get it straight to your head. Overacting is something what I hate.The way you act, I actually get blushy moments on your pathetic attempt to copycat F.R.I.E.N.D.S Jenny's inevitable style, I request you to get natural and please act like you've been born n brought up in Mumbai/Delhi wherever you belong, not being Kardarshian. Sonam, I ......never believed in you. Believe me, never. Last I saw your glimpse in Saanwariya, it was apparent that either Sanjay leela bhansali had indebted truckload of money to your father or worst your father was intimate with him, thus your surprising inception in film industry has been justified. I am not saying you don't have talent or looks.........so what, even I have got loads of talent and great looks, then? My father isn't a human bear, with hairs on the corpse body more than you have got talents in your bootie and some solid luck with B'wood. You were horribly awful in the movie. I got swayed away by 4 star ratings which TOI, and many other newspapers gave you. And I swear, the day I will lose hope of life, the day I will accept that their is no other way left, I will start reviewing movies. I lost my 200/- + snacks ~ 400/- like ........whooooosshhh! All I needed was just a place to place my ass in this sweltering delhi heat where I had decided a dayout with ma friends, else I would have preferred indoors. Pls avoid acting for goodness's sake!" 
" The whole movie is like you have seen that hundred times before.Watch Clueless again even after Two Decades its much much better.","AISHA – CATCH IT ( B- ) Aisha is inspired by international Best seller Emma and the scenes of the movie are ditto copy of Alicia Silverstone's Clueless. The whole movie is like you have seen that hundred times before. The movie is really stylized and Sonam Kapoor looks really Hip. She acted really well and looked like an elite gal. Amrita Puri and Ira Dubey were amazing; they were funny and acted really well. Abhay Deol is like a dead fish, I don't know why people cast him, I found him incredibly boring. Lisa Hayden, Cyrus Shahukar and Arunoday Singh were perfect. Overall it's a complete chic flick, which we have seen hundred times, so watch it if you want to see a Hindi version other wise leave it. Watch Clueless again even after Two Decades its much much better." 
" A wannabe American movie","I have not read 'Emma'...but the concept seemed really hilarious. I was really keen to watch this movie that looked very stylish....but when I did...it was like horror and shock unfolding before my eyes.For one...the movie is too Americanised. All characters dress the way Americans do...they wed the American way and even education system is American (Aisha mentions how Arjun once changed her grade from 'F' to 'A'....which school in India uses the grade system?) Two...none of the actions of the characters seems believable and equations of characters change abruptly. Pinky Bose abruptly decides to break her friendship with Aisha to pursue a relation with Randhir. Shefali, who had been following her advice on relations like a puppy, suddenly decides to go her way. Dhruv Singh abruptly seems to be in love with Arti Menon. There seems to be no build-up for it.Three...The lead of the film Aisha seems just too superficial. Agreed that the lead don't have to be perfect....but shouldn't her actions have some tiny little logic. Her criteria to match people is just based on how they look together...which is OK for a 13 year old....not someone as old as Aisha. So she matches Shefali with Randhir coz they look good together...though she personally believes Randhir to be a loser. In the end...there seems no logic for a mature, reasonable Arjun to actually fall in love with superficial airhead like Aisha....this again, happens abruptly.I'm sure the writer and director can come up with a good product....next time, they should focus less on clothes and more on the plot and its execution ;)" 
" Pretty Good if not Awesome","I watched the movie on the second day and was greeted by a full house.The movie is an indianised version of Jane Austen's Emma, and yet Aisha doesn't fail to impress.Unfortunately termed as a "chick flick" even before it's release, Aisha is actually an insight into the world of relationships and high profile life in Delhi.The movie tracks the life of Aisha played by Sonam kapoor who tries to hitch her new not-so-modern friend Shefalli(Amrita Puri) with her friend Radhir(Cyrus Sahukar) despite being told not to do so by her other childhood friend Arjun played brilliantly by Abhay Deol.With the supporting cast Ira Dubey, Lisa Haydon and Arunoday Singh also confused about relationships chaos is bound to follow! The role of Aisha is almost tailor made for Sonam Kapoor and she does a good job. Abhay Deol as I mentioned earlier is brilliant in the role, he proves himself once again after movies like oye lucky and dev D, as one of the most talented actors in Hindi film industry today. The supporting cast of Ira Dubey and Cyrus Sahkur ensure a few laughs, Amrite Puri is also great and fits the bill as a small town girl. Lisa Haydon and Arunoday Singh add to the glamour.Then there is Anand Tiwari, who has starred with Ira Dubey earlier in The president is Coming, in a small role, he too does a decent job.Overall the acting is great and natural, making it believable for the audience, which is supported by good directing. Indeed the movie is very well shot. One of the talking point of the movie are it's dialouges, which are well written, quirky and suitable for the characters.The Music department also succeeds and credit goes to Amit Trivedi. Tracks "Suno Aisha" and "Gal mithi Bol" will having you humming to their tune.To sum it up Aisha, despite having a predictable second half, is a very good and engaging watch. I recommend you make time for it and I do hope that other bollywood movies take inspiration from movies like Aisha, and make simple, short and yet meaningful films.3 to 3 and a half stars out of 5 for me." 
" Style over substance","Lets be clear that style is more important than substance in this film. Its almost a paid promo for Sonam and the brands she endorses.. L'Oreal / Dior / Elle / Louis Vuitton getting as much footage as some of the characters. What keeps it together are some good punch lines and very good performances from Abhay Deol (who basically carries the film on his shoulders), Ira Dubey (plays her part to perfection) and Amrita Puri (who puts heart into the girl from Bahadurgarh). They manage to hold it reasonably together till the first half but then it starts to fall apart. Key reason is that we never understand why the characters behave the way they do because character development is sacrificed at the altar of fast paced storytelling. And promoting Sonam, making sure she is always the centre of attention. And its all very predictable. For more on this movie & other reviews visit apurvbollywood at blogspot"
