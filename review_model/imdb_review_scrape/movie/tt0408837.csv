" Extremely Sexy......","Hawas meaning Lust is a Erotic Bollywood movie. The storyline is a copy of Hollywood Movie Unfaithful. There has been a few recent releases with the similar story lines about a married woman who has an affair with somebody else (Murder, Fun, Aksar etc). Replacing Diane Lane is Newcomer and model / item number girl Meghna Naidu. Meghna became quite successful from the Hit song Kaliyon ka Chaman. Meghna looked extremely Sexy and danced nicely. Unfortunately her acting wasn't appreciated by most critics, which is why she isn't having much luck bagging good roles for Bollywood films. The actors of this movie were also First timers with not much good acting skills. Bollywood was suppose to be for family viewing with no nudity and adult scenes. But as time is moving, so is Bollywood. Hawas is a start in adult genre in Bollywood after the success of Jism and Murder. Hawas did not do too well because it was released at the same time as Murder. Both movies had same storyline, but Murder was more professionally directed and the actress was critically more sexier. Too my opinion, i think Meghna is very sexy although she has put some weight, I would still bang Meghna from behind like the guy does in the movie." 
" One of my all-time favorite movies (from today)","I've watched only the first 25 minutes of this movie until this moment, and it has already seem to be a strong contender for one of my all-time favorites. There is a possibility that this would even replace my all-time top favorite, Loha.I came to watch this movie after another of Karan Razdan's masterpieces, Ei8ht: Shani (Surrender to the power of Shani). That is also a great movie, but this is way better. Extremely bad (over)acting, ridiculously idiotic dialog delivery, poor script!! Wow! So bad that it is good. No, it is great.PS. OK, I am done watching it. I loved the acting part the most. Meghna Naidu's acting is excellent; one loves the stop-animated way in which her emotion changes: She talks, waits for a few seconds and then suddenly outbursts if she needs to change into another mood, be it happiness, sadness, coyness, excitement or whatever. She has only two facial expressions: one is smiling, and the second is squeezing her face. Needless to say, it is a fact that Karan Razdan did not make her a heroine for her acting capabilities, but rather for her bodily assets, which he then somehow does not fully utilize. The other two central characters also have only one expression each: the husband has the expression of a robotic assassin sent from the future, and the lover is perpetually euphoric and carefree, probably a result of excessive and habitual intake of fine grade cocaine.Watch it. Highly recommended.10 out of 10."
