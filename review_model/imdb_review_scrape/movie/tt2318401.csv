" A happy surprise","Finished watching this one an hour back. And it was a pleasant surprise. Very realistic and hard hitting movie. The kind of movies that you get to see only in Sundance.I generally don't do reviews, but after watching this movie, I happened to come across a review in a large news paper. That review was very unfair review. Movie lovers should go and watch the movie and make your own opinion. Those big news papers run their own agenda- praising a movie so realistic and de-glamorized may have been difficult for them.First half is all about strong character buildup, 2nd half is crisp and takes the viewer on roller coaster ride. Music of the film is excellent with Jagjit Singh song Mrigtrishna placed perfectly at the right spot. Back background score is dark, and melts into the poignant scenes. Dialogues are meaningful researched and well thought, although i found something funny about the dialog "To become a man, you have to learn two things, how to shoot a gun and how to use a condom". Its funny in Hindi. A twisted Narrative keeps you engrossed. Censor Board went a step ahead by allowing the film to go ahead. There are some scenes, that need a strong heart. But, you know those are real because you hear about such events in news papers. Two surprising twists in the story keeps the viewers hooked. All in all its hard hitting, rustic film which viewers get to see rarely by Indian Filmmakers. Voice of Jagjit Singh singing the Song Mrigtrishna - his last song before he died, will make you miss him." 
" A must watch movie which shows the realistic view of politics in India","Aditya Om has given good story but maybe with less characters. Lochan yadav is played convincingly by newcomer Arshand Khan. The music score is also biggest surprise package. Altaf Raja is very grand in his comeback and should sing more in future. I loved Manisha kelkar bold scenes and also role of Aditya Om is played very convincingly. India needs more movies like Bandook. The dialogues are very true like in daily life in India. The progress of movie is good and I liked the climax. Aditya should have more fight scenes with hand. Characters in movie are lifelike and realistic. I hope movie is released with item song for us to enjoy. In theater public was enjoying the dialogues very much." 
" A Must watch film from a debut director Aditya Om which has great story, music and cinematography. A real pleasure to watch.","This is my first review of a film. I went to see this movie because of strong recommendation of one of my friend. I was skeptical at first but got involved in the film within first 15 minutes. Cinematography of this film is really great. Mr. P. Amar Kumar has done a great job. Music of this film is a very strong point and gives justice to the script. Some of the songs "Baware Naina" and "Mrigtrishna marusthal ki" are really great.As the story unfolds, we came across many characters like Lochan Singh, Hari Om Tripathi, Kajri and Hero of the story Bhola who are impossible to forget. Casting of this film is a really strong point. It has been days since I saw the movie but still I remember these characters. Hari Om Tripathi's dialogues reminds me of Chanakya, who managed the first Maurya emperor Chandragupta's rise to power at a young age.One more thing I noticed was use of camera techniques. Close up of eyes and face of the characters in various scenes are very effective. In my opinion technically this film is really excellent. It is really a pleasure to watch this movie. I am really fascinated by "some never before seen" scenes. I don't want to be a spoiler so I am not going to disclose these scenes. You should see those in movie. However I would like to mention a scene where Kajri (Manisha Kelkar) breaks down. I was dumbstruck while watching that scene. She has given her 100%.The dialogues are awesome. Bhola is really convincing character. I appreciate Aditya Om for not letting him just another Action Hero from any other action film. We get involved in Bhola's life. Aditya Om deserves credit for this.Lochan Singh (Arshad Khan) and Hari Om Tripathi (Ashish Kotwal) are two characters worth mentioning here. This review would not be complete if I ignore them. This story is not only about Bhola Kevat, but it is about power struggle and ambitions.The climax of this film is very unique, I was really on the age of my seat while seeing the climax. At the end, I was really happy to see this movie. After a long period, I have seen something from debut director." 
" It fires but misses the target","Director, scriptwriter and actor Aditya Om had so many things in his mind to surprise the audiences but things did not come out as he conceived. Actually, he has conceived some good scenes first then started thinking to link them. That's why, scenes are good but did not gel with the story. Few scenes and shots are very innovative but movie is in bits and pieces. Dialogues are very impressive in the genre of film. Story and its presentation is just OK. There was no any need of love track but they stuffed it. Characterization is also jerky. Performance wise the main lead Bhola (Aditya Om) does not look like among the people and premises, whose story is being told. His skin looks very fresh that he always carry some invisible air conditioner or super strong sunscreen with him self. He had tried to justify his fair complexion by the cause that he is illegal child of Raja Saheb but he forgot that complexion doen't not matter, texture matters. His normal look is very urban. Look changing is not as simple as growing beard. If he decided to play a very rural, rustic guy then he must have learnt from Saif Ali Khan' look as Langda Tyagi from OMKAARA. His acting is OK. Main female lead, Manisha Kelkar is just OK but very impressive in particular a scene , where she breaks down. One actor, who played character of Lakhan Singh , is very good. He leaves his mark as an actor. Music by Mr. Nishith Kamat is fantastic. Music is the highlight of film. It supports film's mood very well. Lyrics are also very good. One song "BAWRE NAINA..." is superb. Even song, sung by Late Jagjit Singh "Marichika maruasthal ki" is good. You will enjoy the music but negative part of it is that they have shown just a glimpse of it, not the full track. I would have loved to watch "Bawre Naina" complete song. Eventually, if you are in trying mood then it can be tried once." 
" What an entertaining movie especially for Crime Movie Buffs","I like crime movies and that was the reason I decided to watch this movie today. Its amazing that this film has almost no well known actors and yet every actor performed his role to perfection. Casting Director has done a wonderful job.Great Diaglogues, great acting and of course great direction.People who don't like crime movies or detest violence and profanity shouldn't waste their time with this title.This movie is in the league of movies like "Gangs of Wasseypur", "Satya" etc.Positives: Story, Direction, Acting, Dialogues, Music. Negatives: Violence and Profanity (But then what do you expect from a crime movie)Happy Watching !" 
" Bandook is better than Guns Of Wasepur","Bandook has bettered the Guns of Wasepur, in terms of storyline, realism and use of the cinematic language. The dialogs are minimalist and characters realistic. Only, downside I see, was the posh makeup of the character played by Manisha. Though she acted well, she could not pass- off as a village woman, due to her hair cut and groomed looks. Rest of all the characters well acted. Hats off to the Bandook team. The story moves at a fast pace. This movie may not be hit with the box office, as it lacks the typical Bollybood masala of raunchy songs (item songs as they call it in Bollywood), and fist fights to show-off the so called "Hero"." 
" Very good Music and Cinematography","I am very impressed with the music of this film. The great Jagjit Singhji has sung last song of his life. "Mrug Trishna Marusthal ki" is really a masterpiece. Nikhil Kamat has done a really good job. He has given justice to all songs.The song "Chunav Re" is good too. I even kept "Tu jaldi bata de" as my caller tune for few months.Aditya Om is successful in portraying the scenario of rural politics in interiors of India. All the characters in this film are real. Cinematography is really good. Those who can not tolerate realities of life should not watch this movie. Congratulations to all characters in this movie. Boys you have done well."
