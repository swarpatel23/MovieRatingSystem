" Lovely Movie!!!","Khoobsurat- Actually a beautiful movie. no doubt the starting was a bit slow but the audience never gave up like Milli didn't and continue the treatment for Mr. Shekar. Sonam Kapoor's Every action had very natural effects in it. The way she sat, ate, laughed, walked, jumped hence everything she did was her true side. But, on the other hand the Royal Family had strict rules and for them Sonam was no less than a retarded Doctor. Fawad Khan like always has acted very well and his face expression were way too amazing. It is a MUST watch movie as The songs are worth listening to. The cinematography rocked and undoubtedly everything was Magnificent." 
" This Is a Fun ride,,,Sonam at last showing her actual acting capabilities","kHOOBSURAT- This is a hell lot of fun ride....Seriously am a person who actually think that Sonam Kapoor cant act or i can say she is a bad actress.....I only liked her acting in 'Delhi 6' and a little bit in 'Mausam' & 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'....But she proved me wrong ,, this time she nailed it.....Still will not say that she is a great actress but if the character suits her than she can act really good (her character in Delhi 6 and Khoobsurat are too similar and i think its the best character for Sonam)..... Trailer has almost shown the whole story of the movie,,,,but its not about the plot but about the screenplay and the execution.........There are moments to watch which will make u laugh out load,,,,there is silliness in the humor which is most welcome(of coarse the movie is by one of the biggest production house of Hollywood-.Disney which is actually famous for making childish movies)........ Therd is romance , there is emotion and a lot of comedy......There are so many good dialogs in the movie that i cant tell then in the review...... Sonam as Milli Chakrabortyis brilliant,,,,she say everything which comes to her mind,,,,and never hide anything in her mind......This is one character which is made for Sonam Kapoor...... Fawad Khan who is a Pakistani TV serial actor is a great discovery for bollywood.....He has a royal look in him....Everything from hair to Beard to shirt to tie to trouser looks royal in him.....I have never seen any bollywood actor looking so good in a royal outfit.....he is a good actor too,,,,and may have a great future in bollywood..... Kiton Khet as a Punjabi mother get some best lines of the movie and sleepwalks through the role which she has done hundred times..... Ratna Pathak as a strict disciplined mother did well and her character matches to her own character from the program Sharabhai vs Sharabhai..... The cinematography has been brilliant,,,,whole royal feel of Rajasthan fits perfectly in the movie.....Background score is quirky as needed ,, but number of songs should have been reduced.....The flow of the movie was so good that some sad songs breaks it...... Few minutes before the pre climax part having some sad scenes of about 10 min was the only boring part of the movie......That is negligible...... There are some jokes related to the tone which royal families use while saying Hindi,,,watch out for those..... Sonam should do more movies like this...... 7.8/10.. by ANuP APu KuMaR....." 
" It was a fantastic family entertainment","I would say it was a Disney thing. Family, comedy, romance and drama. Couldn't control the loudness of my laugh quite a few times. I won't like to compare this Khoobsurat with Rekha's Khoobsurat as standards have been changed a lot in this long long gap. Sonam Kapoor done a lot better than her previous works after Delhi 6. Fawad Khan's face expressions were more than amazing. He is a good looking good actor. He has done a superb work here. Kiron Kher was typical entrainment with her famous Punjabi style as seen in 'Total Sayapa' and her other movies. Cinematography was done marvellously.cons. Music area needed more attention. Just felt few usual overdone scenes. Last couple of minutes were not felt live as expected to be.Overall it was entertainment, rather say enjoyed my 127 minutes." 
" A Nice Light Hearted Movie!!!!!","Khubsoorat!!!!! If you are looking for a pleasant 2 hours - this 1 is for you. Plot Review: Its a simple movie portraying what happens when the heroine a happy go lucky Doctor who is completely alien to discipline and formalities sets foot in a orthodox royal family where we have the hero. Acting: Sonam Kapoor is brilliant and Fawad Khan has the royal looks & complements Kapoor, Kiron Kher is a character as usual with a good supporting cast led by ratna pathak. Pros: Its the Grandeur,photography and soft background music that makes this movie a 2 hour totally pleasant journey. Cons: Lack of intensity, but then its a mandatory ingredient & hence cant really be considered a con." 
" As the name says....the movie is Beautiful...........","After a sometime now...have seen a movie which makes u feel good about it.I am not a huge fan of sonam, but she performs well here so as fawad .He fits to the role perfectly.The other actor are good to there roles.The movie is a feel good movie doesn't bore atall.....loved it!!! The music is good and background score is superb....there are some really good moments in the movie which makes it worth a watch....hope these kind of movies come along.ZNMD was last movie which comes to category of feel good movies....if u want to have 2hrs of good time then this is movie.Hope to see these kind of movies.............cheers ....." 
" Great movie","It is the best movie i have seen in whole year :) Very nice story, good songs, best acting by all actors specially my most favourite sonam kapoor and yes off course by Fawad khan :) A warn welcome to one more khan in Bollywood. I know you will rock bollywood with you amazing acting skills and best looks. All locations are very well selected and everything seems to be in order. The director of this movie must have worked so hard to make such an amazing movie. I'll give this movie 10 out of 10. I am sure everyone here will agree with me on this rating. ENJOYED A lot WATCHING THIS GREAT COMEDY + ROMANTIC MOVIE WITH MY Fianc√© :) BEST FEELING IN WHOLE WORLD :D I recommend all of you to go watch this movie and have a great time with your beloved ones." 
" Not just a chick flick","I watched this movie not just because my wife wanted to watch it, but also because it is a Disney Production. This fairytale has enough punches and turns to keep you interested and aligned with the story. It lives up to the expectations of audience by including a number of activities and events that are known to all of us. For instance, some of the hobbies and postures used by the protagonists are funny yet common.I liked the set up and all the actors played their characters well. The USP of this movie for me is the fact that it connects with you in no time and then maintains it till the end." 
" Had fun watching it, a chill-out fun ride, enjoy!","We went to watch it last night & had really good time. I don't understand the bad reviews about this film as it is way better than some of the over-rated bollywood flicks. I am from UK & enjoy watching foreign movies too & am used to reading the subtitles. It was a recommendation from a friend so we went together to the theatre & I was pleasantly surprised at how this movie managed to keep me entertained from start to finish.Fawad Khan I believe is a new actor as I can't remember seeing him in another movie before. Neither have I seen Sonam Kapoor in many films in the past. Definitely a quality new entry in the industry, keep up the good work.I emphasize on this again I really can't see why there are some negative reviews, probably they were in a bad mood or having a bad day I guess..... My suggestion is if you are thinking of watching it its better to watch it in the cinema as its such a magical fun ride with some good songs, well at least I enjoyed. Sonam Kapoor is a gorgeous young lady absolutely beautiful & I hope we will see her in more quality productions like this one. When I go to a theatre & come out in the end with a massive smile on my face that means I really had a good time & Khoobsurat made me do that.My rating a solid 9.5/10 Have Fun!" 
" Refreshing one after those mundane bollywood films.","Honestly I don't like Sonam Kapoor. And that was why I put it off even though I had this movie on my pen drive since ages. Out of boredom I've decided to give it a try. And it was definitely worth it. I won't comment about Sonam's acting skills. But other than that, the movie was a really good one. Never a dull moment. All the scenes were well balanced. Comedy was well brought out. A few people say it doesn't portray the classic well, but fun is there if all the movies are made alike. The title itself tells about the 'misfit' part. Sonam might be a troll when it comes to acting, but one should agree she's got a good fashion sense. Finally, its definitely worth a watch." 
" Thankfully its not a straight remake of the famous Hrishi Da classic and a fairly enjoyable venture too unexpectedly.","Many would agree to the fact that this was one particular film which everyone was expecting to be a pretty bad remake of the famous Hrishikesh Mukherjee-Rekha classic having the same title (with different spellings) released in 1980.But surprisingly that is not the case since the film is not at all a straight remake of the 80s path breaking film from any angle. And the major argument behind this declaration is that Hrishi Da's script was actually about a young energetic girl entering into the house of her newly-wed elder sister and dealing with her strict mother-in-law running the house with her own self-dictated discipline. Whereas the present 2014 official version is about a physiotherapy doctor visiting her client's royal mansion in Rajasthan, looked after by a strict mother and her young son, instead of her old disabled husband.So where the original was about the in-laws and the new big family where an elder sister has been married in, the latter is about a completely stranger family and that too of only 4 members, without any traditional values to be taken care of other than the professional ethics of a doctor. And anyone living in India can easily understand that how difficult and different a script becomes when you are talking about the elder sister's in-laws confronted by the younger sister visiting the house for a few days in comparison of a doctor staying in her patient's mansion taking it as a professional assignment.Hence clearing all doubts, Hrishi Da's unforgettable gem KHUBSOORAT stays untouched excelling in its own distinctive theme and Shashank Ghosh's current venture just revolves around the same basic plot but doesn't copy any of the original film sequences as it is, despite being an official version.Moving over the remake status, the film begins interestingly with the elegant Fawad Khan and the hyper and ever-smiling (overdoing it) Sonam Kapoor as the (too) young physiotherapy doctor. It keeps moving at a good pace with an all likable feel before the interval and has only two avoidable, filmy sequences to put you off in its initial half. The first one is the below average and cheap song sequence of "Engine Ki Seeti" and the other is a ridiculous kidnapping scene which contributes just nothing. Still the overall enjoyable mood and few light comic moments manage to keep you engrossed and one forgets these pretty weak, silly insertions as it moves further.Post interval the only factor which goes against the movie is that even if you haven't seen the original, you still exactly know what's going to happen next. But again this demerit of an all predictable progression gets smartly covered by two fine performances by Fawad Khan and Aamir Raza Hussain superbly along with few immensely likable, innovative songs composed well. Also the film gets a great support from its final 20 minutes which do have a killer scene between Fawad and Kirron Kher. And therefore what you take back home while moving out of the theater is a smile with 'no complaints' kind of feel despite having watched an all predictable film right from the word go. Speaking specifically this is not a Sonam Kapoor film like the original was a Rekhamovie all the way. The new age version is more of a collective effort with some very important contributions coming from Fawad Khan, Aamir Raza Hussain, Kiron Kher and above all the intelligent, innovative background score which keeps the energy flowing. Few enjoyable sequences and entertaining dialogues offered at regular intervals lift up the film repeatedly and the two songs, "Naina" and "Jo Main Aisa Jaanti" (by Sneha) build up the mood in a beautiful manner. Plus whenever Sonam's ringtone says "Maa Ka Phone Aaya" it does make you laugh effortlessly. And here I am not talking about any of those commercial, deliberate tracks wrongly promoted on the channels instead of the other well-made songs in its soundtrack.In the performance section, Sonam leads from the front as per the script but not as per the impact on the viewers. No doubt she is much better, bright and energetic from all her previous films, still her act largely remains dependent upon the supporting cast till the climax unlike the original. Also she strangely vanishes from the screen for a good amount of time towards the end, though everyone keeps talking about her as the center of attraction. Fawad Khan in his debut movie excels in the same way as he does in his serials. The boy certainly has a special controlled charm in his stylized performance that helps the film big time including the comedy sequences, especially in the climax. Ratna Pathak Shah suffers due to a confusingly written character and is no-where close to her mother doing the same role in the Hrishi da classic. Aamir Raza Hussain adds a lot to the overall impact of the film despite being limited to a wheel chair throughout. Kirron Kher, playing the Punjabi mother once again seems to be a bit loud at the beginning and I personally didn't like Sonam calling her by name with a "Tu- Tadaak" kind of approach in the film's opening moments. However the balancing scene in the end explained the importance of that particular approach quite entertainingly and I got my answer from the writers. Further capturing the outdoors and the big mansions as a part of the script, the DOP does its job skillfully and so does the supporting cast in a reasonable manner as required.Summing up, this first presentation of Disney does have a routine, predictable script having few major drops too. However its young and lively feel, accompanied by some crisp editing, good performances and an innovative background score cover up its minuses well and result in a fairly enjoyable, clean family entertainer respectfully living up to the reputation earned by its title." 
" Simple and Funny script....Key for its Success","Sonam/Fawad's Khoobsurat will stole your heart because of its good acting, fresh and quirky dialogues, and a nice gorgeous set...Mili Chakroborty, enters into a royal family, controlled by a strict disciplined Maharani(Ratna Pathak Shah), to treat her grieving husband in wheel chair. Though According to her the young Prince is Khadus(Fawad Khan), but how she gelled up and become a part of this over disciplined Family, is Khoobsorat all about...Good Points: 1) Acting- Sonam as Mili is a treat to watch, Simple, bubbly, carefree Sonam, maturing as an actor and was quite convincing. She looked gorgeous in every costume, Her Portrayal was so simple, that you will fall in love with Mili...And the way she delivered Dialouges were utterly Cute.. Kiron Kher as Manju is a typical punjabi lady who never thinks twice before using any damn word..Her comic timing was perfect and she was the life of the entire movie. She carried the role so perfectly as if it was made for her, wonderful actress she is. her conversation with Mili will tickle you again and again. A Desirable mom... Ratna Pathak Shah, as usual a perfect choice for a Sophisticated, well dressed , discipline freak, Strict Maharani...Her expression, her way of Saying 'ANTIQUE' is so perfect, She was a perfect contrast for Kiron Kher.. Fawad Khan, Handsome, perfect expression, Subtle acting are some words that will describe the actor from over the border..He was perfect as a prince...who tried to control her lust/love for Mili throughout the movie in a Strict and Sophisticated way...ha ha ..funny...his mute conversations with Mili were one of those many funny parts... Aditi Hayderi, Pretty as hell..2)Dialouges: The charm of the entire movie were dialouges...they were perfect, full of one liner punches, ticklish and fresh...they will keep you involved throughout the movie3) Background: one of the best Set I have seen in recent time movies...it was remarkable and mesmerizing..4) Music: each and every Score are good and perfect for every situation...engine ki seeti and maa ka phone are funny and fab..5) Costumes: Oh my my... Pretty Pretty Pretty..Bad Points: The story was predictable and was loosing its pace in the second half for around 15-16 minutes...U can seriously Go and watch it and will come out laughing...." 
" THE BEST MOVIE EVVEEERRRR CREATED!!!!!","When she pops the athletes leg like ooooooh that sound. Mili has the most beautiful, extravagant style. I love all of the grandma sweaters and neon leggings that give her a major camel toe. Her stupidity, clumsiness, and rude manners are her best characteristics. Girl can blow a bubble! I love how she gets so up close and personal (literally) to everyone. I was so relaxed and enchanted by the sweet romance throughout the entire film. The love that Mili and Vikru share is so amazing. They have the best relationship ever. This movie will bring you to tears. I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO FRICKING MUCH, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU WATCH THIS GORGEOUS MOVIE!!! I LUV Khoobsurat!" 
" One of the more underrated films of 2014","Khoobsurat is one of Sonam Kapoor's best performances. It is about a happy-go-lucky physiotherapist who comes to a royal family's house to treat the family patriarch. How she treats her patient and interacts with the family is the rest of the story. Sonam Kapoor plays the bubbly Dr. Milli Chakravarty with ease. Her mannerisms and actions are absolutely hilarious and make this film a treat to watch. Today she is known more as a fashionista than as an actress. I believe this film will start to make everyone see her as a leading lady. Fawad Khan, who is a well known actor in Pakistani Cinema and Television, is great in his debut. He seems confident and he compliments Sonam Kapoor very well. His performance as the disciplined Vikram Rathore is something to watch out for. Ratna Pathak and Kirron Kher are great in their supporting roles and do not go unnoticed in the film. Overall this film is funny, romantic and makes a great date night movie. This film was not talked about as much as other films such as Haider and Queen, but I believe it should be because I think it is one of the top 10 movies of 2014. Catch it whenever you can and you will enjoy the film." 
" Why are we being served with such Junk !","Just plain awful. I am not a being fan of Sonam Kapoor's high flying attitude and awful over acting but still decided to give this movie a shot. Turned out I was wrong, this movie turned out to be disaster. No comedy (rather irritating comedy) and no story line what so ever. Nothing that you would not have seen more than 50 times before. Songs are plain disgusting and sometimes even kind of cheap. Bolloywood is serving us complete junk this year with the intention to survive by heavily marketing this Junk. My suggestion would be to skip this disgrace of a movie and go watch an English film instead or spend your time on something else. You will be glad that you did." 
" Horrible, pathetic. Totally avoidable.","One of the most horrible movie. Sonam Kapoor has overdose of over-acting. Pathetic to watch. Songs are painful. Total waste of money and time. Sonam Kapoor should look for some other career option instead of wasting people money and time. Only Kiron Kher impresses. It seems Anil Kapoor must also be thinking why did he had to produce such a movie. Sonam Kapoor should play second fiddle if she still want to act. Comparing Rekha's Khoobsurat with Sonam Kapoor's movie will be an insult to both Rekhaji and the old Khoobsurat. Please avoid this movie and save money, time and headache medicine cost. Fawad Khan has done justice to his role."
