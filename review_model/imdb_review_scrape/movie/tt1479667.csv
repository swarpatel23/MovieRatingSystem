" Decent fare","I had absolutely no expectations towards watching "Aagey Se Right" and with that I was not quite disappointed. The are two tracks in the movie running in parallel. One is Talpade's recovery of the lost gun and second is the extremists who has hopelessly fallen in love. Between the two there are adequate moments to tickle your funny bone.Ξ Shreyas Talpade:: He did full justice to his role. After Welcome to Sajjanpur its an honest performance. And he was dashing in the getup of Security In-Charge at the climax of the movie.Ξ Kay Kay:: Gives another shot to attempt comedy (after Sankat City) - but given what he is, he is impeccable. Irfan Khan and Kay Kay are like Om Puri & Naseeruddin Shah of contemporary times.Ξ Vijay Maurya:: Another actor to watch out for. As always he is exceptional in his delivery.Ξ Mahie Gill:: Pity after "Dev D" I was expecting her to choose wisely. There was hardily any meat in the role and was reduced to a poster girl with one song thrown in.Ξ Shenaz Treasurywala:: Needs acting classes badly. Facial expression doesn't qualify to be termed as acting. And to pitting opposite Kay Kay is a big No-No! The mini-me romantic track couple ie. Shiv Pandit and Shruti Seth were okay'ish - its their characters which were foolish.The rest of the star-cast was adequate. The song sung by Shenaz deserves a special mention. For a first-time director its not a bad fare.There are only three shortcomings in the movie:: 1. The title is not remotely connected to the plot. It should have given an inkling of plot something like misadventures of lost gun, 2. The movie should have been trimmed to give it a punch.3. A few subplots should have been avoided as it made audience lose connectivity." 
" It is a refreshingly well written and directed comedy","What happens when the legendary bumbling Tinkle comic book hero Shikari Shambhu comes to life on big screen? What happens when the lead role of the movie is given to a non-living organism? What happens when the reality of today is mixed with purely illogical comedy? What happens when a mother-of-all-spoofs film tries to be simple, to the point and on your face, and the one-liners have never been heard of in any comedy before? Well, the answer is simple – you get Aagey Se Right.UTV Spotboy continues the tradition of picking up wild directors; this time with Indrajit Nattoji who comes up with one of the zaniest and more bizarre comedies of 2009. And he succeeds in primarily making the audiences laugh with his first Bollywood outing itself.Dinkar Waghmare (Shreyas Talpade) is a simpleton who would rather play marbles with the village kids than to become a police officer. But due to his overbearing and possessive mother, who has dreams of him going to the police force, he starts off his journey to the police station. However, on the way, his Bajrangbali gun gets stolen. On the other hand, terrorist Balma Rashidul Khairi (Kay Kay Menon) gets shipped from Pakistan to Mumbai to put his plan into action, but loses his heart to a bar dancer Pearl (Shehnaz Treasurywala) and, in true Bollywood ishtyle, gives up his 'profession' for the 'sake of love'. On the whole, should one go for Aagey Se Right? The answer is YES! It is a refreshingly well written and directed comedy, with a lot of predictably unpredictable situations, full of spoofy humor, and powerhouse performances by the trio of Shreyas Talpade, Kay Kay Menon and Vijay Maurya. Sonia Bhatt (Mahie Gill) suits the role as the zany, bizarre SMS-us-yes-or-no reporter to the T, though people might not appreciate her in this one, as comparisons might arise to her eclectic performances in Dev.D and Gulaal.Special mention must be given to Nattoji for writing out her role so hilariously that one starts to laugh whenever she utters either 'SMS' or '420420'. Shehnaz Treasurywala looks pretty and acts fine, though she isn't given much of a role to display her acting prowess in particular (she has an infectious smile though). Shruti Seth as the Mother-India-wrist-on-forehead-type-Juliet hams, but her role is to ham, due to the simple fact that she plays this person who overacts with each situation. Shiv Pandit plays well, but his role isn't written well enough. But the best supporting role is that of Shreyas' mom, Bharti Achrekar.The movie has its own share of plus points and flaws. Let's start with the flaws:  The first half does not take off, and one wonders if it's the right movie. Even the comedy in the first half doesn't strike you as funny. Editing in some places is choppy. The movie becomes slightly problematic with too many characters being packed in; something which might irritate as well as annoy some people who were expecting a simplistic comedy that doesn't tax their brains. All this results in many thinking that the movie goes directionless after a point.That being said, the plus points are many:  I've never seen such an elaborately well made title sequence in Bollywood since ages. The movie boasts of a well-layered storyline, which the movie enthusiasts will notice. The director has written in some hilariously unique one-liners that will leave you in splits throughout. Also, the humor is not forced down into your mouth. It is around. People who pick it up will laugh a lot. The music is well placed and adds to the funny quotient. Watch out for 'Maahiya', in which Shreyas does the monkey-dance, as well as 'Love Flashback'. But the song that stands out is the more subtle 'More Piya', which shows the beautiful chemistry of Menon and Treasurywala in a nice and simple way. The only disappointing picturization turns out to be that of 'Daav Laga'. Period. The spoof of Bollywood's habit of remaking Hollywood movies is well placed, though in this context, it is the Bhojpuri industry in picture here. The Bhojpuri adaptation of Spiderman (called Makadman) makes you laugh.Technically, the movie is nothing much to speak about, though the motion graphics used in the title sequence and the end-credits, as well as in the interval card, are worth mentioning.Writing is crisp, and could have been tighter for the first half, which apparently drags on and on till the interval point, because there is extra focus on the characters, something which should not be included in a movie such as this one. Subtle politically and morally correct messages are encrypted into the movie, with the inclusion of the likes of 'love can change even the hardest of hearts' and 'a guy with a good intention is always helped by God', as also 'God never does wrong to any being', something which is directly denoted by the Hanuman sticker on the gun. However, they might never be noticed due to the fact that Nattoji's writing never gives the viewer any time to breathe – at least in the second half.With everything said, the consensus is – let us welcome yet another promising writer-director in Bollywood, Indrajit Nattoji, and hope that his next outing will be far better than this debut outing. In short, watch it for Shreyas Talpade, Kay Kay Menon, Vijay Maurya, or the whacky journey of Waghmare's Bajrangbali gun! Reviewed by: Ankit Ojha www.planetbollywood.com" 
" The posters are far better than the movie","An idea which may sound interesting in a story sitting with the producers needs to be conceptualized and shot in an equally interesting style. But many times we have seen this going the wrong way, which exactly is the problem with "Aagey Se Right". With a one line thick story thought and a terrible messy screenplay the movie doesn't deserve to be called a comedy.A newly appointed Cop loses his service revolver right in the start and then keeps on moving from one situation to another in search of his lost property. Along with this, there is another angle of a Jihadi terrorist falling in love with a young girl, looking for a break in the show business. The promising idea which may have worked in a 90 min English movie gets completely wasted in the Bollywood style project. The reason being that we are still forced to add more additional sub-plots and unwanted songs into the screenplay which actually spoils a good thought and results in an unpleasant clutter.Had it been only these two plots moving into each other, the movie could have been an engrossing flick. But the overcrowded characters running with their own parallel story lines didn't work out at all leading to a complete disaster. The director along with his talented star cast tries desperately hard to make you laugh, but there are actually only few scenes in the movie where you can even smile effortlessly. The screenplay keeps wandering like a lost car on a road moving left and right without any specific directions to go.With Kay Kay & Shreyas Talpade being there in the cast, the movie was expected to be at least a watchable attempt for once. But surprisingly, even they are unable to perform in their unexciting and loosely scattered scenes written uninterestingly. Kay Kay seems to be miscast and Shreyas fails to create any laughter with his innocent attempts. In fact there is only one person, who proves his comic timing once again and he is Vijay Maurya, the Mumbai underworld link of the terrorists. He is really amusing in his few scenes along with Kay Kay. Among the ladies, Shehnaz Treasurywala is simply there because of her pretty face and I really don't know what was Mahi Gill doing in this movie after her impressive performances in "Dev-D" & "Gulaal". It was clearly a wrong choice made in an important phase of her career. Shiv Pandit & Shruti Seth don't impress, but the veterans Rakesh Bedi and Bharti Achrekar excel in their small parts.Musically, the movie has nothing to offer great and same can be said about its Cinematography and Background Score. Editing is unimpressive as it leaves many loose ends remaining unexplained. The movie should have been edited more severely removing all the non essential scenes like that of Shreyas mother coming again & again into the narration.Director Indrajit Nattoji has surely made this movie with good intentions, keeping it clean and tidy for the family audiences. But he couldn't deliver a highly enjoyable comedy despite of having the support of a big production house. However the biggest positive point I see in these small budget experimental types of movies is that they provide an opportunity to many budding technicians, music directors and lyricists who want to prove themselves in the industry. But in case of "Aagey Se Right", its posters are far better than the movie, so you can easily give it a miss." 
" This is a bad movie","Aagey Se Right, directed by first-timer Indrajit Nattoji, is a comedy of errors involving a reluctant sub-inspector Dinkar Waghmare (played by Shreyas Talpade) who loses his revolver accidentally, and while searching for it finds himself sucked into crazy situations with criminals and cops alike. There's a parallel track involving a terrorist named Jaanu, also known as Balma Rashidul Khairi (played by Kay Kay Menon) who arrives in Mumbai on a mission to blow up a Police Day function, but ends up falling in love with a pretty starlet. Throw in a bunch of supporting characters into this mix, add some juvenile humour, and what you have is an occasionally comical chase movie where a series of coincidences take the screenplay forward to its predictable, limp climax. There's a hilarious angle in which a local South Indian don (played by the excellent Vijay Maurya) teaches Kay Kay's Urdu-spouting terrorist how to speak tapori slang so he can woo his lady love. Those bits are the some of the best in the film for the crackling tone in which both actors perform their scenes. Shreyas Talpade is also in fine form despite the limited material, delivering a bag of laughs with his manic timing. The film has some sparky dialogue but in the end it's just an average watch because it feels more like a never-ending stream of jokes and witty one-liners than a film with an actual plot. It's the kind of film you'll have no memory of, 20 minutes after you've left the cinema."
