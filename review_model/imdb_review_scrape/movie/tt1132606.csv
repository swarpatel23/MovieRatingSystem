" Very ugly indeed...","A rip-off of a successful Korean film. I never really understood why certain filmmakers in India have to copy others' films. I do enjoy the occasional films of this category though as long as they are made in their own special way, as long as the elements are somehow changed and the only thing that remains is the basic plot elements, and as long as the film is generally well-made and entertaining. This film has none of it. They put two actors in one piece of a very very boring joke. The film has a Ranvir Shorey, who is generally considered a good actor, hamming and acting like a kid, and a Mallika Sherawat, whom I personally like very much, trying to be cool without success. Nothing about this film is memorable, though I really liked the scenes in which Mallika slaps Ranvir. The film is badly made, the narrative does not go anywhere, the development is dull, and the director seems to have no interest in it. In one word: avoid. In two words: avoid it. In three words: don't watch it." 
" Horrible","I've never seen such a terrible movie as this one in my whole life. 23 years and haven't seen nothing like it. How low can you go to copy someone's movie frame by frame??, how dumb can u be?. Perhaps the director thought ooh "my sassy girl" is a Korean movie so not much people must have seen it, i'll make my copy and take it to the Oscar. crap ????. Who haven't seen my sassy girl?, probably 1/4 of all people in the universe. I think bollywood should change it's name to HollyCopy or "hollyXerox" cause most of it's movies are Hollywood copies. but this one takes the cake, the director did't bother to use his head and shamelessly copied someone's work. He did't change a thing, can u imagine?. If it was an examination he would have copied even the name, Idiot!!!" 
" An Ugly Ripoff","'Ugly Aur Pagli' shamelessly rips off one of my favourite romantic comedies 'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' a.k.a. 'My Sassy Girl'. Not only is the plot hackneyed (and severely underdeveloped), the beauty, subtlety, poetry, sincerity and heart is replaced by toilet humour, non-funny jokes (yes, even the translated dialogues sound ridiculous), loudness, and mild vulgarity. These pathetic makers obviously have no respect for the original. The songs are visualized like those sleazy MTV music videos popping out of nowhere. Music director Anu Malik makes a come back when he was better off in 'exile'. His ghastly score is much worse than his pathetic voice. Ranvir Shorey hams his way through the film. I don't understand why a talented actor like him, who delivered one of the year's finest performances in 'Mithya' chose to be a part of this piece of trash. Mallika Sherawat does not convince at all. Nor does anyone else in the movie. Zeenat Aman's cameo is laughable which is quite a pity as one would have expected something better since we don't get to see her enough these days. This is one movie that should and deserves to be avoided at all costs. Trust me, you're better off watching almost anything else." 
" An experiment on a borrowed thesis.","Pritish Nandy Productions comes with another experimental movie after its "Pyar Ke Side Effects". But this time the experiment has been done on a borrowed thesis. The film is a loosely inspired from a korean movie "Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo" or "My Sassy Girl" (2001) which was then remade in English in 2008.The story  no there is no story but it's a collection of anecdotes about the meetings between a boy and a girl. Its how the boy is rudely shaken and ill treated by her girl friend and then he keeps on trying to cope up with this strange relationship. The director couldn't catch the right spirit of the movie with no particular scene worth talking about.Ranvir Shorey underplays his role but as he doest get any support from the script department therefore fails to impress his fans. He gets very few funny scenes to satisfy the viewer. On the other hand Mallika Sherawat acts pricey and pretends to be the top most actress. She is surely the most sought after actress in one sense but strangely her enigma failed to bring in the crowd this time.Musically film has very less to register with one song becoming famous due to its cheap lyrics, "Main Talli Ho Gayi". Here Poetry takes the back seat once again in recent times. In today's competitive world of young music directors Anu Malik will have to rediscover himself once again.The promos were innovatively planned with good tag lines but the movie is another example of good promotion but bad content. Seeing some recent flicks its time the makers should concentrate more on the movie and its ingredients rather than on its promotional tactics. No doubt, good promotion is a must but you should not fool the audiences with wrong and misleading promos." 
" Ohhh..... God.",""It was senseless."Well, Mallika would have accepted the script 'cause she is kind of "Girls are better than Boys" kind of person, but Ranvir ????? I wonder why he signed it.There were certain emotional moments that couldn't make me empathize (with Mallika mostly).There was a scene about birthday present; now, even the world's most silliest girl wouldn't do that nor even the boy would be so silly. Less comedy, or should I say only two-three situations/lines were good.Well, I feel like my money wasted, buying a ticket. Rather change your TV channel if it is aired. Buying A DVD?? Out of question.I was sheerly disappointed 'cause I liked "Pyaar ke side-effects". The only good thing was Ranvir's acting." 
" Yet another inspired flick! And, oh, what sadomasochism!","Okay, how many of you actually fancy having an unbridled shrew to romance, that too being a doormat? This movie has one hapless Kabir (Ranvir Shorey) who seems to rather enjoy taking that from a drunken Kuhu (Mallika Sherawat). If you thought this idea of sadomasochism was desi, nope, this one is a complete rip-off of Korean ‘My Sassy Girl’; since I hadn’t seen the original, I had to make do by reading the plot on web.An out of romantic luck, flunking engineering student Kabir happens to find a ‘talli’ Kuhu leaning towards an oncoming Mumbai local on one fateful night. The swaying girl pukes over a passenger, calls Kabir ‘darling’ and gets knocked out. Unwilling to leave her to her fate in the dead of the night, Kabir takes her to a shady motel. Next morning, Kuhu commands him to come to Marine Drive, beginning their sadomasochistic romance.As much as he tries to avoid the dominatrix, she always seems to get him. Imagine, the guy can’t order the food he wants, choose what to do, bear the abuse, wear stilettos and petticoats, takes slaps, and has to carry her to safety after her knockout. Funnier still are her futuristic scripts that he’s got to sell to producers! But, having already fallen for her; Kabir makes up his mind to put a smile on the face of her sad past! The rest is workable.Ugly Aur Pagli is neither a sweet romance nor is a comedy you can relate to unlike its predecessor Pyar Ke Side Effects. About Kuhu, I wish the film makers could have done more to bring out the cause of her sadness, than just seemingly fake nakhre. Despite this, Mallika stands out throughout. Playing the doormat to perfection, Ranvir Shorey seems to have perfected playing the whipping boy, especially after ‘Mithya’.If you are still wondering whether to watch this movie, the answer is a clear ‘No’. With characters not really developing much, you don’t feel for either! There are quite a few jokes you would laugh at, but none really are showstoppers. Music is passable, with the ‘talli’ song targeting gen-next drinkers, but isn’t still good enough. At the end of it all, if they made this film out of another DVD, they could have surely done better." 
" That is how we kill the classic!!","well,to start off,I say--TO COPY SOME1'S LITERARY WORK WITHOUT PERMISSION IS A CRIME(PLAGIARISM),BUT TO COPY IT PATHETICALLY IS A SIN"!!Another famous proverb in Hindi says--NAKAL BHI AKAL KE SAATH BAJTI HAI (It requires brains to copy well)To start off,this film is a scene-to-scene,dialogue-to-dialogue rip of Yeopgijeogin geunyeo(2001).Now why do Hindi film makers have to copy foreign/regional films,is what I fail to comprehend.Its simply because of the fact that they fail to invest in the core of any film,that is a story.They pick up a hit plot & plagiarize it.I would appreciate this practice if a copyright licence is obtained.(even though BUM BUM BOLE wasn't well made,yet it was an official remake of Children of heaven(Iranian movie))Anyways,coming back to Ugly aur Ugly...oops,I mean Ugly aur Pagli,its 1 contrived effort which infuriates you through its awkwardness.The director simply copies the scenes without even making the slightest attempt to modify them according to Indian tastes.oh I'm sorry,he does actually,like changing the location of shoe exchange scene from college campus to beach.the amusement park scene from the original shifts to a roof top & Left foot-right foot game scene is shot in a mall.More importantly,the director misses the undertones which are most beautifully depicted in the 2001 Korean movie.Why does Tae Hyun Cha(Gyeon Woo/Kyun Woo) stand upon the yellow line in metro station??(watch the film)).Why does The Girl(Gianna Jun)ask Tae Hyun Cha whether he can swim??(watch the movie).Now you can plagiarize scenes but not the undertones & emotions thus leaving the viewer irritated as Ugly aur Pagli is devoid of such artistry.May be the director of Mallika-Shorey starrer himself failed to comprehend the deep meanings,undertones & layers of emotions conveyed.He just re shot the scenes without much thought process involved.May be he needs to watch Yeopgijeogin geunyeo again (& again & again & again........)to realize what blunder he has made.He just touches the topic superficially without understanding how multi layered the Korean movie was.Even the Unintentionally comic scripts Gianna Jun wrote in the film conveyed a lot about her state of mind(which is disclosed in the climax in a subtle way,I won't tell).Neither could Mallika match the brilliance of Gianna in this bizarre role nor could Shorey generate sympathy for himself as Tae Hyun Cha's innocence does.(even though Shorey is a fine actor but script is so flawed,his attempt fails)Background score helps melodramatic scenes portray better.In Ugly aur Pagli,the music & background score score nothing(though Talli song is a saving grace).While in 2001 korean film,the Piano pieces used as background score arein perfect sync with the mood of the film,thus carrying forward the narrative.The song "I BELIEVE",whenever played,moves you.(especially when Hyun Cha sits on escalator stairs helplessly at metro station with Gianna Jun searching him).The comedy scenes in ugly aur pagli are boring & evoke no interest whatsoever.In fact,so poorly executed,you will feel boredom in all those scenes.In the end,after reading this review,you all might be saying that I've drawn a lot of parallels between the 2 films,but can't help it.Its just like Watching a shawshank redemption or a dark knight on pirated disc having watched it on BLU RAY earlier!!Trust me,neither is this Ugly & Pagli watchable nor the English remake(2008)(Though Cuthbert is a fine actress).Watch this innocent romcom in korean instead & fall the Love!!" 
" Truly "Ugly aur Pagli" movie","What were the makers of this movie thinking. They thought they could give an Indian touch to the Korean original "Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo" which is a masterpiece by itself. Though I do not understand Korean, I watched the Korean version (with English subtitles) and was touched by every moment in it. A friend of mine suggested this movie and I thought it must be some kind of Korean comedy (with animated expressions). But the end result was totally different. It turned out to be a heart rendering, natural comedy with touching moments and a warm ending. Haven't seen the Hollywood version "My Sassy Girl" but the original is special and probably no remake could recreate the magic of the movie. Ugly aur Pagli is an utter failure in an attempt to do so. Instead the comedy is slapstick and makes no sense in the Indian context. Ranvir has been wasted here and Malika should stick to what she does best (which is not acting). Music has nothing to it, except for probably "Main Talli Ho Gayi". Overall the movie makes a mockery of the original and has nothing much to take back from it." 
" A bad copy of a beautiful movie","I knew that this movie is a copy of the Korean movie "MY SASSY GIRL"/(Yeopgijeogin geunyeo), but then also I went and watched it to see what Indian actors and directors had come up with. And the result was pathetic!. This movie sucks big time. People who have not seen "MY SASSY GIRL" would find this movie as a 'time pass movie'. Mallika Sherawat is not fit for such a role and since the whole movie is based on the girl character, the movie is a waste of time and money. I would suggest you to watch "MY SASSY GIRL" which is a 50 times better than this movie. If you have nothing else to do and no other movie to watch then only think of watching this one. Instead of taking inspiration from "MY SASSY GIRL" they made a complete copy of it." 
" Movie is " Ugly aur Pugli"","At the cost of being called stupid let me confess, I had Hopes!!!.Not very high hopes but I expected a movie along the lines of Pyaar Ke Side Effects, I even went prepared with the right company (girls), in fact i even hoped a bit more considering that Ranvir should be able to pull of the hen pecked boyfriend better than Rahul.But alas it was not to be.What i got was more of a confused film that went neither here nor there and left me with that Ugly feeling of being let down.Clearly the weakest part of the movie is the script, Even if we are to believe that a bunch of 30 somethings are in college (better than the 70s i know but...), its hard to believe the madness thats being pushed across as real, THE MOVIE FAILS AT BOTH TRYING TO BE REAL AND LARGER THAN LIFE WITH BOTH TYPES OF SCENES HAVING THE HANGOVER OF THE OTHER.THE MUSIC SAVE FOR "Mein Talli.." IS SO BAD THAT YOU ALMOST FORGET THE EVEN WORST PLACEMENT AND EDITING OF THE SONGS.And whats with the sati savitri Mallika in her own words, we don't come to see her fully clothed, hell besides one song where she looked quite sexy (which was ruined because the songs were just so pathetic), she didn't even expose in goa for gods sake.The only saving grace of the movie was the acting which was decent given the weak script, both Ranvir and Mallika did a decent job but thanks to the badly written script, many scenes looked like they were being hammed. And lets be frank Ranvir cant dance sala, so why is he doing it so much.I suspect the movie has been copied from some movie because of the scenes were not the kind you normally see in Indian movies. In fact i would like to go on a limb and say it is some Asian movie, who are more atuned to obsessive love and such themes.In all we have a poor movie that is best avoided, not suitable for any audience, in any mood.-s script, songs, jokes, editing, songs, songs, editing, script.+/-s acting or script which is to blamed??!!No exposure.+s decent acting, A FEW FUNNY SCENES.total 4/10 (i have factored in the fact that it fell below my expectations but don't want to exclude that and give it a five which makes it an OK movie which it definitely is not, i went with people who expected bad and the got it and those who had no idea they were seeing this and still found it bad so....)" 
" you want my honest opinion?","Well, there are many kinds of movies. Some of them are outstanding, some are great, some good, some bad, some terrible and then there's something like Ugly Aur Pagli. We landed up getting tickets to the premier show before the official launch in theaters. For some very, and now unbelievably, stupid reason my friends and I felt privileged to have got tickets for this show. In fact, we missed the first few minutes and I was tempted to ask my seat mate about the scenes I missed.Most of the people laughed not because things were funny, but to feel that their hard-earned money was well-spent. I too laughed sometimes, and I felt guilty every time I did. My strong belief is that the writer lost the plot somewhere in the beginning itself. I didn't have high expectations, but I sure felt deceived. Here are my reasons:(1) It didn't have a story (2) If you argue it did, I would argue back (3) Whatever little there was to it, was held intact because of Ranveer (4) I will not deduct marks for a predictable ending. That's a disease faced by most movies. I would never look down upon someone's creative work, but I would feel even more guilty if many people spent good money, time and popcorn on something like this. My honest opinion, and what I strongly believe to be a fact, is that you should avoid watching this well-rhyming movie.Avoid the temptation of a great trailer." 
" you will only understand this movie if you have ever been in love","First of all i would like to start with saying that it is a very good movie. I know it is inspired by a Korean movie, but the Indian touch given is awesome. I went to watch this movie only because i am a fan of Ranvir and liked nearly all his movies like mixed doubles, mithya(one of his best), etc. To no surprise, ranvir was way too good. He is a natural actor and really made the movie worth watching. His face reactions were very good and malika wasn't that bad. But to some point i think she didn't pull the role that good. I went with my 3 friends and only i enjoyed the movie. If you have loved before or are in love then you will really understand how it feels. So go and enjoy the film." 
" a good romantic and comedy love story..superb!!","ugly and pagli, inspired from Korean super-hit movie "MY SASSY GIRL" in which actress "jeon ji-hyun" had performed a marvelous performance. Based on a series of true stories posted by Ho-sik Kim on the Internet describing his relationship with his girlfriend. These were later transformed into a best-selling book and the movie follows the book closely. In My Sassy Girl, tea hyun-cha(hero) unexpectedly meets jeon ji-hyun (heroin) on a train and which leads to a good friendship and then turns in to a true love between them.. The girl who makes the guy to do all the crazy things is the best part of the movie.. The movie "MY SASSY GIRL" has got a good and strong love story, comedy as well as some moments which make the audience cry.Its a must watch movie for the people who is in love and want to maintain them perfectly and for those who is waiting to be in a relation. hope " ugly and pagly" will also make a box office hit!!" 
" a really ugly movie remake","how can they ruin such a beautiful loving and my all time favorite romantic comedy.Luckily i watched my sassy girl before the ugly ..."ugly and pagli" what a horrible movie they have made, this Indian film industry cant even copy properly horrible ....i watched this movie for 30 mins and i couldn't bear the insult of on e\e of my favourite movies so i had to stop[.....gyus if you really want to watch a great real life true romantic story go and watch "my sassy girl" the original Korean version with English subtitles ... not the Hollywood remake which is not as bad as bollywood .. but still if you want to watch a masterpiece go and watch my sassy girl you will find in btjunkie torrent" 
" This is an awful comedy","Ugly Aur Pagli is a pretty straightforward lift of the South Korean film My Sassy Girl, which was produced and released eastside seven years ago. I must confess here, I haven't actually seen the original film and chances are you wouldn't have either. You're probably wondering then, how I'm so sure Ugly Aur Pagli is copied from that film. Well, here's what to do. Get on to the Internet, log on to the search engine wikipedia.com, and punch in the title My Sassy Girl. Just read the detailed plot breakdown of the Korean film that comes up and you'll understand exactly why I'm so shocked someone was shameless enough to take story and screenplay credit for this desi remake. Ugly Aur Pagli stars Ranvir Shorey as Kabir, a loveless engineering student whose life changes when he rescues an intoxicated girl at a railway station one night. That seemingly helpless girl Kuhu (played by Mallika Sherawat) turns out to be dominating, opinionated and even sadistic to a point. Over the next few weeks, she more or less takes over Kabir's life, slapping him around at will, ordering him out on dates, deciding what he can and can't order when he's with her, and demanding that he do all sorts of odd things to please her. Convinced she's got a pain inside that's manifesting itself in all these strange ways, Kabir decides to go along with Kuhu's mad demands in the hope of pleasing her and curing her of her pain. But it can't be easy for a guy, can it? Wearing her stilettos and walking down Marine Drive; riding around in a petticoat on a bicycle without a seat; and visiting film producers' offices with her ridiculous screenplays. Ugly Aur Pagli is not your typical romantic comedy in the sense that there's a simmering sadness to the film that is both rare and unique. It's difficult to understand and empathise with Kuhu's sadistic streak because the filmmaker fails to explore her personality well enough to explain this side. Doesn't help of course that Mallika Sherawat isn't the least bit convincing when she's doing drama. Watch her in those emotional scenes and you cringe, because the fakeness in her performance is hard to shake off. She's fantastic at comedy though, and keeps you hooked through the film's lighter moments, aided of course by the tremendously gifted Ranvir Shorey who is unquestionably the star of this film. It takes an extremely intelligent actor to play dumb so well, and Ranvir does it almost effortlessly. In the end, Ugly Aur Pagli doesn't quite work because it's corny and contrived and it tries too hard. For a romantic comedy to work, you have to like the couple enough to want them to end up together, but honestly there's little to like about either Kabir or Kuhu. He's a doormat and she's an overbearing kid. Apart from a few decent jokes, it's unlikely you're going to enjoy this film much. My advice: head to the nearest bar, down a few shots of tequila like Kuhu does in the film, and then go watch this film. Perhaps you'll enjoy it while you're talli (intoxicated) yourself." 
" Give this Ugli and Pugli a skip.....","UnP ran high on anticipation levels since it comes from the same house who gave us Pyar Ke Side Effects. Honestly UnP borrows concepts/ ideas heavily from PKSE and in lots of respects it overkills  which is why the movie fails to work. The story/ screenplay/ script lack the punch.Ranvir Shorey:: Gives his usual best.Mallika Sherwat:: Was a misfit IMO. Or probably her character should have been toned down.Zeenat Aman:: Good to see her after a long time.Songs are catchy and good.The climax is straight out of Mills & Boons (read that "cheesy")."
