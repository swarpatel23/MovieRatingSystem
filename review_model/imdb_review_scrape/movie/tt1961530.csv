" Tell You To Watch Something Else Unless","After more than 15 years, Hema Malini returns to the director's chair (and she assumes a supporting role) to make 'Tell Me O Kkhuda' (what's with this double consonant?). This is also perhaps Esha Deol's comeback or departure film. The plot echoes one of Hema's previous directorial ventures 'Dil Aashna Hai' which itself was a remake of a Hollywood flick. It has nothing fresh to offer as it feels stale, like another family drama for the late 80s/ early 90s except that here the songs are dreadful and they look like awful MTV videos.Even the sequences that could have added some freshness, like the camel race, are poorly executed. The movie has a melodramatic tone. The plots regarding each of the dads are poorly developed, especially the last one (with Dharmendra and Hema Malini).Esha Deol had an authorbacked role but it's not a well written one. She is good in a few sequences, especially the scene where she eavesdrop on her biological father expressing regret, but her overall performance doesn't particularly impress. Farooq Sheikh and Deepti Naval are a delight to watch even with their limited screen time. Rishi Kapoor is passable. Meltem Cumbul is likable. Dharmendra really hams it up while Hema Malini is wooden. It was nice to see Madhoo after years but she doesn't get much scope nor does Arjan Bajwa.At least 'Dil Aashna Hai' offered good performances and has nostalgic value for me. As much as I like Hema Malini and respect what she's tried to do, 'Tell Me O Kkhuda' has nothing fresh to offer." 
" One of the worst movies I saw !","I wonder, after viewing this movie, why actors turn to being directors and producers when they have little or no experience in either. This movie lacks everything,bad story line (no coherent story), terrible acting or rather total lack of it, there comes a time when actors need to retire from the big screen, lousy photography, song sequences had nothing to do with the story line, unnecessary dialogues and useless actors. Hema has proved that one ought not flaunt ones popularity to fans , it is best to leave them with the good memories of your acting days.Watching this movie is a total waste of time ! Why did Hema make such a bad movie is beyond me !!" 
" waiting for this for years...","man was i afraid to watch this movie. I thought that Hema Malini would remake the mini series LACE 2 in which Phoebe Cates tries to find out who her father is. I thought this because Hema her first movie as a director DIL AASHNA HAI was a remake of LACE 1. But i was pleasantly surprised. Esha Deol is adopted by Farooque Sheikh and Deepti Naval and tries to find out who her father is Vinod Khanna, Risshi Kapoor or Dharmendra... Esha Deol gives a good performance, one of her best so far, Vinod Khanna is okay, Rishi Kapoor is okay (I am a big Rishi fan, but this is not one of his best movies). They did this movie specially for Hema Malini. But the best part of this movie? Man that is seeing one of the greatest team ever to hit Bollywood together again on screen. I mean Dharmendra and Hema Malini. Seeing them brings back memories of all those classic films. They are a bit older but the chemistry and charm is still there. I hope they do make another movie together"
