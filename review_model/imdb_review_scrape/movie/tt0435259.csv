" This is a comedy?","If JDMGRH was crap, Mahesh again returns with a comedy PADMASHREE LALOO PRASAD YADAV No this isn't a take off on him or a spoof on him It's the names of the main characters in the filmMahesh gave us some of the best films in drama like VAASTAV, ASTITVA even VIRUDDH was decent but his comedies are the worst everThis film proves yet again that he shouldn't touch comedies either as an actor or directorThe film is a remake of A FISH CALLED WANDA A decent plot for a comedy but badly handled The comedy is cringeworthyIn short The film is a badly made comedy The film has Suneil passing gay gestures to Johny Lever it was funny in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA(again having Johny at the receiving end) here it is terrible It has Masumeh who for diamonds tries to attract Mahesh Manjerekar Enough saidIt also has Laloo Prasad Yadav making an appearance in the end and perhaps the last scene wasn't complete or Suneil wasn't present for the shoot or perhaps he was bored of the film Because it clearly shows someone else facing his back towards us trying to pass off as Suneil covering his faceDirection by Mahesh is terrible Music is badSuneil Shetty looks cool and is okay in his part Masumeh hams it up Johny Lever annoys, Mahesh Manjerekar after JAWANI DIWANI proves yet again he is an annoying comedian Sharat Saxena is bad" 
" Timepass","What can I say? Here comes another dullard movie with nothing great to offer. The jokes aren't extremely great, the plot is incredibly predictable, the story is old, and the actors are mediocre. This is your typical Bollywood-style, "masala-filled" movie, which I admit is good to relax to after a long week. If you leave your brain at home for this film, you might just be able to tolerate it. You've got the glamorous girls, the high crimes, and of course, you can't forget about Johnny Lever's comedy, as trite as it may be. Nonetheless, it gets boring very quickly. At the end of it all, you come out telling yourself, "I can't believe I subjected myself to such stupidity." To keep consistent with the quality of cinema you're watching, the songs are also pretty lame." 
" hilarious 1","hilarious one I thought it would be a bore but it turned out to be a great entertainer south African scenes were chosen well suneil was great so was Masumi Makhija, but kudos to all the actors including the director/actor Mahesh Manjrekar they were so natural in all their roles, Johnny Lever,Gulshan Grover,Sharat Saxena were all hilarious. Kim Sharma was her usual beautiful self keep it up wish we could get more of such movies i am so sad it did not do too well at the box office. It was good to see shashikala after so many years. hey suneil & mahesh you are both such naturals at comedy, you should be doing so many more of such roles, mahesh no more of your villainous roles please, they r kind of pathetic, again it is up to you, wish you all the best."
