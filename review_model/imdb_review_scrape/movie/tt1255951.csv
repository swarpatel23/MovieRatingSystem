" This film is for smart people, and it is under-rated.","i am surprised that this film has such a low rating. I am rating it a 9.It has lots of famous Indian actors in it, and everyone is very funny in it.The reason why it has a low rating, it is probably because every character in it is connected to others one way or another. So if you don't pay attention to who they are, what they did, you will quickly get lost. If you can't understand who they are, then obviously you will lost interest very quickly.that is why i say in order to appreciate this comedy, you have to be an intelligent person. it is not for common people who have short attention span.Of course, what happened in the film is improbable in real life. It is just a fun entertaining comedy, you will laugh for sure." 
" Better Watch Screwed","The movie was cool and Paresh and Johnny lever are the best out of all the characters in the movie! The movie is a copy of Screwed. DE DANA DAN has so many characters that it gets difficult to pinpoint or single out any one actor. Akshay and Katrina are completely misused. Paresh is fine with his loud voice. Katrina and Sameera don't have much to do. Amongst the actors, Johny Lever, Neha Dhupia, Manoj Joshi, Asrani, Vikram Gokhale and Archana Puransingh deserve special mention. DE DANA DAN is targeted to make to laugh nd it delivers it in abundance. You have to leave your brains behind to enjoy this Priyadarshan flick! But also watch Screwed to compare which one is better, "Priyadarshan" OR " Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski:" 
" Bang Bang Bang Laugh Riot!!!","With the team joins hands back again, the expectations are nothing short of yet another "Hera Pheri". The team needed a desperate hit to redeem themselves from the recent spate of flops in everybody's kitty. Needless to say the pressure surmounts and result is "De Dana Dan". De Dana Dan gives the opportunity to see all the Priyan's regulars under one roof. There is little something for everybody and to what extent the character is justified is a debate for another day. The laugh-riot owing to comedy of errors bear uncanny resemblance to Priyan's earlier outing "Hungama". There are streaks of "One Two Three" (under-rated, IMO). The writer should be applauded for being able to weave the intricate complex mesh of sub-plots and integrate it into the main storyline. On the same note, the director deserves brownie points for being able to cross the deliverable milestone. No doubt there is breadth in terms of sub-plots, however the downside is lack of depth in it. By the time a character and the sub-plot sinks into the audience, the story moves on. And when the tributaries join in, the confusion starts to seep in. In terms of performance the lead performers are do a fine job ie. Akki, Paresh, Suniel, Katrina in descending order of of screen time. Sameera Reddy hardly leaves an impression. The supporting cast as mentioned earlier are Priyan's regulars and seem under-utilised. But hey-ho, everybody seemed to have enjoyed the overseas holiday during the shoot. On that note, it seems basing the story in Malaysia was an overkill. Lets not forget "Hera Pheri" worked because of the simplicity which the audience were instantly able to connect. Pritam's songs deserve a special mention, great foot-tapping numbers are justified adequately with their picturisation. Finally Priyan could have come up with a better climax rather the water- shed." 
" Great Entertainer","The movie was hilarious and Akki Suniel Paresh and Johnny lever are the best out of all the characters in the movie! The movie will probably be big hit. DE DANA DAN has so many characters that it gets difficult to pinpoint or single out any one actor. Akshay is at his best in a Priyadarshan film and DE DANA DAN proves it. Suniel is natural to the core. Paresh is incredible; he pitches in a superb act. Katrina and Sameera don't have much to do. Amongst the plethora of actors, Johny Lever, Neha Dhupia, Manoj Joshi, Asrani, Vikram Gokhale and Archana Puransingh deserve special mention. DE DANA DAN is targeted at the masses and it delivers laughter in abundance. Leave your brains behind to enjoy this madcap entertainer!" 
" Damn funny! Go watch it!","De Dana Dan is one of the finest comedies in recent times, we all know Priyadarshan is an expert on the field of comedy, this movie belongs to his top movies next to Hera Pheri, Hungama and Garam Masala.The movie started off on a hilarious note, continued to the climax in a hilarious way, and ended in a perfect typical Priyadarshan way! I always liked Sunil Shetty and know he is very underrated, Akshay Kumar and Sunil were both outstanding, and delivered rib-tickling performances.The supporting cast is excellent, Paresh Rawal, Asrani, Johnny Lever, Shakti Kapoor, Neha Dhupia, Sharat Saxena.. everyone! Katrina Kaif and Sameera Reddy didn't really have much scope, or funny scenes..Plusses : Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Johnny Lever, REALLY funny moments and a few nice songs.Minus : The songs pop out of nowhere, but we are kind of used to that with Priyadarshan aren't we? Go for it, you won't be disappointed!" 
" Great","The movie was hilarious!!! everyone in the theatre was laughing their heads off! my stomach hurted even after some time! the movie was absolutely mind blowing!!! one of the best ones by PRIYADARSHAN! the acting was superb, screenplay was fantastic, dialogues were exceptionally tremendous, and direction was brilliant!!! the movie was hilarious from the first scene to the last one and promised complete family entertainment throughout! the story was new, dialogues were witty, and the acting was great! the whole cast acted brilliantly!! no overacting, but some parts were loud! unlike most stupid comedy movies now a days where you are laughing at their stupidity more than the movie! this one was a complete roller coaster ride of jokes! songs were really good as well! in short a complete entertainer!!! HATS OFF! Don't do anything this weekend! JUST GO FOR THIS ONE!!! Rating Acting 10/10 Story 9/10 Screenplay 10/10 Dialogues 10/10 Music 8.5/10 Entertainment 100/10 EXCELLENT movie in all aspects!!!" 
" Hilarious slapstick","Most people say this is stupid movie making with no story and a rubbish movie, that is simply not true. This movie does have a story, a smart one at that also. Most people say it doesn't, what were you people doing when the movie was playing its a simple story and a different from all the other comedies we've been seeing.The songs were pretty good even thought they were just chucked in but its PRIYADARSHAN so we know stupid stuff will be happeningPriyadarshan does a good job at directing. There are so many characters in one hotel about 26 and he manages to make them all have a fair part in the movie.The performances were awesome Akshay was fantastic his face expressions to the way he talks is hilarious. Suneil does very good too and makes us laugh. Everybody else does a great job to making it more hilariousIn the end de dana dan is a slapstick comedy that does make you laugh. I don't know what people were expecting that made it a let down. Of course it not 3 idiots but as far as slapstick's go it is funny unlike a lot coming out recently like Rascals. So leave your brains behind and go watch this crazy and hilarious comedy." 
" Very Funny Movie with actual good humor","Ignore the other ratings! I get that some other Hindi comedy movies are so mindless and stupid they are not funny, but this movie is smart, exciting, and hilarious without being overly stupid. I have watched this over 5 times and it does not get old. Akshay Kumar is one of the funniest and most talented actors, and this movie includes many other famous comedy actors. A must see!!" 
" Laughter Hurricane - Brilliant, non-sensical comedy, just leave your brains back home!","Have seen many Priyadarshan movies, but this one was amazing. So many characters, so many and all adding to their bit to have made tears flow out of my eyes laughing. Like all other movies, the central theme to this movie is also CONFUSION but its different. It is different in the way it has been executed, scripted, the way one event has been connected to other, the way one character is linked to other. Sheer brilliance.The first 45 minutes or so are drape, I would now say, setting the foundation for a laughter hurricane, but by the time we enter the second half, you just can't stop but LAUGH and burst out more, LAUGHING. So much so, that you miss many dialogs, amidst the 'surround sound' and echoes of laughter! This movie is based around cash, characters and confusion and hats off to everyone for making it the way they have. I remember laughing as much (or less) last in some scenes during Garam Masala.A movie which has Akshay Kumar, didn't bore you even when Akshay Kumar was locked in a cupboard for appreciable amount of time. In fact, you didn't even realize that he was there. They have made people laugh in otherwise seemingly very ordinary scenes. Comedy out of nothing! And that was just the start, as I have said before, moving in to the second half, you may just slip out of your chair and actually experience 'LMAO'I just loved the movie and would not mind watching it again and maybe again and then probably again and then give it the stature of 'Hera Pheri'. I think it deserves a 9/10 (being conservative), provided you leave your brains at home or maybe that is not required. There isn't enough time to try and use your brains, too many funny scenes lined one after the other.I hope you do go and watch the movie and enjoy it as well." 
" Hilarious","Wow..... real nice movie! I read a few reviews and was real skeptical to watch the movie. Since last 3-4 movies have been huge flops. Exceptional Comedy DDD... is that exceptional Bollywood Comedy where the story, acting, music and photography all come together in a fine symphony. Thankfully, in DDD Akshay Kumar, has amply redeemed himself with a glittering performance. Everyone actor in the movie has done justice to their respective roles. You all have to go out there and watch this movie. All the people in the theater were laughing out loud ha ha Its a must watch. I will go and watch it again. But make sure you folks see it in a theater." 
" Excellent Comedy !!!!!!!","It is a priyadarshan comedy so it is obvious that there is no need to carry your brains along.the story is simple.Nitin Bankar (Akshay Kumar) is a personal butler, cook, driver, watchman, gardener to a wealthy female industrialist (Archana Puran Singh) in Singapore. Like any young man, Nitin too, dreams of a better life, but misfortune is his constant companion and his reality is his job under Archana. He desperately wants to become rich and marry the love of his life, Anjali Kakkad (Katrina Kaif), who supports him financially.Ram Mishra (Suneil Shetty), Nitin's best friend also came to Singapore with the dream of striking it rich, but ended up a courier delivery man. He falls for Manpreet Oberoi (Sameera Reddy), but her high society parents will never approve of marriage, not unless Ram has lots and lots of money.In the midst of all this, is Harbans Chadda (Paresh Rawal), a shrewd businessman, is looking for ways to multiply his income and avoid his debtors. He decides the best way would be to marry his son off to a girl whose parents can give him a large dowry. He is introduced to Manpreet's parents at a Diwali function and is impressed by their social status. He introduces himself as a well-established businessman, impresses them and they decide to get Manpreet and Harbans' son (Chunky Pandey) married.With several factors working against them, Nitin and Ram soon reach a dead end in their relationships. When both receive ultimatums from their girlfriends, they realize that only a life of vice can help them out of their misery. They come up with an audacious plan to kidnap someone important and demand a ransom. The kidnapping goes well, and both hide out at a local hotel while waiting for the ransom money. But misfortune is never far, and the kidnapping spirals out of control.Meanwhile, Manpreet's wedding reception is being held at the same hotel that Nitin and Ram are hiding in. Soon, they are joined by a motley set of characters including a Chinese Don, a hired assassin, a ACB police inspector, a club dancer, an ambassador, a young frustrated double crossing wife, a letch, a drunken waiter, and a dead body nobody wants check into the hotel....What happens next is De Dana Dan...full of many twists and turns that will leave you giddy with laughter...De Dana Dan...full of Masti and Madness!!!it is a fun film from start to end.Akshay kumar is rocking as ever.Sunil Shetty has done a very good job.The scenes between Akshay and Sunil are very good.Paresh Rawal is satisfactory.Johnny lever is excellent.Archana Puran Singh is good.A special mention of Vikram Gokhale as he is awesome,he creates actual humor without being funny.Manoj joshi is good.Rajpal doent have much to do.Katrina and sameera have done a decent job however they do not have much screen presence. I would rate this movie 10/10 just for its entertainment factor. A must watch if you like Mindless comedy !!!!1" 
" Nice flick!","So guys here is the first review of De Dana Dan.Spent 150 bucks for this one and must say was worth it. The movie didn't disappoint me at all. There are many funny moments in the movie.The story is the same one. 2 guys fall in love with 2 rich gals but their father wants them to marry someone other than them. So they decide to get some money. Akshya works in Archana Puran Singh's house as a housemaid and also serves as the driver. to get some money they decide to kidnap the "Dog MOOLCHAND Ji". But everything goes wrong when the dog goes back to mistress.They move to hotel pan pacific where there are other guests including sameera reddy in laws. a lot of confusion goes on.Acting wise i was disappointed by paresh rawal. Akshya and Katrina looks good and even sameera reddy and suniel shetty have done a decent job.So a must watch for all. After all the best this one is the best comedy of this year.my rating - 6/10" 
" Just OK movie","The movie is funny but not in the same league as Hera Pheri. I have seen Priyadarshan's same movie made in Malayalam and found that one funnier. This movie was good in spurts, but overall it was a bit bland. The main reason could be because I felt that not much thought went into the the dialogues; so some of the scenes looked part of an improvisation exercise. Therefore it lacked the necessary punch. The initial song was excellent and so was Neha Dhupia's "Haughty Naughty" number. The trio Akshay, Paresh & Suneil did their usual thing. Suneil was a bit funnier this time. While Katrina, Sameera & Chunky didn't have much to do; they were there just for the ambiance.I found the scenes leading up to the climax good and on a slightly bigger scale than the original movie. The movie could have had a slightly better ending. To rap it up I would say even though it wasn't a rip roaring laugh riot, it is still a good time pass movie." 
" A clumsy act of absurdities.","One simple question to start withIn the current scenario, are we always supposed to see a Bollywood Comedy leaving our thinking brains at home?......Really fed up with this phrase often used to praise mindless comedies, I was completely taken back by the treatment given by Priyadarshan to his latest script-less movie called "De Dana Dan". Once again taking his inspirations from the English flicks, "Screwed" (2000) "Blame It on The Bellboy" (1992) and "The Towering Inferno" (1974), the director delivers a completely over the top and loud movie which miserably fails to impress the viewers in any of its department.With more than 20 characters in the script, played by all well known actors of the Industry, the project has too many things to deal with. It really remains a questionable decision that even after the presence of the famous "Hera Pheri" comic trio, what was the need of roping in almost everyone related to comedy genre in the industry ranging from the veterans Asrani & Shakti Kapoor to the currently famous Johny Lever & Rajpal Yadav. Priyadarshan may have successfully dealt with them all in few of his previous projects but this time he simply slips disastrously.Storyline has never been the major highlight of a Priyadarshan project. But in "De Dana Dan", he very daringly treats the story requirement of a movie in the most careless manner. Starting with few good scenes moving around a Kidnapping plot, the movie starts going into various opposite directions with a desperate plea to make you laugh. Post interval it looks like the director and the whole unit somehow lost their original script in the transit and just went on with the shooting as per their outdoor schedule.After an hour the movie has nothing related to a story and it just has all its characters confusingly following each other with mistaken identities. Collectively living in the same five star hotel, everyone keeps barging into unknown rooms trying to create some hilarious scenes for the viewers. And the most surprising part is that post intermission the biggest star of the movie, Akshay Kumar simply vanishes from the screen for more than half an hour. He gets locked in a closet and remains there for a good amount of time. But what was the use of locking your most sellable star like that. "De Dana Dan" has loads of absurdities in its narration, which fail to convince even if you take them as a part of a brainless comedy flick. For instance, a full grown man (Akshay Kumar) has been kidnapped but the whole Indian community (in Singapore) and the entire media is searching for a kid instead, because that is the only photograph available of the kidnapped person. In the climax the top floor water reservoir of a more than 30 story hotel gets exploded due to a bomb. And that shockingly brings a major flood like situation in the entire multistory building with everything floating in the heavy water flow. In fact the silly watery sequence hilariously resembled the one recently seen in "Tum Mile".Performance wise this is a perfect example of a film with the most numbers of stars, where not even one makes his presence felt in the end. For the first time ever, I found Paresh Rawal, hamming with his intentional Punjabi accent. The viewers are sure going to miss the cult Paresh Rawal act of his previous hit comedies. Akshay Kumar is not entirely there in the movie. He starts off with some good scenes with Archna Puran Singh, but later gets lost in the overcrowded star-cast. Not using him as per his much applauded comic timing is entirely the fault of his director. Suniel Shetty does his act with an unconcerned ease and he seems to be included only to complete the famous comedy trio.Both Katrina Kaif & Sameera Reddy can count their major scenes on one hand. They only contribute in the film as its female lead and nothing else. In comparison, Neha Dhupia makes a better impact in her few moments on the screen. Archana Puran Singh shouts more and acts less. Aditi Gowariker once again proves that she is better model. Shakti Kapoor repeats his sex maniac act. Asrani, Tinnu Anand & Manoj Joshi are routine, but Chunkey Pandey, Rajpal Yadav and Johny Lever are simply wasted in their unimportant roles. Sharat Saxena & Vikram Ghokhle are miscast as they simply do not belong to the comedy genre.Pritam's music is not outstanding as expected. But the RDB track "Paisa Paisa" is a major hit which also has its own history in the Punjabi Music Industry. The track was the opening song of the Debut Album of Manak-E released few years back, which had music by RDB and was also promoted well with a music video on the leading Punjabi channels. It was indeed quite thoughtful of both RDB and Akshay to use the song with the same singer in the promotional campaign of the movie. However as usual, all the songs are inserted in the script without any specific need. Background score by Salim-Suleman is energetic and Cinematography is fine as per the requirement of the subject but the film tends to go over length due to its bizarre climax.On the whole, it's just another instance of better promotion and poor content. Few weeks before, I could understand the success of "Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani" (though I personally rated it quite low) as it had a worth praising act by Ranbir Kapoor, good songs and some hilarious scenes with mass appeal, but if "De Dana Dan" goes on to become a big Hit then I really fear what kind of projects we are going to get in the near future.And lastly one sincere request for the director, who gave us the cult "Hera Pheri"..Please take a break and re-invent yourself on priority basis!" 
" Amazing... movie. Funiest Movie of this year 2009","Its full of Gags for word go. You will continuously laugh out loud from the word go for 2.45 hrs. Story is quite similar to normal Priyadarshan type Hera Peri in the movie that will grip you to seats till end and roll you all over laughing. Ease your tension and enjoy ! Though I missed Akki in latter half. :( Music is not good. But two songs Pisa Pisa and U and I are mesmerizing. All n all this is the best movie of this year. If you like movie like APKGK then this one will take you off the seats. Akshay is at its best. And whole gang of all the actors have performed amazing well. Especially Jonny. GO and Have FUN. :)" 
" Not that Great......Has it's funny moments but......","Alright when i first went to see this movie it was a full house in the theatre and i could not get a ticket and instead i watched kurbaan but since de dana dan had a full house it increased my expectations for the movie and then when i went to see it the next week..........Disappointment, seriously i was expecting this to be a quality movie after reading the reviews but what happened.It isn't a Kambakht Ishq but still it could be close because it gets a little stupid and did i mention at one point i was not even able to follow the story line because it got so confusing but then the reason it isn't a kambakht ishq is because first of all it isn't entirely stupid and it does have it's funny moments and overall it really is not a must watch but if you have nothing else to do i guess go watch it."
