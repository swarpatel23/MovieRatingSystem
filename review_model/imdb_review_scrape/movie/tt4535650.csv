" Bullsh*t movie that should be renamed as CARS","The script for this was written by a 6 year old who watched too many Hollywood. That is the only way I can interpret this movie. More that half of this movie is CARS and then some Michael Bay sh*t. The song locations or songs not make any sense.I like SRK and Kajol as couple but I never expected that they will act in such a movie. Even half the dialogs were reference to other movies. The action scenes were too short for enjoyment. If you go too deep in movie for logic (I always do because I want good logic in a good movie) then you will bang your head against the wall.My conclusion is that if you are looking to waste 2h 38m of your time and to see the return of SRK and Kajol jodi then go watch the film. But if you're looking for a good story or at least a logical film then really don't waste your money or your time. Thank you!" 
" Majority of the 10* reviews are fake fake fake!","It is hilarious to see the first 4 pages of reviews of Dilwale has a 10* rating which was rather surprising to me. So I go in to the profile of each of those people and there you have it most of the reviewers had joined IMDb in Dec and this is the only movie they have rated.It is just sad when movie makers have to create fake profiles and rate the movie high so the public would fall for it and watch the movie. But this is such a sad strategy as we can not be fooled for long.I wanted to check the reviews first before watching the movie but thankfully the real reviews from real people have told me exactly what i needed to know!" 
" Just as I expected....same old clich√©d film.","The movie is exactly what I thought it would be. Overrated because of fans of the SRK-Kajol Jodi. I don't understand why the audience of Bollywood never appreciates good stories and great direction. Instead, they go for movies that contain the same old overrated Bollywood actors and actresses. A romantic song with a dance across the beautiful landscapes around the world does not make for a beautiful movie.Don't even get me started on the overacting. I expected at least some decent acting from the two experienced actors in this movie about whom the fans were going crazy for the past few weeks. But no. Acting? What is that? Let's just dance around the world and add some stunts and we'll earn 100+ crores.I'm eagerly waiting for the day when SRK will go back to making movies like Swades and Chak De India." 
" Why SRK??","what is wrong with SRK what happened to his picks this time he has crossed all the limits never thought this much pathetic stuff even Hny looks like a masterpiece which was pathetic too,the writer is the most lazy person and so lame he is so lazy that he forget to write the story but how could even someone say yes to this movie and that too if he is SRK,Is Rohit Shetty done a black magic on him even action wise he failed horribly and screenplay was the worst part everything was expected because of the glimpse of the flashback coming and it was not even worth it and trust me i am one of the biggest fan of Srk and if i am saying so bad against him then there is almost everything wrong with this movie shame on Srk and Kajol for doing this movie and put down th expectation of people please don't ever do Masala film again the talent that you have is unmatchable don't destroy by making this type of crappiest stuff do only intense serious films fan and Raees looks good though and not me every universe want you to see in a quality movie please think before you sign any project specially avoid Farah Khan Rohit Shetty this two are the biggest upset of your career in last few years world is cruel there is already so much negativity against you only way to stop them is by making good stuff they will shut there mouth but how will it happen if you continue to this type of stuff only 2 stars i have given just because some comedy and beautiful songs dilwale is total zero otherwise i am very sad writing all this but this is the epic disaster of all time." 
" Dilwale ...... mix of bad dialouges and bad acting","Why did Rohit Shetty did this ? In case of Chennai Express at least there was story running along railway track but this is like Kumbh mela !! Story is running in all directions.Bad, very bad comedy !! You have to force yourself to laugh.Director is trying hard to make humor but not getting succeed. Varu Dhawan need to learn humor from Govinda or his father. Dialogues are not hilarious but childish !! SRK Kajol chemistry somehow don't work here. May be they needed good script. Songs are OK. Digitally good. Exotic lands and special effects can create momentary effect but can't hold the movie. 1/5 for movie." 
" Rohit Shetty never ceases to disappoint with his mediocrity nor does Shahrukh Khan","I'm keeping an open mind to miracles, that is if this movie could still turn out to be good, despite the below average promos. But I was wrong. The movie is so bad, and we are all to blame for blindly following the star cast. Rohit Shetty did not disappoint with his Shitty Direction but i did not expect anything more from him. If you think Happy New year was a bad movie from this director? You're in for a treat, and it's not a treat you'd like. Moreover the script was probably given to some high school kid for his homework assignment. The color grading of the movie looks like an Overblown Android screen, watch Gerua for instance. I think I lost a bit of IQ today after watching this piece of crap." 
" worse movie of Kajol-Shahrukh","This is worse movie of Kajol-Shahrukh i had ever seen.The director tried to make this as usual comedy he do but didn't work properly.Barun and Kriti are good.Boman, Jony and others are worse.They didn't put 100% of Themself in this movie.Rohit Shetty should more careful.He works with a celebrity pair .And people expect so much from them.This movie may Disappointed Srk-Kajol fans.Some songs is great.Filming of this movie is just wonderful.Editing is also great.Ilove this editing very much.I am giving 2 points for editing.People are going to view SRK-Kajol chemistry not Rohit's comedy.Hope next time they will be more careful." 
" Worst movie of Rohit Shetty","Looks like Rohit shetty didn't have any story. A movie without plot/comedy/action.This movie has no surprise. Same predictable story. Kajol was good but have very limited role. Comedy punches are missing.You can't sell everything with the name of SRK an kajol. It should have content.In few scenes it was like copied from old rohit shetty's movies.I would consider this as worst movie of Rohit shetty.not even the regular action scenes.It's not entertainer for sure. After 30 minutes you will realize that it's same predicated movies with nothing new.Very disappointing." 
" I loved "Inception" but I hate "Dilwale"","To tell you the truth I've been waiting for the new Star Wars movie for a very long time. But it got pushed one week back due to this movie. Anyways, my exams got over on 17th and I needed to relax so I went to see Dilwale and that was one of the worst decisions I've ever taken. It was just the exact opposite of "relaxing". The plot was goofy, dialogues were goofy and on top of it all there was SRK, whose performance is getting worse with every passing second. The movie had nothing engaging. I've never left a movie halfway, so I decided to go through three hours of hell because I didn't want to ruin my record. Believe me that was a very brave thing to do. However unsurprisingly there were many SRK-fans who did enjoy the movie. So to put it in a nutshell, if you are an SRK fan then you are stupid enough to love this movie. For neutral moviegoers, don't even consider going for this mindless movie." 
" Movie is very bad, marketing was good.","They spent a lot of money on the product & on its marketing that no body gonna buy but in India its the Stars that are important not the story. so they gave what public wanted, pile of garbage wrapped in the gift box.Now they are so afraid and they do know that this movie is not receiving what they expected, now its IMDb page wont even show up in the Google search because public will know its true rating. Rohit Shetty you showed us how much hard work stunt crew put and yes they definitely do but you did not.You were the captain of this ship and now its your turn to accept your mistakes when its sinking(I doubt you ever will but....)." 
" Dilwale is Rohit Shetty's worst movie. It's painfully fake and hopelessly contrived; an assembly-line piece of garbage that mistakes the audience for a fool.","Here's the thing with Rohit Shetty movies: we know it's going to be the leave-your-brain-behind type. We know it's not going to make any sense. We know the internet trolls and the twitterati are going to bite into the movie even before it releases.And yet we watch it. For the simple reason that he makes us laugh.Somewhere in the middle of Chennai Express, the jokes had dried up, the quips and the crisp dialogue had thinned, and the monotony was there to be seen. Singham Returns exposed that even further.But this one takes the cake.Dilwale is Rohit Shetty's worst movie. It's painfully fake and hopelessly contrived; an assembly-line piece of garbage that mistakes the audience for a fool.So we have Shah Rukh Khan playing Kaali (go figure!), a retired son of a mafia boss, who lives with his younger brother Veer (Varun Dhawan) in Goa, the setting of many of Shetty's films. Veer's love interest is Ishita (a lovely Kriti Sanon). And Kaali has a brief, turbulent love-hate past with Meera (Kajol) in Bulgaria, which catches up with him later in his life.In the midst of all this there are mafia bosses, a local Goan don for the villain, a sidekick (Varun Sharma, aces it) and the usual Rohit Shetty comedians thrown in for good measure.This is a movie laced with stereotypes. Be it the step brothers with one of them being an orphan, or the painfully obvious plot twists, ones which can be seen from a mile away.In terms of performances, there's not much to do for Kriti Sanon except for looking really pretty. Varun Dhawan has done this kind of goofy man-child role in Main Tera Hero before; he's pretty much the same here.Kajol looks simply stunning, she's aged beautifully. Her acting credentials were never in doubt, but she's saddled with such a hopeless role and cringeworthy dialogue.Shah Rukh sleepwalks through this role, just like he's done in Happy New Year and Chennai Express. He's an absolute bore; his eyes grim and his face stoic.What is most disappointing is that the hullabaloo surrounding this movie was about the coup that Shetty managed to pull off with SRK and Kajol, unquestionably Bollywood's most chemically potent pair, and yet their chemistry is almost non-existent in Dilwale. Not being able to capitalize on SRK-Kajol's pair just goes to show what a shoddy mess the movie is. Yes, there are the occasional sparks, like the silent nod to the 'palat' scene from DDLJ, but those are few and far between.Almost all the lines fall flat, which is disappointing, especially coming from dialogue writers like Sajid-Farhad. The scenes look farcical, the acting extremely fake, and the jokes forced. Barely a couple of laughs are generated, mainly due to the ever-reliable Johnny Lever and another Priyadarshanesque montage leading to a hilariously confusing story.Shetty has always been 'inspired' by various films, as evidenced by the Golmaal series, Bol Bachchan and even Singham. With Dilwale, not only has he taken bits and pieces from trashy potboilers of the 80s, but this time he's gone further and taken a page out of a TV show.In the middle of the once-amazing CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, protagonist Ted Mosby meets a woman called Stella, and due to shortage of time, he takes her on a two-minute date, an extremely endearing montage, and one of the highlights of the show. Our man Shetty blatantly copies the concept, and it's neither impressive nor heartwarming.It's a shame to see Rohit Shetty start taking the audience for granted to such an extent. It's even more shameful that Shah Rukh Khan agreed to not only act in this mess, but also produce it. Dilwale is a mistake that will be difficult to erase.Somewhere in the middle of the movie, Varun Dhawan is proposing to Kriti Sanon. And in a bid to go all out, he plans to do the one thing that simply can't fail in Bollywood - SRK's arms-raised pose.He prays, 'Bhaiya, sambhaal lena'. Sure, he gets the girl. But not even his bhaiya can save this atrocity of a movie." 
" Utterly STUPID, CHEAP and ANNOYING movie","I'm totally disgusted with this movie, the story, screenplay, action, direction, music and what not. SRK and Kajol look very STALE, fail to act and emote, should retire and make room for freshers who can. I can't understand how people flock to theaters just to watch their favorite actors.Story is so stupid and makes us chuckle at times. The Ram Lal Dhobi twist is so disgusting and annoying. SUDDEN down pour of HEAVY, artificial rain in one scene makes us chuckle saying, "Holy crap" to ourselves. Flashbacks are done by a seemingly inexperienced director.Music is dumb and loud. We forget it the moment we walk out of the theater.There is no chemistry or character-building and when actors weep, it does not have any effect on us and it is even ANNOYING.Its a shame our standards have fallen to this low level. Avoid this one at all costs. Go watch Star Wars instead and you will be glad you skipped it." 
" Bad Story-line and avoidable at its best!","The movie is like a pendulum goes back and forth that too without any motion!!!!Poor story-line and too much hype makes it a boring journey overall. One can see this movie was made at an haste and was too eager to be released. Hence, this hype was created and it failed miserably to ride the hype wave.If anyone thinks this is anywhere close to DDLJ then they will be fooling themselves! Rohit Shetty is best suited for Golmal and not any other type of movie. Kajol is a sweetheart and SRK is at his disappointing best. Story-line is so poor that you start getting bored from the beginning. It seems like a typical Rohit Shetty movie where he tries yo mix-up the masala from 70s, 80s, and 90s....and we all know what happens to such movies!Anyways if you decide to watch this disappointing movie then please go with an open mind and please please please please don't expect any fire works! Dilwale is avoidable at its best!" 
" Even worse than Chennai Express and Happy New Year","I have no idea why this movie is getting higher ratings in here, must be bots up-voting the horrible movie. The movie was a pain to watch, with a handful of original comic moments. Shah Rukh Khan did a pretty horrible job of acting. Its disappointing that another bad movie of Shahrukh will do so well in the box office. Seriously, where are Bollywood's standards. I understand this is supposed to be a comedy/drama movie, but come on. Oh well, its made by Rohit Shetty, could not have expected anything better. The direction is horrible, more of a Tamil/Tollywood movie than a Bollywood movie. Cars flying, hero beating the crap out of 5-10 guys at once, I guess that turns on the audience." 
" Zero substance...zero fun...what a mess!","The lone star I give the movie is due to 2 causes. a.I can't rate it a zero, and, b.Kajol looks awesome in this movie. That is also, by the way, the only positive thing in this joke of a movie. That a movie like this has got such a wide release is in itself a miracle. This movie has a non-existential plot, stuff keeps happening due to no reason at all, and it just looks like everyone came to the set looking happy, just to bide the hours, and collect their paychecks. SRK may be a big star, and he is capable of good acting, but that has to wait for another day. This is utter rubbish. Looks like Rohit Shetty doesn't have any funny bones left in him anymore. He should either try and reinvent himself, or look for other career opportunities. You should not watch this, IMHO." 
" very bad","Another stupid movie for Indian consumers.Because of fan following this movie may earn well.But this movie will be worst movie of the year like last year happy new year What's Bad: Bringing back the most-loved Jodi of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol together, the film does not accomplish in capturing their epic romance. The comic capers start to fall apart soon thanks to their repetitive flavor.Just adding romantic scenes+some songs+some fights does not make good movie and I do not know for how many years Indian people will be fooled by these producers.I will rate 1/10 for this movie"
