" You can't fight racism","Finally there is a film based on an old topic, racism. I'm from the UK and there is isn't much racism as it's been shown in the film but there still is. The film was made so well and shows that Asians & blacks not only get harmed physically but also emotionally e.g. there things get broken or thrown away & eggs thrown on there face. The movie started off really interesting when the Sikh couple arrived at there bus stop late at night and where chased by the skinheads. During their funeral I felt really sorry for the victim's father when he said that his son's face has been cut so badly that he couldn't recognise him. In the scene when the boy's head was shaved and covered in flour, the suspense was killing me when he arrived at home panting and everyone were shockingly looking at him one at a time and I didn't have a clue that what did the skinheads did to him. The fight in the end was the best scene in the film because Sohail Khan was beaten-up very badly and we thought that he was finished but then his father animated him and he defeated Kane, on top of all that he was also arrested for murder. Sohail Khan, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and the actors who played Aslam Firoz & Kane were the best throughout the whole film." 
" Different fare and still entertaining","I never before have heard of the skinheads neo-Nazi group before, probably because I don't live in England.  I guess I could compare it to the KKK here in the US.  I live just a couple hours north of their headquarters!  I never really remember encountering one, though.  My parents said we ran into some in Martinsville, IN, but I was too young to remember it.  They also tell me about this group called "Dot Busters" where they used to shoot women with the dots on their forehead (Indians wearing bindis), but I don't think they exist anymore.  Anyways, I think one can only enjoy this movie if he/she can relate to it.  How much you like it depends on how much racism you've experienced or knowledge you have of such groups.  My geographic location let me enjoy the movie and the fact that I slightly remember how racist my society used to be in the late 80s-early 90s.  However, I am fortunate to say that society seems to be heading in the right direction in respect to racism, so I didn't have enough experience to like love this movie.Sohail Khan did a good job acting.  Since it was his production, I'm sure he had a passion for the story and could fully embody the character.  He has matured as an actor from his awful debut (don't even remember the name of it) to Darna Mana Hai and now I.  His bhabhi did a great job acting, and so did the little kid.  Aslam also was good.  After a long time, I saw a not-small budget film, and it was sure a nice experience after all the trashy movies that have come out this year.  Songs were not bad.  One thing I didn't like that much is that racism was responded to with violence.  In reality, I don't believe violence can solve ANYTHING." 
" Good plot, good message etc.","This movie has some very interesting aspects concerning Indian mentality towards racism or humiliation, which is (or was?) a basic problem. The movie had a very well done plot and good ideas. This film is something completely new. Now the movie was not about the fights, it had a very interesting message, which is something like: if you really want something to happen, and you have a strong will, it will happen. This film is perhaps also to provoke some kind of basic change of attitude towards humiliation and racism. (Which, by the way, does not goes towards violence, but a better awareness of the own dignity, self-respect and a stronger will, maybe.) It luminates also other basic problems, for example how easily racists can get the upper hand: "divide and rule". All in all the movie tries to bring a more clear idea of the whole theme of racism against Indians and to provoke a better awareness of everyone (for Indian AND British or generely whites).NOW, everyone who voted for under 8, is, in my opinion, either a skinhead himself or just does not care about the theme of racism or does not understand the seriousness of it or is a piece of meat." 
" good","It was deff a good movie. I was sad to see Aslam die.. he was so cute ! but deff a good movie. No awkward pauses or abrupt scenes. The songs.. i would say weren't too great. However the overall movie was great and sohil khan is deff a great actor. Hands down, he has improved a bunch and will continue to succeed. though the movie contains numerous new actors, never do you ever feel annoyed by their acting. everyones acting from sohils to the little kid amans are great. i would deff suggest this movie to anyone that is Indian and is unaware of the skinheads. hopefully the issue isn't as serious anymore and people are able to live peacefully. everyone should watch this movie" 
" Good.","Good Screenplay.Good Direction.Indians are Most Relative people.They are still very relative to U.K.America is escape..Iceland is eternity for every one.They should look 50% of time towards America and 50% of to Iceland.Skin Head are only meat.. no emotions..Donkeys are better than them... at least they carry load and work overhere...Thanks and Regards.Sam RupaniHouston, Texas, United States of America." 
" Shoddy at best","I would preface my review by saying that out of the 3 stars that I rated this movie, 2 would be solely for being somewhat original. The unfortunate circumstance that plagues the Indian movie industry is that most movies thrown at the mainstream are, more often than not, copies (to varying degrees) of foreign (mostly Hollywood) movies. Having finished anything good that I had to say about this movie, let's continue with why this movie is bad.Firstly, the worst part of the movie was the end. It was terribly cheesy and melodramatic and extremely disappointing. It was especially disheartening that after 9/10ths of the movie tried to portray the contemporary problem of racism (though the authenticity of the manner in which they have portrayed it is questionable), the end is probably the furthest they could have taken you from providing a practical solution. This is unfortunately very typical of Bollywood, where melodramatic, half-baked stories are thrown to the masses with a veil of some sort of social activism / awakening, but very predictably ending in an anti-climax.Secondly, it provides a very uni-dimensional view of racism. It reminded me, amusingly, of old westerns where the good cowboys wore white hats and the bad ones wore black. This film suffers from a terribly oversimplified notion of racism. It's a little too black-and-white. (If you want to see a better movie about skinheads watch 'This is England' http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480025/).Thirdly, though the acting is not as atrocious as it could be, given the cast, it is definitely not anything notable. The lead actor as others have observed can be said to have improved from his earlier work, but has still a looooong way to go before he can be said to be a good actor.Fourthly, the camera work was also nothing great. One reviewer remarked that this movie was good because it had "No awkward pauses or abrupt scenes" - true, but is that really an achievement that one should credit a professional with?! Isn't that the basic minimum one should expect from a film-maker?! On the other hand, I wished that there was better camera work when they covered parts such as the graffiti on the walls, which proved to be quite unreadable.All in all, this film is quite shoddy, and makes a mess of an otherwise pertinent issue. I would say don't waste your time watching it." 
" Very Much Fine Movie","very authentic nice direction by punit issar and an awesome patriotic feeling the movie starts with a great feeling in India. and there goes a bang on voyage of a person to fight for the honor of his country. and his life there changes suddenly. the movie is to quote the sacrifices made by INDIANS by moving on to another country. but while directing the movie it was also taken care that no outsider feeling is hurt. the person who portray image of a villain was not a normal person. and so he can not be considered as an outsider. and so the counter balancing part in a movie is an attention seeker thanks to ALL the crew member for giving such a nice movie to Indian cinema.when i watched this movie first time. i was really amazed, great acting. great direction and every thing above the mark." 
" Racist","Oh wow no other formula available so take a story of how indians are treated badly in a racist manner in London The story seems too old now and the Londons are painted black and our Indians are full of heartAs in most Hindi films dealing with patriotism this too is similarSohail Khan again returns in an action mode after his failed debut in MDTD(2002) and a small appearance in DARNA MANA HAI(2003)he bangs up anybody and most London gorasIn between he gets chance to emote and romance tooThis is like a showreel to him afterall his 2nd home production(by know his most films are home productions) He doesn't even have a name in this film he is called IThe story follows the GHAYAL formula and reminds of GHAYAL in many scenes and is tad too predictable Direction by Puneet Sira(not Puneet Issar) is good in some portions Music is badSohail Khan is better in serious roles then his stupid comic roles however he is too wooden(though has improved a bit now in drama) and in emotional scenes he needs work The heroine is forgettable Khulbushan Kharbanda excels, Mona is too good Aasif Sheikh is good the Pakistani and the main villain are too theatrical"
