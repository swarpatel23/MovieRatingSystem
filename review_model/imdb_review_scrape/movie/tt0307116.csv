" Good action movie!","Maa Tujhe Salaam is Sunny Deol's 3rd movie of the patriotic trilogy of 2001. After the major successes of Gadar and Indian, Sunny is at it again, this time in Kashmir as a Commando, protecting the villagers against terrorists. Sunny Deol is the real macho-man (muscleman) among the other tough stars, and he is just brilliant in the action scenes, which are awesome. I just love it when he roars, as that just boils your blood so hard that you will do anything for the honor of your country. Tabu does well as a supporting commando, but the movie belongs to Sunny Deol. He is just the best action hero in Bollywood. The climax was just amazing and mind-blowing, as Sunny blows out baddies with big machine guns. Later, he is hit by bullets while going uphill with the Indian flag, but Sunny is just unstoppable, and he vanquishes the baddies and then is hospitalized and survives (ending like Imtihaan). Sunny wins the day, yet again. Jai Hind! Sunny Deol Zindabad!"
