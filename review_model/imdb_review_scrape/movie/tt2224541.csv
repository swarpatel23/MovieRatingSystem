" ----TLT ----- Tutiya Dil","TLT actually stands for "Total Loss of Time". I am really sorry that I watched this particular movie till the end. It was a great loss of my time.The acting is way below average.The part that really bother that there was no real story. They wanted use some material but they got all messed up. The comedy of the movie was horrible also.They waste a lot of money in makeup. Throughout the movie all the actresses was highly plastered with low class makeup. I can barely see the actress's real face :(In my opinion there is no need to watch this film because the film is worthless in so many levels."
