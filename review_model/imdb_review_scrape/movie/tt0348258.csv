" Genelia rocks","Ritesh Deshmukh was not a star with his first movie.In fact he was relegated to back seat while Genelia Desouza showed a sparkling performance. The story is told countless times. Yet it made the impact because of the taut screenplay. The comedy scenes in the first half are really funny. The second half is more like a Karan Johar movie. In nutshell it can be seen for Genelia who is gorgeous enough to make me watch the movie. Also one can see and learn that how Ritesh transformed himself from the shy guy in this movie to the stud of "KKHH" and "ASMM". The music by Viju Shah is also fabulous and title track is no less than magical.Overall it's a nice teen movie with light hearted comedy.Go, watch it if you haven't till now." 
" Ritiesh debut movie shows how perfect Comedian he is!","Its the first movie of Ritiesh, and I had watched this movie 8th time in theater. It has everything you need. Starts with superb jokes and comic scenes between Ritiesh and his friends. All are so good and superb, you wont believe. This movie is the special one. Plenty of jokes and life of a college student with a silent love. Apart from Ritiesh there are three more newcomers in the movie. Genelia is very pretty and does a pretty job too in this movie, Raja and Shriya is also good but not much impressive. Supporting casts Shakti, Jaspal Bhatti, Satish Shah, Supriya, Anuradha, Sushma Seth and Vijayendra does a great job from their end. But its Ritiesh who handles the movie on his soldier. As a debutant he works so good, so much jokes and a silent lover. Guys go and watch this one, This is not a movie which you miss. Songs are amazing too. Title song is my best one."

" Ritiesh and Genelia's below average debut.....","Ritiesh Deshmukh who is Late CM Vilasrao Deshmukh's son debutted with this film alongwith Genelia Dsouza Nobody could ever expect in this film that Ritiesh will make a place for himself slowly but steadily due to his sheer talent. The film is a typical Kuch Kuch Hota Hai type love story, minus any drama but very predictable and formulaic. The film is a remake of a Telugu film Nuvve Kavali (2000) and is directed too by A South Indian Director K Vijay Bhaskar. The film is an okay romantic film,typical to the core, there are some forced humour scenes like the naukrani track The end too is abrupt,also the Shreya Saran's part is forgotten laterDirection is okay Music by Viju Shah was goodRitiesh was raw as an actor but did impress in some scenes but was a bit too reserved and raw in his debut, also his dialogue delivery was odd,luckily he worked hard and proved his talent slowly Genelia plays a prequel of her role in JTYJN but she was too raw here, but okay in scenes,she too had a bad dialogue delivery Shriya Saran is wasted in a cameo,Satish Shah,Shakti Kapoor are all good, Supriya Pilgaonkar entertains but at times overacts rest are okay"
