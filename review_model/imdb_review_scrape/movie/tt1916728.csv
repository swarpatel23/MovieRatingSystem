" Mind-blowing Chaos",""When the noise is deafening, can you really hear yourself?"(If you can't hear it, you're OBVIOUSLY dead)The whole movie is about a chaotic scenario that occurs during the Ganapathi Mahotsav in Mumbai. It's told in a multi linear narrative as there are mainly 3 stories happening the same time But no attempt is made to forcefully intertwine the stories and that's one interesting and distinct aspect of the film.All the characters are very well tailored Undoubtedly Tusshar's best movie till date But the actor who dazzles here is Pitobash Tripathy as the eccentric small-time goon Mandook, who steals every scene he's in He is the epicenter of most of the chaos and his role is just a masterpieceIt's surprising and disturbing and has a vein of rich, dark humor coursing through it. After the unforgettable comedy '99', directors Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK continue their great job with Shor. The script is crisp, tight and spattered with some smart, funny one-liners and is consistent till the end. There are many occasions to laugh out loudly especially the time bomb sequence. The movie also boasts a rivetingly smart climax.In short, Shor in the City is a total buzz on! And one note: Do wait till the end credits finish rolling... The surprises don't end with the film..." 
" A Modern masterpiece..indeed shor (noise) is good sometimes...","Two years ago a movie released without much of hype and promotion that was '99" directed by Raj Nidimoru & Krishna DK .. there was something weirdly brilliant in the film which has some restless characters like we often come across in a Guy Ritchie films... Coming to 2011 the same director duo took restlessness in a metro city to another altitude in "Shor in the city".. Shor means "Noise" and the concept of noise has been depicted very well throughout the film..Without giving any spoilers there are 3 stories running parallel in the heart land of Mumbai and the stories get connected in the end. It is one of the awesome dark humorous films of India which keeps you involved with the three stories and how noise plays a imp role internally as well as externally creating a metamorphosis of each protagonist ... The restlessness has been portrayed with a sharp editing in the beginning going to and fro with each stories thus building the tension and that elevates to higher decibel till the climax happens. Watch it for the unique treatment of the director duo, the awesome camera work of Tusshar kanti Ray (who did a superb job earlier this year with urban classy Dhobi Ghaat) and equally commendable sound design by Jordi Cirbian which plays the crux of the execution.. And coming to acting department Pitobash is a new talent to watch for.. Hindi cinema is changing from it routine over the top execution and I sincerely hope more films like Shor in the City are being made which are technically brilliant as well as entertaining. Also Ekta Kappor should be applauded for backing this kind of cinema. (previous year she backed the technically brilliant Dibakar Banerjee's Love Sex aur Dhoka)..Go for this Noise , you will not regret. Thumps up to the director duo.P.S: For those who love song n dance.. well there is no dance but a beautiful romantic song Saibo which has been shot beautifully.." 
" Decent watch","Instantly liked the movie. Unarguably, one of the better Bollywood movies of the year. I would count "Phans gaya re Obama" and "Shor" as some of the finest products of coming of age Indian cinema.If I may take the liberty, I perceive "Shor" as a "Dhobi Ghat" (DB) on crack. While DB is very subtle, understated and subdued, "Shor" is pulsating, vibrant, chaotic and tantalizing. Snippets of dark humor here and there, but nothing surmounting to the backdrop of Mumbai. Again, unlike DB the story lines never cross, nor do the characters inter-wine. However, the crisp editing and repeated cuts to cyclical plots make it seem that way. The film essays eleven days worth of events in the lives of three different sets of inhabitants trying to slug it out in Mumbai City leading up to the festival of Ganesha Chaturthi.Three bootleggers (Tilak, Mandook and Ramesh) live off cheap thrills, carrying out petty crimes, and following up with debauchery in local bars. An expatriate Abhay, relocates to Mumbai to start a business. And an aspiring cricketer, Sawan, looks to make a big name for himself. It is hard to say weather these guys seek out troubles or is it the other way round. Abhay faces local turbulence in the form of street ruffians who demand protection money, and cannot seem to make the city welcoming. He wants to like it, but can't seem to like it. The cricketers' despair is to overcome the extraordinary competition by bribing the officials with money. And Tilak has a plan for future and sees his business expanding if he takes up more responsibilities.The only common thread which resonates with the" Shor in the city" is the metamorphosis of these inhabitants. Abhay, does he what he has to do; grows out of his mainstream sophistication and grabs the bull by its horns. Sawan, disowns the loot, that he so meticulously plans, for something better than his obsession. Tilak gets a breather and walks out unscathed, as he watches the kid dance to the tune of Ganesha in full glory. Mandook and Ramesh, cannot seem to let go of their tomfoolery, which leads to their predicaments. In doing so, all of them find themselves closer to their hearts and lovers.The music is quite good. Most of the tracks play when people are running around or riding their bikes. Then there is beautiful depiction of disorder, as the city itself morphs into a loud and tumultuous world. Edgy direction and low-key actors, excluding Tusshar Kapoor, bounce off the screen as every day folks which are very identifiable in sync with the script. Sendhil Ramamoorthy (Abhay) looks radiant and very different from his Mohindar of "Heroes". Shor is a different movie in a very real sense and a very decent watch." 
" SITC made all the right sounds","Another slick Mumbai stories about a bunch of people trying to make things work in this mad city. The story has five main characters a small time publisher of pirated books, couple of small time thugs, an NRI trying to start a business in India and a young boy trying hard to make his name in corrupt cricket world. The lives of all the characters intertwine during the course of the plot. Tushar kapoor's acting is just on par at best and so are most actors, including Senthil Ramamurty who plays NRI Abhay in fact seems to be overacting in parts. The surprise element was Pritosh Tripatht playing 'Mandook' he is a revelation very believable in his role of a dumb goon/ sidekick.The movie has a fresh feel and the song 'Saibo' very melodious. Overall a good attempt by directors Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK." 
" Hilarious Chaos in the Sheher","I wasn't expecting much of Krishna D.K. and Raj Nidimoru's 'Shor In The City'. Despite the rave reviews, I was under the impression that this would be another one of those slick-wannabe crime thrillers. I'm glad that I was wrong because the film positively surprised me.Intertwined stories are becoming quite common in Hindi cinema and I enjoy them when they're told well. Here the link between them isn't significant in the sense that it's not what the story focuses on. The connection is shown smoothly. Each story has its own strength but for me the best one was that of Tilak which was refreshing and it had a wicked sense of humour. The sequence with the child and the bomb and the scenes that follow (concerning the child) still make me laugh. The scenes between Tilak and his wife are also amusing. The Sawan story presents an interesting theme but I felt the romantic angle was a little melodramatic. The Abhay story has a deja vu feel to it but it's well told and engaging.The cinematography is stunning. It captures the rawness and authenticity of the title city and citylife very well. The background score, sound and art direction are brilliant. The pacing is slightly uneven as it tends to go slow in the middle. The performances of Zakir Hussain, Sendhil Ranamurthy, Tusshar Kapoor, Nikhil Dwivedi, Sundeep Kishan and Pitobash are good too (in the given order). The women hardly get any scope but Radhika Apte is a delight to watch.The main highlight of 'Shor In The City' is its detailed screenplay which is also co-written by D.K. and Nidimoru (who have done a fantastic job as directors). Overall, 'Shor in the City' has been a pleasant and funny surprise." 
" Good Movie","Shor in the City may be another dekko at merry, murky, mad city Mumbai but not once do you get a sense of deja vu. And that's because this one's a completely quirky cameo on a city that continues to hypnotize people with its chameleon hues. The film posits the metropolis as a character in the film. One that is as jagged, enigmatic and hysterical as the living-breathing protagonists of the film. And yet, despite the hurtling-towards-doom scenario, there is an undercurrent of hope and innocence which seems to spring from the most unusual places. Like Tusshar Kapoor's character and the die-hard aspiring young cricketer's zeal... The threesome of Tusshar, Nikhil and Pitobash form the central core of the film. It's a tangy desi Reservoir Dog's combo, with Nikhil Dwivedi and Pitobash Tripathi providing the edge and Tusshar pitching in the equipoise. His discovery of Paulo Coelho and his uplifting psy-co-low- gee, as he tries to read The Alchemist, dictionary in hand, is so very funny and funky. All this, while he is also trying to discover the sensual charms of his newly-wedded wife, Radhika Apte, and his friends are trying to distract him with their treasure of AK-47s and 56s. Senthil Ramamurthy's track is equally spicy too, specially his encounters with gangster Zakir Hussain who can't understand why the oaf can't understand the petty gangster's code that rules Mumbai. Not even, when it's a matter of life and death. With a zany screenplay (Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK), excellent cinematography by Tushar Kanti Ray and peppy music by Sachin-Jigar, Shor in the City is another breaking-norm film from Ekta Kapoor (producer) after Love Sex aur Dhokha and Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai. Don't miss this black comedy that has heart and soul." 
" Shor in the City - Guy Ritchie in Mumbai!","Shor in the city is one of the finest movies released in 2011 from the usual trash producing bollywood. The treatment is more like babel but mumbai as the location adds color to the story. It indeed lives as a character in the movie! Wonderful performances from everyone and the script is well executed. Its damn right funny at times and pretty intense when it has to be. The crooks, the mafia, tushar & radhika apte brings life to the story. The dialogs are hilarious and there is a small sweet melody which bleeds nothing but romance. If you like Guy Ritche films or you just want to see something other than the usual run of the mill films, this would be a good choice." 
" A ride full of fun and thrill.","The movie is a cock-tale of three stories simultaneously taking place in Mumbai within the span of 11 days of Ganesh Chaturthi. The narration consists of three different class and tastes having different background struggling in one or the other way to get a place in the heart of India.Let me mention one name first of all, Pitobash Tripathy. I remember him right from the 3 Idiots. I knew the man has got the talent and he has accorded himself very well in the character. He brings in the gags in each and every scene he is featured.The film has got one of the strongest end credits and all thanks to the brilliant scene in the end credit.Rensil has a descent debut and is same with Preeti Desai.Stories,though simple, are well narrated. Screenplay is engaging.Writing team comprising Raj Nidimoru, Krishna D.K., Sita Menon has done a good job.Editing is good.The track fails to show the third story connecting with the other two in the end. Tusshaar Kapoor's track could have been chopped a little.Music is unconventional.All songs are used in the background score which boosts the movie in a positive way.In the end, this "Shor" is a must watch!" 
" The One Minute Film Review: Shor in the City","There has indeed been a lot of "shor" throughout 2011. The cacophony of corruption , the noise made by Anna Hazare against it , the cheer of India triumphing at the cricket world cup , the hullaballoo of the royal wedding , the euphoria surrounding Osama's death and not to forget the annoying IPL trumpet.We are indeed living in noisy times. Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK get it right stating with the title itself.Mumbai in the last few years has ceased to be the dream city conjured up by Bollywood over the years. It has emerged into the city of the Slumdog , of Aamir , of Dhobhi Ghat and now as a noisy ,dirty and eccentric metropolis.Three stories run parallely during the Ganpati festival. Each story deals with fringe characters desperate to make it into the mainstream. So we have petty criminals , foreign returned Indians and an out of favour cricketer. In Inarritu style they criss-cross each other's lives which culminates into the climax.Hats off to the directors for the mood they lend to the film. The opening credits run amidst chaotic Mumbai streets where cars narrowly miss you. A sense of claustrophobia persists throughout along with intense , scorching heat. The bustling and crowded outdoors , the narrow dingy lanes , the deserted rooftops hardly give you any breathing space. The viewer is immediately overtaken by a sense of visual noise.The sudden cuts coupled with edgy music and pedestrian language keeps the narrative tight. Again , hardly any breathing space anywhere. The performances blend into the story. Pitobash as Mandook stands out. Special mention for Tusshar (he's dropped the Kapoor) here for whom its been a long journey from Bore to Shor .The 'shor' gets heightened as Tilak (Tusshar) who been married for a while now hardly even knows his wife. The story unfolds during the Ganesha festival with his idols dotting the city. But its almost as if God himself has been rendered helpless against the times. Is he just an excuse for another festival? While the ending may remind one of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver , its best left to the viewer to be the judge of it.This is a film "full of sound and fury" Signifying existence in between -Sushovan Sircar for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com" 
" Chaos","Mumbai is not a mere city. It's a phenomenon. Paragon of diversity. Umpteen movies have explored its idiosyncrasies multitude of times that now any movie on Mumbai, honestly, looks the same. But somehow, I had a positive expectations from 'Shor in the City'. Babel like concept of showing several loosely connected events happen in parallel, the characters fading in the chaos of the city. Three petty thieves trying to cash in every opportunity, one NRI trying to establish his own business, One struggling cricketer trying to get entry to the big stage. It's not an out-and-out comedy. So expectations to have lots of laughs is going to fall falter. Promising start. Unfortunately, lost me midway because of mundanity. The last 15 minutes was the saving grace for the initial tedium. Overall, a pretty average movie. Could have been so much better. Watchable. Some appreciable performances (the NRI part is good)." 
" Excellent,Brilliant!","Shor in the Cit directed by Krishna D.K and Raj Nididmoru is an excellent movie.With a captivating story,strong performances,stylish narrative, water-tight screenplay makes Shor In The City a must watch!Story:Chapter 1: A n NRI Abhay (Snedhil Ramamurthy) faces threats from extortionist (Zakir Hussain) when he opens a small business and goes out with an aspiring model. He refuses to pay, both are stalked, and when he complains to the police, they not only shrug it off but offer 'protection' for a price. With increasing pressure, he must now make a decision to re-locate or submit to their demands. Chapter 2:Tilak (Tusshar) and his friends,Ramesh (Nikhil Dwivedi) and Mandook (Pitobash) are career criminals, and sell merchandise that they steal from passengers using public transportation. He also buys best-selling novels, has copies printed, and has them sold at busy traffic signals. Things change when his group find guns and an explosive device in a stolen bag. Chapter 3:Sawan Murthy (Sundeep Kishan) wants to be a cricketer and must come up with Rs.10 Lakhs in order to be inducted in the 20/20 team. He has no money, nobody will lend him any, and he considers robbing the Citizen's Co-operative Bank. Just some of the challenges faced by regular Mumbaites and criminals in this crime-laden city. Each and every chapter has a vibrant story.The director duo do a marvelous job.The screenplay is water-tight.The dialogs are excellent. .Especially the ones delivered by Pitobash.Performances:Chapter 1:Sendhil Ramammurthy delivers a fine performance while Zakir Hussain is menacing as the extortionist.Chapter 2:Tusshar Kapoor stands out.Pitobash does a fantastic job.Nikhil Dwivedi is subtle.Chapter 3:Sundeep Kishan is good.All in all,Shor in the City is a movie with power-packed performances,enthralling story and water-tight screenplay.I am going to give a seven on ten." 
" Well played film of intertwined stories again in Bollywood film making","2010 is way past in Bollywood, but you will enjoy the film as relevant to the current trend in film-making, ignoring the recent developments. This gives you a hint of how futuristic are the makers of this film in story development.The movie at times, will slow you down in entertainment, being selfish for its progression, but will gradually pick up the pace and present you with remarkable scenes.Moreover, the first half of the movie is all about introductions, which I felt quite boring, but you will understand soon enough the reasons with the story-telling." 
" A rarity of sorts a well told bollywood film","A rarity of sorts a well told bollywood filmIt comes as a surprise amid the badly told stories that have intent but no good narration in our Hindi film industry. This one is a surely well narrated script that it's share of good moments and rarely something is off place and in fact not more than a couple. To begin with, its a story of a bunch of youngsters who are fighting there circumstances and want to get into better state where there is peace. One finds in books, other in getting rid of those who bother him and another in cricket practice. It's built on unrelated stories and is not connected either and that turns out to be a great plus. Seen movies in which a couple or more stories and knit for the climax but this has independent stories and thus climax is independent too. The backdrop and the day of the climax are set as Ganesh Navaratri, the most famous social festival that is also the abode of many crimes in cities. There is humor, violence and touch of sensitivity that brings in characters in a city that is considered to be busiest in India, its a living slice of Mumbai for sure.The negative things is production value, the movie at times seems to ave misused the camera focus and also trying to use natural lighting only, it opens the aperture too wide of camera where is one shot, we see too much of direct sun light and in another, there is darkness among three characters that makes them obscure. Also, there is a tinge of simpleness too like in a scene, Tushar Kapoor is shot and no one cares and later he simply walks away. The most endearing personality in the movie was Mandook played by Pitobash Tripathy. Kudos to writers-directors for bringing light to such a smart script and to producers for giving this script the funds to make it to big screen. This one seems to have been lost amid the non-sense Hindi films as it does not boast of stupendous publicity or star cast, it will still have its place in a viewer who likes original cinema.My rating, 3/5." 
" (Sigh) Wish we had more like this","Had know the director duo only by their earlier works - the middling 'Flavors' (which a new-to-Indie audience had embraced - always a good thing) and the sub-par '99'. Added to that, there was almost no marketing done for the flick (again, common with Indies), and I had no clue what I was walking into, or what to expect. This movie, like some movies, does not succeed due to the lack of expectations on my part / few others as well. It weaves multiple threads, without losing control of a single one, and keeps one entertained throughout, while also amping-up the curiosity factor from sequence to sequence, make our awaiting the denouement almost unbearable, finally tying things up neatly as well.Stylistically and painstakingly shot, this Neo-noir ensemble pack is engrossing all the way, with some fantastic performances from both the familiar and the unknown. To me, this is a star-making turn from Pitobash, and he's sunk his teeth into this role deep. You can't take your eyes off of him whenever he's on-screen, not knowing if his character'll explode/make you laugh. Sendhil Ramamurthy, who I'd known from 'Heroes', also acquits himself well, but his role's not a big stretch. Dwiwedi and Kapoor are fine too, as are Apte and Desai.Mumbai has been depicted many times on the big screen, but this is perhaps one of those times where it figures more prominently than it ever has, they way the director duo made Delhi more than just the backdrop in '99' (which was more of a miss than a hit, something they've more than made up for with this effort).I'll indulge these 2 every time their work hits the big screen, and I'm confident that I'll enjoy more than most." 
" A relief in present times.","Certainly one of the few films in today's Bollywood that provides a refreshing outlook for all the viewers. I found the story was very nice and most of all the direction was tight and crispy. The characters were adorable and given screen times properly. The chemistry between Tushar Kapoor and his wife was amazing only if he could have acted more nicely. The story demonstrates the lives of common people in a very charming way. The way I see it, it is one of the best stories of the Bollywood in present times. When we have a nice story we surely can ignore some of the plot holes. When I found that Ekta Kapoor was involved in the film, I was shocked because seriously I never thought for a moment that she could come out of Saas Bahu Mania. Tushar Kapoor should really look into some other career options sooner or later.MESSAGE: "Life goes on, try and enjoy as much as possible." VERDICT: "A must watch for all Bollywood Fans."" 
" Something unique","Shor in the City released in April 2011 and made big news for many reasons like it got several acclaim in the film festivals and also it was Ekta's release after OUATIM and RAGINI MMS.In fact from the face of it, the film may look like just another comedy type film but it's not The film showcases mumbai in 3-4 different stories There is an NRI story who falls into trouble with underworld, then some bunch of goon type guys who rob books and stuff, a boy who wants to get into cricket team.etcThe film slowly moves and yet you get engrossed, laugh at some places and also has several thrills, The film isn't the normal bollywood masala and should be praised for being something hatke. The film holds your attention throughout except at some places when it does get a bit slow but that is forgivenDirection Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K. who return after the riveting 99(2009) do a fab job Music is superb, "Saibo is the bestTusshar Kapoor shows his talent for once perhaps, normally a fine actor especially in GAYAB but often cast in nonsense roles He does a good job in his role Nikhil Dwivedi often seen in nonsense films does a great job too Pitobash is the discovery, the actor was seen in a small part in 3 Idiots but here gets a meaty role and does a brilliant job Sendhil Ramamurthy is good with his role Zakir is superb, Sundeep Kishan is good too, Amit Mistry is superb as usual Amongst gals Radhika Apte is decent while Preeti Desai makes a good debut"
