" The intentions are noble but such subjects need to be much bolder and hard-hitting to leave an impact.","At times, few films rightly and nobly bring forward a burning social issue, pointing towards the questionable faulty structure of our society, giving us some food for thought. But sadly, they are not made with that finesse and are not able to deliver the message that impactfully as required to reach the targeted common man. Evidently RAJJO remains one of those well intentioned films, made on a bold subject of 'giving the forced-in prostitutes' their respectable place back in the society, defying the set rules of a Hindi film. Yet, it is not able to leave any kind of solid impression on the viewers, due to its lazy screenplay and passionless, ineffective portrayal of a relevant issue.Supported by some extremely talented names such as Mahesh Manjrekar, Prakash Raj, Jaya Prada (a cameo), Vipin Sharma, Uttam Singh, Binod Pradhan & more, the film should have been much better lead by Kangna playing the women-centric role of sex-worker. However, director Vishwas Patil is not able to materialize on his subject and cast as desired, resulting in a pretty below average film quite unfortunately. It begins with the Mumbai 'Kothas' raising the expectation levels, reminding you of films like Mahesh Bhatt's SADAK which had Pooja Bhatt, in somewhat similar role along with Sanjay Dutt. But the un-happening first half completely ruins the initial excitement and then few better scenes post interval are also not able to bring it back till the end.Music, which ideally should be a highlight of films with such themes, is another big disappointment here and so is the writing or dialogue department of the film too, giving you nothing above than the routine. There is an improved Kangna in action along with the confident Paras Arora enacting with the big names with an ease. Plus the director also tries to express his storyline without taking the help of any objectionable language, abusive or vulgarity. So, no doubt the film had a very commendable and noble thought behind its making looking at the final product, but I only wish they had worked more on its script, music, dialogues and hard-hitting element in particular, which is a must for such socially relevant subjects to leave a lasting impact." 
" Movies is good","Very different movie. The movie has different story as compared to movies which are produced by Bollywood.The Songs are good.People do the good acting.Dialog are also good.In this we can see the true love. The role of husband and wife is beautiful performed.The dialog's look good to me.The fighting and the difficult they face and after that they remain together. The way his wife ignore the offers of jobs. I really like the movie. I love the end of the movie." 
" Terrible","There is only one word to describe the Kangana Starrer Rajjo- ie Terrible. It is so bad that it makes you wonder why Kangana and other prominent actors like Mahesh Manjrekar,Prakash Raj,Kishore Kadam and Vineet Sharma acted in this film. The film began with a encouraging 1st first half which was brought down by an uninspiring and outdated 2nd half. The music is also uninspiring and makes you wonder whether the same Uttam Singh composed the songs for Dil toh pagal Hai or Gadar. The direction and the setting of the movie will make you feel as if you are watching a movie made in 80s or 90s. In terms of acting, Kangana was the only saving grace of the film. Meanwhile talented actors like Mahesh Manjrekar, Prakash Raj respective roles were wasted. The film would have been better only if it had a proper screenplay and good music as well." 
" Disappointed with Kangana","Okay, I saw this movie even after seeing all the bad ratings and reviews for the movie, only because i trust Kangana's choice of movies. I am a big fan of her work but this one is right at the bottom.7 National award winners were part of the team so I thought it would be a good movie..but what a huge let down..No Comedy, No Drama, No Romance, and not even good performances from the star cast.I am giving it a five because of Kangana's performance, which was below her high standards but still okay. I am giving it a five for Kangana and the 'Chatt Gayi Nindiya Song'.Its a movie worth avoiding." 
" Single Different Factor. â™¦ 34%","And that factor is how teenage boys get lured into the lust & beauty of sex business. That is a true point that Rajjo constantly makes in its cheesy plot.There is the prostitution business headed by Mahesh Manjrekar as an eunuch whose character was not only unnecessary but too gaudy. Kangana Ranaut, who seems to have worked hard for the role, is a dancer who is in demand. The people who demand her are of course, the hero & the villain. No prizes for guessing who the villain is and all he did throughout the 140 minutes of play was what he did in Wanted, Singham, Dabangg 2, Policegiri & Zanjeer if we concentrate on Bollywood, that is. The guy who played the hero is acceptable. How certain politics ensues further along with the immense drama culminates in a predictable ending. Apparently, the main plot element is too fictitious to bear.There are some issues with the person who wrote the dialogs, for they seem to be funny & catchy & fiery but if you think upon them, they are straight bland & baloney. The art department is very good, indeed & withdrawing the talk about the film's technicalities, I rate it a generous 3.4 out of 10 for sending a thin message, which could've been told in a better manner, sans the flesh show. Songs are below average unless you are a drunk dancing in a roadside country bar.BOTTOM LINE: Kangana baring it all but still not exposing herself may prolong her Bollywood stay. But Rajjo, as a film, fails. It is better to read the story in Wikipedia & forget the show.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?
