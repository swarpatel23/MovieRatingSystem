" Wonderful!!! A treat to watch","I am very surprised with the number of negative comments out there for this film..OK it might be a copy of an English film but why can't anybody ignore that and appreciate the amazing performances.Vinay Pathak as usual is in superlative form.It amazes me how he picks up the minutest of details for his character.I won't say that it was like a never before seen kind of movie but it definitely was a heart warming one.A simple movie which had special moments of its own..One special mention for Lara Dutta.She acted beautifully and was at par with Vinay Pathak in each and every scene.An unusual pairing but that was the plus point of this movie.Recommending everyone to watch this film." 
" A definite hidden gem amongst the larger more pretentious productions","This was more of a gamble and I had left it last to watch but I'm glad that I did because Chalo Dilli provided me with plenty of laughter and surprise.Vinay Pathak wasn't the surprise- he's a really underrated actor who's more than capable of taking the lead role of a movie and turning it into a success and joy to watch and this is but a shining example. I felt that he was never irritating, loud or obnoxious. The best description of his character that comes to my mind is "happy go lucky." Whatever situation or jam that he gets himself in he never gives up and it was amazing to watch him make friends everywhere. The dialogue is very good and the jokes are very funny, even the visual gags.For me Lara Dutta turned out to be the surprise package with a very good performance. I've never really thought much of her acting abilities but here she does a very good job as a stuck up high profile modern business woman who comes unglued as the movie progresses. Yes, she looks very glamorous and high profile but it suited the character. What she brought to the role was pep and edge. She wasn't rude or obnoxious and she certainly wasn't above remorse and making apologies.The movie itself had several things going for it. For one they didn't make the two lead characters fall in love with each other. There was no sexual tension, no longing looks and hence there was no need for pointless love songs to appear and the wrong moments. Even the songs that were in the movie were well placed.Lara Dutta's character wasn't a one dimensional person who does an about turn at the end and becomes opposite to what she started out as, unlike most of the Indian movies where a character starts out as stuck up, rude and arrogant but withing a few scenes turns into a demure, polite, law abiding and super nice person. Her change is gradual and only reflects what's within her and that's more of an insight as opposed to a behavioural change.This is a really fun movie to watch at any time of day and is definitely not a waste of time. Sometimes strangers can turn out to be saints in disguise, opening facets that lie hidden deep within, unknown to ourselves, and when opened can turn our lives upside down, bringing new adventures and insights for a better life. In Chalo Dilli Vinay provides that stranger while Lara represents the rest of us." 
" nice movie","before sitting in cinema hall i was thinking that i am going to watch jab we met part 2, but when i read the cast i got to know that it would be a different movie, because Lara Dutta and Vinay Pathak were together but after watching whole movie i realized i have been cheated this movie is copied from Plain, Train, Automobile. Any way i am not against copied movies because some time director use his own mind to copy scenes,and i like that. so friends, movie is good, time pass, one time watch, but don't confuse yourself with director's idea to show Jaipur and Rajasthan, rajastan is not like that. there are two flaws in movie, first of all jhunjunu is not between Ajmer and Delhi and there in no flyover in behror, even people of rajasthan are damn friendly. now lets talk about the movie, The first half of the movie is quite interesting Mr. Vinay pathak was the best fit for that role m not sure about lara dutta because she was looking aged in that movie, i like her in comedy role not the serious one. the entry of akshay kumar was awesome but the dialogue delivery was just OK, the second half is little boring but when climax is good some how it was not expected climax. so guys go for this movie if you like different movie and please don't watch plain train, automobile before that it will spoil your fun :)" 
" Its mostly an enjoyable and appealing fun ride..., but I wish the makers had the courage to acknowledge their original source of inspiration.","Inspired or Copied films have always discouraged me to write about them in length. But once in a while comes a film which though is not an original, but still remains a descent one having some new entertaining additions in its script, which keep the viewers hooked for most of its duration. CHALO DILLI is also one of those very few films which compel you to praise them despite the fact that they are clearly inspired. The last movie which gave me a similar kind of feeling was the well directed "Taxi No. 9-2-11" (2006) which was largely based on "Changing Lanes" (2002).The film revolves around the unplanned journey of two opposite sex strangers who come from a completely different background and are forced to live one night and day together in absence of any other choice. Lara Dutta is a happily married rich corporate business woman, habitual of living an up-standard life and Vinay Pathak is a middle class ladies garments shop owner in Chandni Chowk, Delhi. They together give you a nice enjoyable fun ride in the theaters with some predictable but still funny realistic stuff which more or less keeps you engaged. Particularly the film never lets you down in the first half but in the second it does have a drop in the pace and drags. Yet, after watching its superb emotional climax you don't mind its minor drawbacks and just want to remember the movie with a smile.However the fact remains that CHALO DILLI lifts its main plot and many of its major initial sequences, all from the English Hit "PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES" released in 1987. To be specific, the part played by Steve Martin in the Original is played by Lara Dutta in the Hindi version and the role of John Candy is played by Vinay Pathak. In a very silly and childish manner, the film starts exactly with the same sequence as seen in the English flick where in a corporate meeting the boss is trying to select an advertisement campaign for his product. And then till the next few reels the film blindly follows its inspiration without any major changes. For instance, Lara getting late for her flight, the first meeting of the couple in the traffic jam, the change in flight schedules, Lara deciding to go by budget class, they both meeting again in the plane, the plane landing at a different destination due to some problem (Jaipur instead of Delhi), Lara taking a taxi for Delhi and then they both sharing the same taxi incidentally on their way to Delhi. Everything is taken as it is from PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES. Interestingly another recently released English film titled DUE DATE (2010) also is said to be based on this Steve Martin's movie too.So, where it doesn't excite me to write about CHALO DILLI anymore due to its Copied status, at the same time I am also willing to praise its highly impressive climax which will be both shocking as well as enlightening for all the viewers with a rightly pumping heart in their bodies. In fact the final part of the film has a power to transform even the coldest heart in the theater and I am always a little biased with movies having that kind of power of changing a person in them. So, if you are game for such life-inspiring content then do watch it for sure. Director Shashant Shah uses many close to real life instances in the film perfectly. Like the sequence of the couple's early journey by taxi having a sleepy driver, a late night dinner at the road side Dhaba, their ticket less journey in the train, their stay in the weird Red Tomato Palace and few more. He also uses Delhi and its reference to build up a north Indian ambiance effectively (as the capital is at present the hot favourite spot for all Bollywood film-makers). But I only wish Shashant had not copied the overall concept of his film blatantly from the one mentioned above and had cleared his name from such uncreative controversy.The film purely depends upon the refreshing performances of its two lead characters Lara Dutta and Vinay Pathak who alone make the project watchable and entertaining. Lara shows another side of her talent and that's her excellent comic timing evidently visible in this film. She is simply great along with the amazing Vinay Pathak who has become a pro in acting for such kind of roles (though a little repetitive too). He is really superb as the Old Delhi shop-keeper and I truly loved him in the last 10 minutes of the film. In the supporting cast Brijendra Kala as the TC is the best and Akshay Kumar looks cool in his climax cameo. The film doesn't have any great songs and the Cinematography is also just fine. But it's the light mood of the film which wins you over in the end and you really don't mind spending your money and time on this enjoyable ride.As an undisclosed inspired or copied movie, as always I am not willing to vouch for CHALO DILLI. But only because it has got something which can bring up a positive change in a person's attitude towards life.I would like to recommend it to all my readers for this weekend. Go have a nice entertaining ride with the charming Lara and the witty Vinay saying CHALO DILLI." 
" A descent entertainer from the start till the end.","This is the first venture of Lara Dutta as a producer (She looks dead- drop gorgeous in the movie). The so called road movie is inspired from many English flicks like "Changing Lanes" and many more. So the movie, frankly is not original unlike the last venture of director Dasvidaniya.This is a kind of movie which is better to be enjoyed on weekends on DVD players.A good entertainer with its own loop holes (and huge loop holes).The best thing about the movie is its star cast.Vinay is witty and Lara is a chick!Cameo by a superstar is good!The movie fails to focus on any one track and keeps on struggling to catch your attention. Film starts well but falls flat by the interval and is never picked up.The humor quotient much needed for a road movie is less.Editing is poor. Cinematography is brilliant. Nikos Andritsakis has successfully captured spices of Rajasthan and Delhi.Challo Dilli never tries to be out of the box or extravagant. The movie remains a descent entertainer from the start till the end.Overall an above average movie." 
" Zigzag Road To Delhi","After the beautiful 'Dasvidaniya', Shashant Shah is back with Vinay Pathak in 'Chalo Dilli'. It's a road movie about two strangers who almost have nothing in common are brought by 'circumstances' to travel together as they head towards Delhi. The plot may sound very familiar as movies like 'Leap Year', 'Jab We Bet', 'Forces of Nature', 'Mr. & Mrs. Iyer' etc pop up in mind.However, I found it to be quite refreshing. The interactions between Lara's Mihika and Vinay's Manu very amusing. The humour works effectively. The clash in their personalities and the funny situations that make their journey more of a disaster, are hilariously depicted. I'm glad the writer didn't choose a clichéd path by allowing the characters to have romantic feelings for one another. I also enjoyed the references it makes to movies like 'Dilwale Dulhania LeJayenge', 'Mr. & Mrs. Iyer' among many others. The Indian locations look authentic and appealing. All the songs, with the exception of the item number, have been utilized efficiently.I have always thought of Lara Dutta who's an average actress at best until now. She really excels in 'Chalo Dilli' and shows how much she's grown as an actress. She nails the part completely. I also admire that she produced the film. I hope she continues doing this kind of work and does not go back to being a showpiece or a bimbo like in most of her previous movies. As for Vinay Pathak, this kind of role isn't anything new. He's had plenty of practice and of course the result is more than sufficient. Akshay Kumar is good in an extended cameo.On the flip side, I felt that the item number wasn't necessary at all. I found the ending a little melodramatic. At certain points the film almost loses track.Shashant Shah's 'Dasvidaniya' remains one of my favourites but I found 'Chalo Dilli' very enjoyable too. With Vinay and Lara's comic banter, there's enough to keep one amused." 
" Clean & Funny Journey.","Lara Dutta, is a fine actress, but not seen much other than few bit parts. I guess she is cursed with good looks, good diction with Hindi and English alike, as compared to the "Katrina Types". She gets struck with a paan-chewing lower middle class Manu Gupta (Vinay Pathak) who is too elated to be seen with this woman. Lara Dutta's character leads a lifestyle that of a "Leona Hemsley Type" who invariably abuse and curse any one and everyone in sight and has general disdain for the mankind except for her husband Vikram (Akshay Kumar, who has smile of a cheshire cat, good looks and not much in the acting department) who appears as Rama, rescuing his Sita from the clutches of Ravan and Rakshsasa's (the driver and occupants of the jeep-if we have to let run our imagination back to the scriptures). Her trip to Dilli, takes a few major and several minor detours, that the journey could be an expose of "Incredible India" as touted in the tourism flyers. It unfolds the Indian rural life, that only locals and stranded alike experience. It's amazing that just two actors can sustain the length of the film. The scene from the police station to the motel, is below the good movie mark, but if one has the patience and perseverance, they are in for a treat, since the last scene is plainly heart-breaking and the subtitles explain the cure for several ills of the society. The movie is enjoyable and riveting with a hint of mystery to the story-the mystery is, what is next? for this single and sophisticated woman traveler, who seems to be clearly-out of place-to the rural folks and viewers alike!" 
" "Do not judge people by face value.... Including yourself".",""The road of life twists and turns and no two directions are ever the same. Yet our lessons come from the journey, not the destination."Chalo Dilli is a road trip movie, and like all such movies, is centered around two totally unlike strangers who are forced to make a trip together to reach their common destination.A bizarre journey full of adventure, madness and crazy comic moments with the oddest traveling couple ever!! (Lara Dutta travels in airplanes, while Vinay Pathak prefers General Class Rail journey...She smokes Virginia Slims, he chews Gopal Zarda !!)Through the process in Chalo Dilli, one comes across some real people who teach you some truths of life. Director Shashant Shah has successfully directed a clean comedy (Chalo Dilli), which is not mindless and slapstick.Actors have played their part to perfection with special reference to Vinay Pathak and Lara Dutta.Though the film is real and hits the right note, there are a few loop holes that comes out clearly. There were a few flat moments in Chalo Dilli, that could have been avoided. Probably, a more crisp and tight writing would have resulted in a more impactive climax.Over all, Chalo Dilli is an exciting and amusing watch, with terrific moments. If you are looking for a decent light watch, with Indian touch, then Chalo Dilli is something that you can't afford to miss." 
" An Unusual-yet-Enjoyable Journey of Two Contrasting Personalities!","An unusual tale, far away from usual bollywood "love-stories of Hero and his beloved Heroine, Chalo Dilli is a different journey of two persons who are on the opposite extremes! Mika Banerjee (Lara Dutta) and Manu Gupta (Vinay Pathak) are the unlikely pair who are caught together in a strange situation and have to exchange dialogues and get along with each other as they become the only known soul for each other in their unusual route to Delhi. Mika Banerjee is the elite, independent women, Senior Vice President of a 200-crore company having a sophisticated planned life-style. On the other extreme, Manu Gupta is carefree, friendly and happy-go-lucky saree shop owner from Karol Bagh, Delhi, not equipped with "elite-class etiquettes". Vinay Pathak, with his unique style of acting will again make you giggle, laugh, smirk and cry all together! Lara Dutta also fits into the role as the sexy and confident working woman . Both the lead characters of the movie are the commonly found ones but these two extreme personalities coming together through dramatic sequences is what brings the humor and charm in the plot. The less-taken road which they shared via dingy 'Dhaba', ticket-less train journey and a lot other exciting things is refreshing and will give you a reason to maintain a smile on your face throughout while you sit back relaxed in your seat and enjoy it till the end! The movie leaves you with a beautiful message, from the "Kon si Badi Baat ho gayi" attitude of Manu Gupta whenever he finds himself in a problematic situation. Watch it and you won't realize when the clock went in circle twice. Bonus! You'd be left with a preciously beautiful message with a smile on your face and moist eyes!" 
" A Passable Fare..","'Chalo Dilli' , Directed by Shashant Shah, is A Passable Fare, that offers some nice moments in the goings-on, that manage to hold your interest. And even the performances, by Vinay Pathak & Lara Dutta, are up-to the mark!'Chalo Dilli' Synopsis: Enroute to her destination via plane, a busy executive gets stranded with a middle-classed fast-talking male.'Chalo Dilli' works in parts and comes across as a decent one-time watch. Being a Road-Movie, the film offers some nice moments, that genuinely hold your interest. However, after a winning first-hour, the film falters in it's second-hour, that is slightly longer than it should have been. The Screenplay by Arshad Sayed works nicely in the first-hour, but post-interval, it gets a bit dragging. Shashant Shah's Direction is fair. Cinematography & Editing, are satisfactory. Performance-Wise: Vinay Pathak & Lara Dutta deliver impressive performances. And even their on-screen chemistry, is interesting. Akshay Kumar scores in a brief role. Brijendra Kala & Gaurav Gera support well. On the whole, 'Chalo Dilli' is a decent watch." 
" Vinay pathak : Badass | Awesome acting","Best Comedy movie. Love the acting of vinay and lara. Great scenes. i loved the whole movie scenes except the scenes when gujjar singh enter in the movie. All the dialogue which is delivered by gujjar was rubbish (double meaning). I really enjoyed watching this movie. And the last scene was awesome that taught me how to handle tough situation "To koun si badi baat ho gayi". Must watch this movie with family." 
" Spoiler","Saw 'Chalo Dilli' today. Nice start as usual Vinay Pathak in a typical Chandani Chowk wala style brings smile on everybody's face. Some nice jokes and funny one liners in the starting but later on the plot went weak and weaker. Incidents seemed unnecessarily added. Comedy was being forced. Lara Datta has started looking old. Heavy make-up was quite visible. Her work was OK OK. At some places she did a good job n at some over acting. Vinay Pathak who is extremely talented for such roles, did justice with his job but he did not have the content.Item song which already gathered some popularity with the controversy was not in the story line at all and does not seem to be doing any magic in Munni and Sheela's era.Story says Lara is a high profile business woman going Delhi, somehow misses her flight and goes by road with Vinay Pathak.Going to wrong places, taking rides from strangers, trying to appreciate the cultural diversity of India did not work that well.We also have a guest appearance in the role Lara's macho husband. He also failed to gather any clap.Last half an hour was like eternal, movie ended so many times before THE END. Just want to say do not have your hopes very high because you have seen Vinay in some amazing roles. If you are a fan you can watch just once." 
" Ab Dilli Door Nahi....","Vinay Pathak has carved a niche for him. Regardless of the box-office fate of his movies, the fan-base will continue to patronise his films for the simple reason that as a performer he never lets you down. The same can be said for "Chalo Dilli", his cent percent shines above all. The character not quite irritating if they are expecting another "Bheja Fry" but does bear a slight resemblance. The plot is interesting, a road movie. The narrative does take a beating at few places especially when they hitch a ride after the jail-break. Instead a few funny moments could have been thrown in. And yes, the penultimate moments are an absolute tear-jerker. The Yana Gupta item song is clearly a force-fit and on that note the "Laila Main Laila" remix is an absolute letdown. Lara Dutta gets into the skin of the character as a suave corporate lady who can make things happen. The tag of home-production gives her additional incentive to push the envelope. Akshay Kumar in an extended cameo does a good job.The "Dasvidaniya" director delivers yet another a fun-filled feel-good movie thats worth a go." 
" Incomplete funny journey of "Bahan Ji and Bhai Sahab"","On journey from Mumbai to Delhi Bahan Ji (Lara Dutt)meet Bhai Sahab (Vinay Pathak)only because of their flight takes off in Jaipur instead of Delhi.It would be sufficient to call them Bahan Ji and Bhai Sahab because during whole journey they don't even know what are their names.OF-course once Mihika(Bhan Ji)say that"by which angle I am looking like Bahan Ji?"Mihika is a high profile lady and president of a company is traveling with a Delhi based funny guy for whom every task is like "What's the big deal" through the villages of Rajasthan.Obviously when a high profile lady is traveling with a middle class person then the activities are happening between them would be irritating for high profile lady and funny for audience.Actually their are more than half movie scenes which don't seen funny except some scenes like dining fart scene in a Dhaba and hotel room scene.Vinay Pathak has done great comic work just like Bheja fry irritating guy for which watching movie doesn't seem time pass.The final scene is heart touching scene of movie which explain why Vinay Pathak say "What's the big deal?".However it's a watchable movie and doesn't seem waste of money." 
" Could have had a stronger second half","Chalo Dilli directed by Shashant Shah is mediocre.The story is good.The screenplay is well penned.But a stronger second half could have made the movie a good watch.The music is okay.The dialogs are good.The cinematography is great.Performances-Vinay Patahak,as usual is excellent.Lara Dutta is good too.Akshay Kumar in special appearance is okay.On the whole,Chalo Dilli needed a stronger second half!"
