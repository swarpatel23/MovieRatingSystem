" Akki Singh is the real King!","'Balle balle te shava shava!' 'Oye! Chak De Phatte!' This is what you will hear loud and clear while watching this movie through out. 'Singh is Kinng' is a true example of how you package the ordinary idea with loads of no-logic but damn funny humor, jazzed up with some peppy nos, put a big tag of superstar and wrap it up with oodles of hype. This movie has created history in breaking all time box office records specially. The mass hysteria of Akshay Kumar is unstoppable. He is the next big thing and currently, Indian movie industry is betting more than Rs 150 crores on him. The story of 'Singh is Kinng' is simple. Akki is a panic button for his village. People are so bugged with his non-sense that they decided to send him out of the village. They some how emotionally convinced him to go abroad and bring back another son of soil who is now an underworld don. Om Puri also got tagged along with Akki in this journey. In between, he meets his love interest Katrina and what follows is a no sense roller coaster ride where not only he has to bring the village son back to his roots but also, win his girl's heart.It might sound nothing great then how come its such a big hit breaking all overseas records? The answer lies in two powerful words- Akki and the music. Akki aka Akhay Kumar is the current king of Bollywood. He is power packed and Singh is Kinng is a true example to prove it. He'd hold the front all alone with his witty performance. Katrina too has her moments but just moments. Kiran Kher is a sheer waste of talent. Om Puri is just fine and Ranvir Shorey is something i don't even want to talk about it. What a waste of talent. Javed Jaffery is funny and played an interesting character. This movie is not focused on building characters because it can only happen with a good script. But here it's not about script but Akki and only Akki.Music is really nice and has lots of variety. Pritam has done it again and has given another super hit soundtrack. 'Teri Or' is a surprise delight with beautiful vocals, music and video. The reason why I like this song is not just the melody but an add on of some Rajasthani folk song playing in the background. Another interesting song is 'Jee Karda'. Solid Punjabi beats forcing you to break free and just dance. It's extremely catchy. The title track could've been better if they've got some other singer than Mika. He did a horrible job. Snoop Dogg did his first act in Bollywood singing the remix version of title song which is way better than the original. Another very interesting song is 'Bhutani Ke' which is very funny. It's a leg pulling song for the groom at his marriage. I can imagine this song getting played at every marriage and grooms just getting embarrassed.It's an interesting movie and I advise every one to go with their group of friends and you'll be coming out laughing from the movie halls. Akshay has reached a status where he should take movies where he gets a support from a good script and some less silly things to be seen in the movie. Apart from this, i don't thing any other reason why you should not and go watch this full time pass movie." 
" Stupid Entertainer","Singh is Kinng,directed by Anees Bazmee has no story basically.But this one could be called a Kinng sized entertainer. It offers loads of big laughs,some action sequences,a little drama and lots of romance and last but not the least it has the biggest entertainer of Bollywood-Akshay Kumar. Direction by Anees Bazmee is excellent. The music is chart buster with all songs topping. The Cinematagropher has done a excellent job.The scenic beauty of Australia has been captured very well. Special mention to the dialogs writer who does an amazing job. Performance wise-Akshay Kumar is the Daddy of Entertainment.He simply rocks!Katrina Kaif adds glamor value to the film.Om Puri and Kirron Kher are superb in their respective roles.Sonu Sood is very good.Neha Dhupia looks gorgeous.Javed Jaffery is excellent.Ranvir Shorey is okay in a brief role.Yashpal Sharma,Sudhanshu Pandey,Kamal Chopra and Manoj Pahwa are good.Overall Singh is Kinng is an entertainer." 
" Just a slapstick comedy, Akshay ensures that it doesn’t bore you!","Akshay Kumar has steadily established himself well as a bankable comedy star. Most of his recent movies; be it Welcome, Bhool Bhulaiyaa or its likes have less to with brains and more with goofy stuff. Not to say that I’m against no-brainers; note, flicks like these are tailor made for box-office performance! Who, except for hapless multiplex audience paying 200 bucks to watch it, would really care whether it makes sane sense! Singh is King is one such movie off the comic assembly line! Akshay plays his usual Machismo, this time a Punjabi Munda, Happy Singh. The villagers love his innocence but are irritated by the damage he causes uncannily. Soon, they find a pretext to get him out of the village, to bring back a crime boss ‘King’ Lucky Singh (Sonu Sood) who the villagers feel has tarnished the repute of their village and their ethnic group.A comedy of errors lands Happy and his buddy (Om Puri) in Egypt instead of Australia, where he bumps into a damsel Sonia (Katrina Kaif) and is instantly smitten. The story moves to Australia where the duo discover that the ‘King’ is in no mood to return to his village. A series of events leads to the king getting injured and going into Coma. As he passes out, he points at Happy. The gang takes it that Lucky has chosen his successor.Just as happy sets out to do good to a world of evil Lucky controlled, Sonia returns engaged, our hero is heartbroken. But he’s still at his comic best with full scale Sardar bravado! Then, there are the usual dream sequences, bhangda dance numbers and goofy humor that may hardly tickle you. But, what does this movie have that makes it tick? Akshay! As much as you find the script stupid, you’ll adore Happy Singh!Although this flick is one of those run of the mill movies which you may never remember later, you may still find it worthwhile to watch it on cheap tickets. Reasons, the lead star rocks, the dance number Jee Karda in Egypt is neat. Katrina is the usual eye candy. As for the rest, Javed Jaffery, Kirron Kher, Om Puri, Neha Dhupia and Ranvir Shorey are nothing awesome, but they don’t bore you. My bet, try it out, albeit with low expectations!" 
" !!!Singh is Kinng!!!King of Kings!!!","This film lived up to its heights. This film has everything, Comedy, Thriller,Action,Drama,Romance.....this film is not for those critics and those who want to judge every small detail.This movie is all about having fun and enjoying yourself.This movie gets you hooked in the first 15 minutes and thats what makes it great. All the actors where great except Katerina Kaif.She barely cant speak Hindi and her acting was horrible. Akshay,Sonu,Om... were great and knew some Punjabi which made the movie a good Hindi and little bit of Punjabi film.The plot was good. The songs were great especially Bas Ek King,Jee Karda,Singh is King and the comedy song Bhoot Ni Ke. I give this movie a 10/10.When punjabi's are in the house, you know its going to be great.Singh is king.!!!!!!!!!!MUST WATCH FILM!!!!!GREAT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!!!!" 
" Someone Kill Me!","If I met Taran Adarsh right now, I would beg him never to review a movie again. He went ahead and gave this 4/5 on IndiaFM. He said, leave your brain at home and enjoy this exhilarating ride. I should have left my ears and eyes at home as well. This has to be the worst movie that I have ever watched, it is even worse that Welcome (which was written by the same guy and was a very big blockbuster, but as far as I am concerned was completely nonsensical). I do not what were the makers thinking when they made this movie. The writer must have been on drugs when he wrote this piece of crap. The story is paper thin, the plot is stupidly predictable. There is not even one moment in the film where something you do not expect happens. Hell, we have seen this all before. You do not even have to listen to the dialogues because they are insanely predictable. And to top it all, it is supposed to be a comedy, I could not manage a single laugh in two and a half hours. By the end of it, I just wanted to bang my head against a wall, it was unbearable. Where was the fun that you promised, Mr. Adarsh. The acting, quite bearable. Music, quite good actually. But a couple of songs are too forced to be acceptable. On the whole, it as a total no no. If you really want to see this and think you have nothing better to do for three hours, trust me you have. Get some sleep if you have really nothing else to do, I am sure that your bed is more comfortable than the cinema hall for a quite nap. Please do yourself a favour and do not watch this nonsense." 
" Singh Is Kinng!","Amazing movie, full of comedy and cheesy action :] Akshay doesn't fail to impress, his look as a Punjabi jatt is priceless. Katrina looks beautiful and does her part very well, except for a couple of overdone scenes. I love all of the clothes, especially the different colored pagadi/turban's. The songs are fantastic and not too long. Teri Ore, Jee Karda, Bas Ek Kinng and Singh Is Kinng are notable. The storyline is interesting and simple, yet entertaining. Definitely worth the watch for any age! The ending song, Singh Is Kinng, is a cherry on top as it features both Snoop Dogg and Akshay Kumar. The theater went wild the moment that song came on! Fun and entertaining, a must watch!" 
" Great Entertainment","I am having great difficulty understanding the number of reviewers who claim that you have to leave your brain at home to watch Singh is Kinng. I can't for the life of me remember one Indian film that has mentally engaged me - EVER. The simple fact of the matter is that Indian cinema is all about pure escapism and the key here is entertainment. The majority of cinema-goers in India are largely illiterate and enjoy what are essentially masala films. On that basis alone it would be pathetic to offer them something along the lines of 2001 A Space Odyssey  much like offering caviar to a pallet that is accustomed to pav bhaji. Right, now I've got that off my chest I'll continue with my opinion on Singh is Kinng. If you go with the right attitude i.e. you  have  watched  Indian  films  before  and  know  what  to  expect, then what you will get is a greatly entertaining film with hilarious comic situations. Anees Bazmee is known for making entertaining films and has a great track record in making successful Bollywood films such as No Entry and Welcome. For me Singh is Kinng exceeds the aforementioned films as the humour and wit comes a lot thicker and faster and the tone is far more superior to films of a similar nature, i.e. David Dhawan films. Akshay Kumar is superb and does an excellent job. He really brings a great energy to the screen and delivers a spirited performance as Happy Singh. Katrina Kaif does what she does best  look good  and she certainly does look breathtaking as usual. Om Puri, Kirron Kher, Sonu Sood, Javed Jafri, Neha Dupia and all the other supporting cast play their parts very well. In fact this is one of the first films in a long time where all the supporting cast get good screen time and have well rounded characters. They really add to the story progression and events. I won't really tell you anything about the story  in fact there is very little to say. Like many other great entertainers there isn't much of a storyline. It's just fast paced fun and action. In short, Singh is Kinng has all the necessary ingredients for a good night out at the cinema. A fast paced storyline, a great star cast, excellent production values, good songs and laugh out loud comedy. So go and enjoy it and don't forget to take your brain along!" 
" Pure unadulterated fun !!","Just came back from preview screening of this movie. Its a Hilarious Comedy, we were literally in fits due to laughter. Akshay Kumar steals the show, nothing unexpected. But from the time he makes an entry, you know this is going to be one roller coaster ride. And he is supported very well by rest of the cast, however Katrina Kaif is there doing what she does the best, look good. She has nothing much to do in the movie. But I feel that this could have been a much better movie, the title of the movie had lot more potential, however I was not expecting much from Anees Bazmee. But yes, if you love Akshay Kumar, and do not might couple of hours of side splitting comedy, then go for it.." 
" Same old anees bazmee entertainer with a sikh twist....","A typical anees bazmee film, nothing special, yeah entertaining but still you can make out the touches of welcome and no entry when it comes to the comedy and entertainment. Good entertainment for the typical Indian b-grade comedy lovers.Watch it for time pass..Nothing extraordinary.Akshay Kumar again seen in a comedy film has done well but he is kind of getting stereotypic.Om Puri did well but then again the story line doesn't contain anything unpredictable with the same romantic and action sequences mixed and the same old happy ending with akshay and katrina finally meeting each other. Katrina is nothing but an extra addition to the movie.All in all, Not very special...I will only recommend it for good time pass but nothing more than that." 
" Audience clap when they see the movie ...but they clap their hands over their eyes","Story/ Screenplay/ Script:: Long story short - its gone to dogs. End result, the movie is "all form - no beer".This movie is an another example to prove that star-power coupled with marketing can set the cash register on fire (mini-me of Om Shanti Om?). Overseas I am sure, it has raked moolah in loads. Akki proves that he is second to none when it comes to punching above one's weight. Akki-Katrina:: Undoubtedly, they share a sizzling chemistry.Om Puri/ Kiron Kher/ Ranvir Shorey:: These names are synonymous with "powerhouse of talent". It would be an "understatement" to mention that they were grossly under-utilised.Javed Jaffery:: Why Javed why? Vipul:: You were fantastic as a director in "Namaste London", why on earth did you hand over the reigns? Anees Bazmi:: Suggest you go back to writing or follow Priyan's footsteps (of remaking South movies viz. "No Entry"). Needless to say, it would be blessing to the audience." 
" A heartbreakingly great movie","Yes, it's that good. Behind the flashy slick visuals a story of big heart and adventurous love unfolds. A story that changes everybody engaged. Changes for the better.Like the other Indian comedy, which I witnessed not so long ago ("Money Hai"), this one is marvellous. It starts with crazy atmosphere (some serious gangsters are having a party and during their funny talks a tough and very lively hit-man jumps out of the big cake and starts shooting in all directions) that never stops It's got so many hysterically funny scenes and innuendoes that no contemporary Hollywood comedy can beat it (at least from what I've seen). Like the one where a gangster puts on a triple mask and each mask gets a punch during a funny "karate" brawl scene You can easily enjoy it all together with your whole family - no one will be offended (a rare feature these days).It's very recommended if you enjoy good bright and clever modern comedies. It has more moral lessons than any drama I've seen in years, if you can notice them (I'll not spoil it by pointing them out here).This is a 10 out of 10 - big respect to India. Thank you for attention." 
" Worse than Tashan","Welcome director Anees Bazmee once again teams up with Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif for this ridiculous comedy. The story revolves around a small-town Sikh boy called Happy Singh who becomes an underworld don by mistake. The film is set predominantly in Australia and 2 songs in Egypt. It was promoted really well before the release and promised to entertain and make the audience laugh throughout which it failed to do. Bollywood comedies usually turn out to be really funny or really annoying and Singh is Kinng is really annoying. All the fans of Bollywood slapstick comedies (yes there are a lot of you out there) will probably like it.Tashan was a rubbish movie but a few jokes and Anil Kapoor's bad English was funny but Singh is Kinng was absolutely not funny. There is a difference between comedies that require no brains and brainless comedies. The whole movie is dodgy and lacks a single decent joke. Except Akshay Kumar the whole cast couldn't act especially Katrina Kaif who does not even know the ABC of acting. The ending was so bad and stupid that I felt like taking my shoe off & throwing it on the screen.The Music is also really good and the best songs are Bas Ek King & Jee Karda. Overall it is the kind of movie that will make you leave the cinema hall with a red face and sing Stupid Kinng all the way home." 
" Complete value for money","Fultoo entertainment...not a single sad moment....after a long time we are treated with a hilarious movie....much much better than previous Akki duds like welcome and hey baby....Akki plays his part really well...but the film belongs to the entire cast and not just Akshay....be it Katrina (boy...she is too gorgeous), Manoj Pahwa (very cute), Om Puri (mind blowing), Yashpal Sharma (very funny), Neha Dhupia (complete revelation..man she can act!!), Javed Jaffry (sure to bring the house down)..Teri Ore is shot really well and Katrina looks stunning in black sari....the combo of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Shreya is terrific....there are many scenes which u will remember for a long time....music suits the film....word of advice: keep your brains at home....move aside David Dhawan....Anees has replaced u as the comedy king...." 
" Singh is Boring","Wake up Bollywood. Loudness and Comedy are not the same. Singh is King (or kinng, for god's sake) is one such terrible attempt at comedy which desperately tries to be funny but ends up being a loud and unfunny movie.Akshay Kumar is the saving grace and acts well so does Javed Jeffrey. Om puri is miscast, Katrina is only for songs, Ranvir and Kiron Kher are wasted and Neha Dhupia appeared to be forcibly cast.Comedy is less. 'Attempt at comedy' is more and that's where Singh is Kinng fails. 'Anything goes' is the mantra when it comes to comedy films these days in Bollywood. Either the movie makers simply copy the story from a hit Hollywood flick or simply write a crappy story themselves and make a movie. They are intelligent enough to know that People in India only come to cinemas when there's a brilliant star cast. What's actually in the movie is a secondary affair.Ever wondered why there's not a writer's strike in bollywood?" 
" uncontrolled..uninterrupted fun","this movie has just one word for it and its "FUN". this is the first one since bheja fry that i have seen which had me laughing throughout. I didn't like Welcome and i still think that it was too much hype and no plot at all but i cant say the same about this one.The story is about a villager Happy Singh who wants to help people but ends up troubling them. Happy Singh is sent to Australia to bring back lucky singh who is from the same village and a don in Australia. In the end happy manages to show light to Lucky singh and all his accomplices and cause a change of heart.Forget the plot, the script, the other actors and there is just one real thing...akshaye kumar. His performance, punjabi accent, the dialogues and body language will keep u laughing throughout. The movie has no dull moment This is a one man show although he's got a great support from om puri, kiron kher and the rest of cast. The music is smashing and has great visuals too. Katrina looks gorgeous and the movie has all the makings of a great entertainer.Go and enjoy....the movie is hilarious and so is akshaye kumar." 
" Everyone except Akshay disappoints. Nice songs but a complete mess","Akshay Kumar tries his best and occasionally breathes life into 'Singh Is Kinng'. The film is a complete mess. It has such a horrendous beginning that I almost felt I had entered the wrong theater. Akshay then enters and despite the corny jokes, manages to hold our attention. There are some catchy musical numbers. However, the plot is simply too weak and everybody else looks bored. Om Puri and Ranvir Shorey are both VERY disappointing. Katrina Kaif tries to act but doesn't succeed. The ending descends into mawkish melodrama and becomes preachy. The film is best seen at home with ample use of the FF button.Overall 3/10"
