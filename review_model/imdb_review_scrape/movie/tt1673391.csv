" A refreshingly simple movie","Rajpal Yadav plays Lallan, a dutiful senior security guard, who is in love with Saroja, a beautiful girl from his native village. Lallan is employed in Mumbai and regularly makes calls to his village to know the whereabouts of Saroja. He has a good friend in auto-driver Ganesh, in his boss-in-office Tiwari Chacha, in Gujarati groceress Hansaben and in RJ Anurag Pandey. He is in cordial terms with his colleagues. He frequently discusses his trivial troubles with Tiwari Chacha and seeks advice from him. After her exams are over, Saroja is due to be wedded to a stranger, 20 years senior to her, to the total ignorance of Lallan. Lallan comes to know of this through Pappu, a teenage kid, and Gitti, Saroja's friend. The marriage has been settled by Saroja's father on the assurance from the groom's end that he will receive a sum of 2 lac rupees which is meant to aid Saroja's brother Gabbu in fetching a job. While announcing her marriage over phone, Saroja mentions that she loves Kishan, jeweller Lachhmidas' son and wishes to marry him instead. This comes as a shock to Lallan, however, he commits himself to accomplish her wish for which he must arrange a sum of 2 lac rupees to be given to Saroja's father. Lallan goes through a lot of hassles in procuring the sum and then protecting it during his journey to his village, but overcomes everything by the grace of God. Eventually, Saroja comes to know through Gitti that Lallan loves her and he has taken so much trouble to fulfill her wish. She finds his sacrifice much superior to Kishan's care towards her which is next to null. She declares that she will marry Lallan who faints at this news. Thereafter Lallan and Saroja get married and Lachhmidas blesses the couple at the wedding while Tiwari promises to receive them in Mumbai."
