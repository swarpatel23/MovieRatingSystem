" Disgrace to Indian cinema!","I can't believe people actually gave this movie 9 stars!!! Somebody even called it "nothing short of outstanding". That's true! It truly is standing out in stupidity. Let's admit it, SRK does not know how to act funny. Why should he try again and again to prove that wrong? SRK cannot do a Mahmood! Corny punch dialogues, a ridiculously untrue version of how a Tamilian talks and an absolutely nonsensical 'khichdi' story line are the highlights of Chennai Express. Deepika Padukone is kind of okay, but the rest of the star cast make a fool of themselves especially Nikitin Dheer as Thangbali. Imagine a leader in a village in Tamil Nadu, who speaks broken Tamil. the worst scene is towards the end when SRK and Deepika eye the hatchet and do a song sequence which includes Thangabali's henchmen. The most apt review that I read in any website or media site is Mayank Shekhar's review in the Dainik Bhaskar "You've paid for the ticket? Yes. Now just sit back and suffer."." 
" Boring","This Movie is really Boring.. Even though first Half is better and entertaining, movie eventually becomes so irritating after interval. My rating is 1 out of 10. Deepika's acting is good, but so many unwanted drama scenes are inserted in the movie.. which makes it a headache. Story is not that much interesting, and could be completed within 1 Hour and 50 Minutes. But No...!! Rohit Shetty pulled it with boring dialogs and drama scenes. Songs starts when they are undoubtedly NOT REQUIRED. there is a part in movie when there are 2 songs in 15 minutes of interval. Ending fight is too long to tolerate. and finally, movie ends in a DDLJ style, which is the most predictable from the maker of the movie.." 
" IMDb , please add 0 * option for the movies like this","First of all , Overacting , Overacting and again Overacting by srk .Previously , my thoughts were only salman khan do mindless flicks but now srk is also added to that list along with akshay kumar (For joker to Ouatimd) The PLOT was absolutely nothing and half of the dialogues were in tamil , aahhhh I don't know when rohit shetty will return of making good movies , the last time it was golmaal (2006) My suggestion , if you have watched Joker , Bodyguard etc and you hated it , don't watch this and if you've loved it , then also don't watch it Both OUATIMD and chennai disappointed us , lets wait and cross our fingers for Satyagrah Rating :- 01/10" 
" Stupid mindless movie, giving a 1 star would be overrating","I don't know how this movie managed to get the rating it has currently, but I can describe this movie easily in just one word - 'Disastrous' But what is really wrong with the movie? Simple answer-'Everything'. Right from the beginning, the movie strives to appeal to the audience through its ridiculous and irrational humor. The movie has tried an approach of comedy through modification of old hit songs to use it as communication and fails miserably at achieving its target (assuming its target was to amuse the audience and not to be vexatious). Leaving out Deepika Padukone, the other characters start with a complete Tamil comprehension and gradually we find everyone can speak Hindi or English whenever they feel like. If the aspect of acting was to be examined, it was not difficult to conclude that both the stars were overacting and if anyone was doing his job well it was Mukesh Tiwari (which too was not very engaging). On another note, it would not be wrong to categorize Chennai Express as a Tamil movie taking into consideration that more than half the movie is Tamil and for the rest someone is acting as an interpreter. The language issue does not end here; the songs are mix of Hindi and Tamil which are hard to comprehend. Other songs which are recognizable felt drab and lack any meaningful lyrics with one or two exceptions which hardly compensate the negative subjects of the movie.Unfortunately, I had to give a rating of 1 star to this movie because it isn't possible to give a zero. Rather in my opinion, this movie deserves a negative and could without a hitch serve as a benchmark for the worst movies made in Bollywood." 
" Brainless Action Flick By SRK","In tandem with the current trend of commercialization of the Hindi film industry, SRK has now released a movie which is about to make it to the so called 100 crore rupees club albeit it does not deserve even 10%. What it earns is only because of the publicity and marketing gimmicks by the superstar who hopes that people should worship him like the Tamil and Telgu movie stars. The movie has a very limited story which can be explained in a minute. There are no twists. Blatant advertising is used to increase revenue. Cinematography is good but with cheap script and acting make it fall in the shadows. The entire movie is based on SRK and dipika who entirely occupy the screen space. The songs have the most mindless lyrics and numbing tunes which are easily forgotten. The most unfortunate thing is to see an aging superstar who had produced great pieces of acting in his early days resort to promoting his own acting in a film which has no original acting. Watching the movie in theater is a waste of money..." 
" It is beyond belief how this movie got good reviews","I wonder how can this movie be the top revenue grosser in India ?! I doubt that Indian audience is so crazy for a bad story, badly acted , stereotypical formula movie on which they are splurging their hard earned money. This movie has to be one of the worst I have ever seen. It has absolutely no entertainment value.SRK is terrible in this movie, not that he has impressed me with his acting skills in any movie. Deepika Padukone is absolutely gorgeous, but, her performance in this movie lacks acting skills. Is it the director who does not bring out the best in her, or is it the Indian audience who just wants " Time Pass " movies with just a couple of beautiful faces, stupid story line and making fun of dwarfs!! OMG this is such a terrible movie and got such good reviews ! Probably the reviews are paid for as a marketing gimmick." 
" One of the worse movies I have ever seen.","I have no idea why this movie is getting such good ratings. The movie was a pain to watch, with a handful of original comic moments. Shah Rukh Khan did a pretty horrible job of acting. Its disappointing that this movie is doing so well in the box office. Seriously, where are Bollywood's standards. I understand this is supposed to be a comedy/drama movie, but come on. Oh well, its made by Rohit Shetty, could not have expected anything better. The direction is horrible, more of a Tamil/Tollywood movie than a Bollywood movie. Cars flying, hero beating the crap out of 20 guys at once, I guess that turns on the audience. VERY DISAPPOINTING MOVIE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY." 
" 3rd class movie","First of all I'm quite surprised that how this movie got 7.5 in IMDb. story : Same as typical Bollywood movies. There are no new in this story. Within 15 minutes you can guess the story properly. Cast :Deepika Padukone did excellent job in this movie. But I was expected little more from SRK. Director: Rohit sir did the same job like his other movies. But there was no room for comedy. There are few punch lines. Songs: Songs are good. Title and lungi dance are catchy. Cinematography : Cinematography was excellent. I really appreciate for this. Overall: If you want to see this movie then wait for just 1 month.Don't buy tickets for this kind of movie. If you are a sensible movie lover then you don't need to watch this movie in theater." 
" Chennai Express - Anything but Mindless","‎ChennaiExpress‬ - The movie delivered what promised and that is sheer ENTERTAINMENT. Since it was a Rohit Shetty movie, I entered the theater having a mindset of seeing those illogical stunts and gravity defying action, but I was really surprised to see a "toned" down Rohit Shetty in this movie. Yes there were few action scenes here and there, but it was not very "over the top" as was synonymous with a Shetty movie. For me, I will not tag it as a complete "no brainer mindless masala flick", as it surely isn't. Coming to acting, SRK's comic timing was impeccable even when he was hamming through the scenes, it was done with a purpose, but finally it was Deepika Padukone who stole the hearts with her endearing performance. And did I mention it was funny, rather hilarious at times. A complete Family Entertainer. Those who don't feel laughing their hearts out won't hurt their intellect, will surely love this movie" 
" Utter drivel","Will Rohit Shetty ever make a decent watchable movie? His other works of art include Bol Bacchan, Golmaal series but this one still manages to top the lot.The script would bore a five-year old. It has no depth whatsoever. The characters are totally mindless. Shah Rukh Khan is incapable of acting in a normal, believable role. His usual brand of hyperbole is starting to wear thin (apparently not with the average audience though).Deepika Padukone is the only saving grace.The movie doesn't even deserve the one star that I am forced to give it because of the IMDb rating system. I want my money and three hours back." 
" Just short of Outstanding !","Seeing Shah Rukh Khan in this kind of typical bollywood entertainer film is kinda surprising but let me tell you guys - he has done it !Rohit Shetty, the director, did a great job. He has always been known of this special genre of films in bollywood if I am not wrong and has lived up to the expectations in a 'better' way I would say.Music overall is a bit let down in the sense that bollywood audience love the singers' voice and flow of the song, not exactly the 'music' part of the songs. But technically this is really another best part of the movie and people will realize it while watching the movie. Songs fit with the situation and flow of the story.Nikiten, Sathyaraj and other supporting actors did lend a good support to the film and script.Deepika is just 'outstanding'. This is one movie where I would say that an actress went ahead of a male actor in overall performance. South Indian language, accent, expressions, confidence and of course the chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan - everything brilliant !I would go with 4.5/5" 
" Chennai Express, will be a well deserved entry in the 100 crore club!","Chennai express has everything going for it from the word PO!(Go in Tamil) I am a die hard Shahrukh fan and love Deepika too and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed at all!(though I had serious,serious doubts about the film till it actually began)The film is a laugh riot! Amazing comedy timing, carefully written script, beautifully shot and two absolutely BRILLIANT actors. Deepika in particular is exceptionally good! She does so well that Shahrukh is side lined in a number of scenes they have together! The support cast and background actors do a fab job too.A lot had been written and said about what is the need for Shahrukh to follow the others and be a part of another brainless action flick. But thats the difference, this one is miles away from one. No south film remake, no ridiculous flying fight scenes and the female lead actually HAD a role! I never thought the two of them could actually come together and make a one of a kind film, keeping the essence of the genres that each of them is famous for intact!An original Bollywood flick 'King Khan' and Rohit Shetty style. The music is extremely catchy and does complete justice to the film,not being too much, but just right.So a BIG thumbs up to Vishal-Shekhar!A good comedy after a long, long time. Shahrukh had said that he took up this movie only because he was in 'splits' when he heard the script. And he's right, the script is the hero and thats why everything else falls in place. There is logic to everything.If your a Shahrukh or Deepika fan, your're in for a treat! And the others, trust me, you will not be bored! :)So,get on the train baby!And, for the record, this film does not show any of the community in bad light or try to ridicule a south Indian as it was assumed initially by a lot of people as Deepika was required to do a south accent. I agree its not completely authentic but the dialogues are so good that the different accents is just to portray the cultural difference. Me, being a part north Indian and part south Indian did not feel humiliated but enjoyed every little bit. :)" 
" Fun-rolled Masala Entertainer","Since the days of Chak De India, judging his grace & his stupendous acting skills, I am a huge fan of Shah Rukh Khan. A man of substance, he shows his skills in every film through his strong dialogue delivery & a firm grip over the emotional phenomena of the film. Every film he does, he makes it new for his audience & that is what makes him a stand-out actor. Just few hours back, I caught up with his new film released today 'Chennai Express' directed by the Singham & Golmaal director Rohit Shetty, co-starring Deepika Padukone. It showed the King of Romance in a dynamic never-seen-before avatar & some fun-rolled laughter & Rohit Shetty style action. Not much of surprise, the film touches all the genres of Bollywood completing a circle of entertainment. The film is the mixture of both: humour as well as some serious action. Frankly, I only liked Shetty for Golmaal & Singham. I found that mostly his films lacked sensibility & displayed some mindless insensitive action. But the fact that Shah Rukh Khan is starring in it made me really look into Chennai Express. Because as far as I know SRK, he is one of intelligent brains in Bollywood & knows completely well what he is up to. Not deviating from Chennai Express, I would like to tell about the plot. The story is about Rahul, a 40 year unmarried man, who lives with his grandparents in Mumbai. After his grandfather's death, Rahul embarks on a journey to Goa but a series of confusions & misunderstanding, he finds himself in Chennai Express, a train that brings a big turn in the life of Rahul leading him to the place where he is destined to be. Frustrated of his misfortune about not being able to go to Goa, Rahul meets Meenama, a South Indian girl from Kumban village in Chennai. She happens to be the pivotal part of the film that changes the monotony of Rahul's life. Rahul witnesses the ticket checker of the train being thrown in the waters from running train by the Tamil goons who happen to have kidnapped Meenama, thus being the only witness to the incident. Rahul is plunged into the world where he is being pestered, troubled & led into some humorous mishap. Shetty has depicted all of this in funny way that audience find themselves having the best time of their lives. Chennai Express is sheer entertainment with fun-filled comedy all over. There is action, romance & humour throughout the film. It will leave smiles on everyone's faces when they leave the theatre. It is very impressive and unlike all Rohit Shetty films, it has the powerful element of emotion, the element which Indian directors use to uplift their standard of cinema. The songs are combination of foot-tapping numbers as well as some melodiously extravagant songs. If you have caught up with all Rohit Shetty films, this one you will be the most satisfied with. The first time collaboration of Rohit Shetty- SRK duo will undoubtedly set the box office registers ringing." 
" fun family film","Chennai Express is really is a nice movie to enjoy with the family. A few parts are pretty funny. The only really main disappointing thing in my opinion was about the message conveyed about "real" men and violence at the very end. The violence was not too bad and most people would not shut their eyes like I did, but it was the message afterwards which bothered me especially as it had the conclusion of the story. So I didn't like the last ten minutes or so, but I'm happy to have watched the whole movie and overall it was entertaining for a nice Sunday afternoon. And of course I like the main actors SRK and Deepika (although the age gap is not so cool, but expected in the movies of these times because of the transitioning of the next generation main movie- stars)." 
" A good entertainer","I liked this movie as i enjoyed it.I watched it with my brothers,mother and it was very enjoyable.SRK did a good job by doing this role of Rahul.Depika was also good.This movie will entertain anyone throughout the movie.It has romance,comedy,some good action and good songs and music.It is a good combination of different things. But this movie is not as high rated as we want from SRK and ROHIT.We expect more from SRK. Another thing,this movie does not deserve to earn a lot as well as Krish 3 and Dhoom 3.-But i liked it because -It has good comedy. -The acting of SRK is always good. -The songs were good though i didn't like 1234 GET ON THE DANCE FLOOR. -I think the action of this movie was better than other recent commercial remake movies. -The natural scenery was beautiful.ABOVE AL IT IS A SHAHRUKH KHAN MOVIE.I LIKED HIM FORM MY CHILDHOOD." 
" Fantabulous & Completely Family Entertainer, A Winner","Awesome Movie.. Fantastic Songs And Background Music By Vishal-Sekhar.. As a Lyricist Amitabh Bhattacharya Has Done The Job Superbly... As Early Mentioned By SrK Previously Deepika's Name Is First On The Cast List That is a Unique Thought.. After a Bunch Of a Blockbuster Films Like Bol Bachchan & Golmaal 3 , Rohit Shetty Has Taken This Film Into Another Level.. Deepika Has Gained Her Fan Following Double After Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani.. Love The Way How Deepika Acts In The Entire Film... And The Villains (Satyaraj & Nikitin Dheer) Suits The Role Perfectly.. Its My First Movie Of Satyaraj & As a Villain He Takes My Heart.. And Finally Shahrukh Khan, He Has Done a Comedy Role After a Long Period.. What a Acting By Him Also.. At 47 He Looks Like 25 Years Old.. Being a Die-Hard Srk Fan If Anyone Wants a Mind Freshener, a Love Story , a Two & Half Hours Completely Action & Comedy Entertainer I Suggest You 2 Watch This Movie Once... At Last, But Not The Least, Srk+Deepika+RohitShetty+VishalSekhar+Satyaraj = (Biggest Bolckbuster)"
