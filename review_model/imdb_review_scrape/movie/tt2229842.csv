" The First Bollywood Movie Of 2013 Is Recommendable!","I seriously don;t know why critics gave this a bad rating. Is it because they loath actors like Khandelwal and Desae? Or is it because it is concept driven movie and not Dabangg 3?After 2012's debacle (I cannot list good movies except Kahaani, PSTomar & VDonor), I thought of giving Bollywood one more chance and here I am. Rajdhani Express was a blunder but Table No. 21 is a shocker. It is a great thriller and is sure to blow your head.The plot revolves around the couple and their journey which is more like a juxtaposition of "Sach Ka Saamna" & "Fear Factor". Paresh Rawal is excellent with his reverse Ghajini haircut and is a perfect narrator throughout the movie. Yes, there are many loopholes for the innovative and experimental flick, but I seriously nail-bit all along.If you chuck the amateur direction, screenplay, some cheesy bits and unwanted humor, Table No. 21 will serve as a great weekend blockbuster. I won;t spill the beans about a strong plot (which could've been executed well) because you have to watch it to get it.But, I am sure the box office will despise it because the actors are not celebrities but if have watched Khandelwal's Aamir & Desae's The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, you wouldn't be whining about the little mistakes this movie has to his credits. Instead, I suggest you block the previous year's bad masala-mirch vibe and watch this ingenious flick - the first watchable movie of 2013.WATCH OUT FOR: Paresh Rawal's portrayal of the mysterious and witty benefactor and most importantly the message that it states!Bottom Line: Watch this instead of Leander Paes' blunder off pitch.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: No | Sex: No | Foreplay, Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Nudity: Mild | Alcohol: Mild | Violence: Mild | Drugs: No" 
" no star-cast.....but excellent","Any normal Indian movie watcher would not opt for this movie because this is not a dabanng nor it is a rowdy rathore....but the matter of fact is this movie does make sense and has a adorable message in the end...To begin with, in the first hour you think this movie's concept to be an entertaining thriller one, for eg: luck. The concept is similar to sach ka saamna in which the couple on a vacation need to answer correctly all the questions in order to win a considerable amount of price money...Then begins a journey of thrill, betrayal and a game of life and death through hilarious series of tasks followed one after the other...As far as acting is concerned, Rajeev and Tena have done a descent job , but we miss the typical Paresh Rawal in the movie...The entire joyride i.e. the game named as table no.21 is just a bit lame and would have been made much better and more interesting...Just as you think that its a boring movie, comes the climax ....which according to me rubs off all the defects of the movie....The climax ( would not reveal the suspense) steals the show and ends up revealing and passing a strong message. At the end, we realize that the entire game-show has some meaning it...I know that this movie wouldn't do great on the box office.....for for me that doesn't matter and I recommend you to watch this movie in theaters......for me its 7/10...." 
" An Interesting Thriller!","Aditya Datt's 'Table No. 21' is An Interesting Thriller, that serves a dark yet absorbing story with a highly shocking & depressing culmination. Even the performances, are commendable! 'Table No. 21' Synopsis: A couple live a mediocre life and are thrilled to have won an exotic vacation to Fiji & their excitement increases when they get a chance to play a game for a mind boggling prize money.'Table No. 21' is thoroughly a thriller, although its dark & gets very heavy in its final act, which is highly shocking & depressing. It tackles a burning issue bleakly. Jimmy-Sen's Screenplay is well-penned & absorbing. Aditya Datt's Direction is top-notch. Cinematography captures the exotic locales of Fiji marvelously. Editing is stark. Music is hummable.Performance-Wise: The Always Amazing Paresh Rawal is faultless. He plays a twisted man with calculation & cruelty. Rajeev Khandelwal has emerged into a terrific actor. He emerges a big winner with his stupendous performance in here. Tena Desae looks stunning & delivers convincingly. Dhruv Ganesh is excellent.On the whole, 'Table No. 21' is a game well played!" 
" A Perfect Mirror Of Disturbing Reality In Our Countries Colleges","So, here is the review of first release of the 100th year of Indian cinema and its well crafted film that ends with a sensible twist. It is a suspense thriller with a unique concept of Tell All Truth game as well as complex dark past stories. There are 8 questions asked by mysterious Mr Khan(Paresh Rawal) for a reward of 21 Crores and each question is followed by a difficult task. Script is successful in making you think till the last scene but lacks direction as Aditya Datt is not able to handle performances of actors and not bale to make memorable. Rajeev Khandelwal is getting very choosy in selecting movies but its applauding. Paresh is full of style but not able to create fear as demanded by character. Tina is OK....a long way to for her. Last Words: Concept is interesting with a sensible social message. It is a mirror of disturbing reality in our countries college." 
" Topical and Good Approach","This one comes from the director of craps like Aashiq Banaaya Aapne, Dil Diya Hai(have you heard this movie name before??)But this time Aditya Dutt Delivers his career best with Table No.21.The movie gets into the run right from the start without wasting any time and gets even fast paced after Paresh Rawal's Entry.Best thing about the movie is its not too stretched and its a great watch. gripping to be true.Performance wise both Paresh Rawal and Rajeev deliver in their style as expected. Tena has overacted a bit in start 15 minutes though.Not to forget the actor who played Akram in the movie, his expressions just make you feel about the situation gone through.Direction is hats off with the links fitting very well.On the whole, Table No. 21 is for those who look forward for thrilling stuff.Not to be missed.9/10" 
" An excellent start to 2013!","2013 has begun well: "Table No. 21", the first Hindi film I've seen this year is an excellent start to what I hope will be an exceptional one for cinema. This film came to movie screens without any fanfare yesterday, with no hugely well-known names apart from that of character actor and noted scene-stealer Paresh Rawal. I was unfamiliar with Rajeev Khandelwal's work until now, but he's earning a name for himself doing unusual, offbeat films, and Tena Desae (weird spelling, but no matter â€“ I suppose her name is Tina Desai) debuted last year as Dev Patel's love interest in "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel". A young couple experiencing hard times wins a weeklong stay in picturesque Fiji. On their last night there, they're invited to dinner at a fancy resort. They are seated at Table No. 21, and welcomed with chilled Dom Perignon by the owner. He tells them that apart from the ultra-swanky resort, he runs a web-based game show that boasts eight million computer geek fans. The game sounds easy enough: answer eight questions with just "Yes" or "No", carry out eight tasks linked to the questions, and walk away with 10 million Fijian dollars, which equals Indian rupees 21 crores. Ah, yes, that No. 21 again! One simple rule not to be forgotten: If you lie, you die. Would they be interested in being that night's contestants? The broke couple cannot believe their good fortune. Within a couple of questions and tasks, it becomes clear that their mysterious host knows a lot about them. Each "Yes" or "No" answer becomes tougher as he forces them into truly sinister terrain. Suddenly the idyllic Fiji landscape takes on threatening hues. It would be unwise to ruin a taut, truly innovative thriller with more details. The title of the film gains significance when one considers Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the protection of life and personal liberty. No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty, except according to procedure established by law. It's impressive that such a small film has top-notch production values, a classy look, and best of all, thoughtful writing (Sheershak Anand, Abhijit Deshpande, Shantanu Ray Chibber, and Aditya Datt) and excellent performances. Veteran Paresh Rawal creates a multi-layered character one is unlikely to forget. You cannot take your eyes off him as his inscrutable, Machiavellian host turns the screws on the unfortunate game-show participants, while the hapless husband and wife do a fine job of winning our sympathy as their lives unravel before us. Director Aditya Datt, whose three prior films went unnoticed, deserves kudos for helming this one with a sure, steady hand. Ravi Walia's slick camera work makes the most of the scenic Fiji locations that become more and more foreboding with the film's darkening mood. Editor Devendra Murdeshwar contributes much to the pace and texture of the film, which will stay with you long after the end credits have rolled. This timely film has enormous crossover potential, but because few know it is playing, it might not get the audiences it deserves.Here's hoping 2013 will be filled with such imaginative, well-made fare." 
" Table No.21 is edgy , engrossing , well-directed with superb performances and lovely twist at the end","Table 21 was one of taut thriller with superb climax that will make you feel pity but also makes it an endearing watch.A couple 5th wedding anniversary vacation goes horribly wrong when they decide to play a game called Table No.21 with a restaurant owner who promises to pay them 21 crores if they manage to win the game. However, as they play the game, mystery unfolds and reveals the ultimate truth which will impact their lives.Aditya Datt(Ashiq Banaya Apne) completely surprises you his latest coming and especially if you are not expecting much from this movie. The story of playing a live-game has been witnessed before in movie LUCK but this was well-directed , well written and well-acted as well. The movie starts off with usual romantic stuff but gets to the point directly and keeps you engrossed till the actual drama unfolds. But main twist is in the end which is the highlight of the film and you will who is the main culprit here. Credit goes to the director for handling the thriller quite well. Acknowledgement for screenplay as well. Dialogues are good. Story is awesome. Songs are just about OK. Background score is nice. Cinematography is good. Performances by Rajeev Khandelwal and Paresh Rawal are brilliant. Both of them enact their part with conviction. Paresh Rawal surprises you with his versatile act.. in fact you are going to love his character. Rajeev Khandelwal is getting better with each film. You would appreciate his choice of films.Table No.21 is edgy , engrossing , well-directed with superb performances and lovely twist at the end. Excellent - 4/5" 
" Who deserves forgiveness ?","People commit not mistakes but blunders, not errors but sins, behave in not insensitive but sadistic ways. But ! How many of them ever realize their errors ? Very few. Very very few indeed. I have seen it and felt it as well in my own life through my own suffering in the hands of several people who might not have realized their misdoings till the moment of writing of this review. Then who deserves forgiveness whose glory is eternal and sung every now and then (for the victim only and not for the offender)?Table No. 21 deals with this issue but this fact is known only in the climax when the truth behind all the happenings during the movie is revealed. Frankly speaking, I feel that more or less the same idea worked behind movies like Zinda (2006) and Kidnap (2008). However, Table No. 21 is different from them whose script has been woven through a game-show which is telecast live on internet. The way in Agatha Christie's masterpiece novel - And Then There Were None and in the Hindi movie -Gumnaam (1965) which was its celluloid adaptation, the would-be victims are allured by the would-be murderer through a free-holiday abroad so that they reach the place which is going to be the death-hole for them, the same way the lead pair of Table No. 21 (Rajeev Khandelwaal and Teena Desaai) are trapped by the mastermind (Paresh Rawal) who calls them to Fiji by keeping them under an impression that they have won the trip. Considering themselves as lucky to enjoy the things they could only dream of prior to that, they land where the mastermind wanted them to land. And then they are further allured to play a game show titled as 'Table No. 21' through its whooping prize money of around 21 crores of rupees. The catch in the show is that they cannot leave the game in between and the tagline of the show is - 'If you lie, you die'. And then going through the rounds, one after another, the husband-wife duo suffer a lot out of their original greed. When the truth comes out in the end, they are taken aback and then realize what a shameful sin they had committed in their past.Table No. 21 is a spellbinding thriller. It's a bit slow in the first half but that's required for the build-up of the second breathtaking half. Flashbacks have been used to link the present happenings to the past of the main characters which I found as somewhat boring, still very useful for the understanding of the narrative. With a high production value (beauty of Fiji scattered like anything in different frames), the total presentation of the movie is simply superb. The movie appears to be treading the path of Slumdog Millionaire (2008) and the TV show - Sach Ka Saamna (hosted by none other than the hero of this movie) but once this small movie (105 minutes only) is over, you can contrast this with them and conclude that it's different.Technically the movie is up to the mark. The actions and thrills have been executed nicely though this movie is not action-oriented. The undercurrent of thrill, sensation, fear and above all sentiments makes it special. The ending scene containing repentance of the participants of the so-called game and expression of grief and anguish of their host moves the spectator deep within and makes him / her leave the theatre with a heavy heart. Whether the hero is actually the hero, whether the heroine is actually the heroine and whether the villain is actually the villain; will be known to you only when everything is over (for you and not for the characters of the story).Performances are good. Paresh Rawal takes the cake and the young actors shown in the flashback when the movie is undergoing its finale have also done superbly. Teena Desaai is a skilled actress (I simply loved her performance in Yeh Faasley which was released two years back) and she has done well here also. Rajeev Khandelwaal is also a good actor and barring some odd scenes, he has also done justice to his role. The bearded sidekick of Paresh Rawal who keeps on moving alongside the actions of his master throughout the movie, keeping a stony face and without uttering a single word from his mouth, has also impressed me very much.This thriller of a different genre is not everybody's cup of tea. If you are fond of taut thrillers sans comedy, romance etc., then only you will like it. The movie has touched the issue of ragging which is now a crime punishable by imprisonment in India but till a few years back, this vice was rampant in schools and colleges, swallowing several innocent young lives. And the filmmaker has made the audience realize the macabre after-effects of ragging very effectively.Before signing off, I come back to the original issue once again. Who deserves forgiveness ? So many posts, blogs, PP presentations, tales, articles and even books have been written singing the glory of forgiveness. It's a great virtue, no doubt. But it is good for the forgiving person who has been the sufferer in the first place. If the offender does not realize his / her error of hurting / harming the victim, what's the use of forgiveness ? I firmly believe, forgiveness is deserved by those only who realize their error / sin and repent for that, going for penitence. If one does not realize his / her error / sin and does not repent, then the victim may opt for forgiveness, the Lord should not. Poetic justice should prevail and punishment should be meted out to such insensitive sinners." 
" good watch if first half is forgiven","Anything that seem to be too much for it own good doesn't always have good motives behind it. Like when your neighbour is being extra nice towards you when he needs some favour to be done or when you professor has the that tacky smile on his face when handing out booklets. Something inside tells you that you don't deserve this and the equation of karma doesn't fit in. But nobody takes a cue and thus refuting their guts they continue to go deeper until they realise the cost.When the Vivaan And Siya, married for 5 years decide to spend their 5th anniversary in the islands of Figi on a lucky draw prize they won, they are in for a surprise. On the last day of their stay, the jobless Vivaan and his affable wife are lured into a game called Table No. 21 hosted by Abdul Razzaq Khan in a bid to win $10million FJ which is approximately Rs 21 crores. But it is not all rosy as it looks, to get to the prize money the couples has to answer correct 8 questions put by the host and correspondingly do the given tasks after each. This all goes well with the moto or the catch line of the game(also the movie) 'If you lie, you die'.Touted as thriller, this movie starts rather slow, not rushing into the mystery of the plot. The first few minutes into the game for me were silly with protagonists laughing at the plausibility of earning 21 crores which may be rational in real life but seems very boring and uninteresting on screen. Also as the movie gives us rare thrilling aspects it hardly leaves us spellbound. To be more precise the movie fails in the main area i.e. the part where the audience should be enthralled. Most of the questions and tasks in the movie were bland and could have been more innovative to hold up the attention.But to it's credit the movie does starts to kick in with all cylinders just after the start of second half. This is the part when the protagonist start getting more aware and the antagonist more villainy. Although most of the movie is shot in plush 5 star hotels, getting the feel of the place might have helped the movie. It's very difficult to avert ones eyes from the screen at this part of the movie filled with new mysteries and awaiting twists. The music is also a plus point for the movie with some good tunes to hum about. By the time climax arrives the story is splayed with open can of worms and new revelations about the past as a result of the game being played and thus the reason of the initialisation of such a deathplay comes to fore. Some lines in this movie are really good and need very loud applause for the dialogue writer.Rajeev Khandelwal as Vivaan plays his part like he does in every other movie, with honesty and putting 100% to his portrayal. Although the start is slightly scratchy but he rarely falters as he makes his character hapless infront of audience. Tena Desae does more than giving us that wide drooling smile or the alluring bikini walk. She has great dialogue delivery and her acting is quite good (after her recent stint in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel). Paresh Rawal shifts the movie into another higher gear in the second half. He kind of holds it in the first half but his second half is really symbolic of his acting prowess. That menacing smile and those witty dialogues gives his villainous personality a new high. He need to do more of this kind villain projects.When Siya says Money can buy everything in this world, Mr. Khan respond immediately saying not the past, ponder over this because around this very line the whole movie revolves. It's laudable attempt by Aditya Dutt one that just manages to push the envelop and stand out in the most template driven movies. Must watch." 
" Highly Recommended !! If you are an extremely choosy moviegoer who watches select first-rate films a year.","It's not just the premise that grabs your attention, but TABLE NO. 21 stands out because it doesn't borrow the formulaic template, nor does it rely on the predictable twists and turns or caricaturist characters to enthrall the spectator. It's clever, engaging and carries a message that hits you like a ton of bricks. Importantly, it's a well crafted thriller that delivers more than what it promised in its attention-grabbing promos. TABLE NO. 21 is a commendable movie-going experience. If you are an extremely choosy moviegoer who watches select first-rate films a year, make sure TABLE NO. 21 is included on your listing. Strongly recommended!Highly Recommended" 
" We all like surprises in this tedious lifestyle. TN21 just does that!","The trend in Bollywood for the first six months of any year has been more of small budget, small actors but large concept film. The remaining half half is followed with big films every Friday with big stars and unfortunately small concept. This year might not be any different. Bollywood has never had a superhit film on the first Friday of an year. 2013's first film Table No.21(TN21) comes as a surprise. Its not a superhit but worth a watch.Rajeev Khandelval and Tena Desae play a modern married couple who understand today's world and know all what they want from it and all what they can do for it - money. TN21 starts with a great song which actually works wonders to set the premise in five minutes instead of twenty minutes of boredom employed by other films. In a non-starer film it is very difficult to captivate the audience from the inception. The first song, the background score and Tena Desae do that job here. Once this happens the show is hijacked by the exceptional Paresh Rawal. Paresh takes it till the end with his little game of rounds with a humongous prize money which our couple here craves. The screenplay is excellent but could have been tighter. The unmatched comedy of Paresh Rawal helps a lot for the film. The climax is a surprise but extremely convincing.TN21 is comes from an unheard director Aditya Datt who actually becomes 4-films old after this. Fortunately his earlier films have been only neglected and not bombarded. Nobody cared. But this film shall give him a surviving space.Talking of performances, Paresh Rawal is the king. This man is in his own league. Rajeev Khandelwal has been very choosy in his films. He does the same and gives a brilliant performance. What you miss in him is just a tincy bit of attitude. Tena Desae does fine in her part, in fact excellent if compared to the number of good actresses in India now. This can get her career rolling.The music is rapt. There are only two songs. The second is not even complete. The score does a very fine job. the cinematography is different but not exceptional.On the whole, TN21 is a one time must watch due to its culmination. We all like surprises in this tedious lifestyle. TN21 just does that!"

" A powerful script which combines the +ves of 'Zinda' and 'Saw series' in the right amounts.","Amidst the period of non sensical cinema, any movie with a 'story' is welcome. Here's one such from Aditya and hope the audience appreciate such cinema more. Rajeev Khandelwal as the lead actor and a newbie as the actress; how many of you would really go for such cinema! Take the risk and you will be surprised with what's in store for you.The movie begins with the lead actors entering a game show that makes them answer 8 questions, perform 8 tasks and win a hefty 21 crore as a part of their anniversary package deal. Tempting, ah ! . Money never comes free and along with answering 8 questions they have to perform 8 tasks to win the same. Every task has a meaning and is justified. The USP of the film is its climax, its hard hitting and in the right sense. After having so many positives , what went wrong here was the casting; Rajeev is strictly OK, he lacks the 'Aaamir' touch. The newbie Tena is a dummy and Paresh Rawal doesn't quite hit the chord as we expect him to. Had this department been filled by stalwarts, this movie was none less than a masterpiece.Hopefully , the director was able to deliver his message to the audience and we wish similar justice for all such wrong - doers. This one's worth a watch !" 
" Oldboy remake again?","Circa 2006, Zinda released which was an unofficial remake of A Korean film Oldboy(2003). The film was panned badly and rejected by the audiences. In 2013, Table No.21 releases with Rajeev Khandelwal, Paresh and Tena Desae. The film caught ones attention ever since the promo was out with Paresh in a sinister look and with his dialogue- If You Lie you Die. The film has a good story and though it borrows heavily from Hollywood yet it keeps you engrossed. It may not be a perfect thriller yet it does have it's moments, the twists and turns, especially the finale which gives out a social message is brilliant but the problem is that the film drags in between and the film gets predictable especially if you have seen Zinda let alone Oldboy.Direction by Aditya Datt who gave crass films earlier like Aashiq Banaya Aapne and Dil Diya Hai redeems himself, he handles several scenes well Music is okayRajeev Khandelwal portrays his weakness and all emotions perfectly, yet again proving his talent. Tena Desae is good in her part Paresh Rawal fresh after the critical acclaim of Oh My God does a superb job, bringing out various characteristics of the role perfectly, he is simply outstanding in the finale. rest are adequate" 
" Crime that should be rooted out!","It starts as a game where a couple can win a considerable amount of money. In general when that happens in a movie plot, the movie is not appreciated generally by critics. Here it stands different, the later part of the movie defines why the movie turns out the way it is. At the end, certain facts are shown. I am sure the numbers are considerably low as compared to real statistics. I follow the end credits as article no. 21 - 'protection of life and personal liberty'.The movie comes out as a brave attempt highlighting for a cause, not losing its entertainment value. As the movie progresses we find it more engaging.Final verdict: The evil of ragging needs to be rooted out, whatever it takes, implementing discipline since early phase of life or strict laws and punishment for the culprit." 
" A must watch film for everyone--especially for those who rag","THIS MOVIE IS NOT JUST A THRILLER;IT IS A WONDERFUL APPROACH AT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF RAGGING.PARESH RAWAL IS JUST SUPERB AS MR.KHAN,A FATHER WHO SEEKS REVENGE FROM THE TORMENTORS OF HIS SON AKRAM.AT FIRST IT SEEMS TO BE A THRILLER WHEN A COUPLE IS ASKED TO PLAY A GAME CALLED TABLE NO 21 SIMILAR TO TRUTH OR DARE.SOON THE QUESTIONS ASKED IN THE GAME AND TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM BECOME EXTREME.THE VIEWER MAY FIND IT DISTURBING.HOWEVER,WHEN THE REALITY IS SHOWN AT THE END,ALL FEELINGS WILL CHANGE TOWARDS THE CHARACTERS.THE WAY MR KHAN TAKES REVENGE FROM THE COUPLE FOR RAGGING HIS SON IS PERFECT.EVERY SINNER WHO DOESN'T FEEL SORRY NEEDS TO BE PUNISHED SEVERELY.THIS IS THE MAIN THEME OF THE MOVIE,WHICH IS INDEED A GREAT AND UNIQUE THOUGHT.IT MUST BE MADE CLEAR TO SUCH MONSTERS THAT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IS INHUMAN AND THAT NO ONE WOULD TOLERATE THEM.A MUST WATCH FILM."
