" Who watches movies like this?","Oh, my gosh.  This has to be like the most retarded movie I have ever seen, or wait, attempted to see.  I called it quits very soon.  I wonder what this DVD was ever doing in my house.  How could I subject myself to watching such an idiotic film?  I can't think of a single good thing to say about this movie.  First of all, I waited for a long time, and I just didn't see a story starting at all.  All that was going on was a bunch of people socializing and taking care of their animals.  I love animals, but I don't want to sit for half-an-hour watching a horse nod its head.  I felt like I was watching a movie from the 1940s or something.  It's ridiculous, so I went back to the DVD menu and browsed through the chapter selection, taking a look at the titles of all the chapters.  After looking them over, I was so glad I stopped watching the movie.  In all 20 or so chapters, I found maybe two that contribute to the "story."  Songs are ear-screeching."
