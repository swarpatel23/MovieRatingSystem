" one of the best bolly rom-coms in last two decades (better than the over hyped blockbusters)","A boy loses job- the boy is frustrated- the boy meets a girl full of life – the boy falls in love – then . Before drawing into any conclusion about "so cliché" I would have revealed the marvelous ending of "Ek Main aur Ek tu" but that would have been a crime. Ek Main Aur Ek Tu is typical yet a fresh take on urban relationship. Rarely a bollywood romantic movie arrives which is devoid of melodrama and loud inane dialogs. The trend had been started with Imtiaz Ali which is lapped by these new directors. Shakun Batra's "EK main aur ek tu" is one such breath of fresh air coming surprisingly from Dharma Productions which believes in "over-the-top" sequences. Like any love story EMAET is a story of a boy and a girl who are totally opposite in their upbringing and characters. Rahul is a shy introvert architect who is in search of his true self thanks to his over-dominating parents – his mother, a socialite who wants everything to be prim proper and his father, a businessman who wants him to reach the top. On the other hand Riana Braganza is a bubbly girl full of life who takes life as it is without any planning. Such contrasting characters had only one element in common – Loss (one at emotional level and another at professional level). With their breezy encounter in a psychiatrist's chamber they began their journey which land into a false marriage under drunken state and there-in. There is nothing much in the story but it's real execution which will appeal to those who are fed up with larger than life films. Shakun Batra and Ayesha DeVitre's story might not be fresh but full credit goes to the writers to come up with real scenario and such an unconventional ending. The ending is probably the most practical and matured one which I am witnessing first time in any Hindi romantic film in last two decades. Shakun Batra's shows eye for detailing and we hope to see more decent stories coming from him. The humor of the film gels with the mood. Subtle, matured and trendy it never hams. He has the potential to be the next Imtiaz Ali. David Macdonald does a good job in camera while Asif Shaikh does a better job in editing department. The film has been trimmed down to 2 hours thus the proceedings never lost it's momentum. One of the best part of the film is Amit Trivedi – Amitabh Bhattacharya (music – lyrics) combo which has always worked. From Dev D to Udaan to No one killed Jessica this combo has successfully delivered some "hatke" soundtrack which grows on you. The situation and lyrics of "Gubbare" is probably one of the best picturised romantic songs in last few years. And a special mention to "Aunty" for it's outlandish lyrics. Bosco- Casear's choreography is appropriate and creative. Coming to the acting part Imran Khan and Kareena Kapoor complimented each other. Imran Khan was restrained as Rahul, an architect who loses his job but feels afraid to tell his parents. His gradual transformation was done in a non-filmy passion which should appeal to those who loves mature drama. Kareena rocks as Riana who is someway similar to Jab We Met's Geet but more matured than her. The contrast between the two families is will depicted and seriously Ratna Pathak Shah and Boman Irani excel in the role of Rahul's parents. One wishes to see Ratna Pathak Shah more on screen with her flawless comic timing. The actors who played the various roles of Riana's family member are competent enough to leave their mark specially one who played Riana's father and the old lady who played the cute granny. Ram Kapoor makes his presence felt in an important cameo. Overall "Ek main aur ek Tu" is a perfectly average film which makes it unique in the current scenario where all films are trying to go over the top (literally). With it's simple yet practical ending the film strikes a chord and I hope there will be many more who will love the different ending , something rarely seen in Bollywood rom-coms." 
" A charming antidote to standard Valentines' Day fare...","When "Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu" rolled out just in time for Valentines' Day, it appeared to be another romantic trifle designed for parting swooning fools from their disposable income. I'm glad the timing of its release and cutesy poster didn't put me off, for it's actually a beast of different stripe.For a start, Imran Khan – heart-throb du jour of young girls—is not cast in heroic vein. He plays Rahul Kapoor, only offspring of an over-achieving architect father and a socialite mother. An amusing opening montage shows various types of kids: goody-two shoes, hell-raisers in angel guise, rebels looking for a cause, and so on. And then we have Rahul. From infancy, he's been told exactly what to do and how to do it. His own aptitudes don't matter for his father wants a miniature high-achieving clone of himself, while Mom is preoccupied with the pursuit of eternal youth. When the tot announces he's won a silver medal for swimming, his father witheringly corrects him, "No, what you did was lose the gold." Unsurprisingly, Rahul grows up into a permanently browbeaten youth with a pathological compulsion for neatness and a passion for ironing his socks. Precisely the kind to sweep girls off their feetDispatched to Las Vegas by Dad to intern at a big American firm as a preliminary step to becoming India's next architectural wunderkind, Rahul gets fired and doesn't know how to break it to his parents. That very day, they fly in to spend Christmas with him. Can a young man's life get more excruciatingly wretched? Why, yes, because his folks haul him off to the Christmas party from hell. A horrified Rahul gets unsolicited sex advice from Dad's loudmouthed friend, while the friend's new wife (hello, Mrs. Robinson) gropes his bum. Rahul makes a run for it, knocking over a waiter with an enormous platter, causing everybody to stare. Rahul's parents look pained. More withering looks follow and they depart for India in a gust of disappointment.When Rahul encounters Riana Braganza, a free-spirited hairstylist, similarly unemployed, he feels compelled to prove he is no snore-inducer. Bolstered by copious quantities of alcohol, he loosens up and actually has fun. In a boozy blur, they impulsively get married at a chapel officiated by an Elvis impersonator.This is no unacknowledged rip-off of "What Happens in Vegas"—it turns into something else entirely: a sweet-natured, generous-hearted reflection on human follies. Told they have to wait until the New Year for an annulment, Rahul and Riana return to India for a week. The Las Vegas location seemed arbitrary because the lead pair must get hitched in a hurry for the story to move forward – it's when the action shifts to India that the film hits its stride. In Bombay, Rahul witnesses another type of family: boisterous fun, affectionate, supportive with no secrets or lies. The Braganzas take him into their bosom, and he blossoms into a fairly agreeable young man with sporadic bursts of confidence. Does this mean boy and girl will now fall in love and decide to remain married? It would be wrong to reveal any more, but suffice to say this is a charming antidote to the cloying sugariness of usual Valentines' Day fare.Kareena Kapoor's Riana Braganza has certain shades of Geet, the character she played to perfection in "Jab We Met", but they are sufficiently unalike to hold one's interest. With scarlet streaks in her locks, a well-moisturized complexion, and a junior miss wardrobe, 32-year old Kareena does a pretty persuasive job of projecting youthful spontaneity and her pairing with the boyish Imran Khan doesn't jar. But, honey, it might be more fun to play women as opposed to girls – look at the blast Vidya Balan's having these days. Imran Khan does a sterling job of playing squished—it's genuinely delightful watching him perk up as the film progresses. Ratna Pathak Shah and he reprise their mother-son roles (Ratna was Imran's mom in "Jaane Tuya Jaane Naa"), but the relationship they share couldn't be more dissimilar. Here Ratna doesn't have a single nurturing bone in her sleek well-toned bod. She's very funny as the self-absorbed, vain socialite, deliciously glamorous in a number of fashion forward looks. She made me laugh aloud when Imran finally has a cathartic meltdown at a dinner party, venting his rage at constantly being infantilized, a perplexed Ratna asks, "But what's wrong with chopsticks?" How I would love to see Ratna play Amanda Prynne in "Private Lives" opposite—who else?—Naseeruddin Shah as Elyot Chase in a Hindi version of that evergreen Noel Coward drawing-room comedy. Boman Irani is wonderfully off-putting as the severe, perpetually disapproving father whose first instinct is to scowl. In a small cameo, Soniya Mehra (the late Vinod Mehra's daughter?) is a hoot as the extremely amorous date who decides to have her way with the cowering Imran.Riana's large and loving family – all new to me, did fine work, especially her plump fun-loving dad completely devoid of tact. I also loved her toothless granny, tottering at the edge of dementia.If one had to quibble, I would point to the cultural stereotypes the film plays on: Riana's laid-back tolerant family drinks, smokes, doesn't get bent out of shape over premarital sex –they're Christians, you see—maligned in India for their loose morals and tight clothing. But here they're the good guys, so that would just be me being tetchy - pay no heed.Karan Johar has shrewdly mentored a number of fledgling filmmakers, and Shakun Batra,who co-wrote (with Ayesha DeVitre, hairstylist/writer—a truly uncommon hyphenate) and directs this film, proves yet again that Johar has impeccable instincts for choosing producing projects. Shakun's film has an authentic voice and tone and his characters are endearingly flawed, funny, and very human." 
" A refresher!!","Post Jab We Met, we've had a bunch of chirpy love stories release. Most of them had the same old concept of rich kids (either one) falling in love, then breaking up, and finally ending up together (Anjaana Anjaani, Break Ke Baad, etc). From the trailer, this pretty much looked like one of those films. There were even rumors of it being a Hollywood rip-off. But, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is nothing like those idiotic flicks, nor is it a rip-off. It's a very cute little movie with some excellent, if not brilliant performances.Directed by débutant Shakun Batra, EMAET has its heart in the right place. It is not one of those typical love stories (I would in fact not categorize it as a love story). It's more of a lighthearted comedy with friendship as its backdrop. Imran Khan is getting better as an actor, Kareena, well, is just gorgeous, and their chemistry is great. Perfect casting, decent music, excellent cinematography, slick screenplay, what more do you need to make a good feature film??Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu might be predictive, but is a very well executed movie with a refreshing feel to it. Some might not like it, but I did, and suggest you go watch it.For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)" 
" Absolutely refreshing!","Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a film by Dharma Productions, starring none other than the glamorous Kareena Kapoor and the rising Imran Khan. Kareena reprises as a bubbly optimistic character. (which we last saw in Jab We Met as Geet)She plays Rianna Briganza, a hairstylist in Las Vegas. Imran Khan plays Rahul Kapoor, whose whole life has been planned out for him by his parents. During one drunken night in Vegas where one thing leads to another, the two end up getting married. The film itself is very refreshing. It is not your typical Karan Johar film. The story plays itself out over two weeks and how Rahul's(Imran's) life changes forever. By the end of the film, you feel like you've watched a good film. It doesn't keep you off the edge of your seats, it doesn't make you reach for your handkerchiefs, it simply makes your day a joyful one. A must-watch for all you guys who want to see something new." 
" A Decent Effort!","Debutant Director Shakun Batra's 'Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu' is A Decent Effort, that has its moments. It has some merits, that work on its advantage. However, the Slow-Pace as well as the Abstract Culmination play a spoil-sport.'Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu' Synopsis: A few drinks too many leads an uptight architect and quick- witted hairstylist to marry in Las Vegas. Can a mistake lead to friendship and love?'Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu' borrows its basic premise from the Hollywood Hit 'What Happens In Vegas', but otherwise the film is original, as much as I can recall. The film begins tepidly, but gathers momentum when the protagonists get hitched accidentally. Ayesha Devitre & Shakun Batra's Screenplay has its moments. However, as mentioned, the Slow-Pace & the Abstract & Unconvincing Culmination play a spoil-sport. The pacing definitely could've been faster & the culmination needed to be Convincing. Shakun Batra's Direction, shows immense promise. The Debutant has the spark one expects from a filmmaker. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is fair. Music by Amit Trivedi, is passable.Performance-Wise: Kareena Kapoor is dependable, as always. Imran Khan has improved as an actor & he does impress in some scenes, especially in the scene where he confronts his parents. Boman Irani is superb. Ratna Pathak Shah is as usual. Ram Kapoor & Sonia Mehra are winsome in cameos. The actors who play Kareena's Parents, are extremely charming. On the whole, 'Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu' is flawed, but a decent watch nonetheless." 
" Something different for a typical Indian movie !!!","Ek Main aur Ek Tu was out of box thinking rom-com movie enhanced with matured acting by Imran Khan and Kareena Kapoor along with soothing music by Amit Trivedi that gels well with the mood of the film. Rahul Kapoor (Imran Khan) is an average guy dominated by his nagging filthy rich parents telling him how to wear cloths , how to eat food . Rihana Brigenza (Kareena Kapoor) is a happy-go-lucky gal who enjoys her freedom and lives her to the fullest. However , their fate changes when their paths cross each other and soon they realize they want much more in life than just their daily routine. Directed by the first time director ,Shakun Batra, EMAET is a film which dares to cross the line and the result is fruitful. Hats off to the director for choosing such a different subject which challenges the patience of the audience and yet follows the simplicity of Indian Cinema. The film may start of with a typical boy-meet-girl romance but ends on something which I could never ever thought of.Screenplay is commendable keeping audience's interest alive. Imran Khan is getting better with each film. He has given his best performance till now and is on the verge of becoming a method actor. Kareena Kapoor is always a reliable when it comes to acting and though she shows shades of Jab We Met , she does a great job. Cinematography is outstanding capturing the beautiful location of Las Vegas and Mumbai. Production design is simple yet charming. Music by Amit Trivedi is soulful with the title song being the best among others. Rest of the star cast do justice to their part. So , overall , a perfect rom-com flick coupled with strong presence of Imran Khan and Kareena Kapoor. Good – 3.5/5" 
" cute little movie","unlike many of my friends I like the movie maybe because I could identify with it in some parts but frankly there are very few movies in Indian cinema on friendship between adult male and female.. there was this film bemisal where amitabh and rakhi's character had amazing chemistry but in all other movies friendship is ultimately morphed into love but not here another good thing was Vegas was not shown from a tourist perspective but from perspective of someone who lives there so unlike many other Indian movies which will show Vegas as strip club, casino and bars only ( well that is pretty much), here it is just a backdrop film was nicely paced with audience not feeling bored at any point of time but character of his parents were unbelievable..maybe some boss might treat their juniors that way but not father son there was its share of stereotyping when they show parents of kareena or imran but kareena had some good lines. Imran was wooden as usual and he never looked devastated on losing job or how shallow that kind of upbringing can make you was not apparenta better male lead and I would have given it a 10 ad yes songs were good but not DevD standard though the team is same here" 
" Totally worthless movie","I heard a lot about this movie but not good, Also saw the trailer which was good, but after my friend ask me to go see it I did, and I regret it, I don't know how people could like movies who's plot are copied from other movie. If they could have made it a better movie I might be praising them but here is not the case. Even after copying it they put cheesy shot which had no relevance to the story. This movie is neither fun nor educational and definitely not Artistic in any way Acting on both Imran Khan and kareena was good, but the story was NOT. Although they tried to copy the script from " What happen in Vegas " which by the was was " Awesome " Movie which me and my friend enjoyed a lot.There is a shot where Imran ask his previous girlfriend for a date " who had dumped him because he was boring ". But now she is all over him cause he just she said to her that she is beautiful, and even take him to the bathroom for " you know what " They tried to show it as a comedy scene, totally not funny.If you are planning to see this move in Movie hall, that would be a waste of money and time, watch it when it will come on cable or something." 
" A good rom-com from bollywood after a long time","Before going for this movie, i had minimal expectations for this movie as there were comparisons drawn between this one and wht hppnd in vegas....but to clear the air, its no where similar to it in fact this one is better than that. Don't know why but i was reminded of 500 days of summer while watching this.Now coming to movie, it starts slowly. First 15 minutes are just decent, nothing great. But after this movie takes pace, when both leads start a journey of their lifetime. Plot is quite predictable but the treatment is quite unique from the first time director. There are so many light, comic moments thereafter that will keep u engaged and smiling at same time.Regarding performances, kareena is in full form after playing feedle to khan's in ra one and bodyguard. She had owned this role completely. She was fantastic. Imran Khan was surprisingly good. Normally i don't like him except in Janne tu and Delhi belly. This was his best performance till date. All other supporting cast was good too.Special mention for the ending which differentiates it from all other standard rom-coms. Ending is much realistic and was cheery on the cake.Simply loved this movie and will recommend to go for this if u r a fan of rom-coms like Notting Hill, 500 days of summer etc. Recommended." 
" stupidest climax i have ever seen","What a trashy film. Bad acting and irritating Kareena. Boring and the same acting of Imran in other films of his 'Break Ke Baad, I hate Luv Storys, Mere Brother Ki Dulhan' etc. He seems to be act mostly in romantic comedies. Shortest Hindi film i have ever come across. It's only 96mins. I pitied Imran's character in this film and poor guy he had a rough childhood with his parents and a worse friend Kareena who led him on and in the end she says 'i only look at you as a friend'. Utter rubbish. I think people who think that way are losers. Hehe. Anyway if you are a fan of both of them then watch it otherwise stay clear. Its just another lousy ripoff of Jab We Met." 
" A Nutshell Review: Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu","You know Valentine's Day is just around the corner when a slate of romantic films get positioned by distributors to capture that whiff of love in the air. Postponed from an October release last year, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is this year's major Bollywood offering for the romantic season and has two successful stars of recent years, Imran Khan and Kareena Kapoor, pairing up for the first time in what would seem like a typical comedy of opposites attracting, but this Karan Johar produced film had other plans to stand out, and it did, quite surprisingly, by being spiritual cousin of Marc Webb's (500) Days of Summer.Why? Because it's a story about friendship more than that of romantic partners, not that they don't try, or at least one character did. But it stuck to its Bollywood roots quite firmly in being an all round entertainer rather than to embroil itself around strong, tearful emotions that (500) Days brought about. And it's interesting to see how signals can be (mis)interpreted, with the story by Shakun Batra and Ayesha DeVitre, the former who also directed the film, dealing all the cards through examples that very often those in love, or out of, would face from time to time.Some detractors would have judged this film prematurely from its trailer and thought that it was yet another unauthorized Bollywood remake of It Happened in Vegas, since this film contains characters who are vastly opposites hanging out in Sin City, and through a drunken stupor gotten married in one of the many quickie marriage chapels the city has to offer, before waking up the next day not only with a massive hangover, but realizing that they are married. There might be a hint of similarities in that setting, but the story was anything but similar from that point on.Taking place over the Christmas to New Year period where year end celebrations of sorts are abound, where ties amongst family and friends get reaffirmed and renewed, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu shines precisely because of the leading actors' chemistry, range and their vivid fleshing of well written characters. All other aspects of the film really didn't matter as you'll be transfixed by their interaction, although I would like to say that the song Aunty Ji was memorable and remarkable. Imran and Kareena sparkle each time they share loads of screen time together, making you wish you were somehow involved in the plenty of fun they get to find themselves in.Imran Khan has had a series of successful films where he plays the alpha romantic lead, but here he transforms into the meek and geeky Rahul Kapoor, a man, or boy rather, who has been brought up shackled to do what his parents (played by Boman Irani and Ratna Pathak Shah) so desire, with Dad always thinking his son never measures up, and his mom being a frivolous woman interested with only the family's social standing. If one does not dare talk to Dad, and in general doesn't connect with one's parents, frankly I weep for that person, being programmed to approach life in a certain way rather than to take in whatever unexpectedness that life can dish out. Imran makes his Rahul believable and likable, with that dorkiness no thanks to being belittled and shackled throughout life, sapping and stifling all spirit within him. Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is the story of his breaking free.And Kareena Kapoor becomes his emotional crutch to do just that. You may wonder if she's acting cute, but I have to admit that her approach doesn't make it look too artificial, or forced so badly that you'd begin to dislike her role. Granted Kareena isn't the youngest of the stars in Bollywood of late, but she sure showed who amongst the industry possess incredible acting chops, and she shines as the ditzy, and expense conscious Riana who's emotionally not so stable, and Captain Vice to Rahul's many unplanned shenanigans. It helps of course that when the movie has to shift locales back to India that her zany, quirky family members were that breath of fresh air needed to counterbalance and contrast that with the rich, stiff upper lip folks of Rahul's.It's that overarching theme of finding contentment and happiness in one's life, short that it already is, that makes this film a winner. It is simple in its execution without many fanciful bells and whistles, entirely focused on the story that we should be living life the way we want to, rather than to spend it living the way others would want us to. And perhaps as a date movie for the Valentine's Weekend, a reminder that it's also a celebration of friendships as well, not only reserved to those with whom we share a romantic relationship with. And perhaps it will hurt less as well, for those amongst us who are have uneventful or unsuccessful love lives, that it's not really the end of the world, really. Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is highly recommended fare!" 
" Simply Sweet Salty Romance","EK MAIN AUR EK TU (Movie Review) ONE LINER:Simply Sweet Salty Romance.EXPECTATIONS: New fresh pairing of IMRAN KHAN and KAREENA KAPOOR getting together for a rom-com at the edge of valentine's day, being produced by KARAN JOHAR. So definitely expectations were quite positive and in plusses..STORY & SCRIPT:The best thing of the story was that it was simple and straight wwhich made the film quite a good film. Script was very nice but could have been more tighter.DIRECTION:SHAKUN BATRA being a debut director have done a very decent job. He have made the film simple and gave a very new touch to the film which has not been seen in the BOLLYWOOD. Kind of a style of Hollywood rom-coms. Directed first half much better than the second half but the climax is directed very intelligently.. A nice addition to the new directors lot. He has not tried to complex anything or any extra emotions or any sort of tadka, ehich makes his style a bit unique than others.MUSIC:Expectations were more from EMET as music composer was also AMIT TRIVEDI. Actually it's very much a good album but still it could have been a much better album than this. The title track EK MAIN AUR EK TU is the best of the lot. Followed by AHATEIN.The picturizatio of songs is just brilliant as it also made just average songs worthful and u wana enjoy them especially video made AUNTY JI enjoyable which was a poor track.CASTING & ACTING:IMRAN KHAN was the best choice for hero's character here and he has performed it brilliantly. He has acted just too good. His expressions and timing was the best in his career. His one of the best performance. Specially in first half he overtakes even Kareena.KAREENA KAPOOR in avatar of western GEET from jab we met. She has played the role with ease. and she has acted very well and u always enjoy her character, Her presence is so fresh.Remaining in supporting roles the best is the actor played role of Kareena's father. he makes u laugh with his lines and acting.. BOMAN IRANI , RATNA PHATAK and RAM KAPOOR all were OK.PLUSSES & MINUSES: PLUSSES: 1. It's simplicity and straight forward attempt.2. Watch it for IMRAN KHAN. he has acted too well.3.

" Waste n copied","Copy of Hollywood movie What happen in Vegas. Not at all a new concept, Music is Trashy so are actors....Awful awful movie even after copied. A suggestion for audience that please please don't fall for such kind crap...I mean seriously we are billion out there and if 20% of us watch once this crappy movie...it gonna make the looser director n actors millionaires....Read the review first before watch..... Even the original movie was not successful..it was sort of Average movie...but this is the disaster of that movie. All the readers please don't watch n spend ur money n time in some useful movie or thing. Director's come on u can do it....we are full of cultures n concept...don't follow crappy ideas and concept...be smart to copy" 
" Utterly, Jaw droppingly, amazing.","Wow. That was the only word my lips had managed to slip out after the movie. I stepped into the theater expecting a What happened in Vegas type movie, and came out thinking why the hell I thought that. Imran Khan's acting is not only on the up hill, but I believe this is his finest movie yet since Jaane tu. Normally playing the 'lover boy' in most movies, he took a different aspect on things this time and took a risk. In what seemed like a leap of death, he executed the role amazingly. Kareena Kapoor's acting was absolutely flawless, nailing all the perfect expressions when needed. Although many would not have liked her character, she played her role absolutely perfectly. The role suited Kareena, and was a tad similar to what she had in 3i. The movie wouldn't have been what it was with the wonderful debutante director Shakun Batra, which whom I was surprised to see had also acted with Imran in Jaane tu. Also, with being it a Dharma productions, it held its own place in the bollywood film industry.Overall, an utterly amazing movie...maybe not so much for the younger, but I recommend it for anyone over 13. You'll come out of the cinema glad that you payed to see it." 
" Could have been a lot better","The film has a very promising start which raises your expectations and takes you to the level where you begin to enjoy the sequences. It takes you rapidly from a budding boy who is so called "well-behaved", "disciplined" and "trophy" son who is raised as a robot and his parents expect him to be nothing but always a "numero uno". He himself never realizes his own identity and grows up to be an architect, oh well, but he is just an "average" guy who is not a great fit for that profession so he gets sacked. Now enters a totally opposite, "happy-go-lucky" gal who he despises at first but accidentally gets married to her (after over 100 drinks..literally, as shown) as you can get married anytime 24/7 in Las Vegas..right? Oh well, the rest of the movie is about his struggle with himself as he undergoes through identity-crisis and this gal helps him get over the goody-goody mama-papa's boy to a man who can live life on his own terms..while he also starts thinking that he loves her, but wait, she thinks they are just friends..so, now, that's how they end up...As I said earlier, it begins with lot of interest setting the bar high but then you just see the monotonous pace and predictable sequences which makes you feel..oh, cmon. The meeting is quite abrupt, the superstore phone conversation sounds to unrealistic (for US at least), then thinking that Rahul is following her is another unrealistic event, keeping the file of another patient and hitting him in a public place is invitation to the security. Drinking in public is not allowed in LV as well, moreover, police having fun with you while you are on 7th sky is highly a rarity even at a place like LV. All hotels being booked due to XMas is similar thing..I mean, one event after another, it just seems like director is playing around with the story and manipulating it any which way to keep it going. It definitely could have been made a lot better if the story dept was a bit stronger.Now the acting: Kareena really did justice to her character, she brings life to her role as Raina, she looks like Geet of Jab we met migrated from Punjab to US..but of course, not as good as Geet herself. Imran looks natural and does well but he looks stereotyped for this role. Others support well. Ratna Pathak tries to make you laugh through her dialogs but she looks like she just came out from the Sarabhai vs. Sarabhai serial and uses her dialogs here..we need something new Ms. Pathak. Ram Kapoor is wasted in a small role..probably, advertising stunt due to his popular small-screen presence.Bottomline: Good acting but bad story/screenplay makes this yet another average movie of 2012 and keeps us waiting for a better show." 
" Worst Romantic Film","Worthless script, slow screenplay.. only 1 good song. Expression less Imran. Overacting of kareena 😢 disappointing movie."
