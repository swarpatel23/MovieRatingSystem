" Mithun's Typical B grade film","Mithun Chakraborthy was a brilliant actor from the 70s. He gave brilliant performances, acted in brilliant films, chose his films wisely. Even the 80s was good as hits followed and the critically acclaimed Wardat(sequel to Superhit Surkasha from 1978) released and became a superhit. Other multistarrer hits like Illaka and Watan Ke Rakhwale followed. Even some of his mainstream Bollywood films from the 90s like Pratigyaband, Kranti Kshetra, Aadmi and a few others followed. But suddenly, Mithun's films started flopping and after giving disasters like Shatrang, Jeevan ki Shatrang, and the washout Teesra Kaun, Mithun moved to Ooty and would only do films around there. This is when Mithun started doing B grade style films. These movies would contain bogus and nonsensical scripts, mindless south style action, and not to mention useless worthless garbage actresses. There would be some crude content and worthless item songs(songs would be garbage). Mithun had a record 200 films and out of these 200 releases 5 or 6 were hits while most were flops and disasters while some did average business.Bhairav is the same done to death typical B grade action movie where there is an overdose of violence, crude comedy and stupid dialogs. The movie is what Mithun had started doing after his shift to Ooty in 1995. His comeback to the mainstream was Elaan from 2005. Bhairav has probably one of the most typical stories of all these crap films. Rakesh Pandey has been employed, suddenly he is accused of murdering a girl, and he gets sentenced for some years. The stupidest part is the evidence makes no sense, it isn't enough to throw a man into prison. When he is released, he take revenge and kills the villain who is Jindal(Puneet Isaar). The film is so typical, so bloody typical it isn't worth watching. If you want to watch a decent Mithun movie watch Dance Dance, Disco Dancer or even his debut Mrigaya. I would also recommend a few of his movies from this nonsensical period. Jallad from 1995, Gunda from 1998, and even Hatyara from 1998 to an extent. Bhairav doesn't offer much, at the end of the day its the typical Mithun style action with B grade action moves and pop goes the villain. Don't expect much from this one it is another low budget disaster film from 2001."
