" Copy of groundhog day but still OK!","Within first 10 minutes I understood it was a indirect copy of movie groundhog day, where absolutely brilliant concept was executed in a equally brilliant way by brilliant actor Bill Murray. This movie though not brilliantly executed, is still a good entertainer and translation of the concept to make it digestible by Bollywood viewers is appreciable. Original movie groundhog day uses execution, sequences etc to convey messages while in this movie dialog serves as a means to make people understand messages that story wants it's viewers to get. I have been fan of Sachin's acting and have always liked and enjoyed movies with him in lead or a major role. And I enjoyed this movie too, I would have rated this movie at least 7/10 if the concept was original. Here due to the presence of Sachin I am rating not below 6. Seeing Anupam Kher's acting though I was very tempted to rate it around 2 or 3 out of 10" 
" A good adaptation from a Hollywood hit!","If you haven't figured it out from the synopsis yet, then you need to watch more movies!! This movie is a fairly good adaptation of Groundhog Day. That being said, the treatment of this movie has been changed to suit the Indian audience. The early parts of the film has flashes of Anupam Kher and it gets quite easy to figure out what is his role. I am not going to spell it out for you.At times it feels like the time loop is dragging a bit too much but you would have to keep in mind that it is not easy for a person to realize his/her faults and change overnight. But the change in mindset has been shown very well.The first few times that his day repeats, he is angry and upset and unable to explain to anyone what is happening. The next few times, he decides to live his life to the fullest knowing fully well that nothing will matter the next day.Post interval is when the story picks up. And that is when he enters the third phase which is realization.The only part which I didn't enjoy is the realization phase where it seemed more of dialogue with Anupam Kher & less of actually making amends with the people around him.The overall message is quite simple - we all live the each day over & over again with the only difference being that each day goes by a different name. We need to find our true purpose in life.Worth a watch."
