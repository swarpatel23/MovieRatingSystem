" Team The Force: Not much forceful, but still a time pass film...","Movie: Team The ForceRating: 2/5Let me tell you one thing. Despite of the fact that this is the first film I have seen in theatre, I had no plans of watching this film. I just wanted to see a film on big screen. I didn't even know about this film. When I watched it, I was not very impressed, but I found it an entertaining film, and rather, a time pass film.Sohail Khan gets a chance to do his best and he does it to some extent. Other few actors (I don't even remember their names) also do a passable work. The action is good. There are a few comedy bits that are entertaining. The story and screenplay are also OK. But the film has its cons as well.The music seems unnecessarily forced and doesn't even meet the category of an average music. The film doesn't have a very gripping storyline and you need to depend only on the 'masaledar' scenes of the film. Anyhow, the film entertains in parts and pleases the average viewer.Overall, Team The Force is a one time watch, if you are looking for some time pass sort of entertainment."
