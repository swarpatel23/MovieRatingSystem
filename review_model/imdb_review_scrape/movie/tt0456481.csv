" This is a movie that one should enjoy for its craziness, flamboyance and visual style.","Jaan-E-MannI liked Jaanemann, I loved Jaanemann, Jaanemann is in my blood!I have to admit, I had my doubts on a new director because you have no idea what to expect when you go into the cinema. Besides, I wasn't too keen on him after reading his interviews. But with all that set aside, from the very first reel, he stands out from the rest because of the way he sees his scenes. They are refreshingly different and unique. The man is an all-rounder. Hello? Director, Writer, Editor, Dialogues, Background Score, Promo direction... what can't this guy do? And I'm sure I'm still missing something! Technologically, its a film far superior than any other in Bollywood. The scene changes are spectacular... the colors are saturated in certain sequences to gain more visual appeal and the visuals used to express emotions are outstanding. Moreover, he's taken all cinematic liberties and they're all used so effectively!If you saw KHNH and KANK and thought that was all there is to New York. Wrong! Sudeep Chatterjee shows New York in a different light altogether. More scenes are done in the evening/night here rather than the broad daylight. Sabu Cyrill goes a step further and creates sets that further enhance the entire "Jaan-E-Mann" experience. Great job to both!Farah Khan's choreography shows us exactly where her heart is.... with Shirish Kunder. Her choreography flows SO well with the storyline and the screenplay. Its as if the body is meeting the soul because the songs are just an extension of the scene that precedes. No popcorn break here folks. Dialogues are placed within the songs and this is where teamwork really shines. Anu Malik, Gulzar, Farah, Shirish and the star cast have really worked together to make the music of this film shine. While Gulzar has penned perfect lyrics (yes! 'mom'; 'dad'; 'future' 'ignore' all make sense now!), Anu Malik has given the music a majestic feel and Shirish and Farah have worked well together to place the songs in the right moments and give the most suited choreography possible. The actors just flow with the direction and make the dream of Shirish and Farah come alive on the big screen. Don't believe me? See for yourself and be the judge. While talking about the songs, I must say that each and every one was presented in a completely different manner and held its own. One has to see the songs on the big screen to understand the importance of the lyrics, and the way the song is pictured. The performances: Piya Goel. Beautiful, Smart, Ambitious is she ... yet suffers from a lingering heartache. Though, there isn't much scope for her as an actress, Preity Zinta has still given it her all. She's cute as the popular college girl who cuts school to hang out with her bf, who is most probably a dropout. In NY, she's sophisticated, cultured and a sweet _______. Fill in the blank when you watch the film! ... and she really shines in the climax!Agastya Rao aka Champu. A dreamer in his own right. THEN, a geek with no clue on how to woo a girl. NOW, sophisticated, intelligent, a great catch .. but still no clue on how to woo a girl. Akshay Kumar attempts a role he's never done before and churns out such an endearing character, that you just can't let go of him. His full confidence and dependence in Suhaan shows through (especially towards the end where he becomes almost desperate) and the scene in front of the mirror is outstanding. Even when you leave the theater .. his "Huhh Huhh Huhh" laugh lingers in your head. Suhaan Kapoor. Selfish, over- confident, arrogant and pompous are just a few words that describe Suhaan. THEN a drop out student who only dreams big... NOW, he still dreams big... the only problem is, not much has changed from then and now. In fact, he's worse off now than before. The man can cry when affected because his heart deeply cares for those he loves. He blames the world at first and later only himself. This role is CUSTOM MADE for Salman Khan. Salman plays Suhaan to perfection. He takes digs at his own real life that no actor in his position would ever take. It really shows how comfortable he is in his own skin. The various characters that he takes on throughout the film are hilarious and really add to the flamboyance of entire canvas. In the second half of the film, you see a more sensitive Salman. The subtleness he keeps throughout really shows that he's in control of his character. His emotional scenes are outstanding. When he cries, you cry along with him because you understand the reasons for his mistakes. One of the highlights of this film is the chemistry between Salman and Akshay. They share such an AMAZING chemistry that not many actors tend to share. This film is miles ahead of Mujhse Shaadi Karogi in many ways. If you thought they gelled well in MSK, you'll be happy to know that the chemistry they share here is much much more. I hope they continue making films. Love the two together.This is a movie that one should enjoy for its craziness, flamboyance and visual style. Thie is one to be truly enjoyed on the big screen itself for all its grandness. It is an out and out Broadway show with plenty of glitz, glamor, musical numbers and talented performers. Ladies and Gentlemen .. after seeing this film .. I say .. ENCORE!! Yes, I'll be seeing this one again in the theater the next weekend." 
" jaanemann excelled- salman rocked","This is a story that grows into a story which makes you want to know what happens next as next scene is generated from the former but also portrayed as present.Shrish did a great job with this new innovation that it excelled. The music was fabulous and it follows in sequence according to the next picture..The Introduction was OK with Akshay and the blondie chatting introductingly about the next character (Suhaan) to be shown.I wouldn't say the movie was slow-paced from the beginning but rather would accept all the introductory aspect which shows you the theme of the film. The film went through all phases of emotions: from hilarious, to seriousness to sadness and pity and at the end joy...its amazing!The clause of it is just that the second part where the climax appeared was more peaked than the first part, but otherwise the scenes were shown in succession linking to the next without breaking.The way the three of the stars portrayed their character was good although not so much was given to 'Preity', but she excelled in the few she did and she really looked beautiful. Lots of chemistry between the stars. It was great..Akshay was really good, he amazed me with his character that depicts a good actor in every sense; and his chemistry with Salman is just too bonding..Anupam didn't have much to his credit, although he played his character well.Now Salman. He was the brilliance in this film. He was the one string that pulled the emotions in this film to the surface, all with his diversity..Even before the climax, as he was mentoring Agastya on how to woo Piya, you begin to pity his helplessness that turned him into a conman. And then you want know how its going to end, you want to know who gets the girl afterwards and everything Suhaan's been through irrespective of being Piya's ex-.The climax is so moving and Salman really drove home the message that you cant help but have a tear in your eyes; His character shows someone who is on the verge of losing what he most wanted but didn't know how to stop it. He was awesome!-The song 'sau dard hein' was too much to handle with the emotion going on with it and Salman did great justice to it, all the other songs were great too but this particular one superceeds the rest (my opininon).Overall the movie is worth a watch again after the first watch..Those who feel its not worthy, should watch it with unguarded heart- and feel what i am talking about, because it is a realistic story that can happen to anybody with feelings(Erase the comic aspect of it and see through the real occurrences)..." 
" Movie review: Jaan-E-Mann","I saw this on the first day itself.I was very excited to see Salman,Akshay and Preity on screen together coz the trailers itself looked appealing.So does Jaan-E-Mann disappoint? You betcha not! In fact,this movie makes the "love-triangle" saga seem new!First the movie starts off with Akshay kumar narrating the story of our three characters Suhaan,Ahgastya and Piya.The movie starts of well and makes the viewer interested.We follow the character's lives from present time to flashbacks in college.The first-half itself has its share of comedy moments but also sad ones as we learn about Suhaan and Piya's relationship.Then we follow Suhaan and Agastya to New York as Suhaan coaches Agastya to woo Piya.The scenes are beautiful and cinematography is excellent.The songs are melodious and beautifully picturised.OK now for the bad points...i felt that Anupam Kher's character was wasted.he had almost no significance in a role that actually wasn't easy to enact.Also,the second half of the film gets a bit draggy.Ironically,the director,Sirish Kunder is an editor for films..Performance wise Salman and Akshay are awesome.Both enact their parts with ease and great passion.Can't wait to see them on the big screen again.Both were amazing,its really difficult to pick one. Preity Zinta is BEAUTIFUL.Every single time she comes on screen,I was absorbed..she does justice to her role as Piya.One feels the director should have given her more scope..but she did well anyway.Overall,kudos to the main three leads! They are the heart and soul of Jaan-E-Mann.This flick is enjoyable from beginning to end.I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to have a good time with laughter and tears.Granted not all is perfect with the film as i mentioned earlier,but with so many positive points holing it together,who cares.Jaan-E-Mann is the type of film whereby when you see it once,you'd want to see it over and over again and it would be just as,if more enjoyable than the last time.So,yeah,go watch Jaan-E-Mann and have a good time!" 
" Jaan-E-mann rocks!","Jaanemann the best movie to complement this year's string of releases of the comedy film Lage Raho Munnabhai, the emotional drama KANK, and the action flick Don. While almost all Hindi films are on the musical side with plenty of dance and songs regardless of the relevancy to the films, Jaanemann is the only Bollywood musical executed the Broadway style.The cinematography has been creatively used to reflect story and development of the characters. Salman has been written off by the media continuously and each time he is back with a bang! Salman is definitely not a rock star, but a superstar! Nevertheless Akshay is never overshadowed, his character is a pioneer of such geeky personality in recent times. Preity, as always, is cute, and Anupam is so hilarious you keep asking for more! One does wonder how Salman has suddenly grown a full head of hair while Anupam's wig hairline is pretty obvious, but hey thats besides the point.The unconventional lyrics are explained by the way the story unfolds. The songs are hummable, and dances feature plenty of beautiful phirangi girls, fortunately this time they are well clothed, a rare departure from the usual half clad babes. This film is not for the critics, but for the light-hearted seeking for a feel good experience." 
" Great","THis movie is a movie that everybody should watch..it is fresh and appealing..it may be a bit dragging at times..but all in all it is a novel concept movie which will appeal to allot of people.. Preity Zinta is fantastic, she breaths fresh air in her role.. Akshay Kumar really surprises you as the geek, he just adds a new dimension of being the funny guy.. And Salman....this guy just took my breath away..I never saw the guy in this kind of role..you can see that he has worked hard on it..when I saw him crying..I knew that this time he was completely serious..Anumap Kher is funny as the midgetMusic is good, Story is novel.Worth every penny10/10" 
" Story old but good","This movie is another extension of series of movie made or to be made in bollywood on love triangle. The story line is old but successful.what i like about the movie is the treatment of the roles and its usefulness in the story. Firtstly i must congrats sallu miya for his another outstanding role in this movie .the role may shut the mouth of his critics who believe he is not actor.In nutshell he has justified the role as a rock star, as a die-hard lover and benevolent human being. his partner akshay though Short in role has done his job and made the movie Worth watching Priety Zinta not very attracting may her age has coming to her role as young lady she is good at dialog delivery,good at acting and overall justify the role Anupam Kher a legend in acting is amazing this movie is a work of romance go for it its good bye vinod" 
" Great use of special effects and lovely stars, excellent songs","This film was beautifully-done. It's very unique and unexpected to see dazzling special effects used in a romantic film (when they are usually only seen in action/violent ones). - Salman, Preity and Akshay were gorgeous and wonderfully entertaining, as was another favorite of mine, Anupam Kher (he was perfect in "Bride and Prejudice") -- although the attempt to make Anupam look like a 'little person' in his main role here didn't ring true and seemed unnecessary to the plot, and was not really humorous. - I liked the incorporation of the classic Cyrano de Bergerac device, having Salman feeding lines to Akshay to woo Preity (even though he loved her himself), and also the 'camera obscura' spying technique borrowed from the US film "Addicted to Love." One minor criticism I have is the use of British actors in the bit parts (with a line or two) who are supposedly Americans in New York; why was this done? Even if these scenes were filmed in Mumbai, surely a few real Americans could have been found for authenticity's sake. But do see it, if you love Hindi films as much as I do!" 
" superb movie","I watched this movie so i could be entertained, and was i? YES I WAS what a superb movie and superb directing from shirish kunder hats off to him and everyone else who was part of the movie. Salman and akshay were both absolutely amazing, priety was so gorgeous!!! The whole story was excellent and the flashbacks to the past where good to. The whole plot just leaves you guessing who will priety be with at the end i cant tell u that as that would spoil it for those who haven't seen it. As for the songs for me where excellent every single song was brilliant and this film just proves that salman and akshay are such an amazing pair, i hope to see more of them in the future. For those that have not seen this movie, go NOW it will not disappoint!" 
" Watch this movie, its worth every second.","Yet again the Salman and Akshay magic has created a DHOOM again. This movie is so simple made and yet so stylish and "Hatke se". Iam not gonna write about the story, that U can read everywhere else or just see the movie.Salman Khan has done a brilliant job again, he his caring this movie on his wide shoulders and giving the movie a special look and touch with his comedy and emotional role. "Salman Bhai tusi Great Ho"Akshay Kumar, what can I say he is one of Bollywoods most talented actors and with his personality and acting he has sure made a special place in our hearts, If u read this comment Akki then stick to comedy movies, these roles suits you and U do a brilliant job every single time.Pretty Zinta is very good too...still looking good and her acting is top notch. Anupam Kher is too funny, all the roles is done to perfectness and no role is forced in the movie.Hey Movie Viewers go and watch this movie and fall in love again its never over..:)" 
" Quality entertainment","jaan-e-mann is all about class and style.. it lives up to its name as the movie itself is a delight to watch .. for those who appreciate quality stuff, this one's a must.. the unique story-telling idea is not the only plus of the movie.. Salman's amazing get-ups, Akshay's geeky gestures and the wonderful backdrop of New York City are some of the major highlights that enhance the viewer's movie-going experience.. If you are a person who critizes every scene of a film, this one might not please your tastes.. but if you're like me who appreciates and understands creativity.. this one's a must because Shrish Kunder leaves you with a memorable movie to cheer about.. a movie that sets itself apart from anything seen before!" 
" Expectations were higher...","I went to see this film expecting something different, and fantastic. Jaan-e-Man IS different, but not exactly fantastic.The performances were good. Music: good. The dialogues, script, and plot were also just a "good". Its a really nice film, but truthfully, I was expecting more.Shirish Kunder does an average job for his first film. There are certain points though, which amaze you. E.g the whole "Sau Dard" song sequence - I was very impressed with that. The baby, is also cute. The story is a bit fairytale-ish, but I think it is courageous for Shirish Kunder to make a fairytale movie, especially when right now realistic cinema is all the rage.An interesting effort." 
" Solid by-the-book comedy-romance.","Solid by-the-book comedy-romance. Plus Preity Zinta stars!! (looking and acting fantastic.) I found the flash backs to cover the history of characters new and fun, and the same scene different point-of-view was nicely done! I loved the old smooth guy teaching the shy guy routine (higher technology, better range,etc.) Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar are very clear about their character and play them very honestly. As a divorced father I liked the fantasy that you could reconnect and remarry again, and live happily. The ending was wonderful. You can't say Bollywood does try new things: Anupam Kher playing a dwarf was also wonderful. I say these glowing things knowing the technological glitches were there. (I was raised on the real Star Trek (Spock/Kirk) so can allow for glitches in movie magic, while others harp on them and rate a movie poor for no reason.) They looked like they were having fun during the hypnotic song and dance number - and the audience and I laughed, so that's a good sign. Right? I say 8 out of 10, mainly because of PZ! She proved she's the best again at comedy-romance. P.S.She's pregnant again! HA! 5 movies. Does anyone else get pregnant in Bollywood? lol!" 
" a beautiful extravaganza","Those of you who have been grown up on bollywood stuffs are bound to dislike this movie, but for others all is not the same. If you like Broadway musicals that's an added advantage, cause then you won't fell weird as some of my fellow viewers were feeling. Jaan-e-man is a movie made straight from the heart. Imagine a director wearing additional caps such as screenplay,editing,dialogues,background score, one hell of an involvement,huh! I don't want to talk about the story as it is clear from the promos,it is a two guys in love with the same woman. It is in the execution the beauty of this movie lies. Also the performances are terrific. The film requires stars, not actors to carry these roles and the director couldn't have get much better. If you ever loved someone in your life, and you like to see movies, this is the movie for you. This diwali clearly belongs to Jaan-e-man. Small centers may go gaga over the glossy DON but this is a movie which would remain in hearts of people.The blemishes, Anupam Kher despite of his funny get-up he is just not funny. The sparkle, Salman, he is the superstar, the most handsome hero bollywood has ever produced." 
" Zinta is definitely a Jaan-è-mann","Director Sirish Kunder has made a commendable debut in Hindi cinema as a director. This editor-turned-director has made an impressive attempt to make Jaan-è-mann what it is. Superb editing, exotic locales and a heart warming love story. I had never imagined that special effects could be of such an imperative to a romantic love story. This movie delivers the best in technicality. Scene transitions are superb, dream sequences, going into and out of flashback has its own style and the film is full of jolly and merry instances. But all that does not make a movie great if it lacks its soul, the screenplay. Sirish Kunder, in his first screen writing attempt, has clearly shown his incompetence and inexperience.Kunder, though has filled the film with lots of one-liners, pretty catchy dialouges and an amazing score, technically the script has pitfalls. Lack of adequate character conflicts, the trait of the film gone missing somewhere and, and most importantly, a novice screenwriter makes the movie lose its charm. Jaan-è-mann could be a thoroughly entertaining if we set the screen writing rules aside, but beyond that, if you're planning to watch a movie by experienced professionals, this one is definitely not your cup of tea.Lets look at various aspects one by one:Salman Khan - Good performance. Thank god he's given up laughing like hyena. We see veteran in this movie. A sad an miserable shade of his character makes home in public's heart.Preity Zinta - After KANK, she's my ultimate favourite. This angelic beauty looks great throughout and she's still watchable as a college girl. And my God, she does great Russian accent. Akshay Kumar - I like the way he laughs, he..hee..heee. Akshay has come a long way into romantic comedy from action movies and he's good at it. He's in fact good in any character he gets into.Anupam Kher - This one actor knows the heights of performance, although he plays a person without, um.. much height.Anu Malik - The track "Humko Maloom" is great. Fabulous. But not all songs are ones we can say "are really great." Worked late night and wrapped up in a haste?Gulzar - Is he trying to be different or did the producers ask him to do so? Why does he need to use so many English words in songs? I feel bad calling a veteran bad but he fails to live up to the expectations.Farah Khan - Great. At least this is the best she can give to her newlywed husband Sirish Kunder. She's put her heart and soul into it making choreography one of the strongest aspects of this movie.Sirish Kunder - Editing - superb! Space sequence - superb! Visual transitions - superb! Should definitely go ahead and make more movies. But before that, I urge him to buy the book "Screenwriting" by Syd Field and read it once.Apart from this, the production design is laudable. The baby who plays Preity Zinta's daughter is really sweet. Enormous curtains hanging down from the roof look exhilarating. New York, as always is breathtaking. What's even good is the actors' chemistry and the way the entire movie has been set up.If you're finding it hard to choose between Don and Jaan-è-mann, my choice would definitely be Jaan-è-mann. It's a value for money but not yet the film I can call the best film of the year." 
" Enjoyable but flawed!!","I saw Jaanemann after Don and I must say I enjoyed it.But as I always say why drag it on for almost 3 hrs .... when a tight 2hrs 20 min would have been more than enough. The story is the eternal love triangle but done in a fresh and innovative way by the first time director Kunder. He uses a novel approach with innovative flashbacks and song sequences to tell the story. The first song with Salman was well picturised and was used as a means to tell the flashback without boring the viewer. Flashback scenes were nicely done and using perspectives of all the three main players. Also had a couple of nice twists, one of them in the second half was especially good in providing a valid reason behind the changing relationship between salman and preity.The acting... for me the most likable was Akshay with his goofy laugh. Excellent acting and get up for the nerdy role. PLus excellent chemistry with Salman Khan. But Salman was also quite good and don't be fooled... this is a salman khan movie all the way. He changed gears nicely playing the college rocker then the no-good husband/akshays mentor and finally the reformed husband with elan. He even cried and looked sad through out the latter half without going over the top. Is it me or did Preity Zinta have nothing to do in this movie except look great in her western outfits and appear in all the songs.. i did not think so. In one of the songs they used a cardboard cutout of hers and i think it would have played her role in the rest of the movie as well.MInor spoiler - Why oh Why did Anupam Kher have to play a midget and why did he have to have a double role... one role could have been played by another actor and there was no need for a midget at all. It was a bit cheap plus it did not look even remotely convincing as Kamal Hassan's midget act in '' Appu Raja'' almost 15 yrs ago. PLus why do all the foreigners in the movie speak with an Aussie accent if they are supposedly in New York? Music was melodious.. good qawwali type number and the song 'Ajeeb' was pretty good. Song picturisation was the usual New York thing although the first song was done in the old Hollywood musical style with some beautiful and elaborate sets.Shirish Kunder wore many hats for this production as he was in charge of direction, story, dialogues, and editing. Probably the one that did not stand up to the test was editing which by the way was how he made his living before this movie.... could have trimmed another 20 minutes from the movie easily by getting rid of most of the midget. Anyway he has done his best to make a different product and I'm sure he'll do better in other projects. He did go a bit overboard with the CGI in some scenes but kudos to him and best of luck for the future.This movie is definitely worth a watch." 
" Jaan-e-Mann is an amazing movie","It is not often that two colossal movies collide on the same date. This Diwali was such a date. A week when the giants of the industry in Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan met however, in this case one of the movie being JAAN-E-MANN prevailed while Don faltered. Jaan-e-Mann was great!! Everyone acted awesome! Salman Khan was AMAZING! He demonstrated his emotional side in this movie! Akshay Kumar and Preity Zinta were good too. But Salman Bhai out shined them both! Compared to this movie, DON sucked!!! Watch Jaan-e-Mann instead! it is definitely worth it! So ya the movie was great. The movie is basically: Salman Khan wants to be a rock star While Akshay Kumar works for NASA Preity Zinta is just a regular person. Then the three meet. It is definitely a must see! i would give it a 20/10 (if possible)!"
