" Non sense comedy","I just cant imagine how anybody can make movie this much bad, No story, Lame jokes, Unreal situations. The humor in Rascals is too loud and often unfunny while Kangna Ranaut is too hysterical and dumb-headed to evoke all the trouble and attention. Okay, so dumbness can be excused in Bollywood comedies which ostensibly revel in low IQ gags. Complete waste of time and money. All Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan do in the movie is just stick to Kangana Ranaut. Movie reminds me of Deewana Mastana (which was much more superior as compared to Rascals) On the flip side, in the second half, there are some unnecessary sequences that only add to the length in this over the top comedy. A word of advice to Kangna. Stick to serious roles and stay away from comedy." 
" I got tickets for cheap and I feel I wasted that money too.","3 starts to Kangana, Ajay and refreshing Arjun Rampal.I want to start with praise to Arjun who has don a seriously good role and looking apart in the movie. Rest of the movie is full of crap, vulgar and cheap comic shots, which I don't know which category of people like.I could not believe David Dhawan, who was the reason for me to agree for this movie. He use to make sense earlier, till interval, you will wonder where is the movie going to?? What they want?? and What is going to happen next?? Just vulgar and cheap shots one after another.I would not recommend this movie.Regards" 
" This is one movie that you go in with the thought, 'These rascals might be entertaining' and come out with the thought, 'Was that entertainment? Bloody rascals!'","We went into this movie with the thought that this might actually turn out to be nice. The promos released were kind of attractive and showed that this might be a refreshing comedy. Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn, not the biggest stars around but good actors nonetheless added to the hype and yet what we got was nothing but pure lame, pointless, idiotic and humor that doesn't do justice to its definition.This is one movie that you go in with the thought, 'These rascals might be entertaining' and come out with the thought, 'Was that entertainment? Bloody rascals!'David Dhawan has given us a number of comedy flicks in the past and most of them, more often than not have worked. This one doesn't come even close to being the best and doesn't come close to be called as good humor either!The story line doesn't make sense or in fact there isn't a story line at all!Heights of over acting are on display by all the three leads, namely, Ajay Devgn, Sanjay Dutt and Kangna Ranaut (who I personally hate as an actor).The movie opens with a set of 2D animations for the credit which was innovative yet pointless. Throughout the movie there is this constant rhyming going on dialogue after dialogue which we presume is to make them funny but are plain lame and don't came close to make them funny. The character names for Sanjay Dutt (Chetan) and Ajay Devgn (Bhagat) are supposed to in some way make some kind of mocking at Chetan Bhagat but I doubt it was anywhere near being successful in doing so.The plot too is stale and there is no twist whatsoever to catch your eye but well you can't expect that from an Indian comedy unless making light of poverty, charity, handicap or a sexed-up version of Andaz Apna Apna meets Jodi No 1 meets Deewana Mastana meets Bluffmaste is your idea of a joke, those laugh lines won't budge.Sadly, Bollywood comedies thrive on double meanings but that too has gotten so stale that it rarely brings a laugh. The fact is the over acting rises to heights that it doesn't appears that it is supposed to make you laugh! Throughout the movie, there were punches being delivered by the rascals on screen but they were so stale, so boring, and not even worth calling a PJ. The writer should be delivered all the punches back and in a different sense altogether!It made us laugh just once throughout the movie and that scene too wasn't as funny to leave a mark for I have been racking my brain to remember what it was and yet I fail!It made us laugh at another point though but it was not because of the on screen rascals, it was because of a couple of off screen rascals who were talking of breaking the LCD of the theater, yes 'THE LCD' when the sound went off for some reason. Those guys were funnier than the on screen rascals.Some of my friends can be funnier than these rascals!Coming to the acting bit, well I, on a personal level am a fan of Sanjay Dutt's work and Ajay Devgn has impressed in the last couple of movies but yet, as stated there has been too much of over acting and well, with a script like that, no one can make the movie funny in any way whatsoever. I won't talk about Kangna Ranaut for I hate her hence I might get a bit biased and a bit too negative. About Lisa Haydon or Hayden whatever her name is, she has been portrayed as a prostitute and that's her character! All in all, this is one movie that can easily give competition to Double Dhamaal which I had already presumed to be the worst comedy Bollywood movie of the year, but this one has surely given Double Dhamaal a strong competition. Even a no brainer should have some sort of sense and this one has nothing to offer!We give it a, I don't know, it might be a bit too much for the movie but still a 0.3/5 just for that scene which made me laugh and yet I fail to remember!In short, pure bullshit and a waste of time and money!" 
" Bad and Cheap","The story is really bad and nonsense. Yes, I know these kind of movies are supposed to be light-hearted and fun and not make much sense too but come on! The comedy part is not funny at all (a man pretending to be blind looking at a girl change her clothes = comedy in this movie). Comedy nowadays in Bollywood means vulgarity and cheap jokes. Where are those good old funny movies which actually made you laugh. And pairing Sanjay Dutt with Kangana; seriously? Kangana was trying really hard to be funny but in vain. Ajay is okay. Only good part (very little though) was Arjun Rampal's guest appearance. That's it. DOn't watch the movie (atleast not in a hall). Awful!!" 
" It's an Average Comedy movie without any story","Rascals is an average comedy film without any proper story. Chemistry between Sanjay Dutt(as Chetan) and Ajay Devgn(as Bhagat) is good. Item Song of Lisa, Shake it Saiyaan is only part of movie which you can enjoy in Rascals. Glamor and beauty of Kangana will hold you during the film. Acting of Arjun Rampal is also good. But allover the movie is not with proper story and script. Direction of movie is good. But script and story of Rascals doesn't make any sense. Some funny punches will make you laugh, but its not enough for a complete film. I think, its onetime watch movie. You will not get satisfaction of watching a good movie after watching Rascals." 
" Rascals is a headache!","RascalsMore Pics David Dhawan was the pioneer of the farcical films genre with the kind of comedies he made through the 90s. However mindless his films might have been, it still had an inherent sense of humour and assured a few good laughs. Sadly, in the subsequent decade, all he served in the name of stress-free slapsticks is noise and commotion. While we aren't demanding that the filmmaker upgrade with times, all we expect is that the one-time king of comedy merely maintain his original brand of humour. Is that asking for too much? Rascals is what one can call a 'vacation' filmmaking stint where everyone works on the film as if they were on a 'holiday' and the audience is expected to 'leave' their senses behind. The actors make least efforts to add conviction to their performances and the patchy writing just allows them to play as they please. Invariably the director tries to camouflage the shallowness in the story by adding depth only in the decibel levels of the dialogue delivery. So you have conmen Chetan (Sanjay Dutt) and Bhagat (Ajay Devgn) in one- upmanship game to win the girl (Kangana Ranaut) loaded with assets (both financial and physical). It's never clear what they love more - her body or her bank-balance. And their lecherous rivalry only seems to be about who would get to hug the cleavage-popping girl more number of times. One-upmanship has been a popular plot for several comedies since the times of Amitabh Bachchan - Shashi Kapoor's Do Aur Do Paanch (1980). Even David Dhawan had smartly handled the concept in his earlier comedies like Govinda-Anil Kapoor's Deewana Mastana (1997) and Akshay- Salman's Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Unfortunately it doesn't quite work this time, primarily because Kangana Ranaut doesn't share any chemistry with either men and so their persistent pursuit to get the girl falls flat. Also thanks to the dull camaraderie, the viewer never really bothers which hero would actually win the heroine in the end. Thereby the small surprise in the climax (no, there isn't a cameo by a third hero) also doesn't register much. The storytelling in the animated title credits is more appealing than the conventional narrative structure. While one has already left logic behind, the problem is that Yunus Sejawal's screenplay is inconsistent, convenient and uneventful. It lacks the imagination or wit for some real exciting clash between the male leads. One can easily see through most of the worn-out gags. Sanjay Chhel's synchronized rhyming dialogues are occasionally funny but seem forced otherwise. You laugh more on the corniness of the scenes than the comedy per se. The tone of humour is consistently loud and commotional. Expectedly Ajay Devgn keeps screaming most of the time and hams outrageously. Sanjay Dutt is better in comparison, which isn't saying much. He gets the funnier lines, gags and scenes. Kangana Ranaut is ill at ease in comedy. She struggles to hold her own and emerges as a bimbo in her act. Lisa Haydon is merely employed to look hot and she does a fair job at it. Hiten Paintel is used as an add-on and his presence in the film is immaterial. Satish Kaushik attempts to induce few laughs with his gibberish brand comedy. Bharti Achrekar gets no scope. Chunky Pandey overacts. Arjun Rampal has pretty much nothing to do. Rascals ends up being a silly and stupid comedy!" 
" Sadly David both copies and disappoints once again.","David Dhawan directing a film called RASCALS with Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan in comic roles was indeed a promising news. The promos looked good and few songs were also being noticed. But this was the scenario only before the release of the film and now after watching it I have a completely different story to tell quite sadly.In the past, David Dhawan has been accused many times of copying from both the Foreign as well as our own Indian movies. Plus he was also into using the double meaning dialogues and songs to win over his viewers in those successful years of films featuring Govinda and Karishma Kapoor. Unfortunately in his latest venture too, David doesn't move away from his same old overused path and continues to use both these formulas in RASCALS in a rather disappointing way.Firstly, writing his extremely weak storyline, the director and his writers take all their inspiration from an English Classic "Bedtime Story" (1964) which also revolves around two con-men trying to fool a rich lady and which was again remade as "Dirty Rotten Scoudrels" in 1988. Adding his own contribution in the script, David changes a wheel chair ridden imposter (in the Original films) into a fake blind man (Ajay Devgan) in RASCALS. But then later on strangely returns to the wheel chaired man again in the end as a loyal follower of the original. Interestingly this same plot and many similar sequences were earlier copied by Bollywood in three films namely, "Johar Mehmood in Hongkong" (1971), "Khel" (1992) and then partially in the famous "Andaz Apna Apna" (1994).Secondly this time, David goes even further in using the double meaning dialogues along with a lot of skin show by both Kangna and Lisa in the film. In fact, the sequences and dialogues used in these particular sequences even surpass all his previous films and can be easily termed as 'Vulgar', which usually work in the smaller centers. The film starts off well with a better first half but in the later reels it gives you many unwanted boring scenes like the one in the deserted church with Satish Kaushik. So, with very few enjoyable comedy sequences, RASCALS is not able to deliver as per the expectations raised by all the talented names in its team. David stumbles several times in his script and direction. Soundtrack only gives you few catchy double meaning raunchy numbers as usual. The ladies are only there to shed off their clothes just at the word "Go". The supporting cast continuously hams in their badly written roles. And the leading heroes tend to shout more than act in the whole film. Though both Ajay and Sanjay have successfully played many comical characters in their recent films, but the same cannot be said for RASCALS.In short David Dhawan's new madcap entertainer is surely mad but strictly not entertaining as per its promises made. But if you are really interested in con-men films then do watch both "Bedtime Story" and "Dirty Rotten Scoudrels" to know the difference in treatment given to the plot by their respective directors." 
" spicy movie if u like extra mirchi this ones for you!","Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn play two cool con men trying to outdo each other. The competition reaches an all-new level when both fall for the same girl, the pretty and petite Kangna Ranaut, and both men constantly attempt to outmanoeuvre each other to win her. Sanju and Ajay work together with an exuberant and high spirited ease and that, surely, is a joy to watch. Even though Sanju has been doing comedies ever since the beginning of his career, it has only been in the last few years that Ajay has discovered his funny bone, courtesy films like GOLMAAL series, ALL THE BEST and DIL TOH BACCHA HAI JI. The comic timing of the two actors is simply fantastic! Sanju and Ajay work together with an exuberant and high spirited ease and that, surely, is a joy to watch.

The comic timing of the two actors is simply fantastic!" 
" The worst comedy of 2011!","Rascals directed by David Dhawan is just abysmal,boring,cheap,vulgar and offensive.Talented actors like Ajay Devgn(Singham:2011),Arjun Rampal(Ra.One:2011,Kangana Ranaut(Tanu Weds Manu:2011)and Sanjay Dutt(Munnabhai series) have been wasted in this movie.There is not even a single joke that will make you laugh.Some jokes in the first and second hour to the extent will make you smile! What makes me give this hopeless movie 2 stars is for Arjun Rampal and Kangana Ranaut.Arjun Rampal shines in the movie as Anthony Gonzalves and Kangana looks fresh! Story:-Chetan Chauhan (Sanjay Dutt) and Bhagat Bhosle (Ajay Devgn) are petty thieves who have run from India to Bangkok.In Bangkok,they plan to loot a rich girl Khushi (Kangana Ranaut).Both try to upstage each other in wooing her.While in India,Anthony Gonzalves (Arjun Rampal),is searching for Chetan and Bhagat since they have looted him of his car and money.The comedy scenes are offensive and cheap.David Dhawan known as King of Comedy movies,should now be known King of Cheap Comedies.(earlier being Do Knot Disturb) The dialogs are unfunny.The music is average.The story is nothing to talk about.Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn are disappointing.Kangana Ranaut is cute and fresh-looking.Arjun Rampal is the best of all.Chunky Pandey and Satish Kaushik are saddening.All in all,Rascals is a disaster!" 
" They think that people r so dumb they will make what ever and earn money","What a bad movie , I wasted my rs 40 , Sandy should pay me to watch his movie , so bad comedy , geese potty comedy dialogs , unfunny, childish ,comedy ,forced comedy then also you will not laugh , you will feel guilty why i watched this film . I am really angry , many of them were waiting movie to end , but it never ends.many people where angry there in theater , I regret so much, even if I watched this movie for rs 40 I still feel I wasted so much money on this , time and my brain because of these torture they should pay us rs 400 to watch these movie , some where spitting on screen and some one was going to P I S S. on the screen because of the torture that movie gave but others stopped him , i have better stayed at home and watched Comedy serials or other comedy serial better then spending so much money , or have spend time with friends , or see force or gangster, SOUNDTRACK is awesome movie." 
" So ridiculously bad","Im still not sure how I ended up seeing this movie, but here I am thinking of the film that stands next to Double Dhamaal as the worst of 2011. Seriously, it is that bad. Reasons? For One, there is hardly a plot, but old, cliché gimmicks to create a Partner feel in two Rascals story. Two? The cast themselves. Now we already know how Kangana has modeled herself on some western woeful pictures from day one, but Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan is in way over their head. And worse still, someone like Arjun Rampal turns in for a very poor cameo. Lastly? Does it work? No. It does not. I don't care if people write reviews stating that a lot of reviewers won't admit they liked the picture. I absolutely hated it.I just want to say this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The character Kangana played, talks pure crap. Every word coming out of her mouth just seems to make me angry, because it sounds like she is trying really hard to sound cool and smart. She just unloads so much non-sense that it make watching the film torture." 
" Horrible","Why on earth did David Dhawan make such a nonsense? The film makes Haseena Maan Jayegi look like a classic. It's so stupid it makes you cringe Ajay Devgn after Singham returns with such a crap, while Sanjay Dutt too has done better comedy before, both are named Chetan and Bhagat(please!) The film has Kangana who is given her worst role ever It also has Arjun Rampal The comedy is so purile, so boring, so stupid that it makes you cringe DD also has scenes borrowed from his earlier films like a blind fake act scene from HMJ. Direction by David Dhawan is bad Music is badAmongst actors Ajay Devgn is never known much for his comedy timing and tries too hard but falters, Sanjay Dutt who is becoming a regular in such films gives a bad performance, being overweight too does him disservice Kangana annoys with her winny delivery Arjun Rampal is wasted, rest are nothing great" 
" Review: Money Wastage","It is totally a pathetic movie.If you wanna waste your money then do watch this movie.This movie has no story line.Senseless comedy which doesn't make any sense anytime.David dhawan has again given a big disappointment to the bollywood.CRAP MOVIE.Don't go for this, you gonna simply watse your money.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Not at all a comedy movie but a stupid and idiotic movie.Every Character in the movie has played a crap role.Highly Disappointed." 
" 2 thumbs up","This movie was so totally entertaining and hilarious movie and entertaining I enjoyed it and loved this movie very well Songs they are really impressive background music is superb Storyline was superb screenplay was superb editing was superb direction was superb Ajay devgn is superb Sanjay dutt is superb Arjun is superb kangana is superb Lisa is superb Overall my rating is 8/10 or 4/5 stars"
