" RGV continues to rock","I just came out from the premiere show @10PM in PVR, Bangalore. RGV has done it again. I guess once again he has given 2 successful films back to back (Shiva & Kshana Kshanam, Company & Bhoot, Sarkar Raj & Contract). This time he's so cleaver in choosing the subject. He has just given the right film at the right time. Just how it happened to Jaane Tu.. Even though its not so great time, people are prejudiced already prepared to make the film a big hit. Same thing happened here. I have not expected an outstanding film. I (we) liked RGV with Sarkar Raj, with his next film, he just needed to make me (us) not to get bored of it.Of course, the film starts with a boring note, which picks up speed eventually, and that is the best part of the film. As he finished the boring scenes at the starting, there's no chance for dipping down in the middle. Upendra Limaye, who's impressed us as Kanthilal Vora (not Vhora), this time steals the show as Goonga. Zakir Hussain, and Prasad Purandhare looked fatter compared to their previous films (Sarkar, Ab tak Chappan) and fatten their acting skills also. Sakshi Gulati is impressive and I'm pleasantly could live with RGV's tight closeups n this is where Adhvik Mahajan failed.RGV's tight closeups would work with powerhouses like batchchans. They kinda challenge them to bring the best out of them. But it falls flatten when it comes to these newbies. This RGV's new hero could not be spontaneous as he did not given an options to cover his to be groomed facial expressions with his body language. Thanks to RGV as they are less compared to Sarkar Raj. Background Score, RGV must be missing Sandeep Chouta badly. If not, now he must start. Though its not too pale, as RGV reminds us about Satya and Company, comparisons are inevitable. First thing that struck my mind is Background Score. I so liked Sandeep Chouta in Satya, I had purchased the soundtrack cassette of Satya then. When it comes to Company, sometimes I's confused like who is elevating the scene? is it RGV's direction or Chouta's score. I cant forget the score where it muting Mohan lal's gyan to Vivek oberai in hospital after he's shoot. It continues for couple of minutes so many thing happening on screen. In Contract Amar Mohile's score's completely out of sync in some scenes and it sounds like from some Ekta kapoors TV serial. I think now RGV mastered the art of making climax interesting. Though it is not as great as Sarkar Raj, it still manages to hold your attention till the last frame. Despite the excusable flaws for this small budgeted film, RGV's direction sparkled, especially in the middle of the water. Upendra Limaye reminded me of Kota srinivasarao in Gaayam. Amruta Subhash is so lively at the same time so touching when Goonga dies. Over all, a good entertainer. RGV has come a long way since Satya in terms of story telling. Thats why you could sit through the movie without any Bhiku or Chandu kinds. Two less to ten, one for hero and one for Background score. I always wonder why RGV takes so much care of minute details even. Check this scene where Dara comes to a movie theater to kill someone. Screen is not shown but you can hear Jack Nicholson uttering the dialogs from The Departed, which could be related to Contract. Go for it." 
" RGV never had the grip on the movie!","RGV's latest movie "Contract" tries to throw all its flaws straight on your face. It is just so easy to pick so many of them in movie.First of all poor star cast; absolutely! None of them had a hold on their characters. So much so, many of the characters make you feel they were not required at all - like the gangster's wife - damn what was she trying to portray? the martial arts specialist's role was crap. I even feel the commissioner's role was enacted without even a basic level of stature.Shabby dialogues and one-liners; Most of actors tried too much to show thinking(staring?)faces(Sarkar Style) and say one liners as if they are trying to remember their dialogues! The lead character and his love interest need professional training in acting. Even some of the dialogues are so short and stupid even kids will find them laughable such as..."It's a secret!?" Now, I truly believe... one liners or punch dialogues can be pulled off only by seasoned actors.Poor background music and soundtrack; They were the hallmarks of cult movies like Satya and Company - but for contract it is big thumbs down.The Plot; The start of the movie itself rushes the concept to the viewer so fast that you immediately know how the story is going to end like... and that's it... you loose interest and wait to watch who is worst actor among the cast.Sadly, RGV's magic shows have run out of tricks. Gone are the glory days. I still hope RGV will comeback with a masterpiece like Satya." 
" One time watch","It's not great but decent movie to watch. I liked it. No big stars so not so good reviews and also no promotion done." 
" awesome plot.....should have worked great with a better lead actor","RGV is back with a thriller..... If you liked satya, vastaav or company...this is the right movie for you. The plot is very interesting full of twists and turns. The lead actor has done a nice job, but the film would have worked well with a better experienced actor. The new face sakshi gulati(Iya) looks stunning..the movie is based on the terrorism in India and its links with the underground world. To deal with terrorism, the actor(who works with police) becomes a mafia member himself changing his identity. The underground world is impressed by his work and make him a part of their gang.The terrorists now want to target a major city and they want the best person to do the job, so they hire the actor(a mafia i disguise). The ending is superb.. the whole movie keeps you glued to your seats.THE FILM IS A MUST WATCH FOR RGV FANS." 
" Really pathetic. Bakwas!","Actors are bad. Story is weak. Dialogues are dull and boring.
Not very convincing plot.
Gang war, don, hero losing wife and kid in a blast, infiltrator, love affair etc. You get the gist pretty quickly.
The loud mouth guy who owns a posh yacht is a totally misplaced character.He keeps making noise about being the king of Mumbai. Keeps sending some dud assassins to kill his rivals and always fails. How can such a guy be worth anything? And then the hero comes and kills him like killing a fly. No conflict, no fight, nothing! A very pathetic subplot.
The usual ugly, bearded, scary looking terrorists are shown as dumb as a doorknob.
Ram Gopal Verma should stop making movies and find something else to do.
Extremely weak and predictable plot.
In order to show the hero to be tha master, they shown the rest of crew to be so stupid that the whole story becomes laughable. There is one encounter man. Without establishing him as anyone worthy, they have shown him running around naked, being chased by the hero, then grabbing a saree from a mannequin and trying to put it on. All very poorly done.
Stay away from this movie." 
" not so good","Movie is about a covert operation to kill sultan who happens to be one of the terrorist group leaders. ( We don't talk about the message of the movie as RGV says that he is not interested in any messages through films )Not much research went into knowing how a covert operation is done ? Secret. Director should have referred to "Drohkaal". Director concentrated on clearly presenting how the hero is placed in villains gang. It looked pale when the hero keeps informing to police officer on phone all the time. Is thats how mafia deals with the people inside the group??? Secret.Background music was scary. Varma " have u seen the movie in mute?? "??? Secret. What i liked most in the movie is acting. Every did their best. Goonga's wife,RD and RD's sister are the top performers in this movie. That saves the grace of the movie and can be watched for it." 
" Still Waiting for RGV's old spirited form.","Ram Gopal Verma returning with his third underworld film, after "Satya" & "Company" was indeed a great news which raised the expectations level again from the master film-maker after his recent "Sarkar Raj".But all the expected standards were shattered and nothing new and impressive was there in his Trilogy movie "Contract" featuring all newcomers. 10 minutes into the movie and you know that RGV again has come up with a product not matching his own standards set in the past.The plot was partly similar to "Departed" and was also quite predictable for an underworld movie. Putting a spy in the Terrorists Gang and then tracking their plans is what we have already seen numerous times in Bollywood movies.The criminal characters and their presentation, resembled RGVs own "Company" to a huge extent. Like the female accompanist in the gang was exactly the same as Manisha Koirala with Ajay Devgan. The debutant Prasad has just played the role with no conviction. Zakhir Hussain was loud in his scenes.RGV has got a great creative film-maker in himself, but in recent times he seems to be lost his way. Especially in the music department, as music of almost all his recent films have gone unnoticed. As I see it, new unexploited plots are the key point to have him back in form. Underworld movies should be given a break and may be a musical comedy like "Rangeela" can give us back our good old Ram Gopal Verma.Still Waiting for RGV to get back in form again! Sadly it was not this time." 
" Good Movie by Varma","This movie is hundred times better than scum banchod suvvar rat movies like "Three idiots" "Dabhanng". This is about a banchod suvvar rat Sultan that bombs children, hospitals. Like any Suvvar rats he lives in a sewer and plots the bombs. Varma cleverly exposes the story behind these scum banchods who live in the gutter eating scum and kill innoncent people. The lead actor Satya displays his anger well but he does not emote well. The other actors are OK. The banchods who are born in some filthland and come to India and plot these attacks. The movie shows how these scums are slaughtered like dogs and Varma is one of the Best Film makers and all his movies are not in the same caliber but they are hundred times better than these Anti Indian Madarchets suvvar banchods are producing for example movies like "laggan"."
