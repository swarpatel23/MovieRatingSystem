" Good movie.","Cool movie. If you have nothing to do, watch this movie. This movie will neither make you laugh, nor will it make you cry. But you'll be smiling throughout the movie. This college romance flick is good for a lazy afternoon. Amrita Rao looks pretty and fits in perfectly in her character. Shahid Kapoor needs to watch his steps, all through the movie he tries to imitate ShahRukh Khan. Shahid, be yourself! Your way too good to be impersonating someone else. Shenaz needs to press down the attitude, you're just a newbie babe. Don't act like you've conquered Bollywood. You still have a long way to go. And yeah, What's with the weird accent?? And lastly, this review would be incomplete without mentioning Vishal who has done a wonderful job as a faithful Rambo! Also Satish Shah and Neelima Azim (whos Shahids real-life mom too) have done a great a job." 
" Archie/Betty/Veronica visit Bollywood","Ishq Vishk is "Archie/Betty/Veronica" in Bollywood. The story is pretty stale and has been made practically in each decade since the inception of Bollywood. How-ever Ishq Vishk is the movie for current decade - set in contemporary times with fresh approach relevant to todays world and portrayed using new faces, which is what makes the movie click.How Shahid Kapoor drops the cute-next-door-girl, Amrita Rao for hot-girl with an attitude Shehnaz. The rest of the movie is the journey of our hero's realisation and return to the true love.The movie is draped with melodious hummable songs, dances, funny comic scenes, teenagish one-liners. The movie is targetted towards teenagers and the director does not falter in this aspect. This movie is perfect debut vehicle for Shahid Kapoor. His has what it takes to be. Perfect body, good dancing skills and firm dialog delivery (though reminds me of Javed Jaffery's voice at times!). Amrita Rao plays the innocent girl convincingly and walking away with audience's compassion. Shehnaz Tresurywalla is just-okay types. Satish Shah and Neelima Azeem (Shahid Kapur's real-life Mom) provide good support. Both the actor and director are to watch out for." 
" A fun and romantic movie!!","I love this movie so much. It's fresh and fun, and not to mention hilarious, with catchy songs. Shahid and Amrita are also the most perfect couple ever! Amrita's character Payal is easily related to and believable. Everyone does a great job, especially Vishal! This is a movie for young people, not something you would watch with parents or kids. It's not a life changing classic, but a fun chick-flick that I will always watch from time to time. You also get to see a really young Shahid as this is his first movie. This movie will be treasured by all "shamrita fans" like me. =) Watch it if you want a good laugh and good chemistry." 
" Storyline from 60's repeated again in 21st century","Yesterday, I watched the movie "Ishq Vishq" for the first time on TV, and was surprised to see how this movie was hit or popular?It is not that it is a bad movie, or I would have never watched the movie completely. But what is surprising is that there is no storyline to tell, or even if it has the story, it is the same old story - same case of old wine in new bottle. Boy meets girl in college, here it is the turn of boy to reject girl's feelings, and then ultimately coming to terms. So what is new here?The movie has the feeling of "deja vu" in its entire run. In 60s, Shammi Kapoor (and his clones) tried to woo Asha Parekh on tunes of OP Naiyyar, in 70s it was turn of Rishi Kapoor to gyrate on Pancham's tunes, in 90s, it was turn of Aamir Khan / Akshay Kumar and Madhuri Dixit (and others) to romance on tunes of Anand Milind/Nadeem Shravan / Jatin Lalit. And now, in 2004, you have Shahid KapoorThe most irritating part is the never changing psychological profile of girls in the movie. Even in the year of 2004, they are as "pativrata" as their black and white counter parts (Meena Kumari in white saari singing a Bhajan in front of Lord Krishna). The girls are foolish enough to fall in love, when the guys fake their feelings towards them, just to get some favour. It feels they haven't learnt anything from their mothers and grand mothers. Falling in love is so easy for them.And for gods sake, a 19 year old performing a "karva chauth" for his husband-to-be!!!!!!!!!!!. Gimme a break. The Indian directors do not seem to be free of DDLJ hangover. And please, Karva Chauth is only a North Indian tradition. When will our producers learn, that there is a whole India out there who is culturally very different from Northern India.Women's liberation movement or political correctness is almost unheard of in Bollywood. Just showing heroine wearing skimpy ultramodern clothes, and gyrating in discos does not make them independent. It is the thoughts that count. But hell, who cares ???And the teenagers in the movie always are wealthy sons of their wealthy parents. They study in south Bombay college, drive cars, wear expensive clothes, live in palace-like homes where they have their own separate bedrooms, eat burger-coke-fries, go to discos.And what is the deal with the hero Rajeev? Isn't he mature enough to analyze his own feelings? Why he suddenly abandons the other girls without proper reason? Just because the first girl loves him does not mean that he will find true love only from her. What about the other girl's feelings?The story writers even cannot think new name for the characters. The hero is "Rajeev", heroine is "Payal". Even before 20 years, we had the same name. The characters are of new generation, but can't have new names.But hey, who cares. The producers made money, the actors had their share of fame, the public enjoyed the movie. So who gives a damn about the logic. And in that case, when did logic took a front seat in Bollywood movies" 
" Typical college film","If you like such films then watch it It's not as stupid as KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI though and quite realistic in comparison(at least the friends are shown real) but the story goes for a tossthe characters suddenly change like the friends of Shahid who suddenly become good guys.etc Plus the love angle is damn clich√©d but the handling is goodThe Karvachaut bit looks stupid tooThe film is okay for people who want to remind their college daysKen Ghosh did a good job though the script is faulty Music is goodShahid looks nice and acts well but imitates SRK in many scenes and that got stuck to him for a long time otherwise he is decent in emotional scenes Amrita Rao handled her part very well Shenaz irritatesthe rest are okay" 
" Bollywood at it's best.","This is what you search in bollywood. I believe it's a timeless piece of romantic comedy for teenagers. Those were the years when bollywood had it's own take on film making not like now where they are all copying from other movies." 
" Story, stereotypes, judgments... Same old, same old!!!!!","I still remember the familiarity I felt with this movie when it released because it released during my teen years.
But, years later watching this movie again, I realized:
-They made Payal to be the stereotypical conservative girl who performs a 'karva chauth' at 19 !!!!!!
Alisha to be modern one.So, that makes Alisha an unworthy puppet who's only there to strengthen the lead couple's love story. Simply put, I hate every story of this kind."
