" Horrible","Aftab's career after Mast was downhill, though he got few hits like Kasoor but mostly he signed nonsense films, this was debut of A Muthu(Editor of DD films and many films). The film introduced Zulfi Syed and Yukta Mookhey. The film was delayed due to some problem or another The story is as old as hills, though a few scenes are well handled, but the drama, romance reminds you of old films Lot of hamming, melodrama Direction is bad Music is badAfab Shivdasani tries too hard but looked too kiddish for the role though he does impress at places but otherwise he hams in many scenes Yukta is a non actress, Zulfi Syed is okay Govind Namdeo, Smita Jaykar and rest are okay" 
" a horrible film!","Pyaasa is one of the typically bad Bollywood films I've seen. It marks the debut of the former Miss World and beauty queen Yukta Mookhey. so i was anticipating its release badly. I had a hunch that Yukta's debut wouldn't be too great. because none of the beauty queens' (aishwarya or sushmita's)debut flicks did a remarkable business at the box office. Upon its release, I was proved right.The story is too typical with a love triangle combined with a revenge plot. Suraj (Aftab Shivdasani) dreams of becoming a rich guy some day. With the arrival of a multi millionaire businesswoman sheetal (yukta) his dreams turn into reality. Suraj also falls in love with her. but she always rejects his advances. why? we get to know later. actually, sheetal's father was cheated by one of his employees and is usurped of his business and property. to take revenge, sheetal employs suraj as a weapon to subdue her enemies. but she falls in love with the employees's son prem (zulfi syed, a wooden actor ever) and suraj is left heart-broken. what happens next is nothing worth writing about.Yukta fails on all accounts. she can't emote through her eyes and she must do something about her diction. she is pretty (that's obvious because she was a beauty queen) but that's not enough to become a successful actress. Aftab is horrible as usual. he is an actor who doesn't have a definite style to his acting. and the result is always lousy acting and hamming. Zulfi syed is one of the worst debutante to have been around bollywood. he cannot emote and the less said about him the better.the music was pretty decent. 'milti hai jhukti hai' was the best track in the film. the rest were passable.avoid!!!!!"
