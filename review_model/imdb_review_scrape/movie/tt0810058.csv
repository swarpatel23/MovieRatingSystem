" Disaster..worst movie of 2006","Aap Ki Khatir is a blatant copy of many Hollywood Movies like Wedding Date, French Kiss and Bridget Jones. The only problem is half the time Bollywood Movies manage to entertain the audience even if it has copied a Hollywood Movie. Aap Ki Khatir is a Dull, Boring and practically a pathetic movie. There are only 2 good things about this film. One is obviously the music which is not great, but decent. The Second are the 2 actresses Amisha Patel who usually makes crap movies, but her sexy image keeps you still watching her. Priyanka Chopra looks quite pretty, but her acting seems to get weaker, perhaps she needs to focus on what movies to choose. Akshay Khanna is alright i guess. Dino is unusual, unrealistic and is suppose to be smart/rich, Yeah right. Sunil shetty tries to be funny but bores. The family members are suppose to be modern and all actors try to be funny. The family drama and members is described in one word awful." 
" Copy Copy & Copy","One wonders if this is the same Director/ Darmesh Darshan who made films like "Raja Hindustani" & "Dhadkan".A clich√©d theme with scenes copied from Hollywood movies like "French Kiss", "Bridget Jones Diaries", "The Wedding Date" to name a few.Akshay Khanna is good as usual, while Priyanka Chopra needs a complete makeover with her clothes, make up, acting...she needs lots of improvements. Suniel Shetty should quit movies, he spoils the film even more by trying to be funny. The less said about the others the better.The movie has some melodious tunes by the latest sensation in the Hindi music world Himesh Reshamiya. One wonders what's the purpose of using words like "bullocks" & "get a life dude" in the songs, negative words that spoil music!A large number of Bollywood directors seem to be in desperate need to attend creativity courses.Just think people instead of trying to take your audience for a ride." 
" Horrible","Dharmesh Darshan after melodramatic messes like BEWAFAA returns with AAP KE KHATIR a remake of A WEDDING DATEThe film also reminds of PYAAR TO HONA HI THA(FRENCH KISS remake) which was tad betterThis film tries hard to look like a modern love story but falls flat The first half focuses on comedy scenes which are too in your face, the scenes between Akshaye and Priyanka too are awful especially their sudden love angleThe director suddenly forces the drama in second half and Punjabi stuff which is bad and the sudden Dino-Amisha angle is forcedDirection is bad Music is saving graceAkshaye Khanna looks bored and though better then the rest yet he got typecast in such roles Priyanka overacts badly initially but is good towards the end Dino is okay, Suneil is horrible Amisha is bad Anupam and Lilette irritate and so the guju family" 
" Indian woman hires man to be her boyfriend at her sister's wedding in the UK.","Anu is going from India to step-sister Shirani's wedding in London. In order to regain the appreciation of her ex-boyfriend Danny, she hires Aman to act as her date, just for the wedding. Arjun (Anu's step-father) gives Aman quite a grilling about how they met, when they met, how they got to know each other. I wonder how deeply the cover story was worked out. Of course, many secrets will be revealed if this is anything like The Wedding Date.Anu and cousin Nikki quiz Shirani about Kunal, her finance. There are introductions all around. Danny, the wolf in the fold, arrives late, but is an important piece in the web of inter-relationships. Arjun bristles immediately at Danny's presence, and wants to throw him out. This would have been more peaceful, but less truthful. Since Danny is Kunal's old friend, Betty insists that he stay and be welcomed. There are 3 days until the wedding.Fun with cricket; Anu blackmails Aman in to letting Danny have a good time, but Aman won't have it. Odd stuff, but helps Danny and Aman get to respect each other. That evening at a dance party, Aman sings and dances with Nikki and other women at the party. Danny gets a bit jealous, and Shirani gets closer to telling Anu about Shirani and Danny. Anu becomes more impressed with Aman. Anu gets drunk, and things proceed between her and Aman, but not too far. The next morning, Aman details new charges for services rendered, though no intimate activities.On the second full day, things start out frosty between Aman and Anu, but warm up later. Kunal's family shows up. They are culturally more than a little bit different than Shirani's family. Comedy ensues. Arjun and Aman play chess, though it might as well have been fencing. The women play cards and discuss all the relationships. Plus there is an outdoor cookout. Anu's friend Maya calls; Arjun picks up, and hears just enough from Maya to guess that something is fishy between Anu and Aman. Arjun probes; Aman feints (well, lies). Things keep getting more complicated, but people are getting cornered into telling the truth. Danny tries to get back with Shirani; she will have none of it. Aman walks in unintentionally, but grasps everything immediately. Shirani and Aman talk, while Danny tries to sweet talk Anu. Arjun and Aman finish up the day at a campfire, drinking and talking.On the third day, the full wedding party has a large meal together outside in the cold. This was followed by a musical number. Danny and Anu attempt to finish their talk afterward. Ah,dark truths. Anu admits her relationship with Aman was fake, while Danny admits he had a relationship with Shirani, after Anu left the UK for India. He came to the wedding for Shirani, and that's not working out. Neither of them is happy. Anu is even less happy when she finds that Nikki and even Aman knew about this before she did. Anu takes it out on Aman, since she cannot take it out on anyone else. Oi. She demands that he leave, and he sets about to do this. In the evening, he's leaving with his suitcase. Kunal begs him to stay, and gives him the key to his cottage. Anu urges Shirani to tell Kunal the truth; Shirani and Betty counter with 'later is better.'The morning of the wedding, there is a lot of jovial camaraderie. Aman shows up, not dressed up, still prepared to leave. He appeals to Anu to reconsider her 'get lost' imperative. He says good-bye to Betty, who still rather likes him. Arjun tips the balance; Anu goes to the cottage to stop Aman. She finds the money she paid Aman instead of Aman. Shirani decides to tell Kunal, who is furious at Danny. Aman talks Kunal off the ledge. Kunal talks Aman into returning.Perhaps this will work out?-----Scores-----Cinematography: 8/10 Good, except perhaps for the blatant lip-syncing. Still, I liked the quality of the singing/dancing numbers.Sound: 9/10 Also good.Acting: 6/10 What a mixed bag. I thought Amisha Patel (Shirani), Akshaye Khanna (Aman), Anupam Khar (Arjun), and Lilleth Dubey (Betty) were quite good. On the other hand, Sunil Shetty (Kunal), Dino Morea (Danny), and Priyanka Chopra (Anu) were uneven.Screenplay: 8/10 The writing reminded me a lot of The Wedding Date, but with significant differences, of course. Still, the story moved along well, and the exposition of motivation was fine. The mental fencing between Aman and Arjun was quite nice." 
" ** Great Overall Movie, With Comedy ALL Round **","Hi..For The Wedding Date Knock Off The Cast Did Brilliantly, Beautiful & Scenery, Light Hearted Comedy At Its Best, Recommended.2 Thumbs For Akshay Khanna, Priyanka & Amisha Looked Gorgeous Throughout The Movie.Anything With Anupum Kher Is A Must See Movie. Not A Waste Of Money Or Time Good Entertainment. The Overall Movie Has A Start, Middle & End, Which Is Well Put Together.AAP KI KHATIR Keep Rocking Bollywood.. A Good Movie With The Family. Great Cast The All Suited They Rolls Perfectly.The Best Scene In Movie I Think When The Guju's Meet The Punjabi's. Well Put Together, Also The Mobile Scence Where Anu Talks About His RINGTONE'S Was Hilarious..Enjoy Over & Out Recommended Overall 9/10 Watch This Over KHABI ALVIDA NA KEHNA.." 
" Disappointment","I was initially attracted to the movie from my ongoing affair with Priyanka Chopra, however, this was not her best performance and looked out of sorts in the role. Currently, her roles seem to favor that one dimensional role of innocent, yet intelligent, independent woman (see Barsaat). The movie overall lacked a sufficient/believable storyline to draw the viewer. The lead actor was sufficient with his limited role however, not enough was done to build up to the climax or even build up the relationships between the actresses. Seemed to be made on a lower budget in comparison to other titles. I believe for Priyanka's sake she should be a little more selective of her roles and or directors in this case as she was not used up to her potential." 
" Great movie","This movie was so entertaining but it's really enjoyable at one point In my opinion it's definitely not a failure it's really impressive Akshaye Khanna was brilliant Priyanka was brilliant Sunil is fine amisha is good Dino is decent as the handsome hero Songs are outstanding I loved the title song and other songs Overall 7/10" 
" Not bad","I dunno where to start.Yes a typical bollywood film with the guy getting the girl and all ending happily but nonetheless it was fun, heart warming and some bits were even funny.Musics not all that apart from the title track plus the remix of it, 'afsana' and 'Meethi Meethi Batan' Had a nice little twist to it which usually is predictable but in this film it wasn't so top marks for that.Call me old fashioned if you may but i found Anu's parents a bit too modern and this is coming from an 18 year old born and bred British girl!!! I hate Bollywood so me liking this film means it must be worth seeing!!" 
" A MISERABLE copy of a decent movie.","So, we had Debra Messing and Dermont Mulroney a short while ago in a decent little romantic comedy called the wedding date, which was just above average content and humor wise, and brought up to decent by great acting by all the actors as well as the fantastic atmosphere set up by the film's location and- You must be wondering why I'm giving the review of a Hollywood movie in a bollywood forum.It's simple. Aap Ki Khattir is an EXACT copy of the Wedding date. The honest truth? The movie is terrible. I cannot believe that this is the same director who made Raja Hindustani. The atmosphere, the scene direction is mediocre and deplorable and the dialogue (FIRE that script writer Immediately) is even worse! When you have Lillette Dubey, Akshaye Khanna and Anupam Kher in a movie, you expect quality acting, and that you do get. But only from the three aforementioned actors. Amisha Patel needs to quit the movies. Priyanka Chopra and Suniel Shetty SERIOUSLY overact their respective roles.All in all, a complete flop. Please don't kill your intellect watching this sad mess of a movie." 
" Patience Testing","This one is a Clear remake of 'THE WEDDING DATE' of 2005 starring Debra Messing and Dermot Malroney.Cut back then to UK Where Arjun Khanna(Anupam Khanna)is a very lavish man and has 2 daughters Shirani(Amisha Patel)and Anu (Priyanka Chopra).Anu being his Step-Daughter.Anu hires Aman(Akshaye Khanna)from Lokhandwala to envy her boyfriend Danny(Dino Morea)who doesn't love her.Then after several Twists and turns is the 'All-Happy'ending which is a characteristic of Indian Cinema.Also among the Cast are Sunil Shetty being shirani's boyfriend and Lillete Dubey in the role of Anu's Mother.Of the Cast,Priyanka Chopra is Passable.Amisha Patel needs to learn the ABC of acting after such disastrous Performance in recent Films including this one.Sunil Shetty doesn't have much role to play but couldn't do that also which is a Pity.Anupam Kher is Sincere and so is Lillete Dubey.Of the rest less said the better.But Undoubtedly this Film Belongs to Akshaye Khanna.Inspite of giving a heartfelt performance he also cant save this Picture from being a disaster.He Proves his Worth Every Now and Then.So Be Prepared for the after effects of 'Aap Ki Khatir'."
