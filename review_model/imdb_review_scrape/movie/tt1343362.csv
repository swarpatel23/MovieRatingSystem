" A disappointment....","Expectations from a David-Dhawan-Govinda film are huge, as they have given us true classics in the past. Their latest offering 'Do Knot Disturb' is easily their weakest fare together.There is no script at all, yet the first hr somehow entertains. But the second hr, is boring, irritating & REALLY loud. It becomes a complete mess.Acting is no better either; Govinda, Lara Dutta & Sushmita Sen ham. Govinda's female voice imitation is another sore point. Lara & Sushmita overact like never before. Ritesh is alright. Sohail Khan doesn't work. Manoj Phawa & Rajpal Yadav are fantastic; these 2 steal the show. Ranvir Shorey is wasted; plus the role of his twin is horrible. Himani Shivpuri, Satish Kaushik, Rituparna & Ali Asgar are average.On the whole, don't disturb these people... and not even yourself!" 
" Please, Do (K)not Disturb","Do Knot Disturb sees the return of David Dhawan's favorite story, the infidelity story. This coincides with the return of his favorite actor, Govinda. So, is it worth disturbing the theaters for? Govinda plays a man who cheats on his wealthy wife (Sushmita Sen) with a hot model (Lara Dutta). Unfortunately for him, his wife finds out and sets her childhood friend (Ranvir Shorey) to gather evidence against him. Now, Ranvir has had a crush since childhood on Sushmita, so decides to go the full hog to get any evidence. Govinda decides to put his wife's suspicions to rest, so he hires a waiter (Ritesh Deshmukh) to act as Lara's boyfriend. But Lara also has a real boyfriend (Sohail Khan) who suffers from anger pangs. What follows is the mayhem of Do Knot Disturb.Now, Dhawan is surely a believer in chaos theory. But he needs to understand that there are limits to the amount of chaos someone can fit into a scenario. DKD descends into a farcical situation where the chaos is not funny, it's just chaos. Also, is a slap comedy? Given the situation, yes. Are 2? Suppose so. DKD, unfortunately, has a plethora of slaps. Everyone seems to be slapping everyone, and it's not funny. 50 slaps is not comedy, it's a slap fest. Poor work by the writers. Let's bear in mind here that Dhawan is working with a sub-par script. That makes me feel sympathetic for him to some extent. He tries his best to make this ensemble rise above the script, but fails; hampered by the shoddy work done before him.Govinda tries hard and succeeds to some extent. But playing the man with the roving eye in David Dhawan's movies has been his main role throughout his career. He looks a little overweight in some parts of the movie, though. Riteish Deshmukh does a good job. He stands tall in front of Govinda, and even steals the show from him in some scenes. He is the best performer in the movie.Sushmita Sen should have picked another movie for her comeback. She has a miniscule role with nothing to do. Lara Dutta looks glamorous, but has little else to do. Sohail Khan is good in a small appearance, but could have done better in a meatier role. Ranvir Shorey shouldn't be in this movie. And all the 'John Matthews' jig, only increases the runtime by 20 minutes, while adding nothing, including laughs.The songs are the regular David Dhawan fare, with only Neeraj Shridhar's 'Bebo' being hummable. The sets are good, and look realistic. In fact, they seem the only realistic thing about this movie.Final Verdict: After having ranted so much, you must have guessed my final verdict. Please, give it a miss." 
" Too late","in the 90's after AANKHEN Govinda and DD were a team to reckon with and every year since 1993 to 1999 there was at least 1 hit by the director- actor duo every year in 1994- RAJA BABU, 1995- COOLIE NO.1, 1996- SCS, 1997- HERO NO.1, DEEWANA MASTANA, 1998- BMCM, 1999- HASEENA MAAN JAYEGI After that in 2000 they had KUNWARA which flopped, in 2001 they had 1 hit JODI NO.1 and then a flop KYO KII MAIN JHUTH NAHIN BOLTA in 2003 EK AUR EK GYARAH was an average and then the jodi came back with PARTNER(2007)Coming to DO KNOT DISTURB it brought great expectations because it was the comeback of Govinda- DD and Vashu Bhagnani after BMCM The promos took off but i came to the conclusion directly that this is outdated Now after watching the film I came to know I was so right The story itself of having a girlfriend outside marriage is done to death, first David did it in SAAJAN CHALE SASURAL(1996) and then again in a flop GHARWALI BAHARWALI(1998) and then again in BIWI NO.1(1999) and even in KYO KII MAIN JHUTH NAHIN BOLTA(which had Sushmita in the same wife role) and in NO ENTRY(2005) by Anees BazmeeIn short, that is boring now even the dialogues like Lara saying tumhein bungla chahiye ya flat is done to deathThere added a 4th triangle here with Ritiesh but sadly the film is too loud and too slapstick and the other character Sohail Khan irritates and the film turns into a JAANE BHI DO YAARON type but fails and by the time the end it's too muchDirection by DD is bad Music is ordinaryAmongst actors Ritiesh is become a big force as a comedian and he steals the show from Govinda which is a big thing Govinda is too loud and overboard and though he has his moments, it pales front of his earlier performances even PARTNER Sushmita and Lara are ordinary Sohail does what he does always, screams and makes faces And Ranveer Shorey i don't know what he found in this film?" 
" Desperately tries hard to make you laugh.","In the past decades David Dhawan has successfully given us highly enjoyable movies on the subject of extra marital affairs such as "Biwi No.1", "Gharwali Baharwali" and "Sajan Chale Sasural". But his current "Do Knot Disturb", lacks the famous David-Govinda punch and fails to provide the expected entertainment factor to the viewers. Though the movie does manage to make you laugh in some particular scenes but the number of those hilarious moments is too small for a David-Govinda comic venture.The start is pretty fast and well executed by David where he at once reveals the main plot of the drama about Govinda having an affair with an item girl Dolly, played by Lara Dutta. Sushmita Sen, as Govinda's wife, suspects her husband and uses her old time friend, Ranvir Shorey to be a detective investigating Govinda's movements. It all starts with a photograph in which Govinda can be seen standing along Lara. Incidentally, Ritesh Deshmukh also gets clicked in that photograph as he was passing by. To safeguard his position Govinda bribes Ritesh Deshmukh to play the role of Lara's dummy boy friend and make fool of the detective hired by Sushmita Sen. To overcrowd the screen, there is another added character of Lara's old boyfriend, played by Sohail Khan in his same old comic style seen many times before.The two line plot is known to the viewer in the first 20 minutes itself and then it's all about the characters chasing each other and trying hard to make you laugh with their so called hilarious acts and one liners. At times, a good laughter is there, but in major part of the movie, you just keep on waiting to see the famous David-Govinda magic, once again on the screen. Sadly in "Do Knot Disturb" their chemistry does not work because of very few genuine & well written comic scenes in the script. Too much stress has been given on the dialogue delivery and tone of speech of the characters, which eventually fails to generate any positive impact. Even Govinda's highly promoted act of "Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly" has also been used in a very unimpressive manner, which doesn't stay in the viewers mind.In the second half, David also uses the cult "Dead Body Act" from "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron", which again falls flat along with other half baked jokes played for the viewers. The silly chase sequence between various characters towards the end simply loses its track and results in quite a messy climax unexpected from a David Dhawan movie. On top of it, the last scene of the movie even makes you recheck the team behind this below average attempt accompanied by such a talented star-cast and a big production house.In the acting department, Govinda as usual tries his best to make you laugh, but its Ritesh Deshmukh who scores the maximum, doing a highly competent act with the veteran. However, it's a fact that there is nobody in the Industry who could have handled the "Dolly Dolly" act with such a conviction and grace, other than Govinda himself. Sushmita Sen looks pretty but has also put on lots of weight which shows on her face. Lara Dutta on the other hand looks hot and refreshing. In fact the two movies in which she has looked hotter than ever are "Partner" and "Do Knot Disturb" (may be in "Blue" too). Manoj Pahwa and Rajpal Yadav excel in their supporting comic characters, but Ranvir Shorey and Sohail Khan are completely wasted. Anybody could have done their roles, especially the part of Ranvir, which was not written according to the immense comic timing & talent he has got. What was the use of his double role scene in the climax still remains a mystery. And I hardly understand why Rituparna Sengupta accepted such a tiny and unimportant role in the movie.Musically it is a winner with 3 highly entertaining songs where the best one is, "Meri Bebo". Nadeem Shravan once again prove themselves as they come up with a very interesting number "Zulfein Khol Khaal Ke" which is a rehashed version of "Leke Pehla Pehla Pyar". The songs as well as the movie, is shot lavishly in beautiful locations including the posh interiors of a luxurious hotel.To be precise, in "Do Knot Disturb" both David Dhawan and Govinda are not in their full forms, desperately trying hard to make you laugh and have a good time. But the end result is far below than what was being expected from the talented duo.(The film is also highly inspired from a French movie, "La Doublure" or "The Valet" released in 2006.)" 
" Do Knot Watch:: Comedy past sell by date","The entire unit should be made to stand in line for not doing a reality check on David Dhawan that the basic premise of "Do Knot Disturb" resembles "Golmaal Returns". In order to ward off suspecting wife, the husband hires a guy who is supposed to pretend the other woman's lover thereby setting off a chain of hilarious events.I am surprised how established names like Sushmita Sen, Lara Dutta, Ritesh Deshmukh, Ranvir Shorey have decided to be a part of the project. Even Rituparna Sengupta - oh no! Sohail Khan is getting type-casted into the slot of Manoj Pahwa & Rajpal Yadav. He better watch out (restraint is the keyword!).David's pairing with Govinda has always resulted in comedy that can be termed, if I dare say "cheap". The formula did work in some part of history but surely not any more. And needless to say Govinda gets unleashed and goes Over-the-top to the point of irritation.Strictly not advised even for hard-core Govinda fans!" 
" Copy of a Hungarian Movie","As a Hungarian, I was very pleased to see that for once Bollywood is not copying a Hollywood hit, but a little known but very funny Hungarian one!!! What a surprise. And indeed, it is virtually a carbon copy of 'A miniszter félrelép' but with added Bollywood songs, extra unnecessary scripting, chaotic direction, etc. Do Knot Disturb actually manages to ruin the funniness of an otherwise great story.The reviews of Do Knot Disturb are deservedly negative, however to quote just one reviewer of 'A miniszter félrelép' "it's the best comedy i have seen in a decade. Charming slapstick, shades of Chaplin, witty dialogue and hilarious twists and turns." So people if you went to see Do Knot Disturb with these expectations but came away disappointed, please find yourself a subtitled copy of 'A miniszter félrelép' and you will be endlessly entertained." 
" Pathetic movie. Do not waste your time and money!.","Worst comedy movie ever. Very irritating attempts to do comedy. Govinda must retire gracefully than doing such pathetic films. His way of saying "Dolly dolly dolly dolly dolly" simply tests your tolerance in this movie. Story sucks. Looks like entire movie was shot in one take. David Dhawan just asked all actors to do their best and went home. Govinda changes his voice pitch without any reason in the movie and thinks this will be funny. In the movie, only the actors seemed to be laughing. The theater was quiet like they were watching some drama movie. Worst dialogues. Worst acting. Worst direction. Overall: worst comedy movie ever." 
" Do Knot Disturb,a complete disaster!","Do Knot Disturb directed by David Dhawan tries hard to make you laugh but it fails,big time! The movie is offensive,cheap and loud.There a few scenes which manages to bring laugh but they are far and between.The story is a big yawn The direction is disastrous.The music is average.The dialogs are bad.Performances:- Govinda,Sushmita Sen and Lara Dutta stink.Ritesh Deshmukh,may be a little loud at times but is good.Rajpal Yadav and Manoj Pahwa are the scene stealer.Rajpal Yadav is loud but still manages to impress you with his performance and Manoj Pahwa is damn superb.Ranvir Shorey,Sohail Khan and Rituparna Sen are wasted.Do knot Disturb is a huge failure" 
" Doli Doli - Laughter Through and Through.","Having seen just some of the promos of this comedy, it was not a let down and especially if it is directed by David Dhawan and the cast includes Govinda and Riteish Deshmukh. A rich businessman tries to hide his extramarital affairs by hiring a simple man whose mother is sick and in hospital.Starring Govinda, Lara Dutta, Sushmita Sen, Riteish Deshmukh, Manoj Pahwa, Ranvir Shorey, Rajpal Yadav, Sohail Khan and Himani Shivpuri, the movie is directed by David Dhawan and is produced by Vashu Bhagnani.Govinda is his usual – good at comedy, while the same cannot be said for Sushmita Sen but it can be for Lara Dutta while Riteish Deshmukh, Manoj Pahwa and Rajpal Yadav, just excel in their roles and almost steal the whole show. Sohail Khan and Ranvie Shorey are not bad either and Himani Shivpuri is also good as she always is. One song that is worth listening to is "Bebo." Once again, David Dhawan has teamed up with Govinda and gone on to create a movie that can only be described "laughter through and through" and this time he added Riteish Deshmukh, Manoj Pahwa and Rajpal Yadav with it and with this combination, he has managed to create a real laughter.A good dose comedy of errors is what one needs to relax and watch." 
" This is a very bad movie","A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away, Govinda and David Dhawan were a formidable actor-director team who you could count on to deliver a few good laughs. Much time has passed since, but the duo is still flogging the same formulas over and over again. Their latest collaboration, Do Knot Disturb is a flat-out rip-off of the French comedy, The Valet, but if you didn't know that you'd say it's a rejig of their own previous films, Saajan Chale Sasural and Kyonkii Main Jhooth Nahin Bolta, with a generous helping of the director's Biwi No 1 thrown in for good measure. Govinda stars as the cheating husband of a suspicious millionaire wife Sushmita Sen who hires private-eye Ranvir Shorey to follow her husband's every move when she chances upon a photograph of her spouse with sexy item-girl Lara Dutta. To hide his affair from his wife, Govinda tracks down Ritesh Deshmukh, a waiter who can also be spotted in the picture, and pays him to pretend that the siren is in fact, his girlfriend. The wife is not fooled; she plays the situation for what it's worth, making her husband jealous of his mistress' new living arrangement with the waiter. It all ends in an agonizingly harebrained climax at a five-star hotel where much chaos ensues when husband, wife, mistress, her ex-boyfriend, detective and waiter, all show up and run into each other. Its humour derived from such staple David Dhawan clichés as mistaken identities and misunderstandings, Do Knot Disturb is a repellant comedy with irrational plot-points and flaccid punch-lines. The jokes are stale; most of them involve slapstick gags like a corpse getting stuck in a laundry chute, and a possessive ex-boyfriend who goes around punching everyone in sight. Hanging off a wafer-thin premise that barely holds, this film is repetitive and boring, and doesn't even give its actors much scope to push their comic boundaries. The once dependable Govinda is reduced to a mere caricature of his earlier self, his performance now amounting to a variety of facial contortions, and silly dialogues yelled out at the top of his voice. Ritesh Deshmukh and Ranvir Shorey are wasted in thankless roles, and Lara Dutta spends most of the film batting her eyelashes and speaking in a squeaky voice.The film's one major eyesore is the usually elegant Sushmita Sen whose unflattering wardrobe does nothing to hide her sudden weight-gain. As the doubting wife determined to catch her philandering husband, Sushmita ought to have considered sitting on Govinda, and more than likely he'd have confessed his infidelity in the first ten minutes of this film itself, thus sparing us the torture of watching the rest of this drivel.Vulgar, loud and entirely pointless, Do Knot Disturb has virtually nothing to offer anyone with even half a brain. At best, Rajpal Yadav scores a few chuckles with his manic physical comedy. It's hard to believe this film was actually directed by someone. Was David Dhawan ever on the set at all? Perhaps Sushmita Sen ate him! That answers two important questions." 
" Very Juvenile.","Govinda plays a man who is married to a former Miss Universe(played by Sushmita Sen) while he's having an affair another former Miss Universe (Played by Lara Dutta). If you believe this storyline, well I've got a bridge I'd like to sell ya. Ritesh Deshmukh, Rajpal Yadav, Ranvir Shorey and Sohail Khan co-star.This film manages to bring out the worst in everybody's acting. Sushmita Sen was dressed to accommodate her recent weight gain but she looked beautiful as ever and I liked the styling but she was horribly wasted in her role." 
" First HALF excellent.. second half is the main culprit..","i can assure u a hundred percent entertainment in first half but in second half it was a mess. and according to me the main culprit of the movie. but for fun and enjoyment u can give it a chance.The songs in the movie are fillers. as usual in David dhawan movies.. two songs are excellent 'Bebo' and 'Mere Naal'. rest were OK. script was not up to the mark. second half was too loud. Govinda was good so was rite-sh deshmukh. ran veer Sherie and raj pal were great. Lara was sexy . whole plot is conceived at two places 1. home 2. hotel cinematography had no scope. songs caricaturisation was OK. Nadeen shravan's comeback was not so great. no magic of their works here. except of two numbers. direction was OK so overall i rate it as average fare." 
" Forget Knot, Do Not Watch This","'Do Knot Disturb' is one of the worst movie I've seen recently. David Dhawan has a reputation of ripping off other films and his movies look overtly glossy, colourful and very tacky. 'Do Knot Disturb' is no different at all. I suppose Bollywood has run out of Hollywood movies to copy so now they have started copying French movies. 'Do Knot Disturb' rips off 'La Doublure'. 'La Doublure' itself was by no means a great movie but it looked classy and made me laugh at times. 'Do Knot Disturb' can only be compared to a cheap knockoffs that nobody wants to buy. It's cringeworthy from start to finish. However, since I heard that it starred Sushmita Sen and Rituparna Sengupta, I thought there might be something to look forward to. I wasn't aware of the rest of the cast. Sengupta is wasted in a miniscule role and Sen, what was she thinking when she signed on for this? Govinda and Ranvir Shorey are at their worst. I've never thought of Deshmukh as a great actor but here he achieves a new level of crappiness. Sohail Khan is among the worst actor ever and he's never even done a passable movie let alone good. I should have checked out the cast list beforehand, then I would have avoided this."
