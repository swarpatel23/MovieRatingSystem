" Cable Channel Choice","I subscribe to Bollywood movies through my local cable channel. In exchange for giving us at least one new release every month, they bombard us with repeats and really, really bad movies like this one. It appears to be written by an ADHD teen girl while texting with a friend. It also appears to be filmed by the same teen girl, with a 20 year old camcorder. The script was awful, the plot was awful, the continuity was awful, the acting horrific, the songs disastrous, and the background music was really, really bad. Thankfully, it was short. I'm just waiting to see if anyone else falls into the cable trap and watches this one too. Usually the movies that have less than 5 votes suddenly get noticed when they're aired. There was just way too much randomness and direction switching for one film to be enjoyable."
