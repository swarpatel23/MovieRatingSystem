" Another routine love story, using the same old Punjabi marriage theme to launch the new faces.","If a director gets the job of introducing a young couple in a Hindi film who probably might be the silent producers of the project too, then the easiest (and a readymade) plot to be adapted now a days has to be a romantic comedy made around a big Punjabi wedding situated in Delhi. So following the same formula, RABBA MAIN KYA KAROON is a light comic, family drama revolving around the marriage of debutants Akash Chopra and Tahira, also featuring Arshad Warsi and Paresh Rawal in key roles to make it a major frontline project in the market.Focusing on a young boy being trained in all the wrong things before his love marriage (by the elder brother Arshad), RMKK has nothing substantial or exciting as far as the storyline or content is concerned. Its fresh cast takes care of the youth factor in the film and the comedy part is assigned to the three uncles (Maamas) namely, Paresh Rawal, Tinnu Anand and Shakti Kapoor, who happen to be sex maniacs cheating their own respective wives since many years. The film constantly talks about a mantra followed by these four grown up men religiously (including Arshad) i.e. "To have a happy married life, one must cheat his wife". The writers try to entertain the viewer with sequences based on these hidden betrayals only. And then as usual it all ends on a positive social note wherein the four accept their silly mistakes made and the young boy has his priorities pretty clear for the new life ahead.Presented as a laugh riot written with a questionable theme, RMKK doesn't have much to make you smile or give a good time in the theater. The execution goes over the top in few scenes and the rest go on talking about the same things in a monotonous way. The film has more of Arshad and less of Paresh which might disappoint many friends only interested in watching them together. The Punjabi wedding celebrations give you the same, seen before sort of a feeling and the characters do not convince you much with their routine kind of acts delivered uninterestingly. Moreover the film has a script which strongly tries to project all men as born dogs, always hungry for sex and all women as the dumb, easy to fool companions who know nothing about their husbands at all. And I did find this kind of projection quite objectionable, crossing the boundaries of decency in its many sequences.The soundtrack has one catchy song with some weird lyrics saying, "Tu Khulla Saand Ban Ja" which easily shows the desperation to get noticed in its obscene words. The background score and camera-work is strictly OK and the project more or less becomes bearable only due to the few known names in it, brightly showcasing their proved talent in the given scenes at regular intervals.So we have Arshad Warsi with his famous comic timing and Paresh Rawal who can make you laugh even when he is not smiling or rendering any hilarious lines in his few scenes. The debutants Akash and Tahira perform satisfactorily and their acts were much more than what I was expecting. Shakti Kapoor tries too hard and Tinnu Anandis just OK. Enacting their wives, Riya Sen, Himani Shivpuri and Anuradha Patel play it fine but Raj Babbar remains the same as seen in many previous films.In all, yes a love story has always been the safest bet to introduce a new young couple in a Hindi film since ages. But now its really time, that the young ones plan something novel, unconventional and experimental as their first movie to showcase their raw talent. The gamble has surely got more probabilities to go wrong but still its better to get introduced in a film which has something new to offer and is not just another routine, old wine in a new bottle kind of stuff inspired from many previous hits.Sadly, RABBA MAIN KYA KAROON falls in the category of the above mentioned mediocre projects only which try to en-cash the few big names in their star-cast just in vain. It's a kind of film which you might feel OK watching on a DVD or a channel, but buying a costly multiplex ticket for it, spending your precious time & effort, simply needs to be avoided." 
" A Likable Rom-Com!","'Rabba Main Kya Karoon' is A Likable Rom-Com, that surprises its viewer. Its funny & entertaining at most parts, although monotony is its biggest downer. 'Rabba Main Kya Karoon' Synopsis: A few days before his marriage, a bachelor gets influenced by his older brother to do all the wrong things. 'Rabba Main Kya Karoon' begins well & the comedic moments work nicely. Its the second-hour that disheartens. The sequences get repetitive & even the humor seems forced. In short, a better second-hour was needed. The Screenplay has merits, but lacks innovation in the second-hour. Amrit Sagar Chopra's Direction is decent. Cinematography is fine. Editing is well-done.Performance-Wise: Arshad Warsi is top-notch. His impeccable comic-timing & self-confidence make him the scene-stealer here. Akash Chopra is alright. Tahira Kocchar has the potential to become a fine performer. Riya Sen is adequate. Paresh Rawal, Tinnu Anand, Rakesh Bedi & Shakti Kapoor contribute wonderfully. Raj Babbar is good. Himani Shivpuri is as usual.On the whole, 'Rabba Main Kya Karoon' is a decent watch." 
" Rabba Main Kya Karoon is an entertainer","It is a light family comedy which makes you smile. It is a must watch movie for all married couples. Arshad Warsi has done a great job in this movie.The new actors look great. Paresh Rawal & Shakti Kapoor also add to the fun factor. It relaxes you after a tiring day. Go watch this movie with your family to have a good time together.Newcomer Tahira Kochar looks really cute . The song "Khula Saand" is a chart-buster. The music suits the theme of the movie perfectly. The best thing is its a short Hindi movie of 1hr 55min. Anyone who wants to know the secret of getting happy married life by cheating on their wives, must have sneak peak of RABBA MAIN KYA KAROON. When you watch this movie you'll not feel any kind of exaggeration, it is everything that must have happened with you at some point if life." 
" Fun Ride......","RMKK is a fun ride. The movie is enjoyable and also has a good message in it. The theory that "all" men cheat on their wives is interestingly explored through the slimy characters played by Paresh Rawal, who proves his wife, the ever-brilliant Sushmita Mukherjee, clinically unhinged to get away with his womanizing, Shakti Kapoor, who euphemistically describes fornicating as smoking, and Arshad, who fools his gullible wife Riya Sen into believing he is faithful to her.The narrative remains faithful to the theme of unfaithful husbands. There are perky moments in the first-half where the writing outdoes the impending mood of sluggishness that creeps up in the second-half.With a cast that seems to have a blast, Akash makes a comfortable and confident debut. Arshad Warsi's incorrigible 'Bade Bhaiyya' act and his counseling on hormonal freedom are the film's USP.Arshad doles out brotherly advice like Gandhian wisdom, even bringing in a reference to 'Bhagwan Rama' that would have the director's grandfather, the tele-serial Ramayan maker Ramanand Sagar blush.The Story is fully in control of the comic chaos in this big fat eventful shaadi. To Summarize RMKK is an enjoyable movie and I am sure people will have fun. 8/10"
