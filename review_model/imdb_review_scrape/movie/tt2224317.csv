" 'LOOTERA' is poetry on celluloid!","LOOTERA (4/5)Please visit - http://iamalekhya.blogspot.in/'LOOTERA' is poetry on celluloid!This chef-d'oeuvre love story by Vikramaditya Motwane resembles a poetry in beauty and the evocation of feeling, and despite a slight ramble in the second half, it wins you over. Sonakshi Sinha leaves you awestruck with her incredible performance.The film is set in the years 1953-54. Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha) is a young bengali girl, living with her father, a Zamindar, in an aristocratic world. In this placid existence enters an archaeologist, Varun (Ranveer Singh), seeking help from the Zamindar with a letter from the Archaeological Society of India. With his remarkable knowledge of books, music, and expertise in his own field, Varun impresses the Zamindar, sneaking his way into the life of the family, and the heart of Pakhi, as love between them, blossoms. But soon, a shocking revelation shatters their world. Leading them to some unanticipated circumstances.The film is dazzlingly beautiful, recreating the 50s in West Bengal. While the first half depicts the town of Manikpur, the second half takes you to the gorgeous Darjeeling. Each frame is immaculate and the setup literally absorbs you. Then, the screenplay is so engrossing, you just can't stray your attention elsewhere. The conviction with which the director, Vikramaditya Motwane, takes you through this story is simply unbelievable, especially considering the fact that he's just a film old. His deeply moving treatment of this delicious script is awe-inspiring. A part of the film is based on "The Last Leaf", a short story by O. Henry. Not only is it visually enticing, the scenes too are aesthetically shot. Be it the father-daughter discourse, or the innocent budding romance, or soulful lovemaking, or even the gloomy turn of events, each aspect is mesmeric. The melodic music too is pleasing to your senses. The slight blemish that the film exposes is the draggy 40 odd minute amble in the second half. That's the only time it pushes you slightly towards disinterest. But fortunately, it gathers its feet as it approaches the climax, and eventually ends in a high.Performances are the most crucial aspect of such an enterprise. A slip here could ruin the entire effort put in everywhere else. And this is where the film succeeds. Each act is as real as it could have been. Ranveer Singh is surprisingly composed and plays his part perfectly. But it's Sonakshi Sinha who's the real star of the show. She effortlessly portrays the depths of her character and brings out vivid moods with brilliant skill. She indubitably is a revelation. All other actors put up a flawless show.In all, LOOTERA is a masterpiece that delights the senses, excites the intellect and induces emotional admiration. Do not miss it!Rating: 4/5" 
" A Masterpiece in every sense of the word ! :)","Years ago I watched Dev Anand's entertainer -Nau Do Gyaarah (perhaps my only start-to-finish black n white feature) ,the movie had it all:- drama, suspense, comedy, romance, action etc. Motwane's Lootera is one such flick, in the same genure (and no I haven't read the O.Henry book)... ... Prepared with a thick batter of emotions, spruced with romance ,garnished with suspense and drama with a tinge of comedy ,its a mouth watering dish u wont want to miss from Phantom-Balaji house this weekend . Great performances by both the leads (Sonakshi s a voluptuous surprise ;) , Ranveer 's show).. I was initially a bit sceptical with the star cast but both of em have been used pretty well ! Its a period movie with an old world charm to it all the way. Base a movie in Bengal and u already have half of my loyalty...brilliantly captured, mesmerizing cinematography..a beautiful canvas on the celluloid , good narration and a fabulous score by Trivedi are enough treats in store for any movie buff... I am going with a thumping 4.5* outta 5 for Lootera, its one movie that would be talked about for times immemorial and would be etched in the minds of those who are in love, and those who shall be. By the time u leave the cinema hall with moist eyes and the humdrum of the background score in ur head , u know Motwane has aced it yet again , a remarkable flight after another great -Udaan ..P.S.-- If u have loved ur Bodyguards, Singhams , Cocktails ,high on testosterone - Bhatt factory products, and other Sallu Bhai stuff or are excited about SRK's Eid release..., chances are u would abhor this one, so better not go. Its sad to hear crass about a movie of such a stature" 
" A Bittersweet Romance painted on a Musical Canvas","VjMOVIEW: Highly RecommendedLength: 142 minutes Genre: Romantic Drama Director: Vikramaditya Motwane (VM)Target Audience: Strictly for those who prefer serious and meaningful cinema which has no scope for commercialized treatment Parallels of the Movie: Raincoat, Fanaa(Read more at www.vjmoviews.com)How often have you seen a meticulously detailed artistic movie appealing to a romantic genre. May be, not yet. If you wish to experience such a cinematic gem, welcome abound to the world of Lootera.Lootera sounds like a simple story line. A con-man(Ranveer) imposters himself as an archaeologist to visit the Manikpur village in West Bengal only to plunder away with the ancient wealth of local Zamindar. While doing so, he falls in love with the daughter(Sonakshi) of zamindar. Placing his professional duties above his personal commitments he decides to leave Sonakshi on the day of their engagement never to come back. However, the two meet again a year later under intimidating circumstances only to give way to their undying flame of love. Quite antithetical to their characters in previous movies, the lead cast dons an entirely different roles this time. Sonakshi is no longer our loud mouthed and pelvic thrusting blubbery lady and Ranveer is the poignant soul exercising restraint in all his mannerisms. Amidst all this, the two come out with flying colours in their performances and on- screen chemistry. While, the script and screenplay are penned down with utmost craftiness, it's the Execution which raises the bar. There are myriad emotions downplayed in words but amplified with gestures between Sonakshi and Ranveer. Some scenes worth mentioning are: the painting scene in which Sonakshi teaches the art of painting to Ranveer; the chase sequence between Ranveer and cops. And as Ranveer mouths his bucket list to Sonakshi in one of the scenes, he indeed proves it to us- It was a masterpiece in his career.VM has shown that he is a rare breed of horse who belongs to an altogether different stable of Bollywood. He sure has a penchant for leaving his audience with an optimistic and cheerful face in the climax. And, as for the music, while I write this review, the triumphant background score still resonates in my mind. Kudos to you, Mr. Amit Trivedi. You have proved yet again that you are here to stay. At last, a movie this year which could get a tear roll down my cheeks.. :-)(Read more at www.vjmoviews.com)" 
" The Reason , Why I Love Romantic Movies.............","First of all to begin with i would say that this is romance in its purest of form and Mr. Motwane did it again after his masterpiece Udaan .... form , execution , structure , text , dialogues , score and music works perfectly......... Chemistry between Ranveer and Sonakshi works on various levels and the poetic yet realistic treatment of subject and enigmatic approach towards matter gave the two perfectly written characters... First half is an amazing look into Indian history along with doomed romance which would have given birth to beautiful things but wasn't destined to prosper...... second half is the look into the consequences of the choices and is way too dark and realistic in comparison to the fairy-tale approach of first half........Might be too 'different' for mainstream audiences , but this movie have one thing that most of the movies now a days from Bollywood lacks , Class....if you want to witness sheer romance and meditate silence and feel the warmth and cinema is the medium that does this the best for you..... then Lootera is the thing for you.....Anurag You Are Great!Balaji thanks for backing up this classic timeless piece of workAnd for Mr. Vikramaditya Motwane i would say.... keep Em coming man.....you are the future!" 
" A superlative celluloid painting of love,betrayal & redemption","Love, in its purest and uninhibited form, has attracted many film-makers since time immemorial but somehow the thin line between sensitivity and melodrama gets blurred. "Lootera" is one such attempt which brings out the raw passion in its purest form without being too melodramatic that will go down as a classic in history of Indian cinema.Story wise Lootera is an uncomplicated linear story of a con-man falling for a lady who is the daughter of a big zaminder in Bengal. The movie is about love, betrayal, redemption and falling in love all over again. It is the execution which makes all the difference. Motwane with his craftsmanship transcends this story into a visual imagery which strikes tune with the chord of audience's emotions. Even the social milieu of 1950s Bengal has been projected with dexterity when Zamnidari system was almost dying out & government devising laws to abolish the whole Zamindari rule. The inner turmoil of losing one's autocratic set-up & the luxuries all of a sudden indeed comes as a jolt & that has been depicted precisely. Even zamindar Roychowdhury at one point of time confesses to Varun about how he grew habituated with zamindari system & how difficult it is for him to shed it now. While Barun Chanda (who made his debut with Master Satyajit Ray's Seemabaddha) gave a commendable performance as the failing zamindar & a father of a lovely daughter; Sonakshi Sinha steals the show as vulnerable yet emotionally strong Pakhi who falls for a young archaeologist & then their lives turns upside down. Her expressive eyes conveyed the mature emotions in earthy fashion which helps to connect with the character that is in dilemma in accepting his lover after being betrayed once. It is often believed that good director brings out the best from all actors. I sincerely want to differ with this & wish to believe this lady is indeed talented with the hope of seeing Sonakshi Sinha doing more films like Lootera. Never expect the Dabbang & Rowdy girl to give such a restrained and mature performance. While Pakhi is a delight to watch, Ranveer's portrayal of Varun (real name is unknown till the end) grows on you slowly. The soft spoken guy with his boyish charm is an easy bet to win any woman's heart & Ranveer did a stupendous job in projecting the same. Like Sonakshi, his character also has layers of emotions which he delivers through his facial expressions and voice modulation albeit in a controlled manner. Vikrant Massey as Varun's friend Devdas Mukherjee & Adil Hussain as Inspector Singh complimented the acting of the lead pairs thus elevating the proceedings. Arif Zakaria, Divya Dutta & Dibyendu Bhattacharya shines in small roles.... "Silence" plays a crucial role in this epic love story. In real life we often use silence to convey thousands of emotions. It's true that sometimes silence speaks more than words & that what makes Lootera stand out from other films of this genre.The real heroes of the film are Vikramaditya Motwane & his technical team. After delivering the classic Udaan, Motwane hits the bull's eye with "Lootera". Unlike the dark proceedings of his debut film he chooses one of the most basic emotions called "Love" & merges some thrilling elements to create a brilliant film. O. Henry's short story "The Last Leaf" has been seamlessly merged in the second half which uplifts the sensitive depth of the climax. Shetty's cinematography compliments Motwane's vision thus creating an awesome painting in celluloid. Purulia looked astonishing & the intrigued photography is probably one of the best in recent times. Credit goes to Deepika Kalra for editing the frames effectively. Rarely one witnesses such effective use of Block Shots in any mainstream cinema recently. The detailing in production design & lights needs special mention. Art direction is top notch. There is one particular scene where Varun is suffering from indecision of going ahead with his con job and at the same time expressing his love for Pakhi. As Pakhi enters his room there is a dim light everywhere except Varun's eye which shies away in darkness as if he is not able to confront himself.There are many such master strokes in the film which needs more elaborate discussion. The film starts with an old story of a king whose life is stored inside a pet bird. The symbolism has been aptly used as Pakhi imbibes the story & start searching for that "pet bird" until she finds it in a Leaf. The leaf symbolizes the gradual decaying of Pakhi's health and the same time Varun's unconditional love for Pakhi that completes his life. Motwane & Iyer's screenplay did justice to Henry's short story while genius Kashyap's minimal usage of dialogs evokes the perfect ambiance for a classic setting.Amit Trivedi & Amitabh Bhattacharya combo is always superb and then sealed their credibility with Lootera. One of best music of recent times, the setting actually helped in taking the story forward with the lyrics sometime playing the part of a narrator or giving an insight of protagonist's mind. The picturization of the song "zinda hoon yaar" had blown me away completely.If cinema is one of the greatest medium to tell a story then Motwane knows it better than many of the directors at present whose ideas are contrived. A visual painting, an ode to Love, Lootera is a must must watch for those who are seeking good cinema within mainstream domain. The film obviously wont set BO by fire (neither any of the classics ever did) but will go down in the history as a timeless classic.Udaan & Lootera–Motwane, Sir take a bow!!Other directors should learn to use colors in films like Motwane does that never looks like Plastic. Encore!! Encore!! P.S-AnuragKashyap always supports great films.This time along-with him,thanks to EktaKapoor for believing in Motwane's vision & helping him to paint his canvas so beautifully." 
" Motwane captures "Love" in his canvas of lens & reflects the pure beauty through Silence of its characters..","In Genesis 37:9 the following statement is made: "And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me." Vikramaditya Motwane had stunned the critics with his poignant coming of age story 'Udaan'. He does that yet again in Lootera, justifying the feature length body to the soul of O Henry's petite plot. Loooera is like Van Gogh's "Starry Night" that is Picturesque and poignant at the same time. It takes a simple O Henry story – The Last Leaf, and adapts it to a period setting in Bengal and North East India. Somewhere the short story has decent potential for a short film. But Vikramaditya Motwane is one filmmaker who knows how to extract maximum gratification out of minimalism. It's a work of art - slow, deliberate and introspective. It's one of the best films you'll watch this year. It's a triumph of its director's vision, resulting in a win for the performances of its lead actors.There's a sense of subliminal aesthetic familiarity when "Lootera" opens in the newly partitioned India of 1953. The unhurried ambiance of the olden days, the sureness of the camera's frame, the undiluted subtlety of the narrative – and decisively – the itching gut feel that it's not going to work out well in the end. The story is of an archaeologist Varun (Ranveer Singh) who comes for an excavation expedition on a piece of land that belongs to Pakhi's (Sonakshi Sinha) family. Love blooms over Dev Anand's enchanting songs and painting lessons where the teacher ends up turning into a student. The vintage Chevrolet cars, heritage haveli and fading royalty add to the aura. The chemistry between Sonakshi Sinha and Ranveer Singh is delicate, pristine yet searing.Evidently Pakhi falls for the charming visitor only to face betrayal subsequently. Almost a year later, they chance upon each other and are stranded in a cottage amidst snowfall. Now Pakhi is taken over by mixed emotions towards the man while Varun seeks redemption. The director clearly strikes the right chord with the audience and the sublime and surreal shade that he imparts to the story gives it a fairy-tale touch. The tragic end is quite evident all through yet there is that ray of hope which clings on the last leaf.Lootera uses silence and stillness wonderfully well. In such moments of repose, one can hear footsteps on a hilly pathway or a piece of paper being crumpled, and that is such a rarity in a Hindi film.The two halves of Lootera are distinct chapters: the gold, russet and green of the Bengal landscape gives way to the pale, snowy, hilly heights of north India. Each is captured in muted hues by cinematographer Mahendra Shetty, whose contribution to the overall impact of the work is enormous.Every actor in Lootera, irrespective of the footage he or she gets, makes an unmistakable presence. Coming to Sonakshi Sinha's performance, iIf you know her as the 100-crore girl who shakes and swings at the drop of a hat you're in for a surprise. Her nuanced act tugs at your tear glands. A good compliment to Sonakshi's anchoring performance is Ranveer Singh's underplay. He proves he's an actor to reckon with. And he does so despite having a character in shadow of Sonakshi's Pakhi. Supporting performances by Barun Chanda (playing Sonakshi's Zamindar father), Vikrant Massey (Ranveer's best friend) and Adil Hussain (the tough as nails cop) are all top notch too. Arif Zakaria, Dibyendu Bhattacharya and Shirin Guha make brief appearances but lasting impressions.Lootera celebrates the past, mourns the demise of love, life and things of joy and beauty, but in the end affirms the primacy of the human spirit and the power of art to tide over the blows of fate.Now the big question: why a film like Lootera is not working at the box office? The question is irrelevant. It wouldn't matter, at least from the critical point of view, even if it were to fail to get its point across to an audience captivated on Dabangg, Rowdy Rathore, Son of Sardar and suchlike. This is a "film". Appreciate it without the tags of commercialism (or lack of), or art, or new Bollywood. It's a beautiful poetry which is being recited, you either relive and resonate the spirit or, you don't." 
" Main lead character is something else.","Neither "Pakhi"(Sonakshi) nor "Varun"(Ranveer) are the main character of this film. Now if you think that i am joking then you should watch it. For me the main character of this movie is SILENCE and it is something awkward for a Hindi movie nowadays but that's true. The whole movie is show through silence , eyes , facial expression , visuals, surroundings and last but most important background score. This movie is not going to create the kind of magic that "Udaan" did but its a different genre movie and very real. Now if you love to see a story not by dialogues but through expression then this is something you must watch and for other people just find two n half hour a real silence of their life." 
" Lootera: Beautiful Art..","Lootera is a beautiful art of its own kind. Its light,expressive,warm,kind of romance drawn on a huge canvas. A love tale of two people following a new age period cantata. Roughly based on short story "The Last Leaf" by 'O.Henry'. The movie follows a slow yet powerful romance. The movie has comparatively less dialogues and more of creating an beautiful aura around with its expressions. Vikramaditya Motwane (Udaan Fame) has painted a beautiful canvas to show the world that simplicity is more powerful than anything subject. Sonakshi Sinha as Pakhi is top-notch, she is the heart and soul of the movie. Ranveer singh (Varun) is great, he lacks punch in 1or2 odd scenes but overall an actor to look out for.Very rare comes an art film which handles a potential of standing tall for any commercial cinema.Lootera is an "MASTERPIECE", yes the movie has its flaws to an minimal margin but proves very powerful overall. Amit Trivedi add the perfect tune to make it delightful. Cinematographer Mahendra Shetty is the real hero to captures and portray each and every expression to its perfection.Watch Lootera for sure. Cheers !!!" 
" New age Bollywood: Old days charm","This is my first review in IMDb.I went to this movie without any expectation and because of my wife. I was completely blown away by the class of this movie. Direction, music, cinematography and acting by all the actors were top class.I was not a fan of Ranvir Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha. However after watching this movie, I've changed my mind. I believe this is their best performance.Arif Zakaria, Pakhi's father and Adil Hussain impresses in supporting role.Do not miss this movie. I'll rate this 8.5 out of 10." 
" A moving painting with a big screen as its canvas.",""What is a film all about?" asks Aniket Mazumdar in Rituparna Ghosh's Abohoman . Apratim (his son) replies "Depends. Moments maybe!". It seems that Vikramaditya Motwane has done mastery in creating those moments. He first was an assistant of Sanjay Leela Bhansali for Devdas then did something as a choreographer and also played a part of screenwriter for DevD . Then came his first film Udaan in 2010 for which he had already written the story in 2003 but couldn't make a movie out of it as there were no producers to back him up. According to him that struggle was a blessing in disguise as he got his film released on a large scale which he had not even imagined. Udaan made me spellbound and won many accolades and after its success Vikramaditya with his Lootera proved that it was no fluke. He is a genius in creating moments which defines a movie. Lootera is a movie which shows cinematic brilliance on screen and apparently it brings a smile on your face as it is full of magical moments. It is really hard to describe those in words that is why I am not reciting any of those. Who said that the Romance genre has died in Bollywood. The first half of the movie is freshly written but the second half which was shot in Kashmir is adapted from O'Henry's short story The Last Leaf. Set in 1953-Manikpur it is a story of an ageing zamindaar who is struggling with the new law, which the government forbids everyone to do zamindaari. He loves her daughter Paakhi (Sonakshi Sinha) more than his life. And then comes Varun Srivastava (Ranveer Singh) with his friend as an archaeologist to find some remains of a dead civilization under Paakhi's father's land. It is then the joyride begins with so much detailing which is handled by Vikramaditya very efficiently. Each and every sequence of the movie is like a moving painting and is well shot that it feels so stunning and vivid, be it the Kashmir or the Manikpur part. Packed with powerful performances of Ranveer Singh and Sonakshi Sinha the movie ends up being a treat to watch with its supporting cast also doing a great job. It may well be the career defining performance of both the protagonists. Ranveer and Sonakshi puts their heart in the movie and proves a fact that, Yes they also can act. Lootera also demonstrate a fact that wonders can happen when two geniuses are involved in the same project. The second one being Amit Trivedi. This guy just cannot disappoint you. He is getting better and better with each movie. If the movie is a moving painting then Amit Trivedi's music and background score are canvases of it with Shikaayatein and Manmarziyaan being so infectious. The movie works in every department and it is a very rare movie nowadays where the second half doesn't disappoint you. Yes there are some weak points in the second half but they are a few in numbers or negligible as compared to the good parts. Many of you may want to cry or some of you may get disappointed after watching the climax but it brought a smile on my face as Varun smiled after falling off the tree in the last part of the movie. I just felt love in the air. Love between Paakhi and Varun. The magical climax couldn't have made an impact as it did without the Zinda Hoon Main song. I am going with 4 stars for Lootera. Watch it for two geniuses and two future stars of Bollywood.It certainly is the best movie of the year and much much better than the trash that the industry has produced in the name of a love story. P.S:-Do yourself a favour by not missing Lootera on the big screen. 4/5" 
" Lootera : (Lo)ve (o)f (t)he (era)","If you love someone, saying with words is not necessary, when your eyes and your expressions can say it.. Loved it totally, Feel like watching another time, everything was perfect, eyes, expressions, smiles, weather, locations!!! What a movie!! Its totally different from Motwaane's Udaan, but has the similar gripping power over the audience. One thing i didn't like about it was that it was a bit overstretched.The last leaf concept doesn't look hokey and fits well with the script. The music is awesome and blends perfectly with the situations in the movie. Soulful concoction of sensitivity and sensuality without a bit of vulgarity is what is Lootera !!!" 
" Lootera is a perfect evidence of being a great bollywood !!","Lootera is film that defines a perfect romance. It is a perfect dramatical film. It is similar to Hollywood films. You can compare this film with Hollywood dramatical films. Lootera is a perfect classy film. Ranveer and Sonakshi both done a great job. They make us fully satisfy by their act. All the things were perfectly described. The script was awesome. From acting to make-up all were perfect. Its a very very slow movie. Some people may say that its a bored film. But only few people can only understand the real meaning of this film lootera. And i really understood what is lootera actually.I can just say that its a fairly made film. Definitely a must watch film. You would definitely regret yourself if you will not watch these film.Its actually the Most Loved Movie of the year.Movie:- 4.5/5Music:- 4/5"

" Masterpiece!","Absolute masterpiece. A journey you get lost in. The simplicity of the the time yet the attention to detail in every scene adds visual appeal that is so palpable, yet blends with the movie without distracting from the theme and characters! I loved it. You should too! Movies such as Lootera is the reason I continue to come back to Bollywood for more! Contrary to common opinion, I found the movie to flow at a perfectly normal pace. There is a major event, twist or turn every couple minutes to keep the story moving along. Any faster and the movie would seem rushed. We all had our jaws dropped at the intermission. The first half was simply superb!" 
" Subtlety - the biggest performer!","Lootera is not a sample representation of Bollywood. But, having watched it, I would hope that this kind of cinema, be linked with Indian films. This is not a regular run on the mill, pop corn flick. Nor is it your typical rosy love story! Love story, yes! but Lootera bravely unravels what every adult, who has fallen in love experiences but, fails to express! Yes, it is these features of the screenplay and direction that make you fall in love with this movie. The dialogs are so beautiful and hardly wasted. One of the scenes where Ranveer reveals his bucket list to Sonakshi, only to figure out that it had such an important role in the climax is a simple deduction of Vikramaditya Motwane's sheer class!Every character has tremendous scope in this movie because of the movie's affinity to silence. We know how good a weapon it is for directors! Mani Ratnam showed us what silence could do! It helps the characters completely settle and express in a realistic and emotional manner. Emotional - to the exact extent! Wow!Ranveer - a career changing role for him! He is excellent in his subtle avatar of the lootera - Varun Shrivastav. His Varun Shrivastav manages to create mercy in your hearts half way down the movie when one is not supposed to! The final scene, where he breaks down before Sonakshi, literally moves you to tears! This scene is the show stealer! Period. Sonakshi, the next Vidya Balan for sure! Her change of expressions from being ecstatic to heart broken. Anger to sarcasm. Her face does it all! She is there making an impact in each and every scene, through out the movie! The support cast has done an evenly good job.On the whole, Lootera is an achievement for the romance genre itself! Motwane - another coming off age film from him. He is here to stay definitely! On the whole, magnificent! As the cliché goes - Please do yourself a favor by watching Lootera!" 
" True Cinema","A majestic portrayal about love and betray. All praises for the director Vikramaditya Motwane and the Cinematographer for making such a heart- warming and visually charming piece. A lot of people will complain that the movie was slow, but its an art movie which typical Indian audiences are not used to.The acting in this movie was perfect. Both Ranveer and Sonakshi, were outstanding although i do feel the characters could have been written a little bit better,because there were moments where you feel forced to empathize with the protagonist. The supporting actors also gave exceptional performances, especially Vikrant Massey who plays Ranveer Singh's accomplice in the movie.The music by Amit Trivedi was impressive and perfectly matched the mood of the story, with tracks like "Shikayatein", "Zinda" and "Ankahee".Overall it is a well-crafted and awe inspiring movie which you will fall in love with if you invest the patience and attention that it truly deserves."
