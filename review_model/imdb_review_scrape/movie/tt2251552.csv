" Good Nice Clean Movie... How many of those do you see today ?","This is a nice clean family movie.. One that gets a smile on your face.. Without being unnecessarily loud.. This movie is what movies were supposed to be.. Good fun where u could take your entire family to, without getting embarrassed.. How many movies that are released today can boast of that..I liked the subtle understated performances by Kainaz & Vickrant.. The storyline is unique.. The treatment of the movie is different (of course the movie is slow.. A romantic movie is supposed to be slow !!!) If u like loud, crashing, illogical, action movies u probably have already seen rowdy... This is fine dining.. It is supposed to slow u down at a leisurely pace.. The movie is telling u a love story.. It is not some south Indian juggernaut designed to numb your senses from the word "go".....Go see it !!! Take your entire family !!! Not many movies nowadays allow u to do that !!!" 
" A HOT female chauffeur in India who drives around a rude male Boss & then how the sparks fly....","Went to watch this movie after seeing the trailers and really liked it. A complete family entertainment and funny. Challo Driver is the story of Arjun Kapoor, a fiery young construction magnate and Tanya Malhotra, an arts graduate from Chandigarh — who unwittingly becomes his chauffeur.He has a penchant for firing drivers and she has a proclivity for quitting jobs until fate — and an unassuming bet — throws them into the deep end and they have to stick out together for a stipulated period of 6 months!Do sparks fly when they meet? They do, and quite explosively so! They both hate each other's guts, and the film eventually becomes a journey of two mismatched — yet equally firebrand — people learning the all- important lesson of acceptance and sensitivity towards each other, and to their surroundings.En route, it also addresses, in a lighthearted yet potent vein, all the ills — rage, lawlessness and total chaos — that plague traffic in India and the seething cauldrons that Indian roads have become! Eventually Challo Driver becomes a laugh fest that has the heart of a message- oriented film yet wears wholesome family entertainment on its sleeve — a film that will entertain, enlighten and enrich in equal measure.Do watch it to see the fresh humor which has been missing in Bollywood for a long time." 
" Extremely hilarious","This film is seriously fun!!! Excellent comedy by Manoj Pahwa and the actress Kainaz look beautiful. Clean film, so vulgar show and absolutely funny! I will say, we must give chance for such movies to really give enough attention who have unusual story line... Really a different concept and the way its shown, no job is easy is great...Once again, surely give a watch, you will end up laughing and realizing, the film those don't work in theater rule the TV screens later :)Watch with the family, a total entertainer. Every age group will love it. Challo Driver :)"
