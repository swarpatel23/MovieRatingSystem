" Surprisingly good","Although this seems like just another typical (or stereotypical) desi/NRI film, the high rating is the first indication that something else has been produced. The plot is pretty straightforward and simple and that there is a party and the film explores a number of the naive characters who attend, host or are attempting to attend that very party. The acting is solid, without involving the usual and repetitive actors, instead, a fresh new and talented team. The comedy was pretty good and overall, it was very entertaining. All in all, the producers have made a very safe and limited film as their attempt but have succeeded in making the overall impression very good. The babes are good too."
