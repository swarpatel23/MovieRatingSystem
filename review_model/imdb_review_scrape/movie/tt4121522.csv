" An anthology of good Short films","Shuruaat Ka Interval is an anthology of 8 short films on the theme of Interval,and all the films are unique in their own way as the filmmakers have interpreted the term 'Interval' diversely.While 'August' is a complex movie about a butcher and 'Gatekeeper' an excellent short about the life of the guards at railway crossing are open to interpretations.'Bubble and Stars' shows what movie characters do during interval,'Interval 3D' explores the idea of a character coming to existence due to technical problems during interval and 'Ayan' shows what happens when Ram of Ramayan goes missing in the interval.'Last Audition' shows the struggle of the struggling actors treating time between two auditions as interval.'No Exit' is again a complex movie dealing with theme of reincarnation with time between two reincarnation being the interval.'Final interval' is a very emotional movie regarding and old lady and her death.Both implying death as an interval.Some movies give you a good laugh,some make you shed tears while some keep you pondering what happened." 
" Excellent Set of Movies!","A great opportunity for all short movie directors, actors and writers, this is a great concept in which 8 short movies based on the term "Interval" were compiled from over 400 entries. These 8 movies were showcased as one complete set. The movies really outdid themselves. Some of them were by amateur actors, while some by professionals. However, all the movies were of a great caliber. My personal favourite was Final Interval. It's the story of household surrounding the grandmother. However, situations may change the fate of the household. Dhruv, the grandson, perfectly plays his role in this twist of tales. A must watch!!"
