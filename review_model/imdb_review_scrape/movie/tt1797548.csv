" Hangs in between a below average and intelligent movie.","The over famous Cricket fever in India, always has one favorable impact on Bollywood which mainly benefits all the small budget and lesser known films waiting for their respective turns to get a decent release. And due to this otherwise calm period at the box office, we get to see many such films which may have something new to showcase both in terms of storyline and performances. YEH FAASLEY is also one of those limited budget experimental kind of movies, which successfully managed to get a decent solo release due to the ongoing world cup and which also has an interesting story to tell blended with a mixture of mystery, suspense and emotional relationships.As the movie started I only knew that it was going to be something on a Father â€“ Daughter relationship with a heavy dose of emotions. But after its few initial reels, the film surprisingly turned out to be a suspense and mystery drama with some mediocre court room scenes leading to a serious and unpredictable climax. But sadly the interesting plot and few honest performances remain the only highlight of the film and overall it failed to generate any kind of excitement in the few people watching it in the theater.On paper, the script of YEH FAASLEY had many elements in it which could have been exploited in a much better manner. A daughter discovering an ugly secret about the death of her mother in an early age aiming towards her own father as a culprit was indeed a great plot to reveal. But unfortunately both the writers and the director fail to convert it into a worth watching film altogether. Frankly speaking I found the film wandering through more than one genre post its initial half an hour. Sometimes it looked like as if it was fast moving towards a plot straight out of a horror movie and then post intermission it started juggling between a court room drama, mystery and suspense movie. However, the weakest point of the film remains its poor court room scenes which give it a feel of a B grade project. Moreover the film tends to be too lengthy towards it climax and goes on a never ending kind of investigative narration which is not enjoyable at all. In all, YEH FAASLEY has only two merits in it. One is its freshness of the plot (which gives you a new insight of an unintentional crime) along with a fresh face Tena Desae, who is impressive in the role of a daughter caught in a dilemma. And second is the brilliant performance by Anupam Kher as a father who silently knows that he hasn't done anything wrong with his wife, yet keeps on suffering due to the actions taken by her own daughter. Apart from these two factors, the film fails to materialize on its strong story plot and the surprise mystery element which could have been a winner if visualized in a different manner.In addition to the above, YEH FAASLEY neither has any good soothing music nor a satisfactory cinematography which seems to be quite ill equipped, evident from many grainy and carelessly shot scenes witnessed towards its end. Also the director wastes many talented artists in the supporting cast such Seema Biswas, Pawan Malhotra, Rajendra Gupta, Sudha Chandran and Suhasini Mulay.Summing up, it can be said that with a great potential plot in its script but a feeble execution on the screen, YEH FAASLEY remains hanging between a below average and intelligent movie, which sadly fails to make any kind of impact on the viewer." 
" These distances ! Born from incomplete facts !","Yeh Faasley (these distances) is a relatively recent movie which is less known to the audience because of lack of hype and low profile cast which, among others, were the factors leading to its commercial failure. However I watched this movie on internet and found that it's not that trash. It has its moments and plus points.Other than communication gap, if something creates misunderstanding between people, then it's lack of awareness of complete information related to something or clarifying it further, incomplete knowledge of some phenomena. It is said that absolute ignorance is preferable to incomplete knowledge because it's a human instinct to fill in the gaps of information with imagination of something which may or may not be true. And this false imagination leads to misunderstanding somebody. Ditto for wrong interpretation of available facts. Communication with that particular person can resolve it and communication gap, on the contrary, reinforces it.As said above, Yeh Faasley is a father-daughter story. A Punjabi girl, Arunima Dua (Teena Desaai) who is living happily with his loving widower father, Devinder Dua (Anupam Kher) and is in love with a suitable boy, Manu (Rushad Rana); suddenly comes to know that her mother, Raagini (Rachita Bhattacharya) had not died accidentally and there's something about her death which is unknown to herself as well as the world. Though Raagini was killed in a car accident, Arunima sniffs that that accident had taken place due to some foul play and actually her mother was murdered. The obvious suspect is nobody else but her loving father only. She puts the question straightaway to him whether he had murdered his wife (and her mother) and gets a negative answer which is not able to answer all the interrelated questions following the main question. And though Devinder tells her about the strain in his marital life, she feels that something is still being hidden from her. Meeting some outsiders in this regard adds fuel to her restlessness to know the truth. She files a legal suit against her father charging him for murdering her mother. The father wins the case and gets acquitted by the court but the issue does not end. After a great emotional tension between the father and the daughter, the father is again tried in the court and this time, gets sentenced to death. However all the relevant questions have still not got their answers and when Devinder Dua is going to be hanged shortly, a couple of new questions prop up, leading to deepening of the mystery of the death of Raagini. Arunima's beau, Manu finally unearths the mystery, unmasks the real culprit and saves the life of Devinder when he's within inches' distance from the gallows.The highlight of this movie is the peculiar and very delicate relationship between an unmarried, motherless, young daughter and a loving and caring widower father which definitely renders the element of novelty to the movie. It's something stressed the most in the story and it is the most well-directed part of the movie, ably supported by the power-packed performances of the leading actors playing the father-daughter duo.The mystery is also quite good whose solution is found to be the most simple one when known in the end. However the problem with this movie is the deficiencies in screenplay and direction. The writers and the director could not decide whether to make this movie as an emotional drama or as a murder mystery. And this confusion continues for a major part of the movie, leading it to nowhere. The scenes appear to be repetitive and story (especially in the second half) seems to be dragging endlessly without a destination. The length is too much. The director would have done better had he focused on one thing only - the drama or the mystery and curtailed the length of the movie by 25-30 minutes. The excessive length has made it boring. The court-room scenes appear to be childish.Technically the movie cannot claim to be very good. Several scenes yell for want of proper light. Camera work is just average. Editor has not done his part well and allowed the movie to go beyond two and a half hours time. The background score is good though.The music composed by Deepak Pandit is good though it's virtually impossible to keep the songs in mind after the movie. However with the help of meaningful lyrics, the music director has made good situational songs.Anupam Kher and Teena Desaai have delivered outstanding performances which make this movie worth at least one watch. Teena has played a loving daughter who wants to know the truth from her father, suspecting him to be the cause behind her mother's death but when he is sentenced to death by the court, she repents. Anupam, on the other hand, has played a father who despite being innocent, gets ready to embrace the death for the sake of the mental satisfaction of his daughter. Rushad Rana has also done well. The supporting cast is studded with talented artists but all of them have been wasted in small roles.Yeh Faasley is not an excellent movie. However, it's not a bad movie either. Taking all the aspects into account, my final verdict is that this movie is not everyone's cup of tea. Despite having a good suspense element, the mystery fans may find it boring. It is mainly for the audience liking tense emotional dramas and for the fan-following of Anupam Kher."
