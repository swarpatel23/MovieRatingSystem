" What a beautiful film","Amazing, outstanding, brilliant for audience who are subtle and sensitive. A American journalist sees the story of Taj through her eyes. Excellent execution, simple and crisp. Stays to the point . Well acted and directed. The writer has to be credited for simply executing the film and subtle emotions. This a cross over film and has nothing to do with bollywood style. Its has international appeal and that is why this film fared much better in the international market rather than India and that is also because it is shot in English. The an impression. The frames in the mountains are simple painting on celluloid. A good way to feel the soul of Taj. The only minus point is that now i have to shell out money to fly to India to experience the monument of love Taj Mahal" 
" For lovers only","A extraordinary effort for those who look at at it as an international English film. For those struck in song dance bollywood melodrama it will be not as crass as they like....for such viewers it might as well be casting pearls before sw.ns Fantastic underplayed performance by the leading lady and the rest of the cast. Outstanding art design and cinematography. It bought tears in the eyes of my girlfriend. Its a beautiful film for the ones with a heart. No wonder Taj is still the wonder of the world. I am thinking of building a house of for my GF. Thanks to Taj Mahal A Monument Of Love. India looks beautiful...Kashmir is breathtaking...I would visit India to see Taj mMhal only because of this remarkable film. A film with a heart and am sure will be liked by people who have some romance in their life for others watch....loud melodramatic films on the subject." 
" Heart Warming Film","A well crafted, deftly executed film. The acting is fantastic and natural.Taj Mahal A Monument Of Love is the finest work I have ever seen from India. The film is international in content and concept and will be loved by people who are sensitive to the finer nuances of life. Its DVD is in my collector's addition. The locations are dream like, the cinematography is first rate. Last but not the least it boasts of an outstanding background score. Raghu Raj and Purnima deliver a straight from the heart performance. Director Robin is one to watch in the years to come Thanks for bringing Taj to life." 
" Classic Tale Of Love","Taj Mahal A Monument Of Love directed by Robin Khosla is a dream on celluloid. A film on the Taj made in English language was indeed a brilliant idea.The film recreates the by gone era in a visually arresting manner. The film is seen through the eyes of an American journalist who goes back into time creates an instant bond with the viewer. The acting is first rate and the film is blessed with an out of the world back ground score. Its an film for the film collectors . The locations and costumes are amazing. The film is simple but different. It has a lot of heart into it. It makes you smile cry and fall in love all over again. I salute director Robin Khosla and his crew for having the courage to make a beautiful film on the Taj. Its a film ahead of its times. Its in the league of films like Titanic, Note Book, Love Story which make you love LOVE." 
" Good effort, but failed attempt at a good story.","I recently saw this movie and thought it would be good because its in English. The only thing good about this movie were the costumes and the sets. This movie had really bad acting and a bad cast.
Spoilers below: Basicly, the movie is about an American journalist who goes to India to write a paper or something. Then she starts reading a book on the Taj Mahal. Thats when the movie starts with flashbacks to the story of the Taj Mahal.I definetly think its worth renting, but i wouldn't add it to my DVD library." 
" A Total Waste of Time","I bought the DVD of this film on the strength of the few comments (favourable) posted on the IMDb web-site. What a totally wrong decision I made! I have not seen a film with such wooden and boring acting for such a long time. I also found the production values in terms of sets and costumes to be penny-pinching in the extreme. Neither was there any real dramatic tension in the story as it was presented on the screen - in fact it came over as completely boring. In addition, the actress playing the role of Arjumand really began to get on my nerves. She made the character to be a totally whining and pathetic lady, far from - I am sure - the real historical character. And as to the music soundtrack.....what music??? This version of the story of Shah Jehan bears no comparison whatsoever - in terms of acting, drama, production values, and above all the music - to the fabulous 2005 version (for which we are still awaiting the issue of a DVD version).This really is one to avoid, but if some viewers persist, nevertheless, then don't be misled by the sales advertising on some web-sites: the main language of the film is NOT Hindi but English. The DVD of the film gives you a choice of either the Hindi version or the English version - and you can see which is the "real" version if you accidentally press the Hindi button because it becomes very clear that that version of the film is dubbed.John.
