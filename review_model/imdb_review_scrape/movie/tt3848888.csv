" The Shaukeens does show promises but the climax makes it decent entertainer","When you are remaking a classic like Basu Bhattcharya's Shaukeen, plenty of comparisons will definitely arise. The question is whether it is on par with the original one ? – Well, It was just about there but neither it did full justice to the original screenplay nor was the acting was even comparable to classic. Frustrated in life, three lecherous oldies decides to have fun in their vacation with a girl who is a die-hard fan of superstar Akshay Kumar. In order to woo the girl, they must convince Akshay Kumar to help them.There are two aspects to watch this movie. If you have already seen the classic, you might not be happy with the end product but if you are watching the film for the first time, you might enjoy it. Abhishek Sharma who previously directed the fun-loving Tere Bin Laden misses the bus this time. The movie does have some hilarious moments but only few to keep you alive. The 1st half goes fine. Even the 2nd half shows some promise but the climax plays the spoil sports and messes up completely. The songs are fine. Cinematoraphy is amazing. Art direction is captivating. Background score is just about OK. Coming to performances - Annu Kapoor , Anupam Kher and Piyush Sharma does a fine job and they will tickle your funny bone. Lisa Haydon is just about okay. Akshay Kumar does well in the supporting role. The Shaukeens does show promises but the climax makes it decent entertainer. Above average 2.75 /5https://www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk" 
" Bad remake of Shaukeens","Shaukeens was not a big hit, yet it was praised, especially the acting of Ashok Kumar,Utpal Dutt and AK Hangal all 3 on heavenly board now, The film also had Mithun and Rati play young lovers. However The Shaukeens is nothing great in comparison, actually the director keeps the main plot same but changes things to suit today's times. The 3 old men head to mauritius for some action, they first plan bangkok but their families act weird on the name of Bangkok. The 3 meet Lisa Haydon in Mauritius who is upset because of her friends giving more likes to her ex on fb(such jokes) Akshay Kumar enters at the interval and the seocnd half focuses on him trying to please a Bengali Director to get a national award, he also makes fun of himself which is getting boring now, after Srk,Salman doing the same. The film also gets lengthy and stretchedDirection is okay but expected a lot from Abhishek Kapoor who gave us TERE BIN LADEN Music is okayAmongst actors, all 3 being talented yet the chemistry and fun of the original is missing in them. Annu Kapoor is decent in his role, Piyush Mishra rarely seen in such films does well in his role, Anupam Kher being sober does a decent job Lisa Haydon is a non actress, Akshay Kumar plays himself and is okay Manoj Joshi,Cyrus Broacha are good" 
" The Trio-Oldies with their hearts still young!!!!!!","The Shaukeens is a story of three oldies - KD, Lali and Pinki. These lusty old men plan a trip to Mauritius after it becomes difficult, rather life-threatening for them to get some action in Delhi.In Mauritius the trio stay with a young fashion designer Ahana (Lisa Haydon). Ahana, a huge Akshay Kumar fan, is nursing a broken heart.Akshay Kumar (playing himself), is an alcoholic superstar desperately wanting to win the National Award. He is stuck between a Bengali director who gives him tips on method-acting and a secretary, hell bent on getting his superstar boss focus on Rs.200- cr club.When Akshay Kumar comes to Mauritius for a shoot, Ahana falls in love with him. The three oldies, needless to say, are already in love (read lust) with Ahana. In the end, who gets whom and what, is all that The Shaukeens is about.The Shaukeens is a remake, rather recreation of Basu Chatterjee's 1982 Shaukeen starring Ashok Kumar, Utapal Dutt, AK Hangal, Rati Agnihotri and Mithun Chakraborty. Directed by Abhishek Sharma, The Shukeens boasts of pace and crispy dialogs. Tigmanshu Dhulia's tight screenplay and flawless act by the three veterans make the film immensely watchable." 
" A below expectations, one time watch remake with its basic theme mostly hijacked by Akshay Kumar.","Talking about the so called remake status of THE SHAUKEENS first, its actually not a remake of any original Hindi project, since even Basu Chatterjee made his 1982 classic SHAUKEEN taking all clear inspirations from an English film titled BOYS NIGHT OUTreleased in 1962. In addition it also cannot be called as a true remake as the latest version follows a much bold path both in visual and verbal terms. Plus it also adds another fresh plot interfering into the script hampering its original enjoyable spirit to a large extent.Honestly I was pretty excited to watch THE SHAUKEENS due to its three veterans and the exclusive feature that its story-screenplay-dialogues were written by one of my favourite writer-actor-director Tigmanshu Dhulia. But unfortunately post a fine first hour and a few surprising insertions like a (wasted) cameo of Rati Agnihotri and a song from Anu Malik, the film turned out to be way below expectations, mainly because of the deliberate twists added in its second half. So till intermission it remains a good time pass with a few enjoyable sequences and performances covering up the shortcoming of an overstretched screenplay.However as the second half begins, the film starts walking on an entirely different (and downward) path, completely hijacked by Akshay Kumar himself, who was actually supposed to be there in a cameo, but probably changed his mind being the co-producer of the film too unexpectedly. Akshay begins well taking potshots on the Industry and its 'crore clubs'. But then starts taking too much space on the screen ignoring the three main heroes of the film quite strangely. Perhaps the makers forgot that the USP of this particular film happened to be the three middle aged men searching for a girl and not anything else to say it all.Anyhow due to this big miscalculated move, the film fails to pick up in its later reels, ending on another flat note all of sudden and surprisingly has many vulgar dialogues too which frankly were not expected from both Tigmanshu Dhulia and the director Abishek Sharma who superbly directed an all clean, entertaining comedy movie called TERE BIN LADEN in the past. Also I would like to mention here a particular sequence in the film, wherein before going to Malaysia, Piyush Mishra is shown coming out of Delhi's OSHO WORLD shop situated at ANSAL PLAZA holding a five CD set of "Sambhog Se Samadhi Ki Ore" in his hands. Now its quite evident that many in the country as well as abroad still associate OSHO with the word SEX showing their uneducated and underdeveloped state of mind quite clearly. But why Tigmanshu and Abishek added this specific scene into the film is really doubtful and it strongly makes me think that, "Did the two talented film-makers intend to make fun of those unaware section of people who still ignorantly associate the mystic master OSHO with SEX or they both themselves are a part of those silly mindsets still playing with the same ridiculous ideas about OSHO even in 2014?" I will definitely try to find the answer to this question if I happen to meet them ever in the future but anyway returning back to the film, its soundtrack offers a mixed bag with two catchy and two awfully rotten numbers like "Ishq Kutta" and "Alcoholic"what kind of songs were these really, I failed to understand. Placed in New Delhi and Mauritius, its cinematography doesn't offer anything great and the same can be said about its background score and editing too which actually makes the film a bit lazy and stretched unnecessarily at regular intervals.So what's there in the film that it can be watched once? - It's the cute acts of three fantastic actors Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor and Piyush Mishra playing the three sex-starved men looking for girls. Anupam plays it subtly but brilliantly (once again) along with Piyush expressing it wildly (he is a delight to watch). But the lead here is taken by Anu Kapoor enacting the bachelor Casanova with a bindaas touch, being their 'all knowing' leader of the expedition And the three put up a great show for the viewers in their scenes together. Lisa Haydon is just fine lacking that sensuality even in her almost none clothes and Cyrus Broacha is good but doesn't get much to do in his limited scenes post interval.Concluding the write up, yes you can watch THE SHAUKEENS once for the three veterans, but I personally wished to see them much more in the film than presented. In other words, I was there to watch these three exceptionally talented actors in the film from the first frame to the last and not any big actor-producer coming in to take all the limelight, ruining it all. And I really wish THE SHAUKEENS was made focusing on the three Shaukeens only and not anything else just for the sake of it.Hence give it a try if you wish but in case you haven't seen the earlier Basu Chatterjee's highly inspired but classic version of 1982 then go for it as a must and have a great time with Ashok Kumar, A. K. Hangal and Utpal Dutt playing the dirty trio." 
" some good laughs","the movie is really one of those where they have an interesting concept, but really no concrete storyline. i guess even the concept is not novel and is stolen from the old shaukeen. so, anyway, the movie starts with a concept, plays with it till the interval, and then you can see it is running out of steam; so then they complete change it and go in a totally different direction. i liked the first half, it had some good laughs, and some witty dialogues. you can't call it a well made movie, but if you go with friends and are willing to let your hair down, i guess you can unwind a bit. my wife liked the second half much more. annu kapoor gives a good performance; anupam kher is really too overexposed and overacts. the third shaukeen i have seen for the first time, but he does a good job too. akshay kumar's willingness to make fun of himself is refreshing. lisa hayden looks good but her character is not a convincing one." 
" decent entertainer","Here are two aspects to watch this movie. If you have already seen the classic, you might not be happy with the end product but if you are watching the film for the first time, you might enjoy it. Abhishek Sharma who previously directed the fun-loving Tere Bin Laden misses the bus this time. The movie does have some hilarious moments but only few to keep you alive. The 1st half goes fine. Even the 2nd half shows some promise but the climax plays the spoil sports and messes up completely. The songs are fine. Cinematoraphy is amazing. Art direction is captivating.

Akshay Kumar does well in the supporting role. The Shaukeens does show promises but the climax makes it decent entertainer. Good 6/10" 
" Excellent Remake!","Usually Bollywood does not make good remakes of old classic movies. This one is a rare exception. This is a remake of the 1982 movie Shaukeen. That one was based in Bombay and Goa while this one is based in Delhi and Mauritius. The story is about three older men who lust after younger women and how it takes them to 'greener pastures'. The strong point of this movie is superb dialogues. The casting was perfect too. You have to watch the movie to appreciate that. Out of the older three men, I feel it was Annu Kapoor who has stolen the show! He is just too good as KD, a typical Delhiite. The rest of the cast has also done justice to their roles. Without revealing the actual story, I strongly suggest that you go watch this movie in a theater to get the full enjoyment. If you want a good laugh and a fun time, go for it. Its an excellent remake!" 
" The movie sets the highest bar","As we know that how the movie Happy New Year set the highest bar up until the release of The Shaukeens for the worst movie ever. Well, The Shaukeens has managed to set an even higher bar. It was way beyond abysmal. The plot of the movie is pathetic. The direction was poor. It wasn't suitable for kids, I wonder how the board certified the movie as U/A. Now that I think about it, I wasted another 3 hours of my life on Bollywood. However, the song "Manali Trance" wasn't that bad, Honey Singh did make the song poor. It was the only good part of the movie. These type of movies are degrading the quality of Bollywood. There were a lot of good movies before the past few years. I don't know what's wrong with Bollywood.Conclusion: On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate the movie a negative 20." 
" Bad Choice","I won't compare it to the original movie "Shaukeens" as it can not be compared at all. This is worst movie ever Akshay has acted in. I think he keeps signing the same kind of movies again and again which do not have storyline or acting. Lisa Hayden is not at all suited in this movie, it was a headache to watch her act. Anupam has kept the flow going and Anu Kapoor has played the role of his usual character. Movie has some funny moments.If you have already seen the original Shaukeens then you will feel bad you chose to watch this movie.If you have nothing else to watch , go for it." 
" Shaukeens","Three Libidinous oldies, one crazy bimbette and a reigning superstar - with these oddballs, director Abhishek Sharma (of Tere Bin Laden fame)revisits the Bollywood classic 'Shaukeen',but with genX humor and plenty of uproarious moments.When Two is Company, Three is Crime. With an interesting voice-over of Akshay Kumar (who plays himself!) introducing the lecherous threesome, we get a glimpse of their lives through the antics which primarily begins with a daily dose of visual Viagra in the jogging park and ends with goofing it up.'Umar Pachpan ki par Dil Bachpan Ka' is the underlying characteristic of the incorrigible Laali(Anupam Kher),Pinki(Piyush Mishra) and the bachelor KD(Annu Kapoor) who are crazy to get into some 'Ohh-la-la' fling.After a couple of their attempts misfire, the trio heads to the scenic Mauritius,much away from the radar of their policing families.And as luck would have it, they stumble upon the gorgeous and sultry Ahana,the 'Earth Child'(Lisa Haydon)who swoons them with her oomph.Ahana is a die-hard Akshay kumar fan and when the trio learns it, each one of them begins his pursuit to please her with the hope of a return favor.The Shaukeens, written by Tigmanshu Dhulia , borrows the template from the 1980 film with the same title, but doesn't match up to the spontaneity of the plot or the ingenuity with which the stalwarts(Ashok Kumar, Utpal Dutt and AK Hangal)had approached their characters in the original. And here,I would blame it on the shoddy writing and uninspiring screenplay which overclouds the talents of the cast.The sexual innuendos,the projection of Bangkok in poor light or the trio's repeated request to Ahana to slip into bikini makes you cringe after a point in time, ignoring the fact that the lass is more concerned about the number of likes on her FB pics.Agree, the jokes might appear crass in the beginning but you get to redeem your boredom with the entry of Akshay Kumar. Taking digs at self seems to be latest mantra in Bollywood and Akshay does it sportingly with a great élan.As an 'Alcoholic' actor desperate to win a national award, his self-deprecating humor works enormously for the benefit of the film and us.And here I would give brownie points to the writers who competently synergize the main plot with Akshay's part.What can also be appreciated about the Shaukeens is the chemistry between the three oldies and their comic banters. They are the best of friends otherwise , but the most hopeless competitors under the influence of Ahana. Among the lot,I liked Annu Kapoor the most. With his nymph in crescendo,Annu makes his character despicable for the dignified viewer,yet evoking the likability to root for. Actors in cameo - Cyrus Broacha, Gaurav Gera and Subrat Dutta are a pleasure to watch.Not to forget, the other celebrities of the Bollywood film fraternity - Abhishek,Sunil Shetty, Kareena and Dimple Kapadia!Shaukeens is not a bad movie, it makes for a fun watch.Its like a piece of creamy cake.The fun lasts till the glossy garnishing is over." 
" Dil toh JAWAN HAI!!!","Lalchand (anupam kher), KD (annu kapoor), Pinky (piyush) are three oldies who are keen to have some spice in life and they go to Mauritius for a vacation. They rent the house of the young and sexy beauty Aahana (lisa haydon) and fall for her. Meanwhile, Aahana goes through a breakup and she wants to end her life but there she sees her favorite star Akshay Kumar (akshay) shooting. The three oldies decide to win Aahana's heart by introducing her to Akshay. What happens from there forms the rest.The director has come up with a hilarious storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was quite absorbing. The dialogues were well written. The script was above average and the screenplay made it lot better. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the royalty while the art department was majestic. Anupam Kher was at his best once again while Annu Kapoor was excellent, Piyush Mishra was perfect. Lisa Haydon was smoking hot and performed well. Akshay Kumar was the surprise package with impressive act. The rest did their bit as required.The film is the remake of the yesteryears hit of the 80s and true to the original, it stood well. The first half goes about with elements of comedy, some glamour and well narrated layering of the plot. The interval bang was interesting and the second half had enough share of fun moments. Overall, this is a film which is somewhat offbeat but it had those situations which really tickle your funnybone. Overall an enjoyable comic fare, laced with hilarious moments, the film is made on sensitive topic, but nots vulgar at all. Recommended. 3.25/5* or 6.5/10" 
" amazing movie, do watch","Akshay Kumar is simply awesome in the movie and dialogs are hilarious.

Ahana, a huge Akshay Kumar fan, is nursing a broken heart.REVIEW: Piyush Mishra as Pinki, a mousy spice merchant, leads the pack with his super act, Akshay Kumar, is the surprise package of the film. Akshay as a superstar trapped in his own image is hilarious. He should take up more films like The Shaukeens.Lissom Lisa Haydon as Ahana looks sexy yet sweet but needs to work on her acting skills.Abhishek Sharma, who gave us the delightful Tere Bin Laden, does a great job with The Shaukeens too. The film, despite its theme does not get crass or vulgar even once, which is why it will get a larger audience.BEST BOLLYWOOD MOVIE OF 2014 __/\__" 
" Delightfull Shaukeens...","Much Hyped...due to the newness in its concept...Shaukeen have some filthy yet amazing bone tickling performances...One thing should be kept in mind..that one m,ust watch it without comparing it with 1982 classic Shaukeen....The story revolves around three friend in 60s who were not satisfied of their personal lives and go on using each and every trick to get laid and how it got entangled with the life of a Bubbly Bronze Diva and a successful yet unsatisfied actor,whose ultimate goall is to get a national award..Good Things: Indian movies are really doing good in case of Cinematography, screenplay and other Editing Technicalities...Exotic locations, those peacocks, sea beaches and Side views were pretty..Now what was really good were some of the background scores they used throughout the movie...Among the Songs, only Manali Trance was new and different, rest even doesn't count..Those About the stars of the show...Three friends who played their character with so much lust and vulgarity, that justified the title of the flick...Anupam Kher, an actor per excellence, the half grimacing, frontal furrowed look he mantained throughout the movie, were just funny and hilarious. The overconfident Playboy, Anu Kapoor is indeed a playboy and charmer And the third of the trio Mr.Mishra aka Pinky, he is the best of the lot...His whole body was dipped in lust and more lust...His eye expressions, lip movements were just so perfectly lusty, that a cop can throw him behind bars anytime, just going by his expressions...The conversation between the trio whether it is regarding the swim trunks or getting an escort were perfectly timed and brilliantly performed...And My My Liza Aka Ahana the role was made for u only gal...Perfect acting, with all those touches of dumbness and that stalker attitude and her obsession for Facebook, made the flick more hilarious...Gaurav Gera and Cyrus need special mentioning, they were good...Bad Points: Though Akshay tried to make fun out of himself...but those portions were loosely woven and little bit lacking in Fun quota..The end was not so grippy....But inspite of those bad points...The Shaukeens is a watchable trade....Its fresh..." 
" Trash","This movie is completely trash. Embarrassing that people actually thought this was decent. Its all about dirty old men which is so tasteless and it fails to promote any positive behavior. Movies like these that glorify poor behavior towards women is part of the reason why India has a epidemic issue of viewing women as a piece of property that leads and had lead to the various issues we see in the media today.Difficult to say what about this movie is watchable. The music is pleasant but the lyrics are suited for a college crowd. Hopefully in the future Bollywood directors refrains from using such scripts, actors stop acting for such movies, and people start increasing their standards in movie watching." 
" The most boring movie i have ever seen","The movie miserably failed to make me laugh after the first 10 minutes. There was nothing to see but three old tharkis trying to get into a girl's pants. It seemed like a side story of another movie that gets 15 mins of screen time but this one ran for 2 hours. Even the no-brainers bollywood is coming up with these days like "singham returns" or "kick" were more entertaining than this. At least their action made me laugh! Oh and Akshay Kumar's role is nothing more than a guest appearance so don't be fooled by the trailers. Its a waste of money and time. I would prefer watching and empty wall for 2 hours over this.I wish i could unsee this piece of turd but now its left a scar on my brain."
