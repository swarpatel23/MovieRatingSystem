" As usual Govinda, and he nailed it","It's a full of comedy. Where govinda and Johnny Lever paired. Kader Khan made the comedy more hilarious. And remember, for laughing on comedies, brain should not use. Music is also worth. Govinda and Johnny are best, you will admit after watching this movie." 
" another no-brainer from David Dhawan","Kunwara is another no-brainer from the DD-Govinda department. Nothing is in the right place in this film. The plot looks ridiculous with lots of comedy scenes thrown in coupled with songs and dances which come abruptly without any valid situations.Govinda is his usual self. He excels at comedy but an actor he is not. Urmila tries hard to make us tickle but fails miserably. Nagma looks lost and this is easily one of her worst performances. Om Puri is wasted and Kader Khan is not too bad.Overall, Kunwara is another disaster after Chal Mere Bhai and Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge from the David Dhawan camp. Don't watch it unless you want to laugh hard!"
