" Finally a strong competition for RGV's Aag","So finally RGV take a breather for Karz with Zzzz is here to displace him from the top spot. HR:: Disappointing considering there should be improvement in performance after Aap Ka Suroor. Urmila:: Performance-wise I never regarded highly of Simi but after watching the new Kamini, hats off to the Simi. Urmila even if you have to get "on-your-fours" to return to RGV camp, do it!Shweta Kumar is hopeless. Even Danny & Gulshan Grover is below the par. Rohini Hattangadi was alright. Dino Morea was hardly there. Raj Babbar & Himani Shivpuri track was unwarranted. There was no point of messing with the original and develop the half- baked "HR-Urmila" track. I presume they decided to copy something from the original's original Peter Proud. Music:: Thanks to the diversion, the quality is deteriorating big time. Hardly there is a number which can be called as HR-class. Satish Kaushik:: You are better off making frame-to-frame copies of South-Indian to Bollywood and perhaps you should have done the same for Karz to Karzzzz." 
" zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","Bad cinema can almost always be expected from Satish Kaushik and if you are to watch any of them, might as well gather your friends so that you can enjoy poking fun at the trashiness. 'Karzzzzzz' is trashy cinema alright but it's not among the worst to come out this year. Most of it is unintentionally funny and it is just plain silly. Himesh Reshmi is quite bad (but he's not the worst actor around). His wig is quite amusing. His voice is not. He plays the reincarnation of Ravi (played by B-grade actor Dino Morea). Urmila Matondkar makes the best of her one-dimensional Kamini. It's good to see her in a full-fledged villainess role again. If only it were in a better movie. The makeup department does a good job in making the old Kamini look like a plastic beauty with hints of aging compared to the young babe of 1976. I still don't understand why an actress of her calbire would pick such projects. If you're only going to do a film or two per year, might as well pick something worthwhile. Though I can see why she would choose the role as it is an interesting part it's just that the film is too bad for one to take notice of acting. That Shweta Kumar has nice eyes (certainly better looking than Khansika Potwani). The other cast members are forgettable. The abysmal songs deserve to be skipped and that's what I did. Overall, this is a terrible film but it's awfulness does induce some laughter." 
" Awful remake","Truly awful remake starring Himesh Reshammiya, who cannot dance or sing well enough to make the musical numbers a success and does not have the acting ability to carry a film of this type. I never believed he was a famous rock star that made girls faint, and the fact the he shaves and waxes his chest to the point of leaving little scars is just kind of creepy (why would they feature that with all the open collar and unbuttoned shirts?).Some of the locations are beautiful, however and a few members of the cast do not struggle with their roles. There is some rather corny "injected humor" (the guy constantly talking about his daughters and efforts to marry them off) that doesn't come off well. Overall, was very disappointing." 
" Tandoori Nights","That's the name of a restaurant close to my place that I was intending to try. After watching this movie and listening to a song titled 'Tandoori Nights' in this movie, I have decided not to. I am not even sure I will look at tandoori food the same way again. Please avoid this movie at all cost if you want to keep enjoying tandoori chicken, tandoori prawns, tandoori malai kabob, and other tandoori items." 
" Fails to Entertain!","A remake of the 1980 cult-hit 'Karz', re-titled with a thousand more ZZZZ, comes out a disappointment. Satish Kaushik, a veteran in the Indian Film Industry, has made competent films before. But, in 'Karzzzz' he hits a low. When you remake a successful film, your ought to stay faithful to it. But over-here, there is a new twist, which, simply doesn't work.Urmila reprises the role of Simi, the vamp. Dino does a cameo as what Raj Kiran did. Himesh, is Rishi Kapoor "The Iconic Hero" Monty. It's a musical, and yes "In This Department", the soundtrack is as magical as the original. Till now everything is going steady.But! But! But!... this remake has a sloppy second hour. The twist in the tale, lacks legs. It struggles to walk, but it is simply handicap. The climax, is very poor. It leaves no impact whatsoever! Also, Characters played by Gulshan Grover & Raj Babbar do nothing in the film. Why put these characters in the first place? Satish Kaushik's direction is alright. The screenplay goes for a toss. Himesh's Soundtrack is fantastic. In fact, the sole saving grace. Each song has a feel to it, and each is memorable. Bravo, indeed! In the acting department, Himesh is not bad at all. Comparing him to Rishi Kapoor is like comparing a Fish to a Shark! As Monty, he has done fairly well. Urmila hams as the Vamp. New-Find Shweta Kumar is passable. Danny Denzongpa is bland. Rohini Hattangadi doesn't get much scope. Gulshan Grover is wasted in an ill-written role. Ditto for Raj Babbar. Dino Morea in a special appearance, is decent. Bakhtiyaar Irani is mechanical.On the whole, Watch the original again. But if you really want to watch this 2008 box office flop, I suggest you only expect scant entertainment from this one!" 
" A Dreadful Remake. Not Worth It!","I knew that this was a re Â– make of the 1980 Subash Ghai hit, "Karz" and also knew that it was about reincarnation.I wonder what made Satish Kaushik do this film? He has achieved so much with his other previous films which has included "Tere Naam" and yet with this one he has added on just four "zzzzz." In terms of acting, Himesh Rehsamiya cannot be compared or matched to Rishi Kapoor in any way whatsoever. He is not just able to portray the emotions that are required in such genre movies and his voice for playback singing is, I am sorry to say for all "die hard" fans of his, is no way near to the quality that the late Kishore Kumar had. Frankly, I was looking forward to listening to "Ek Haseena Thi" but was disappointed with it. This particular song requires a rather high, strong and powerful voice, which can carry the words directly into the heart of the audience and Himesh Reshamiya just does not have that type of voice. He is unable to dance as well and this is what Rishi Kapoor was considered to be terrific at. Instead he should stick to composing music at which he is talented.The Director has introduced a new actress, Shweta Kumar and considering that she is new, unfortunately for her, the role seemed incorrect to launch her career. There was no intensity of chemistry between her character and that of "Monty," played by Himesh Reshamiya, which leads me to write that perhaps the audience will realise how capable Mrs Tina Ambani (Tina Munim) really was and that perhaps she should be considered for life time achievement award.Danny Denzongpa plays the role that Pran did, but unfortunately, even though he is a good actor, this was a let down. The same applies to Urmila Matondkar, who plays the role of Kamini, which was originally played by Simi Garewall.Be warned: Watch out for the song "Ta Ta Tana tandoori nights" and make sure that you are not eating anything at the time as it may just make you laugh and threw it all out and create problems with the person either sitting in front of you or beside you. Also be sure that you are either holding onto your seat or have a seat belt to hold you in the event of you falling off the chair by laughing and holding your stomach.The film also has its flaws, which, again to me, was conspicuous. Every now and then, the South African city of Cape Town is mentioned as well as Kenya, which is a country in East Africa and to me it seemed that either the script writers had it wrong as it shows vineyards when it is suppose to be Kenya, which is a country and not a town and Geographically it has no vineyards and is more famous for its tea plantations and coffee. While South Africa is famous for its vine Conclusion: This film is a complete let down as well as disappointing and should not have really been made and therefore it is better to watch the original any day." 
" Crap Movie, Waste of Time","Himesh Reshammiya is back with Karzzz and yet again as a Music Director, Singer and the main actor. In future he will be back as camera man, director, producer & even light man anyways this is truly awful movie, complete waste of time. As a singer in this movie he will be mostly well known for his god-awful nasal twang and 2) his fake wig! It looks as if he bought that wig from some cheap discount store in Bombay, Quite a deadly combo don't you think. However jokes apart. His nasal twang has become familiar in every household of India, is all set to torment the in this film Karzzzz. Watching Aap Ka Suroor was the biggest punishment and now he's in this movie again. If you are one of many, who think Himesh Reshammiya looks funny with his cap on then check him out without cap in this movie Karzzzz. I bet you will fall off your chair laughing. . Talking about his music his lyricist won't have to do a lot of computer work. When he's writing the lyrics on his computer, he can just write 'auuuuuu' or 'owwww' and then Ctrl+c and Ctrl+V it wherever fillers are required. Except for the a,e,i,o,u keys on his computer, the rest of the keys must be a little dusty. He came in a movie 'Aap ka suroor - the movi'ee'....that's how its spelt and now in Karzzzz I don't get it why they added 4 z's at last? to add more emotions or what ?? I do not know whether he uses pathetic instruments or what but u just consider the opening music of the song "Lut Jaaon Lut Jaaon" its such a crap I mean it defines the word crap. Some argue that Himesh has had several hits but when he sings then it's like a car coming to a screeching halt. Terrible comparison there? He sounds loud, nasal, sometimes feels like crying while singing and other times makes you wonder why is he singing. God gave us nose for breathing not for singing and I personally think he is friend of Osama....he also torture innocent people and himesh also torture innocent people. Only difference is that himesh torture with his songs.... USA has taken action on Osama but we can't take any action against him...only we could do that just close your ears by your hands....Personally I look for music that has a certain amount of shelf-life. Unfortunately none of his albums have a good shelf-life of say beyond a month. If I have to go and buy an album, I'd much rather prefer an AR Rehman to Himesh Reshammiya. If you reading this himesh then concentrate on your music only and take some classes from AR Rehman or else stop giving music.Actually himesh should change his profession because singing is not the bed of roses.." 
" Watchable not Wonderful","Some people did not like the idea of Himesh Reshammiya playing the part made famous by Rishi Kapoor, this remake has a lot going for it because the original is supposed to be really good (although I've not seen it). Himesh has worked on some of the original songs and adding new ones. Another reason why this film had so much hype is because to see Urmila Matondkar, who plays the villainous role originally done by Simi Garewal. I intended to see it because I like Himesh and his music. It is directed by Satish Kaushik and he always took Himesh to compose music for his previous films and this time he is taking him for the lead role.The film wasn't bad but not that good either. The story was good but wasn't entertaining or exciting. After watching it I figured out that Om Shanti Om was inspired by the original Karz and that was a lot better than this remake. Remakes don't bother me but I felt that this one was not needed because we already had Om Shanti Om last year. The music is good, the best songs are Ek Hasina Thi & Tandoori Nights and the worst is Hari Om. Overall I won't recommend it to those who don't like Himesh or/and has seen Om Shanti Om. So far the best remake is Don." 
" Painfully plodding remake with a very weak Himesh Reshammiya","Why was this film made? Was it really necessary to make a lifeless and plodding remake of Subhash Ghai's film when 'Om Shanti Om' had already done so, and that too in a completely refreshing manner. Anyway, doubters can rejoice. The film is as bad as feared. It's basically a wannabe star vehicle for singer Himesh Reshammiya. Unfortunately he is a very bad actor and stands and pouts while delivering his lines. Urmila is wasted in a role made famous by Simi Garewal. Even the soundtrack is surprisingly dull with Himesh's voice not up to the task. Avoid! Overall 1/10" 
" Another farce from bollywood","Bad acting, some terrible dialogue, and it drags for close to THREE HOURS...this film should be an embarrassment to anyone and everyone involved with it. I mean, the plot, which is a ridiculous one involving reincarnation anyway, is diluted by too many sub-plots and useless characters that make the film delve to never seen before depths of awfulness. Bollywood directors really need to understand that a sane, reasonably educated and informed individual can NOT buy the crap comedy, done-to-death dialogues and mothers who behave ABNORMALLY! This is clearly a badly made film with bad actors, but the lead actor really takes the cake for I've never seen a person carry a single expression through an entire film! As for the ladies, they are worse. The music is terrible with most songs sounding like horrible spin offs of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan compositions.This film is not even worth the celluloid it was shot on, forget about your price of admission!" 
" Awesome reincarnation","I liked Urmila's and Himesh's acting, really a good remake" 
" Quite simply one of the worst Bollywood movies I have seen in a long time","I am normally quite tolerant when it comes to movies but this movie tried my patience to no end.Given my affection for the original Karz, I was a tad apprehensive about giving it a chance, which was why I put it off for a good number of years. After hearing Himesh Reshammiya's version of Ek Hasina Thi I was swayed and decided to give it a shot. The song had such a haunting quality and was frankly surprised by how good it was. Sadly the song is the only decent thing about this movie. Honestly I am surprised how Satish Kaushik could make such an amateur movie, I wouldn't expect this kind of movie from a film student let alone a veteran director. This movie is a failure in almost every department. Honestly it's worse than a B Grade movie.The performances from the leads, Himesh and Shweta Kumar (daughter of director Indra Kumar) are two of the worst performances I have seen in any movie. Himesh somehow managed to bag a few more movies but Shweta only managed to star in her dad's Super Nani after this. Even seasoned pros like Urmila and Raj Babbar ham it up really badly. I was surprised at Urmila particularly because I thought she did well in the Ek Hasina Thi number, her expressions during the song were spot on. Although I never expected to measure upto Simi Garewal, I expected better from her. It was embarrassing to see Gulshan Grover slumming it in a thankless role. Some very poor choices have been said throughout this movie, like for instance in the scene where Himesh goes to see Asrani to know the whereabouts of Ravi Verma's family and for some inexplicable reason mid conversation it shifts to a comedy track and then goes serious again. What should have been a good dramatic moment is ruined completely. Another disappointment was that apart of Ek Hasina thi, there are no other good songs in this movie. Given the classic status of the original, the people involved should at least have done a half decent job so that it does justice to the former. When Karzzz should have been thrilling and suspenseful, it evokes no other reaction for me other than sheer disdain for all the people involved in the making of this movie. Seeing the end result must have been a real slap in the face for Subhash Ghai and everyone else involved with the original. I would love to hear their reactions to the atrocity that is Karzzz. In my opinion it is up there with such Hollywood atrocities like Batman and Robin and Superman 4: A Quest for Peace.OK rant over, thank you for listening." 
" Not at par of Satish Kaushik","The aim of making this movie was to remake karz(1980) directed by Subhash Ghai. As one can easily see, the movie was meant to be a "Masala Movie" and it actually suffices many requirements.Although music by Himesh was not all bad, first few songs, including Hari Om, are un-tolerable. A couple of songs are actually good including Ek Haseena Thi, which is directly taken from original movie Karz.Satish Kaushik being a nice director, one cannot expect this kind of film from him. The major flaw in the direction was: in many scenes, focus was on "style" than on part of story that is supposed to be conveyed.Even if he is not a classical singer, Himesh sung the song Ek Haseena Thi, well enough to compare his voice to original singer." 
" Please leave the Golden Hits of Past alone in their Hall of Fame.","I had my doubts as the movie started and not only all my doubts were right but the film went even beyond my suspicion. First of all, I am completely not in the favor of re-doing any past hit. This in my opinion simply shows that we are out of ideas now. Secondly, even if you have decided to remake a Hit then at least you should do it in your own style and with little innovations added to it. But "Karzzz" just goes on following the original flick scene after scene. Not only exact scenes but the dialogues are also taken as it is from the Rishi Kapoor starrer. You find Rishi Kapoor echoing in the whole movie and Himesh just looks likes imitating.Though comparisons are inevitable, but lets drop that and see Karzzz as a movie on its own. In that case also it fails to hold you tight and is not able to create enough excitement and interest in the viewer. Even if I consider it as a first timer who hasn't seen the original "Karz", then also I don't find this version convincing enough. Now, the reasons why I found it, not comparable to the Golden Hit of the past.One Â– The Acting. All the participants in the cast are trying to overshadow each other, trying to put up a confident show which is clearly visible. Himesh doesn't suit the role completely with his strange hair style (who suggested him that?). He looks uncomfortable doing action scenes and the viewer just can digest him doing the fight sequences. What worked in "Aap Ka Suroor" was his image, which is missing in this attempt. Urmila is not the Urmila we have seen in "Ek Hasina Thi". There is completely a different actress here doing the "Simi Grewal" act. There is a huge confusion in the age gap of the characters. If Himesh has re-incarnated and is 25+ now, In that case Urmila should be at least 50. But there is no white hair and old age signs and she seems to have the ageless formula with her. Simply indigestible. The debutant Shweta Kumar is sweet, but has a long way to go and may find the road tough in the future. The killing looks of Tina Munim were missing which was the reason why the desired romantic touch was not generated.Second Â– The warmth of Durga Khote as the mother was lost since Rohini Hattangiri did it in a highly dramatic way. The emotion of a mother had a great pull in the original which touched you emotionally but you will not find it here.Third Â– Where was the lovable act of Pran as "Kabira" and cunning looks of "Premnath" as Sir Juda? Danny as "Kabira" is simply a miscast and his love for Hindi movies could not strike a chord. He was doing just another role in the movie with nothing special. Gulshan Grover as Sir Juda is also wasted as he is not given the required time to prove himself.Fourth Â– The Background Music Â– In the original, a central character was the background score which pulled you in. That is not there in the musical man Himesh's version of the classic. I really expected the background music to be chilling but was disappointed.Fifth Â– The Songs Â– Himesh always comes up with catchy beats and dance numbers which can be easily played in the Discos and dance floors. But a subject like" Karz" needs more emotional music and love songs than just dance numbers. Himesh kept following his own success path of music with beats and sound designs and he forgot to add emotions and calmness in the songs as required by the theme.So, the movie was not as expected and was below the mark. In short Subhash Ghai got inspired by "The Reincarnation of Peter Proud" and made "Karz", which proved to be a better product. Following the tradition, now Himesh also gets in the same mood but comes up with a Lazy inspired product relying too much on the music and his golden touch. The laziness is also there in its name too i.e. Karzzzzzzzzz.For first timers, it is just an OK product with some good music. But I will have to see the Original "Karz" again to wipe this off from my memory and get those sweet musical moments back." 
" Lives Up To The Hype","Let's get one thing straight. And this is very, very important and one shouldn't overlook this fact. This is a masala film; the makers never ever promised new-age cinema. Given the fact that KARZZZZ talks of reincarnation, plus there's a dash of mythology, as also everything that goes into the making of an entertainer, just don't expect anything path-breaking from KARZZZZ. Also, don't expect KARZZZZ to pander to the tastes of the multiplex junta. Himesh may not have the charisma of SRK, he may not be talented like Aamir, he may not be dashing and debonair as Salman and Akshay, but you can't turn your eyes away from the fact that he has oodles of confidence and that makes the job easier. Also, comparisons with Rishi Kapoor are inevitable. Well, Rishi Kapoor was matchless and KARZ continues to remain a shining medal to this date, but even the harshest of critics would agree that Himesh is here to stay. The Music is Fantastic and Himesh is the one to carry this film Urmilla is great and newcomer Shweta Kumar is pretty but she doesn't get enough of a role. Overall Karzzzz lives up to the hype and go and watch it right now" 
" Nothing to Watch Except Urmila !","Remaking a movie in today's times is committing next to knock out yourself and the same goes with Karzzzz. I just don't understand why there was a need to attempt a Remake when the original itself isn't a great box office success. Ask Subhash Ghai who made the film and he doesn't consider it a success.Well Mr Himesh's desperate attempt to do the role of Monty caused him great failure. This guy has been a great friend of Bhushan Kumar the film producer and he kept insisted him to make a 'Karzzz Remake' and the friend agreed WOW !Well there is nothing in this movie that I can actually talk about. Oh! one important thing I would like to mention that I haven't seen the old Karz yet. May be that could be the reason I being able to tolerate this movie. Himesh is Worst for this role, I think anyone can act better than him. Because if Worst can be given a chance. The 'Bad' will be much much better.Danny is good but not comparable to Pran. But Why should I blame him? he is a skilled Actor. It is clear while watching the movie his character was developed half-baked. He is still enoyable. Rohini Hathkandi is great. Her choice for being Monty's mom was the best. Debutant Shweta Kumar is not here to stay in bollywood. There are many likes of her in the industry. Music is strictly OK...Best Song would be 'Tere Bin Chain Na Aave' others are just absurd including the weird 'Tandoori Nights'!Now I should come to the best part of this Film and it has to be none other than Urmila Matondkar. I have gone through many reviews on the net and also here and found that most of the reviews have been truly biased regarding Urmila's performance because mainly they have just watched the film to compare this to the Original. I am quite confident about those who haven't watched the old karz, If they watch the new one they will not stop raving about Urmila. She was the only saving grace. Although her performance can't be compared to her gem roles in previous movies, yet she was excellent. If the movie is itself crap its difficult to find any positivity. Reviewers say that she shakes, quivers and shivers in the movie every now and then, its laughable. This movie wasn't an Ek Hasina thi or Pinjar that you can detail on a performance. Anyways, If she wasn't good she wouldn't have nominated for her role in award functions. The producers of the film didn't take advantage of her fully. An actress who is famous for her dancing in bollywood. It was shocking that they didn't even given her a decent dance number to perform so that she could win back her following. I could see her disappointment in her interviews regarding her 'Signature Dancing' missing in this movie. All in all I can definitely say If there is any sugar in this stinky coffee...Its Urmila Matondkar and only her."
