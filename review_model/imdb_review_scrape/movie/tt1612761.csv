" Fully Faltoo","Well this movie retains the essence it's title, it's totally idiotic. Never mind the light reference to someone in special in the Indian TV world. Well Hrishitaa proves herself once again that though she has a funny bone but no glamor or acting capability as such. When Sushant Singh first came in the scenario he showed a lots of promise but I guess he has lost the edge, reminds me of Irfaan Pathan (the cricketer :P). And what with the awful accent of his trying to mimic someone! Well Surendra Pal as himself (or not didn't get it though) was cool addition I would say. The side kicks Upasna Singh and Milind Gunaji did there part well. With a special mention to Upasna, she is like lady Johny Leven, these days no movie is complete without her. She seems to fill the place left by Tuntuni as a consistent female comedian. Anyways it was good past time. Low budget film with low budget stars did keep its promise as a low budget time pass comedy.PS: The second half is better plotted than the first."
