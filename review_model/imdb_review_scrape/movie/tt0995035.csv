" Dhol","I have seen the original one (In Harihar Nagar) & that made me see Dhol, because In Harihar Nagar was totally awesome! Even though In Harihar Nagar is more exciting than Dhol, still I feel this as a really good movie.The story is about 4 friends - Sameer, Pankaj, Gautham & Markand who are good for nothing & want to be rich all of an instant without any effort. After trying to start a business ( & fails ), they get an idea of marrying a rich girl to be rich instantly. Thus Ritu comes to their life who is from a rich family & all 4 of them try their best to win her heart. The movie then goes with the guys trying to woo her & failing miserably. The story takes a turn at the second half & the second half is different from the original movie slightly. Regarding the performances, Tusshar & Sarman Joshi were their usual self like in the previous multistarrers like Golmaal. The one who entertained me (unexpectedly) was Kunal Khemu. Rajpal Yadav was a little disappointing, but did a somewhat good performance. Whoever saw Dhol says Tanushree Dutta was terrible, but I don't complain about that because in the original flick, Gita Vijayan was far awful compared to Tanushri. Overall, the movie is a good watch." 
" ALAKAZAM Review","Very funny!!!! When I find my self in find myself in times of trouble DHOL comes to me speaking words of wisdom. Very awesome all dialogs of RajPal Yadav's dialogs are awesome!!! Get the DVD it is awesome very funny. The surnames seen is one of the funniest scenes of the movie the acting of the four is very good. In 2007, when I first saw it I was kicked out of the theater right after the surname scene then I went for another show and the next half was also awesome and then they add a bit of suspense to it. Very good movie! Must watch. The DVD now is very rare and is very weird if you see it. Many many funny scenes in it but it comes very often on TV, frequently" 
" Dhol audience ka Bajega","After 'films' like 'Hulchul', 'Garam Masala', 'Bhagam Bhag', 'Bhool Bulaiyaa' and whatever crap, director Priyadarshan has gained the reputation of being one of the worst directors today. 'Dhol' only further confirms that spot. I got to watch this piece of litter when I was visiting my parents.'Dhol' too features some of the worst actors (e.g. Tanushree Dutta, Rasika Joshi, Tushar Kapoor etc). There is no story. Direction is ...well, there is no direction. All the performances are of abysmal quality. Rajpal Yadav is the only one who's remotely funny but I'd advise his fans to watch something else, well, pretty much anything else. The songs are better forgotten except Payal Rohatgi's item number which is pleasant to the ears. This is one tacky film that should be seriously avoided." 
" Its a okayish movie","Saw the trailers and was very excited and had very high hopes from the movie. But alas it doesn't stand up to its previews. A story about 4 boys and how they chase a rich gal and get entangled in unexpected mess. It hardly manages to evoke any laughter, save for a few moments. Sharman Joshi is good in this movie, actually the only saving grace. Kunal, Rajpal and Tusshar are not so good, Tanushree (for whom i have always had hots) is good looker, but so bad in acting that she can give Aishwarya's acting skills a run for money. Apart from the title song, no other song worth mentionable but kudos to the director for not using too many songs so that we could get away with the ordeal soon. All in all, watch it when you have no other choice and make sure you have lots of friends so that you won't be the only one to suffer through it." 
" typical Priyadarshan flick minus quality humor","This is your typical Priyadarshan movie--a bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission. His signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money. Whether it is a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., etc., the director is becoming ridiculously predictable. Don't get me wrong; as clichéd and preposterous his movies may be, I usually end up enjoying the comedy. However, in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri being noteworthy ones). Now, the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over again.Songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks awesome. Rajpal Yadav is irritating, and Tusshar is not a whole lot better. Kunal Khemu is OK, and Sharman Joshi is the best." 
" Another Lackluster Comedy","Priysdarshan started his Bollywood career with a bang directing movies like Hera-Pheri and Hungama but recently his graph is going down as his movies now lack a good story(sometimes there is no solid plot in the movie as is the case with Dhol where things seem to happen out of nowhere) and the comedy standards which he promised with his earlier flicks.Speaking of Dhol ,it has no plot .The story is of four friends(which is very common in recent movies where the focus is on a group of friends EX Golmaal,Dhamaal,Heyy Baby etc) who want to impress a girl (who is the only heir to her rich grandfather and grandmother).They try several things but everything they try backfires.The movie follows what they do and how things backfire. The plot might seem to be interesting but the movie has many flaws .Many scenes and part of plot seem to be missing from the movie ,but acting overall is good especially Rajpal Yadav.His expressions will certainly make you laugh.Priyadarshan seems to be directing many movies at a time and hence is not able to produce the same product as his earlier ones.FINAL VERDICT-Don't go to watch this movie just because a newspaper has given this a high rating.This might not be as funny to you as many have described.If you are a movie buff save your money for big budget movies to be released during the last 4 months of this y" 
" Fatigue of such films","Priyadarshan who turned a new leaf with Hera Pheri(2000) kept making comedies and slowly the formula started dieing out DHOL also has 4 heroes something similar to GOlmaal, Dhamaal.etc The film has nothing new just the same story and the same sort of comedy, escapades,The story borrows subplots from 1990 Malayalam film In Harihar Nagar written by Siddique-Lal The film perhaps is shot on a low budget. The film gets boring after a while, the drama and emotions too fail to cut ice, thrills are also thrown in but they too don't impress much, a few scenes are funny but few and far between The film seems never ending towards the end, after the fight at the petrol pump one expects it will end but it doesn't, we have a longdrawn chase wherein Murli Sharma goes to attack Payal Rohatgi and Tanushree Direction by Priyadarshan is nothing great Music is typical, the only song worth noting is Yeh Andera in the startAmongst actors, Rajpal Yadav does his usual monkeying around but yet does add some laughs, Sharman Joshi is the better of the lot but wasted in such a film, Tusshar Kapoor gets overbearing, Kunal Khemmu in his first comedy as adult is decent Tanushree Dutta with a dubbed voice is annoying, Payal Rohatgi is nothing great Arbaaz Khan leaves a mark in a cameo, Murli SHarma is okay Tiku Talsania is okay, Om Puri annoys, while Farida Dadi is okay late Rasika Joshi is funny, Asrani is as usual" 
" Epitome of pathetic comedy","Priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. That is what this man is known for, or rather, was known for. After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I can't recollect for now. Now with hideous films like Dhol, the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- 'torture'.Dhol is a mixture of bad, unfunny toilet jokes, somewhat of drama, poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny, though not witty, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma, the acting was decent. Speaking of the acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandma, firstly resembled a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.The plot was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. There is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. And at last, the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. The idea of having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour or so, you get exhausted and want to leave the theater. But being a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie. THe movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place.If your mother-in-law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything, then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10." 
" Kabhi Dhol Jyada Dumroo, don't need much talent to play both...","Another Priyadarshan/Vohra flick another movie that was seen for TP rather than actual desire, the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others), but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie.I was happy with the casting in general except, Rajpal Yadav who once again annoys to no limit, he does however extract some laughs, but these were those standard slapstick non-original jokes, in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol, I mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise, or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it?? Its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner, for an extended period who are considered great.Which brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo hardly requires any talent, it has no variations, and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the Dhol does.This movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played, sometimes the Dhol was played sometimes the dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly the Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like any 24 year old sooner than later I got bored.The movie has some good Dhol (good) moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying Dumroo (entertaining initially, then tolerable then irritating), the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you haven't watched it watch it on Filmy, it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny).This movie had its moments, the actors did a fine job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can act though, I've seen him in Main Meri Patni) who annoys more than entertains, I've said it many time and I'll say it again I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi-star comedies especially.Some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father, the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other.But after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added, this mean that once the girl was in, the following 45-60 mins was increasingly torturous, the climax was "SO BAD ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY", I mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable.The movie is also extremely predictable, there's hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here, its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag.The movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump, down or up, and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl.Most of the really bad scenes were towards the end, one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy, also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition, THE LAST 10-15 WAS ESPECIALLY DISTATEFULL AND COMPLETELY SPOILS THIS MOVIE.I didn't find Tanushree Datta quite the siren she was to play, and her acting talent is in serious question, especially in view of her non-appealing looks, if you cant be a HOT and cant act how much time can you survive.Technically also this movie was weak, with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera-work.The songs except the title track were no good either, when the songs played in the 2nd half I could feel the collective gasp from the audience.In all a movie that's just ordinary merely because of the cast, and the very low expectations.Avoiding it wont be a bad idea.And if it has to be watched watching it on TV for free or a very cheap matinée or something is a must, if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed.-s lots of stale jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINS AND LAST 15 MINS ESPECIALLY, bad technically, bad songs.+/-s tries to be more than what it was, not the regular cast (I'm happier for it), Tanushree Datta.+s some good scenes towards the beginning,title song, good acting and cast except RY.total 4.5/10 (I'm trying to be objective here, i don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations, so I'm giving it the benefit of all doubts, on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4)"
