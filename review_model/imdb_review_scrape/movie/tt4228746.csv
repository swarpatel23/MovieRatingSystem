" Don't watch if it is free also...","Story: Rohan Achrekar is a crime reporter with the daily who is nursing a broken heart. Estranged girlfriend Priya has stopped responding to him. He needs to move on and to initiate that he takes a home in the woods. Maya, the daughter of the landlord has an air of mystery to herself. She is positively smitten by him and can't get enough of him. Amidst all this, after a drunken night the two have an accident where Nancy is killed. Nancy is the younger sister of Priya. Maya and Rohan shush up on it and run away from the spot. Story leads to a series of mishaps and murders and Maya's obsession for Rohan keeps growing.Is jealousy leading her to murder those close to Rohan or is it all a botched up plan of Rohan and Priya to resolve permanently some old sibling rivalries?Performances: Manara is radiant to look at. Resembling Parineeti Chopra a lot in many ways, the actress misses the enthusiasm and expertise of her sisters. She needs a good deal more of experience before she attains the same.Karanvir is quite competent in comparison. Though his acting too can do with some polishing, the actor has done a decent job.Shradha Das in her minuscule role was good and shares quite a sparkling chemistry with Karan even if it hardly has any screen space.Mohan Kapoor is a veteran and though barely used he was great.Direction & screenplay: Vivek Agnihotri had found a fan in me with Buddha In A Traffic Jam but the filmmaker's stark disparities in the standard of films shock me. He is on extremes. Either he is bloody brilliant or when he is bad or mediocre, he is way below his caliber. I trust him to make a better film, but Zid was plain dumb. I understand the story isn't any genius but the director often structures the film such that it can run chills down your spine. The first point of put off is its depressing setting. Gloomy and raining; I stop to wonder does these stereotypes come with thrillers. The film is devoid of light and colors. The screenplay isn't fast enough for a thriller and the build up is more irritating than enticing. Once the climax was done, I bought the story giving it the benefit of being just another stereotypical thriller but the anticlimax left me so disappointed. It was anything but extraordinary, rather it left too many loose ends untied in the end. The music wasn't up to my taste and the film's end made me thank my stars for having the strength enough to survive it.The last word: Zid is not cringe worthy, just plain boring. Selling itself in the garb of a few explicit shots, the film's fabric did not back itself in a solid enough story. It doesn't have anything exemplary about it, not its acting, story or the chemistry between its lead pair. The worst thing about Zid was its climax that was downright silly. It's almost like a bunch of intelligent people thought of doing a crash course in making a silly film and Zid was made. I am going with a very kind Rating of 1/10." 
" A wasted opportunity","Zid is a thriller movie which tries to do something new.The story is very good and could have been adapted into a much better film.The screenplay of the movie is very sluggish and boring in 1st half.The story is about a crime reporter who has been dumped by his girlfriend.He changes his house to forget the pain of breakup.Their he meets the landlord's daughter,a sweet and mysterious girl.They fall in a hit and run case.Then how he proves his innocence and what happens next will blow your mind.The story was pretty good but contained some loopholes but its presentation is weak,especially in 1st half.The twist in the ending was not great but was very good.If they have paid a little attention then this movie had potential to become a great thriller.Last 30 mins of the movie was fast paced and saving grace of the movie. Acting of everyone was bad.Karanvir neither looked handsome nor acted well.Mannara was a total waste.Every supporting cast member overacted.Music was good.Dialogs were average.Direction was bad.Locations were good and pleasing. If you are a fan of thriller then you may like it.If you are able to bear its lousy 1st half and terrible acting then you may go for it.Overall it could have been better. 5.2 out of 10 is my rating." 
" Nice movie","It's a great movie and thrilled towards the end. ..its like fresh air in the stale films like hollyday. ...naam bada Darsham chhota. ..anubhaw sinha has worked nice and a wachable thriller. ..manaara kapoor was gud ...just some more gud songs may leads it to top grosser of bollywood box office. ..and some more romance a bit more strong dialogue and the plot of accident is not well crafted it should be a tale in the twist rather but over all nice movie a must watch ...In the era of khans it was gud to see fresh new faces I would like to give 8 out of 10 stars overall but if u watch a movie for music masala and songs it's not that kind but a gud thriller it prooves at the end.." 
" This rocket fails to launch","Interesting concept and as unbelievable a goof-up the ruins the film. The script had potential to change the way suspense thrillers are made around here, and the director and the lousy set of actors had the audacity to leave it as just another such B-Grade movie that is more about the skin show than story. Karanveer, the protagonist has a real lot to learn in terms of acting to every be judged by critics, he is perfectly capable all by himself to destroy the film with the lack of effort for performing. Shraddha Das was as ordinary and invisible as her role was, she lacked the punch to make her presence felt for the role allotted to her. Barbie Handa was the best thing to come out of this mess. She has potential, but not sure with all the unnecessary skin show she is taking the right path to stardom. The director seemed to be one who would say 'CUT' to any pathetic performance, his sense of continuity, his skills at detailing and overall the understanding that is required to direct a sensible thriller is clearly lacking. There are so many loopholes for such an interesting script that one ends up feeling bad for the story writ Wasn't this a twisted version of "THE CRUSH"(1993)? Songs were good, cinematography not as good. Sense was missing too!" 
" Don't do any 'Zid' to watch this.","There are certain films that need to be released despite being a bad product, just to get rid of them by their makers as they themselves clearly know about the mess but can do nothing about it quite helplessly. ZID is another of those ill-fated projects which though had a fairly interesting plot of becoming an engaging thriller but turns out to be so amateurishly presented and enacted film that one really feels annoyed thinking about the fact that it was supposedly the launch vehicle of another good looking girl from the Chopra family with an inspired foreign angle too.Loosely adapted from a German film, UNTER NACHBARN/THE GOOD NEIGHBOUR (2011) and re-scripted again with typical Bollywood kind of insertions, it's a perfect case wherein a fine plot gets ruined by the re-writers focusing more on erotica than the mystery element.ZID is the debut film of Mannara (earlier known with a different name), who is another cousin of Priyanka Chopra post Parineeti making her own reputed place in the industry. And it is said that the movie was approved by Priyanka only to go ahead. God knows what she saw in the project/script to recommend!Reportedly director Vivek Agnihotri prepared Mannara for her strange/difficult kind of role, completed more than half of the film and then walked away due to some undisclosed differences, which rightly explains its directionless proceedings post intermission like a lost wandering child.The film has more than 5-6 songs and a quite deliberate and at your face kind of skin show, probably added later to make it commercially viable catering a particular section of viewers in the smaller centers. However, surprisingly the songs are not that bad in comparison to many other big films but fail to make an impact along with an average cinematography and background score due to all mediocre & uninteresting sequences on the screen generating no interest whatsoever.In short, if you wish to learn how acting can be interpreted as screaming, emoting weirdly, showing cleavages, kissing wildly and more, then you should ideally see ZID, which is an excellent example of how even a suspense murder mystery can turn out to be so boring and irritating watch at times. Having a pretty confused script, strangely adapted from a foreign film with fine ratings, it simply tests the patience of the viewers and is strongly not recommended, particularly to the fans of this exciting genre. You would not be able to bear it for more than two hours." 
" Sexy, Sensual and Surprising!!","I had never expected such kind of a plot from this movie! I was left shocked towards the end, completely shocked! It is that surprising. I so wanted to give this flick a 10/10 but that's not possible due to a few loopholes that the plot has. Many instances in the movie are not explained in the climax. Rohan(Karanvir Sharma) is a crime journalist who goes to a outhouse to revive his life as it is suffering due to his breakup with Priya(Shraddha Das). There he meets Maya(Mannara), the landlord's daughter; and then begins a story of seduction, murder and deceit. I won't give away any further plot details as it will spoil all the fun. The movie is STUNNING! Book your tickets right away. It is not a mainstream Bollywood movie, it is a gripping thriller. Mannara(Maya) has done an excellent job, she is so cute I already have a crush on her :) Shraddha Das does fine in acting and excellent in the sensual scenes. Karanvir Sharma does an excellent job as the crime reporter. My vote - 8/10" 
" What a movie,forgettable,the songs still not forgettable!","The movie takes the grip to one's mind and diverts viewer's to think of different opinion and views,although it makes enough effort to become an erotic thriller,one still makes guess that something somewhere is incomplete,but still its going very smooth with great performances.The movie completely turns into a suspense after interval and one starts guessing about the possible outcomes but the outcome is way too obvious.The movie till the end becomes obvious enough to make one leave their seat and stop watching anymore of it.
Surprisingly,the movie climax is way too surprising and shocking which I think no viewer could even think and feel about while watching the whole movie." 
" What your're seeing it is'nt the truth","The Evil Wins. Maya is innocent. dont watch or you won't get those 2 hours back EVER....." 
" Awesome Movie","This is new era of movie generation in India. Excellent movie. Great ending. No one could have predicted the ending. Don't wanna disclose more. But if you enjoy Fight Club, Memento, The Prestige, Shawshank Redemption, The others, Sixth Sense and others, then you must watch this movie with full of twists and turns....Keeps you guessing....there are dull moments which are there in most bollywood movies....I loved this movie till the end...it kept my mind swirling around with my own guesses...but what an ending.....genius.....This movie is not for everyone but who loves suspense and darker side of the story, would love it......." 
" Great story but worst acting.","Story is about a crime reporter who is in love with his ex-girlfriend but there is another girl who is very obsessive for him. Basically, a cocktail of sex, suspense, and thriller. According to me, Storyline of the movie is very good, I mean, awesome climax (could be more elaborated but bus good anyway). Acting was very dull and we can even notice the weak direction. It could be made even better if the star cast would have chosen from good theaters. All over Zid is made to launch Mannara who can not do acting at all (as per this movie). Sensual scenes were good. Director knew the people's psychology about intimacy. There were some geographical errors and continuity was missing. My Ratings are as follows Acting and star cast: 2 SStory is about a crime reporter who is in love with his ex- girlfriend but there is another girl who is very obsessive for him.
