" Bluffnaster - Right Here Right Now !","Bluffmaster  Right Here, Right Now! Indian cinema finally comes of age! Actors living their parts, and not merely acting , the film maker who is not just telling a story but just portraying a honest , brutal reflection of our times. Instantly recognizable characterizations and everyday situations which one can relate to. Mind blowing performances and a directorial masterstroke! Chartering unexplored horizons, the movie has upped the standard for Bollywood forever.OK, that was the "Bluff "portion of the review! Bluffmaster is nothing close to what is written in the first paragraph. And the best part is it doesn't pretend or even attempt to be! That I guess is what makes Bluffmaster work! A movie where the maker and the actors don't take themselves too seriously and one in which they are having a blast and hoping that the audience would join them in doing so! Yeah, the plot is nothing earth shattering in itself. But the casting, performances, the dialogues (cant remember the last Hindi movie which had such witty one-liners), and the zany soundtrack with the remixes elevate the proceedings to a great extent.The obvious scene stealer in the movie is Nana Patekar. Often accused of being stereotypical with his penchant for mouthing heavy duty dialogues , Nana does a complete u  turn , with his over the top, narcissist portrayal of the " Chuna " factory don who no one ever dreams of messing up with .He gets the best lines in the movies ( his intro scene , when he denounces Priyanka and Abhishek , his lap top , why his image has taken a beating etc). You just need to watch "Apaharan " to put to rest any debate on this mans versatility .Booman Irani is the kind who makes even the most mundane role look interesting and delivers his part to the T. The surprise packet of the movie is Ritiesh D. Clowning comes almost naturally to him given his looks, but he handles it without going overboard or being loud. The good old adage of loud is funny is thrown out of the window and the escapades of duo (Abhishek and him) are truly funny.And yes Aby Baby delivers. It almost seems that entire nation has been waiting for Abhishek to work! In the last few movies (Yuva, Bunty, Sarkar) Abhishek evolution as an actor can be seen and in a mad cap movie like this he even brings a touch of vulnerability to his character. He emotes , cries , gets drunk , does the " Dus Bahane " dance step to perfection , sports a stubble, a swagger and wears an unbuttoned shirt to claim the title of the official " Cool Dude " ! Priyanka doesn't have nothing much to do and thankfully for that. Himman Dhamija captures Mumbai in all its splendor, the by lanes and the skyline lending itself to the screenplay. Further the technical finesse which is becoming more the norm in Bollywood movies today is pretty much evident.The movie does have its share of flaws -the romantic interludes drag on, caricaturist, simplistic con games and the utter detachment you may experience. Tongue in cheek, cocky and ultra cool, this spoofy caper deserves a watch! You know you are being taken for a ride, just sit back and enjoy it!" 
" A fun film with some good tunes which will get your feet tapping.","Roy Kapoor (Bachchan) is a career conman who excels in running the "perfect scam". He's in love with Simmi (Chopra) who he's been dating for 6 months and they're getting engaged. Unfortunately at their lavish engagement party, one of his most recent cons comes back to bite him on the proverbial when the victim turns out to be Simmi's uncle! Simmi had no idea her fiancé was a conman (she thought he was a stockbroker) and BOOM! The engagement is broken off and Simmi tells Roy that she wants nothing more to do with him. Six months later, a forlorn Roy still wanders around like a lovesick puppy and comes across Dittu (Deshmukh) another conman but rather new to the game who's pulling off a con with a doctor (Irani). Dittu and colleague drop a banger and Dittu grabs the doctor and he falls to the floor thinking he's been shot, Dittu calls an "ambulance" but in reality they're out to steal whatever they can from the doctor. Roy "rescues" the doctor and in return the doctor gives him some well meaning advice, and in the process they discover that Roy has a brain tumour and only has 3 months to live. Simmi gets engaged to another man, Dittu keeps hounding Roy to mentor him as he wants to be as good at conning people as Roy for been for so many years and he wants to avenge his father's downfall at the hands of another conman Chandru (Patekar), who is somewhat of a gangster too.The cons at the start and climax of the film were pretty brilliant and you really don't see the end one coming, so it is quite a surprise. I think it was very cleverly done but I'm guessing there's a Hollywood film out there with a similar storyline which has been copied because I'm pretty sure Bollywood didn't come up with this idea! If I'm doing Bollywood an injustice in that comment then I'd be the first to hold up my hand and admit I made a mistake.The film itself is reminiscent of the Michael Douglas starrer The Game but don't be fooled into thinking it's a direct copy... It isn't!All in all Bluffmaster gets a high 9 out of 10 from me. I'd recommend fans of comedy and/or con capers give this a watch. It's a slick fast-paced film with lots of eye candy for both the male and female audience with some good laughs thrown in along the way." 
" A rather interesting and comedic plot","If I am not mistaken, this is Rohan Sippy's second effort at film-making, and I must say it is not bad at all. The movie is slick, funny and yet remains within its theme. Powered by good performances from Abhishek Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, Ritesh Deshmukh, Boman Irani and Nana Patekar as well as a bunch of extras, the film stands out amongst the recent crime- thriller movies that all these new young directors are venturing into. The reason: It doesn't have style overpowering substance.That doesn't however mean that the movie doesn't ooze stylish and contemporary production values  but just that along with that is a story that keeps you gripped. Using the old school (but very effective) formula of a decent masala mix of action, comedy, drama, emotion and music, Sippy has devised a lovely recipe to keep the audience's interest  a recipe that more Indian directors and story-writers should stick to, since it works.About the movie a little bit. The story revolves around a conman, Roy (AB) who can pull off any con on any one. He has a girlfriend, played by Priyanka Chopra and at the beginning of the movie itself, he proposes to her. At the engagement party, however, one of the people he has conned is a guest and its not a surprise when everyone finds out his true identity and the engagement's off.In this terrible time, he runs into Dittu (RD), a small-time crook who tries to con Roy, but ends up in trouble himself. Through some convenient situation, they meet again, and Dittu ends up saving Roy's life. Now Roy owes him a favor and Dittu decides that he can become Roy's student in conman-ship and learn a few valuable lessons in crime. This is where the love-hate relationship begins. Added to that cast are Boman Irani, who plays a doctor (in the middle of the movie, Roy discovers that he has a brain tumor, and his time alive is limited), and Nana Patekar who plays an evil, narcissistic hotelier, with whom Dittu has an old refute to settle.The real hero of the movie is the script, however, written by Rajat Arora and it is kept at a smooth pace. The script does refer to Sholay every now and then (another Sippy production) as well as light inspirations from certain dialogs in Ocean's Eleven and Jerry Maguire (let's see if you can pick those!), but overall it's kept tight and entertaining.Although, at the end, the movie did seem somewhat "inspired" by Michael Douglas' "The Game", it had enough differences from the original, and in fact, in my opinion is a better movie. If you haven't watched "The Game" you could possibly enjoy this one better because then the end is a real surprise.Do go... it isn't a waste at all." 
" great watch!!","if u r looking for a nice lighthearted, young, and peppy movie with hip music, this is the one for u... basically out and out comedy with takes a different route halfway thru the movie but catches on with a bang with a twist in the end of the movie! every single frame is like a music video with catchy tunes and remixes!abhishek is well, just his funky self... contrary to popular belief nothing inherited from bunty n babli, ritesh is cute and very funny and priyanka is OK.. nana patekar has never done so well a comedy film (hey wait, i don't think he had any comedy movies before.. but now he should do more!) and the music is simply... hippy!! thank god the songs r not forcefully placed in between the movies but tastefully done with the whole retro theme of the movie.. not everyone can use this retro theme so well in their movies. I loved it..." 
" Story of an overconfident conman !","A conman to the core who loves taking lethal risks for the joyride and the money finds it difficult to mend his ways after his lover finds about his reality. A rookie thief who bumps into the con-master, begs him to teach him the tricks of the trade and becomes his sidekick. What follows then is fun, adventure and a dangerous mission. You have to pay special attention to the events, characters and their dialogs. This is because all things have unapparent significance. Bluffmaster is shot entirely in Mumbai and surprisingly makes it look good. Abhishek is definitely matured and Ritesh is good fun. Actress Priyanka looks great and acts just right, nothing overdone. A thriller with a cool attitude and good music that keeps you glued till the end. Smart one liners, good aesthetics, pacey storytelling make this an offbeat bollywood flick. If you like good movies , don't miss this one. And yes the end makes sense." 
" Abhishek Bachchan-Yeh Dil Maange More!","Bluff Master is a fantastic piece of cinema with just the right amount of emotions, drama, comedy, thrill and about Abhishek Bachchanyeh dil maange more! The star has finally become the actor with this film! When Abhishek started with his career, he seemed to have teething problems because of the mammoth surname attached to his name. Not only did his screen presence improved tremendously with each and every film, he has also let go off any inhibitions he might have suffered from when he began. If Yuva was the film, which brought him the critical acclaim and Bunty Aur Babli and Sarkar had moments where the son outshone the father, Bluff Master is definitely the film, where Abhishek comes of his own! Produced by Ramesh Sippy (Sholay, Seeta Aur Geeta, Shaan, Saagar, Shakti), Bluff Master is a brilliant piece of writing by Shridhar Raghavan, who is also credited with stories of films like Apharan and Khakee. The editing is razor edged by Amitabh Shukla and never loses its pace. Cinematography by Himman Dhamija is gripping and catches the right hues and colors of what is needed of a comic thriller like Bluff Master. Full marks to director Rohan Sippy (Debut-Dhai Akshar Prem Ke) for his dedication, passion and focus to make a product, which is not just good in few areas but excels in totality. Sippy's hard work shows in not letting the structure of the story fall apart like a pack of cards like the film made on a similar subject- Bunty Aur Babli. The plot is interesting and the climax keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing. The audio cd of the film may not be a collector's item but songs go well as audio- visual pieces choreographed with much punch and fervor in the film. The rap song ' Right Here Right Now' sung by Abhishek Bachchan rocks! The background score does justice to the screenplay. The costumes are carefully designed keeping the profile of each character. Talking of characters, the writer seems to have put extra time and efforts in shaping the characters, whether primary or secondary. The film has quite a few interesting con jobs, which do not strike as odd and on the contrary lends realism to the film and an instant identification with its characters. The dialogues are not rhetoric, and carefully mouthed, again to affirm the honesty with which the film is made. Associating people from different classes with different types of fish was refreshing and innovative work in dialogue writing. There is no unnecessary brooding over Roy (Abhishek) who is a professional at bluffing people as to why and what circumstances led him to join this line, neither does he let himself go ballistic over a vainglory accomplishment he achieves as a bluff master. There is a thin line between a con artist and a bluff master. Roy is a cool dude Bluff Master, lives in a swanky apartment and drives a chic car. Actors Ritesh Deshmukh, Boman Irani, Nana Patekar and Priyanka Chopra did full justice with their roles. The film is well crafted, and distinguishes itself from a buffoonery or slapstick, and is rather a sensible comedy that provides a much- needed comic relief, after absolute nonsense and trash films like Shaadi No. 1, Garam Masala and Home Delivery. Story: Roy (Abhishek Bachchan) is a professional conman, who has raised his work to the level of an art. He loves Simmi (Priyanka Chopra) who is unaware of his dark side. When his past catches up with him, she cannot forgive him for the deceit their relationship is built on and dumps him. That's when Dittu (Ritesh Deshmukh) enters his life. Dittu takes Roy as his mentor and wants to learn the tricks of the trade from him. As circumstances take turn, Roy must do one single most important thing in his life, which is to help Dittu get revenge from Chandru (Nana Patekar). What happens when the Bluff Master who wears so many masks is left with no alternative but to take them all off and finally reveal his real self? Watch Bluff Master to find out!" 
" Abhishek Bachhan has come into his own","Bluffmaster is a delightful movie. The dialogues are crisp and far above average from Hindi film sentimentality. Abhishek Bachhan is a natural and I do believe that he is a far better actor than his very popular father. His Hindustani diction is leaps and bounds better than all the Khans combined. Nana Patekar is at his comic best as his sinister character belies the poet at heart. I was able to tolerate Priyanka Chopra in this movie, far better than the Barbie character she plays in Krrish. Boman Irani is funny. I do believe that much of the film is a mish-mash of lifts from western films of the genre and even some of the dialogues are plagiarized. But the Hindustani play on metaphors and aphorisms is what makes this movie so very fun to watch. The English subtitles do little justice to the rich dialogue in Hindustani.The songs are a wonderful blend of Hinglish." 
" A take on a Hollywood film not watched by many Indians","If you have liked Bluffmaster for its "different storyline" heme... this movie is based on a Hollywood film called 'The Game.' In fact I feel the reason why the movie is called Bluffmaster is not Abhisheks profession in the film, but bcos of the movie itself. You will know what I mean once you see it for yourself. overall the movie is good. It is entertaining, and the dialougues, script and screenplay is good. The characters too have been developed well. The one thing about the film which struck me is its international look. Not only does it have a different style of editing (like the cuts, the fade-outs or the character introductions) but also the songs are mostly Jay-Z-ish. Unnecessary songs, but good nonetheless. Watch it if you are looking for a movie to pass your time. It will leave you feeling good, mainly because everything turns out just fine..." 
" Bluffmaster","Bluffmaster is one of the popcorn entertainers of the year with fun fast 2 hours, fine performances and of course its unique MUSIC. I did enjoy it than any other comedies last year except No entry which was also hilarious. What makes it different is it handled every aspect with equal importance. Whether it is Drama, Comedy, Music or of course Love. Surprisingly what I loved most after its Music is its Luv Estory Part. There is a scene when Roy (Abhishek) telling Sim (Priyanka- Hot in 'Come to me' number) about love affairs "Biggest lie in this world is  I LOVE U- Jaise Time Bitata Hai LOVE Nikal Jaata Hai and only left behind is I n U". Then she argues over this as on same basis when Roy proposed her with same line if it was a lie. Watch Abhishek's response- 'Vo such tha Sim. 'Vahi To Ek Sach Tha'. This is my favorite scene in movie.As title suggests Roy(Abhishek) is bluffmaster looting (fishing in his language) and after making good money retired from the line and planning to settle with his girl-friend Sim(Priyanka). Which didn't work out as on engagement one of his tricked one shows up and leading to heart-break of Sim and blah blah. Roy is now longing for Sim making every possible effort to make her believe that he is changed. There is a very nice scene when he is sitting in the restaurant, ordering coffee after coffee that eventually persuades Sim to talk to him but she refuse to forgive him at any cost.We meet various characters- Dittu(Ritesh) who is now getting trained by Roy as a favor- Now kahani me so called twist is Dr. Bhalerao (Boman) diagnosed Roy is suffering from some last stage Brain Tumor. He has only three months. Boman gives theory of life where he explains how we live for 30 years but Only 30 were memorable? So make these 90 days memorable and live for another 90 years kinda. Valid indeed. End of first half we are introduced to Chandu (Nana Patekar). Dittu is seeking revenge from Chandu and it can be possible only if Roy help him out. Well, Climax turns everything upside down but I find it is well come surprise ending.On Downside it fails to keep high on certain sequences but not too long.Talk about its Music-It is awesome- One of the best varied collections of songs the year. Both Original and Remixes are like hitting bull's-eye. Fantastically choreographed Right Here Right Now I can watch hundreds of times for sure. Same is with 'Bure Bure'. Both have topped pub and disco DJ lists to get crowd wild.Bluffmaster wouldn't be same if casting would have been different and who is irreplaceable in all is Nana Patekar. He portrayed such a flamboyant character stealing scene after scene with cheesy one-liners. Favorite is "IMAGE!!!" and "Kis Liye? Picture Bahot Acchi Chal Rahi Hai..Parade Pe Fekane Hai". Nana is utilized here 100 % as Nana and dialogs have developed a vada-paav kinda relation. He is offered very best lines here and his colorful character never misses a bit. Rithesh, Boman and Priyanka made a well supporting cast. And Abhishek Bacchan who is getting better and better with every outing. Check out how cool he is in 'Right Here Right Now' number. Same in rain drunk scene, in Sim's Coffee shop scene.Honestly I went this movie with no expectation but left hall Ekdum Paisav Vasool." 
" True romance relived-Celebrate Bollywood!!","Mumbaicut to the size of the silver screen, an assortment of picture postcard shots, a lively score, and an able characterization is what makes this one of the most outstanding products this year. Oh ya, I know you are gonna say I missed the story. But frankly dear, I don't give a damn! All I know is that when I go see a movie, I should see the effort and the mindset and vision of the director right there on the huge screen in front of me, nothing else matters. From the first frame to the last, the movie exudes style, and not self-righteous style, an ingrained effortless style. I was in for this fare anyways even it would have been bad, but I was pleasantly surprised by the narrative, its more of a celebration of bollywood for me, bollywood of the seventies-the numerous references to the cinema of the yore celebrated in a universal way, which is so pleasing to the eyes the heart and the mind. A protagonist with multi-layered character, an able-skilled assistant, a merciless love interest and a lovable villain makes up this joyride-roller-coaster of a bolly-revelation-magic." 
" Entertaining","It's a gripping movie which doesn't let you leave your seat. I would highly recommend this to everyone." 
" Decent Con film","In the year 2005, there were many con films like the crap though hit Bunty Aur Babli, Chocolate, Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena which didn't work and finally BLUFFMASTER.The film again had AB Jr again play a conman just like B & B. The film however is much more realistic(in comparison to B & B), it starts off well with a sort of tribute to Amitabh's DO AUR DO PAANCH type films. The romance is well handled, Also the con acts are well handled here, maybe discounting a few. The turn of events after Nana's entry are well handled though the climax doesn't register that well, though it's well handled but leaves plenty of flawsDirection by Rohan Sippy is good Music is good, There used plenty of songs for background music including Amitabh's DO AUR DO PAANCh title song,Arush's Boro Boro is good, while Sabse Bada Rupaiya is good too, Abhishek's debut song Ek Main fits well and is decent Camera-work is superb, Mumbai never looked so beautiful Abhishek Bachchan is excellent in a role, unlike B & B here he plays it more naturally and seems ideal for the part, though at times too serious perhaps Ritiesh is simply superb as Dittu, he endears himself and makes his act look likable Priyanka Chopra is decent, Nana Patekar steals the show as Chandrakant Parekh, he as always makes you laugh even with a straight face Boman Irani is underutilised but decent, Tinnu Anand and others lend good support" 
" Best Hindi movie ever","This is beyond doubt best Hindi movie I have seen. The story is fast and there are no prolonged emotional / crying scenes. It actually has a story / plot which is rare. Actors have all acted well and dialogs are good. From starting till end movie has been carried well and songs are also nice. The movie is also decent and can be watched with friends and family without feel awkward. The movie also teaches some very important lessons about life and eventually leaves the viewer happy and satisfied. I hope the readers of this review like the movie as much as I did." 
" Better than the average Bollywood movie.","The reviewers who claim this to be "exact copy" of Nueve reinas (Nine Queens) most certainly could not be making this claim if they had seen BOTH movies. There are some remote similarities with regard to a few aspects of the movie, but this is NOT an exact copy of any Hollywood or South American film. Overall it is a decent movie. Not the usual boring Bollywood melodrama or romantic comedy that are dime a dozen. However, it is a bit too slow at times and some scenes the movie could have done without (mostly the early Bhalerao scenes) and the sequences where Roy goes after Simmi attempting to make up with her. The soundtrack was weak except for "Ek mein aur ek tu hai..". Performances were okay, slightly below par. Overall the script is not focused, it tried to do too many things. Movie would be much more effective if it picked one track and stayed on it." 
" One of Abhishek's best performances","Bluffmaster is one unique masterpiece. When you think about it, it's a masala film. When you analyze it, it's not a typical masala film. It's nice blend of action, suspense, comedy and drama.Abhishek Bachchan is the star of the movie. Most of his roles are usually the supporting one and he is usually overshadowed by the Roshans, Khans & Big B. It is very nice to see him as the hero of the movie. He played "Roy" with utmost sincerity & tons of attitude. He suits the role very well, from the looks & everything else in between.Priyanka Chopra's character blended very well in the story. Most heroines in Bollywood are just a "decoration" to the movies, but Simmi's character begs to differ. Her character is not a Barbie doll, rather, her role is very logical & refreshing compared to others. Nice performance, indeed.Ritesh Desmukh has a nice timing for comedy. He knows when to make the joke. And he's also good at the dramatic scenes in the movie.Boman Irani plays his character very well. 50% serious & 50% funny best describes his character here. It is challenging to portray and I can say that played the role very well.Nana Patekar is the show-stealer. Good transition from the bad & dangerous gang leader to the tree-staying guy. He's very convincing as a villain and I can say he's really cool.Costumes - Love it. Very urban and modern.Dialogue - This movie has the wittiest lines in the history of Bollywood.Songs - The songs fit the movie well, which is very urban (and I'm a big urban music fan).All in all, 9/10" 
" Loved it!!!!","i have no idea which Hollywood movie gave the inspiration to this wonderful movie but I'm glad that i am not aware coz i enjoyed this movie wholeheartedly. The performances of the actors are very good.Abhi has proved further that he rocks in cool roles.... if he chooses roles like these more often he'll definitely be a legend...Priyanka she was good and she complemented her character quite well...Ritesh is just no questions put... very good performance and he definitely is getting better and better in his movies...Boman Irani is just an evergreen comedian... just looking at him gives me the chuckles... very cool and very funny man i just love him.. groundbreaking performance once again.Last but not the least Nanaji.... they say he is very stereotypical when it comes to his acting... i don't care... here he was very good and as the bad guy he delivered very good...The plot is good and the speed was perfect in the beginning kinda got faster in the middle but retained the suitable speed in the end...very good one-liners and definitely try to catch them... they provide a great comic relief...very good script... i loved the lecture of irani to bacchan bout the memorable days in your life very spirit lifting....overall a very good film and i have watched very few bollywood films recently that made me want to give a standing ovation... (seriously)"
