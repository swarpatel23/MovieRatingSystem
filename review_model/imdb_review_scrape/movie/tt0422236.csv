" Chameleon effect","This movie is one of the most chameleon-like I have ever experienced. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it; but the mainly relaxed, whimsical, romantic opening (after the first encounter with the crime boss, who almost then seems to get forgotten for about 40 minutes, though you know he must resurface sometime) is filled with extravagant Bollywood dancing (though often with a more sexy feel than I have usually encountered in my so-far limited Bollywood experience) and over-played but highly amusing protestations of love on the part of the main character, Jai. In this portion, the aficianado of Bollywood ladies has plenty of opportunity to admire the very sexy Kim Sharma as Jai's childhood friend Sonia, and also of course his new love Neha played by Kareena Kapoor, who is more restrained in her sexiness but just demurely lovely. But after about 30-40 minutes, the pace and tone completely changes with one dramatic moment, and after that we are very much engaged in a helter-skelter action movie with multitude plot twists, wide-ranging shifts of location from India to Dubai to South Africa and even (I think) a small vignette in London, and a fair share of unarmed combat and exploding gunshot wounds. This is not a movie for the faint-hearted or the lover of simple romantic Bollywood stories, but overall it is an enjoyable ride!" 
" Whats missing?","The movie may not be a masterpiece. But it is very good and not your regular run to the mill stuff. Flying story is that a guy falls in love with a girl who in fact is double crossing him. Her real boyfriend sets up this guy in a high profile internet bank robbery case which he has committed and gets the girl and the money while the guy somehow escapes police & the mafia don to hit back at the couple. If someone wants to learn about how technically a film is to be made just look at this movie. Every technical area whether photography, cinematography, sound, direction, choreography etc. just oozes class.Shahid Kapur as lead actor impresses to the hilt. He is the new star icon on the Hindi( just don't call it Bollywood please) movie horizon after Hrithik Roshan and sure would go a long way. His cute innocence impresses the audience and specially teen girls I guess :-). It is the first time that I have liked Kareena & Fardeen too. Kareena really looks good & Fardeen shows an impressive personality. People might say the movie story resembles Humraaz. But still the screenplay is racy and fully engrossing even if you guess the story. The direction by Ken Ghosh is the best. The guy is so exacting in his job that he has edited down the movie to mere 2 hours(rare in Hindi movies) and the results show - there is not even a single moment in the movie when you feel bored or look the other way. Great work Ken!!!Music is really good but "Nazar Nazar" stands out, the other songs are just as melodious. And they have been shot really tastefully, very much expected as director Ken Ghosh was a music video director before he ventured into the movies and the class shows. All in all both Shahid Kapur and Ken Ghosh impress after their earlier hit movie "Ishq Vishq". The movie is total entertainment and full value of money. I guess a lot of people find a lot of problems in the movie, to them I would say rather than finding pointless mistakes try appreciating something once a while. Definite watching advised." 
" Not crazy about this film","Watched Fida without any particular expectations and was not surprised by anything in it. This is an ordinary fare at best which is worth a one-time watch. The story is full of clich√©s, such as unconditional love and how a loving guy would give his life for a girl, how he gets accused for no fault of his own because of her and so on. Ken Ghosh's direction is nothing great. The script does not add much and at points it is ridiculous. After the so-called twist through which the truth is revealed, the film turns into a thriller but this part is heavily flawed and unconvincing, though it does have some entertainment value and suspense. The film's main protagonist is played by the very young Shahid Kapur, and the guy evidently tries very hard to do the best of what he was given. Although in terms of acting he was not there yet (as he is today with such performances as Kaminey), you can't but appreciate his efforts. Kareena Kapoor plays the bad girl probably because she noticed it was a trend for leading ladies to play negative roles. This role is sort of a take off on the many roles played by Bette Davis, but Kareena does a forgettable job. That's not entirely her fault because her role was not well written. Fardeen Khan is bad as the bad guy. The music of Fida does not stand out but I liked "Nazar Nazar" a lot as it was melodious, and I enjoyed "Maine Jisko Chaha" to an extent. Otherwise the film is simply better to avoid, with the ending being particularly pathetic. Do not expect much from Fida." 
" Disappointment","The subject of the film was very interesting, but the film wasn't treated well enough. I felt that the main twist when Shahid finds out that he has been betrayed was unfolded too soon in the storyline. And after that the film dragged up to the climax. Even the climax was not as 'shocking' as it was made out to be. The ending is not satisfying, it seems abrupt. For the exception of Kareena (who was awesome) no other actor delivered a great performance. Shahid was fine in the first half, but he seemed completely lost in the second half. And what was the reason for him to imitate Amitabh Bachchan in the finale (I wonder if anybody else noticed that). Fardeen was just about okay, he played the role of the suave Vikram nicely. This is Kareena's best performance to date. She looks gorgeous and makes a great looking pair with Shahid. The actor who played the don was horrible. He hammed throughout the film. The songs are good specially Maine Jisko Chaha and Aja ve mahi. Cinematography is fantastic. The film wears a posh and classy look throughout. Fida doesn't live up to my expectations 7/10." 
" Different fare","The tagline of this movie is aptly kept: "Not all love stories have the perfect ending." The opening scene is interesting with an Internet hacker transferring a gargantuan sum of money from a underworld don's bank account to a Swiss bank account. The innocent, naive Shahid Kapoor falls in love at first sight with Kareena. At first, the film seems very melodramatic and filmi, but that is later understandable after a startling fact is revealed. Fardeen was decent, and Kareena was good. Shahid's performance was amazing.We've already seen that he's an awesome dancer; he's an even better actor now. He's definitely going to go places. Songs are good, especially "Aaja Ve Mahi" and "Maine Jisko Chaha." The story is very different. It's a good story, but it's not very entertaining. This movie is a drama basically, and the different ending leaves you with the feeling of a Hollywood film." 
" Fizzles!!!","Ken Ghosh & Shahid Kapur hit the lime-light with Ishq-Vishk. The eyes of the industry were eagerly awaited on their next venture namely Fida.The director's intentions I am sure was to do away with the usual Bollywood masala of boy-meets-girl romance kinds. The theme was indeed innovative and had definite potential but.... yes BUT sadly the director did not hold the reigns well. Shahid-Kareena love story moves like a knight on the chessboard. The suicide attempt of Shahid depicted is quite amateurish for a serious theme like this. Plot opens up quite quickly and the rest is cat-and-mouse game. From a chocolaty boy Shahid rapidly transforms into SRK of Darr managing to survive every time - strange!!! Last but the not the least - the villain who is supposed to be a don was nothing short of an utter rubbish cartoon character mouthing Hindi dialogues with worst ever South Indian accent. Bottomline: no effort was made to develop the characters.Saving grace: stylish Fardeen..... suits his role well. The song pictured on Kareena-Fardeen lingers for a while, the others make a rapid evaporation.Ken - you can do better than this!" 
" Satisfactory","The opening with the hacking transaction being made is very classy and adds an air to the movie which sets a lingering tone throughout. However you have to wonder where its all going when after meeting this Neha, Jai begins to feel such strong emotions that it becomes sickening and as evident dangerous. I was caught by surprise when after all the happiness and declarations of absolute love Jai decided to self-harm for a naturally un-interested Neha! Wouldn't any normal woman naturally repel and remove herself from the situation? A man you have only known for a matter of days is already cutting himself to pieces in your name just to show you that he can! NO THANKYOU! You may thing I am just dismissing it but I think it was probably the most cruel act in this gritty plot as Jai put his utmost trust in this woman, little he knew...Nazar Nazar: Song number 1 in the visuals is a soft breezy track with mellow vocals that leaves you feeling its just another safe and pretty Hindi Cinema story especially after the first four lines...Aaja Ve Mahi: A very well put together number which is able to have you up on your feet at the first counts of the bass. Well choreographed, charming visuals and good chemistry. Slightly sickly.Dil Mere Na: What can i say. Enough sweet to kill a baby. However the outfits in this light-hearted number are easy on the eye. Cultured and colourful. The locations are a wonder as the input into the story is no-existent but the visuals are delightful.Maine Jisko Chaha: Raunchy, wild and (as you'll see in the opening of the song) wet! However do not get impressions that this is a song full of sleaze! It contributes majorly the film and just about explains everything after the cash transactions. We see a new sexy side to this heartless Kareena and Fardeen Khan is quite the designer dandy! Everything is thrown in for good measure Champagne to Showgirls! Sleek and sinful!by Khamisi Brown" 
" Fiddle-me-thumbs!","An account belonging to a major underworld don has been hacked into, and has been totally wiped out (around 220 crores!). Cops, media, and the said don all are very upset. [Scene change] Boy (Shahid Kapur - new promising kid on the block) sees girl (Kareena Kapoor). Boy goes ga-ga over girl! Boy convinces girl she is the girl of his dreams. Girl embraces boy. Boy starts singing/dancing etc. After much songs - story goes for a twist. Girl has financial problems (around 6 crores worth). Boy decides to rob a bank. Boy goes to the bank, sees another dude (Fardeen Khan) withdrawing a huge amount from the bank (around 7 crores - how convenient!). Boy decides to steal from the dude. And so the twists pile up on twists with a final twist at the climax!Sounds thrilling? It cudda been!The best part about Fida is that it clocks in at an amazing 2 hours and some change (and the songs are easy on the ears too). But the proceedings tend to disappoint every time you think the excitement level is going to notch up a little. Pacing is uneven, and the performances are inconsistent. Shahid Kapur has good screen presence and is a hit with the ladies, but his future strictly depends on his shrugging off the SRK hangover. Kareena Kapoor and Fardeen Khan are just OK. Make no mistakes - this is a director's vehicle, and Ken Ghosh seems to have lost his enthusiasm for the project somewhere after the first few reels." 
" Too unrealistic and stupid!","I watched this movie on a boring rainy afternoon and thought it would be a nice and light romantic flick.. It starts out with some guy trying to hack into a bank and then suddenly shifts to this mushy and really lame one-sided love story. There's a guy called Jai who has a gorgeous and perfect friend (Kim) but ignores her and falls for some random girl just because he sees her on the street and then he starts stalking her and acts like a guy crazy in love (whatever happened to falling in love after getting to know the person... this guy doesn't even know this chick!)... so he tries to kill himself over her and guess what? It works.. he doesn't die because of the suicide attempt and the girl decides to him a chance.The movie then has many twists and turns. Forget them in the end this sweet lover boy turns into psycho killer and chases the girl who betrayed him.Anyway, the only person who impressed me was Fardeen. I don't know what the movie makers wanted to show, but to me his character was just a smart, handsome and lovely guy who loved his girlfriend so much that he could do anything for her. On the other hand Shahid's character was completely unconvincingly and its difficult to believe that this little lover boy survives everything from suicide to police to falling off buildings.This movie is too dumb for people who use their logic. Characters are portrayed poorly and the movie ends making you go "huh?"" 
" Fida over....","Computer Hacker, Vikram, frames Jai Malhotra for this crime, and has him arrested, on condition that he will pay him 60 million rupees to pay for, Neha, his girlfriend's debts, to which Jai agrees. The bank account that was hacked is that of Babu Anna, a notorious Bombay criminal Don, who is engaged at this upstart for robbing him. He arranges to kill Jai when he is escorted to Court to be tried, but Jai manages to escape, only to find out that it was not only Vikram who framed him, but Neha also. This devastates Jai, and now he must run, not only from the police, but also Babu Anna's men, as well as his own memories.Jai (Shaheed Kapur) knows what kind of girl she wants to fall in love with. So it is but natural for him to fall in for Neha (Kareena Kapoor) when he meets her. He can do anything for Neha. But does Neha things that way too? He thinks there's is a perfect Mills and Boon Love story, but then life is not always that smooth. He has got something else in his fate.Vikram (Fardeen Khan) is a computer hacker who has hacked a bank account and transferred a lot of money to his account. He is looking for someone who can play the thief and surrender to the police as the thief. So what does Jai & Vikram have in common? Neha of course. Neha is in love with Vikram who pretends to be in love with Jai so that he could be framed in the bank robbery and they can live in peace. Then there is this Don whose money is stolen by Vikram. What will happen when Jai will know that Neha along with Vikram have framed him for the robbery? Will he take revenge? Or will he surrender to the Police and go to jail?" 
" quite good","i finally got the chance to watch this movie, from start to finish, n despite reviews i thought it was pretty good, but obviously it didn't do too well in India i couldn't understand why, i suppose the Indian public don't like anything outside its usual love stories. But back to fida, its an interesting love/hate story first half sets the mood but all the action is in the second half as fardeen khan makes his entrance. Overall i would recommend watching this movie an interesting one timer, the pace is never disrupted either, not even by the songs which i have to mention are good but il let everyone find out the 2 and a half hour way.Enjoy!!" 
" An awful story; a forgettable film......",""Fida" deals with a twisty tale of a love at first sight, betrayal, and obsession; but none of the things come strongly in the film due to a very poorly written story. The characters are totally unlovable and you don't remember what went by when you leave your seats. Shahid Kapoor remains a total miscast for his role. The roles of Kareena Kapoor and Fardeen Khan were one of the most amoral and unlovable ones. Just like a junk food culture, what you have are few melodious song numbers, and a bit of glamor which you won't remember for very long. By the end, you just leave with a feeling "what a mess I just watched." Just a cool advice, avoid this film and watch it only if you have nothing important to do.Rating: 1 star out of 4" 
" Fine and odd","The movie so called "Fida" is worth watching only once. Nothing new... Well.. it starrs SHAHID KAPOOR, KAREENA, FARDEEN KHAN, etc. The chemistry between Kareena and Shahid is good. Well.. now for an individual description:SHAHID: A character named "Jai". I don't know what makes him mad after Neha (Kareena) and what was the need to kill himself for her. Its really "baseless". First of all you fall in love with a girl whom you don't know and wanna commit suicide as you don't get her.KAREENA AND FARDEEN: Kareena as Neha and Fardeen as Vikram. The plot a plan to cheat Jai and declare in front of the police that Jai is the computer hacker and not Vikram (actually Vikram was the hacker). Jai did this as he loved Neha and they were in need of a lot of money. (A false play by Neha). Well.. the usual fight goes on between both Jai AND Neha, Vikram as Jai wants his life back who ran from the police.. I don't understand one thing... How come Jai who was shown to be "killed" a number of times in the movie makes a comeback again and again. eg: He is shown to have got shot by the police in a train and after 2 months he returns.. What an odd concept..Nothing new in the movie.. The usual "Ajnabee" concept. For me its a "FAILURE". The songs are very boring and the story goes slow with somewhat scary scenes. Very boring and lack of focus.Now the individual ratings: (Out of 5)Shahid: * * 1/2Kareena: *Fardeen: * *Overall acting: * * 1/2Direction: * * *Story: * * 1/2Music: * *Final Rating: * * * * 1/2 My rating: 4.5/10" 
" I have a problem seeing Kareena Kapoor as...","the drop dead gorgeous figure who sweeps men off their feet with her beauty, and drives a man to want to commit suicide over her. Um, okay it might look good on the page of a script but does not translate well on the screen when people like Kareena portray it. What ever happened to the likes of Diya Mirza, Aishwarya, Preity Zinta and others, heck! I would have even settled for Rani or Esha Deol! Kareena just killed it for me. I saw her in that role of the DDG siren and I just couldn't suspend my disbelief long enough to follow the rest of the plot. Something about an internet bank heist and the stupid guy who falls in love with her takes the fall even while being innocent. Come on now Bollywood! You had a good script but the casting department should have seen better than Kareena Kapoor, or wait, did she use her famous surname to get this role too? Now why doesn't that surprise me. No Fida for me please!" 
" Ken Ghosh Copied the story","Ken Ghosh has copied the story of Fida from a British film "Following" (1998) Director by the great Christopher Nolan, same guy who made Memento (2000) , Inception (2010). He has changed the story by 10 % actually Indian zed it and but his mark on this. He has also credited himself as the writer of the story, how can people just copy and call the film their. I suggest u guys watch the original film "Following" (1998) you will really like it. The following is shot in B/W its made in 1998 and he could easily make the film in color but chose to shoot the same in B/W, as but you don't really need color as I feel the story is more important then the visual effects. The film is simple and you can feel the master filmmaker in the making I only have line for Fida director ¬Ö. And Mr Ken Ghosh u r sick" 
" Crap","After ISHQ VISHQ success in 2003 Ken Ghosh returned with Shahid with a Abbas mustan type thriller FIDAThis is the first time that time Real life couple Shahid and Kareena were in a movie together and first time Kareena played a negative roleThe first half of the film is damn boring, everything is done to death the twist when Shahid agrees to rob a bank and the interval point is well handled but then the film gets even worst The game of one man upmanship is treated so badly and the film gets bad and bad and the climax too is too childishDirection by Ken Ghosh is a letdown Music is goodAmongst actors Shahid tries hard, in the initial reels where he plays a romantic lover he is okay but when his role gets serious he gets better but he hams it up towards the end especially in the end he apes Amitabh Bachchan and also in parts of 2nd half he apes SRK which he mostly did those days Kareena excels in her negative role Fardeen Khan too is good in his small role Amongst rest Akhilendra Mishra is crap kim Sharma is okay"
