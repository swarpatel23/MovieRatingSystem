" one of the best horror movies in India","if you think raaz and bhoot and bhool bhulaiya were good.. you must watch 1920 to see what is fantastic! the direction is excellent. 1920 is a cinematic treat!its definitely the best horror movie made in India. the lead actress Adah Sharma is brilliant beyond words. watch the movie for a lesson on acting.the first half of the movie you wont be able to predict what she is capable of doing in the second half!her sheer strength and change of expression(the scene where she laughs and cries and laughs again is eerie) i didn't sleep for nights. also the makeup is phenomenal(the black possessed lenses and the cuts and bruises on her face)the piano piece is haunting. i don't want to give the story away at all.but the entire film rests on the very strong shoulders of the lead actress who is the hero of the film. she is vulnerable, shes wicked, shes adorable and terrifying.and her beauty dates back to the 1920's.the events that take place after intermission keep you glued to your seat.1920 is a television favourite. plays on at least once a week.but try watching it on DVD as the scary scenes are deleted on TV." 
" I never knew Indian Horror could actually make sense","I love this movie for its simplicity and realism; something which Indian cinema blatantly exaggerates. A friend had mentioned this movie was good when it had hit the theaters in 2008, and now in 2012 I'm sad that I missed it. Thank God I was able to get my hands on a DVD. While the movie is not so great on the chills and effects, whatever it does do - it does do brilliantly well. Even the songs in the movie were well handled. I rarely every review movies, but this time I was compelled to. The same way I was compelled to write my first review after watching 'The Stoneman Murders'. I can't think of any movies that this one has been ripped off from; something which has plagued Bollywood since its inception. I will treasure this movie, which has once again resurrected my hope that not everything that comes out of India is copied and over-the-top.Just found out that there is a sequel too... well hey, everyone wants to make an easy buck and I know best to stay away from that one." 
" One of the best Bollywood horror movies","To be honest I wasn't having much expectations from 1920, as the cast was new and the songs were bad. But I was wrong. 1920 is a well-directed and well-written horror movie that has a terrific story line and dialogues. The first scene sets the tone and there are hardly any dull moments in the film except for the songs. Vikram Bhatt (director) did a fantastic job and the performances from the lead and supporting actors are fabulous. It is really one of the best horror flicks produced by Bollywood. You must watch it if you like no-nonsense horror movies with a great story and performances. Adah Sharma's performance was superb, Rajneesh Duggal was good, Raj Zutshi and other supporting actors did their job well. 8/10 from me." 
" A typical horror flick","A typical horror movie composed of all the elements--eerie winds and big empty bungalows, darkness and candles, mirrors cracking and moaning sounds, possession and exorcism, love and lust, betrayal and revenge-- you name it and you get it. Set in 1920, it has tremendous similarities to The Exorcist. Though it failed to scare me, it was an okay watch despite the rather funny ending, where both Christianity and Hinduism were used to exorcise the evil spirit. Adah Sharma acted well, though the completely non-glamorous white maxi gown she wore all the time actually became an eyesore."

" One of the best made Indian Horror Movie","In a country like India, where the genre of horror movies started from the likes of Madhumati and Mahal, to the Ramsay Brothers till the Bhatts, there has only been a downfall, with Bhoot, by Ram Gopal Verma being the only exception.1920, is a movie which is brilliant, but somehow did not get its due applaud and recognition. Right from the starting scene, where the actor is humming Hanuman Chalisa to the end moments of the movie, its completely gripping. There is no typical exaggeration, stupid make up, a predictable plot or wasteful songs.The cinematography of the movie, the Victorian era feel, the cultural conflict, the steady romance, some pretty good acting and finally a well directed movie by Vikram Bhatt does the trick.The best part which makes 1920, the Best Indian Horror Movie of the last 5 decades is the fact at it is not stereotypical. It has been very well edited. No special effects have been used just to "create" a horror feel, the plot and flow is such that you can actually feel the horror." 
" Impressive flick","Despite of all those saddened and painstaking negative reviews the people have given, one cannot disagree to the fact that this is one of the best Indian horror genre scripts till date. A say this mainly because of a strong and impressive story-line that keeps you interested throughout the film. Camera work are screenplay are good with a grand background score." 
" Not that Good.But not that bad Either.","Now,this movie cannot be called as something scary and full of twists and turns, but its a mix of Hollywood movies-THE EXORCIST and Bollywood-KARZ and add to that some patriotism.1920 is a fusion movie-bring bollywood and Hollywood together. The movie is quite good but it fails when it comes to acting-specially by the lead actor,and the movie is quite lengthy at some parts.The climax is something which you always expect and see from the typical Indian Horror Movies.Some scenes are quite scary,but not to the level to which you will be chilled-however these scary scenes are quite less in the movie. Its good for viewing on weekends-and thats it.Rent a DVD. My Rating-6/10" 
" One of the best Bollywood horror movies!","This movie have everything, love story, thrill, horror and mystery. Where you can find all in one" 
" Vikram Bhatt's Ghost/Demon quartet:1920.","After having gone back and fourth for 2 years over sorting out a surprise "Bollywood night" for a friend, (which thankfully would not involve dancing,due to me having 2 left feet!)I decided a few days ago to at last finish with the stop/starting,and finally sort the planned night out.With being to sort out a Bollywood for my friend that was a little bit off-beat,I decided to pick up the second film in writer/director Vikram Bhatt's loose Ghost/Demon trilogy,which is also one of the few post-2000 Bollywood movies to be set during the UK occupation of a pre-Independence India.The plot:Quickly gathering his senses as he witnesses his father attempt to kill his fiancé,due to her having a different religious belief to their's,Arjun Singh Rathod pulls Lisa to safety,and attacks his dad for attempting to kill Lisa.Angered over his father's attempts to kill Lisa,Arjun announces that he is turning his back on his family and their strict religious beliefs,due to Lisa's love being the main thing that he holds dearest in the world.Desperate to leave the darkness in their lives behind,Arjun and Lisa get married in a low-key ceremony,as Arjun also searches round for an architect job,which will allow him to earn some money.Fearful over no job opportunities coming up,Arjun is relived to receive an invitation from a wealthy businessman to design a building that will be built over a soon to be knocked down,disused mansion.Shocked at the wonderful offer,Arjun is soon left speechless,when the business man says that he and Lisa can both live at the mansion,so that Arjun can make his design as precise as possible.Gripping the opportunity with both hands,Arjun brushes aside Lisa's complain's of there being something wrong with the mansion,by telling Lisa that she just needs time to get used to their new location.Attempting to stay true to Arjun's request,Lisa soon begins to find a deep fear slowly seep into her skin,when she notices a paining hanging in a mysterious room of the mansion,which bears an uncanny resemblance to herselfView on the film:Opening with a gliding shot of a horse driven carriage to the mansion,co-writer/ (along with Girish Dhamija,Sameer and Dheeraj Rattan) director Vikram Bhatt and cinematography Pravin Bhatt cover the film in a misty Gothic chill,with the Bhatt's keeping the mansion in low- light,so that every step that Arjun and Lisa makes round the mansion causes maximum tension of something bursting out of an unknown corner of the mansion.Being one of the few recent Bollywood movies to be set in a pre- Independence India,Vikram and Pravin Bhatt subtly include the tension in the air of the time,with all of the character's in the film being shown to have a strong unease of being around people with different political/social beliefs,which along with the movie's terrific Gothic element,makes the sometimes goofy looking special effects ones that are easy to forgive.Whilst the screenplay's message of staying true to your roots and excepting others no matter what their belief's are is delivered in a well meaning,but heavy-handed way,the writer's make sure that any risked of preaching is kept away by a strong wall of Gothic Horror,with the writer's slowly revealing how tangled the mansion's centre has become with deadly Supernatural Horror roots,as Arjun and Lisa begin to unravel the truth behind the mysterious painting." 
" Unimpressive Disaster","I literally laughed on some scenes from this movie. An unjust commitment to make a horror movie just made me a little terrified for the future of Bollywood horror cinema. The movie was long and yes it very much resembles with the English version THE EXORCIST. I will give a rating of 2/10 in which 1 is for the sound effects and the other is for the spirit shown towards Indian FREEDOM with small portrayal about 1857 war otherwise you will be bored to tears if you like horror movies. Another reason why i rated low is an unimpressive performance by the lead actors and for the storyline, i mean it is predictable how this movie ends, same old story of revenge....i wonder did the filmmakers really watch their movies before making a release? P.S: Watch totally at your own risk !!" 
" Unreal locales and Clichés. Avoid this wannabe spook attempt!","After Raaz and his latest offering, Vikram Bhatt seemed to have taken over the scary mantle from the yesteryear Ramsays. Oh yes, talking of scary movies, how could I forget poor old RGV and his bhoots and phoonks! With fresh faces in the lead and a Yorkshire castle as the protagonist, 1920 attempts to take you a century back through time to an English locale complete with an ancient castle, church and similar buildings.The devout Arjun who begins every morning with Hanuman Chalisa falls for a Christian Lisa against the wishes of his family who threaten to finish her off. Avoiding the mêlée, they move to Mumbai where he works as an Architect. An assignment to demolish an old Mansion and build a hotel moves the couple to the spooky castle in Palanpur, where unbeknownst to them two architects before him have already met gruesome deaths.We are made to believe that the place is somewhere in Northern India where redoing the castle would help attract business from the Britons passing through the region. For one, you must appreciate the audacity of the movie makers to take our logic for granted. For a dated film there is your usual unnecessarily anglicized female lead. And as it comes free with every horror flick, there is a local church priest who doubles up as an exorcist.Audiences these days have evolved enough to expect the most old castles have some ghouls that usually posses the unsuspecting and curious damsel in the movie. We are used to scenes of a scared lady exploring the castle all alone inviting the spirits that follow her or call out her name menacingly. There is a distraction here though, an item number by raunchy Rakhi Sawant! Now, what is Vikram Bhatt trying to prove here? Its past, as is revealed later, is the case of an old 1857 traitor warrior who seeks refuge in the mansion. While on his job, Gayatri in patriotic interests scuttles it by seducing him. When killed, the soldier plans to avenge it by taking her soul away. Gayatri is now reborn as Lisa. Predictably, you have scenes of a possessed Lisa levitating and shrieking with creaking doors, flying objects, noises and a shady watchman completing the picture.While male lead Rajneesh Duggal has put in reasonable effort, Adah Sharma with wild eyes and overdone lipstick looks spooky without any need for a demon to possess her. Instead, the lady in the painting, Anjori Alagh as Gayatri is prettier. Adnan Sami’s Music is average. Art is reasonable though, while some special effects and make up are tacky. Despite all its attempts to spook you, 1920 is unworthy for your time and money." 
" A hint of this, a pinch of that, volla !!!!!","In a desperate cry, to make a horror movie matching to that of Hollywood calibre, I finally think bollywood directors, story writers have completely lost there minds !!!!!!First, take a reincarnation story (believe me, there is no scarcity in bollywood), now add few scenes from EXORCIST (1 & 4, mind it), a pinch of house related scenes from THE HAUNTING, and OH don't forget to put the icing on the cake, some knife cutting & floating in the air and then hanging in the form of a cruce scenes from STIGMATA and volla ! ! ! ! Here is 1920.Now i'm not saying it's all crappy. I mean come on ! ! movie drew it's all horror scenes from movies which are GEMS OF HORROR GENRE, so there are bound to be some good scenes. Although.. I still would recommend you rent above three movies instead, believe me u gonna write me a mail of gratitude. But if still there is some keeeda in you, then better fast forward the movie till interval." 
" A Failed Attempt","Though I am a Vikram Bhatt fan but I guess I was laughing all the time." 
" Far from scary, the plot is somewhat silly (3/10)","The movie loosely resembles the Exorcist with concepts of afterlife added to it. Basically a young couple lives in a large mansion with the woman becoming possessed. The rest of the movie is about trying to save her from the spirit. The climax of the movie is so silly. Usually horror movies have some basic logic based on religious rituals, but here even that is missing. Very disappointed after watching this."
