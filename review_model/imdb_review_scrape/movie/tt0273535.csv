" the Rawails are bad filmmakers","this is just another bad movie from Govinda and this time again he isn't in a comedy this is a typical bad movie with the predictable climax although the climax was enjoyable the movie however was not doing that songs were crappy movie started crappy and throughout just a bad movie songs would've helped the movie but i guess they sucked a creative story Dil Ne Phir Yaad Kiya is a creative thriller but if it were more psychotic it would have been good instead of being sad as hell not that sad but still sad enough that you can just hate it Rajat Rawail did not do a good job and if he made another movie it would use the same crap it did in this movie it's just the way some bollywood directors are you can like the same elements they would put into movies and some you won't just like this one"
