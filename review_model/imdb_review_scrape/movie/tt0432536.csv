" Horrible","Imagine a film starts shooting in 1992 and releases in 2004. Quite a long period. The film was one of Akshay's first films which got delayed and finally released in 2004 when Akki was going through a good phase. The film has such a stupid concept which has no logic, it looks dated to 70s when people believed in ichaadari naags. The film has most shots taken in 1990s and some shots suddenly of old Akki are thrown in which make it look abrupt and inconsistentDirection is bad Music is good but sounds datedAkshay Kumar is hardly convincing, this film started in those days when he was a struggler and not an actor and it shows Varsha Usgaonkar is okay, Rajendra Gupta is okay, Laxmikant Berde provides some laughs but gets irritating, Navin Nischol,Reema Lagoo with dubbed voices are okay" 
" Completely Outdated","Akshay Kumar is one of Bollywood's most polished actors, action turned comic hero Akshay has always impressed despite choosing many wrong films. Akshay Kumar has always completed ever single one of his films even if they were shelved for 2-4 years. This is the rule that goes well with this film Hatya. The film probably started as early as 1992 and was in cans till 2004. This is definitely one of the most long delayed films I've seen and boy was I disappointed as usual. Neither was their any actual entertainment in the movie nor did the movie make sense from most perspectives.Hatya the Murder is a story about Ravi Lal who is some kind of amateur Casanova. His character is not well built because at times, he acts like a rich Casanova who doesn't care about working hard. However, at one point he looks like a hard working individual. The initial comic scenes are stupid and the comedy doesn't work because it is poorly executed and a formula that has been used by most Bollywood films before. Ravi has a dad Ratan and a sister, he also has a childhood sweetheart Kavita. This girl is played by Varsha Usgaonkar who isn't seen in films anymore. She is said to be some kind of snake researcher but in the film, she is mainly seen romancing Ravi. Some people want Ratan's farmhouse and when they can't get it nicely, they have Ratan killed and Ravi's sister molested. Ravi is wounded and left for dead. It is then a snake becomes a part of him and takes revenge using his human form.The biggest flaw of the film is why doesn't Ravi manage to fight of the villains when they first attack Ratan and Ravi? He seemed to do so well counterattacking them but suddenly he gets trapped. The action scenes are raw and well choreographed but it's unbelievable how the action is dragged especially in the ending. The heroine has a 20-30 minute role because it's the snake's revenge the second half mainly focuses on. The first half also has some other random comedies thrown in for some laughs which backfires completely. The film also fails from the musical aspect, there are no memorable and melodious tunes, all songs are added mainly to drag the film. The romantic angle is weak and Akshay's Casanova act makes the romantic angle look extremely weak. Another major blunder is the climax which just drags and drags till Akshay somehow manages to murder the villains in a clich√©d way. In short, the film is something that might've worked in the 80 and 90s, but this decade is not for these kind of outdated movies.Akshay Kumar look keeps changing from the 1992 Akshay to the mid 1994-1996 Akshay to the late 2002-2003 Akshay. His performance is decent in parts because he was a mediocre actor in his early days. The 1992 portions aren't worth speaking of, the 1994-1996 portions are good and the late 2002-2003 portions which is some of the songs and the climax are decent. Overall, a fairly decent performance. Varsha Usgaonkar has the looks but not the acting skills. Her snake dance is sexy but her acting is fairly OK. Navin Nischol does what is required and his act is nothing to shout about. Laxmikanth Berde is annoying as the evil cousin of Akshay. Johnny Lever has no scope and his comedy falters completely. The villains are typecast and their acts are hilarious. The main villain and the Mumbai toned side villain evoke unintentional laughter. The rest provide average support.Direction by Kader Kashmiri is outdated and works only for it's time being. He does display Ravi's tension and arguments between the good and evil regarding the farmhouse properly but in general, the treatment of the film is bad. It looks like a revenge drama that is completely outdated for a 2004 films.On the whole, Hatya is one of those long delayed movies that didn't work at the box office. The film was completely outdated when it released and it didn't find any kind of audiences, it failed to appeal." 
" Terrible!!","This movie is definitely for those die-hard Kumar fans who wouldn't mind watching him in his worse performances.... I was a bit confused... The girlfriend tells him she's going to meet him the next week and in a week's time Akshaye looks 10 years older... and in another part of the song they both look 10 years younger again.... And then i read some reviews on this movie that said it took 12 years in the making.... Serious trash.... Why would they bother continuing this movie at all.... And Pankaj Berri does a horrible job trying to speak in that mumbaiyya tone.... Jhonny Lever over acted his scene which was of no use to the movie..... well all i have to say is.... even if u get this movie for free... i suggest u don't waste your time... it's complete crap...." 
" Worst Akshay Kumar Movie Ever","A true Akshay Kumar fan Might like this venture, but admiring Akki's features this one I was very disjointed.This movie took about 12 years to make and you can tell be akki's appearance though out the movie.The climax seen was very weird and confusing, i am surprised Akshay Kumar participated in a movie that took so long to make.If you want your evening to be completely boring, then getting this feature will be a step in the right direction.My Ratings: 1 Out of 5 (1:Boring, 2:ok, 3:Average, 4:Very good, 5:Excellant)"
