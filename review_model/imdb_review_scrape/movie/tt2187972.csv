" Sitcom humor of / for seasoned duo","Kudos to débutant director Bela Bhansali for bold and idiosyncratic theme of bringing together well deserved talented duo. Magnetic factor to attract audience is the middle-aged love story, thinking away from routine typical teenyboppers, and trendy title..toh nikal padi. Yesteryear's hit Khatta Meetha must have been the inspiration of taking Parsi community's humor, which is evident in the character, accent, names, mannerism and dialogs. Boman Irani a seasoned artist plays the role of Farhad Pastakia, a bachelor, at the end of his youth, and seeking partner whom he wants to marry purely for love, certainly not to please his kith n kin's. He is a salesman in a lingerie shop and has pride attached in his expertise to measure any women's bra size by mere sight. Quite a daring man. Unfortunately he is too honest and his line of work goes against impressing any decent family, or even girls, who walks away as soon as they learn of his profession.Faraha in the role of Shrin Fugawala in her forties, working as secretary for a Parsi Community Trust with carefree and tomboy image to blow and blast any body who is not willing to listen her. After proving her ability in Choreography, Direction and presence in idiot box, she is desperate to en-cash her celebrity ranking and fulfill dream cum true a lead role on big screen.Somehow the chemistry sparked between Farhad and Shirin, seems love at first sight. Like any Indian marriage, parent's approval is essential and unknowingly Shirin end up annoying Farhad's mother, the role played by yest year's veteran Daisy Irani. The sequences enhance flavor of the film and adds laugh out loud moments. All the supporting cast is adorable and you will love to watch them in their every act, but hats off to Boman Irani.Songs seems to have been forced by creating dream sequence and choreography is flimsy. It seems that movie has been planned as quickie due to budget constraints and proper homework was not done on various fronts of film making: Script was lacking punches, Farah's dialog deliver was too casual and no dramatic effect, and so is her choreography. Am sure they could have taken better inspiration from veteran movie Khatta Meetha. The movie did not look like from the producers and director of Devdas and Dil DE chuke sanam.But flaws can be excused as the overall movie is definitely entertaining and delivers nice moments. It is truly quoted in the film that love has no expiry and supports the fact that love has no age barrier. Well try and sequel is welcome." 
" A Nutshell Review: Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal PAdi","It's a rare occasion when Bollywood decides to junk those six pack, rock solid abs, and that shapely hour glass, proportional figure, from its leading characters, with superstars idolized by millions cast as lovers and setting the stage for an incredible love story, for something that's more grounded to earth. Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi is that love story about middle aged singles finding each other serendipitously, and falling in love in the process. Without much fan fare, without incredible trips to far flung reaches of the world. Just in and around your neighbourhood, when you least expected.Boman Irani is probably best known by most for his role as the principal in 3 Idiots, and he's arguably just about being one of the best character actors in Bollywood, despite having to usually play someone's dad in his movies because he's middle age. Here he reclaims the leading role as Farhad, the singleton who's way past mid life, and constantly being egged on by those in the family, either with love or being mocked at, to get hitched. It's just that he doesn't have much luck at the romantic front, and his job as a salesman / consultant at Tem Tem's Bra and Panties Shop, doesn't endear him to the opposite sex who are looking for a partner with a more glamorous job to boast about.But his honesty is just about that primary trait he exudes, coupled with that filial piety that's overlooked, with Daisy Irani and Shammi playing his mother and grandmother respectively, almost always threatening to steal the show with their comical timing and personifying the loveliness in a zany household, ribbing Farhad for this single ways, yet eager that he soon finds a soulmate after failed attempts at variations in matchmaking. But the expanded household sometimes got in the way especially with its rather feeble attempts at jokes, such as an Uncle's probable Alzheimer's induced infatuation with Indira Ghandhi, that may be cute in the beginning, but got a little bit tired when it stayed past its welcome in the narrative.Still, the revelation here is Farah Khan. Yes, THE Farah Khan, who had masterfully choreographed item numbers in countless of Indian films, as well as turning into a filmmaker, being in the director's chair for films such as Main Hoon Na, Om Shanti Om and Tees Maar Khan, the latter which I enjoyed even if it got ravaged by most. She goes in front of the camera as the spinster Shirin, who got amused by her first encounter with Farhad at the Tem Tem shop, before as the story would have it, like Romeo and Juliet, become his only love sprung from whom he should have hated, being responsible for ordering the demolition of an illegal water tank that Farhad's dad had installed in his family home. This sets up for the perennial war between the would be daughter-in-law with her potential mother-in-law, if the blessings to get married do come.Being the rookie actress, her rawness does get noticed, but somehow this was somewhat refreshing, rather than the countless of flawless performances put in by the Bollywood idols that put them too high up on the pedestal. Director Bela Bhansali Sehgal had worked the chemistry and pairing between Boman Irani and Farah Khan to wonders, and their starring opposite each other in many courtship scenes, while expected in its development, turned out as what would be best thing about the movie. Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi is as simple as it can get in storytelling terms, with the director applying uncomplicated techniques that won't distract the audience, and sometimes, plain vanilla is something that works best, even when the thin story tried its best to stretch itself toward the two hour mark. For a Bollywood film, the songs here didn't quite stick after the end credit rolled, and while Farah Khan does show a knack for dance (for sure, right?), Boman Irani did look a little bit awkward here when required to perform.And for all the singles out there, with paunch, belly and all, perhaps this romantic comedy will provide that glimmer of hope that all is not lost. It addresses the constant pressures one may get from well meaning family members, even drawing upon real world scenarios such as the protection of one's clan or turf through population numbers, without which some heritage would be lost. Or addressing the habit of judging someone at face value, or profession, and drawing all sorts of conclusions from it. A lingerie salesman you say? I'm sure some would jump at the opportunity without hesitation!" 
" A 'beyond decent' watch :)","For me, movies should be judged by whether it fulfils your expectations. It doesn't matter if films like Bodyguard or Ek Tha Tiger or Ra. One break records. If you promise say, an action movie, you should deliver it. Shirin..does deliver. Its a sweet simple store. Decent acting, great humour and some meaningful (though occasionally stretched) drama. Expect a good gentle flick, and there would be no disappointment. Both Boman and Farah are good, with able support by everyone else. Its just the songs that seem unwanted at places. Overall, quite a watchable fare. Quite a welcome change from all the meaningless masala stuff Bollywood is churning out these days! Go for it :)" 
" A nice and sweet film","Watched " SHIRIN FARHAD KI TO NIKAL PADI". It is a nice and sweet film. Director Bela Bhansali Sehgal has proved herself that she can handle a sensitive film. This movie is a fine blend of humor and emotion. There are few scenes where you have to laugh like mad. Story by Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali is good. Screenplay is also good. Dialogues are impressive. Music is also soothing , lyrics supports the music very well. Performance wise Boman Irani, he is such a fine actor that you can't turn your look to another one. . Surprisingly debutant Farha Khan is also fine and good. Daisy Irani as mother of Farhad does well. Rest actors support well. First look and trailer were indicating the strength and freshness of the movie. It will be a slow starter but gradually it should grow up by positive mouth publicity. Good for multiplex audience. Happy to watch it." 
" Sheer waste of Time...no story and confused direction","It was a sheer waste of 2 hrs of weekend morning. There is no story. Its the same of Bolly wood script twisted slightly modified to give it a new look. Seems none of the youngsters were ready to do the movie with the original script so they modified it to make it a love story for two middle aged folks.There was not development of the characters.The director had no clue on what he/she was trying to make. It was not a comedy for sure.The uncle thrown in to add some humor fails miserably in doing so. Farah Khan should stick to what she does better. A person who has undergone a Botox treatment can give better expression than her.The only saving grace was Boman Irani, but with such a pathetic script even he could not do much." 
" Shirhin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi (U/A)---------my Rating : 3/5 Like this page : https://www.facebook.com/MovieReviewByYunusIrshad","Shirhin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi (U/A)---------my Rating : 3/5It is a clean romantically drama between the aged ones ....* Farah and Boman were stunned their performances and story was predictable .....* Music was good and fresh to listen .....* Direction and camera was average ......The movie is short and contains a very slow screenplay that leads the movie much more longer....Comedy was average .....Story was not convincing but it was not boring......It is a clean one time watch .......Shirin (Farah Khan) and Farhad (Boman Irani) are two 40+ middle aged Parsi people leading their lives amidst a fast dwindling Parsi community. Self content and enveloped in their daily wordly affairs, they have not had the time to pause and think about love. That is - till they meet each other!" 
" Hilarious!","My Mom was pretty eager to watch this movie as it is based on a middle-aged couple; so i finally took the time out yesterday and went to watch this with her instead of the infamous release - Barfi. I liked the trailers pretty much because the story seemed different. So expectations were there for the movie to be good enough. And well, I wasn't disappointed. it is HILARIOUS, a complete laugh-riot. My mother couldn't stop laughing 80% of the time. And neither could I most of the time; and this is coming from a 20-year old who HATES Bollywood humor (which is mostly toilet-humor), so hardly watch any Bollywood comedy (other than Priyadarshan). So you can sense, it is NOT toilet humor and a decent comedy. Boman Irani is fantastic, Farah Khan is really good, the supporting cast worthy too! Just go watch for a light, happy watch. And encourage more such movies to come out. :)" 
" Oscar Winner MARTY meets his cute Parsi version served with a spicy Indian curry.","Primarily promoted as a comedy, SHIRIN FARHAD KI TOH NIKAL PADI serves the purpose pretty well in its first half. It does make you smile, laugh and even embarrasses the viewer in a funny manner with its few sequences related with Boman's undergarments shop. So one feels like being fairly entertained in its initial reels but post interval it simply becomes a jumble of both good and bad moments which are not able to entertain the viewer in the same manner as successfully done by its first half.Now the major reason of this sliding down remains its easily predictable plot which loses the grip once the audiences know that what is going to happen next. Till they don't have the clue about its basic storyline, they enjoy it thoroughly. But once it moves down to the same ages old path, the film fails to deliver and is not able to make any kind of major impact on the viewer. Moreover the absurd sequences towards the end, like the father waking up from the coma and the gas trouble faced by an old man really put you off and one loses his interest in watching it further.Here the point which needs to be raised is that, when Indian Viewers are ready to accept new concepts and ideas as proved by many recent hits, then what's the need of ruining a good movie by inserting the same old twists & turns leading towards a typical Hindi film climax unnecessarily? Bela's first venture here is undoubtedly a fine attempt by a debutant made on an unusual subject but why she hesitated to tackle it differently in its second half remains questionable. Either she had no faith in her target audience or she simply bowed down to the commercial elements involved in film business today as it seems. But whatever be the reason, she really missed the opportunity of making a fine film unarguably.SFKTNP also catches your instant attention due to its surprising cast featuring Boman Irani and Farah Khan as its leading couple in love. However out of the two, Boman once again scores the maximum with a worth watching performance of a middle aged lonely Parsi looking for his lady love from years. Farha Khan on the other hand, looks exactly like her character on screen, performs well and entertains confidently in her first lead role as an actress. Yet I also felt as if she was doing it too casually taking it just like a fun assignment for a change. At times she is a complete natural but in some scenes it seems like she really doesn't care about the end result on the screen. In the supporting cast both Daisy Irani and Shammi Aunty are simply adorable and make their presence felt throughout.Musically, the film could have easily done with only its fine title song being repeated in the background. But as per the Hindi film routine it does have few average tracks which sadly don't impress or move the story further. Cinematography and Background score just supports the movie's theme as required but dialogues don't really work when the writers try to be over funny in few sequences of its second half.Coming to the title of this review mentioning an Oscar winner movie, the Bhansali banner continues with their decades old trend of making inspired films borrowing the basic plot of their script from a World Classic. This time its Delbert Mann's directed MARTY (Black & White) released in 1955 which also won the Academy Award for THE BEST MOVIE due to its honest portrayal of a lonely middle aged man looking for a life partner. In MARTY too there is man with a heavy built up, who is fast passing through his 30s and is yet not able to find his perfect life partner for various reasons. He lives with his mother and wishes to buy the shop he is currently working in as a salesman. The film also has the characters of his aunt and a friend who keep pushing him for getting married fast. And when he meets the right lady, he goes through a character transformation within days, which remains the main focus of this realistic classic featuring Ernest Borgnine in the lead.Admittedly SFKTNP is not a blatant version of MARTY as you might be thinking. But it does take its basic elements from the same, changes the settings to PARSI characters and then adds all the Hindi Film gimmicks to it in order to make it a spicy dish ready to be served to its Indian viewers starving for something different. In true words, this was again a good choice of subject by SLB films to be presented before us following their own style of film-making. But I really wish Bela had made it more artistically keeping the core essence of the plot intact.However in its present avatar, (in all possibilities) the Parsi community may not like the movie whole heartedly, as it portrays them more like some eccentric people living their lives in a distinctive manner away from the normal. I personally loved and still remember watching PESTON JEE as one of the best films made around a Parsi character. Plus the recent FERRARI KI SAWAARI was a decent one too. But somehow that decency seems to be lost in this latest flick and I didn't really enjoy the community's portrayal in it at a personal level. Still for the common viewer, the film can only be rated as an average entertainer which probably would work more when you will be watching it on the channels or Home Video without spending much of your money and efforts." 
" Boman steals the show!","'Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi' is a cute film, but a tad predictable, as well. However, Boman Irani steals the show with a heartfelt performance!'Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi' Synopsis: Two middle aged unmarried people find love & decide to settle down. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Story has its share of cute moments. The romance between its middle-aged protagonists touches your heart & the dialogue, also, are sweet. But, the second-hour is dragging. Also, this ideally should've been a song less film. The songs look out of place & add to the film's stilted pace. Bela Bhansali's Direction is simple. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing needed more crispness. Performance-Wise: Boman is the lifeline of the enterprise. He's wonderful. Farah Khan's raw performance is satisfactory, as her character demands the brashness. Daisy Irani irritates. Shammi Aunty is simply adorable. Kavin Dave is fantastic in a brief role. On the whole, despite its flaws, watch it for Boman's act." 
" Recommended if you have free time","It's a crazy ride guaranteed to leave you grinning as you leave the cinema. That makes it worth a watch. The biggest flaw is the lack of a well thought out central conflict, still it's enjoyable.Farah Khan is best when she's not acting, her persona suiting the role. S ehgal's film seems a lot better than it is due to the performance of the two actors and the chemistry between them. On the whole, Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi is a simple, unfussy and heartfelt movie that hits the right notes. The film supports the fact that no one is too old to fall in love.Truly, this wonderful love story has no expiry date. Recommended!A quote from sonam's tweeter Twitter Buzz @sonamakapoor: Best of luck for shirin farhad @TheFarahKhan ! From the buzz that's going around btown..Its gonna be great!" 
" Half cooked Parsi Dhansak devoid of any namak","It is a story about 40+ Parsi leads who fall in love during the course of time and how they end up being together despite some parental opposition.Boman Irani is the one who steals the show with his sincere attempt in infusing life into his character of Farhad Pastakia. The débutante Farah Khan looks very awkward in enacting the role of Shirin Fuggewala. She shall stick to choreographing songs and directing movies. She doesn't seem to be playing her character but just mouthing her lines without much interest. Supporting cast includes - Daisy Irani and Shammi aunty who are very good in their respective roles.It feels good to see a film completely dedicated to happy-go-lucky, good-hearted but now dwindling Parsi community. Bela Sehgal has cast all real Parsi actors in the movie which gives it an authentic look. But the real problem here is a wafer thin story. The film entertains in parts. There are too many songs clubbed into this 2hr long movie. But I have to say it that this film is a welcome change from now-regular offensive, and juvenile comedies. The film tries to revive that middle of the road cinema once popularized by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Bhattacharya in 70s-80s. But Bhansali could have paid more attention to the story and screenplay, then the film would have been much more enjoyable. There is only one reason to watch this film which is Mr. Boman Irani.. undoubtedly one of the best actors we have in India today.The film tries to put forward this point bit loudly that love has no expiry date.Anyways, its a decent, simple Parsi affair." 
" An out of the trend love story in Bollywood- a love story between two middle-aged!","There is nothing safer than to make your first movie designed on the Hrishikesh Mukherjee brand of movies. Debutant director Bela Bhansali Sehgal, daughter is Sanjay Leela Bhansali has done the exact same thing. The result is a sweet, short and uncomplicated story with many funny and feel-good moments.As mentioned earlier, Shirin Farhad ki Toh Nikal Padi is based on the kind of movies that we were used to when Hrishikesh Mukherjee was in his prime. Shirin Farhad ki Toh Nikal Padi has many good characters with a heart of gold. You get the chance of seeing their lives, how they deal with their problems and how easily they resolve any issue without making a fuss.Sehgal tries to fill some Bollywood moments like dreamy songs and occasional drama in her movie about two Parsis in their forties finally finding love. One might feel that Bela Bhansali Sehgal has tried to make a spoof of some popular Bollywood movies. However, it is advised to keep your logic at home before you watch this movie. The story revolves around Shirin (Farah Khan) and Farhad (Boman Irani). They are middle-aged people who are still waiting to find their true love.Farhad is 45 years old but he still is afraid of his mother and is shy when it comes to talk to people. Shirin is responsible to bring Farhad out of his shell and Farhad finally finds someone with whom he could share all his dreams and even his craze for Dukes' Mangola. Shirin is impressed by Farhad's simple nature and they evidently become a couple. However, they face trouble soon as their families are against this relationship. The movie is filled with many laugh-till-your-stomach-hurts moments. For example, the scene when Shirin comes to meet up with Farhad's family is one of the many laugh-aloud moments in the movie. The comic relief and humor is consistent and well spread across the whole film. Farhad as a character is entertaining more so because of the fact that Boman Irani has brought this character alive with his little touches and an effortlessly flawless performance. His interactions with Shirin are funny and at the same time romantic. At one point, Farhad spells out his matrimonial bio, as if out of habit, while expressing his love for her. "Name: Farhad, Age: 45," and so on, before proclaiming: "First love: Shirin. Last love: Shirin."One will understand why Farah Khan was chosen for this role after watching this movie. She fits into the character of Shirin from every angle. Actually, the whole movie stands out just because of the chemistry between its lead pair. There are a few Parsi actors who give the movie a more ethnic feel like Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal and Kurush Deboo. We also get to watch the enigmatic Shammiji after many years of absence. She portrays the role of Farhad's grandmother to the hilt.A few points that could have been avoided or made better are the inconsistency in the storyline, production values not as high as one would expect from a Bollywood flick and unnecessary music. There are too many songs and they only slow down the pace of the movie. The Parsi- style jokes are funny in the beginning but they seem to become a drag by the end of the movie. In almost two hours, Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi delivers enough for a viewer so as to not grumble about wasting money and time on it. I will advise you to watch Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi for some truthful moments and an endearing performance by Boman Irani." 
" Good film","Boman Irani debutted in Bollywood when he was in his 40s and this is his first lead role at the age of 53. The film is very unique in that aspect that the stars are not stars but characters and that is what works. The story is simple and treated well, For once the Parsi Community aren't carricatures and that is a blessing in disguise, After Ferrari Ki Sawari this year which also had Boman Irani this is another film that shows Parsis.The film is treated like a romcom but the story does seem believable, the emotional aspect of Boman is well depicted, His falling for Farah is also well depicted. There are several underwritten humour lines which are funny and some slapstick moments, some do tend to be exxagerated thoughThe film does get melodramatic towards the end though but the climax is fantastic and well shown, Boman's confrontation too is awesomeDirection by Bela Sehgal is superb Music by Jeet Ganguly is pleasant but the songs add to the length of the film and it would be better if it was a songless filmDialogues are fabBoman Irani is matchless as Farad, Only he could play the character, The actor who received tremendous acclaim since Munnabhai MBBS to most of his other films except some where he was made to act like a buffoon shows his talent yet again and shoulders the film. Farah Khan for her debut is decent, though her dialogue delivery could've been more effective, she at times speaks like she is giving an interview but she does handle the emotional scenes well Amongst rest It's a pleasure watching Daisy Irani after a long time, she is a delight faintly reminded me of Vicky's mom character in Vicky Donor but she is simply fabulous Shammi Aunty too is superb, though she does look pale and thin yet she does a great job It helps that his actors are real Parsis and that works big time Kavin Dave has a brief role and does well Kurush Deboo who always acts as a Parsi does well Dinyar Contractor seen after a hiatus is okay rest are all good, especially Boman's aunty" 
" Cute but stretched and very predictable","Boman, a Parsi, is 45. Dominated by his loving mother. Cherished by his grand mom. Is sweet and honest, even explains the truth patiently to a prospective brides family when his mother exaggerates to get the rishta through. Is tired of people belittling his profession, that of a lingerie salesman, despite everyone having to wear underwear. Is hounded by some well- meaning relatives, who ask too many questions and try to run his life.He gets a shot at romance when he meets and falls for Farah, another Parsi, whom he meets in his shop. She is feisty and straightforward, lives with her comatose father and unwed paternal aunt. She hits it off with Boman, both enjoy a few moments of romance. But soon, thanks to a squabble regarding an ancient tank, Boman is forced to make a choice between Farah and his mom.The movie is cute, well-acted, clichéd and predictable. It would've been interesting as a short story, but seems stretched as a feature, with the conflict being nothing more than a storm in a teacup, the resolution as obvious as the recipe for a boiled egg. The writing is good, but here the dialogue needed to overcome the threadbare story and the characters needed to be able to surprise you occasionally to ensure interest was maintained. Neither occurs and so the movie remains in the territory of watch, but only with a remote at hand More at www.apurvbollywood.blogspot.com" 
" Very boring movie","The movie was very boring and slow paced. I like Boman Irani's acting but Farah khan acting was so bad that at some places it makes Boman Irani's acting looks bad. Her dialog delivery was straight. Her dialogs were expressionless. She was acting out of her character most of the time. Even the other side characters were acting better than her. There were so many moments in the movie when you will think, oh god why me... The songs may be good but they didn't suited them or their steps. There were some joke and scenes that make you laugh. Still, most of the movie was totally predictable. Its not worth watching in Theater. It was a total waste of time."
