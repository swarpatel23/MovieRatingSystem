" A decent film!","BEWAKOOFIYAAN brings back memories of Anubhav Sinha's AAPKO PEHLE BHI KAHIN DEKHA HAI and Rahul Dholakia's KEHTAA HAI DIL BAAR BAAR, besides FATHER OF THE BRIDE and MEET THE PARENTS. It won't be erroneous to state that BEWAKOOFIYAAN makes a genuine attempt to entertain beyond tested flavours and it succeeds in evoking genuine laughs at regular intervals. On the whole, BEWAKOOFIYAAN springs a pleasant surprise. Watch this wonderful slice of life film for the super performances of Rishi, Ayushmann and Sonam, watertight writing, skilled direction and dollops of humor. Bewakoofiyaan is a genteel, slice-of-life love story that runs with one of the oldest of the standard devices of the genre – strong parental opposition to a proposed marital liaison, with money, or rather the lack of it, playing a big part. But the film does not turn either overly nonsensical or sickly sweet in an ill-advised pursuit of comic effect and cutesy twists. The drama is easy flowing and the romantic track believable. Bewakoofiyaan scores with its disarming simplicity. Even as it doesn't soar to dizzying heights, it is never less than watchable." 
" Fun and Great time pass","I personally feel 5.5/ 10 is too low for the movie. True its the same gissi pitta old story but there is one thing about the movie and that is fun. Aayushmaan has acted superbly and to that extend even Sonam Kapoor. But the best act was put forward by Rishi Kapoor.There is something about the movie which gives you a feel good factor. If you are looking for a real intense and mind blowing acting then this one is not for you. But if you are looking for a nice movie which you can enjoy with your friends over the weekend then this the movie for you.Nice movie.... I would give it 7-8/10 ...though I have given 10/10 which is only to increase its current rating." 
" The desperation of being different and The fear of getting over-melodramatic dried the film out.","WHAT'S GOOD: The story is quite unpredictable actually.Even if you know what's gonna happen, it'll at least happen in a way that is different from your imagination. Rishi Kapoor is mind blowing.You'd kill to have a father-in-law like that. The music is entertaining. The movie keeps its comedy category noticeable in every minute.WHAT'S BAD: I guess everything else.The worst part is,there is almost no chemistry between the two 'lovebirds'. Sonam and Khurrana never reacted the way they should have... Not always their fault necessarily,but the shallowness of the story. In parts, may be you'll feel sorry for both, even a teardrop may dare to come out from your right eye(my case). But weird and meaningless EGO on-screen, will soon force it to get right back inside! The intention of being different and The fear of getting over-melodramatic made the characters alien from us.You'll watch it but wont be able to see life in it. The story will go on but sadly you'll not be able to connect with any of the leads other than Rishi Kapoor.But still, you'll like it for the laughs and a marvelous father-in-law. And if you are too kind, you might even love it.but I promise you, you wont be able to give it more than a 7.6 with love, out of 10 for all the good that this movie has to offer. One time watch for me. Surprisingly, I did enjoy it!" 
" A watch it for rishi sir guys!!! He just breezes through his act....","To start with ,I would like to dispel the fact that critics' r n not always correct, even they humans n thus bound to make petty mistakes, just like here, .. I myself got carried away by their take on d flick n forbade myself from watching it the release weekend but finding no other good release ,I finally got myself to see it, n boy, it ain't dat bad.. First things first, the movie belongs to Rishi sir, he just like amitabh sir is reinventing himself in his retirement age & his previous outings in last 5yrs.bear a testimony to that.. A role of a father, a Hitler types with his strict ,disciplined n honest approach to life, one who will not agree to a potential suitor with closed eyes n in fact will test him on all counts.rummaging thoroughly in his past., Be it his rough attitude towards his would be son-in-law , or his pride in mouthing" home secretary was my batch mate", he does it with gut-so n makes it so much pleasurable.. Sir , u just rock..Now the lead protagonists, both ayushman & sonam give a decent act, ., ayushman looks good but his boyish charm n act reminds one of his past flick, he sure knows how to act but d script gives him the same type of act.. Miss sonam looks cool & a style diva n performs well, in fact has got control over her act n authority that was missing till now .. The problem here isn't the acting, its mainly the script, which does not give the leads to grow & mainly focused on rishiji... & hence the movie's best parts are the moments between ayushman & rishiji, ya heard it right, if only the same zeal was shown in moments between the leads!!!!To add to it,the horrible music & lyrics , the awful choreography & then d cinematography, thankfully they were few.. Even shooting in a city like Delhi n not able to score on the visuals!! Set against d backdrop of recession, it can be anyone's story of ups n downs n d problems linked to it.. It ain't a two time watch, but it certainly is a time pass n kudos to dis yr.'s supposedly best supporting act..!!!" 
" A good light-hearted Sunday afternoon movie, with gf/bf :)","OK, first of all i see many people massacring this movie. I can understand why. This movie is only for a specific set of audience and not for all. If you are a Chennai express, Jai ho, Dhoom 3 fan you'll probably end up hating this movie. But if you are upto something light- hearted then this is one of the best which Bollywood can offer. I do not want end up giving away details of the movie. The storyline is pretty common one, a love story which we all can relate ourselves to. Music is pretty good. It goes well with movie. Raghu Dixit has done a good job with bg music. Now about performances and characters, Rishi Kapoor was too much adorable, he has something new to offer in this movie, a "Disguised Villain". Ayushman Khurrana seemed as if he continued his role from Vicky Donor, which is a good thing. Sonam Kapoor was a eye candy, she looks gorgeous in this movie. Verdict: Go for it. This is a feel good type of movie. I enjoyed Bewakoofiyan!" 
" Film justifies the title","Director Nupur Asthana work is fine but due to very old and many times told story, bad and traditional screenplay and just OK types dialogues, this movie comes out as a big boring. Starting 15 minutes of movie is good but after that it starts sinking and at the time of climax and pre climax it reaches at the level of unbearable. A person who is marketing executive and not aware about his credit card remaining limit or about his bank balance, where now a days all banks provide the detail of balance after every transactions through sms alert. There are such type of mindless scene. A person can enquiry about every minor detail i.e visa rejection, late income tax return filing about another person then how could he was unable to find the truth behind the person that he is working or jobless? Performance wise Aayushmann Khurrana is good. Sonam Kapoor is very good. Rishi Kapoor is outstanding. He makes every scene bearable or enjoyable with his performance only. Music by Raghu Dixit is good. Even after, good performance, good direction , good cinematography by Neha Parti Matiyani with good music movie fails to entertain only due to lack of content." 
" Simple and Sweet","Mohit (ayushmann) is a genius in marketing and he has a great love life happening with Mayera (sonam) who is a financial professional. They work hard and enjoy also the same. However, trouble comes in the form of Mayera's father Sehgal (rishi) who strongly believes that a rich man can keep his daughter happy. To add to the woes, Mohit loses his job due to recession. What happens after that forms the rest.The director has come up with a routine storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was the strength. The dialogues were witty and intelligent. The script was average but the screenplay made it lot better. The background score was melodious but songs were not impressive. Cinematography was efficient. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the trends and fashion while the art department was appealing. Ayushmann gave a confident performance and he was excellent at few places. Sonam Kapoor has improved more in performance and did well. Rishi Kapoor was fabulous as usual. Gurpal Singh was usual while Pratap was neat. Others didn't get much scope.The theme of girl's father playing the villain in a love story is age old but what matters is the way the whole thing has been woven and adding it with entertainment. In this film, the first half goes on the lighter note with elements of comedy, some romance and dance. The interval bang was interesting and the second half was filled with some energy. Of course, the ending could have been filled with some twists. Still, the film has enough for the audience to enjoy within the two hours. Overall the film is a simple,sweet, slice of film that is clichéd, but people who enjoy romcoms will lap at this film.3.25/5* or 6.5/10" 
" Slow But Enjoyable","Bewakoofiyan is enjoyable.After Gunday this is 2nd movie from YRF.This one is better than Gunday in order to screenplay,cinematography and direction. Story lies between Mohit(Ayushman Khurana) and his girlfriend Mayera(Sonam Kapoor) and her father V K Sehgal(Rishi Kapoor).Direction is superb.Movie's pace is slow and at some point very slow but because of good cinematography and screenplay it won't become boring.1st half is entertaining full of party,passion and many comic scenes.2nd half becomes sentimental and serious plus more slow than 1st half.Due to bad music movie becomes boring when songs start except Gulchchrey.There are so many touchy scenes in 2nd half.For me one of best scenes was interval scene like it is very nicely directed plus written. Rishi Kapoor is good as Hitler father.His expressions are superb in every ironically dialogs.Ayushman as always with one expression in every scenes.But he is very good in serious scenes.Sonam Kapoor is damn hot in bikini and most of other scenes.Sonam has given kissing scenes first time. Overall,this is not worth watching but from me it is recommended ! This is not that type of movie which will be liked by everyone but for real cinema lovers this is worth watching.Go for it,not highly recommended !!" 
" Cute movie","Nice, light comedy and fun movie. Good humor or and acting by all. Watch it to refresh your mind." 
" A One-Time Watch!","'Bewakoofiyaan' is A One-Time Watch! It has some charming moments, which stand out. However, a inconsistent second-hour plays a spoilsport.'Bewakoofiyaan' Synopsis: A hardworking guy, after losing his job, finds it difficult to deal with his materialistic girlfriend & her nagging father. 'Bewakoofiyaan' has an entertaining first-hour, which genuinely works. The sequences with the protagonist & his girlfriend's nagging father are interesting. Even the romantic-track has a charm to it. But, the second-hour is below the mark. Its consistent & sluggish. Habib Faisal's Story has merits in the first-hour, but fails to engage in its second-hour. Nupur Asthana's Direction is fair. Cinematography is claustrophobic. Editing is average. Music by Raghu Dixit is ordinary.Performance-Wise: Ayushmann Khurrana is fantastic. He's the best thing about this film. Sonam Kapoor looks sexy, but impresses only in some scenes. Rishi Kapoor is first-rate as the nagging father. On the whole, 'Bewakoofiyaan' works, but only in parts." 
" Watchable!","Its a nice movie. Ayushman and Rishi Kapoor has really tried their best to entertain you throughout the movie. They have shown amazing performance. At one point, you feel that story is getting dragged, but then doesn't matter, it is still a watchable movie. Go for it!" 
" Just OK.","Bewakoofiyaan- 2014 Director: Nupur AsthanaRomance in times of recession' can be a buzz kill. When currency crash leads to heartbreaks and house-breaks. And the youth are left with bankrupt dreams. The same happened with Mohit was actually searching a job but was only interested in working Airline Company due to which he had to suffer along with his personal life. Overall, Rishi Kapoor acted well, Sonam was Good and Aaayushman was also fine in the movie. The song were not so good. It was a low budget movie and with a very random story.The outfits worn by Sonam Kapoor in the movie were Very nice but once again Yash Raj Films wasted the money." 
" A One-Time Watch... but nothing more!","BEWAKOOFIYAAN is a romantic comedy directed by Nupur Asthana, starring Ayushmann Khurana, Sonam Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor, in the lead roles.The film revolves around Mohit Chadda (Ayushmann Khurana) who's the Senior Executive Marketing Manager at an airline company, and is engaged to Mayera (Sonam Kapoor). Life seems great, until he meets Mayera's father, who's interested in money more than love. And the whole situation becomes worse when Mohit gets fired from his job during recession.Bewakoofiyaan, inspite of facing cold responses from critics upon watching the trailer, is quite a watchable film. The plot is extremely predictable and seems copied from several romantic comedies involving the father's hand in marriage. However, the one factor that makes Bewakoofiyaan very different is the reality check it offers about modern relationships. Most romantic films involve everything being just fine; however, Bewakoofiyaan, set in the backdrop of the Great Recession, offers a very realistic view of how money indeed is necessary for a relationship to work.Inspite of all that, the film does have several flaws too; one of them being how the plot struggles to flow easily. Habib Faisal, who has written scripts for several great films like Band Bajaa Baraat, Ishaqzaade and Do Dooni Chaar, fails to stick one point. Case and point, he was trying to include the financial point of view of a relationship along with the idea of the main character impressing the father of his soulmate. The film would have been a lot better if it just stuck to one topic only.The acting is quite good. Ayushmann Khurana offers an extremely good performance as a short-tempered, egoistic bankrupt man, and Rishi Kapoor offers a great performance, as always. Sonam Kapoor still needs a bit work in terms of her acting. Her fashion sense is extraordinary, however, after showing how well she can act in films like Raanjhanaa and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, she returns back to her earlier performance that does not show any improvement, whatsoever. That being said, Bewakoofiyaan is watchable as well for its great performances and chemistry between the two main actors.The songs are quite alright to listen to, however, not extraordinary. Some of them are quite unnecessary in the film though and could have just been edited out of the film. In terms of the album, all of the songs are quite fine to listen to.In conclusion, Bewakoofiyaan is just a one-time watch. As the name suggests, it is quite stupid to give it an entertaining screenplay; fortunately, it doesn't go over-the-top. It could've been much better though, but since it fails to do, it is quite forgettable. But if you are looking for quite a fun timepass at the movies, Bewakoofiyaan is the film you're looking for.BEWAKOOFIYAAN- 5.5/10" 
" Bewakoofiyaan is a simple romantic / comedy movie with no emotional baggage.","Mohit Chaddha (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a marketing professional vying for a promotion at workplace. He is in steady love with Mayera (Sonam Kapoor), a financial brain with a great sense of fashion. Mohit is confident to win Mayera's dad V. K. Sehgal's heart (played by Rishi Kapoor). Life seems picture perfect for both of them until Mohit is given a pink slip soon after his promotion due to recession and economic meltdown. The Director Nupur Asthana's effort is to show the plight of a jobless professional, his initial "cool-confident-never mind, I would get another job" attitude to compromising with the job profile, his love life, intending to walk the aisle with the girl friend in spite of Rs. 653/- in the bank account, and above all taking the efforts during his 'probationary period' to impress would-be-father-in-law Ayushmann Khurana steals the show, he is natural, vivacious. Sonam Kapoor suits to the role of a high-flying professional. She really carries off well her branded costumes – Zara, Mango etc. and of course stylish footwear. She is not at all apologetic to admit that she earns so that she can afford various brands and live / enjoy her life, shopping, rock shows, movies, parties etc. Rishi Kapoor as Sonam's father does bright up the screen with his comic timings. He has displayed the attitude of an IAS officer (just-retired as well) and a protective father with great ease. He generates a great laughter, when he asks his would-be-son-in-law the attested copies of his PAN Card, Voter's Id card, Bank Account details, Aadhar Card etc., i.e. his complete credentials. All the face-off between Rishi and Ayushmann are good moments of humour. Music by Raghu Dixit does no wonder. This movie has six tracks with Anvita Dutt as the lyricist. The song Gulcharrey (sung by Benny Dayal & Aditi Singh Sharma) and Bewakoofiyan, the title song (sung by Raghu Dixit) are youthful (minus lyrics). Director Habib Faisal has penned down the lyrics of Khamakhaan, which is well sung by Neeti Mohan and Ayushmann Khuraana. The song Rumaani Sa (sung by Shreya Ghoshal and Mohit Chauhan) is good. Vishal Dadlani sang Aye Jigida, which is also just OK. Music could have been definitely far better. Overall, I feel, the plot lacks the depth, probably, the intention would have been to focus on the issues very lightly. The highlight of the movie, I must say, is the last scene. Let me not spill the beans, although the end is predictable, still it is a must- watch sweet scene.It won't be a Bewakoofi to watch Bewakoofiyan, a light-hearted movie." 
" for fools only","In Bewakoofiyaan- at least they got the title right, for it rarely rises above the foolish, being one long journey of excesses. Is it a satire on today's shallow consumerism? Or a medley of brand endorsements? Is it about the intricacies of yuppie, fashionable love? Or about the perils of recession pockmarked life? Either ways, Bewakoofiyaan is mediocre, dim-witted and uninspiring.Not that there is a story. The setting is flashy Gurgaon, specifically Cybercity. High rises, malls, coffee shops, and the occasional fisticuffs on the road- the signatures of Gurgaon is on show here. Young, upwardly mobile professionals Mayera and Mohit are very much in love. She, a Mango, Zara, Steve madden wearing chic financial whizkid, and he, arrogant and street smart, always struggling to keep up with his more gifted girlfriend. Unfair combination, right? Yes, that's what life is.Leave Mohit aside, but Mayera, despite her middle class upbringings and apparent emotional intelligence treats her love story as an endless materialistic and hedonistic journey- pubbing, shopping, dining, pubbing, shopping, dining, pubbing, shopping, dining...you get the point. He flashes a credit card with a 3 lakh limit, to which she pulls out one with a 5 lakh limit. Mohit lets out a sigh. It is that kind of movie.Things go downhill for him as he is laid off. On top of his demanding girlfriend and his own insecurities, Mohit has to battle a bulldog of a father in law who suffers from an extreme case of "no guy is good enough for my darling daughter" syndrome. Ayushmann had a crackling debut in Vicky Donor, but much like his character in the movie, he has been straining to match those highs ever since. Here he, like Sonam is curiously flat, and they have zero chemistry. Sonam has this carefully coiffured image of a fashionista in the real world, which she has carried forth in this movie too. But there is little else about her, and she seems to have forgotten to carry her acting manual onto the sets of Bewakoofiyaan. It is only the past few years that Rishi Kapoor has grudgingly buried the mantle of eternal lover-boy and experimented with variety- pity that he has realized so late in his career that villainy, drama, comedy all does come naturally to him. Here too he tries to keep things energized, but there is this much you can do when saddled with a bland script.Everything is forgettable- the music, the cinematography, the dialogs, the plot. There is zero emotional connect with the lead characters and that is kind of sad coming from a lady director who specializes in youth focused flicks. The film did not do anything to me, despite the familiar surroundings, or having actors that I like. Director Nupur Asthana barely touches upon real life issues such as joblessness, and changing gender expectations. Instead she focuses on buffoonery and style statements. Don't like, don't recommend. 5/10" 
" Just Another Romantic Comedy.","Do not expect anything from the film and you will leave the theater with glee. Because, as far as the humor & screenplay is concerned, it is built finely with entertainment as the sole purpose. There, it succeeds.Unfortunately, it is the desi version of Meet The Parents wherein the girl's father investigates about her lover. In here, the investigation is happening in the background as the father is busy fooling around his daughter & the guy. Father rejects at first, boy tries to impress, then loses his job, certain lies are told, father is happy, but what happens next is so predictable, I bet your 3-year old might guess it correctly.The story is surely cooked up, which lacks imagination. With certain amateurish insight into the corporate world, Bewakoofiyan stumbles in its own wire of monotony.Ayushmann Khurrana is good enough for the role, but let us agree Sonam Kapoor can't act. I liked Rishi Kapoor, but towards the end, even he lost interest in the play. Ounces of humor here & there, with a considerable amount of romance intertwined. 3/10 is a humble score.BOTTOM LINE: A couple may have a good time watching it together. But, this is easily forgettable.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
