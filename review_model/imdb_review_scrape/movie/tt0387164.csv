" A Simple Story about Two Parents Struggle Against the Corrupt System","Ashwini Chaudhary's 'Dhoop' takes a look into corruption of the governmental system. Unlike the several other films about corruption in India, 'Dhoop' takes a different turn. There is no overt bloodbath sequence or dramatic scene where the hero takes the law in his own hands, none of that nonsense. What we see is the parent's struggle against the corrupt system to keep the memory of their son and the several other brave soldiers who were martyred.Based on a true story, Chaudhary's film starts at a slower pace but it gradually picks up. The screenplay keeps the viewer engaged as we see how the professor overcomes each obstacle and the sacrifices he makes. Music also contributes well. Jagjit Singh's Ghazals are beautiful.Performances are a standout. Om Puri and Ravathi are truly excellent. One cannot help but feel for these two strong characters. Their performances look very natural and both prove that they are two of the best. In her debut film, Gul Panag definitely holds her own and her next films like 'Dor' and 'Manorama Six Feet Under' further prove that she's here to stay. In a brief role, Sanjay Suri does well. However, he looks a little too old for the part.'Dhoop' tells a simple story of the common man's struggle against the system. The ending is slightly dramatic but the strong acting and the screenplay more than make up for the flaws. Definitely worth a watch." 
" uncorrupted movie.","The only name that drew me to this movie was Om Puri. This actor has a commanding voice and an astounding screen presence so much, the younger actors have lot to learn from this veteran of method acting. The movie is an expose of Indian corruption on the background of martyrdom of a young son and the family's struggle to cope with it. Some scenes are very heartfelt and moving with flashbacks that seem enough to portray the depth of affection in the family. The tenacity of a father and his daughter-in-law(she considers herself a widow even though she was only engaged to him at his death-played seemingly well by a debutant actress) to take a road uphill againest all odds, is well told. Even though the movie lacks the typical Bollywood decorations, it is still gripping mainly because of the heartwarming story and Om Puri." 
" Slow, but Good!","This movie does the same thing as a typical Indian movie - exposing the corrupted government officials in India. But what makes this movie different is that it is based on a true story.With solid acting from Om Puri and Revati and its moving true story, you have a movie that is slow-movie but really worth watching.
The only thing I did not like about the movie was its numerous songs spread over the movie, many times seem to just thrown in.7.5/10. (Quite Good)" 
" Slow but heartwarming","This was a touching movie and had a few poignant scenes, for example, when Om Puri brings proof that he's Sanjay's father.  This is not the typical Bollywood movie of a hero unrealistically fighting against the corrupt Indian government.  Here, an elderly couple works their way through disgusting politics to immortalize their son who died while fighting in the Kargil war.  A strong-willed father wants to give his life meaning by means of a gas station.  The actress opposite Sanjay Suri gave a wonderful performance and a breath of fresh air by depicting an independent, self-respecting woman.  The only negative of this movie is that it is very, very slow-paced, and the part about the murderer doesn't make any sense." 
" An Excellent Movie shown of those after The Kargil Conflict","During my research on the conflicting between India and Pakistan on the "Line of Control (LOC)" in the Kargil region of Kashmir, I was told of this movie when I tried to find out what had happened to the survivors, their families and to the families of those who never returned. But to satisfy myself, I continued with the research.A certain Captain Rohit Kapoor is killed in action on the "Line of Control" in the Kargil sector of Kashmir. His parents, unaware of his death, who have been waiting for his call, are taken by surprise and shock when the mother finds her husband unconscious and on the floor after answering a call.But after recovering, the father breaks the news to the mother that their son has been killed in action in Kargil. He then calls his son's girlfriend. She, with support from her parents, decides to help her late boyfriend's family as they struggle to survive. The movie stars Sanjay Suri, Om Puri, Revathi and Murli Sharma. One of the parents of a certain Captain, who unfortunately didn't return from the Kargil conflict, like many others, told me that that fighting corruption, after he was informed of his son's death, was like fighting another "Kargil" conflict - only this time it was the Indian government and not any intruders who had illegally crossed a "Line of Control." "Dhoop" is partly based on a real life story and depicts how were the survivors and their families and of those families who lost their loved in the 1999 "Line of Control" Kargil conflict and is slow, like an art movie. Perhaps the only downfall ( and I wouldn't even call that) is probably that it had too many songs. But one song that outshone the others was "Benaam Se Yeh Dard," sung by the legendary Ghazal singer Jagjit Singh," is one that is really worth listening to.For those who have watched J.P. Dutta's "LOC KARGIL," should consider watching this." 
" Superb film","Ashwini Chaudhary who recently gave us Son of Sardar, once upon a time gave us such a good film. DHOOP is based on loosely based on Captain Anuj Nayyar, MVC and his family. The film tells a story of a soldier who dies fighting and how his parents fight to get a petrol pump that was assigned to him after his death as a tribute. The film exposes the corruption in Government Machinery, something Mahesh Bhatt did earlier too in SARAANSH but this film too is superb. The film holds your attention throughout, though the first half is slow paced yet the handling is good, even the songs act as a deterrent yet the director's handling of several great scenes make us overlook that. The entire part wherein Om Puri helplessly keeps fighting is superbly handled and till the end one is kept involved and moved.Direction is good Music is decent but too many songs make the film slowOm Puri is simply outstanding, no other actor could play his role so superbly, Revathy too gives him good support Sanjay Suri is likable in a cameo, Gul Panag is raw yet quite good for her debut, Ganesh Yadav,Yashpal Sharma all impress as always in their roles, Virendra Saxena is good," 
" A must-watch for those with pessimistic views about the Indian administrative and political system!","Excellent acting not only by Revathi and Om Puri but also by the entire bunch of actors playing the corrupt civil servants. Editing is disappointing in that scene to scene changes are abrupt and they remind you that you are watching a movie otherwise the movie makes you live the experience of the characters. Very good score and lyrics to go with the mood. There is definitely one loose end (go figure!). The message is clear that there is a silver lining visible only through persistence and sincerity.While this is not the first movie to touch upon this subject it is definitely an expression of awakening of the Indian public. This last sentence is forced into this review because there is a minimum-of-10-sentence requirement that I'm finding it hard to meet."
