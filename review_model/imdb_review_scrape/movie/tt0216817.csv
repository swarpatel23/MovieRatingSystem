" Wonderful Experience","HSSH is a real family entertainer. Suraj Barjatya has made the movie such that every portion of the movie fits into the main story line without any hiccups. The movie is visually rich, the music is fine. Also this is a clean movie without any sex,violence & if you are a fan of good family entertainers this is a must see.Excellent performance from all the actors and other technicians." 
" excellent","I loved the movie so much that i scratched the DVD. this movie is a treat to those who miss the plain and innocent look of Hindi cinema. the movie has been contributed to by all the characters in it.MOHNISH BAHL and TABU looked just FABULOUS. they played a more mature role as husband and wife.i felt that they were the BEST. i felt they were romantic in their own way...that kinda showed in the song mari hiwada main.TABU was AXCEPTIONAL and her more conservative role suited the plot.mohnish bahl was a treat to all those who hated him for being negative.he shows versatility in this movie. salman khan was a disappointment because he was too quiet.sonali was charming as usual. saif and karishma were basically a humorous part.they showed lots of chemistry though. i disagree with those who say that this movie was a waste of time and all that. but yes,i will say that this is probably the best movie i have ever watched till to date.(do not give your screen a bad look.i talk of myself.i don't represent the world) i loved the movie...hats off to the director." 
" Big Hit 1999","Rajshri continued to produced wonderful and memorable flicks like Tapasya (1976 Dir. Anil Ganguly), Chit Chor (1976 Dir. Basu Chatterjee), Ankhiyon Ke Jharokhon Se (1978 Dir. Hiren Nag), Sunayana (1979 Dir. Hiren Nag), Humkadam(1980 Dir. Anil Ganguly), Naiyya (1980 Dir. Prashant Nanda), Saaransh(1984 Dir. Mahesh Bhatt) & Abodh (1984 Dir. Hiren Nag).Most of these films presently now have more weaknesses then strengths. But at the time of their release, and when I viewed them during the 1980's, these films were very different in style and tone from the rest of conventional Hindi cinema. It is these films that help inspire forthcoming filmmakers, and innovate the bland Hindi cinema which is predictable and not satisfying.While most of their production remains quite unknown to many audiences, since their films was mostly consistent of new cast and production crew (making them really experimental at times), their last three production has become the most popular films ever in the history of Indian cinema. The films Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), Hum Aapke Hain Koun (1994) & Hum Saath - Saath Hain (1999) had broken box-office records around the world. All three movies was directed by Rajshri in-house director Sooraj B. Barjatya.The films each have a social message which looks at each stage of life....youth/love, love/marriage & family values. While I loved his first two movies, his present one was very disappointing as it falls behind by being too overly melodramatic, which at times become rather ambiguous to the whole setting and nature of the film.The first half hour feels like a theater production when all the characters enter the stage with their own mannerisms and characteristics. While this part has been handled well, I fail to understand why the need for so many characters. I was totally lost when all the secondary characters just entered the house (without a doorbell?) and made themselves feel too much at home. This creates an unease in the overall flow of the film. Maybe its just me, but I do feel that too much escapism was wrong at the start as it becomes too demanding on our part to make believe.Rather then break Hindi film conventions, which all Rajshri films have done in nearly all of their releases, Hum Saath - Saath Hain continues the trend set by Hum Aapke Hain Koun of an upper class family having functions, outings, businesses, and a big house. This in my view has been looked upon once too often, and seems rather tiring and predictable. This contrasted with what the director did for his first directorial debut Maine Pyar Kiya which, in 1989, resorted Hindi cinema back to the romantic genre for the 1990's. This helped the romantic genre become a profitable and popular format after one decade of violence and patriotism films.Planning of shots, art direction and performances are well executed. This shows how the director is very structured in what he wants to be visually shown on screen. But while the visuals are pleasing the overall plot, which is reminiscent of a modern day Ramayan, seems to be rather outdated. It is nice to see togetherness in a family but his concept was way over premising. It kept most of Ramayan philosophy into the plot rather then to fuse/innovate it with modern day influx of westernization which has taken over India with the advent of satellite television and of commercialism of products. Thus the film is not as up to date with today's audience.Another weakness detected in the film is the poor song score, which is also not in touch with audiences expectations. While the lyrics are very touching and heart warming (especially in the song 'Yeh To Such Hain' which is a dedication to parents), the music doesn't merit the soundtrack to be listened to on its own. Its decent enough while viewing the film, as both are suited as it twins well. However it lacks the soulful melodies heard in present films like Taal (1999). I presume due to the death of one of the music director it has impacted on the working technique once presented in the duo Raam - Lakshman. The background score is however very appropriate as it helps to interact with what the characters feel on screen.Where there is a negative lies a positive and this film has many. Like I mentioned before all the pr-production work done really shows the creativity the director has for his characters. There are many characters in this film, and for the director to ensure what will each be made of mentally and physically shows very well on screen. He personifies them through their personality, para-language, body language and even hobbies. The excellent art direction by Bijon Das Gupta captured by the wide cinema scope frame of Rajan Kinagi shows all of this creation quite well, and adds marvel viewing.Also the performance from all the cast, despite the weak plot, is very well handed due to the detail structure of the surround planning by the director. Karisma Kapoor, Aloknath, Tabu, Neelam and Saif Ali Khan displays wonderful moments of character acting, that surpasses most blockbuster stars currently in Indian cinema. Also Salman Khan performance is quite impressive despite having less screen time then most of the major characters. Here his shy charter is played to a tee and certainly contrast with his loud and crass characters in his past films like Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kiya (1998) and Hello Brother (1999).Despite being harshly criticize by many film critics, and by some audiences, the film became the highest grossing Indian film of the year 1999. The film might be a favorite with family audiences, but for individuals who crave for something new won't find this film satisfying." 
" If new to Bollywood movies, or an old hand, watch this film.","I saw my first Bollywood movie during a vacation to India in 2000.  Since then, I have seen at least 15 and have collected seven of the more popular recent releases.  This was the second movie I saw in the theaters there (the first was horrible except for an excellent dance number), and I enjoyed HSSH immensely.  Even without subtitles (and I don't speak Hindu), the plot, easy to follow, was not a barrier to what I considered to be excellent singing, dancing, and entertainment.  I loved Karishma Kaapoor and Saif Ali Khan, was exposed to several actors which appeared in subsequent movies which I enjoyed, and in short had a good time.  I have purchased this movie to show to friends as their first up-close encounter with Bollywood.   Since seeing this film, I have enjoyed   only one movie, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, more.  I would recommend this movie to anyone but particularly to someone trying to learn fresh about this key segment of the movie industry." 
" 'Loved It!","'Hum Saath Saath Hai' is a simple family drama. It's one of the films I enjoy most when watching with family. It's a colourful feel good film and not one that will make you seriously pick your brains. The moral of the story is that family should stick together, that's when they're the strongest. Just sit down and enjoy it without expecting a serious drama. The family tradition is nicely portrayed. Yes, it's larger than life and some might call it 'too good to be true' but it's entertaining. The set designs are impressive and the locales are spectacular (particularly the Rampur scenes). The songs are very pleasant and nicely add to the screenplay. In addition to that the dances have been beautifully choreographed. All the actors suit their roles very well. Tabu and Sonali add grace and sincerity to their characters. Tabu's downplayed expression in the scene right after Alok Nath and Reema Lagoo's argument is stunning. Sonali as the shy Preeti is amazing. She adds a lot of class and her body language is a standout. The two actresses are more than a positive addition. Karishma and Saif add to the humour. Saif is wonderful as the hyperactive Vinod as are Salman as the quiet Prem and Mohnish as the responsible Vivek. Alok Nath, Reema Lagoo, Shakti Kapoor and the rest of the cast are mostly brilliant. Neelam stands out as the sister. The three friends who play Lagoo's friends seem like caricatures. The plot is predictable but there's more to the film. I'd say it's one film best watched with the family. The only other Barjatya films I watched are 'Vivah' and 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' (so it's quite clear that his films aren't to be taken too seriously) but for me 'Hum Saath Saath Hai' definitely tops those two. I'd recommend watching and enjoying it with family." 
" Excellent","This film was very good. The fact that a lot people didn't like it was becuase it was too much compared to recent super hits such as Kuch kuch Hota Hai. This is a one of a kind as is every other film. the songs were superb, especially "Mhare Hiwda Mein" Sooraj Barjatay once again has made us proud. Well done." 
" Family film","Sooraj can't get over his HAHK, in this film too he brings another similar storyHere family is given more importance thoughAlmost every 2nd line is a sentence on family that lives together.etc No story in first half till half past second halfMost of the characters are too sugarcoated, even the villains are straight out of 80's the scenes are too theatrical with most actors hamming The last drama is well handled but things get too melodramatic at times the end is typical happy endDirection by Soraj Bharjatya is okay Music is nothing greatAmongst actors Mohinish gets the meatiest role and he plays his part very well though with too much earnestness at times Salman hardly gets any footage most of the film just gets some few lines but he gets focus towards the end and he is okay Saif is lively in his role and he is truly the Prem of HAHK in this filmTabu is okay, she too gets hardly anything much to do other then smile or sob Sonali too is just there Karisma hams into her part, mostly tossing her neck around Amongst rest Sadashiv and the 3 vamps are theatrical Reema and Alok are alright Neelam acts well Mahesh is okay" 
" a classic","I have seen this movie without any expectations. I haven't yet seen Hum Apke Hain Koun, and the only actress I knew is Karishma Kaapoor. I loved this movie. Though I am not Indian, I find that this movie reflects well Indian traditional values. I have seen the movie, on DVD, 12 times so far, and the only other movie I have seen more often is K3G. Although they are quite different, I find those two movies very similar. I have read various comments from users that find that this movie lacks focus, and starts after 2 hours. I disagree; I find that the family brake down is only a sub plot. The main thing is the exploration of the individuals that form the family and more particularly their respective love story. I find that the six actors play well balanced and equally important parts. Granted some have more lines than others but they are equal in their story importance or screen time. It is much harder to act without lines, only with expressions which is the case for Tabu, Sonali, and Salman. It is only on the superficy that some actors play a real dominant role. In my first viewings I was under the impression that sapne (karishma) stole the light, she has such a screen presence and energy that it is hard for any actor to compete. But, in later viewings I learned to appreciate more the importance of all the other characters. I particularly love the minimalist, face acting of Tabu, a true `rani' as, Sooraj Barjatay, wanted her to be. All together it is a great family movie, full of love and traditions. I particularly liked the love stories in relation of their divine archetypes in the songs that links the 3 brides to be. I find that this is the point of that movie. I also keep going back to the humorous presentation of the family to the new bride. Some of the music is great and all the songs help to advance the story instead of being the typical Bollywood silly costumes parades in the Swiss Alps.  I rate this movie a 10." 
" Good traditional cinema, showcasing family values.","If you are looking for a film with cabaret songs, women thrusting their body parts at the camera and men flexing their muscles, you are looking in the wrong place. However if you miss those days when you could take the FAMILY (that's including children) to the cinema or watch it at home, without keeping your finger constantly hovering over the fast forward button on your remote, then welcome to HSSH. This film is pure wholesome entertainment for the WHOLE family. Beautiful sets, emotional dialogues & uplifting music. This film has a happy-go feeling to it, it is very light and also gives you a lesson on family values. Some people are trying to compare it to Hum Aape Ke Hain Kaun, but i think this is not fair. HAHK is a love story, whereas HSSH is more on family life and social issues & morals. My advice to you would be, lay back, grab some popcorn and just enjoy a beautiful meaningful and moral film that may end up uniting you and your loved ones forever!" 
" wonderful movie for indian families","i have seen movie and bought video casette. we enjoyed the movie and felt this is a MUST see for every good family who believe in traditional values. It reminds of Ramayana. With modern values. It gives clear message about how to deal with family problems and how to control ego and how to develop let-go feelings within family members. We have preserved video just in case any dispute arise between family members, we will see the movie and get back normal unity. hats off for such a daring movie. it may be commercial failure. but these clean movies are welcome." 
" fantastic","I loved this film it just the right amount of substance of everything...The characters and acting was just what i needed to see.M. Bahl superb, S Khan, Great, SA Khan wonderful, K Kapoor Tremendous, S. Bendre Amazing TABU was great addition, I'm glad Madhuri did not star she would have spoilt it... Suttle all through this film so much emotion... love comedy anger fear happiness...Just the right balance.I loved Maine Pyar Kiya. Hated Hum aapke Hai Kaun. I Loved this film.Family saga with actors acting brilliantly thats rare in bollywood.. We usually stick a star or model in and let their name sell the movie but the actors have sold this movie. People like Shah Rukh Khan Madhuri Aishwaria would have made increased the revenue in the first day because of their status and their acting ability or lack of it would have sank it...When are we seeing the next oneI cant wait to see the original cast of Rajshiri Productions to do magic again I hope people of this films can be put in a film again..." 
" Abc Efg .... POO","First time sitting through this film, it was switched off after approx 10 minutes.Now 10 years later, it was switched off after 1 hour.The main problem is that the film centres around a family whose antics make the Waltons appear like the family from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Also everyone in the film including the Hatis and Ooots have a big grinning Yorkshire cat smile that never changes.The songs are lame including the 'abc' song. A double disc CD was produced for this!Overall - Switch it off" 
" Wise not to "stand united"!","Even though I am Indo-Caribbean and do like watching films just to connect with motherland,I do feel that we shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.We will make films like K3G and Lagaan bigger hits overseas than good films like Chandni Bar.I waited two years to get this because I wasn't interested and because it grossed $2 million in USA and films that gross over $300,000 get pirated the fastest.Mr Sooraj sure knows how to make the perfect formula.Put six attractive stars (and hide one) all over on trailors and posters and cd's and then only have Karishma Kapoor and Neelam (the hidden one) steal the show from the females Tabu and Sonali Bendre,which is disappointing because all four are talented,but Tabu only gets 12 lines and Sonali,probably 15.Then for our males...Salman Khan's name is first and he only gets 10 lines where Saif Ali Khan and Mohnish Behl steal the spotlight anyways.Even the supporting artiste get more lines and even the children get more scope,all Salman,Tabu and Sonali get to do is stand in the background and blush.Well, only two good tracks are 'Mere Hiwda Mein' and 'Maiya Yashoda'.It has a really good repeat value because I have seen it three times and if you like it,then you must not like films with high meaning like Lajja,Chandni Bar,Dil Se or Astivta,and Tabu won best actress awards for Chandni Bar and Astivta.Glad she was the first actress to do crossover into art films because she is not going to waste herself any longer in silly commercial masala!6/10" 
" Being together","I liked this movie.It is quite good.It is a nice feel good movie.The movie is so colorful.The story is quite confusing.It tells about Ram and his wife Mamta and there 3 sons and 1 daughter.Their 3 sons name is Vivek,Prem,Vinod.Vivek is the adopted one.Vinod is the youngest.One day on the wedding anniversary day completes a picture(I mean lot of characters).Vivek marries Sadhana.Later Prem is engaged to Sangeeta.Later Vinod is engaged to Sapna.Skip a long story.Later they all fight and are separated.The title is good and suits the story very well.Barjatyas story telling in this tale is wonderful and confusing.I liked the bond and there emotions were excellent.Mohnish does a great job.Salman did a great job too.Saif overacted in the first half but he did good in the second half.Tabu was great.Sonali was great,Neelam was good,Karishma was pathetic in an unusual role.Alok,Reema,Ajit,Rajeev and the others did good.The 3 Lady's which played Reemas friends were annoying.Himani was okay.tc.The cinematography is excellent and flawless.The music is great with excellent picturisations.One song "Yeh To Saach Hai"showcased Mohnishs character feelings very very well.Overall A good family movie Rating-7/10" 
" A Movie with a Message.","I like this film because it was a true family drama, and a dying genre, even in Hindi movies. The family relationships are well portrayed and often very touching even though they can run to the "too sugar sweet" area sometimes. But this is a very miner concern, because the bulk of the film has a great vibe and a great flow. The story advances with all the songs, instead of detracting from it. I think what a lot of people have forgotten to focus on is the social message conveyed in this movie. This movie explores the dangers of letting people poison your mind, and how family relationships can be badly effected by one person's wrong decision. The Mother in the story is made to feel insecure after the incident where the daughter's brother in law steals the family business from under them. This incident propels her to look at her own family in a different light, and to heed the machinations of 3 very frivolous women, and a man who wants to see his daughter lead the good life at all costs. The fact that they show us how well the family gets on before this incident shows us that regardless of how well you get on, such things can still happen to tear you apart. But the touching thing about this story is how the brother's and sister's rally together to protect each other, and how the firm love and respect between them swings things back into place. I loved this film. ALL the actor's contributed to the film. The characters they play are different, thus adding to the story in their own ways. I also disagree with another comment on this page that if you like this film you would not like films like "Astitva" and "Chandani Bar". I beg to differ. I liked those films very much. You don't have to be stuck in one genre, and it's better to be able to appreciate many genre's insteas of just one." 
" Almost Together","Sooraj Barjatya's Hum Saath Saath Hain is his follow-up to the immensely successful Hum Aapke Hain Kaun. Barjatya has pretty much all the same ingredients here as well. The ensemble cast are all perfectly selected for their roles and have done a good job. Most outstanding of all in the film would be Mohnish Behl. Barjatya has once again written a very meticulous script with great timing by all the artists in bringing out Barjatya's vision from the paper to the screen. The one area where HSSH lacks in is the music. Though not a bad score by any means, it needed a bit more melody and pleasantness to enhance the moods of the film better. Also, the energy that HAHK had somehow seems to be missing. But to be fair to the film, Barjatya has once again presented a very sincere and heartfelt effort. Job well done. 8/10."
