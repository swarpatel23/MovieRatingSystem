" A True Insult To Oldboy !!!","I can't believe they got the rights to crucify OLDBOY with this trash!!! I mean why bother... They have totally destroyed a cult movie of very high standard. The acting in this"effort" is shabby, the cinematography is amateur, the dialogue had me in stitches from start to finish. I found myself in tears of laughter at how bad this really was in every way possible.I think the most tickling moment is when they tried to re enact the "hammer" fight scene with a hugely inflated Sanjay Dutt - it was like seeing a hippo on speed - the original was one of the most memorable fight scenes ever choreographed but this was like a terrible outtake.I hope the actors and director of this nonsense look back at it and cringe with embarrassment because I certainly did.Hollywood have their crack at Oldboy released some time this year, I hope and pray it's not as bad as Zinda - one thing this film is not is Zinda for sure - its DEAD from the opening scene !!!" 
" Unbelievable","Warning: I'm a German-Japanese / Poor English Abnormally, i'd generally like to experience remade flicks. More so the if i loved the original. I know there are extremely few which equals or excels to the original but it's not a big problem for me 'cause i don't even expect them to. It is to me like a bonus track of a beloved album, no more no less.So i got no hesitation in checking Zinda as well (i was even excited actually) 'cause the original must be in my all-time best 10, but, oh my..I won't say any more about this XEROX COPY crap. (copied on retarded machine, moreover) Nough said by nough people.Now one thing i just can't believe is how this could be legal. As far as i've read on internet articles, Sanjay and his people haven't even paid a penny to the original Oldboy makers for doing this, which means Zinda is not an official remake of Oldboy. Then what the h..! is Zinda's identity? Some's gonna say it's JUST BASED ON or INSPIRED thing but you know it's way beyond those kinds. Then what? Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Sanjay and his company have hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads & reports or non-official comments. Instead, Sanjay's kept saying he's got a bit INSPIRED ONLY and Zinda is totally different from Oldboy or something like that. Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly copying scenes-by-scenes from Oldboy, Sanjay intentionally missed the KEY-POINT of Oldboy's story for his own audiences' taste, for COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words. Then how can we call it Homage anyway ? My conclusion is : Zinda is not only a copy crap, it's rather A CRIME, LITERALLY. I don't understand why Oldboy makers let them make money with this stolen thing.Am i disappointed ? No i'm fine i didn't even expect. I'm just p***ed and upset for this shitmakers' shamelessness that's all." 
" Zinda is now under investigation for violation of copyright.","It's not something new for bollywood to copy foreign movie's script. I guess they (actors, director and creative staff members...) all gather around and watch the movie to be copied so that there will be no confusion what they are really after. Frame to frame. That's a shameful act for any responsible main stream actors and director. I am glad that Zinda is now under investigation for violation of copyright. Its about time now to stop this shameful piracy. Another thing is, Hindi movie don't have guts to go that extreme like jaw-dropper "Old boy". Pathetic. They make movie according to the public taste, mostly rickshaw pullers. I wonder where they found in between the plot to plant some songs and crazy dance. Somebody really needs to tell bollywood artist that movie is a serious art business. There is a very bold thick red link between copy and adaptation, and Zinda is way far across the line." 
" xerox could have done a better job","The only reason this movie ended up with more as 1 star is because some hardcore nationalist bollywood lovers didn't write honest reviews. Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against remakes nor bollywood, but this is just uninspired crap. I like any kind of movies. But movies ought to be made by people who enjoy making them, they should be skilled. Willing to put effort in making a good movie. This guy is allowed to make movies because he is from a rich influential family. Sanjay Gupta must be one of the least talented directors these days. None of his work is original and all of his movies are cheap copies. this is the same, he saw a movie. Liked it, but just didn't understand it. it doesn't even come close to the original. Everything is just worse as the original oldboy. Camera work, story (that doesn't work out anymore) de fighting is lame, making it not offending for the Indian audience by cutting out the incest totally destroyed the story. The actor had to be a pretty face, too bad he didn't have acting skills with it. This untalented director shouldn't even be allowed to sell pop-corn in a cinema. Too bad mom and dad had money.Its a direct insult to the real oldboy, and Sanjay didn't even pay for the rights to rip it. Please don't watch it, get oldboy instead. This one will only make you vomit" 
" Product of a questionably loose Indian Copyright laws","Many have said this before, but I'm afraid I have to repeat the opinion on the account that a surprising many have decided that Zinda is worth of anything more than 1 star in IMDb. Zinda is a unscrupulous photocopy of the masterpiece Oldboy, and should be avoided, if not boycotted.Some will claim that Zinda is a 'tribute' or a 'remake' of the Oldboy. To them I ask one question: "What kind of filmmakers make remakes of a movie when the original came out two years ago and has been selling DVDs very well internationally?" It seems that this particular brand of Indian cinema has decided that it is quite content making money off of other people idea for free. And though it is impossible for the original filmmakers to sue the filmmakers of Zinda (on the account that Indian copyright laws does not allow for such suit), Zinda should be remembered as a true stain on the development of Indian Cinema.Because it has photocopied a great movie, Zinda avoids being an absolute terror of a movie. However, this does not excuse Sanjay Gupta and the section of 'Bollywood' that has involved itself in Zinda's production. Because of the blatant plagiarism, and the Zinda's makers absolutely refusing to apologize and reimburse the original filmmakers, I must say Zinda deserves 1 star, if not 0." 
" HOLY SH*T .......... I Have Encountered Satan's Porno !!!!","Zinda has psychologically poisoned me. Words refuse to escape my mouth as I am beyond speechless, what this world is capable of ..... looking at you "Bollywood". For Starters Oldboy is my all time favourite piece of cinema, a masterful art work, that I truly respect and admire. Zinda uses Oldboy and devours its reputation and spoofs it presumptuously. I've never witnessed something so putrid, this film is simply a crime. Zinda is an unforgivable sin. The cinematography was chaotic, the acting was horrific and the experience as a whole was intolerable. The producers should feel ashamed and beg for their dignity back. Zinda is humiliating to the point were I can't even comprehend. While my brain was decomposing as I tortured my self to sit through an hour and fifty minutes of utter garbage. This movie is one of a kind, nothing has made me seriously doubt the existence of life like this ever before. My lord what have I gotten myself into my brain thinks to itself for the millionth time in the first 30 minutes. WARNING this film cannot be unwatched so be careful and I mean it. I apologise on behalf of Bollywood for all the true Oldboy fans or even the people who just appreciate film. Because for some reason I feel guilty this *beeping* film exists." 
" A Thief Ought to be Jailed","Many people have said it. I feel it bears saying again. I am an Indian, and I am ashamed of Zinda. I don't care whether the cinematography is brilliant or not, whether the acting (acting? john abraham? really?) is great or not.... i say gimme enough money, and even i can cut, copy, paste from any classic, 'indianize' it, and make myself the newest hotshot director on the block. To those who say that Sanjay Gupta has done a good thing by bringing this kind of cinema to Indian audiences I have only one thing to say:If that sorry excuse for a human being (a.k.a Sanjay Gupta) really wanted Indian audiences to have access to good movies, he should have bought - BOUGHT Mr. Gupta, not stolen - the rights to make an official remake.What you have done is plain and simple stealing, and you ought to be treated like any ordinary thief.Oh, and in case you're wondering: Zinda as a stand alone movie is also crap. In Oldboy, one is never left feeling as if any threads are loose, that any part of the story is not explained. In Zinda, one is never convinced by any explanation given to cover up the gutless Gupta's substituting the incest storyline with his ham effort." 
" Remake (particularly bad one) of Korean Oldboy where a man is inexplicably held prisoner for fourteen years and only has four days to find out why","Bollywood should NEVER try to be as ambitious to tackle films like Oldboy. Indian morality eventually gets in the way. Such attempts are cringeworthy. Do not bother watching Zinda unless you like talentless 'eye candy' type films. Watch the original instead. What is it with Bollywood anyway? They shamelessly copy from oriental cinema/Hollywood and try to pass it off as their own. You can't help but feel disappointed. It was a massacre of the cultish Oldboy. You have to have a strong stomach to stomach some of the things that happen in Oldboy. Its like Bollywood was sugar coating the themes in Oldboy and what do you end up with? A version which your granny can watch with you without feeling too offended. If that was the case then Zinda should never have been made. Well it shouldn't have!" 
" Below average for a re-make","Most people who write reviews do so immediately after having felt the experience of the matter they are reviewing. I gave myself 48 hours before I decided to make what I wanted of about Zinda.To start with, Zinda is a remake of Chan-Wook Park's Korean masterpiece ''Oldboy'' which is the second movie in his trilogy of revenge movies. So, take that whole baloney of Sanjay Gupta being an original director and stuff and put it in the garbage because we have an other copy here.This is the official story of Oldboy in IMDb... ''An average man is kidnapped and imprisoned in a shabby cell for 15 years without explanation. He then is released, equipped with money, a cellphone and expensive clothes. As he strives to explain his imprisonment and get his revenge, he soon finds out that not only his kidnapper has still plans for him, but that those plans will serve as the even worse finale to 15 years of imprisonment.'' That's the story of Oldboy... that's the story of Zinda. It is a good plot, but Sanjay Gupta screwed it up.Sanjay Dutt is pathetic. He always tries to be larger than the story and therefore is practically invincible. First, why did Dutt have to be a s/w engineer in the film? S/w wasn't that big in 1991 that it could buy you a seaside house in Bangkok. Also, Shahrukh Khan was practically non-existent in 1991, when Manish's character tells that Dutt could be a better actor than the Khan. Come on, the intelligent viewer can do his/her math. Script writers..whither goes thou??? There were two of you!!! The entire sequence of Mr. Dutt in the cell is rather contrived and long. He was fed a single course mean twice daily for 14 years, and he didn't loose a single kilo. Puleeez.... this is a 2005 movie! Tom Hanks lost 15+kgs for Castaway and his character had more nutrition and exercise than Dutt's had. Not acceptable, Mr Gupta.The fight sequence with the hammer is unrealistic. Dutt is fighting Thai's who kick- box like we fart. He beats up people who are armed with knives and bats with a hammer and during the climax of the movie he fights almost the same people with a sword and they have swords at that time. This is like a Max Payne game.Lara Dutta magically appears as the Hindi speaking taxi-driver, who automatically assumes Dutt to be an Indian, whereas the enigmatic Dutt could easily pass off for an Arab. Dutt doesn't think to ask Dutta how she recognized him to be an Indian. Hmmm.... why we make such movies with weak scripts? Dutt-Dutta-Idiotta... I am getting a rhyme. Wheeee! OK... next! Why would a person who keeps people in cells for a living not have an in-house cook instead of buying food for years for his wards? It is more expensive and isn't good business. Is the director trying to tell us that Indians are lousy as businessmen? Manish Manjrekar was loud and boorish and I was happy to see him die.John Abraham cannot act. However, his character was the most credible.I can understand that a man can be made into a monster if he is held captive for 14 years for reasons undisclosed. But to be turned into a samurai??? With Director Gupta it is ... 'No problem!!!!' HA HA HA!!! Finally, not to forget, but we have Celina Jaitley who is also pathetic in her rather cameo role.Models should not act. This is an atrocity worse than Tsunami because more lives are being effected by the way they behave on screen.I won't waste too much time on the music. The Strings song is fantastic (as always). I have no clue why Dutt should appear in the video since his voice isn't there and all he does is play an imaginary guitar. Wait a minute, maybe it is because he produced the movie!!! Anyways, that's all I would like to say without ranting any more.I am really sad that my brethren are giving strong reviews about this movie. But then, beggars can't be choosers. Too bad Bollywood is making beggars of us when we have to choose between movies.Overall... give this a miss." 
" Holy sh*t...","... I totally agree with the previous comments, how can someone copy shameless a good movie AND took out the best scenes and best story elements? Oldboy is definitely one of the best movies (that's why it's good story copied that often), but when I try to copy something than I try to IMPROVE the copy, not to omit the best things! I'm sure the good voting only were given by people who didn't see the original movie.Please watch Oldboy - you will not waste your time. I really don't understand this Bollywood "Hype", bad actors, bad cinematography and a copied or other well known story - it's always the same. Finally I only recommend you to spend this 116 minutes of your valueable life with other things than watching this movie!" 
" Sunjay Gupta Copy Machine","This director hasn't made a lot of movies, but the following are his movies that are copied from the corresponding movie names: Zinda - Old Boy Musaafir - U-turn Kante - Resorvior Dogs Jung - Desperate Measures & Face Off Khauf - Juror I read somewhere on the internet that his Aatish, Hamesha, and Raam Shastra were also copied/inspired by some "hollywood" movies. I'm sorry if I'm too harsh on the guy, but he's a copy machine man. He's the copy machine sitting in Kinko's that does the crappiest copy for you and you loose your 10 cents and the time. Whats funny is that people are big fans of this director. They think he's making a difference to the Bollywood, well he may be, considering that bollywood creates ridiculous movies. But I mean come on, I did a little research on all the movies Sunjay Gupta made and they're all copies of one movie or the other. Thats nothing but ignorance. There is a movie director out there who does not realize that he lacks innovation and the ability to produce a piece of work on his own. Yet he claims that he is a director. Again, I will say what I say every time, I understand that people everywhere just want to make money the easiest possible way. If Americans here in Hollywood somehow figured out a way to copy something and make money off of it, they'd do it. But even remaking a copied movie takes about 80% of the effort. Thats why most of the Hollywood people just end up making something totally new. Why why why, why make a piece of crap out of something good and live with your head held up high. How can someone feel good after feeding a copied piece of crap to the Indian public and think that its the right thing to do. Well, I suppose they have to show the original to the producer as a prototype and then when the producer likes the original, he orders the director to make the exact copy. If thats how it works in Bollywood then I can safely say that Bollywood is way behind. But then again Sunjay Gupta was the director and producer of "Kaante", why did he copy that off of Resorvior Dogs, he didn't have to answer anyone there. That really proves that he is a no talent as s clown. Oh yeah, about the movie, Sunjay Dutt sucks, does pretty much the same thing in every movie. He is over confident and why shouldn't he be, all the low-esteemed and inferiority complexed people in South Asia, and even in some western countries idolize him. What better chance than this for Sunjay Dutt to cash his faky personality. If anyone can remember his conversation with Chota Shakeel that was out on the internet a while back they'll know what i'm talking about when I say faky personality. Someone said Lara does a great job as a babe, but not as a Punjabi cab driver, I agree. John Abraham is the worst successful actor possibly in the history of Bollywood. Along the same line as Salman Khan, but worse. There are flaws in the movie, specially when Sunjay Dutt fights those Thai guys with a hammer. No way a literally Old Boy like Sunjay Dutt could fight so many Thai guys like that. They would kick his u know what in 10 seconds I bet anything." 
" Not only a lack of concern, but it seems some actually see ripping off as a positive thing","I've read the user comments on this forum and found a blithe lack of concern in many of the posts for the fact that 'Zinda' is a total ripoff. Here are some telling examples, along with my own not-very-profound responses. I trust I need do no more than that to make my point:"It is unfortunate that bollywood ripped off OLDBOY, but if that is the only way that the Indian audiences would get a glimpse of what the original was like, so be it" (Huh? Ever hear of buying the rights to do an official remake?)"I am reading the reviews of OLD Boy too, which i have not seen. But I should say that it is a great experiment by Indian cinema" (Yeah, a repeat experiment -- like where somebody else first came up with the ideas and took the risks before you came along and decided to do the exact same thing)"The legendary action-scene with the hammer looks as hard as it was in Korean version". (the Korean version? Almost makes it sound like 'Oldboy' ripped off 'Zinda')"First things first , i haven't seen Old Boy so just cant judge Zinda by it's standard... He did full justice to the role of Balajeet Roy(on par with Choi Min-shik" (So you haven't seen 'Oldboy', but you HAVE seen Choi Min-Shik's performance in it? Do the police come to you for psychic impressions when they run out of clues?)(And what does this mean): "There is no doubt that 'ZINDA' is a complete rip-off of Korean movie 'OLDBOY' but I must add that it is an excellent adaptation of 'OLDBOY'".--And I won't spoil the pristine effect of these following remarks by adding my own commentaries:"Hollywood is also planning a rip of this one, so what's the fuss all about""People tell me that this movie is inspired/copied or total remake of a Korean masterpiece "OldBoy"; but I don't mind it""Yes agreed that he copies other films scene by scene, but who doesn't? Why is he called a copycat, when i can add a long list of other copycats? Take Ek Ajnabee - which was an exact copy of Man On Fire, or Vivek Agnihotri for Chocolate - which was a ridiculous version of the classic 'The Usual Suspects'. At least Sanjay Gupta makes a good replica of a film""Copy of old boy backed up with Sanjay direction makes it truly a ride you will never forget"."The story may be inspired from a Korean film, or so we are told, but is doesn't matter because no one's really seen it"." 
" zinda is brillian-s**t","What a great way for Bollywood to show how original they are. Wow i've never seen a movie that will make me cringe even more than this, unless Bollywood decide to remake the whole matrix trilogy, star wars trilogy, and LOTR trilogy and claim that the genius Indian directors and writers came up with the ideas. I would like to say as being a big fan of the Hollywood movies, Japanese movies and after watching oldboy a big Korean fan, that I am disgusted at the director and actors who decided to make this movie. How can you copy a great film and manage to destroy it piece by piece. Is the Indian director a fan of the original movie or an enemy? I think that Bollywood is brilliant at destroying original works of art. So how about sticking with throwing dye and dancing in the fields." 
" A sorry excuse of an Oldboy remake","Zinda is a truly god-awful film. The only aspect of the film that is moderately well done is the music.It's no wonder that the rating of this film is 3.5 less than Oldboy. The film changes the original film's plot a bit, and made it worse. It is in no way reminiscent of the groundbreaking visual style of Oldboy, and even the fight scene was shot poorly, trying to capture just the hero, while Oldboy's legendary corridor fight scene has the camera moving just left or right, and looks surprisingly realistic. The film's ending in particular made the film look like a bad joke. Oldboy's climax, while devastating and powerful, was delivered with almost no dialogue (where Oh Dae-Su flips through an album and realizes Mi-do was his daughter). Zinda, on the other hand, has some incredibly poor dialogue. "If you kill me you won't know where your daughter is." "Tell me where my daughter is." I mean, seriously? That's responded with one of the worst scenes that can come to my mind. "She is getting FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU" "NOOOOOOOOOOOOO" followed by alternating shots of the protagonist and the antagonist. Sanjay Dutt an John Abraham did a very mediocre job at acting their respective roles.Personally, I feel that Oldboy shouldn't have been remade in the first place (I don't have too high hopes for the 2013 Hollywood remake either) but Bollywood screwed up big time by making this laughable attempt at a remake." 
" Bad Remake Of A Korean Masterpiece","Zinda,a Hindi word means Alive, is a story of a man named Bala, who was locked up for 14 years and then was released. The film was about his plan for revenge and finding out the reason why he was imprisoned for many years. Just like the Korean masterpiece, it dealt on the subject of revenge. But unlike it, "chickened out" from it subject of incest and suicide as well as the sex,violence and goriness that the Korean film is known for. And obviously, there are no "eating a live octopus" scene involved. LOL Aside from that, the Bollywood film was your BELOW AVERAGE mystery/thriller. The characters have no depth whatsoever. Bala, played by Sanjay Dutt, is your typical good guy while Rojit Chopra,played by John Abraham,was your typical bad guy. Aside from that, the acting was below average especially Sanjay Dutt, whose Bala should be similar to Oh Daesu, does not appear to be convincing at all on his portrayal of a wounded man. Also, the movie was predictable from beginning to end. The only bright spot in the film is the mesmerizing beauty of the former Miss Universe 2000, Lara Dutta, who played as Jenny Singh. But overall, the movie ended how it was suppose to finish. A happy ending!!!!For lovers of good movies, skip this one!!!!And for Bollywood fans, don't bother watching this one!!!!" 
" 2006 Annual Follywood Crap-o-Remakes Starts With Huge Thunderous FART","OK, first off, this movie should be renamed to MURDA (dead).Seeing this film's previews earlier on, and with Sanjay Dutt's comments that he plays a very complicated character, it had everything going for it until it suddenly became clear that its a ripoff of a recent Korean movie, Oldboy. Boy, are they fast, and getting faster each year.The main character has been imprisoned without explanation for 15 years and when he's released, they are out to get him again. He bumps into a female cabbie of Indian origin (how convenient!). But before we get too far ahead  why the hell is this chappy living in Bangcock in the first place? Can't he get whatever it is he wants in India?? Such seemingly simple but completely *necessary* questions keep popping up repeatedly, the profound answers to which somehow keep eluding us. Confusing script yeah?!? Thats happens when you have no insights into the original.Well, someone got a bloody bit of explaining to do is what it is. You can't expect much by way of direction knowing it is a remake after all. No flashes of inspired brilliance here, just plain old photocopying. In the overacting dept, Sanjay seems playing to the gallery. The sidekicks had no great parts to play. Fight sequences are OK and only 2-3 scenes are worth the money.All in all, an avoidable fare and can be awaited on cable/DVD."
