" Neha Dhupia is suddenly stunning...","One expects a lot of sex and exposure from a Neha Dhupia vehicle post Julie, and for once, the hype doesn't disappoint. She didn't look all that great in her debut vehicle Qayamat, but here, she not only stuns with her finely tanned look, but tears up her femme fatale role with some decent acting chops. The glimmer of talent seen in Julie (when she was actually acting as opposed to getting felt up by two disgusting male costars) is still present. Sonu Sood is a good match for tall, dusky Dhupia and cuts a finely sculpted physique, which is more than I can say of Yash Tonk or Sanjay Kapoor. He plays second fiddle to Dhupia (who plays good girl/bad girl in a double role), but the two share some remarkable chemistry. The sexual tension is adequately built up and, for an erotic thriller with little/no/implied nudity, the movie's fairly absorbing. The story is rather pedestrian, but if you can overlook that, you'll enjoy the chemistry between the two leads, the stylish flair, and dark ambiance of the mystery. Indian noir...who'd have thought?" 
" Could have been better","In 2005, Neha Dhupia was hot property with filmmakers trying to cash on her sex symbol tag, Also Sonu Sood was trying to get launched as a lead hero, both resulted in Sheesha(2005). The film was directed by Ashu Trikha who gave us Deewanapan(2001). Sheesha tells a story of Twins Neha Dhupia, one who can't speak nor ear and the other a normal girl falling for Sonu Sood. Yet again it's a story of obsession which we have seen before but yet it does sound interesting but sadly it falters. The film is a remake of Vaali, A tamil film however which has a reverse story of 2 guys after 1 girl. Sheesha starts off well, but there are lot of flaws like the cop doubting on Neha after her earring is found near a dead body? Also several other The climax too is not too convincing and predictable Direction is decent, the director handles several scenes well, however his focus is a lot on sex which could be avoided and hope he had concentrated on the script Music is decent, Yaar Ko Maine and Mujhe Jeena Sikha Do are the best songsNeha Dhupia tries hard and is okay in both roles, quite a challenging role for her, as she was 2 film old, however she needed to brush her acting skills, thank god she has come a long way now as a n actor at least Sonu Sood is passable, he has come a long way too now and got famous though not as a lead Late Vivek Shauq provides some humour though its unnecessary at times rest are okay" 
" Neha does it again!","Neha Dhupia once again successfully carries the entire film on her shoulders. In Julie, backed up by an extraordinary script, she pleased the audiences. Once again in Sheesha, she is gifted another good story to enact. The story is new and different. Neha plays a double role as twin sisters, one of whom is deaf and mute. Shockingly, in her sister's absence, the "handicapped" girl behaves strangely and tries to seduce her sister's boyfriend. A psychiatrist explains this odd behavior very interestingly by saying that such a person accumulates stress/energy by not being able to release it through mediums such as music and conversation. This leads up to an extreme release of energy either positively or negatively. Unfortunately, in this case, it is negative to the extent of being psychotic. A very interesting storyline, a powerful performance by Neha, and shocking scenes make this an interesting and entertaining movie. Exotic locales and the fresh stars add to the rejuvenating feel of the film." 
" Neha Dhupia's Rack In An Evil Twin Movie!!","OK, let me start by saying that the film delivers on every count it is publicized to deliver---- there is a smoking hot heroine in the form of Neha Dhupia, she has a killer body, displays enough flesh to render this movie almost soft pornographic, there are some seriously deep and passionate lip locks and smooches, and the music is pretty pleasant to the ears. In fact, she is in a double role, so that is enough to satisfy any hot blooded male's wildest threesome fantasy. Neha is young and has a well toned, curvaceous body that stays in your imagination long after the movie is over, if you know what I mean. The story is basically a remake of countless evil twin movies, but watch it solely for Neha's smoldering body ad sex appeal!Also, the songs and the bikini number are worth the price of the ticket. Check out the luscious display of her mammary region as she tries to seduce Sonu Sood in a scene! Quite titillating." 
" Great popcorn movie","Neha Dhupia is a sport to watch in this movie. She is all spiced up and the director has spared no effort. She looks great in the hot scenes and the chemistry is perfect for building up sexual tension, but the emotional scenes are total loss. She needs to work in those areas. Her car wash scene makes you go gaga over her. Her voluptuous figure is very accommodating to the required scenes of this movie. As a person I have no idea how she is, but if she is as good as the looks I can bet her boy-friend/husband will never buy a lottery ticket. The rating is 7 for only Neha. The 3 stars are removed for lack of any emotions on her face during extreme scenes and the third class photography of a few places. The story is super pedestrian. It is even simple than turning a door knob. The actions scenes are an apology too. It is the movie a good watch: hell yes, 70% of it is all sexy Neha."
