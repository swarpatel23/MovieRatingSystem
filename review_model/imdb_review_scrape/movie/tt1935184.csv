" Thrilling but typical stuff only","Nakshatra is a cool thriller movie. I doubt if it released here in Bangalore, but nevertheless it's OK to watch on DVD.Story is about an aspiring script writer who gets involved in a Jewel robbery he does not commit, with an efficient cop behind him to nab him.The good - Storyline is good, songs are alright but not the limelight of the film, some stunts are remarkable, the climax is unexpected.The bad - The first half of the film is draggy, the only "standard" actors are Milind Soman and Anupam Kher, some degree of overacting on part of the actors, 2 item songs that were unnecessary, some sequences in the film remain unexplained.Also it has mostly the same old traditional stuff found in bolly movies- a hero and heroine,a "bada dilwala" type man,the hero trying to locate culprits in dance bars, some songs, some exaggerated stuff like " a very very precious diamond", the good and bad guys...you'll know if you watch.But Nakshatra nevertheless is worth. Try it" 
" What a waste.","This movie started quite well but before it could set in the story it went down from where it never came up. As the movie approaches to set the thrill you get the clear idea what the movie is all about. I wonder why Mr. Anupam Kher and Mr.Milind Soman did this movie. The good thing about the movie is, it makes you can feel as the director of the movie because every single scene is predictable. There are many funny and stupid things in the movie an anti-virus that can block any kind of virus, using a Mac but not enough proficiency to type a document. This movie reminds me of some 90's movie where a hero found guilty of something he didn't do and now a runaway convicts who tries to prove his innocence using science in the 20th century, its horrible."
