" A Gripping Hinglish feature","This New york based movie has all the masala of a Bollywood movie - Yet it stands out on its own. A complete new treatment compared to a Bollywood feature that is highly gripping... especially the second half is a mix if good unpredictable surprises. It is a well directed feature with a great style in narration. Start: Bauli Shah who played Xavier is seen holding a placard that states "Bomb here". Flash backs to why and how he ended with Bomb sign. How Sonia (Pragathi) with the help of Dev (Adnan) and Xavier keeps getting into the Ooops trouble scenarios and how it ultimately goes towards the super climax is the best part. Among the lead actors Buali's character is the best; Pragathi refreshes with a variety of her talents be it acting or dancing; Adnan and Gideon have a good presence; Rest of the cast are apt for their roles. The villain played by Jenner has a very towering menacing presence. This movie is a must watch for its style of narration and a very different approach from the typical Bollywood features." 
" Best Part is the movie .....UNPREDICTABILITY!","Unquestionably one of the smartest films I've seen recently, the biggest strength is its unpredictability. The film's biggest accomplishment is the manner in which it compels you, the viewer to think differently – midway through the film you begin to expect the unexpected and keeps you involved through out. The cast is an unusual ensemble of non-names that look very professional. The Songs are very melodious but seems a bit out of place in trying to meet Bollywood songs requirements. The Director must definitely be inspired by movies like Pulp fiction and has managed to create his own style of Bollywood Fiction." 
" Ooops - Brains Needed","Bollywood super hit films work on the premise 'keep your expectations low and you can tolerate the nonsense'. However Oops a Desi is a rare cinematic experience as far as Bollywood goes. It does not follow any Bollywood pattern and is a brave effort to give it the look it has. It's narration style ventures into unexplored territories of unpredictability not been seen in a while. Its like an anti-climax repeated several times. It keeps your brain cells on the toes and you better not sit back and relax if you don't want to appear dumb after wards. The performances have been superb and still it manages to have its own humorous moments as well. The only people who could end up hating this movie are folks who have very short attention span. For the rest of the movie goers this is a good engrossing watch." 
" A classic in disguise","This movie is a hidden gem that can easily be lost in the Star-blotted Big studio Bollywood releases churned out every weekend. Caught this movie by accident and was blown away by the no-nonsense non-traditional approach this movie has adopted. This movie has no known names from the industry but still everyone stands out with incredible screen presence. Here the director has obviously tried to juggle too many production roles (as seen with most independent features) but still managed to pull of the act. The drawback of the film is there is no breather to relax; yes a couple of good catchy songs are thrown in but it does not give you the break from the sub-plots that keeping pulling you in. If you are a fan of movies with various sub-plots intersecting into the main plot and keep you on the edge of the seat guessing what will happen next; then this movie should not be missed." 
" Entertaining","Ooops a Desi is a nifty 2 hour entertainer. Comedy is HILARIOUS! This movie is totally filmed in United States. Interesting fact about the movie is its narration. The story is told in a new fashion and Jenner Jose created a trademark with his new style of narration. There are very few directors who delineate story in their own style like Ram Gopal Varma, Anurag Kashyap etc and Jenner Jose falls in this category. It is hard to put the plot in few lines as the movie has several threads running parallel which are interlinked with one another. Focal points of the movie include well written dialogs, good actors, melodious songs and good cinematography. Buali Shah and Adnan Khalid were good. Pragathi Yadhati was stunning and looks like a blend of Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra. Negative points are the background score was not great, no emphasis on sentiments, fast pace that audience might get lost if they don't pay attention. I am giving excellent rating because some of the scenes made me laugh so hard, it is light heartening. Airport is heart touching. If you wanna have fun with friends, it is a good watch." 
" An Exhilarating and Engrossing movie","Jenner's film is an engaging, energetic, and gripping journey that should please the people looking for a no nonsense kind of entertainer. The film is set in New York and surrounding areas on illegal Indians and some of the issues they face before jumping into the thriller aspect of the movie. Jenner's execution and directing style is flawless without resorting to cliché Bollywood treatment. Hats off to Jenner for daring to take a risk with a non-star cast; with Bollywood stars this film would have rocked the Box-office for sure. The new comers have done their best and have a very credible future. The songs are entertaining.. the Running Song and final group dance in NYC when the credits roll." 
" Best Bollywood - Hollywood combo","Thrill-a-minute kind of Bollywood movie that needs brains to figure out the plot. Everything is not spoon feed to you like a brainless Bollywood feature that the audience have got so used to. Best part of the movie is the gripping screenplay and direction. Plot wise it is very gripping and is a roller coaster ride of twists and turns. Has a Hollywood flavor to the movie because of the usage of English at many places and American actors. Songs are also a plus. The running song Daud is pictured jumping through structures and has a very energetic feel. This movie is a must watch for those with brains. Rest can skip it."
