" Tashan Rocks","I just saw Tashan.Why do you guys who says this movie is bad? This movie is cool.Some d**b f*** critics compared it with Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag.Either they have not seen Aag or Tashan.I saw both of them.Aag is the worst movie I have ever seen.It was a complete disaster in every department.Cult classic Sholay did not receive such a punishment.As in the case of Tashan, it is 1 billion times better than Aag.It is not for intellectuals or for people looking for a solid script.The truth is the script is as old as the hills.But the movie is not boring.Not even for a nano second.The credit goes to the four main actors(Akshay,Anil,Saif and Kareena delivered superb performances.),the dialogues,the songs(Tashan Mein and Dil Dance Maare rocks), the choreography, the sets, the background music the action scenes and the pace of the movie.The action scenes could have been better. Also the henchmen of Anil Kapoor were ridiculous.The movie would not have been half as entertaining without Akshay.You will love his character.A wannabe shooter with a heart of gold.He is the soul of the movie.A perfect weekend movie.Just sit back and enjoy.NB: Maybe I should also say that you have to be an Akshay Kumar fan in order to enjoy the movie.I am one.For the past 14 years" 
" Tashan...did everyone fail to read the Tagline..?","I won't call myself a pro, or even anywhere close to a pro when it comes to movies, though I am an absolute freak. I tend to watch movies for what they are.. and am very happy to say more often than necessary that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and how good a thing it is that I am entitled to mine. Generally,I am not a huge fan of Hindi movies. They often lack originality and tend to get overtly pretentious, as in, always pretending very hard to be what they are not. SADLY enough audiences of Hindi movies are so foiled and shaped by now, to this sad sad story, that when a movie actually is what it says it is and hits them in the face with it, THEY TAKE OFFENCE! TASHAN is exactly what it says it is..The style..the look...the formula! It is a movie that has every clichéd formula ever invented solely in Bollywood. The traitor and villainous Antagonist, murdering the true kingpin and taking care of the King pin's orphan with bad intentions of course, armed with clichéd dialogue,Horrible accent, and inferiority complex too. The Beautiful babe who is a slippery vixen with revenge on mind and seduction as a second nature. The "Accha" guy, who is straight as an arrow, "izzat bachanay wala", hard on the outside, soft and mushy on the inside and yes an exceptionally good fighter bulletproof unless in love. Then the outsider who is unknowing of the ways of the crime-world, lured into the middle of the whole thing only to understand that the whole game stands on his shoulders. The Bachpan ki mohabbat, the heroine ki "chaalbaazi", the villain ki "neeyat kharabi"..the goons , the guns, the knives. The whole frigging formula! Someone said before me that the movie is ahead of its time..it surely is, people still believe in all of real films that invented these formulas to not find them funny when they are mocked so loudly. Performances are super bollywood class! Anil Kapoor is perfect. Akshay Outdoes himself. Saif is truly jazzy and Kareena is the perfect femme fatale, she is perfectly wearing the skin of her character as is everyone else. She looks lovely, though I like her better with her original body size. The locations, the cinematography everything is great except some flaws in the special effects section, but dare I say that that is also more like staying in character of Bollywood films..ALWAYS LESS THAN CONVINCING SPECIAL EFFECTS. Music is delicious as well as very original. The best thing in the end I would say for sure is the TASHAN of it all that ties it together nicely. For me it Turned out to be really fun. For a neutral watcher Tashan is all that it says it is...please read the tag-line, grab some popcorn and enjoy this true bollywood joyride of a stylish spoof. Its Amar Akbar Anthony meets Racey Dhoom...and all that came in between." 
" Tashan has guts","Let me tell you whether you like or hate Tashan, the fact is that this is a movie unlike you have ever seen in India or anywhere else. Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on what you went into the theater expecting.Also the point of this post is not as much as to review the movie but more to explain what Tashan was supposed to be. After that it's your call to decide if it's a good, average or pathetic movie. This was a movie which I watched for free on very first day of its release courtesy the firm I am having my summer internship with. So in absence of all the reviews that were supposed to come out the very next day, my experience and feelings while watching this were quite unbiased .Since then a lot has been said about the movie. It has been called amongst the 'worst movies ever","idiotic and silly","formulaic" and even been given nicknames like "aditya chopra ki aag". OK I understand the movie is no classic but it certainly is not as bad as being said. I am a sort of person who hated movies like Dhoom 2 and Dus. The reason being that these pretended be cool and stylish but actually were just plain annoying and dumb ,and the hate is so strong that even this post will be reeking of the same. Tashan is a movie which actually shouts out loud that look how silly I am. It is very honest in what it wants to be and what it's supposed to be .Take it or leave it. It is not at all meant to be serious, believable or intellectual cinema. It is meant to be a sort of a spoof and homage to the masala potboiler Hindi cinema of 70s and 80s. If you have seen Quentin Tarantino and Roberto Rodriguez directed Grindhouse then you will understand what I am talking about. This is the reason why everything in the movie is deliberately over the top situations, characters, dialogs, action, dance sequences (e.g. dil dance mare) and everything else. The whole mood of the film can be summed up in one song -Dil dance mare which has been outrageously choreographed and actually in a good way with lyrics which are really very innovative. The reason why this movie is attracting so much hate is because it tries to mock the same audience and critics who think Dhoom 2, Dus, Krrish, Race etc are good movies. Todays multiplex going audience who think of themselves as 'intellectuals' feel almost insulted of the fact that they have been presented with a movie which has supposedly been phased out of their theaters ( i.e. rickshawallahs type b grade cinema of 80s). These audience can bear a song like 'zara zara touch me' but cringe at 'dil dance mare'. But that is what I like about Tashan- a no holds barred, unpretentious and unapologetic bollywood ishtyle masala fare. It's the same old tale of revenge and love that has been told umpteen numbers of times but jazzed up for the 21st century. While action sequences in Dhoom 2 kept annoying me and dialogs put me to sleep, the dialogs and conversations in Tashan are actually quite interesting with that completely gone crazy mix of Hindi and English. Tashan is no more or less silly compared to Dhoom 2 and Dus but actually has much better performances. Akshay Kumar is brilliant as Bachhan Pandey and Anil Kapoor is good in first half. That being said it's not a very good homage and the film falters badly in second half with unnecessary subplots and stretched out action sequences which reach a level of craziness that is almost surreal. Also the storyline fails to hold your interest after a while.If you are ready to suspend your sense of belief for a couple of hours, sick of current crop of 'multiplex' movies and actually understand that its all meant to be hyper realistic you may will find some redeeming qualities. I will rate it 2.5/5. Not good but still better than other pseudo cool and insult to intelligence movies like Dhoom 2 and Dus. Don't waste your precious bucks in a theater for this, rent a DVD and find out yourself how good or bad this movie is." 
" It will take time for Indians to watch a multiplex movie","Sorry,everybody who choose movie bad and good according to the box office status.I am very sorry for them who watch and comment on movies.Bur the actual thing is that they don't know anything about cinema and the labor behind making cinema.If everything goes right then Mera Naam Joker will be hit as Shakti,Sadma...........and the list is too long to write. But one thing is sure they will feel that they know about cinema. They will raise question about our movies are not getting Oscars. Then guys please watch any foreign movie that got Oscar. But please with some intelligence you will never be doubtful over this question. Have you guys watched movie Draculla in comically presented in Hollywood. Please watch it you will find what Tashan is all about. This is a genius. Everything is brilliant except proper marketing. Those who rejected Tashan made Om Shanti Om super hit (the years biggest hit) as well as Main Hoon Na. I have no complained over those movies. They were also brilliant but properly marketed by Saharukh Khan. The thing I want to say is that Tashan is a pure homage to 80's Masala Bollywood movies where Dharmendra can jump over 10 stored buildings, a canny man like Rajkumar can defeat tones of villains with great body by slapping only. The same critics' applause that made them intellectual best. So my dear audience never judge at your point view but you have no idea of film-making art. Sadly speaking a good movie is proved a good movie when it declares as hit. Tashan is by far the best movie I have seen these days. Just imagine Bijay Krushna Acharya is a fool who made this action movie no my dear he assumes that our Indian audience has improved a lot they can understand the theme of the movie which is parody of all Masala Bollywood movies of 80's ." 
" Trash(y) 'Un? NOT! (revised review)","If there was any doubt after Dhoom 2 that Yash Raj films was in a steep downward spiral, that has now been removed. Tashan is as low as it can get. IMDb does not allow rating lower than 1 - otherwise I suspect this one would be in the negative column.The story/plot - the threadbare plot boasts of a couple of twists that are laughable, and in fact it is all ishtyle (if you think tacky is the new ishtyle) and lacks any substance whatsoever. If there ever was supposed to be any connection between the events unfolding on screen (why eggzactly was Bhaiyyaji learning Einglis?), it was unclear and to tell you the truth I did not care! The dialogs were nightmarish - even Bhiayyaji's Hinglish became painful and incoherent as Anil Kapoor valiantly tried to stay in the mode.The acting - oh well, who cares, it was all about ishtyle anyway. So let us just discuss that. Bhaiyyji (Anil Kapoor) had a certain ishtyle as the villain of old tradishun, Akki was the usual Ishtyle of the tasteless Tradishun (that was actually the only effective ishtyle in this film), Saif had the pathetic Ishtyle of a "cool dude" who sports a droopy mustache (now how many cool dudes can do that?), and Kareena had the size zero figure ishtyle - sadly the size zero removed all the b (as in booty) from her assets - minus boobs and butt she was almost androgynous. Oh, I should mention that none of these Ishtylish folks actually acted.The music was ONLY thing that was worth mention in this film. Songs are catchy, and the picturization of Dil Dance Maare was interesting. For the rest - the story was unhappily chugging along when BOOM there was an unconnected song and dance routine.The last 20 minutes took the film to a new nadir, unimaginable depths of dross. I HOPE AND PRAY THAT THIS FILM BOMBS. I have nothing against the studio or the cast (in fact I quite like Saif and Kareena), but if this film works then action movies will never be the same again and I will have to stop watching Hindi cinema that is action oriented. Seems a bit harsh but my mind is still reeling from the fact that hundreds of men with machine guns could not take out 3 people, these hundreds miraculously lost their guns, then there was hand to hand combat of the martial arts kind, there was a flame thrower, and it all culminated in a very big water hose and a jet ski doing a dry run! I thought Hritik's shooting out of the gutter act was bad and now I have been proved so completely wrong.Trashun is one pathetic piece of trash that needs to be swept out and sent to a landfill immediately. I CANNOT BELIEVE I WROTE THAT!!!I had the good fortune to view this one again on DVD - I humbly wish to revise my opinion.We have a film that is truly unique in concept, shows small time people realistically, and even does a pretty good job of showing their ambitions and yearning to be "superior" - just like Jarj Bus! There is the excitement of a heist or sorts, chases galore, a pretend romance, and a real one that started during childhood (Devdas anyone?), a baddie villain, and cop who is sort of villainous, and lots and lots of action. Add to this the fact that we have one of the best roles ever done by a major superstar - yes Akshay Kumar. Kya entry Thi Aur Kya finish! We have a heroine who looks great and is full of guts and gumption - she will avenge the wrongs done to her family and she needs no one to help her do that, and she will put scruples aside just like a man! We have 3 lead men and the most amazingly different item song in Dil Dance Maare. What went wrong? My initial take on the film was that it was complete Bakwaas (watching films online does NOT help). But it was still strangely attractive to me and I broke down and got the DVD. Wah Bhai Wah. Music rocks, Akshay delivers his life's best acting, Kareena looks yummy (except in that size zero bikini), Saif is adequate. Anil Kapoor is one negative - he speaks Bhaiyya speak well early on, but gets totally incoherent as the film proceeds, and I think the audience was not ready for the spoof filled action sequences. This is one film that deserves a look - for Akshay, for Kareena, for Dil Dance Maare, and Falak Tak (magical moments on screen) and for the streets of Kanpur and Akshay's entry. The best performance by any lead actor this year. You can fast forward Chaliya and Dil Haara but the rest is very very watchable. I hope the makers do not take the film's failure as a huge negative signal - Tashan was ahead of its time and will end up as a cult film of sorts." 
" funny, stylish, i loved it","I totally disagree with the ratings and think that its not justified. though the movie had its good and bad parts overall the movie is in fact very good. On the negative side the action scenes were totally unrealistic, totally clichéd where our main leads are showered with bullets but escape without a scratch while bad guys and pathetic side actors fall like a bunch of leaves in autumn. But on the positive side the acting was really great especially by Akshay Kumar, Kareena looked smoking hot, Saif, though not a significant role, did good justice to his part and last but not the least Anil Kapoor who was brilliant with his bihari hinglish. The music is top notch with lots of catchy songs. I really think the positives far outweigh the negatives of this movie. If you really want to watch a movie which is funny, stylish and added to that some amazing music and cinematography then you cannot miss this movie." 
" An Enjoyble movie.","I read the critics reviews of the movie, and the report didn't scare me to watch it in the cinema...and Iam glad I saw it.The movie is a well done movie, the story could have been stronger, but the effects and camera work is Super.Akshay Kumar is the best in the movie, and specially the way the fighting scenes have been choreographed was a delight to watch.Kareena Kapoor is good,but she is too thin now..it doesn't suit her to look so skinny just cause of a Bikini scene...but her acting was good.Saif was good too..And Anil Kapoor was OK.All in all, forget the critics and go watch the movie." 
" Biggest Flop of 2008.... Don't even dare to watch on DVD","This is the biggest Flop of 2008. I don know what Director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster. The songs have been added without situations, the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people. Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish... Akki is also done a good job.... But the movieee just forget it." 
" BAD BAD movie....","Such a long awaited movie.. But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day.. From the trailers it looked like a action movie, but it turned out to be a out & out comedy(a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors, they've done their part of the movie very well. Good acting, but i don't think that can save the movie.. India has been shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) were all saturated with color, alright. Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-)Action sequences were shot very shabbily, no one could make out head & tail of the stunts, they've used Akki(akshay kumar) very well but could've been done much much better..Animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies(90's movies had better animation scenes i guess(initial scene where the car is falling off 'flying should be better word' the road into lake).And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins, just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name i guess.." 
" Tashan: If you thought Rudraksh was bad, think again!","I would have liked to write about the story, but there wasn't any. I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but "hinglish" is only funny for like 5 minutes, after that its overkill. I would have liked to swoon over the 'keep-u-guessing suspense' but it was as predictable as... um mm, a Yash raj movie (?). I would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action, but I don't like cartoons much. *sigh*All in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people attempting suicide - I promise it'll push you over the edge 2. Sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da-Vinci code wore. 3. People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4. Movie Piraters: More power to them. If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers. Afterthought: The director of the movie, obviously, is a species of his own. ( And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind..one is enough)Things that could have made this a better movie: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Screenplay writer 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (Did I already say that?) 6. A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who was challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor=Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8. A statutory warning - "Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health" ?Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2. The English sub-titles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" becomes - "My heart is in a void" , "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" turns into "Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond" ..priceless.In short, Tashan to me, is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player, Tashan promises to lower your IQ, and that.. in a mere 2.5 hours! Woot!*sigh*..But thats just me. I could be wrong You've been warned anyways."

" The Ishtyle... The Goodluck... The Pharmoola.. A parrfect mix...!!!","Now this.. it's back to the old school.. where they made movies for pure entertainment.. Call it cheesy.. call it over the top.. call it what you will.. This movie ranks up there or higher above the old cheese which became silver and golden jubilee hits... It just grabs you from the start and sucks you in all along with the corniness, cheesiness and sheer colours of great action, music and star presence..This is one movie that left me satisfyingly entertained in a long long long time! No brainwork required.From Anil's corny comic yet violent gangster to Akshay over the top superhuman actions in fight scenes to the sexiness portrayed by Kareena and Saif's coolness.Go watch this!! Just in the frame of mind you would cheesy spaghetti actioners like Dharam Veer, Sholay and others in that line.." 
" Don't waste your time","The worst movie I have seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, no humor, no nothing! The action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up advertisements stitched together. Heavily influenced from The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle but very poorly executed.I did not go a lot of expectations, but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder "What were these guys thinking??!!".The only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini.The reason why I did not give a rating of '1' is that every time I think I have seen the worst, Bollywood proves me wrong." 
" Outrageously Stupid","this has got to be the most horrifyingly stupid movie ever made in the history of film making.........no story, wafer thin plot, loud, garish, SENSELESS, and not to leave out - UNREALISTIC, are some of the main characteristics of this movie.... !!!!!!! please don't spend any money on this movie, it seriously does not deserve it. the only and I mean ONLY good part of this movie is Kareena Kapoor in a 2 piece....... she looks HOT !!! thats it........anil kapoor is Irritating, to say the least. akshay kumar is OK and does manage to raise a coupla laughs.....saif ali khan has been wasted, actually I don't know how he agreed to do this role as a sidekick." 
" Tashan sucks from top to bottom....","I had some expectation for the movie, since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic. When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way. Well, the very first scene itself pis*ed me off. Then, the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are.The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies.Well, the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this one.And for that, I give a rating of 2 out of 10.Guys, please..please...don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes.Thats all." 
" Very good masala movie","Most of the people who found the style, dialog etc in the movie as weird, they are mostly those who do not understand that different region in India has different styles, different problems, and different ways of dealing with them and they try to pretend their ignorance as knowledge./* Possible Spoiler in the next paragraph */ I really started liking the Writer/Director Vijay K Acharya. e.g. most of the people will ignore the fact that Bacchan Pandey was electricity 'chor' as some irrelevant thing in the story, but it is actually not. In Kanpur, the city of Bachchan pandey, electricity comes 5-8 hours a day on an average. If you cannot digest just this simple fact, then you cannot digest the movie for sure."
