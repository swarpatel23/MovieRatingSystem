Mrityunjay, a perfect Gama in several senses is yearning for a girlfriend which he knows he cannot find in real life log ins to a dating site and ends up miserably as his body parts are taken out by a well managed human organ traffickers.Then, this lady Vandana, who was enjoy everything in life, unnecessarily creates problems for herself and doubts her husband and then coned by her friend and her friend's boyfriend and ends up miserably.The third character 'Mondal' is a typical BPO guy who spends a lot and earns less, always in financial mess. Tries duping credit card owners but as happens, these things do not continue for long, dies in the end as he tries to escape from police who actually did not come to catch him but to investigate Mrityunjay's murder.Best part in the movie is stories, that you will see happening a lot these days. You can also relate with the characters, you might have seen many of them in your real life." 
" This is a highly underrated movie of Indian film industry","I have seen this movie few days back and believe me, I had least expectation with this movie and I was very satisfied and thought provoked after watching this flick.It shows bitter reality and above all, it's flow was very smooth and not a single moment, this movie was boring. I thoroughly enjoyed it and not only enjoyed but really felt each story.Really, the director of this movie is a brave man but I know as it was a low budget movie with unknown faces, no one cared to see it. Even the people who claims that they loves different type of movies gave very low response to this movie & I am sad about it.Do not go on star caste, do not go on budget, and do not go on publicity as publicity sucks in many cases. Just see this movie once and you will not curse me for that."
