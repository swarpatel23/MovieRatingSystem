" GR8 Piece of Entertainment","j2m2 is an excellent movie with great special effects and excellent storyline basically it kinda copies "The adventures of Gulliver" but still as all the Indian movies copy some movies or the other e.x (kyunki main copies liar liar) (TATHASTU copies JOHN Q) and (partner copies hitch) so this movie has somewhat the same plot, the actors taken in the movie weren't that big, but the movie was made nicely, it used great VFX and great Cinematography, so please whoever didn't watch the movie please watch it as it is a great piece of film making by the bollywood film industry, and the actor JAVED JAFFERY has done great work in this movie, he was really entertaining, and JHAMUNDA was scary too" 
" Not a good movie","Because it is from India, it makes up for the really bad cgi horrible rip off of Gulliver's travels and lots of roars. Not worth the price I paid. It was a rip off. Even the kids wont enjoy this one. I bought it in China for a dollar. I want my dollar back. The only benefit is being able to mock it mystery science theater 3000 style. I didn't think it was possible to find a movie worse than cabin boy, but this is it. It is two hours of my life that I want back... But then again, if I were drunk this might actually be funny. It does have it's random rock video moments. The mermaid is just ridiculous. You could blind someone with that beard! The plot from power rangers would be considered advanced compared to this." 
" Thanks for making my childhood awesome","I used to watch this movie on repeats in my childhood. Don't know why but every scene was so good and deep i thought at that stage of my childhood. Ji rumba re ra jhanjhantaram was on my mouth üòÅ" 
" Stretched with stress","They can't even copy a script brilliantly. Ridiculously stretched poor dialogs, poor music and background score. Javed joffrey and other's over acting and poor execution by director."
