" What's wrong with those reviews?","Seriously, what's wrong with them??!! Hello CRITICS, We love movies which we enjoy! we, AM JANATA, don't care about what is out of the text book in a movie, we only care about what works! AND THIS FILM RIGHT HERE FREAKIN... WORKSS!!! when are you guys gonna start reviewing a film from our point of view and stop misleading us?! Shame on you! There are people doing hard work for years to make a God damn film and you guys don't even hesitate to stab it on it's back mercilessly!Okay, first of all, this is my first review in IMDb. I mostly come in here to see the reviews, watch the trailers and all. But after reading the reviews from our fellow PHYSICS PROFESSORS for this one, I just had to tell people the truth about this awfully underrated movie.THIS IS A MIND BLOWING ENTERTAINER!!!It's funny and packed with action. Trust me! If you liked DABANGG,you'll love this one. This movie has every freaking element to make you fall in love with it. Honestly,even the lead actress had a strong reason to be in the movie,....unlike most of the recent bollywood outcomes where you wonder "what does she have to do with the film?"!Shahid is charming, and a real combination of ROMEO and RAJKUMAR. He is not my favorite but he was really funny. And the fights may be "full of errors" to the reviewers with PHD in Experimental Physics. But I just looved the extremeness of the punches and kicks as well as the extremeness of his LOVE. And Sonakshi!! Boy o boy, SHE IS JUST SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL!!! Her dialogue delivery is so strong, that in some parts you'll be forced to realize that she is the future BEST FEMALE ACTOR. her "PYAAR PYAAR YA MAAR MAAR" look is just..... (out of words). Sonu sood is strong,ripped. his acting is good.Underutilized, but still looked damn EVIL in parts.You guys already know how amazing the songs are.I love all of them. So don't trust the reviews where "THE SONGS ARE ALL RIGHT" line exists.So, bottom line is, NEVER rely on the reviews.Go and see for yourself.This MASALA movie is worth watching twice. IT ACTUALLY DESERVES A 8/10 as there are flaws. few minutes after the interval IS a tiiiny bit boring.The climax scene is BIOLOGICALLY impossible. But I gave it full on 10 because it got so much unfair beating from the critics, it deserves more love from us now.HATERS WILL HATE. GO WATCH IT. YOU"LL LOVE IT!!........................from one of those mango people who made RAJKUMAR reach the TOP 10 WEEKENDS of 2013." 
" Good to watch!","RRajkumar is an intense, funny and action packed romantic bollywood masala movie. The theatrical experience was good, this motion picture will hold you until the climax. Neither it meets perfection nor it will disappoint you. A must watch for anyone looking for entertainment. For those who look for a message or moral at the end of the story.. I am sorry to say, you can remove it from your WatchList. Not a great movie for film critics either. Music/Dance and screenplay was interesting, got to see something new finally. Action sequences are deeply inspired from south Indian cinema. Shahid has done justice to his role and as expected Sonu Sood did a pretty well job." 
" Full on Entertainment","BOLLYWOOD is a mystical land where all cinema magic happen every Friday nd its happen again this Friday.R... Rajkumar smashed at BO. This movie actually define word called Bollywood. there is Dance,Music,strong characters,action scene,romance,comedy....goes on..!! Its story based on Afin Mafia war with Rom-Com-action in Prabhudeva style.Shahid gave full justice to his role as Romeo Rajkumar,in movie Sahid is really Romeo by his style and Rajkumar as well.Sonakshi and Sonu Sood acts really very nice which make movie more charismatic. Rajkumar work for strong character of movie Sonu Sood.And melt his heart for a girl named Chanda. By fault Sonu Sood also fall in love with Chanda & Chanda is the niece of his enemy,so at last both enemy patch up for more power.And Sonu Sood want to marry his enemy's niece.But Chanda loves Rajkumar.after that movie is all about who will win this war of love.?Best parts : Superb acting,Characters,dance of Shahid,songs,comedy, Prabhudeva Chiky tricks,cinematography ,climaxBad parts : interval.Second part is better then Frist one.specially in this movie when music came your head and legs start Tunning with it & dance is also really good up to the mark. some action scenes frame on a screen very well , this are the points which can't leave you from your seat.thumbs up for Prabhudeva direction,which takes this movie to another level.Last words : R... Rajkumar is perfect film which can make your weekend more energetic & beautiful.this movie is cup of tea for those who like real face of Bollywood i mean Masala movie just for fun and 2-3 hours.You know your Cup of tea and flavor. but this movie cover all your flavor! enjoy...!" 
" A full on entertainer movie","This is my first review, so excuse me for any mistakes. This movie starring Shahid Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha, has become one of my favorite in watch list. After Vivah, I didn't really like Shahid's character much in his latter films, but this movie changed my perception about him. He can become chocolate boy and dabangg boy when script requires. His expression, dialog delivery, tone, fighting scenes, attitude everything is damn good. Sonakshi fared very well in movie, great expression, some scenes are worth remembering and looked extremely beautiful. Good job Dabangg girl. Songs are good and worth watching once in a while. Even if story lacks unreal logic, its FULL ON entertainer. You can expect everything you want in a masala entertainment movie. Both Sonu and Shahid did justice to their roles. Fighting scenes are good, climax is unreal but great, chemistry is good too. Will give 8/10 for this underrated movie. If critics underrate it, it doesn't mean you won't like it. After all, everyone's got different taste." 
" Masaledaar film with lots of action-packed scenes!!!","When I watched the trailer of this film for the first time, I just knew that this film will create a lot of buzz and it actually did through its songs and hoopla around it!! When the film released, the reviews were not expected and quite shocked me!! But I made up my mind to watch the film no matter whatever happens!! And when I saw the film, I completely disagree with those giving negative reviews. I agree that we are used to watching masala-type films and even get bored sometimes but this film doesn't disappoints even for a moment! It exceeded my expectations! The first half is quite good with wonderful songs and actions! But the second half takes the film to another level through its twists and turns!! Overall, R.. Rajkumar is an entertaining film especially for those who love Shahid Kapoor!! It has all the ingredients: Actions, Comedy, Drama, Romance!! The performances by the cast are well-executed! It lives up to its hype!! Solid dialogues by Shahid Kapoor especially: PYAAR PYAAR PYAAR YA MAAR MAAR MAAR delivers a powerful crunch!!!"

" A poor film made on almost nothing is certainly a 'Gandi Baat' by its director Prabhudeva & his team.","A decent crowd of all youngsters coming to the theater in its first show was quite a pleasant scene unexpectedly and further a few cheers on its opening titles with the catchy music forced me to accept that may be I was wrong in underestimating another typical masala film before its wide release.But within an hour the whole scenario changed into something entirely different. The cheers went silent, mobiles could be seen flashing and the energy suddenly vanished into the thin year as the film turned out to be a complete dud with absolutely nothing to offer even to the die- hard fans of its famous cast and director (except the music). In few words, the experience was just like watching one of those routine South dubbed films regularly coming on the channels in a repeat mode when they have nothing else to play in their timeline. With neither anything new in the story department nor something novel in its execution, performances or direction, R RAJKUMAR simply seemed to me as a loud, over-confident and careless work of a director who has probably formed a fixed outlook towards film-making and has also assumed that the viewers are just a bunch of fools who can convert any crap into a hit if presented with the right packaging, over the top action, fast edits and catchy music.In fact to explain it differently, I would like to call R.RAJKUMAR a very COURAGEOUS film for the following strong reasons related to its entire team.A. It is a courageous venture since it has been made with such a lame but confident mindset as if it is to be shown to all dumb men and women sitting in the theater who have not grown their minds and thinking patterns since decades (or since the 80s). B. It is certainly a brave attempt by the director, who is fast moving on the path of losing his status of a LEGENDARY dancer & choreographer, with all repetitive dance direction and a pinch of vulgarity too in his 'Tapori' kind of steps (more noticed in the last 5-6 years of his career). Moreover, with almost nothing in the name of solid content in his recent films it seems that we are now having quite 'less read' directors around who really are unable or not capable of finding a good subject for their next ventures and just keep making the same kind of movies regularly taking their viewers for granted.C. The film is a bold move by its leading male star visibly, who despite of giving continuous flops, still displays no intelligence to choose his next projects and also carries a lot of attitude and arrogance in his on screen portrayal of drama, action and comedy altogether.D. It is a courageous step on part of its female lead too, who has now done exactly similar roles in so many films that probably she herself would not be able to recall any particular film if few selective shots are shown to her in a random order taken from her various films. Further, her expressions and mannerisms have such acute similarities that you often get a Deja-Vu kind of feel watching her repeatedly doing the same things again and again in her latest movie.E. The project is surely a confident 'at your face' kind of attempt since it feels no shame in using lyrics such as "Achhi Baatein Karli Bahot, Ab Karunga Tere Saath, Gandi Baat" and "Kaddu Phatega To Sab Mein Batega" as its item numbers. No doubt there are some good tracks too like "Saari Ke Faal Sa" but here I wish to add that it seems to be quite weird that when a song has already been composed and arranged so well, then what's the need of getting it written in such a vulgar and silly manner, following a completely sick vision to gain some extra attention.F. The film is also a courageous one, since the makers here show no respect, sympathy or admiration in using the veteran actor Asrani in a same routine act, shouting, laughing and babbling even at this age, wherein he even gets slapped more than once by Ashish Vidyarthi in an utterly useless or silly sequence.Hence as mentioned in the above points, R.RAJKUMAR is surely a brave film made by a courageous team, who thinks as if they have mastered the art of fooling the audience and can make anything in the name of cinema served with few catchy songs. The film has its few moments lead by loud music but you must have the same amount of courage to sit through it till the end and would only be able to tolerate this if you a regular viewer of numerous low grade South dubbed films shown on the cable channels as their filler programs." 
" R..Rajkumar promises to deliver but is letdown by wafer-thin 2nd half. Watch it for Shahid.","There is a overdose of masala films in 2013 - Police giri, Chennai Express , Boss, Bullet Raja , Singh Saab The Great and now R..Rajkumar. Good news is that R..Rajkumar is better than above movie ... bad news is that it is yet another typical action-melodrama with nothing new to offer. R..Rajkumar (played by Shahid Kapoor) is a fearless and daring thug who lands up in the lawless village and joins a drug-dealer's gang, Shivraj( played by Sonu Sood). Enters Chanda and our hero is head-over- heels in love with her. Things becomes ugly when Shivraj also starts liking and war is declared between the two to marry Chanda. After giving of string of masala films like Wanted , Rowdy Rathore and Ramaiya Vastavaiya , Prabhudeva is back with yet another popcorn entertainment with strong first half but diluted second half. The film begins with a bang by incorporating scenes like Shahid Kapoor saving Sonu Sood's life , the dance number in the song "Gandi Baat", the chemistry and comic humor between Shahid and Sonakshi. However, the film goes down the rabbit hole and is completely lost in the dark in the later part. Screenplay is weak. Cinematography is amazing. Art direction is good. Background score is better. Songs like "Gandi Baat and Saree ke fall se" are catchy. Shahid steals the thunder from the show. He is superb in acting , dancing and even doing action scenes. This film should prove his mettle. Sonakshi Sinha repeats herself. Sonu Sood is good.Overall, R..Rajkumar promises to deliver but is letdown by wafer-thin 2nd half. Watch it for Shahid. Average 2.5/5"

" Hit!","Never believe what paid critics have to say about any movie. R... Rajkumar was Shahid Kapoor's first full on Action movie and he did a phenomenal job! The colors and vibes of each song pulled you into a world of true love. SK pulled off every action scene flawlessly, you wouldn't even know that this was his first time doing any of these moves. R... Rajkumar perhaps was and is the 1st movie to show off how great of a dancer SK really is. Yes we all know SK can dance but when Prabhu Deva directs a movie and makes you dance you know your inter-talent will show through. And that's what happened with Shahid, every dance move was perfect to the T! There was still that lovable boy in Shahid character Romeo along with his comedy but that's what made his new avatar work and it worked for the best. Sonakshi Sinha role was great, aside from Lootera in this role we were able go she her in a different light. Finding for her love and never giving up. She shows she can act and not to judge her on her past roles. R... Rajkumar is a hit!" 
" Seriously disgusting!","R...Rajkumar is definitely one of the worst films of 2013. Everything about this film is wrong. The story is unappealing and the comedy is grossly overdone. You have a thug who constantly stalks the heroine and then challenges the villain that he'll be the one to remove the girl's sari and then take her to a honeymoon. Disgusting! I wonder if Prabhudeva was drunk when he made this film. Furthermore, the hero (or whatever) here acts more like a hoodlum. I know that he's made to play a hooligan but he totally lacks the virtue to win the girl. R...Rajkumar sticks out as crass, vulgar and sick. The song "Gaandi Baat" aptly describes the sick mentality of the hero. Shahid Kapur is an average actor and he is totally wasted in a cheap film like this. Sonakshi Sinha should START getting out of her 'desi girl' avatar. She is very bad in this movie and is getting type-casted in the 'village belle' type roles. Overall, nothing works for R...Rajkumar. It seems Prabhudeva was out of his mind when he was making this film. I would've loved to see his magic recreated after Rowdy Rathod. But I was seriously disappointed.I give it 3/10." 
" Stay away","Right from the first scene where a flying Shahid Kapoor's wrist deflects a bullet, you know he is venturing into sacred territory- Rajni Saar territory. What follows is partly entertaining, and partly unbearable, in short as inconsistent as Air India flights, but is definitely not as bad as the media has made it out to be. If anything, R..Rajkumar is just as banal as Boss, Himmatwala, Besharam, Grand Masti, Race 2 and other such stalwarts released this year.Pyar pyar pyar, ya maar maar maar- is the motto of Romeo Rajkumar (Shahid Kapoor) , who lands up one fine day in Dhartipur, which is ruled by two warring bad guys- Gurjar (Sonu Sood) and Parmar (Ashish Vidyarthi). He initially sides with Gurjar, but both of them fall in love with Parmar's niece, sparking off a clownish game of oneupmanship between the two, leading to a brutal and bloody end. Even though it is not a remake, the rest of the movie is standard Southern masala action fare- gravity defying stunts, multiple slow motion cuts, lungi clad goons, a few catchy songs, romance and melodrama. The first half passes away rather breezily, but the film falters badly post interval- everything in it never seems to end- the fights, the songs, the repetitive dialogs.Shahid Kapoor is at his sincerest. He dances well, fights even better, and puts on his best lovestruck Romeo act, but such a larger than life character is beyond his wiry shoulders. Sonakshi Sinha is again the familiar annoying village belle- the one role she has perfected. She is two heroines for the price of one, alternates between the scowl and the shy- and takes a beating like a man. Sonu Sood is at his hammiest worst, and Ashish Vidyarthi is reduced to rather sad comedy.It is hard to find positives in R..Rajkumar. Initially the R was supposed to stand for Rambo, but later changed to Romeo. It somehow felt that director Prabhu Dheva lost sense of the characters midway- whether to make an all out action film, or to make a romantic one. To go full on emotion, or get some comedy on. The end product has a bit of all, but the soul of none. At the end the only thing worth talking of is the style with which Rajkumar beats the living daylights of however stands in his way. Is that worth the price of admission? A definite no- 5/10" 
" Below The Mark!","Prabhudheva's 'R... Rajkumar' is Below The Mark! The film, despite boasting superb action, fantastic music & an impressive leading-man, fails to engage, as the Script is predictable & not-so-entertaining, at most parts.'R... Rajkumar' Synopsis: A thug fights for his lady-love, in the middle of a warfare between two warring gangsters.'R...Rajkumar' has an ordinary first-hour, but a disappointing second. The action-sequences are superb, but the Script is very predictable. One can foresee the entire film & that acts as a minus point. Also, the excessive violence in the goings-on is off-putting.Prabhudheva's Direction is loud. Cinematography is fair. Editing is hurried up. The Music is fantastic. Each song is catchy & memorable.Performance-Wise: Shahid is impressive, yet again. He enacts Rajkumar with admirable conviction. Even when the Script slips, he doesn't. He's an under-rated actor, who needs to do better films! Sonakshi Sinha does a fine job. Sonu Sood is wasted. Asrani is over-the-top. Ditto for Ashish Vidyarthi. Mukul Dev is very sincere. Late Actor Srihari does well.On the whole, 'R... Rajkumar' is not up-to the mark." 
" worsest work of Prabhudeva until now in Bollywood","After such a bunch of "MASALA"-movies this year Prabhudevas last work R...Rajkumar is his worsest work until now in Bollywood. The movie doesn't have a real storyline and just follow the same path like in almost every masala movie. That's normally OK for a Prabhudeva movie, but he normally can also attract the audience with his charm and a bit different kind of storytelling, but this time the scenes, songs and fights are just cut and joined to each other in which you loose the fun of such a movie. Beside this is Shahid Kapoor not suiting such a MASALA movie like it was before with Shah Rukh and Saif. So this work of Shahid is also not brilliant and he is getting lost with his flops which appear to be normal to him nowadays. In case of Sonakshi Sinha, I can't say anything else beside this that she almost playing the same stuff like she has played before in Dabangg. Same to the villain.In the whole I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch the movie... It would be better if you watch a earlier movie of Prabhudeva when you are in the mood of a MASALA movie."
