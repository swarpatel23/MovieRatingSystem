" World class theater","Seldom are movies made from a play... & this one goes the right way! The last theater i can remember off hand was AANKHEN... A Bachan & Paresh Rawal.. The movie wasn't quite catchy, but one could imagine the kind of theatrical performances it must have delivered..Today, i saw an actual performance, only difference being, I saw it on the screen.. The way the movie was done, one felt the characters were alive on a stage in front of me!!!The plot of the movie is very good. But the performances are mind blowing! One couldn't have set a better cast, & while the ladies need to do much better, the quartet of Boman, Paresh, Naseer & Om Puri swept me off my feet!While Paresh Raval dominates the movie completely, it is Boman's sharp performance that draws the curtain! I couldn't have spent my Friday night better.It is a movie worth treasuring... Please have a look!" 
" Paresh is truly Maharathi","It was an awesome flick and all the big guns shouted in Unison. Paresh and Boman are outstanding. Paresh Rawal act fabulously in the movie. The movie is eye catching from very of its beginning and also audience start guessing about the characters from starting scenes. The movie catches the speed in 30-40 mins when Tag line of movie "How do you murder a man who has already committed suicide?", actually start reflecting in the story. Paresh's acting of fooling others and expressions of innocence at the same time, truly differentiates him from other actors. His drama to misguide the police officer and lawyer was really comic part of movie and pours humor. Even sometimes it makes you roll into laughter. Hats off to Paresh. Uttam Gada is really admirable for writing such a nice script. Good direction by Shivam Nair, a bit loose in the second half but covered in the end. Neha Dhupiya's acting was only negative even though she is very less to do. Overall worth watching the "Maharathi"." 
" good enough","It left me satisfied, honestly speaking. Nothing very great, except that maybe it features Paresh Rawal, Boman Irani and Naseeruddin Shah in a supportive role...It begins on a very boring note... very normal beginning and suddenly you feel like walking out and at that very moment the movie begins. Very thrilling story where a suicide has to be proved a murder in order to achieve a large sum of money.Light humor in places keeps the viewer not in suspense (trust me there's enough of that!), but keeps the person in a very interested mood. Naseeruddin Shah has given a good performance, and so has Boman Irani, and even Neha Dhupia was fine-ish, but the best performance no doubt was Paresh Rawal's! Very humorous, and very enriching and refreshing.Of course there were errors, and the cinematography could have been a 1000x better, because the camera is shaky at parts, and some gross errors (like blinking when you're dead!), but they can be ignored seeing the final result.All-in-all, with a very humorous and shocking climax and NO SONGS AND NO ROMANCE, this film has left me highly satisfied.Recommended to all. 7/10." 
" a thriller having the finest actors bollywood's delivered.","a brilliant movie ... taking a risk of making a thriller which the Indian masses can understand is a big one.. though the multiplex audience (like me) loved the movie .. there are no romantic subplots or any item songs .. but just sheer acting and brilliant screenplay. a shot when the camera zooms out of a keyhole is one of the most brilliant scenes i have seen in Hindi cinema ... the protagonist looks like a young 30'sh year old fella, being done by paresh rawal (suresh in the movie), by great method acting. the movie urges the audience to think, like a thriller and the plot is an unpredictable one, for an Hindi movie, where almost everything is so predictable from the start .. the bad points are that tara sharma and neha dhupia have their limitations to act, is visible.. apart from them, and a few minor glitches, the movie is a must watch for someone seeking alternate bollywood cinematic experience..." 
" Loses steam as it chugs along....","For starters the title is not apt. it gives an impression of a mythological drama (Ramayana/ Mahabharata). Well, it is clearly inspired by the success of Johnny Gaddar a la James Hadley Chase. Perhaps as a novel, it does ensure edge-of-seat excitement with twists and turns at every turn of page but sadly it failed to translate on screen. Again Johnny Gaddar should be a good reference point.Performances::§ Naseer:: Lesser mortals like us are in no position to comment on his work. § Paresh Rawal:: He was good if not excellent. The smart one-liners seemed stuffed into is mouth. His act of putting on the loyalty mask, seemed OTT. His frequent dispute with Neha Dhupia and Boman Irani were kind of show-stoppers to the narration.§ Om Puri - Very short role and hence didn't get an opportunity to display histrionics.§ Boman Irani - Very confident performance. § Neha Dhupia - Passable.§ Tara Sharma - The "Little Red Riding Hood" act does raise the suspicion bar. Plus her choice of donning the same role every time is getting monotonously boring.One gets a feel of watching a two-part episode from the Karamchand series, if you know what I mean. Shivam Nair won critical accolades for his work Ahista-Ahista, however seems this time putting shoulders to the wheel wasn't quite sufficient." 
" An unqualified Thriller with unanswered questions !!!","Shivam Nair's film Maharathi is a suspense thriller that keeps many questions unanswered till the end. The film comes with some of the finest performance of lead actors but that doesn't make up for the flaws in the script. The film is about how a common man gets the property money of his employer and the legal aspect of making a will is not convincingly clarified..Adapted from a very popular Gujarati play by the same name, Maharathi makes for an interesting watch solely for the performance of almost all its lead actors. But what keeps on striking the viewer constantly are the limitations of a play being adapted to the big screen. Firstly, for a thriller, the plot appears far too stretched, especially in the first half. Then once the first major twist in the plot takes place, what follows is at times, a matter of convenience. OK even if you are willing to forgive some cinematic liberties, what really comes out is not only predictable but also raises many questions..If you want a taste of a desi version of Sleuth, Peter Shaffer's spellbinding play-turned-film, go watch Maharathi. The story may be different, the edge of danger is almost similar." 
" Some good performances - the second half is exciting","The VCD story, when read, may appear to be telling about several conmen trying to outwit each other. However, it is the catchline (tagline) that takes the cake and paves the way for the story to unfold.The first half was a bit stretched although it was good for character development of some of the lead characters. Paresh goes a little over the top several times in this movie, perhaps as a result of bringing a theatre piece to the screen. Boman, Paresh, Om and Naseer are great in the other scenes, especially in the second half when the pace catches up.I did find a couple of plot points predictable but it still manages to get the attention of the viewers due to clever atmosphere-building.This is not a great film or a masterpiece but I still give it 9 for its plot and entertainment value." 
" An unqualified Thriller with too many unanswered questions.","Based on a successful play by Paresh Rawal, "Maharathi" is said to be a thriller but I found it lacking the requisites of a tight thriller or a good murder mystery. The very start of the mystery sequence or murder scene pops up some questions which are enough to make you lose interest in the plot. The main blunder why I am calling it "An Unqualified Thriller" is made by the writer who penned it and the director who never questioned it.If the writer and director of a murder mystery think that putting a Dead Body in a deep freezer for many days will keep the time and day of the murder A Secret, then it simply means that they still have to get their facts right. It's the most childish forensic liberty taken ever in a crime movie.To make it simple, it's based on a plot where Naseer shoots himself in front of Paresh Rawal and Neha Dhupia and leaves them a challenge to prove his suicide as a murder if they can. Now in the next scene you see that Paresh & Neha both decide to put the dead Naseer in a deep freezer and plan to take him out after some days. And this is all done saying that putting the body in the freezer will never tell the day and time of the murder to anyone. And the whole movie moves around that freezer in which the body lies.The moment this came on screen I lost all my interest of seeing the talented star-cast together in a mystery movie. The movie has been shot competently but the writing leaves wide cracks open in the mystery. Paresh Rawal as always carries the movie on his shoulders and tries hard to make it convincing. Though the performances of Naseer, Neha and Boman were enjoyable and the director Shivam Nair also manages to shoot some good sequences. But the viewer cannot be served performances alone. The makers need to think that audiences have some to see a crime drama with twists and turns opening new angles to think.If a Murder Mystery raises too many questions and there are no answers to those queries in the narration then it doesn't qualify to be a good thriller. "Maharathi" is the best example to that. For example, Why Nasser kills himself and why not he kills his wife Neha instead to get rid of all troubles? Why he leaves everything inherited to Paresh whom he has met just few days ago? Ironically, there is a life insurance of 25 crores done by Nasser and he is living his life miserably all in debts. If he can manage to pay the premium of this huge sum then why he cannot pay his debts off? Tara Sharma, an architecture student, is kept as a house keeper who never visits the room of his sick employer and just keeps on washing floors. She is shown to be dumb and a night walker too but surprisingly she is sharp enough to help Paresh by giving false statement to the police knowing that he will never get caught.What is Boman Irani (The Lawyer) contribution to the plot? What was his relationship with Neha? Boman seems to be doing silly things in the climax, not expected from a well established Criminal Lawyer? Om Puri (completely wasted) enters as a detective and he is so experienced but he doesn't doubt Paresh and never questions him about background or his entry in the house just few days back. And in the climax he just shoots Boman, just like that as if it was an encounter. Why he doesn't shoot on his hand as a responsible officer? Apart from these there are so many questions which I can go on with but there is no use of listing them as they would not get any answers. But I must say that if a die-hard fan of Alfred Hitchcock, Agatha Christie, Felu-Da and Byomkesh Bakshi (like myself) watches this movie then he will not like to say anything but would only love to get back to the masters of mystery cinema as soon as possible and see or read any one of their creations again.Interestingly the plot of putting the dead body in a box (deep freezer here) is quite similar to that in Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope". You can watch "Maharathi" only if you can ignore the faulty plot and would love to see the performances of the talented actors together." 
" Movie to enjoy","This movie has everything; lot of turns and twists in the plot to keep you in nail-biting and the best thing is your mood will be pleasant all the way even a tragic accident is filmed in such a way that you don't feel unpleasant. You go in the hall on Friday afternoon, enjoy 2h and 18m and come out with a mood full of joy. Now the question is why people did not notice this movie? I would say the name of the movie. Even when I saw the name I thought it is a stunt movie." 
" A Good Entertainer! ♦ 67%","Maharathi is a surprise package of 2008. The cast is well-set and play their characters with absolute finesse. Paresh Rawal & Naseerudin Shah are the vital players. Neha Dhupia, Tara Sharma & Om Puri do equally well. Special mention for Boman Irani.Starting off with a suspense-creating setup, the plot describes the prologue. After 40 minutes, the real side of the plot is revealed. And this is when it gets interesting. It's an edge of the seat thriller in the second half, if you can bypass the monotonous, slow-paced first half.Editing, make-up, costumes, studio setup are all very poor, giving a worn-out display of the whole movie. Cinematography & direction are fine. The writing is good, especially the dialogs towards the end. Other than having few plot holes, Maharathi is a good entertainer. Mildly interesting is what I would dub it!BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. A 6.7 out of 10 for the story, plot & performances.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity/Vulgarity/Sex: No | Nudity: Very Mild | Mouth-Kiss: No | Violence/Gore: Mediocre | Alcohol: Critical | Smoking/Drugs: No | Porn: No" 
" There's always a price tag.","Whilst searching around online to try and answer a question which had been asked on the IMDb Film Noir board,("Is there a movie based on the Hadley Chase novel There's Always a Price Tag?")I was very happy to find that there was a 2008 Bollywood adaptation of the novel,due to having searched for a good while to find a Bollywood Noir,which I hoped to use as an introduction to the genre for a friend,who is a pretty big fan of Bollywood films. The plot:Whilst driving back home,washed-up film producer Jaisingh Adenwalla suddenly crashes his car.Luckally for him,a man called Subhash Sharma is near by.Sharma,realising that the car could blow up at any moment,bravely pulls Adenwalla safely away from the wreckage.As Adenwalla begins to regain consciousness,he tells Subhash that he has been completely taken aback,by how much a total stranger was willing to risk his own life to save another's.To show his gratitude for Subash, (who has been attempting to become a film star for the last 10 years) Adenwalla pushes Sharma into excepting a job offer of being his private driver,whose wages he will pay for himself.Sadly,this does not go down too well with Adenwalla's "trophy wife" Mallika,who is constantly trying to get money out of him,to repay some of the debt from his box office disasters-ten years ago.Although his wife tries to get Subhash fried,by playing some very nasty games,Adenwalla stubbornly refuses to fire him,partly because he sees in Sharma someone who he would have pushed into the spotlight,during his heyday.Shortly after the argument over the hiring,Mallika becomes extremely angry,when she is told by Adenwalla that all her cheques will now permanently bounce,due to him having cancelled all the transfers of his cash going into her account.Hearing this,Mallika ends up throwing Jaisingh's breathalyser away,during a horrible asthma attack.Thankfully,Subhash is near by,and he is able to get hold of the breathalyser in time.Being distraught over the treatment from his wife,Adenwalla gathers Subhash,to secretly give him a letter,which he orders to be delivered to his lawyer the next day.Later on that same day,Jaisingh tells Mallika and Sharma to come and sit with him,so he can announce something to both of them.To Mallika's shock,Adenwalla tells her that he has changed his will,so that she would be unable to collect any of his money if he commits suicide.Jaisingh then tells Sharma that he asked him to be here,so that he would not be set up as a murderer.Suddenly,Adenwalla pulls out a gun,and kills himself!Whilst they both try to gather there thoughts,Subhash decides to open the letter that Adenwalla had left for his lawyer.To his amazement,Subash discovers that the will has been changed for him to be the main benefactor.As he gets to the end of the letter,Subash realises that Adenwalla had written the letter,so that Sharma would also not be able to get the money if he commits suicide. Quickly realising that if he and Mallika make it look for a few days that Adenwalla is still alive,they would be able to convince people that Adenwalla has actually been murdered,Subash stops Mallika from phoning the police,and tells her that if she wants to get hold of any of her husbands money,then she must follow his plan...View on the film:The first people who I feel should be really praised for giving the film a great Noir mood are the wonderful cast,with Naseeruddin Shah delivering a scene-stealing performance as the boozed-up movie producer,who whilst softening to Subhash,still has a very crusty,bitter side.For the role of his trophy wife,Neha Dhupia has Mallika be someone who attempts to dig her nails deep into her husbands bank account,hoping that nothing will cause her to lose her grip.Playing the main character who devises the cunning plan to cover Adenwalla's suicide,Paresh Rawal excellently shows the cunning,darker side of Subhash gradually creep in,with Subhash being shown to strongly believe that,if,he and Mallika are able to convince people that a murder has taken place,he will at last be able to get hold of all of the riches,that Subhash has been trying to grip on to,since attempting to break into the film industry. With the very good directing of the film,director Shivam Nair wisely leaves out any songs,until the end credits.Instead,he unexpectedly gives the film a David Fincher look,with some stunning shoots in the film,being ones that would not be out of place in Finchers under- appreciated 2002 thriller Panic Room.Nair also cleverly keeps Mallika in distance shoots,until the suicide of her husband,leads her to "crossing the floor" and grudgingly talking to Subhash.Sadly,the praise the can be given to the excellent cast and great directing can not be given to the screenplay by Uttam Gada.After having done well to build up to Adenwalla's suicide in the first half Gada. Sadly gets the film to full into a hole,which it is never able to completely escape from,with the death of a major character in the middle section of the film,giving a huge opportunity for the film to end on a Noirish,moody note.Shockingly,Gada decides to handle the death of the character as badly as possible,with no explanation being offered,and any possible hint of the other characters having a motive for the killing,being swiftly brushed under the carpet. Final view on the film:A very well directed,overlooked Bollywood Film Noir,with great performances from the excellent cast,let down by an unexpectedly tangled screenplay." 
" Good Evening Entertainer","I watched this movie last night and had not read any reviews at all. My brother watched this movie before me and told me that I will enjoy it. Initially I thought to be a bit slow and i was starting to lose any interest, but once the major twist in the film occurs I was drawn back into the movie until the credits. Its did give me a sense of it being inspired from an old Hollywood movie called 'Slueth' (I think thats how you spell it) staring Micheal Caine. Over all it was a good movie for all to enjoy.This movie shows you can make a good movie without having Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar in the lead roles.Paresh Rawal brings back memories of Johnny Walker (50's & 60's Comedian). There are some good performances from all the actors (male & female), Especially Om Puri and Boman Irani. IF you have not seen this movie, i shall recommend you do watch this. And the Plus point, In the 2 or so hours there are no songs, so the story is flowing, so no toilet or tea breaks :-)." 
" Brilliant","The movie is a fantastic thrillar. It has Brilliant acting, powerful screenplay and fantastic story line.The movie revolves around the death of Jai Singh Aetanwala who commits suicide but challenges his wife to prove it murder to claim a hefty insurance amount. The movie takes several twists and turns until climax." 
" Lovely movie !","Lovely movie , excellent performances , top notch screenplay , loved every bit of it , nail biting climax" 
" Mahatricky","Shivam Nair assembles a fine cast in 'Maharathi'. With actors like Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri in one movie, you would expect something great. I enjoyed the execution. It has that film noire feel to it. The interiors of Adenwalla's mansion is stunning. The cinematography is first rate. The editing is sharp. The element of mystery, suspense and drama is well maintained. The events unfold smoothly but surprisingly. Every time one would expect the story to follow a certain track, the viewer is thrown off with something unexpected. Paresh Rawal does a very good job carrying the film. Boman Irani isn't bad either. Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri also do nothing short of a fine job (unfortunately they don't share screen space). Neha Dhupia looks the part but struggles to convince. It was great to see Tara Sharma after a long time. While I liked the whole mystery part, I was disappointed by the ending. I would have preferred a darker finale. In the conclusion, Subhash is portrayed as a character of little fault but he is almost as guilty as Adenwalla's wife. It was his plan to start with, as a consequence of which someone actually died. Yet, he turns out to be the good guy because the one who died is of 'loose' morals in comparison. This is a major flaw that prevents me from calling 'Maharathi' excellent. I also find it less convincing that a millionaire would leave his entire estate to a stranger he knows so little about. However, I didn't mind it at all for a one time watch because it's well made and has some good performances." 
" A murder mystery without a murder","Apparently based on a gujarati play that featured Paresh Rawal himself, this is a very interesting movie with some good twists and turns.A very interesting plot that seems original and well thought out. The movie starts off average, builds very well. Unlike most movies that seem to miss the bus at the end, this one does well at the end.The first half belongs to Naseeruddin Shah, the old eccentric one time successful film producer, who is now in debt and has a drinking problem. He is helped by Paresh Rawal in a car accident and subsequently, gives Rawal the job of a driver.His wife, Neha Dhupia is a gold-digger who constantly fights and wants him dead to then lay her hands on the hefty insurance policy.The story picks up when Naseer shoots himself and challenges her to prove that it was not suicide. If a suicide is proved, she doesn't receive any insurance. While the movie says that it will be because he has written that clause in the benefactor agreement, I believe most insurance companies offer no compensation in the case of a proved suicide.This is where Paresh Rawal enters the center stage and its brilliant to watch him transition from a demure master-worshiping driver to a scheming thug.Boman Irani, Neha Dhupia and Tara Sharma perform their parts well and are thoughtfully cast. While I wonder what Dhupia and Sharma were doing in the movie at first, I believe there has been some good thought put into their casting.The background score was non existent {didnt realize that there was one} and could have complemented the actors well. The director thankfully resists the temptation of item numbers.An interesting twist in the ending and a screenplay that makes a lot of sense.All in all, a great watch."
