" one of the boring movies","One of the worst movies of Govinda. I still believe Govinda can find better movies as he has mass audience. But its foolish to make movies like this when you know whats going to happen. Its worse than C grade movies.Jagmohan Mundhra has been a good director in the past. We don't expect such movies from him with old rotten jokes in this movie. Sanjay Mishra was good though in his little role.I think its time Govinda should act in movies with other main actors like Sunny Deol is doing. Now he look foolish sexually playing with girls younger than his daughter's age and now even his daughter is also coming in movies soon. Wish i could vote 0.Vinay" 
" NAUGHTY @40 and its inspirations","Before making the recent serious movies based on few realistic subjects, director Jagmohan Mundhra was more associated with many controversial projects made around the subject of sex. And probably NAUGHTY @ 40 was also planned on those similar lines as a Sex-Comedy with Govinda playing a 40 years old virgin looking for help from his friends.The film has a very stale look may be due to its long in the making time span. Govinda tries his best to give you the same old good time in the theater, but in the process fails miserably. The film remains a badly made comedy which neither makes you laugh nor keeps you hooked on to the screen effectively. Moreover, NAUGHTY @ 40 is clearly inspired from two major sources. One as the name suggests is obviously the English Sex Comedy "THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN" released in 2005. The first half of the film is strictly written around this hilarious plot not exploited in an entertaining way at all.But the second half of the movie is heavily inspired from one of our own Bollywood's Sex-Comedy's called "ANUBHAV" released in 1986 which had Shekhar Suman, Padmini Kolhapure and Richa Sharma in the lead. In fact this film became hugely famous in the year of its release due to its highly controversial bold scenes which were the first of its kind in Indian Cinema at that particular point of time. The plot of marrying a girl having a childish mind knowing nothing about the rituals and adjustments post marriage straight away reminds you of that enjoyable comedy of the mid eighties and its famous scenes." 
" The Terrific Govinda!","'Naughty @ 40' proves one fact right again: Govinda is a Terrific Actor. The comedic legend of Hindi Cinema is in super form once again! 'Naughty @ 40' Synopsis: A 40 year old male virgin with sleep-walking problems finds true love after getting married to a naive child-like woman.'Naughty @ 40' has some funny moments, which work mainly because of Govinda's blessed comic timing. The film does entertain, but the second-hour is lengthy & the culmination is far from satisfying. Sure, no one expects 'Naughty @ 40' to be a masterpiece, but one does except to be entertained. The Screenplay is humorous, but only in bits and pieces. Late Jagmohan Mundhra's Direction is perfect. Cinematography is eye-filling. Performance-Wise: Besides Govinda, who is simply superb, Yuvika does pretty well as the leading lady. In the supporting cast, Anupam Kher, Sanjay Mishra, Harish & Shakti Kapoor are good. On the whole, If you're a die-hard Govinda Fan, don't miss this one!" 
" Even the people aged at 40s will hate this!","Naughty@40 is a bad movie.The movie was so awful that I left the theater before the intermission too.The movie has a good subject but Jag Mundhra must take care how to handle the subject perfectly.Mundhra handled the subject amazingly horrible.The locales of London too have not been captured well.Its so sad Govinda doing such type of roles.The story is good The screenplay is horrible.The music is pretty awful.The dialogs are dreadful.Performances-Govinda,Anupam Kher,Shakti Kapoor and Yuvika Chaudhary stink.If the lead actors itself stink,then what do we say about the supporting actors.On the whole Naughty@40 stinks!"
