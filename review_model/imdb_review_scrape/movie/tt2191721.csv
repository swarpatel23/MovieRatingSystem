" A Decent Rom-Com!","Ashwini Chaudhary's 'Jodi Breakers' is A Decent Rom-Com, that's simple & uncomplicated. Even the performances as well as the music, work!'Jodi Breakers' Synopsis: Sid and Sonali help people getting divorces, who are not happy in their married life. While in the case of Mark and Maggie Pereira, it is then Sonali comes to know about Sid's intentions which affect their own relationship.'Jodi Breakers' is harmless & sweet. Sure, The Screenplay does slip in the second-hour, but overall, a winning first-hour coupled with light moments take this rather under-rated Rom-Com to the safe side. Ashwini Chaudhary's Screenplay is mostly well-done, while his Direction is ordinary. Cinematography captures the stunning locales of Greece, most effectively. Editing is fair. Music by Salim-Sulaiman is peppy & lively.Performance-Wise: R. Madhavan & Bipasha Basu excel in lead-roles. Madhavan continues to act brilliantly, while Bipasha looks fabulous & plays her part with dignity. Also, the on-screen between the two, is exciting. Milind Soman & Dipannita Sharma are okay. Mrinalini Sharma is sincere. Omi Vaidya is funny. Helen is all grace.On the whole, 'Jodi Breakers' is a smooth watch." 
" Why we keep on repeating ourselves in the name of New Concepts?","Beginning with the inspirational connections, JODI BREAKER takes the idea for its lead couple's strange profession and its title from a 2010 French film HEARTBREAKER, but it is not a straight copy as was being said before its release. The plot no doubt had the potential of making a fine romantic comedy but it unfortunately doesn't work at all due to the same old repetitive stuff which we had earlier whole heartedly appreciated in BAND BAAJA BAARAT, where we had Wedding Planners instead of Marriage Breakers. Interestingly, this concept of a team of JODI BREAKERS or Divorce Specialist might be fresh for many, but as I recall, Govinda played a similar kind of specialist in his 2009 comedy LIFE PARTNER too which also couldn't sustain at the box office.The unimpressive promos of the film already had me in doubt as they clearly revealed the whole movie in a single line dialogue. In one of the key promos, Helen yells at both Madhavan and Bipasha saying "You two were only the cause of their break-up and now you two only would bring them together again." Now this one line only clearly gives away the whole plot of the film in just a few seconds and I really couldn't understand how the director Ashwini Chaudhary could approve such kind of revealing promo for his film made quite unintelligently. The promo, heavily publicized at all the leading channels simply ruins the whole surprise element of the film which could have been easily avoided.Further it has a very boring and uneven script which neither allows it to become an enjoyable sex comedy nor a good romantic film in its both unimpressive halves. In fact the first half of the film is so distasteful that one loses all the hope of getting anything interesting in its later reels. The disappointment continues post intermission too, as it once again offers those same old rotten love sequences lacking any freshness. The writers also throw in few weird comedy sequences here and there to fill in the spaces. But the unpleasant humor in them fails to do the trick wherein we are shown a Baba Kamdev (referring towards Baba Ramdev), a sexually psycho wife and few doctors fighting in an operation theater right in middle of an operation, with the patient sinking in front of them. In the acting department, its again a big letdown since no-one is able to deliver something exceptional mainly due to its lousy script. Madhavan looks tired in the whole film with an untidy kind of get-up. Bipasha, apart from her item song, doesn't look ravishing as she did in her previous films. Moreover the chemistry between the two is also missing particularly in their drunken kiss scene lacking the required sensuality. Rest of cast is strictly OK with Omi Vaidya once again trying to raise a few laughs with his new sexual speech.In all JODI BREAKERS has got nothing novel or fresh, you might be expecting from its unusual title. Still, ending on a positive note, it offers only a few enjoyable moments which mostly come in its good songs like "Kunwara", "Bipasha" and "Darmiyan". Plus it also gives you a visually delightful foreign tour at the cost of your 200 bucks ticket. So you can easily make your decision if you are interested in these." 
" One time watchable Black Humour","First half comedy- Second half Feelings... Stereo type Bollywood movie.Cast: R.Madhavan and Bipasha Basu are good as a pair(Jodi Breakers) but still chemistry is not enough.Madhavan's eyes are expressive. Dunno why they gave him that big glasses which hides them. Omi Vaidhya steals the comedy part after 3 idiots.Bips hot as usual.Cinematography: It's good especially when it captures the beauty of Greece. But nothing different in this.Art(costumes,sets): Art is very fine throughout the movie except for Madhavan's Big glasses.Direction: Director had used the actors well though could have used more of the lead actors, Madhavan and Bipasha Basu.Music: BGM is good. "Kunwara" is peppy. "Dharmiyan" is a classical treat! Others are average.Bottomline: Not a family film. So better watch alone." 
" Best Story","This Movie is an excellent movie from starting to end you will be thinking what will be the plan. Jodie Breaker is one of a kind movie that has a unique story. Do not fall for the low ratings, people don't have time these days to sign up and rate movies that's why you rarely see ratings and the only losers who have time to talk crap about movies and judge them are the ones usually seen complaining about stuff. At fist look to the poster i thought it was Anil Kapoor again with Bipasha, so i was like Not again,but when i saw the movie it is very unique and never seen such good movie with a new story like this.Must watch. If you are or ever were in a relationship then you should definitely watch it. Trust me You will like it. I Promise you."
