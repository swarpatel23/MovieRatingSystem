" Achieves what it tries to. Nothing more!!!","I watched the film because some of my friends had already booked tickets for me without my permission. Otherwise, i wouldn't have.Anyone who has seen Singham has to necessarily see this one. I actually liked the first Singham film. The purpose of this film seems to be to enhance the reputation of the titular character. It does so quite successfully but adds nothing more. You are there in the multiplex, you know whats going to happen, yet you still watch it because the first film was good (I call it the First Film syndrome).Now, coming to the actual review. I think the film lacked substance, originality as well as plot. The plot was relatively simple. Most of the film is full of slow-mo shots of Ajay Devgn walking from a car towards some one or delivering a highly intense dramatized dialog and very loud music playing in the background as the camera pans followed by intense mindless actions (but isn't it the point of Singham films).There was one point on which the film could have elaborated more which was the plight of the family of the deceased police officer. But it was relatively short and ended up without much consequence. Some humorous one-liners were tried during the film but they were too few and too far between. The film tries to portray the unity among Mumbai police but its very clichéd and highly improbable. The end result is that you are disconnected from the film. You can surf the net and read an entire chapter of the Mahabharata while Singham has walked from his car (or whatever it is) to the villain. But you are never bored. The film achieves what it wants. You have to decided whether you want the same thing. If yes and if mindless action films are your taste and you want only goodie-good things happening in your film whose start and end can be predicted with a 98% accuracy by a 3 year old, then this film is just for you. Enjoy." 
" typical rohit shetty entertainment movie... IGNORABLE","If you are expecting something new in this second part of Singham, then you will be totally disappointed like me.There's nothing great about story and script, its average. Kareena Kapoor is okay to watch. Amol Gupte is good but not excellent.And Daya is doing only fighting.Dialogues are not good as they were in the first part. You can predict almost the movie, except the end, which is again tried to be similar as of first part of the movie.If you like seeing some bullshit fight scenes, almost duplicate macho dialogues as were in first part, if you like to see Kareena Kapoor's similar role as of golmaal 3, if you like to listen below mediocre music, want to see again Ajay Devgan killing bad people like one man army... then of course, this movie is totally for you!!" 
" Very poor film","This film contains nothing new,same old hit formula story which is copied from previous numerous films,if only for something new is more gun shot scene,more car being blown up which you will see in rohit 'shitty' films.If you are not bored by same old story and want some action,romance etc you can waste your time and money watching this film.I wasted my 300 rs watching this film which even don't deserve to be even 30 rs film due to my friend who forced me to watch this film on weekend.I think bollywood stories will not change even after 100 years from now because all bollywood looks for 200+ crore profit film with mindless people like us watching it and helping bollywood to make more money to watch more worst films like this.Why can't Indian story writers show some creativity?is the question still remains to be answered." 
" More of the same","Crash. Boom. Bang. Dialogues. Angry but well intentioned cops, evil and slimy politicians. Earth shattering music. Irrelevant dance numbers. Slow motion walks. Physics defying stunts. Never ending guns. Speeding cars. Even flying cars. More crash boom bang. Recognize the flow? That is any modern mas-ala Hindi movie, specifically of the Rohit Shetty variety. Other than the settings and the heroine, there is virtually nothing different in Singham Returns over Singham.Ajay Devgn is back as super-cop Bajirao Singham, and he is going to clean up Mumbai of all evil by any means possible, whether that means going undercover, or showing up in underclothes, or by indulging in wanton lawlessness himself. Guruji (Anupam Kher) is a virtuous politician, his idealistic agenda takes the best of all current political parties- BJP's development agenda, AAP's corruption, and Congress's woman empowerment, and drives involvement of today's youth in politics. Opposing him is a political-religious nexus, fronted by Amol Gupte's Asaram Bapu styled sleazy god-man, Babaji and Zakir Hussain's Prakashrao. When one of Singham's compatriots is found dead with a large stash of cash, the standard hero versus villain storyline takes over. He also has to play lover-boy to Kareena Kapoor's near mental character Avni, deliver whistle inducing dialogs, position himself as the solution to all the problems that beset India, lead a ludicrous police uprising which involves the 47,000 strong Mumbai police force going shirtless, and deliver his own brand of justice, which includes shooting folks in their bums. Twice.Ajay and Rohit are a hit combination, whether the nonsensical Golmaal or the all too serious Singham series. This is an out and out Ajay Devgn show, and he is in roaring form, after the monstrosity that was Himmatwala. It helps that the script gives him a tailor made role to shine in all his brooding glory, and topics that the audience will relate to easily- black money and divisive politics. Ajay is permanently in Hulk mode, however, it is the vigilante like message that is worrisome. We see the police as the most effective arm of the system, but are they that honest and so utterly frustrated that they need to take the law in their own hands? But the movie does not disappoint on the action front. There is some great choreography and stunt-work, so long we have established that Devgn's guns never run out of bullets, and he can still manage 20 bad guys on his own. The comedic moments are genuinely bad, and gluttony being Avni's standout quality so we can understand how poorly written her character is, but Amol Gupte's Babaji is hilariously hammy, while for TV fans, there is CID's Daya in a meaty role. Singham Returns is yet another movie that espouses the thought that the only solution to crime is violence. Good idea? No. Entertaining? Maybe for some. Must watch? No." 
" The lions meows this time but Devgn does not disappoint","Bajirao Singham (ajay) gets transferred to Mumbai and he discovers that one of his team members (ganesh) is found dead with large bags of money. Bajirao decides to unearth the truth behind it and in this process, he collides with a powerful Swami ji (amole gupte) who has high profile connections with politicians. Whether Bajirao is able to overcome this challenge and clean the system or not forms the rest.The director has come up with an action packed story, but the plot was wafer thin and while the presentation was okay, the narrative was quite absorbing in parts, but boring in other parts.The dialogues were filled with good punch. The script was below average but the screenplay made it a little better. The background score was filled with good energy but songs could have been avoided. Cinematography was good but could have better. Editing was needed in some boring clichéd portions. Costumes were well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was mediocre. Ajay Devgn has carried out his role with elan and he has once again proved his mettle. Kareena Kapoor is bubbly and evokes laughter in film. Amole Gupte was fabulous, Anupam Kher was superb, Zakir Hussain was excellent, Dayanand Shetty was good, Sameer was standard, Vineet Sharma was neat. Others also contributed in a positive way and added value.Though the title sounds like a sequel, there is actually no connection with the original movie except that its hero and director have not changed. This film has a more realistic story but the plot is wafer thin and is dragged with many clichéd and ordinary scenes. The film showed promise in the beginning but dips a lot afterwards especially in the second half. The film entertains in parts mostly when Ajay Devgn is on screen performing his dramatic portions or his action sequences otherwise the film is ordinary and boring. Director Rohit Shetty fails to make SR better than the first, the spark is missing, the first was far more superior in drama and story. At the box office the film has started off historically but I believe all the hype will die done soon.Overall if you compare to the first you will be disappointed, otherwise its entertaining in parts. Watch if your a Ajay Devgn fan because he is roaring in the film with his performance. 2.5/5*" 
" Old Wine in New Bottle","Rohit Shetty is back with Singham Returns after Last years Chennai Express which was a blockbuster, Im not sure how like most his films. Singham Returns is not a remake of Singham 2(Tamil). However it is nothing novel or anything extraordinary. It follows the same formula,mixing it with Rohit Shetty nuisance stuff which works for his audiences like Ajay kicking 2 bikes and it banging another guy! C'mon If Sallu can do such stuff why not Ajay? The film has unrealistic situations though its issues are identifiable, the resolution isn't, like the end when an entire set of Inspectors go without their inform clad in Banyans to fight the politician. Even the romance track could be avoided,it looks forced and also some comic scenesDirection is nothing great, though some scenes are well handled Music is okay, though some songs seem forced Action scenes are typical though better then Singham OriginalAjay Devgn has a clichéd role but does it superbly, in fact much better then the previous one, Kareena Kapoor Khan is saddled with a forced character though she does her part superbly at times she does overact Dayanand Shetty repeats his CID act complete with name and similar stuff and is good,Ashwini Kalsekar too is good, Sharat Saxena gets hardly scope,Mahesh Manjerekar is good,Amol Gupte hams it up as Baba, Zakir Hussain is terrific, Anupam Kher has a brief role and is good Ganesh Yadav is good, rest are all okay" 
" The Lion Returns","Looking at the remakes in The Hindi film industry I can say Rohit she tty knows how to woo the audience. Yet another successful sequel of a south Indian film remake and the result is overwhelming. Ajay Devgnn is at his best and complemented by Amol Gupte and for a comic role Daya (CID Door Banger) and Kareena played the trick. The action scenes are really good unlike some of the movies where there is slow motion action picked scenes. Talking of storyline, Rohit Shetty tried a new wine in the same bottle and succeeded in creating a good , enjoyable movie. I personally enjoyed the theme music which is the same from Singham 1. I will give it a 7 star rating and is a good watch." 
" Positively dreadful.","How ironic is it that "Singham Returns," the lavishly produced, hammily acted and lazily directed sequel to a terrible blockbuster, will manage to rake in millions but be nothing but an astoundingly dimwitted film? The film's financial success was written before it was even released, for this film follows the ancient formula line by line and is carefully engineered to appeal to the masses. It revels in its own inaneness, expects its audiences to be as doltish as its characters and assimilate whatever 'whatsit' pretending to be a plot it pitches to them. And it drones on for more than two long, aging hours. "Singham Returns" is identical to its anarchistic predecessor in many ways; the outline of the plot, the sketches of the characters, the spectacularly over-the-top dialogue delivery and its inability to ever take itself seriously. But the argument can be made that "Singham Returns," much like its predecessor, is an overtly patriotic film. It tackles significant issues that are currently plaguing the nation and tries to give suitable answers to eradicate them. The problem doesn't lie in the answers; it lies in its failure to comprehend the graveness of these issues. The answers are wildly illogical, and though the film's intentions are admirable, it desperately begged for a touch of pragmatism.Rohit Shetty seems to have mastered the low-IQ action genre with films brimming with action, style and dynamite lines delivered with inspired vigor after every car explosion. This time, Singham (Ajay Devgn) faces competes with a crooked - aren't they all crooked? - politician (Zakir Hussain) and an equally twisted Swamiji (Amole Gupte) as they try to take over the city. His love interest, Avni (Kareena Kapoor, in a role that is often wasted in a film of this genre) wants to get married but appreciates his attempts to save the city from the grasps of the two obnoxious baddies. Though exhaustingly predictable and occasionally melodramatic, "Singham Returns" is a surprisingly serious film for the mainstream audience. There's not much space to squeeze a bit of humor in the proceedings, which is why the character of Avni is introduced - for a bit of needless buoyancy. She's loud, annoyingly chirpy and completely, completely irrelevant. Rohit Shetty deliberately extracts laughable, caricatural performances from the entire cast, and it was dismaying to see a truckload of talent wasted so offhandedly. But I had come to expect this since "Singham" wasn't known for its performances anyway.A vast section of the audiences will enjoy the stagy dialogues by Sajid-Farhad, I admit. There was applause and cheering when someone delivered a particularly catchy line in the screening I went to, so I expect this to be a case everywhere. The plotting is vacuous as usual, but what kind of plot does one expect from a gleefully dumb film?But what stood out in the film was the terrifically-executed shootout sequence about forty minutes in, the first of the two. It was uncommonly smart for a film that doesn't try very hard to impress, but it did redeem itself to an extent. In a nutshell, "Singham Returns" is only for fans of the first film and people who like to be called moronic, because this isn't a sequel for an audience who like a dash of intelligence in their entertainment. But - thankfully - it is not a manipulative film. The winsome intentions were in place. A bit of astuteness could have made this arduous excursion tolerable. I walked out with a feeling that my head was put together wrong." 
" Gives a clear message that sequels should strictly be made only if you have got something novel to add.","The first thought I had after watching SINGHAM RETURNS was, that is this really a Rohit Shetty film? The hit-machine's latest project with no spirited highs, no great entertaining moments, no jaw dropping action and all repeated seen before stuff served uninterestingly? Or to put it in different words, a product unlike Shetty, which was supposed to be a power packed entertaining explosion but sadly keeps dropping constantly till the end with no exceptional climax which was actually the USP of its first part.In short I found only three positive points in SINGHAM RETURNS. One the repetitive yet spirited performance of Ajay Devgun, second (thankfully) only two mediocre songs in the narrative and most importantly one particular sequence guiding the viewers about how a lady can only be arrested by the lady police officers alone as per the strict law.But apart from that, frankly I found nothing to be discussed in details as there is no novelty in the story progression at all and other than Ajay Devgun (and to some extent Mahesh Manjrekar & Anupam Kher) not even a single actor comes up with a worth mentioning act to be straight. In fact the two villains Amol Gupte and Zakir Hussain never seem to be any kind of powerful opponents as compared to Prakash Raj witnessed in the earlier part and no-one else in the supporting cast gets the attention of its writers too. Kareena remains the usual glamour doll in all forced in sequences falling flat and their love doesn't even seem to be a part of the film throughout.Hence this time Rohit is not well equipped with many enjoyable peaks in his script and the film keeps moving at the same level with no major twists & turns (with an excessive use of Marathi) shattering all reputation built by the director's earlier blockbusters. The action isn't any step ahead than his previous works and neither are the dialogues which formed the backbone of SINGHAM as everyone strongly remembers. Moreover both the cinematography and background score continuously give you an impression of 'Deja Vu' with nothing fresh or path breaking. So the part two is not able to surpass its prequel by any standards (including the scale) and putting it rightly this can easily be stated as a step backward, both in terms of execution as well as entertainment offered to its viewers.However with SINGHAM RETURNS, Rohit strangely tries to walk on the path of Madhur Bhandarkar in a different way by mocking few known personalities like Smriti Irani, Barkha Dutt, Asaram Bapu, a major political party and its leaders. The basic plot line reminded me of Chiranjeevi's PRATIBANDH released in 1990 and the climax made me recall Rupa's undergarments advertisement hilariously. The famous Daya from the never ending serial CID continues breaking the doors in the film too and it sounded quite weird to hear a devotional kind of song calling for the Almighty's help (at the Dargah) made purely like a love ballad with all slow western beats instead of a traditional Indianised rhythm.With a more than 140 minutes of duration, the film becomes all predictable and boring towards the end. Because of which as the Honey Singh song's started playing along with the credits, I was also whispering the same words in desperation saying Aata Majhi Satakli.in literal sense!So ending with a request to the reputed film-makers, the trend of sequel is acceptable only if the Part Twos and Threes have something novel, better and substantial to give to the viewers expecting a lot. Therefore please make any sequel only when you have got some newness to add to the hit concept, otherwise let it be." 
" Rohit Shetty only wants money nothing more....","SINGHAM RETURNS - Singham was a memorable film for me.....Not just because i liked it a lot but because it was the first movie for which i have given my first and a very short review i.e., - Singham - A must watch......But Singham Return will not be a memorable movie for me....Its not as one time watch like Kick ,,, shockingly it doesn't even reach to the level of what Dabang 2 have reached as a sequel .... Can u believe that m saying Dabang 2 was better movie as compared to Singham return as Ajay is my 2nd favorite actor of Bollywood and Salmaan is not even there in my favorite actor's list.... Rohit Shetty has ones said in an interview that i cant make a movie which gonna be flop ,, a lot of money has been invested by different producers on me and i have to pay them back.....At that time i thought that some how Rohit is telling a truth but after watching last year's Chennai Express and now Singham Returns i just want to ask Rohit - WHY U HAVE BECOME A DIRECTOR - TO MAKE GOOD MOVIES AND ENTERTAIN AUDIENCE OR JUST TO EARN A LOT OF MONEY TO REPAY YOUR PRODUCERS BY MAKING THE AUDIENCE FOOL.......Rohit should rethink about his work...... Singham Returns is another sequel which just wants to gross a lot of money in the name and success of its 1st installment....... M not a person who dislike Rohit Shetty's movie.......I liked all Golmaal movies(including Golmaal Returns which a lot of people say was not a good movie) , i liked ALL THE BEST (Excluding its climax.- for me all the best have a worst climax i have ever seen) , i like Singham a lot ,, infect i have also liked his debut flop ZAMEEN ,,,, but after Singham when Bol Bachan was released i find it average......Obviously no director can make all his movies good ,, it was entertaining in parts....Then he comes up with Chennai Express which i disliked a lot ,, but i thought it was SRK who doesn't fit as a comical hero.....But finally after Singham Returns i have to say that blame is totally on Rohit Shetty ,, he is now at his downfall.....Rohit ones have his own brand of cinema which no other director can make ,, but instead of making himself better he is using same formula again and again and again...... This movie doesn't have any new thing in its story- Singham has been promoted to Mumbai Police where there is a political scenario going on ,, and there is a good side and there is a bad side.....Bad side includes a politician and a Godman - Dhongi Baba (played by Amol Gupte in a non satisfactory manner) ..... The villains in the movie are so foolish that they doesn't have any plan to tackle with the police department when they will be caught......And it feels like they have been caught very easily by our super hero Singham...... There are so many things which seems like we are watching some movie from 80s and 90s.....-a God Man who although is a bad person but people being superstition follows them,,,,a politician as a villain too who is more foolish rather being an intelligent who can challenge our hero ,,, same police department who can't work without orders of their head , reporters who doesn't come when police gets medal but comes when same person is caught with a lot of money ,,, this list can go long way..... The drama is not engaging,,,,and the background scores while action scenes were too loud which irritates a lot.....Infect the slow motion scenes are so irritating that u have too wait them to finish....For example every time Singham walks out of the car to arrest a criminal he walks in a slow motion with Singham Singham in background score and u have to wait a lot so that he will cover the distance to reach the place where criminal was standing.... And the dialogs ,, a lot and a lot have been repeated for Singham 1 which have already looses their charm......Rohit Shetty should understand that u cant repeat everything of a prequel made few years back..... Then there is the unnecessary romantic track ,, I don't understand why to cast Kareena Kapoor if she has to do the same thing what Kajal Agarwal has done in first part....Songs are not important and should not have been in the movie in-spite of being good as for listening(m not counting not so interesting honey singh track).... Then there comes action which is no doubt very well done as this is a Rohit Shetty film,,,,but then again its same old action which doesn't show u anything new like what - QAYAMAT or WANTED or GAJANI have shown in their time.... Comedy is very less which has always been the high point of Rohit Setty's movie,,,,instead this time he tries to spread some social knowledge this time.....For me if u want to make a movie on serious issues than make a serious movie on it,,,,its useless to fit such things in out and out Masala movie. And lastly i would like to say the movie although raises some good questions doesn't even answer a single of them,,,,and even if it has tried to answer some ,, such answers are only good for movie not for real world.... ROHIT SHETTY please make movies like u use to make sometimes earlier......don't fool us....we like u.....don't take advantage of it.....6.2/10....It can be a one time watch but not at all in theater....At least you can forward the boring scenes in your laptop.... by ANuP APu KuMaR" 
" Spare The Horror. ♦ 14%","The film gradually builds up to become a torture.If you have watched Singham, then consider that you have watched Singham Returns as well, because other than few character build ups and Devgn's weight loss, nothing has changed in the film filled with explosions, gunfires and cliché.It is a good example of "been there, done that" type of cinema which uses the same old technique of storytelling about a grumpy villain and a crowd-backed hero. And at the end, we all know who wins. While Ajay Devgn is average as the titular hero, I may totally stop watching future Kareena Kapoor films.Jab We Met was fine, but her over- acting shoots up the star here, annoying as ever when she shares the screen space. Amol Gupte is fine, although I hated his non-vindictive character who looks more like a joker.The blame is on the writers for creating half-baked characters who fool around with the janta who are both shrewd and dumb at the same time. It samples various current affair elements but provides no explanation or solution, other than violence and selfish righteousness. I can understand the emotion behind the film-making and releasing it on Independence Day, but when the plot lacks substance and logic, deviating extensively from reality, I wonder if the definition of cinema has not been understood by the makers.It is a crime in itself in expecting good stuff from Rohit Shetty, but after the prequel, I was expecting something powerful from this franchise. I also don't know whether it is an exact remake of the Tamil version, but hell, I don't even care anymore. The first half is average, but the scenes after the interval is either the chants of "Singham, Singham" played as Devgn walks here and there or eye-straining melodrama. And what's with the superficial touch of Marathi and its infamous expletives?BOTTOM LINE: There's not a single point that I can write about this film that will stand as a reason for me to recommend it. And if it's the Indian Constitution's IPC or CrPC that you are interested in, why don't you buy the book and spare this horror?Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" bajirao singham back with a Bang......","This time singham (ajay devgan) returns as deputy commissioner of police. The movie gets more good with supporting actors like anupam kher, kareena kapoor and Daya.... the fight is not against one villain its about one honest and fearless officer tackles with politics people. the dailogue screen play and stunts are great as usual for which Rohit Shetty (director) is known. kareena plays role of girl in love with ajay devgan and girl who is full of fun. The fight against evil is not tough but singam leaves nothing to win this battle to wipe out crime. And one should not forget his famous dialogue ''Aataa Majhi Satakli''..its complete entertainment for audience who loves fighting with little comic thing. In a nutshell it is a movie that one should not miss...." 
" A step down from the first","I liked singham very much so my expectations with this movie were very high.Upto some extents this movie fulfilled my expectations.This movie was not completely boring as well as was not very great but was entertaining.The story was nothing new but its approach is fresh.Good cop fighting against corruption is certainly not a new idea and we have watched it before many times on silver screen still it looks fresh.Rohit shetty's movies are known for their fun and excitement but this movie lacks it.Comedy is the worst part of this movie followed by its music.The film is filled with action scenes for which proper situations has not been created that's why after sometimes they feel irritating.In acting AJ was just OK.The aggression which he showed in Singham was superb but this time he misses it.Kareena was very bad.She overacted too much.Her hammy acting was SO irritating.Climax of the movie was unbelievably over the top.The plot also contained some plot holes but could be forgot because screenplay is smooth and keeps you entertained.I never felt boring while watching it.I loved the music of Singham but this movie is too weak in this department.Rohit shetty has always made mindless but entertaining movies appealing to masses as well as classes and this movie is no exception but this movie lacks the trademark humour present in rohit's movies which makes it a little weaker as compared to his previous films.Still it is an enjoyable movie for action lovers.If you are an AJ's fan then you will surely like it. RATING : 6.9 out of 10" 
" Much worse than the first film (Singham)","Wow. How can Ajay Devgn get things so wrong with a formula that was already working? The original Singham film, from 2011, was successful at the box office but that didn't make it special, since many mediocre films in India find commercial success. What made Singham special was that it was a genuinely watchable film on some levels despite being a mass entertainer. In my opinion, the following factors (among others) made the original Singham film very good:1) Ajay-Atul's music. Singham only had three tracks and each was very good. The title track was especially a stand-out2) Kajal Aggarwal. Her beauty, charm, elegance and the-girl-next- door-like approachable quality made it easy to fall in love with her as you got to know her character better. The film's romantic story track, which might otherwise have been forgettable, was definitely elevated by many miles because of her presenceGuess what? Singham Returns doesn't have either of the above factors! Both the music composers and the lead actress were replaced by sub- par choices. You just have to listen to the title song of Singham Returns to know what I mean. Unlike the first film's title song, this song reminded me of beggars belting out tunes at India's railway stations.And Kareena Kapoor was the replacement for Kajal Aggarwal? Why? Seriously, why? If Ajay Devgn had convinced his wife and once-upon- a-time reigning queen of Indian cinema, Kajol, to act opposite him in Singham Returns, then maybe he could have gotten a pass for not having Kajal Aggarwal in this film. That itself is a pretty big 'maybe'. But Kareena Kapoor? She lacks the attractiveness, charm and presence of Kajal Aggarwal. The romantic story track became totally hackneyed and forgettable once again, as they often are in mass action films.In fact the entire film became forgettable. The first Singham film was interspersed with Ajay-Atul's stand-out compositions and Kajal Aggarwal's ability to make you fall in love her with every scene. Singham Returns, on the other hand, makes you want to fast-forward through the songs and Kareena scenes so you can get back to the boring action scenes." 
" Nonsense movie","I loved Singham (part 1) movie, but this movie has brought a lot of disappointment to me. The script was good, acting was good, locations were good, then what went wrong? Well, it didn't make much sense to me when the police department regularly visits Dargah/mosque to solve their case. Are you serious?? Why police department needs to pray in Dargah for solving their case, despite the fact that constitution is a different thing and religions are different thing. Worst is, most of the police are shown as Hindus and they goes to mosque for prayers, and there comes a miracle they get culprit out of coma hahaha. Do they don't believe in their own religion? Secularism is good, but this is utter nonsense. This movie shows that our police are of no use, as almost all the time police department fails in this movie and when all of them resigns from their duty they wins. LOL.. Seriously? Singham fails in protecting VIP person, fails in presenting a culprit to court and instead risked many police life in danger.After success of Singham (part 1), Chennai express, it seems Rohit shetty has lost his mind by giving secular colors in a movie which has nothing to do with religions. Hahahaha, brings more comedy than action." 
" Below Par of High mounted Expectations::: Avoidable","There is nothing new in this flick. Having seen the superb south Indian (Tamil) version of Singham 2 (A sequel to singham, both brilliantly presented by Hari, starring Surya) rented this film with a lot of expectations. First few minutes told me what was to be expected, but still I waited to see whether this got any connections with the first singham movie other than the name hero (and his name), or does this have anyway related to Tamil version of Singham 2, and ... nothing... that was it! I was totally disappointed.My opinion for the viewers is that TO BE AVOIDED iff you are expecting a sequel to first successful singham."
