" An interesting film...but something's missing","'Dansh' is an interesting film but the plot line is very similar to 'Death and the Maiden'. I haven't read the book nor seen the film (which I've been wanting to do fora while). I would like to see how similar they are.Set in the state of the North Indian state of Mizoram 'Dansh' briefly deals with political conflict and the aftermath. It's pretty much a thriller about a woman and her husband who keep a doctor hostage in their house. The woman accuses the doctor of brutally raping her.Though i liked the way that the film was trying to deal with facing one's past, there was just something missing to make it more 'hard hitting'. I can't exactly point what that is though.The background score contributes well. Verma's direction is consistent and she does not focus on any insignificant subplot. The performances are very good. Kay Kay Menon is excellent again as he owns all his scenes. Sonali Kulkarni is very good (though a very few times she seems to lack spontaneity). Aditya Srivastav is adequate.As a film itself, Dansh isn't bad to watch." 
" a thoughtful approach.","It is one of the rare intelligent movies. some of the the dialogues are unbelievable as i never expected such quality from a bollywood movie. very thoughtful and worth watching. central characters lead good performance. thinking on negative front could be that lyrics and music are not so great. performance by supporting cast could be distracting some times. the conflict between personal and social responsibilities is captured. movie indeed is a gentle reminder that it is possible to leave impact without huge budget. At the same time, it is sad that sch movies don't get the deserving acclaim. there is no specific high point in movie as it peaks throughout."
