" D grade bollywood","Let me begin by saying that trailers portray an entirely different overview of a film. When I watched the trailer for this movie I assumed it would be an entertaining horror flick. I assumed wrong. The story is your average "ghost taking possession of a body" leading towards suicide of the possessed person, cop interrogating the death & a religious person solving the mystery. The plot is weak, dialogues are not well written, the direction is amateur and the camera work is clumsy. If you absolutely adore horror genre and have 2 hours to waste then be my guest and watch this film but let me warn you, it will be boring."
