" Anamika is an average thriller","Anamika is the worst kind of thriller film you're likely to see; it's the kind of thriller whose suspense you can predict the moment the film's plot and characters have been set up. Twenty minutes in and you know exactly who is hiding what secret. You can imagine then, how difficult it is sitting through the remaining two hours of this lousy film! Faithful for the most part to the premise and structure of Hitchcock's Rebecca, of which this film is a shameless rip-off, Anamika revolves around the newly married wife of a Rajasthani royal whose first wife was killed under mysterious circumstances not so long ago. Constantly under pressure to step into the shoes of the first wife, and haunted by other people's recollections of her predecessor, our protagonist finds her own marriage under threat as she becomes obsessed with unraveling the mystery behind the first wife's death. Directed rather indifferently by Ananth Narayan Mahadevan, the film flounders when it digresses from the original plot of Rebecca and comes up with its own ridiculous climatic twist. Indeed that twist is so obvious, a seven-year-old could sniff it from a distance. Often even average films work because the characters drive the plot. Things turn out the way they do because the characters are who they are. Anamika might not have turned out this bad had the film's cast performed their roles convincingly. But Dino Morea simply doesn't have the maturity required to play the husband who everyone's suspicious of. He mutters his dialogues and has a vacant expression throughout, at best coming off as a model for those fancy designer suits he wears in the film. Minnisha Lamba doesn't do too badly as the new bride forced to confront those ugly truths, but saddled with such a one-dimensional role, there's little she can achieve here. But it's Koena Mitra, cast as the housekeeper, who can't stop glossing over the first wife's virtues, who is the film's final fatal flaw. To put it politely, acting is not her vocation. Slower than a sixty-year-old on crutches, the screenplay of Anamika plods along laboriously, further slackened by Anu Malik's ridiculous score, which includes such eardrum-splitting songs as Shagufta Dil and Tera Saath, both recorded in his own distinct voice. If you're looking for a tight, razor-sharp, edge-of-the-seat thriller, you've got the wrong film. If you do decide to go see it, take a pillow to rest your head when you doze off midway." 
" OK movie till climax","Another trying to be different movie from Anant, his past were good but this one below the expectation. The movie is about a Mumbai girl (Minisha Lamba) who marries to rich guy from Rajasthan, Vikram (Dino). Vikram a widower whose first wife disappears mysteriously, takes his newly wedded wife ti Gajner and from there her quest to know about Anamika (first wife of Vikram) starts and leads to a hopeless end. Movie gets some speed but the looks like director was confused about how to end the movie. Due to small character list, you will easily predict the killer among suspect. Strongest point of the movie is Rajasthan, else its below avg movie in most of the department, including music. Anu Malik should retire now. Watch it, if you want to spend some time with OK kind of movie. Though I am usually kind in rating but my 5* to this movie." 
" Great Suspense Movie!","I am failing to understand all the criticism that is being made toward this movie? I just watched it, and found it to be highly entertaining, suspenseful and a feast for the eyes. It has two stunningly gorgeous female leads in Minissha Lamba and Koena Mitra, a good looking hero in Dino Morea, exquisite locales of the Rajasthan desert and dazzling beauty of the castle shown. The mystery unfolds gradually, step by step, and the suspense quotient is pretty high throughout. Gulshan Grover does his usual swashbuckling role with panache, and the beautiful ladies provide plenty of eye candy for the male viewers. The music and songs are melodious and memorable, with Shaan providing his inimitable voice for many numbers. Do watch it, it is pretty good!"
