" Two hot babes, one okay comedy","The dangerous duo of Mallika Sherawat and diva Rekha show their girl power like never before in this comedy. Rekha, of course, is awesome. She performed the role of the French woman particularly well. Mallika also gives a good performance for a change. Both actresses are looking better than ever in this film. Their good rapport communicates onto the screen. The story is fresh. Songs are good. The best is most definitely "Tera Husn." Kunal Ganjawala did an awesome job singing it, the cinematography is stunning and vibrant, and Mallika looks terrific in it. The movie started to become a drag towards the end. However, the lovely cinematography in the foreign locales, fresh music, and the awesome combination of Rekha and Mallika make this a light-hearted entertainer." 
" Cheap, silly, unoriginal, but it's not that bad actually","Every film is worth watching for Rekha, and the lady proves yet again she can lead a film no matter how bad it is or how old she herself is. And indeed, Bachke Rehna Re Baba is a poor copy of a Hollywood movie - Heartbreakers (which in itself was quite crappy), but Rekha is wonderful in another sexy comic role, which evidently she invested much energy into. Bachke Rehna Re Baba is, as mentioned, cheap, silly and unoriginal. The writing is for the most part bad and it offers a great share of embarrassing moments, but then again, it's not as bad as some have suggested and is quite a decent one-time watch. The film never takes itself too seriously, it is lighthearted, the music is nice, and some of the locales are breathtaking. Of course the big plus was the presence of Rekha. Many have been critical of her work in this film (which I think has got to do more with the quality of the film rather than her actual performance). Playing a middle-aged con woman must be a tiresome clich√©, but sexy Ms. Rekha is hilarious here and is still sizzling and attractive, making everything work just fine and proving her mettle as a true comedienne. You must see how brilliantly she handles a certain scene in which she is forced to taste an octopus and hide her total disgust, or her own singing for a number called "Eiffel Tower", which is awesome and funny. The combination with Mallika Sherawat is also effective, and boy, this Sherawat babe is just so smashing hot that her lack of true acting talent does not even come to mind while watching this. Paresh Rawal is one of my favourites, so all's good as far as casting goes. No doubt this is no some great film, but it's watchable enough, and is much better than what I had personally prepared myself for. Nice, silly fun." 
" Another Hollywood copy, nothing else","This time, Bollywood decided to copy "Heartbreakers", starring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Rekha plays the role of Sigourney Weaver and since she's a senior actress, plays it good. On the other hand, Mallika Sherawat is no Jennifer Love Hewitt. I don't know how long will Bollywood keep making their versions of Hollywood movies? Isn't there any law that can forbid them from stealing stories and scripts from Hollywood and taking all credit for it? Why do people accept them as original work? How long would we watch the copied movies? Not a surprise from Bollywood though, after all there name was also "inspired" by Hollywood."
