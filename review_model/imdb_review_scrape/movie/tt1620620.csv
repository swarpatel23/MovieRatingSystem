" Made my day","I am big fan of Aparna sen. i don't understand Bengali but that doesn't stop me watching this movie. its journey to meaningful cinema where you can experience the character from within. its about a small village teacher become postal friend to a Japanese girl and their relationship bonds over through letters. withe the passage of time they marry each other from within and stay committed to each other.this is going to stay in your mind for long time. one of the best movies i have seen. Rahal Bose and Mausami is class. Raima Sen is first class. cinematography is extremely wonderful. hats of to the director for choosing wonderful location to shoot. this is for sure a great movie in every aspect. Indian cinema at best." 
" simple flavour of romance","Aparna Sen did it again or to be precise even better than before. What all ingredients you want in a romantic movie, probably you won't find them in The Japanese Wife. But more importantly they have a story to tell and they told it very subtly.Snehamoy (Rahul Bose) a school teacher in an Indian village fell in love Miyage (Chigusa Takaku) through the medium of letters; and so does Miyage. That love turns to marriage and hence starts their married life without seeing each other in person. There are many movies with similar theme, but most of them ends here. That's the different, this movie starts with their marriage. It was refreshing to see how they carry forward their marriage on letters. There are only letters for first half and hour or so. There are lovely little village incidents (kite flying, etc.) all through the movie. And ended on a perfect note.Full marks to Rahul Bose for getting in Snehamoy's skin. Convincing performance from rest of the cast. The best part about the movie is quite vivid and imaginative use of props, background and music.Though I am not a big fan of romantic movies. I enjoyed the movie to the core with my limited Bengali. Try and get a copy with English subtitle if possible.Take away - watch it till the end, u'll be reward." 
" Platonic Love","In a poor island in the countryside of India, the school teacher Snehamoy Chatterjee (Rahul Bose) becomes the pen friend of the Japanese Miyage (Chigusa Takaku). When his aunt Mashi (Moushumi Chatterjee) wants to marry him with the young Sandhya (Raima Sen), he engages in a marriage commitment with Miyage that becomes his Japanese wife. However, neither he can afford to travel to Japan nor Miyage can leave her old mother alone to travel to India. Meanwhile Sandhya marries and has a son.After fifteen years, she gets widowed and moves to Mashi's house. But Snehamoy is still married with Miyage without seeing each other. When his Japanese wife has cancer, Snehamoy consults Indians doctors trying to find a cure for Miyage. Will they finally be together after all those years? "The Japanese Wife" is a delicate romance about platonic love. The original story is very beautiful, despite the sad and unpredictable conclusion, and for Westerns like me it is a chance to see the costumes and behavior of the Indians. The music score is also very beautiful and suits perfectly to the film. I just regret that the responsible for the subtitles have not noticed that yellow subtitles in white background are absolutely illegible. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available" 
" human relations in a non-capitalistic society.","The film is excellent. I don't clasify it as a romantic film. I think it's a film about human relationships and values. People from western (the so-called 'developted') countries, cannot even understand the behavior in such societies. So you may read some comments that the film is not ...realistic (!), or so. Hollywood film watchers have totally lost the ability to understand a piece of art. The first think that comes to mind is that money in such societies is not the goal but just a mean. Kindness, generosity. support etc prevail. Love is pure and without expecting something in return. This is not the exception but the rule. This is not something artificial, as people in west may think. It's a result of the social construction, (the lack of capitalism if you prefer a political or economical term). If seen under this perspective everything is easily understood: Why the aunt is so supportive, the devotion that Snehamoy has to his 'wife', the attitude of the widow, both against Snehamoy and his 'wife', at the end of the film. The directing is pretty good, and so I think for the acting. I really enjoyed and I heartily recommend it." 
" great movie from India","You won't take your eyes off the screen from the opening scene to the closing credits of "The Japanese Wife." Although this is a simple love story, it's visual style and look reminded me of another great Indian film, "Water" which also had a female director, Deepa Mehta. Aparna Sen, the director of "The Japanese Wife" uses the visual beauty of India, especially the rivers, as effectively as the cinematography of "Water." The acting is superb, as Rahul Bose and Chigusa Takaku as the star-crossed spouses are excellent. The supporting cast, mainly the aunt (Moushoumi Chatterjee) and a little boy(Rudranil Ghosh) are both very good. The story is a very basic one showing 2 people of vastly different cultures falling in love via letter writing. The universal message of loneliness and yearning are depicted in a very interesting way.Even as a cynical American, I cannot recommend this film highly enough." 
" it will take u into their world .......as it continues.......","first i would miss it if i would not be suggested by my friend ..thank god..i didn't.....it is such a wonderful movie with great acting,direction and the environment they set up,i have never seen in Indian movies this year.gradually the story continues..it will hold on to your mind gracefully.everybody in this film played their character very well and Rahul bose..he is an excellent.apart from "mr & mrs iyer","15th park avenue"..this film is "one piece" of its kind.aparna sen has again showed her quality as a director in this film.i would say,this is not the genre that everybody will like it.but the love story and the representation of the simple story ..is such that you should watch it at least once,then you will know the charm of this film. yes,i would recommend tat you should watch the film without any "second thought"." 
" grows on you, subtly vivid with a brilliant story","I watched this movie when i was in a mood to watch some light hearted bolly-holly cross movie, without reading anything about it. And at the end it turns out that I myself am writing about it. I haven't yet watched Satyajit Ray's "Apu" trilogy, but I have got a feeling that i have already watched him in color. The main strength of the movie is its unpretentious aura, wrapped within a simple story. What makes the whole thing grandeur is the dream like subtlety that the viewer sees through the portrayal of reality. Actors (especially Extras), Cinematographer, Musicians, Screenwriters and the Director have all struck the right chord." 
" Lyricism in Love","The malleability of the plausible emotions of the lead characters of the film under the director's realistic hammer blows is one of the features which makes 'The Japanese Wife' a treat to watch. The slow pace touches upon the various chords of a sensible heart. The two star-crossed spouses residing in far-off places fall in love and eventually marry without actually meeting each other in person, yet their love is far more loyal and inextricable than those lovers or spouses who stay together. But, their simple lifestyle and righteousness do them in at last. Poetic justice is not meted out and this makes the plot all the more plausible. Given the profound dynamism and the many facets of human emotions that run crisscross along the length & breadth of the movie, one is sure to identify with the pristine humanity of the characters. Minimalism in music and natural, yet far from being a dime a dozen, musically lyrical words and sentences coupled with a haunting silence of death touch up the aggravating pathos of the characters till the very end." 
" Awesome Movie","The Japanese Wife is quite different from what we generally see in the trash of Bollywood. The use of symbolism in various scenes is quite evident in the movie. Though I find the scenario of the Bengali village very backward, may be because I am from metropolis. This is a brilliant piece of work by the crew. It is a Love story that is the only thing I want to tell as I don't want to spoil the fun of watching it. Meaning of the Love and Marriage is redefine in it. The only disappointment is that there is the use of Bangla/Bengali language in major part of the movie which I as an non-Bengali unable to understand. But even then it evoke emotions within me. And I took the whole pain of registering here on this website just to write that it is a MUST WATCH movie. Hoping that distributors might be giving some subtitle along with the DVD for this movie." 
" Slow and deliberate....but rewarding.","Before you decide to watch this movie on DVD, there is something you might want to know. The subtitles are in difficult to read font and are yellow, and at times, they are a bit hard to read. It's hard to imagine that the people distributing the film would do such a haphazard job of captioning the film--and it's a shame.The plot of this film is a lot like the Anne Bancroft/Anthony Hopkins film, "84 Charing Cross Road" in that it is told through a very long series of letters back and forth between the male and female lead. Despite having a very strong attachment, the male and female leads go for many years without seeing each other! Muyage is a woman living in Japan. Snehamoy is a Bengali man living in India and most of the film is shown from his perspective. They are pen pals and through the course of the film they exchange many letters which are narrated for the audience. Over time, they fall in love but cannot do much about it, as they are both poor. Yet, because they are so painfully shy, they do not see anyone in their own country. Eventually they hit on the idea of getting married--though they still have not actually met...and even after their marriage (there is no actual ceremony) they do not meet! Years pass this way as they exchange letters and grow separately...yet together.Problems arise, however, when a widow and her young son move in with him and his aunt. After all, this widow is the same lady that the aunt tried to get Snehamoy to marry years earlier. She, like Snehamoy, is painfully shy...but you can also very slowly see something might be blossoming between them...very, very slowly. And, you can also see the young boy beginning to bond more and more with Snehamoy--seeing him as a bit of a father figure. In the meantime, Miyage becomes ill--so ill that Snehamoy is worried she will die, so he takes off time from work and runs from doctor to healer to try to get them to diagnose a woman living 3600 miles from India (trust me, I recently measured it)! What will become of these nice people? Overall, I was very impressed by the very slow and deliberate pace of the film. It was obviously a labor of love, though some might be a bit put off by the very restrained and emotionally constricted acting. It is a film about people--not about action or great displays of emotion. As a result, I assume many, if not most viewers (who are unfortunately boobs) probably will not enjoy the film very much and much of the film's beauty and artistry will be lost on them. Yes, I am apparently a snob and assume the worst of many viewers--especially teens and the chronically dumb. But, if you are willing to watch such a film, give this one a try. It's original (despite its similarity to this other film) and engaging...if you give it a chance. Just be forewarned, this film, at times, is rather heart-breaking--it's not a predictable romantic feel-good film. Seriously...think about this before picking this film.By the way, there was one aspect of the film I did NOT love. Seeing the male lead apparently masturbating in one scene was kind of yucky. No, they didn't show this but it was clear this was occurring. I did, however, like a scene soon after this where you THINK this is occurring...but it isn't. That's pretty clever." 
" Beautiful and poignant","The Japanese Wife is an exquisitely crafted film, with the entire emotional gamut of a love story so unbelievable and yet so touching and universal distilled onto the silver screen. The performances are heart-rending and so realistic that the viewer is just pulled completely into the characters' world. From the restrained turbulence of Raima Sen to the poignancy of Chigusa Takaku, this film probably marks complete departures in roles for its entire cast. The direction is expectedly superb from Aparna Sen as each scene seems to sigh with the beauty of the Sunderbans and delicately fashion each character in the landscape.Most interesting for me was the subtle way in which the film tried to make a point about xenophobia and the stupidity of people who adhere to it. When Miyage sends over a box of kites for their 15th wedding anniversary which Snehamoy intends to fly at the Vishwakarma Puja, the sporting kite war is turned into shouts of "Bharater ghuri Zindabad! Japaner ghuri Murdabad!" from one ignorant tramp, which then another ignorant tramp turns into "Duniyar mazdur ek ho!".In all, a triumph for the cast, crew and for romantics who dare to believe in the impossible. A must see." 
" The perfect title so as the plot","Excellent plot and very touchy movie I have watched after a long time. Thank you thank you thank you to Aparna Sen and everyone worked for this movie. Even in today's modern techno era she is giving a nice message through a simple yet ever lasting movie. Rahul, Mousomi and Raima are excellent in their respective roles.This movie is about a pen friendship between a guy (Rahul) of very very rural area of West Bengal, India and a girl (Chigusa) from Japan. They fall in love and marry by exchanging letters. They were committed to each other. That's how the title came - The Japanese Wife. The wife came to W.B, India to meet her husband after 17 years of marriage (through letter) but what's waiting there...you must watch. Hope you'll enjoy.Note: Most of the letter conversations are in English and it has a sub title as well. So folks who don't know Bengali, shouldn't be a problem.Thanks!" 
" A different movie","I watch the movie with my family. It is a totally different movie than ones we use to. It is totally character movie without big budget but it really surprised us how the feelings touched us." 
" Haiku as "it ends before it starts"",""One day I will come to you floating down this river (river Matla) just like a sailing boat" a platonic love that needs no technical gizmos and beyond the constrains of cultural, language, distance, social dogmas .... 'A rare gem' as many film makers call this movie, a poignant story, a smooth soft flow .." 
" No depth, story or punchline","It is another pseudo artistic movie. I watched hoping being an Aparna Sen movie it should be good, but was disappointed.It lacks story, acting as well as punchline. Reema is totally wasted. There is no depth nor details. Instead of Japanese it could have easily been Mumbai wife. How they became pen-friends remains a mystery. There is old style thunderstorm and rain to emphasize something bad is going to happen. Despite being relatively short movie, it is tiring and unrealistic. There is a young guy and a young widow living under one roof with no hot outcome ... totally unrealistic in today's world.Overall, it is an avoidable movie. Be ready to be disappointed." 
" You'd do well to divorce yourself from as much contact with this film as possible; a droll and misplayed drama which does not work.","I've little doubt that Aparna Sen has produced his 2010 film The Japanese Wife with the best of intentions; the piece covering the exploits of two people and the love they share across a vast distance, without ever actually being able to meet. The film aims for swooping; sweeping; love-lorn imbued romance of grandeur proportions that it believes will have a greater effect on its audience than it does in reality, a piece covering those sharing a seemingly impossible tie across such a great distance and yet having the maintaining of such a relationship look later like the least of each of their respective woes. What it more often than not resembles, however, is a trite; television disease movie of the week - a film that has all but lost us by the end as little more than a contrived and limply made drama, sickly easing its way from sentimental set piece to set piece as these people come together to softly spoken narration and warmly lit locales.The film covers that of young Indian Snehamoy (Bose), a single gentleman with a penchant for maths whom lives alone with his cat on a rural patch of land in a village not too far from a more hustling, bustling town of activity. Snehamoy latches onto a system encompassing long distance relationships with other pen-pals – people of whom wish to exchange letters and so on; a sort of lonely hearts club for people wanting to look abroad or over a longer distance for potential love and kinship. With this arrives the (eventual) titular Japanese wife, named Miyage (Takaku), as well as the long distance relationship that makes up the crux of the film. It's here, despite the modern setting, the film rejects the notion of more contemporarised means of communications; settling for pen and paper over e-mail or social networking and thus gambling on etching as much effect as possible out of such means – a gamble I was wanting to come through, but doesn't. With it, we are to suspend our belief that, despite Japan being somewhat of a hub for global technology – technology encompassing annoying innovations that actually make it easier for one to communicate, the Japanese based Miyage will engage in the premise that she does for ideas and thought exchange.It is established Snehamoy has already beaten malaria on three separate occasions, so the man is a fighter or someone used to striving on through relatively tough, testing times; the film really kicking off when Miyage arrives on the scene and the exchanges begin in earnest. The plot, suffice to say there barely is one, consists of Snehamoy and Miyage exchanging letters and getting along relatively swimmingly amidst the relationship Snehamoy shares with his aunt, with whom he sees eye to eye more often than not. That's it, that's practically the entire story. The bond works too quickly between Snehamoy and his Japanese contact, they fall in love over one another's written word and exchange marriage vows before maintaining that trust across fifteen years; the leap forwards providing the audience with little in the way of time to allow for their marriage to resonate and falsifying the naturalistic feel to their ties the film aims for.Around it, a meaningless and entirely fruitless exercise in melodramatics transpires; two people getting along wonderfully well, but kept apart by the distance between them, continuing to exchange letters and continuing their lives made tougher only by the fact social interaction with others is difficult. They deduce travelling to see one another is challenging, the exchange rate between the Japanese and Indian currencies rather vast and yet at no point does Miyage ever offer to pay for Snehamoy's air-fare for a bond that is supposedly so intense. The Indian telephone lines down at Snehamoy's end are usually rife with demons, making communication there quite tough and keeping the written word the only means through which to communicate. Letters are sent and letters are received; and then more letters are sent and then the damn things are narrated, because static shots of pieces of paper for long durations I guess isn't interesting; and we wonder if these people are really eloquent enough to put down the things they write or whether we are hearing a screenwriter's fifth draft of a hodge-podge script.Later, Snehamoy has what can only be described as a "kite-off" with some fellow Indians whilst using the Japanese kites his wife has sent him. Snehamoy, being as qualified in mathematics as he is, and with that coming the required knowledge in sums; volume; mass and formulae, is able to have this "kite-off" on a day in which there is very little wind – work that one out. These fellow Indians, whose own kites see them label the contest one of national pride, induce antagonism against Snehamoy because of his tryst with Miyage; sources of antagonism which stand alone and unchallenged in what is a fairly interesting area for such things, one of which might have seen the exploring of ill-judged prejudices people have against both inter-racial relations and cross-cultural bonds. Surprisingly, Sen backs off from such a thematic; instead offering us flat, banal alternatives.Later on, Snehamoy's aunt, whom through some convoluted means, introduces a young woman to proceedings; a female character that appears to fall at Snehamoy's feet and comes equipped with a daughter Snehamoy bonds well with. However she, like us, can only continue to observe Snehamoy stick to some undying principal that has him loyal to his Japanese wife of a decade-plus; the whole thing feeling like an odd glorification of speeding up one's romantic ties, through whatever means, when the waiting and allowing natural enough processions to play out with those in proximity to you, and to what would have been a charming scenario of romance with this new woman, appearing evident. Stale; repetitive and really rather misjudged in the places it goes, The Japanese Wife is one to skip."
