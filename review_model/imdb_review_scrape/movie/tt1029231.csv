" Stupid and hilarious!!","As much as I adore "Koi ..... Mil Gaya" (2003) and "Krrish" (2006), I loathe their sequel i.e. the abomination named "Krrish 3". The first movie was influenced a lot by "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" (1982) and "Spider-Man" (2002). However, it had a story to tell and it did. Similarly, "Krrish" was pretty much influenced by the principles of Batman from "Batman Begins" (2005), a lot of actions from "The Matrix" (1999) among many other popular superhero films. It told a good origins story and was fine on the whole. And one more thing, their target audience were mainly the kids, so they were enjoyable enough as kids movies. But this movie? Oh hell no! Unlike the first two, it tries to be more than it is - an epic superhero movie of all times. This, despite (in its core) being a kids movie, feels like a cheesy rehash of some bad Hollywood superhero movies. As a kid's movie, it's something that even the kids will consider to be dumb, compared to other films made for them. It is superbly lazily written. It has no story inside it, the major plot points being ripped off of "X-Men: The Last Stand" (2006) mainly. That was the most commercially successful X-Men film at that time, and at the same time a pile of stinking trash. Since Bollywood wants to make money, they copied shamelessly from that movie. A lot of things are similar to "The Avengers" (2012) and "Man of Steel" (2013) regarding the destruction that takes place in the movie. There are some desi plotlines in this movie that feel incredibly hilarious. Just to make it look different, they made use of the same old story elements that is predictable to say the least. Leaving aside the Hollywood ripoff things, it creates a huge number of plot holes and inconsistencies regarding the franchise. The way Rohit speaks after the events of the first film doesn't explain itself. He was intelligent but still foolish after the events. And Krrish's powers are still not explained, which feel like the over amplification of Rohit's powers. In this movie, it feels like Krrish is a love child of Superman, Batman and The Flash rather than Rohit's son. Kangana plays the love child of Shadowcat and Mystique. Vivek Oberoi who looks like an illegal son of Saif Ali Khan in this movie, plays the love child of (drumrolls) Professor X and Magneto. And these aren't the spoilers. The only genuinely good thing about this movie is that Hrithik Roshan is really great as all the three characters - Rohit, Krishna and Krrish. The other thing I really had great time with whilst watching this nonsense was trying to figure the X-Men character they ripped off to create the character I am seeing on screen. Apart from these, nothing was there, except trashy things. The songs were useless in the first place, and to make this garbage more stinky, it greatly hampered the pacing of the movie.Score : 3.1/10Grade : E+Label : Epidemic" 
" Plagiarism..Plagiarism... Everywhere","Literally, each and every character, most of the action scenes, and dialogs in the film are inspired, or say blatantly copied from the Hollywood superhero films. X Men, Batman, Superman.. You name a comic hero, you got him in this film. Even the background score is lifted from Inception and The Dark Knight. And the worst part is that this plagiarism didn't pay off in the end. The screenplay was very poor. Action sequences looked too much fabricated, super slow, and lacked depth. It's a congery of B-grade visual effects, melodrama, and toothless humor.Final word: If you're are an eleven year old with no Hollywood experience, it's a treat for you. Or else, don't bother watching it." 
" Wish I were 12 again","The name "Krish 3" says you what you're in for when you pay for a ticket to this gigantic most 'ambitious' Indian superhero mega-budget project. It's neither The Superman nor Spiderman; it's a swindle of films such as X-Men, Babylon A.D. Spider-man, The Avengers and The Incredibles and Megamind. Directed and overseen by producer-filmmaker Rakesh Roshan, the movie failed to delivers on the promise of its name which contains some utterly ridiculous and pointless scenes. This is the third film as franchise in filmmaker Rakesh Roshan's ambitiously-scaled, action-packed and starring (wonder, wonder!) Hritik Roshan. As usual, this based on the strength of Hrithik Roshan—his energy, dynamism and a visible sincerity to save the human race against a powerful militia controlled by a wheelchair-bound (copy from "Babylon A.D.") mastermind Vivek Oberoi. The form-shifting Kangana Ranaut's character in the film is called Kaya, in fact she is the lead actress, is far sharper and more impactful. Needless to say Priyanka Chopra, Hritik's lady love, is lumbered with a vaguely written role in this film. The first thing to notice about the "Krish 3" soundtrack is that it is lengthy. Background music was loud and Songs pop in with the least expectation with the situation and it becomes highly awkward for the viewer. I will say the best bit in "Krish 3" is the Good effort on special effects - though clearly the concepts are borrowed from western movies and fails to impress. Nobody will say that the special effects were bad; I will say it was jaw dropping but what about everything else. It's another good example followed by "Ra-One", "Love story 2050" that just pouring in money and showing special effects doesn't help a film become good. This movie fails to create suspense on emerge victorious because the result is predictable and pointless but positive thing, its not that boring. Extremely, this film is for the die-hard fan of Hritik who hardly gives ANY importance to story OR screenplay. Roshan's family has thrown in all thinking of targeting all audience segments, and has therefore been unable to please maximum, at-least me. But For teenagers, it is definitely a delight. Once you accept it will be easier for you digest." 
" Amazing Special Effects for a Bollywood Movie...!!!","The vfx and special effects are one the Plus Points for the film.Quite an ambitious project and clearly they tried to put in everything in such a small budget. Appreciated !The songs are not gud but tolerable in the flow of the movie. The story is some what predictable.The characters mainly the bad guys are inspired from the X-men.I was skeptical before watching this movie because after watching so many near-to-perfect Hollywood superhero movies I wasn't sure if I would like this one. But I must say it didn't disappoint.All in all a good movie, not worth missing. If u keep your expectations a little low you'll love the movie.Final Words Rakesh Roshan is an expert director, no second thoughts about that but there are certain elements in the movie which he could have done without for better. Certain duologue's are over the top and cheesy, music is uninspiring, screenplay is weak and unimaginative. It resembles to a lot of Hollywood franchises which makes it hackneyed and makes us less proud of the finished product. The movie is not a great cinematic experience but isn't boring and crappy also. Good Acting (Vivek, Hrithik,Kangna) ,great VFX and an almost good story makes the ride enjoyable but bumpy due to certain roadblocks and speed breakers. If we compare it with the other superhero movies that Bollywood has churned out, Krrish 3 will top the list in terms of quality, acting and direction." 
" Pathetic!","OK! From where do I begin....Krrish 3 was a torture! he songs were desperate attempts to create music out of the themes of its prequel. The story line was completely predictable! I mean; Who would've expected a mutant to destroy the mutant race!Acting was good but was never backed with a good script.Some of the scenes seemed to be completely bogus! Perhaps; this looked more like an Indian version of the X-Men series! Vivek Oberoi tried being Magneto but he was a complete disaster!The only plus point I found was the technique that was used in making the movie. Apart from that; everything fell way beyond expectations." 
" Far below expectations","Krissh 3 is a mere example of desperation of Rakesh Roshan trying to make the sequel of Krrish but couldn't come up with a convincing script. So he did what we as students(most of us i believe)have done all our lives while preparing project reports.. download 4 or 5 projects and mix the content and thus prepare a new one. Same is the case with the movie. This movie is an amalgamation of 7 different movies or may be even more : Superman, Spiderman, Batman, Resident Evil, Matrix, Ultraviolet and x-men. I think it was a funny movie with all the "vahiyaat" hilarious songs. But the visual effects were really good." 
" krrish 3 awful","When i came to the movie i have lots of expectations but all gone wrong Acting - hrithic rockspriyanka not so goodRest of them are good not so goodDirection- Good Grapics - are good to compared with any other Indian move Sets - very bad, its like a comic movie set.Story - Man of steel stunts + X men story + mega mind + 7am arivu(Tamil)+some Indian mas ala+awful songs = krrish 3 Overoll its not good movie but u can watch it for hrithic roshan only.Why our Indian directors is copying very thing from Hollywood movies? Try to make some good movies with your own Imaginations. Krrish 3 is a main example of copyied movie." 
" I want to appreciate the efforts but I can't, sadly the movie is flawed in every area.","As an Indian, I am a big admirer of all these projects like Krrish, Ra- one etc. so I watched this movie without waiting for reviews, I kept low expectations and yet its utterly disappointing. I understand that such projects require a big budget, but the movie has so many flaws that this 'budget' excuse does not justify it anymore. At least one area where Bollywood is good at, 'Music', could be original, but no! From the initial credits where they play the spider-man theme music till the end music 'book of Eli' theme, the whole movie has bits & pieces of some Hollywood movie. Another confusing fact about this superhero Krrish is that his powers are not defined. Every Hollywood superhero is known for his well defined power, they have strengths & weaknesses. But nobody knows what Krrish is capable of, in some occasions he can't outrun a slow moving car and at some other times he is faster than light; sometimes he has to put all his power to move a truck and sometimes he would move mountains (a metaphor not literally); the superhero in Krrish(2006) who had powers like captain America, has turned into a superman in Krrish-3, now what's next? total BS. Please, define this superhero's powers properly. And please Mr. Rakesh Roshan, don't make our superhero cry like a toddler all the time. Talking about Kaal, I kinda like the villain in this movie and Vivek Oberoy deserves an applause for his acting and dialogue delivery. Whenever the dialogues were lame, well its not Vivek's fault. Mr Rakesh Roshan had so many powerful mutants in this movie, he could have used each one to give at least one small round of fight, but most of them were just wasted. Once again, zero innovation and zero originality cannot be justified by the low budget excuse. I did not put reviews earlier because I want this movie to make money and I want Mr. Roshan to make Krrish-4. And i'll watch Krrish-4, again without waiting for reviews, but if I see the movie & music is again borrowed by Hollywood, I will immediately put my reviews highlighting all the cons to make sure our people know what they are going to see, once Mr. Roshan work on these areas, the movie will appeal to another big segment of viewers who watch Hollywood movies regularly. Just show some originality and make your movie attract the intellectual viewers." 
" A forgettable dumb movie","Movie is full of stupid ideas just to make another sequel and connect with early parts.1. How is Vivek oberoi born / made/ The idea is crazy and just tries to connect to part2. 2. He says at the end that he cant be killed because he is not born,but he still wants bone marrow. 3. Kangana seems to be able to be clone any human including voice and actions. It is so funny. 4. The other Manimals are also funny. One guy eats ice cream just to get noticed to Hero and trigger fight. 5. Senior Hrithik invents something only for the sake of climax scene.The List is on..." 
" When will Bollywood get Original?","4 on 10 originally but for the efforts 5 on 10Plus Points Quite an ambitious project and clearly they tried to put in everything in such a small budget. Commendable !Criticism What are the superpowers of Krrish? Answer - anything that fits for the crowd. He can now fly as well.What are the superpowers of Kaal ahem or was it Charles Magneto? (a mix of professor xavier and magneto) oh he even have kaya who represents mystique.Quite an original concept! ahem or was it totally inspired from x men?Pathetic dialogues. The best one was a kid saying "kyun kaal ab fat gayi?" WTF !Overdose of emotions and forced insertion of dialogues that aimed at intriguing ur emotions but falls flat.Totally unoriginal as a movie.Kaal looked pathetic in his suit.The heart transformation was typical (kaya)Overtly clichéd story that you would have guessed after watching trailers itself.The most frustrating point was that there is no proper character development for any of the villains.Priyanka is used only as a reproducing unit who emerges whenever she is needed to turn the events in the favor of villains.The climax could not have gone worse than that. What were they hoping a sequel? Please a big NO.The songs. Made me sleepI never talked about vfx till now coz the budget was so so low that no one could have done any kind of wonders. But clearly I have seen better visual effects in Ra. One and Robot. Almost every scene looked fake.After reading the reviews I was finally hoping to see some good script or dialogues or anything coz I knew the effects will be quite average as I had assumed in the trailers but it did not even stood up on any other aspect. A typical Bollywood movie in the curtains of being called a superhero movie. Please make something original Bollywood." 
" Waste of Time, Money and Energy","This is by far the worst film I've ever seen. The Other 2 Films that preceded this we're both fairly good. They had a decent story line and the plot's weren't as predictable. Far too many concepts have been directly taken from the The Amazing Spiderman and the X-Men Movies for ex. "The Toad", "Mystique" and "Magneto" also the cure dispenser used around the climax was brilliantly ripped off from The Amazing Spiderman's ending scene.Expected more considering this was made IN 2013! PLOT WISE AND IN TERMS OF SPECIAL EFFECTS!(Which not to mention look like they we're made in a somewhat gifted geek's mothers' basement).In short I think the Indian Film Industry deserves better. You can't short sell the quality of a Movie because you know the hype and population will pay for your film's budget a few times over." 
" very sad","rating 1 as 0 is not available. only good part is of a grown man jiggling his jaw. the father son duo thinks that Indians don't know anything about Hollywood. granted they copied the first movie of the trilogy off ET, but still... copying x men is just pathetic... and the reverse star wars theory was predictable too... and the most unique power of any superhero... tap dancing with converse. no real ideas for the story... a super villain who steals ice cream from kids? really??? no real ideas for songs... using a lyric related to Gandhi and the independence of India is disrespectful. stop treating the Indian public as infants..." 
" This is a terrible movie","This movie could more aptly have been named Khichdi 3 than Krrish 3.We were just starting to believe that Mumbai is making movies with originality and the trend of copying from Hollywood is over, but not in this case.Widely touted as India's first super hero movie, this one takes MI-2, Spiderman, Matrix, X-Men and a bunch of other Hollywood movies and makes a complete mess of the mixture. It's a real pity that the talent of Hrithik Roshan is not just wasted, but completely destroyed in this movie. It is one of the few movies that I could not watch in it's entirety and the lowest rating I have given any movie this year.Do not watch it, if you have anything else to do." 
" Good Plot,decent special effects","Just watched the movie. I think this movie is the first step of bollywood in making superhero movies. Hrithik roshan was fabulous in three different roles. He was childish as rohit,sweet&cute as krishna and menacing as krrish. I was moved when rohit died. Because rohit mehra was one of my favorite character which was portrayed by hrithik. Finally, it is good family entertainer. But it lacks somewhere to attract the youth. Kangana Ranaut was superb as Kaya. Vivek oberio was also good as Kaal. It could have been a better movie. Another drawback is that it has inspired by x-men,superman. Which questions the originality of the characters in the movie." 
" A poor man's X-Men !","Perhaps the entire India was waiting for this movie, this sequel to the blockbuster 'KRRISH'. Really kudos to 'Rakesh Roshan' the way he remoulded the masterpiece(E.T) which is even considered as the best by 'Spielberg' to an 'Bollywood' film. With beautiful songs and a character , which later became as a household name(JAADU). He continued with his winning spree with 'KRRISH' but it seemed little out-of-the-track rather than a out-of-the-box-idea. The movie never settled on one plot, it kept moving in a zig-zag way and finally reached nowhere. But it was crystal clear that the director's sole motive was to make a hero out of the extraordinary 'Krishna' and so did it happen. Children loved it. So,its obvious that the expectations are sky- high as a huge chunk of money is riding on this superhero flick , let's see if it can sail through the troubled-waters of box-office as well as the viewers verdict.From the trailers it was clear that this movie is going to be an out and out sci-fi ,action flick with gorgeous VFX works and it stands on its claims. 'Shahrukh Khan's 'Red Chillies' is handling the VFX department and apparently has charged a hefty sum of $4.3 million. Just like painting needs a good idea first and then the combination of colours , this movie is lacking the former. Yeah . the movie seems a plagiarized version of the 'X-Men' series with elements from 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Relax, I'm not going to throw up on you! Lets talk about the story .From the trailers and promos you have the silhouette of everything . There are 5 mutants and a supervillian called 'KAAL'. Played by 'Vivek Oberoi' 'KAAL' seems a 'CHARLES XAVIER' but with negativity inside him. You can say that he plays 'MAGNETO' but afflicted with the physical disabilities like that of 'CHARLES XAVIER'! As Rakeshji claimed that 'KAAL' is like a strong character with a very high level of dexterity for all types of skulduggery , his tall claims fall flat . We don't see much of a crooked mind who can claim the title 'SUPER' of course he is a villain and so was 'RA.One' in 'RA.One' if you remember. So this so- called super-evil character sits on a chair like 'Charles Xavier' does and keeps rolling the dice to play his dirty tricks. So mutants , yeah you heard it right ! These mutants coerce me to remind me of the 'X-Men' movies, sorry its inevitable, can't help it . Friends , I'm not spoiling anything but you have already seen that this movie deals with fighting against a virus so the plot itself draws its roots from 'World War Z'. Remember the risks 'Brad Pitt' takes to save humanity . So does the tragedy and action begins. 'Kangana Ranaut' who is assigned the role of 'KAYA' is perhaps one of the dumbest and lamest character I've ever seen in movies. She reminded me of 'Shahrukh Khan' in 'RA.One'. She desperately seeks attention with her scantily clad body ,She keeps alluding herself as 'The Catwoman' in 'Christopher Nolan's epic movie 'The Dark Knight Rises'. She barely wants to stay in her outfit. She just spread herself too thin to please the audience in the song 'Dil Tu hi Bata'. She first had declined the offer to play this role but she finally took it. Sorry for us ! The music of this movie is tad boring and like a final blow are the songs. They keep killing you like virus and when they are over the amazing VFX and the sexy-superhero 'KRRISH' is there to save you from boredom. The song 'GOD ALLAH AUR BHAWAN' is the worst of this album and adding to its woe is the statue of 'KRRISH' which is actually a straight copy-paste done by the director from 'NOLAN's flick of 'BATMAN'. Whenever 'Hrithik' says 'Everyone has KRRISH inside them' you can't resist the temptation and the dialogues of 'Bruce Wayne' from the 'BATMAN' series of 'NOLAN' keep bombarding to your senses. The dialogues of 'KRRISH 3' are really pathetic with plethora of mediocrity all around. The VFX really is amazing, that is spectacular! Sometimes it might seem a bit dull but you have never seen special effects at this altar in BOLLYWOOD ever. A great success for 'Red Chillies' . 'Rakesh Roshan' makes sure you are entertained throughout because of the special effects. The entry scene of Krrish saving a plane from crash landing is well done and that sets the ball rolling. Needless to say one of the great assets of the film is 'Hrithik Roshan' who portrays three roles in this film (Rohit, Krrish, Krishna). In fact, in the action scenes, you just know that there could be no other mainstream star in Bollywood who could do it the way he pulls it off. His newly toned body can give any Hollywood actor a run for their money.But special effects don't alone work . 'KRRISH-3' has a predictable storyline and absolutely no screenplay In most of his interviews, Rakesh Roshan insisted that Krrish 3 is not just an action film and now I know what he meant, in fact it can be said that it is a 'Wannabe MASALA SUPERHERO MOVIE' ! FINAL WORD-Fans may say inspiration, others may say genuine ,critics may say plagiarism but at the end audience(as general) asks for entertainment the answer is yes. Give 'KRRISH' a chance ! It deserves ." 
" Krrish Crashhhhh...","Our Indian Superhero, while saved people and defeated villains, failed to save the movie.There is no doubt,Krrish is a tailor-made role for Hritik Roshan, he embodies the character perfectly,his performance, physically and emotionally, is very good.Unfortunately,only performances are the best thing about this movie.Performances - Hritik is Outstanding,As Rohit Mehra he even outshines Krrish. Kangna impresses again and is perfect for the role, while Priyanka delivers well. They could have done something interesting with Priyanka's character to make a difference.Promos were generous enough to give a glimpse of Vivek Oberai as Kaal, and i was somewhat impressed but the character is dull and boring.Script and dialouge- No originality.It's formulaic.Characters lack growth.Villains were more like Indian cousins of Hollywood's X-men. Nothing seems new. Hindi movies are incomplete without OTT melodrama and cheesy lines.But c'mon not in Superhero flick....unfortunately, it happens....the first half is laughable ( or you can cringe if you want to )...Second half is serviceable enough.Songs ---- take an advice, do keep some nice collections of songs in your ipod and play them during any of the movie's song.You can put on the loudspeakers if you like.No one will complain b'cause the movie has the MOST AWFUL SONGS. Krrish songs kinda grew on me later but here the songs are repulsive....Effects - Commendable by Indian standards and its budget but it fails to reach a level where moviebuff, who has watched a lot of Superhero flicks, can appreciate it.To RAKESH UNCLE, DON'T WORRY , YOU HAVE ENTERED THE 200 crore club."
