" Bollywood "heroes" can learn from the heroines","Nowadays when the so-called superstars of bollywood (Salman, Akshay, SRK etc) make such mindless & nonsensical movies in the name of leave-your- brains-at-home comedies (like Kick & Ready & Dabang & Entertainment & what not), Mardaani is a refreshing change. I am not saying that it's a gem or the best movie out there but it is good. It has a good (although not many twists or turns) story, powerful acting by Rani and the supporting cast, no out-of-context songs and very nice ending.I see a trend that Bollywood heroines are trying to come up with good movies like Kangana in Queen, Revolver Rani; Priyanka in Mary Kom, Fashion; Vidya in Kahani, No one killed Jessica etc where as the 40+ year old "heroes" are still stuck in the 90s; churning out stupid movies where the girl is mainly for songs. I don't have a problem with those kind of movies too if they are decent; which many aren't. I love a good comedy or action movie as much as I enjoy a serious one. But the movies made by the male "superstars" are not even funny or entertaining; though surprisingly, those movies are in the 200 crore etc club.I hope we as an audience start to appreciate some diversity that movies like Mardaani portray." 
" A rare realistic movie in Indian commercial cinema","Mardaani is a brilliant movie, and especially so because it comes in a time so crowded by the larger-than-life police cop, who is way beyond falling into physics of regular procedurals. The casting is picture perfect, and the dialogs, not crispy, but suited well. I appreciate the fact that they didn't push in any songs (except for one song in the end in the background, but that is acceptable), and the movie respects intellect and reality (lending it an 'adult' rating). The whole negative cast of the film is so well cast, (partly because its from a real life story), that I couldn't take my eyes off. Its a recommended movie, (and definitely a better watch than the Expendibles.) and I am happy that people have sensibilities in them to make meaningful cinema." 
" A Powerful Film","Mardaani is a movie that despite an unimaginative plot and predictable narrative engrosses you in its fabric. Rani Mukerji is pitch perfect in the role of a super-cop that is rightly hued, far from the floss and swagger of Chulbul Pandey and Singham. She is real, gritty and every bit brilliant. Though the film's climax loses itself in melodrama, this is a film that has its heart in the right place and tells a pertinent story at a time when it must be heard.Rani Mukerji with no make up, stern face maintains her strong demeanor. The actress is non dramatic on purpose and that did the trick for me. She is far from the pomp and show of masala cop films and that subtlety blows your mind. I am ecstatic that the lady has returned in a role that does justice to her caliber.Tahir Bhasin is a revelation and quite interestingly lives up to Rani's stature. The chase between him and Rani is built brilliantly mostly because of his conviction in rendering such brilliance to his character. His diction and twang both blend in well drawing one's attention even further." 
" Mardaani Review","With a sudden spate of cop-oriented films in Bollywood, the larger- than-life heroism has occupied our mind space ominously. We saw the maverick soldier Akshay Kumar combating the sleeper cells in Holiday and the tough cop Ajay Devgan decimating the corrupt politicians in Singham Returns. Having said that, the Pradeep Sarkar-directed Yash raj films' latest outing "Mardaani" is a departure from the archetypal escapist commercialism. The protagonist here is a lady - Shivani Shivaji Roy(Rani Mukherjee), a no-nonsense crime branch police officer wages a relentless fight to bust a human trafficking racket in Mumbai.Giving one of the most low-key and unassuming introduction to the lady hero where her team tracks down a small-time criminal , the plot ticks off when a 12-year old street girl,almost like her family member, goes missing from an orphanage which in turn insinuates the operating of a deadly sex racket. Shivani pursues this case strongly as she senses a strong nexus behind this crime scene of terrifying magnitude until she comes in telephonic contact with the mastermind. What ensues is a cat and mouse game to hunt down the criminal and things take an ugly turn when it is taken to the personal level.A taut thriller in all respects, Mardaani works because of the slick direction. The treatment stays faithful to the dark and grim subject. I admit that some scenes involving the facets of flesh trade appear voyeuristic due to which the film is certified with 'A' rating, but Sarkar redeems them with some engaging conversations between the cop and her nemesis. Equally entertaining is the banter between Shivani and her team and the liberal use of expletives which lends the film an authentic touch. The tussle here is interestingly cerebral for most parts , thanks to the clever writing (Gopi Guthram) until the climactic showdown which is quite formulaic.Sarkar treads on a different trajectory altogether. With 2 hours running time devoid of naach-gaana , it is quite unusual for a YRF flick. But what makes Mardani consistently watchable is the spirited performances of the entire star-cast. Surely, its crafted as a come-back vehicle for Rani, and the actress does complete justice in terms of depicting strength and emotional heft. She is quite in ease with the lingo, the uniform and the attitude. Tahir Bhasin impresses as the ruthless kingpin of the sex racket, adding a despicable menace to his character. He is not a regular Bollywood baddie, but a college dropout who is tech-savvy, addicted to video game and smart with Bluetooth. Rani's on screen husband played by Jissu Sengupta is almost side-tracked except in one gut- wrenching sequence where he miserably becomes a pawn in the rivalry of the cop and antagonist.I enjoyed each and every minute of Mardaani. It's not your regular run- off-the-mill stuff and more importantly pushes the envelope of serious cinema without making you feel bored." 
" Rani Mukherjee is mind blowing with her punches and fiery dialogues","It is heartening and encouraging to see women centric films doing well in Bollywood - Kahaani , English Vinglish, Queen and now Mardaani adding extra charm to the genre.Mardaani tells the true story of drug racket and child trafficking which is very much existing in current India. An orphan goes missing from NGO doubting Crime Branch officer Shivani Shivaji Roy and investigate the case which involves a cat-mouse game between Shivani and the mafia kingpin.From the director of Parineeta , Pradeep Sarkar is in a great form. After strings of flops , he comes back with a bang. Hats off to him for creating niche drama with well-written screenplay that will keep glued on to the screen till the end. Cinematography is outstanding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Editing adds crispiness to the pace. Mardaani belongs to queen of hearts - Rani Mukherjee. The supremely talented actress will prove the naysayers that she could come back and deliver a solid performance. She is mind blowing with her punches and fiery dialogues. Tahir Raj Bhasin will surprise you as mafia kingpin.Mardaani has everything going in its favor - Brilliant direction, Strong performances. Highly recommended. Excellent 4/5www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk" 
" A Crisp, Intense Crime-Drama!","'Mardaani' Directed by the talented Pradeep Sarkar, is A Crisp, Intense Crime-Drama, that is Well-Written, Superbly Directed & Brilliantly Acted. The film comes as a pleasant surprise & ranks among the better films of 2014, yet. 'Mardaani' Synopsis: A cop's search for a missing teenage girl leads her to the depraved world of child trafficking. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game between the fearless cop and a ruthless mafia kingpin.'Mardaani' has a power-packed first-hour, with each sequence leaving an impact. The cat-and-mouse game between the fearless cop & the ruthless mafia kingpin is grasping, although the second-hour slows down a bit. What makes 'Mardaani' work prominently, is its raw approach & the brisk pacing, which keeps its spectator glued to the screen. Gopi Puthran's Screenplay is fabulous. Its gritty, intense & fast. However, the climatic moments aren't too effective. Pradeep Sarkar's Direction is simply superb. He's in command this time around. Cinematography is top-class. Editing is balanced. Action-Sequences are raw. Performance-Wise: Rani Mukherji is in terrific form. She enacts the cop with rage & intensity. She leads the film with a yet another stellar performance! Tahir Bhasin is tremendous as the chief villain. He handles his part with utmost conviction. Anil George is absolutely brilliant in a small, yet frightening role. Jisshu Sengupta is sincere. Others lend admirable support. On the whole, 'Mardaani' packs a solid punch! Strongly Recommended!" 
" A genius attempt!!","The cover page may show how the country is honored and reputed with her inordinately enriched culture, but beneath the radiant covers lie some of the darkest stories listening to which one might flinch with disgust and pain. Pradeep Sarkar and his team made a masterful attempt to narrate one of them, Child trafficking.After Pradeep Sarkar's dual debacles(Laaga Chunari Mein Daag and Lafangey Parindey), with "Mardaani" he manages to strike the bull's-eye this time. With a crisp, fast-paced and to-the-point screenplay, the movie keeps you glued for the entire two hours. Though dramatic and filled with intense emotions, the sequences of the film are quite within the realistic domain(the climax however may seem another typical- Bollywood-hero-villain-clash). In terms of characterization, Shivani Shivaji Roy (Rani Mukherji) the daring protagonist is an elegant amalgamation of Mother India and Bajirao Singham. She breaks every barrier for the girl(who she thinks of her as her daughter), she fights everyone gallantly(but staying within the realms of human power)...Rani Mukherji totally justified the role. Karan Rastogi alias Walt (Tahir Raj Bhasin) also manages to tingle the nerves with his villainous performance. Pyari(Priyanka Sharma), the abducted street girl, also makes her presence felt with her obtrusive performance.I salute and applaud the team's effort to raise awareness of such a gruesome issue which preys over 40,000 innocent children of the country every year." 
" Mardaani: A Celebration of Woman Power","There are some movies which are made just to entertain but there are some which makes you think, Mardaani falls in the latter genre.Human Trafficking is a business which is growing at an alarming rate worldwide and India is a hub of Child Trafficking and Mardaani deals with this topical subject.Gopi Puthran chooses a controversial topic of Human Trafficking for his story and the risk with such subjects is that it becomes preachy. But thankfully Gopi's screenplay refrains from doing so and tells the story in a thriller format of a crime branch Inspector Shivani Shivaji Roy (Rani Mukherjee) who has a soft spot for an orphan Pyari (Debutant Priyanka Sharma). Life takes a turn for Shivani when Pyari goes missing, how Shivani busts the Human Trafficking nexus and finds Pyari constitutes the rest of the story.Gopi's screenplay captures the modus operandi of how human trafficking is done in a thriller format which is engaging and keeps you at the edge of the seat; not much time is spent on the emotional quotient. It is the climax which looks a bit too convenient. The characters are realistic and so are the dialogues. But I thought the Thriller quotient could have been much better as the surprise element is missing in most part of the movie.The performances are the biggest highlight of the movie. Rani as Shivani gives a crackling performance, everything from her body language to the way she speaks everything is spot on. Rani Mukherjee again proves that you cannot keep a good actor away for too long. Another brilliant performance is of the debutant Tahir Raj Bhasin who plays the antagonist Karan, he is so good that you start hating him, truly a brilliant debut. Tahir's portrayal of Karan is a perfect complement to Rani's portrayal of Shivani. Mona Ambegoankar gives a superb performance, though her role is small but she shines even in a brief role, sad to see that a brilliant actress like her is underutilized. Another debutant Priyanka Sharma as Pyari shows spark. Jishu Sengupta the Bengali actor is wasted in a brief role. Rest of the cast is cast well and they do a good job. I should mention Shanoo Sharma the casting director who has done a brilliant job of casting.The second highlight is the cinematography by Artur Zurawski who captures the bylanes of Mumbai and Delhi well and keeps the tone as realistic as possible in lieu of the narration.With "Mardaani" Pradeep Sarkar resumes his original form which was seen in "Parineeta" (2005). Though a dark and sensitive subject, but Pradeep handles it well and keeps the narrative simple though a bit of twists would have been better. But Pradeep is successful is extracting some brilliant performances from the cast which is commendable.Kudos to Pradeep Sarkar for taking up such a sensitive issue for a movie and showing how women can defend themselves against odds. This movie is a true celebration of woman power...." 
" Mardaani - Rani pulls it perfectly","Bollywood has always space to celebrate womanhood through their films. Mardaani is on that league. After watching the trailer recently I decided to watch this movie which deals the serious subject of sex trafficking in India. Based on some true events the story opens up with Rani as a brave lady officer who is bold and mannish. The dialogue was witty to portray a daring officer when she deals with a goon who messes with her. The way she asks them "anyone else wants to learn law" was fantastic. The story gets serious when Rani tangles herself into the case of a missing girl "Pyarri" who is known to her. Then she traces and reaches Walt the kingpin of the child sex trafficking and challenges him that she will save the girls within thirty days. The rest of the story travels with some raw reality about human trafficking and drug deals from Mumbai to Delhi to expose some hard truth about India. Whether Shivani Shivaji Roy was able to succeed her mission of saving the girls before they lose their innocence in prostitution is the rest of the plot featuring some investigations, chase etc., makes us stay engaged throughout the movie. As for as the performances the lead starting Rani Mukerji is promising as Shivani Shivaji Roy senior inspector of police crime branch Mumbai. May it be a blind girl in "Black" or an adulterous wife in "KANK" or a daring journalist in "No one killed Jessica" or the bubbly thief in "B&B" she has always justified her role. Yet again she proves again her versatility. Then comes Tahir Bhasin as Walt the antagonist succeeds in creating a feel of hatred towards him. Technically brilliant camera works and BGM helped the movie greatly. #Mardaani is a worth watch gripping tale but lags something to join the wagon of other woman hood films like "English Vinglish" "Kahaani" "Queen" "Fashion" "The Dirty Picture". Eagerly waiting to watch the next film on this league PC's avatar as "MaryKom". -Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran" 
" Proud to be a Rani fan","I have no words to express what I am going through. Rani time and again has tried really hard to sustain a movie on her shoulders. She wanted to make a mark. She wanted to show that you don't need a hero for a movie to be good. Finally she triumphs and how . My god what an attempt in showcasing the brutality of reality, the pain and the wrath of millions. Very few movies are applauded by audience and mardaani is one among them. People screaming and cheering for whats being shown clearly depicts how well they relate to the issue and how clearly the team has succeeded in their attempt. This film deserves to be watched by every single human being. There were many cops in Hindi cinema making cars and lorries fly but there will be only one Shivani who touches your heart. People stop making 100 crore masala movies which makes no mark and adds no value. Learn from this team to make meaningful cinema which leaves a mark for eons to come.A proud Rani fan." 
" Engaging Drama Conveys An Important Message. ♦ 74%","Mardaani is a good film released at the right moment.I say that because of the high proportion of news about rape and sexual assault and attacks on women in the national newspapers in India. Pradeep Sarkar succeeds in retelling the acclaimed Hollywood story (Liam Neeson's Taken) of how an officer single-handedly taken on the traders of flesh. He charms the audience by filling all holes that would've crept up had it been a poorly researched film, like all other recent Bollywood films are.Here in, we have inspector Shivani (Rani Mukherji) who uses her manliness to search and kill the young boy, a flesh trade kingpin who kidnapped and sold her adopted child into overseas sex rackets. There are chiefly two villains in the film, both of which are good. But I am awestruck by nobody Tahir Bhasin's brilliant performance as the vindictive boss who speaks like he was a born criminal. His air, his diction, his portrayal - all upped my ante in cinema-watching experience. Come climax, this same villain goes through a paradigm shift and seems to have lost all his qualities, which drives the predictability ahead.But I am not complaining because the 2 hours were never boring. Plus, since it conveys a message that women should stand up with a touch of power for their rights hits the right chord with the large number of women that were present in the theater hall.Coming to the cuss language, I didn't mind it because it was a necessary component. Mukherji is good, as well. The supporting cast is fine. The title track is surely to hit the charts.BOTTOM LINE: One of the very few watchable films in 2014 Bollywood, Mardaani is an unexpected treat. If you have 2 hours to spare this weekend, go watch it and come home entertained.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES (You should!)" 
" Not ur regular Bollywood trash, tight script, crispy editing n lots of tension n suspense.","I first saw this in a theatre with my dad n son. Revisited it recently on a dvd.
It is a solid crime thriller. Rani Mukherjee pulled of the job of a cop very well.
The fight sequences r top notch n thank God ther ain't any songs in this film.
People may find similarities with Trade (2007) n Taken (2008)." 
" Serious movie without putting unnecessary songs!","The problem with serious movies in India is that people don't like to watch these movies in theaters. Most of the people, i am not saying all want some peppy movie with sizzling songs and item numbers which can spice them up or some silly comedy which i they think makes them tingle and expect us to laugh, well that ain't happening.Starting of, i personally thought that movie career for women are only up to a few years from now and a very old concept is that after marriage heroines just loose their roles but this ain't true.Rani Mukerji is back and altogether for a bang! This movies is kick-ass. You don't have to worry about censoring dirty abusive language or scenes because this is reality and criminals just don't say all their biography by just a slap.Our heroes could learn this from Rani... A must watch which is very rare for Bollywood Films..." 
" Fabulous!","10 pointers for a 10 on 10 review - 1. By far the best Bollywood movie of the year 2014. 2. Power packed performances by Rani Mukherjee and Tahir Bhasin. 3. A No-Nonsense movie - Must Watch. 4. With a strong message sent back to the society! 5. Small details and every minute aspect kept intact! 6. Super-cop performance with minimal resources at disposal. 7. No songs in between serious scenes - No breakaway from context. 8. Decent performance by support cast. 9. Common Man scenes for larger mass. 10. Typically unBollywoodish - will keep you glued to your seat for the entire length of the movie - ends with a cracker from Sunidhi!" 
" An eye opener- a message conveyed brilliantly.","The current circumstances of India on a flip side are inhuman inclinations, rapes, murders, kidnappings, human trafficking and so on. We are suddenly surrounded by these rapists and captors. "Mardaani" gives us an eye opener, teaches us about the morality and humanity. This is a great effort by the Director Pradeep Sarkar and the Writer Gopi Puthran.Shivani Shivaji Roy (Rani Mukerji) is a senior crime branch officer in Mumbai, her daughter like Pyari (Priyanka Sharma) gets kidnapped by a trafficking faction, led by Walt (Tahir Bhasin). She gets engulfed in the dirty web and pledges to destroy the entire racket.The narrative is perfectly paced; there are no-nonsense song sequences or clichéd melodramatic scenes. Pradeep Sarkar has chosen a definitive panache of depicting the prostitution which is never titillating but uncomfortable. It has a well-researched script with seamlessly weaved scenes. It never becomes overdramatic or pretentious. Certain scenes, a woman barged into the rickshaw as police are prepared for the raid or the scene when minister ready to rape Shivani etc. are stand-out. However, the background score sometimes is melodramatic and slows the stride of scenes.Tahir Bhasin, in his debut, did an impeccable job, as a next-door boy. His screen presence, dialog delivery, body language, and mannerisms are terrific. He is just outstanding as a hideous antagonist who gets annoyed over a girl's impatience demeanor and asks her to take a bite from his plate if she is that exasperated.Rani Mukerji delivers a flawless performance with masculine and feminine sides at the same time. The supporting across did a fantastic job in their important roles.Moreover, Mardaani generates awareness about child trafficking for sexual misconducts. It conveys a message that we are now on the edge of this viciousness and it needs to be stopped.Mardaani is a must watch. 7.5/10" 
" Khoob Ladi MARDAANI","After almost 2 years,Rani Mukherjee dazzles the silver screen with her impactful and fearless rendition of CBI officer Shivani (Shivaji) Roy.She is an institution and inspiration for many newbies who do nothing more than painting their faces and running around trees. Director Pradeep Sarkar not only extracts a power-packed performance from all the actors, but also minutely explores the in-depth layers of child trafficking. The movie has enough chills and thrills to keep you glued to your seats. Hats off to Yashraj for presenting cinema in its purest form without sensationalizing or speaking over-the-top. It is one of the best movies of this year, though viewer's discretion is recommended (due to Adult Content), people who like sensible cinema shouldn't miss it."
