" Has its few moments but is also based on a very thin and unconvincing plot.","Small budget, experimental movies are more than welcome in the present scenario when the film business is largely ruled by the stars coming up with all routine projects. So from that angle KUKU MATHUR KI JHAND HO GAYI can easily be rated as a fairly decent debut attempt by the director Aman Sachdeva to recreate the look, feel & magic of films such as KHOSLA KA GHOSLA, DELHI BELLI, VICKY DONOR and FUKREY (all revolving around a similar backdrop).So following the same Hit pattern, Aman Sachdeva also makes his light hearted movie moving around Delhi only with mostly Punjabi & Haryanvi characters interacting with each other. Talking about two fast friends, stepping into their real life after passing the 12th exams, it showcases how one of them (Kuku) takes a wrong decision on a third person's advice and then later repents on the same, returning to his dear friend. Made on a familiar 'seen before' kind of base (with a unusual catchy title), the film does have its few moments and some good performances too coming from the fresh cast. But the problem actually lies in its too thin plot which remains unconvincing throughout as such drastic, senseless and criminal step is not insanely taken by a friend against the other for just a small revenge. Moreover a lot of time gets wasted in the beginning (almost 35-40 minutes), wherein the film has nothing to convey as per its storyline and it keeps showcasing their friendship only through various sequences. Further the criminal activities are performed with such an ease or confidence, without any moral fear or hesitation that it all seems to be too filmy to believe in.With a mediocre soundtrack, non-contributing background music and an average cinematography, KMKJHG actually just falls short of being as realistic as any of the Delhi based films mentioned above. Selecting an unusual title inspired from the local lingo, the accent sounds to be artificial most of the times and the next to door family kind of feeling is largely missing. Also the film keeps following its inspirational sources devotedly, which is clearly visible in sequences such as the Jagaran one, straight away reminding you of FUKREY.In the performance section, both Siddharth Gupta (Kuku) & Ashish Juneja (Rony) show their confident sparks in few good scenes and Simran Kaur Mundi is just OK with nothing much to do along. Pallavi Batra (as the actress) impresses, but also tries to be a loud clone of Parineeti Chopra. Siddharth Malhotra (Rony's elder brother),Brijendra Kala (as Baba Ji), Somesh Agarwal (Kuku's father), Anoop Puri (Rony's Grandfather) and Rajesh Sharma (Jagran Singer) add their own individual bit to this simple, social comedy. But its the enjoyable acts of Amit Sial (as Mama Ji), Alok Chaturvedi (as the Watchman), and the actress playing the watchman's villager wife, which actually make the film interesting enough despite having a quite non-existing plot line.In short, KUKU MATHUR KI JHAND HO GAYI is a light hearted comic film trying to impress that particular section of viewers who loved watching similar, recent entertainers like FUKREY. But scoring a lot less in comparison, it also strictly remains the one which you might enjoy more watching on a TV channel without making an effort or spending a good amount of money on its costly multiplex tickets." 
" Kuku Mathur ki Jhand Ho Gayi is an average entertainer, although it does convey that there are no shortcuts to success.","Please read this review at http://moviereviewsbybinduc.blogspot.inKuku Mathur ki Jhand Ho Gayi is a decent (means minus vulgarity) Comedy clubbed with a bit of Romance. Although this film has nothing much to offer in terms of its plot, yet the film will not give you headache, three male actors Siddharth Gupta, Amit Sial and Ashish Juneja do make this at least a watchable movie. Contrary to the official poster of this movie, it is not a sex comedy at all, rather it projects the plight of an youngster who is in the phase of choosing a suitable career, establishing himself, proving himself etc. The movie gives the message that we may have two road maps to success in our lives – one path may be easier, shorter but involves crooked means and the other path may be tougher, longer, full of challenges but a true / honest path. One must go for the latter option, otherwise, success would be short-lived, success achieved through easy means may prick your conscience one-day. This film, directed by Aman Sachdeva, is shot at Delhi. Jhand is a typical Dehlite word which means 'taken for a ride'. Kuku Mathur (Siddharth Gupta) and Ronnie Gulati (Ashish Juneja) are great friends since childhood. Kuku comes from an ordinary service class family. His father is a government officer, who wants his son to study hard and get a good job, whereas the Gulatis run the garment business.Kuku keeps on trying his culinary skills at home who aspires to have his own restaurant one day. Both Kuku and Ronnie go to an internet café to check their 12th class results. How Ronnie tries to persuade Yogesh (Internet Café owner) to check the results ahead of the queue by cashing on Kuku's status as a motherless child is an enjoyable scene. Both of them have managed to score very average in 12th apart from physical education. Kuku gets scolded by his father for his low score. Ronnie, gets a surprise gift – a shop- from his grandfather –Ronnie Matching Center. Kuku tries for a different path to seek admission in college, but not manages to get through and ends up working as a spot boy in a shady film set. Ronnie's getting busy with his business and not being able to turn up to spend time / have fruit bear together, creates a deep sense of hurt / frustration in Kuku's mind. Kuku starts feeling that his friend has changed. Ronnie snubs Kuku. A few incidents which followed thereafter create rift between Kuku and Ronnie.Then Kuku's cousin Prabhakar (Amit Sial) enters in the scene who has all sorts of short-cuts to achieve what he wants, devious solutions for every problem. Prabhakar steals the show with most of the lines. Prabhakar suggests weird ideas to Kuku for starting his restaurant. And Kuku, otherwise a well-mannered person, does get influenced with his Prabhakar Bhaiya. What do Kuku and Prabhakar do? How do they manage to get money to start Kuku's restaurant ? In what mess Kuku ends up? Is Kuku able to win his love Mitali (Simran Kaur), whom he silently loved since last 7 years, completely a one-way affair)? Does Kuku mend his ways anytime later, if yes, how? Romance in this movie falls flat. Certain scenes are comical: the warehouse guard's mobile romance with his wife, Mata ka Jagaran for the whole night with parody songs, the manner in which Prabhakar takes revenge with his ex-girlfriend for marrying someone else, A Godman giving advice etc"
