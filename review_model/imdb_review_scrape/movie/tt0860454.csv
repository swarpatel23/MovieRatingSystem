" One of the few Bollywood Films highly recommended by me......","Awww....... After having seen this movie I really wished that I'd go back to school & fall in love.... There was not a single instance in the movie which I did not like & honestly speaking the excessive songs and all is perhaps the only reason which prevents me from giving it a perfect 10. The entire setting with a group of four friends with their typical characters & their fun at school life was very refreshing and indeed very pleasant to watch.......The lead female- Hazel Croney was simple superb..... If I recall correct- there was this another teen movie which had released around the same time as this one- "Teree Sang" and there was a huge difference between the presentation of the two films though it had Ruslan Mumtaaz in common. Now, I wonder why this movie was not a success at the box office!!! It certainly deserves much more than what it's reception at the box office was. Typical things going through a teenage kids mind like- pornography, the urge to drive before being eligible for the driver's license, bunking school, playing pranks, rivalry amongst classmates was very good to see and it certainly gave the feeling to be back in school. Truly, A very underrated movie. And would like to say it once again.... "If love in school life can be so beautiful, I guess I've missed out on some wonderful moments that could be possible in a school boys' life!"" 
" Beautiful Creation by Robby","A teenager love-story full of emotions with lots of mischief and teenage vigor. Full marks to Robby for that. He has done justice to every character. Hazel (Ayesha) looks beautiful and Ruslaan(Rohan) has completely immersed himself in the colors of teenage. I think both have a good future. This movie should again bring back the Bollywood focus to Teenagers and their life. The Music is just like the icing on the cake. The songs like 'Who am I, Kaun hoon Main' and 'Title track' are pretty good songs. Full marks for the timing of the songs and situational lyrics also. The songs never seemed to be haulting the story rather they just enriched the color and texture of it.Little bit of drama but I guess that's excusable as it's a Hindi movie. The second half takes a dramatic turn and at that point one gets a feeling that Robby has lost the track. Considering it's his one of the starting attempts I'll not be very harsh on him. In short, a commendable effort by all. We hope to see more of Robby in future." 
" tOO gOOd","The film belongs to the romance genre and has been directed by Robby Grewal and stars debutants Ruslaan and Hazel. The film's script and screenplay have been done by Robby Grewal and Sameer Kohli. Rohan (Ruslaan) is a regular youthful energetic guy in high school. He is always up to pranks with his friends. One day he meets the new girl, Ayesha (Hazel) at his high school, but their first meeting is not a regular one. In fact it is a strange meeting where Rohan is bunking college and is detained by the school principal. In an attempt to avoid punishment, Rohan makes Ayesha a part of his alibi for not being in class. At the first meeting itself the two teenagers are drawn to each other and gradually they fall on love.This is the couple's first love and hence every little thing is a fresh and monumental occasion, like holding hands, smiling at each other, looking into the other's eyes etc. Every thing is going great with the young couple's love, unfortunately a simple misunderstanding leads to the couple splitting and going their separate ways. Ayesha is heartbroken and takes off for Paris. Meanwhile a despondent Rohan too misses Ayesha a lot and decides to follow his sweetheart to Paris. Rohan goes to Paris and tries to win Ayesha over once more. Will he succeed in getting his love back; will the couple get back together" 
" A wonderful, cute and lovely movie... Must watch","Love makes you do all the crazy things in world and the beauty of love is you never realize what you are messing up. It always seems like no body is having any clue about your smart moves to get closer to your love but reality is mostly the opposite. The movie MP3 is immersed into wonderful aroma of love in its every minute. From beginning to end it draws smile on your face and gives you the lovely feeling of love. The movie starts with 4 school going teenagers, having a strong bond of friendship and doing all the fun in their school times. Everyone is characterized so beautifully that one starts finding himself in those characters. The cute part of the movie starts after entry of Ayesha, the most pretty face in recent times. Then how seeds of attraction turns into full blown blossoming tree of love is really aesthetic. How the guy jealous about her other friends, how his friends show a strong bond of friendship in his lows, is really awesomely pictured. I loved the cinematography part of the movie and also the great mixing of music throughout the events of the movie. Its like the most watchable movie of all the times. Have a fultoosh relaxation and chill out with this must watch. Its a perfect romantic flick with entirely fresh art of direction. Kudos to Robby Grewal, the director of the movie for his masterpiece effort." 
" An Absolute Realistic First Love Story","Despite not being a fan of Hindi movies, this will go down as the best movie that I have ever watched. I would definitely rate this movie one notch above Titanic (yeah! You heard it right!!). This epic love story is full of suspense. What makes the movie extra special is that it is focused on the first love story. The actor and the actress were not known before this movie and that does help to make it look so real.I would definitely recommend anyone to watch this movie all day long.An epic quest to finding your first true love. This movie shows how true friendship are in your schooling days and would want you to go back to school again!!" 
" Best love story","Its the best love story ever in the entire world. Its mind blowing. Its amazing. Its awesome. No, its more than that, Its flawless, absolutely perfect. Its even beyond comprehension. Its beyond everything else. I truthfully mean it from my heart, mind and soul. No over exaggeration. Its the greatest. I really mean it. I never ever gave review to any movie ever in the internet. But this one was so good that i couldn't resist. I just signed up in IMDb only to rate and review it. My rating is infinite out of 10. Thats all. Thanks for reading. However i have to complete the minimum 10 lines of text to post this review therefore i am just writing these random things just to fill up the space. Alright, now i think its enough. But remember, Its a MUST WATCH movie." 
" You must be joking right?","Maybe if I was not younger than most of the cast members who are trying to pass themselves off as teenagers then I would not have had a problem with this film. I didn't buy the hype surrounding 'Jaane Tu ya Jaane Na' (a film of similar persuasion) and thankfully this one was not hyped up (at least not in the part of the world where I reside) so it is easier to just watch the film as a time-passer rather try to figure out why I'm not feeling what other people are feeling. High School Musical, it is clearly NOT.I'm guessing I just don't like films like this that try to to be like 'Grease' (which was acted by people who are older than the age they were claiming but so well written and well acted that it did not matter) and 'West Side Story' just to mention a few.All that aside, Ruslaan Mumtaz (Rohan) is very cute and sort of reminds me of Arjun Rampal. And Hazel Croney should be very grateful that with such a think foreign accent, she was still allowed to dub her own lines for the film. Katrina Kaif should be so lucky." 
" Love just happens..... and thats' what is shown","Wonderful Movie... isn't perfect, but is beautiful, Hazel (ayesha) is stunningly beautiful, anyone would fall in love with her, ruslaan(rohan) is a perfect teenager. The director has given even justice to all, the leading couple, their friends, parents... Rohans friends do a good job-some nice moments,even rohans father is good...Will be a great watch for all those who did fall in love during the college days.. everyone will remember their days... A gr8 Indian teenage love story .. the moments where ayesha and rohan fall in love are picturised awesome.. A clean and a sober movie, no much mess and no unwanted scenes.The later half is quite unpredictable, But the end will bring a smile.Music is nicely composed, the title track is lovely, in my favourites..Nice direction, few errors(go un-noticed)" 
" Not bad....","Well, didn't expect much from this film on teenagers which went quite unnoticed. But it's not bad; and pretty entertaining. The film doesn't have a very salable cast or a complex story. The story is very simple and much repeated in most of the movies like a boy meets a girl and both fall in love; and the boy pursues the destiny and everything ends well. The film is told straight forward without any filmy gimmicks and turns out as a funny, entertaining film ending in a positive note. Just don't expect much from this one, I bet you would enjoy your evening with this one.Rating: 1 star out of 4" 
" a nice high school movie","A nice high school movie.i knewed from the promos itself that it will be a decent movie.the film didn't boasted a big star cast but even than it was successful in showing what school life is all about.the lead pairs falls in love in school and then what happens is what the movie is about. the track "shortcut" was good. if u watch it with comparisions,then its similar to ISHQ VISHQ but not 100%. the acting was average and u can be satisfied with it.but there r some things which should have been shown.for example:the hero takes 40 thousand rupees from his dad's credit card and fly to Paris!!!they should have shown what does his dad do's after knowing it.and he keeps on forgiving his son!hmmm other than that i think its a good movie and everyone should watch it." 
" Nice but a bit cheesy","Although almost all the Indian movies have more or less the same plot, this one, however, is a bit different. They have tried to make it more realistic and have succeeded to a certain extent. But, (and that's with a capital B) I would most certainly not exclusively recommend it to others. Its OK if there's not any other interesting movies around, but to go watch it on an occasion would not be a good idea. The pace is slow, and really does pick up a bit towards the end, however, one has to be patient to sit through the typical silly comedy and the all "ROMANTIC" way the lead roles meet. There is one more thing I fail to understand; why do they show parents in movies who are hell bent on spoiling their kids. If I tried to steal from my parents or come up with an ingenious plan to go abroad, I'll surely end up in the hospital, and so would most of the rest of us. Let's be a bit more realistic here, shall we? To sum up, a nice but cheesy film."
