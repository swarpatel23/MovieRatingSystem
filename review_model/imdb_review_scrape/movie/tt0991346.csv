" A Story Of A Heartwarming Friendship Between A Ghost and A Child","Debutant director Vivek Sharma's 'Bhoothnath' is a delightful treat to watch. His execution shows that he's among the promising directors. The camera-work is very impressive. The special effects are superb (something one hardly witnesses in an Indian film). Not only do they look great, they are very effectively used. What makes 'Bhoothnath' better than other films of its genre is that it appeals to both adults and children especially because of the comedy. Viewers can easily connect to the characters as are very likable and very real. Anjali isn't just the stereotypical mother one has grown too familiar with in a children's film. She's a loving mother alright but one that hates to cook and one that's honest enough to the principal to tell him (in good humour) that her son is a 'nightmare'. Banku isn't your average filmy kid (and credit goes to the actor for that). He is the likable little brat one would recognize in themselves. And of course, there's 'Bhoothnath' who could have easily been a caricature but remains a well-defined character that is courageous, stubborn, vulnerable, caring and eventually friendly.The writing is mostly good. The inspiration by films like 'Bogus', 'Casper' and 'The Sixth Sense' may show but 'Bhoothnath' is very much its own film. The dialogues are great and the film moves at a steady pace. However, the Ashish Chaudhury-Nauheed Cyrusi track could have better been left out. Their below-average acting give the impression that 'Bhoothnath' is just another cheesy horror film. That may have been Sharma's intention in order to surprise the viewer but I don't think it's necessary. The demonic daughter-in-law is a caricature that feeds the stereotype of Americans being careless towards family. There are a few plot holes. how is it that Bhoothnath can touch Banku at times but during a key scene, Banku is about to fall down the stairs but Bhoothnath is unable to save him because his hand moves through Banku's. Also, the whole death ritual track looks a bit out of place but at the same time this scene brilliantly displays Banku's innocence. Banku thinks that ritual is to celebrate Bhoothnath's birthday and he happily participates. Moreover this scene is wonderfully executed. The close-ups shifting back and forth from Amitabh's sad face (as he knows he'll never see Banku again) to Aman's thrilled face (as he thinks Bhootnath will be promoted to 'star' angel). Though things get more emotional in the second half, Sharma manages to balance it well with the rest.I have to say that Amitabh Bachchan really blew me away as 'Bhoothnath'. I did not like him in any of his films post 1980something (with the exception of 'Baghban') but he totally owns Bhoothnath. There is one scene where he overacts but I suppose it's become his trademark to have at least one scene where he screams. Nonetheless, this flaw is very minor and can be overlooked given his otherwise consistent performance. His heartbreaking acting scene while he watches a happy Banku and his parents perform his 'last rites' reminded me of the exceptional actor he was in the 70s. Juhi Chawla is excellent as she brings charisma, devotion and liveliness to Anjali. Her Anjali is a laid-back woman but a caring mother. I don't understand why they people compared her to Aishwarya Rai's glycerin shedding performance in 'Umrao Jaan'. Whether she used glycerin or not in the crying scenes, she played her part very well and brought out Anjali's fear of losing her child and her sympathy for Bhoothnath. Last year there was 'Taare Zameen Par's Darsheel Safari and this year it is newcomer Aman Siddiqui who surprises the audience with a superb performance. Siddiqui simply acts like a child in a very natural way. He isn't one of those kids who overly tries to be cute, begging for the audience to go 'awww'. He too owns his part. Shahrukh Khan has a strong presence in a small role. He and Juhi have always been magic together on screen and it was great to see them play parents. Satish Shah and Rajpal Yadav are respectively hilarious as the 'bullying' principal and thief. All these actors share a good chemistry. While it's good to see Priyanshu Chatterjee after his absence from films, he is simply okay here.Among the songs, I really liked the 'Aandhi' track, filmed on the children in their different get-ups. But, it was weird to see the little girls dressed as prostitutes. 'Chale Jaane Do' is a sweet track sung by Amitabh and Juhi. I didn't like the hip hop track 'Mere Buddy' so much.In a nutshell, 'Bhoothnath' is one of the better films of the genre. Forget all those pretentious crap 'Krishh' and 'Koi Mil Gaya'. 'Bhoothnath' too may be a larger than life film but one that connects to both adults and children. In spite of a 2hour 15 minutes length, it didn't feel like a waste. Why should it if you're having fun?" 
" A Quality Movie!","The movie is about a man who becomes Ghost(Bhooth) after his death. This Ghost is so attached to his house that he doesn't let anyone live in it. One day, comes a little boy with his mother and father to live in the house. While the father is a sailor who goes away on his duty, the mother and the boy live in the house. One night this Ghost tries to haunt the kid(Banku), but Banku doesn't fear him, rather thinks of the ghost as an Angel. Banku and Ghost become friends, and their adventures are recorded in the further story. The movie generally received good reviews, and was a hit at the Box-Office, yet I feel that it was not given applauds it deserved.The story is well executed, and pace of the movie is even. Acting wise, Amitabh Bachchan comes again with a spot on performance, I didn't know that a Ghost character can be played so naturally. The small boy, does his part high great confidence and comes up with great performance. Other cast have less time in the movie, but they do their parts neatly. No songs, a plus point. Direction is good. Background score is good.Go for this movie, this won't disappoint you." 
" Funny adventures of a Diissatisfied Spirit and a Notorious kid !!!","BHOOTNATH is a comedy genre movie which has a tragedy as its base. It shows the unfortunate condition of our modern society where children don't want to take the responsibility of their parents in old age similar to Kailash Nath whose son Vijay after studying in America settled there with his wife and avoided his parents. The limit of selfishness crossed when his mother passed away and he came back to India to earn profit by selling his home NATH VILLA. His father didn't allowed so as the memory of his wife Nirmala is attached to this home. This irritates his son and he decided to left him alone there.Here happens the TRAGEDIC EVENT ,when Kilash run behind Vijay to stop him ,he slipped from stairs and died but his son didn't listened to his last words. Till then his dissatisfied spirit roaming in the home decided that he will never let anyone reside there.THE TURNING POINT came when there comes a family of BANKU his kitchen-shy mom and slap-happy dad to live in the house. The ghost has the plan of scaring the family away. But he runs into the notorious 7 year old Banku who mistakes the ghost as an angel (named him Bhoothnath) and befriends him. Thereby begin the funny antics of Banku and Bhoothnath. With a mere flick of his finger, Bhoothnath is able to do magical feats, and more so willingly at Banku's command.The film focuses on the FUNNY ADVENTURES OF THE KID AND THE GHOST until Bhoothnath's past catches up with him.BHOOTNATH focuses on the POWER OF LOVE & FORGIVENESS which Kailash regains with the friendship of Banku. Kailah forgave his son but got bounded with the love of Banku ,so he didn't get MOKSHA(or SALVATION) & he returned back to him secretly and the movie is "TO BE CONTINUED" waiting for his next part including me and other fans of Big B.I gave movie 10/10 because it has everything -a lot of FUN ,MORAL ,MAGIC ,FICTION as well as EXCELLENT ACTING by all the characters .It should be seen by all the age-groups.WOW you should surely buy a DVD of this great movie !!!" 
" A Good Comedy With Family Drama","I was totally surprised by this movie even though I had watched some of the promos. In a way, this is not a typical BR Chopra film and yet in a way it is - a simple film portraying a simple story.Anjali Sharma, with her husband, Aditya, who works on cruise liner and their son, move to Goa and when they inform several taxi drivers as to where they want to go, all except one, refuse to take them. Enroute to the house, the driver informs them that the house is haunted and soon Aditya has to go to work, leaving Anjali to set up everything and including sending their son to a nearby school. One night, upon waking up, she sees her son looking for an ice cream bowl that he dropped only moments back. He even tells her that he has seen a ghost. But soon the ghost and the little boy become friends.The movie stars Amitabh Bachchan, Juhi Chawla, Satish Shah, Rajpal Yadav, Lalit Parasher and both Priyanshu and Shah Rukh Khan make a friendly appearance. This is produced by Ravi Chopra and is directed by Vivek Sharma.This movie, to an extent, has the echoes of "Baghban" where family drama is concerned and is a good comedy where the friendship between the boy and the ghost, as well as Rajpal Yadav and Satish Shah are concerned. But the friendship between the ghost and the son is more like a relationship between a grandson and grandfather. Besides the director, Vivek Sharma, roping in two of the most popular Bollywood stars, in his directorial debut, what is really interesting the family drama angle of the story - its not just for children as some have suggested or as some think, its also for adults.The music by Vishal - Shekhar is quite melodious and worth listening and more so when Amitabh sings.Conclusion: This is one movie that is worth while watching with family, including children. But if a family drama does make you cry, then I suggest you take some tissues with you." 
" He is still the Baap of Bollywood....","At 66 you don't expect an Indian actor to romp in skull Caps, Cargo Pants and Designer goggles.But he does it and carries it off with finesse even while playing a lovable Bhoot(ghost) to an 8 year old..The camaraderie between Amitabh and Aman, the kid,is just so lovable that you wouldn't want this to end and even when your eyes are moist you still would be loving it.. A simple story told in even simpler format by Vivek Sharma touches your strings. The music is okay, so is the cinematography but what stands out is the chemistry between the duo and its fun to see an 8 year old standing and matching shoulders with the greatest actor of all times..But, in any case it's a movie worth watching this summer and might provide for some good lessons on forgiveness. As for parents, watch out for the athletic meet scene where Amitabh explains that success can be achieved only by hard work and not magic- A good lesson to be learnt...And yeah Juhi Chawla is good and so is Shahrukh Khan who is there for a few scenes..Go watch this at least its far better than the so called mindless movies dished out..Do take a few tissues with you..You might just need them but wouldn't mind nevertheless.." 
" Sweet Film","Bhootnath may be inspired by Casper the friendly ghost but it has a different story. The first half was quite childish although it wasn't that bad but the second half was so good that it saved the whole film. In other words it had a little bit of everything for every age e.g. First half is for children & second half is for adults. The film had a very nice, funny, emotional and heart touching relationship between a little boy and a ghost.It is the directorial debut of Vivek Sharma and is produced by the team behind Baghban & Baabul. This year their have been extremely disappointing directorial debut films that were completely rubbish like U Me aur Hum & Tashan but Bhootnath isn't. It also has been a long time since Shah Rukh Khan & Juhi Chawla came back together on screen. I have always liked their on screen chemistry ever since I've seen Darr, so I was glad to see them together again. The music is OK and they will appeal to children and the only catchy song is Mere Buddy.The only scene I didn't like is the very first song were all the children are dressed up like teenagers, I felt like it was unnecessary and did not suit the mood for the film otherwise Bhootnath is a very sweet film that leaves a smile on your face throughout and I also liked the teacher who steals all the lunch-boxes and the photo of him on his desk eating a huge sandwich was really funny. The opening credits was interesting when the candle burned out and the smoke turned into the title of the movie." 
" Entertaining Stuff with two Amitabh's, one 8+ and one 60+.","Frankly speaking after some big recent flops, I decided to leave all my expectations at home before watching "Bhoothnath". And what a pleasant and quality surprise it was. Director Vivek Sharma's debut movie is purely as per the tradition of BR films, who believe in simple family dramas told in a sober way. It is not a scary movie at all, but on the contrary it is a loving, emotional family movie, mainly for the kids.As a cool breeze in the summer, here comes a novel script with a new outlook towards the "Atma" phenomenon. Don't expect a tried and tested formula, as the movie does have some fresh content with an emotional touch. The usual family drama is also there which can be termed as the trademark of BR films. But putting all together you will enjoy watching it with your family, especially with the kids.The main character of the movie is a 8 year old "Aman Siddiqui" playing "Bonku" who becomes friend with the spirit in his house. Amitabh Bachhan plays the old man (the spirit) living in the house and is visible only to Bonku. The child Aman has given a splendid performance high on confidence. He has delivered an act at par with the veterans. Amitabh Bachhan has again proved that he is the "one & only" in the industry capable of giving such performances at this age. The people who gave comments about his retirement should start searching places to hide after seeing Bhoothnath.Though the movie starts a little slow but then picks up fast as the spirit is introduced. The first scene of Bonku's interaction with Amitabh is well executed and has excellent special effects. The best scene comes before the interval when Bonku gets injured in an accident. This well written and brilliantly executed scene at once connects you with the key characters and you start enjoying the movie more.The second half is heavy on emotions, but all the emotions are on the happy side. You enjoy the tears along with the happenings on the screen. The last 20 minutes of the movie are very well written and directed. The director is right on his tracks all the way and does a brilliant job in his first venture. He shows his hold over the medium as he talks to the point and has very less unwanted scenes in the script. It is clear that he doesn't believe in too much style but believes in content told in a simple but impressive way, without any gloss.Performance wise, no doubt both Aman & Amitabh are at the top of the list. Juhi Chawla is fresh and bubbly as ever. Surprisingly Shahrukh Khan (in special appearance) gives a very soft and underplayed performance and manages to impress in the few scenes he had. There is one under-rated actor in the movie who shines bright in the climax and he is Priyanshu Chatterjee. He is a bundle of talent still waiting for the right opportunity to come his way and he proves this in his small role in the movie. Satish Shah is enjoyable as the School Principal but Rajpal Yadav is completely wasted as a mad man.The weakest point of the movie is its music by Vishal & Shekhar. This is their second let down in a row after "Tashan". If only they had given some better songs, the movie would have been more enjoyable. Still it was nice to hear Amitabh & Juhi Chawla singing a song. Sukhwinder's voice was perfect in the climax song. And the act by Aman & Amitabh was of first rate in the song "Mere Buddy". They both look very cute together in the Hip Hop avtar.In nutshell, "Bhootnath" is an entertaining family movie, with two Amitabh's in it, one 8+ and one 60+. It looses point only due to its music." 
" A nice and clean entertainer","When i went to the movie, i was expecting it to be a kiddish movie, and since it is coming from Bollywood, i thought the presentation and the special effects would be amateurish.. But i must say, i was really surprised by the movie narration and direction. The special effects were fantastic, of the standards i have seen in Hollywood movies (seriously i am not kidding on this...), particularly the introduction scene where Amitabh tries to frighten the kid. Also the part with the dry leaves have also been handled very deftly both from the technology point of view and from the story narration point of view. On the whole without realizing i enjoyed the movie thoroughly. I am taking out the 1 point, if only the ending could have been more crispier... Check out for its sequel ..!!!. Go for it .. Trust me, you will not be disappointed." 
" Spirit In The Material World","Yet another good performance from the indefatigable Amitabh Bachchan - the man has had such high standards over the decades and has generally kept up to them. This very moral tale was apparently inspired by Caspar but seems to me to owe slightly more (in spirit) to The Ghost And Mrs. Muir (Hollywood, 1947).A family move into a house haunted by friendly old ghost Amitabh, who strikes up a warm and honest relationship with their son Aman. There's plenty of genuine family entertainment with a few nice songs and it starts out very well but the film eventually gets bogged down in vapid sentimentality, albeit always with a high moral tone. Avuncular Amitabh is the only reason to stay to the end, to see him go through every conceivable emotion, although one of my favourite pieces was Samay Ka Pahiya sung at the climax. I felt it when he fell all the way down the stairs even if he didn't! SRK had a minor part, but as with the main players was not well-used - only chubby Aman shone in his special relationship with the ghost. And some nice photography with faultless production. So, fairly good but not particularly memorable - a pleasant way to fill a couple of hours." 
" Good Film","Children and Adults will enjoy this movie. Well acted by all and good special effects. Heartwarming and funny. It is an original script too, not a remake of any other film. Shah Rukh Khan is in a special appearance in this film and I admit he was the main reason why I had watch, and he was in the film throughout which was a nice surprise. Amitabh does a role different from before and does well. The newcomer boy who plays Banku is also very good and natural. Juhi is beautiful and very funny in this film as are the other supporting actors in the film. I would recommend anybody to see this move at least once. It was worth the wait." 
" Entertaining...but could have been better","The film starts out well...family shifts into desolate, haunted mansion...child stumbles onto resident (but friendly) spirit...makes friends...get the picture? This premise could have been turned into an unforgettable children's movie...throw in some CGI effects, school pranks, the bully at school, a treasure hunt maybe? This formula works...at least in the first half of the film and you rush to get more popcorn and ice cream for the kids anticipating the fun and games that follow in the second half as well...Alas, this is where it comes apart...for some strange reason the script decides to get into the story of the spirit and how he got there in the first place...what a waste of a brilliant plot! What follows instead of a laugh riot in the second half is a melodramatic and clichéd saga of parents being neglected by a heartless son and a story of forgiveness and liberation. The story is well told in Bollywood melodrama style, no problem there - but what is this bit doing in a kiddie movie?! Im sure the filmmakers want to educate children on the rights and the wrongs of life and build moral character and all that...but not after setting the tone for a fun filled light hearted comic caper about a friendly bhoot! My problem with the movie is the way the script changes track from being a wholesome summer entertainer to a rather serious tear-jerking sermon about duties towards parents and liberation of an unsatisfied soul...Technically, the movie is excellent...great cinematography...brilliant visuals...some really stunning shots of Goa, neat editing and a passable music score.Performances: AB is brilliant as ever, proving once again that this is one actor who continues to amaze us with his versatility and dedication to the role. AB looks and feels every bit the Bhoothnath that he portrays. Juhi Chawla comes up with a good performance as the exasperated mother and SRK is thankfully restrained. Satish Shah as the school principal tickles the funny bone with his fake "irani" accent and Rajpal Yadav plays the drunken bum to the hilt. The icing on the cake though is the performance of the child artiste Aman Siddiqui who plays the lively, cherubic four year old.This could have been the ideal summer holiday movie, but for the second half!" 
" Watch with and for the Kids... Deserves a Look","The story of a good and friendly ghost portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan. Amitabh has given an astounding performance, but than his was a performance of his little co-star from Amitabh's own native town of Allahabad, Aman Sddiqui. This boy has a great future ahead. Juhi and Shahrukh did their cameos in a justified way.Rajpal Yadav was hilarious as usual. Music was good and soothing to the ears. The story line was not that strong, but if the movie was made to be targeting the "Krissh" audience and their guardians, we should not be complaining. The media publicity about the story changes in the end to make its sequel in the near future was a good way for keeping the kids happy and guessing for what would be their in the next version. Overall, deserves a watch with and for the kids during this summer vacations." 
" Mr B Does it Better","Right from Scene 1, Shot 1  I knew what I was going to expect. The very first scene of this movie shows two people trespassing into an abandoned home and being scared away by a ghost. Um, sounds familiar  awe, come one! You watched it in Casper, didn't you? Yep, so did I.Bhoothnath is a movie that loosely inspires itself from the 1995 Hollywood movie Casper. It's about a ghost (Amitabh Bachchan), who doesn't allow anyone inside his home but fails every attempt to scare a little boy out of the house. Soon, he discovers that this boy isn't afraid of him at all and then they develop friendship. Then there is this mother (played by Juhi Chawla), a principal (Satish Shah) and a variety of other supporting actors  and yes, I almost forgot to tell you, there is Shahrukh Khan as well. So to all those people out there who love these star studded no-substance movies  welcome aboard.The basic problem of Bhoothnath is that the spine of the story is very very flaccid. It's simply about this little boy and a ghost who do nothing but develop intense love for each other. They become friends, hang out, take part in sports and drama contests and well, that's about it. Can't tell you a great deal of things because the film simply deals with more event-oriented storytelling. Then there are these characters who do not develop at all, there are comedians who fail every attempt to make you laugh (though Juhi is funny at times, those clichéd jokes simply take away from humour from the situation.) In fact, the film is so clichéd that watching the first 20 minutes will tell you most of the story, but then that's where things become a bit tricky, and believe it or not, I grew more and more inquisitive as the film started taking a bloody Baghban twist. Surprised, don't be  it's BR Films trademark.I went absolutely stunned when the back story about Mr AB becoming a ghost started unfolding. It's about these helpless parents whose son has left them, and believe it or not, that the mother DIES in grief and father (Bachchan) meets an accident (well, falls off a flight of stairs) and dies. (Though I loved the scene when he discovers he's dead.) Then he decides to keep everyone off his property and that's the part supposed to scare us.Character-wise, Mr Bachchan is fine. Well, over acted a bit here and there, but one thing is for sure that he is able to get into any character. He fits in this one as well. He still manages to make us adore him with unwashed clothes (the movies says so) and unfiled nails with hideous silver paint on his face. Juhi Chawla is opening up to experimental roles and glad she accepted this part. She has fully justified her character and has shown that's she'd good as a mom too. The Shahrukh-Juhi chemistry works this time around too, but I simply did not understand the reason to have SRK do that role.For Heaven's sake, just picture SRK standing in the background and only his hands visible in the frame. What a waste. Thankfully he did not charge a penny for that role because if he would've, it would make his worse choice of character in his entire career. Delnaz Paul, Priyanshu Chaterjee and Rajpal Yadav too are such a waste of paychecks. Satish Shah is rather irritating than funny. Rajpal Yadav sucks big time and we're not even told what happens to him in the end.However, the good thing is that we have yet another Darsheel Safary in the block. Little kid charms us all the way through the movie. The best moments of the film are credits to him. The scene where he challenges Nath to arrange the furniture was simply adorable and the other one when he's looking up in the sky and calling out to Bhoothnath.Overall, there's nothing great you'd want to watch in this movie. Your kids (mind it, very very small kids with absolutely no sense of judgement) may find it nice, but even 12/13 years will find this movie going to the nuts. It's predictable, it doesn't make use of the comic potential the plot has to offer, big names are attached to the film but their presence does not add any substance to the movie at all. You'll simply hate some scenes for the rest of your life. Music is so-so. Vishal Shekhar flunk again after Tashan. Javed Akthar had given some nice compositions but I think they're a bit over the top for a kid's movie. Production design (ageing dept) sucks big times, especially the first time we're shown this aged building with brightly polished wooden door and shining door knobs. Background score is thrilling at times but couldn't understand the reason why they composed one particular score very identical to that of Baghban's. There was definitely more room for special effects (you'll love a leaves animation sequence) though what's been done feels right in the place.The director definitely needs to come up with something better next time because with such a big production house, all the best choices of actors and still a big hole persists in the whole thing. I don't know what went wrong  but Bhoothnath failed to impress me.6/10  for you Mr. Bachchan. Been a big fan of yours." 
" Well how kiddie can u be?","Kiddie films are so difficult to make, yet some people think it's easy Show a school, show a naughty child, show some forced emotional angles, some songs like MERA BUDDY and ready Show some emotional scenes like he falling off a staircaseHere Ravi Chopra go a step furtherShow a kiddish Bhoot, who instead of frightening the kid acts like a funny Bhoot, This was meant to be funny? There is some good chemistry between Bachchan and the child but later-on when the focus shifts to the melodramatic events the film gets so boringRavi Chopra doesn't know where to go, maybe he felt that he should put some melodrama to make the film look smart and appeal to the audiences of all ages, sadly it didn'tThe director gives a back story to the Bhoot of being a sad person whose Son didn't treat him well straight out of BAGHBAN and that ruins the story and also the Bhoot characterAmitabh acts well and is the best part of the film The Kid is also endearing Shahrukh Khan has few scenes, he has his moments but he looks too tired Juhi Chawla plays the modern day mother, who has an unbelievable sense of humor, she impresses in parts Rajpal does provide some funny scenes Priyanshu is good in a clichéd role" 
" Take your kids to this movie","He sings and dances, arranges the furniture, and even puts the school's lunchbox-raiding principal in place. Yes, that's Bhoothnath for you, the friendly ghost played by Amitabh Bachchan, in director Vivek Sharma's film by the same name. After a failed attempt at scaring away little Banku and his family who have moved into his sprawling Goa bungalow, Bhoothnath becomes buddies with the precocious kid. So far, not too many complaints. It's silly and childish yes, but also very watchable. Problems arise somewhere beyond the half-way mark of Bhoothnath when this kids-friendly entertainer turns into something of a rona-dhona heavy Baghbaan rehash. You sink into your seat and cringe with embarrassment as our teary-eyed ghost goes into flashback mode and bores us with those sad stories of his neglectful son. Despite its fairly basic plot and predictable screenplay, for the most part Bhoothnath works just fine as a children's film. It is after all a formula that never fails when done even half right. Although it's nothing you haven't seen before, the adventures of Banku and Bhooth are enjoyable to watch largely because the chemistry between Bachchan and child actor Aman Siddique is so riveting. So whether they're pulling a gag on the school principal, or devouring "aloo parathas" that Banku's mother is struggling to prepare, it's this unlikely friendship between boy and ghost that is the film's main draw. And that's why it hurts as hell when writer-director Vivek Sharma steers his ship in an entirely different direction as the film enters its third act. Melodramatic and needless, the track involving Bhoothnath's back-story is a cumbersome bore. Even Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla, who play Banku's parents in the film, look embarrassed to be participating in such sentimental silliness. For me Chhota Chetan and Mr India are the ultimate children's films, at least to come out of India . Bhoothnath, sadly doesn't compare to either. For one, both Chhota Chetan and Mr India were involving and engaging stories that had heart. Bhoothnath, seen in its entirety, is a confused film at best. Sure it's got its moments, but it's hardly the kind of film you'll remember years from now. The other reason Bhoothnath doesn't come anywhere close to a film like Mr India is because it simply doesn't push the envelope as far as special effects are concerned. 20 years after Mr Indiaand the best Bhoothnath does is show us furniture flying around a room, Bachchan walking in and out of walls, a child's arm elongating to ridiculous proportions, and some gimmicks involving dried leaves. Such a shame, one would have expected more! Of the cast, Shah Rukh Khan in a special appearance looks uninspired and unhappy to be there, while the usually dependable Juhi Chawla tends to over-act for no reason. Some genuinely funny moments are provided by Rajpal Yadav who plays the local drunk, but of course the film belongs to Bachchan and little fellow Aman Siddique who give the film its best moments. Siddique is sharp and on-the-ball and he turns in a sincere performance, but if I were to pick the one single thing about Bhoothnath that's superb, then that would be Amitabh Bachchan. He's perfectly cast, he's uninhibited as the scruffy, irritable ghost, and even in the film's tedious bits he's the only reason you stay in your seats. Take your kids to the film, but make sure you don't stay longer than intermission!" 
" Boo Boo Bhoothnath","Bhootnath doesn't work primarily because the objective is not clear in the first place. It gets sandwiched between a children's move and social drama. Pity it doesn't justify both and falls flat and even 2hours seems a drag.To determine what makes it tick, the director should have done his homework well. Nevertheless, being a first timer it can be pardoned -but you missed a brilliant opportunity to strike it gold!.The pranks fall flat - it's an "infant's play" for the kids of today's generation. And the Bhoothnath's magic, I don't think it would even tickle a bone.The chemistry between Big B and Amaan is OK. Pity the story lets down and not giving scope to raise to a different level.Juhi:: Again the story is the culprit for not providing scope.SRK:: Surprisingly, his role and performance are justified to the "T".Raghuvir Yadav:: Why force him to reprise Kesto Mukhejee? Priyanshu:: The crocodile-tears were a bit over the top alright? Music:: Not worthy of being mentioned.CGI deserves a special mention.And Chopra Saab, let go your obsession for "Baghbaan". Not every time please! Aur bhi gam hain zamaane mein.....PS: Sequel, don't even think about it!"
