" Sharman Joshi Shines!","Rajesh Mapuskar's 'Ferrai Ki Sawaari' is a decent film, that relishes on simplicity. However, this film's actual merit is its leading man, the sinfully under-rated Sharman Joshi, who shines in his part & delivers a career best performance. 'Ferrai Ki Sawaari' Synopisis: How the pursuit of an Indian cricket legend's Ferrari makes a young boy's dreams of playing cricket at Lords a reality.Rajesh Mapuskar & Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Screenplay is simple & uncomplicated. Its a decent story about dreams & hope. However, the writing in the first-hour, is extremely slow. Rajesh Mapsukar's Direction is noble. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are fine. Music by Pritam, is ordinary.Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Sharman Joshi delivers a career best performance. He's excellent from start to end. Boman Irani has essayed this kinda character a number of times before, but the actor manages to impress, as always. Ritvik Sahore is a talented, sincere performer. Deepak Shirke is amazing, so is the entire supporting case. Acting Giant Paresh Rawal stuns in a cameo, while Vidya Balan's item number is energetic. On the whole, Watch 'Ferrari Ki Sawaari' for its simplicity & Sharman Joshi's winning performance." 
" Film with a heart of gold","This is a modern day fairy story with a heart of gold. Slightly manipulative emotionally but forgivably so.Sharman, a Parsi, chronic do-gooder, an honest RTO officer, probably below the new Parsi poverty line of Rs 90,000 pm, wants to send his son, Ritvik, to a cricket coaching camp at Lords, London. He's a cinch to get selected but the only hitch is the Rs 1.5 lac fee. Many loan rejections later, the only way out seems to be via a wedding planner, Seema . Who's willing to give him the amount as a gift if he can arrange a Ferrari for a few hours. So that a corrupt corporator's useless son can get married in it. The problem is, there is only one Ferrari in Mumbai. Belonging to Sachin Tendulkar.Another problem is posed by Sharman's dad, Boman Irani, who hates cricket, thinks most cricketers are salesmen. And is dead against sending his grandson for the camp.The story line is simple and thankfully remains so through the film, with possibly my only issue being with the suicide angle and the breakdown towards the end. Else, it remains light, chirpy and cheerful all the way through. The film is lit up by some very well written characters and excellent performances. The waiter at the Mumbai Cricket Association who wants an autograph because in an inconsequential match 38 years ago, the cricketer had taken 8 wickets on a dead pitch. The bumbling but good hearted security guard at Sachin's flat. Sharman's boss who informs him that the wheels of loans against Provident Fund grind correctly but exceedingly slowly. The cop nicknamed Mahatma Gandhi. The corporators dramebaaz son. The cricket coach. The bubbly wedding planner. The gun happy corporator. Sharman and Boman, who do an as expected great job. And above all, I loved the son. His smile lights up the screen and our hearts in a truly honest performance.The background music, with the cricket song and also the title song deserving special mention. Keeps the mood effervescent through the film. Some moments, as mentioned above, and an unnecessary lavani number by Vidya Balan are the only discordant notes in the film, everything else being spot on.The film is about our nations obsession with cricket. How it touches the hearts of millions. Of how some of our cricketers inspire a few hundred thousand to dedicate their lives to the sport. Its about the simple but sometimes forgotten values of life. Honesty. Behaving correctly. Doing good. And about something that most current newspaper headlines make us forget. That good things happen to good people" 
" Take a humorous and emotional ride with the Ferrari...","An aspiring cricketer son Kayo (Ritwik Sahore) and his completely pessimist grandfather Deboo (Boman Irani); Rustam (Sharman Joshi) lives in a small world with a big dream that he and his son have seen together; to send Kayo to Lords, London, for cricket-training and finally get him into the Indian cricket team. The only hurdle in front of him is the 1.5 lac rupees that he has to collect for his son's trip. Here, comes the 'Ferrari' into picture as the most unexpected and the best ever help. But with it, comes another grand adventure in the life of Rustam. Rajkumar Hirani's latest offer Ferrari Ki Sawaari is a must watch this season. The simple yet powerful storyline, the strong characters (even the supporting actors are commendable), and of course, the dashing and the dazzling red beauty Ferrari; the Vidhu-Raju magic has worked again.Sharman Joshi as the simpleton and the clean hearted widower becomes the show stealer of the movie with his stupendous performance. He perfectly fitted into the middle class family scenario wherein he is the only bread winner. He entirely carried the movie in the best way possible and he could finally say that this is his solo lead.Boman Irani, as the totally pessimist father who later turns out to be the soft hearted grandpa, showcased another of his commendable performances.Young Ritwik gave an impressive performance as the mature and understanding son, Kayo. Paresh Rawal shined in his small yet intense role.Director Rajesh Mapuskar did a great job by introducing a different story that actually moves you. The father-son relations between two different generations and the level of understanding, really grip you throughout the movie. Though certain scenes seem to be a little unwanted, they are soon overshadowed by the brillinat scenes later. Sachin Tendulkar's invisible importance in the movie is unavoidable.Though the music does not play much of an importance in the movie, it is enjoyable. You might even forget that Vidya had made a friendly appearance in the movie.Watch Ferrari Ki Sawaari for Sharman Joshi and his adventurous ride with the Ferrari." 
" A Tochy Father And Son Tale Which Has It's Heart At The Right Place :)","It wouldn't be wrong if I said Vidhu Vinod Chopra has become a factory which mostly produces a set of good at heart, inspirational yet thought provoking movies. 'Ferrari Ki Sawaari' is no exception. The job this time is given to débutant director Rajesh Mapuskar who earlier was the assistant director in 3 idiots. A simple and honest RTO officer, Sharman Joshi as Rusy (Rustam Deboo) falls in a dilemma when his promising cricketer son Ritvik Sahore as Kayo (Kayoze Rustam Deboo) gets an opportunity to join a cricket camp in London but requires a fee of 1.5 lakh rupees. To add to that we have Boman Irani as Father of Rusy who himself was a very talented cricketer but was betrayed by his friend during the final selection and thus considers cricket a waste of time. When a glimmer of hope knocks at the door as Sharman is promised the sum of money in place of a Ferrari ride for a few hours he steals it from Sachin Tendulkar's house. What happens then forms the crust of the story. The good thing about such movies is that even if they have 2 or 3 scenes that have that emotional and feel good touch it becomes terribly hard to hate them. And FRS has them. Pritam's music is mostly enjoyable although I did find Vidya Balan's item number unnecessary. Sharman Joshi gives a strong performance proving that he too can pull off lead roles and Kayoze does pretty well too. Actually, in a few scenes I was astonished to see how closely Kayoze's expressions and dialogue delivery resemble to that of Sharman . But Boman Irani steals the show for me. Still, I cannot say that the film lies in the same place as Munna Bhai. It could have easily been 15 minutes shorter and a bit more compact. Nonetheless, it has it's heart at the right place which makes it a good watch. 2.5/5" 
" Inspires to think BIG , a joyful + emotional ride=SUPER HIT","This movie is a must watch for all. There's a lot to learn from it. I had not much expectations from this movie but it throbbed by heart. Since it's Vidhu Vinod Chopra's script i gave it a try. Sharman Joshi(Rusy) played it good. it deliberately inspires you, the movie teaches lay people about how to set an example to our children especially single fathers who raise kids all by themselves. Few scenes may bring tears, this movie is about how a struggling dad tries to full fill his son's dream. Paresh Raval has played a villain's role in this movie. In-spite of the movie having no romance triangle like any other Hindi movies but it delivery is outstanding. I assure you that it wont be disappointing-Ferrari Ki Sawaari I reckon families to watch this movie. it' 7.5/10" 
" The honest and the modest can also dream big","Ferrari Ki Sawaari is said to be similar to Iqbaal (2005) but in fact, it is closer to a few other old Bollywood movies. It reminds of Ehsaas (2001) because of the touching father-son relationship and the father's leaving no stone unturned for his son's victory in life and fulfillment of his dreams. Besides, it reminisces of Raj Kapoor's movie - Kal Aaj Aur Kal (1971) on account of showing three generations living together under a single roof, trying to adjust with one another. There is a conflict between the oldest generation (grandfather) and the youngest generation (grandson) and the twilight generation (father) tries to console both and reconcile between them. Further, its climax scene in the office of the Cricket association where the protagonist warns the negative character against playing with his son's happiness, is quite similar to the climax scene of Khatta Meetha (1978) in which Ashok Kumar threatens Pradeep Kumar the same way Sharman Joshi threatens Paresh Rawal in this movie. Coincidentally, Khatta Meetha also tells the story of a Paarsi family just like Ferrari Ki Sawaari. Again, this movie draws parallel to a relatively recent movie - Do Dooni Chaar (2010) in which the honest protagonist (Rishi Kapoor) finally decides against deviating from his ethics to fulfill the urgent monetary need and gets a pleasant surprise in the end when an unexpected solution emerges for the problem. However, despite so many illustrations meant for a sense of deja vu, Ferrari Ki Sawaari has an originality of its own. It's unique in its own right and deserves admiration. It's a movie whose heart lies in the right place.Rustam (Sharman Joshi) has seen his highly talented Cricketer father - Behraamji Deboo's frustration and he himself also is living a mediocre life as a salaried employee. Despite the opposition of his father (Boman Irani), he is hell-bent upon arranging everything required for fulfillment of his talented son's dream to become a successful Cricketer. When an opportunity arrives for his son's attending a training camp at Lord's (England) with a cost of Rs. 1.5 Lakh rupees, he knocks every probable door for money and gets disappointment only in return. A wedding planner (Seema Paahwa) tells him that if he is able to arrange Sachin Tendulkar's Ferrari car for a few hours to be used in the wedding of a politician's son, he will get the required money as his remuneration for that service. The storyline picks up this clue and reaches the climax after meandering through many twists and turns, some believable, some unbelievable but all being entertaining.Ferrari Ki Sawaari impresses very much in the first half. I can imagine several spectators flowing with the incidents taking place on the screen with the protagonist just like me. Despite, almost everything being perfectly predictable, it influences and moves the viewer. The second half is mostly over the top and tones down the profound mood of the movie. And that's why it is not that impressive. Frankly speaking, the second half drags just too much and while watching it, I felt that the track of the minister's son was completely superfluous in the post-interval session. The movie could have been shortened by a few reels. The length has only reduced its positive impact on the audience. Vidya Baalan's item song is also quite unnecessary. It's a pity that box office oriented thinking turns outstanding movies into good ones.Technically, the movie is good. The modest layout of the residence of the principle characters and the realistic set-up of the locality, both make the movie as relatable by the Indian lower middle class people. Music by Preetam is also quite good. The best song, in my opinion, is Aye Mere Mann (sung by Shyamantan Das).All the three main characters of this movie - Sharman Joshi, Boman Irani and Ritvik Sahore have delivered towering performances. Sharman Joshi is such a natural actor that he can fit the bill for any character and I am tempted to categorize him with late Sanjeev Kumar. Boman and Ritvik do not lag behind him in entering the skins of their respective characters. The supporting cast has also done exceedingly well. Seema Paahwa as the kind-hearted wedding planner, takes the cake.Dreaming does not come under anybody's monopoly or patent or copyright. It's not the fiefdom of the rich, the resourceful and the mighty. Corruption and dishonesty have got a strong justification in India that they are unavoidable to earn enough money to give a better life to the next generation. But Ferrari Ki Sawaari tells that there is no need to be dishonest to dream big for your offspring (if you are already not rich and resourceful). The honest and the modest are also entitled to dream big for themselves as well as their children." 
" Ride is just like in an economical class car not the luxurious one.","Watched "FERRARI KI SAWAARI". Ride was just like an economical class car ride not the luxurious one. It is an average movie. Positive mouth publicity seems difficult. First few scenes are really impressive. They tried to make realistic cinema but it is not very easy. After few scenes, they kneeled down to the word cinematic liberty. They misused it very well. Even the main plot of Ferrari was very fictitious, some time at the level of being illogical. If the movie belongs to 2012 then how can one relate that an honest head clerk of R.T.O can't manage to collect one lac and fifty thousand rupees. Dialogues by Mr. Rajkumar Hirani are enjoyable. Performance of Mr. Boman Irani is par excellence. Sharman Joshi is quite good even the boy Ritwik Sahore is very good. Music is not massy or classy. They tried to put some commercial aspect by keeping an item no but not the music, choreography or performances are enjoyable. They used graphics also to lure the kids but nowadays kids are very smart. Just after watching the few frames they can easily tell that is it Spiderman part..... It will not work in single screen but in multiplexes will work till some extent but one shouldn't give credit to the film for this, it is the big banner and their reputation." 
" The Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Raju Hirani combination has done it again! Another classic satire from their stable.","Film: Ferrari Ki Sawaari (2012) Rating: 8/10 stars Reviewed By: DareDevikKid_DDKA truly heartwarming film. The last time I had laughed, cried, felt emotional, felt chocked, and enjoyed and even sneered at a slice of life all simultaneously was when the same team had served us the scrumptious '3 Idiots'. A classic feel-good satire in the same vein as 'Mr. Deeds Goes To Town', 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington', 'Meet John Doe', 'Modern Times', and our very own 'Munnabhai MBBS' among other masterpieces of the genre.All the performances from the lead, to the supporting, and even down to the bit players are rendered with passion and near surgical perfection. If Sharman Joshi is a revelation & Boman Irani tugs at your heart with a role he can sleepwalk through, then Kayo will be an inspiration to kids all over - I had already overheard a few kids enthusiastically telling their parents about their own aspirations with childlike fervor while leaving the theater.Also, expect this film to pick up quite a few nominations come awards season. Most expected nods should go to Sharman Joshi & Boman Irani for their fine performances; Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Rajkumar Hirani & Rajesh Mapuskar for their excellent screenplay; and perhaps, Rajesh Mapuskar might even sneak in an additional nod in the Direction category. Rush to your nearest cinema-hall immediately and feast your senses with a near perfect execution of a feel-good satire. Most of all, watch it for one factor which it dishes out in copious amounts, and one which our society is badly in need of - "HOPE"......."LOTS OF HOPE"!" 
" A near perfect, one of the best FAMILY films of 2012 reminding you of 3 Idiots.","To start with FERRARI KI SAWAARI may not be a perfect film since it does have its flaws including its over length and few avoidable scenes & songs. But ignoring its weak points the film is indeed "One of the Best FAMILY movies of 2012" which even reminds you of another perfect family entertainer, 3 IDIOTS presented by the same production house. The film obviously revolves around the subject of Cricket and A Ferrari, yet it's not entirely a SPORTS movie as you might be thinking. On the contrary, it is a film based on relationship between a father, a son and a grandfather. In poetic words it's a film based on cricket where the team consists of only 3 players and the rest all are simply cheering for them in their own unique ways. FKS firstly becomes an enjoyable experience for everyone because of its emotional theme which talks about the most untouched or tense relationship in a middle class family that is between a father and his son. It enlightens a young father about how to bring in more positivity into this important bonding taking it onto a different level altogether.Secondly it very importantly teaches you the value of Forgiveness when a person simply forgets and forgives his dear friend for having played a dirty game with him (ruining his entire life), arising out of professional jealousy & greed. And I rate a particular scene in the film, between Boman & Paresh as one of the best scenes of current times, capable of teaching you the art of forgiveness in just a few seconds. Thirdly but most importantly, FKS actually gets converted into a worth watching film because of its two flawless performances by Sharman Joshi and Boman Irani wherein they both quietly surpass their own benchmarks set in their other famous masterpiece 3 IDIOTS. Sharman Joshi is simply exceptional in his simple yet impressive performance of an honest father. He infuses great positive energy in the entire film, especially in the opening and last 15 minutes when you honestly cannot stop falling in love with his character on screen. Complimenting him beautifully there is Boman Irani who undoubtedly is one of the most talented character actors in Hindi Film Industry at present. Boman simply takes over from Sharman like a relay race post intermission and delivers an even better performance than his 3 Idiots. Completing the trio is Ritwik Sahore, the kid who despite of being placed in front of such great actors, superbly makes his presence felt with elegance. Further, this team of 3 gets great encouragement from a brilliant supporting cast lead by Seema Pahwa, who is superb as the wedding planner and completely steals the show in many of her scenes.Paresh Rawal is bang on in his short cameo and so are the other actors contributing a lot in the overall impact of the film. Cinematography adds to the excitement related with the Ferrari along with a fine background score. But musically, Pritam is just OK with nothing great as one does not remember the songs once out of the theater. The tag line of the review calls it a 'near perfect' film since FKS does have few weaker moments in its narration which could have been tackled in a better manner. For instance the complete side track of a corrupt politician and his son's wedding seems to be a bit over the top with many cardboard like characters. The plot also takes too many liberties with the Ferrari moving freely on the roads without being noticed and the song with the car flying in the air in reality looks absurd and avoidable. As seen in many earlier movies on cricket, the scenes featuring the game once again remain the weakest ones. Like, how can one look for hitting the wickets when the ball is being pitched way outside the off-stump (when Boman is bowling to his grandson)? Now as mentioned before, Why I would like to ignore these drawbacks in totality? That's because we all lack one major feature in our lives which is called POSITIVE THINKING and FKS is full of the same positivity we all are looking for. We don't get to see such positive films too often and that doesn't mean that it is a 'weepy movie' at all. The film has a father and his son living their lonely life with a great positive attitude, people or neighbors helping out each other in the times of need and it even has good policemen, miles away from the routine kind of men on duty seen in every other film.Keeping that in mind, FERRARI KI SAWAARI is indeed one of the best FAMILY films of 2012. It is a fine first time attempt by director Rajesh Mapuskar backed by the same talented men (Vidhu Vinod Chopra & Raj Kumar Hirani), who gave us Munna Bhai films and 3 Idiots. So that should be another big reason why it deserves to be seen by all." 
" Ferrari Ki Sawaari is a joyride.","Many small joys makes you happier than a bigger one. Not only you but several hearts around. Just look at the brighter side of the life. Such is Vidhu Vinod Chopra's latest offering Ferrari Ki Sawaari, directed by Rajesh Mapuskar. No grand ambition, no superstar. Many small characters with huge hearts makes you feel rich good, if you see at the brighter side ignoring the subduing tad melodrama.Starts smoothly with bright picturisation of a poor Parsi family home in a Parsi colony and you are introduced with the three lead characters: Rustam (Sharman Joshi), an RTO Officer, good doer and obedient citizen who follows traffic rules also when there's no police around. His son Kayo (Ritwik Sahore) is a budding cricketer aspiring to make it to the cricket coaching camp at the Lord's, London, given his poor financial backdrop of the family. The eldest of the family, Rustam's father, Deboo (Boman Irani) was one of the best cricketer of his time who discontinued cricketing after he was sabotaged by his rival Dharmadhikari (Paresh Rawal).The ride picks up many characters that comes on the way: Babbu didi (Seema Pahwa) who wishes to have Ferrari in her locality at the wedding of the corporator's son Pakya (Nilesh Divekar). Rustam accidentally steals the red posh Ferrari of Sachin Tendulkar which brings two more playful characters - the driver and the watchman (Deepak Shirke) leading them onto the quest of the missing Ferrari. This is how the entire plot is constructed meticulously revolving around the huge dreams of small people.But, no Indian road is complete with potholes that jerks your ride. You can be pulled back by the taming melodrama but majority of the Indian cinema goers have developed a taste for it. And this is where recent Vidhu Vinod Chopra movies (Lage Raho, 3 idiots) find its comfort zone. But you are never let down and you get your proper dosage of gulp in the throat and teary eyed moments. This ride reaches its maximum speed at many turns, mainly due to the performances of each cast: be it Boman Irani in his rugged look or a car mechanic for very small time of appearance. Also, it is most enjoyable when in a scene the media covers the news of a suicide of a young boy leaving the news of forged mass wedding and Sachin's ferrari.Family entertainment films are on a steep low in Indian cinema in recent times. And you hardly get such one. Ferrari Ki Sawaari gives you a reason to spare some time with your family. Who knows when you'll get such movies at the theatres in future." 
" A fantasy!!","Ferrari Ki Sawaari is a joy ride, yes. But there is so much drama in this joy ride, that you stop enjoying it and wonder when it'll get over. But overall, it's a decent film. One might actually enjoy it, but it's very long and dramatic. It starts off with great intent, but becomes too much of a fantasy towards the end. It's nowhere close to the recent films from the Vidhu Vinod Chopra films (3 Idiots or the Munna Bhai series), but is a modest effort nevertheless.Acting: 7/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 7/10 Technical Aspects: 8/10 Is it worth your time and money??: Ferrari Ki Sawaari is a movie with its heart at the right place, but it just doesn't deliver enough. It's a family movie, for kids and parents will enjoy it, but I don't think youngsters will like it so much. Unless you want to take along your parents (like I did) or kids, wait for the DVD.For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)" 
" FKS is like a 'Ride on a regular Indian road with inevitable bumps'.","Its a sweet simple movie straight from the heart wit a lot of sincerity, having some beautiful moments that ensures a smile on your face. However the movie has enough hiccups that hampers its smooth flow ; too much unnecessary time is given to the scenes involving relatively unimportant characters which adds to the length of the film.Also FKS tries very hard which wasn't needed and the plot takes too many liberties in the end.Revealing those things will be a spoiler. The biggest strength of FKS lies in its lead characters' top notch performances.THe young kid looks confident in every scene and also he looks very similar to his on screen father,superb casting. Boman Irani as grumpy old man is superb .But its the under rated Sharman Joshi who is such a revelation in this film ,delivering his best yet and becoming the best reason to watch this film. watch out for the scene in which he pleads to a loan officer with a smile of hope of getting the loan ..outstanding expression. When Boman and Sharman are on screen they just raise the depth of those scenes.. Not a gr8 film but surely worth a watch .Such a nice clean film are very rare these days" 
" A simple, sweet and a totally enlightened movie!","Very very rare are the totally simplified films these days in the era of exaggerated and technology oriented movie making. Ferrari ki sawari is one such film that really makes you believe that simple movie making does really exist.Okay, now for the performances, Sharman Joshi gives a fabulous performance as the dad going to any deapth to uplift his talented son. However the real show stealer is none other than Boman Irani.Irani plays his role with such honesty and explicitly that one can't help but can either admire him or relate with him. His is simply phenomenal.Supporting both the actors is this young kid who plays the role of the son of Sharman. He is just amazing!Oh yes! Not to mention Paresh Rawal in a brief surprising role.Overall this film is really worth watching!" 
" Brilliant performances, Nice but a little long movie.","I loved the movie. It was funny, entertaining, emotional, light hearted.I would have loved it even more had the second half of the movie been a little shorter. But nevertheless, its a family movie apt to be watched with family on a lazy Sunday afternoon. They have tried to put a lot of things together in a single movie, and the people behind the movie have done a fantastic job of making it all come seamlessly together.The child actor has done a very good job. The concept is good, the direction is great. Only let down is the second half which is little impractical and dramatic unlike the relatable first half.The family dynamics can actually be felt. Brilliant performances by the lead actors.I wouldn't call it a must watch, though a movie is easily a 8/10." 
" A Ride Little Bumpy","Ferrari ki Sawari (FKS) is one of those movies which ends on a note so high, both emotionally and morally that you don't really have a choice but to summarize it as a 'good watch'.Its a movie set up in a world where everything would ultimately fall in place and has people who fall on the extreme ends of the human axis. Even in such an improbable world, director has been able to successfully fit in a juicy(carrying potential)enough script without making it much of an embarrassing affair. It would have been an elegant and far better piece of cinema had it been without its extended sub plots and some out of place characters. That would have automatically made it a shorter and crispier ride on the Ferrari. But then it would not have been a Vidhu Vinod Chopra Production.It goes without saying that the presence of Boman Irani was an absolute necessity for FKS to have its core in the right place. I wish he gets to do more of such roles where one can sit back and admire the talent this guy has and wonder where he was hiding before he broke into the scene. Of course it is Sharman Joshi who has come of age and has been satisfactorily able to carry the movie on his shoulders till the very end. It is a movie where you would leave the cinema hall thinking of it as a paisa vasool picture but at the same time you would know that you have somehow been tricked!! Go watch the movie for little flashes of brilliance and to have a feel good trip from the theatre exit to your car." 
" Amazing Movie","this movie is amazing i have seen this movie at least 1000 times and i am not tired of it i love Boman Irani in this movie and Paresh Rawal has a awesome part in the movie as well they show kayo family so poor and it is just awesome movie i would just rate this 10 out of 10 there is one problem in this movie everything is perfect but there is one thing missing they should have had Sachin Tendulkar in this but other then that everything in this movie is perfect i highly recommend you guys to go watch this movie i hope they give the kid kayo more movies and i hope he becomes a star they should make a Ferrari Ki Sawaari part 2 it is that good"
