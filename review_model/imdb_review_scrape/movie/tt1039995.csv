" An emotional film from the talented and sensitive couple.","There is not a long list of actors who also became successful directors. But first Aamir Khan successfully proved it and now Ajay Devgan also shows his sparks of direction.His directorial debut is a sensitive and emotional love story of a married couple. The real life pair Ajay & Kajol both fit to their roles as a 'T'. A special worthy praise is deserved by Kajol for her lovable act and Ajay for choosing a difficult subject.In simple words, U Me Aur Hum is not a family drama, it is not a film with bubbly valentine kind of love. But its intense, emotional and mature in content. Though it lacks in some departments but the overall impact at the end of the movie is quite touchy.The first half starts with influences of "An Affair To Remember" and "The Notebook". But after the marriage of the lead actors, the film just moves on to a different unexpected platform. The story is about the wife suffering with Alzheimer disease and how the family and friends around, face this truth with love and courage.No doubt a difficult subject to choose for a directorial debut. The only problem is that the viewers expected a good enjoyable love story with many lighter moments to share. But the film is more of a slow, heavy and mature love story. Still Ajay Devgan, the director, manages to extract brilliant performances and also visualizes some memorable scenes which can make your eyes wet. Specially the last hour of the film. It has some very emotional scenes to cherish.The most lacking department of the movie is the Music. If only it had some soothing and melodious love songs, the impact would have been 10 times better. There is no slow & soft love song with meaningful lyrics which was a must according to the demand of the script as I see it. May be Ajay avoided that deliberately. Vishal Bhardwaj misses the train this time.Performance wise Kajol is superlative and majestic in all her characters. As a smart waitress, as a girl ready to fall in love, as a lover, as a wife and as a mother. She slips into all shades of her character with such an ease and elegance. Unarguably one of her best performances till date. Ajay is soft and has underplayed his character, but he emotes well as a worried and caring husband. His performance in the second half is much better and impressive. Another gem of a performance is by Divya Dutta. She excels in her small role and makes her presence felt. The scenes where all the friends are together are well written and executed.It can be said that after "Taare Zameen Par" this is the second movie on the theme of a disease and how the family copes with it. But there should be no comparison drawn between the two. "U Me Aur Hum" is more for the mature audiences and it may be treated as "Heavy" by the younger generation.But the movie has the truth of life in it. Anybody can face this, as we all live in an uncertain life. And "U ME Aur Hum" teaches how to live life with love even when the times are real tough.Go for it if you love intense drama and feel that Love is the way to live Life. (I really wish it had better music)" 
" Refreshing Movie","I was very disappointed by Raju Chacha (which was produced by Ajay Devgan) and I was hoping U ME AUR HUM will not go the same way. And believe me I ended up enjoying the movie. Though I am not yet sure whether this a rip-off of some Hollywood movie, but was impressed with the cute love story, refreshing camera work, eye-catching colors, funny and enjoyable dialouges, good music (though it could have done with less songs) and last very very good acting by Ajay and Kajol.After Amir Khan, its Ajay Devgan's turn to impress. Strongly Recommended!!!8.5/10" 
" A watchable romantic drama that somehow loses the point","Ajay Devgan's directorial debut U, Me Aur Hum is quite interesting for its light and colourful background. But despite a promising combination of romance and drama, beautiful locations and two great actors who are perfect for their respective parts, it loses itself. It is lost within all the unnecessary jokes, the confusing flashbacks and the ever-changing sequences from present to past and vice-versa. It's a good story marred by unstable and average film-making. In the first half it heavily relies on comedy that does not really bring out great laughs. In the second, it is far more interesting but never really manages to remain consistent. The dialogues, the drama are uninspiring, as is the film. The film is generally watchable despite the weak script and has several great things about it. Kajol and Ajay Devgan, a real-life couple, give two good performances, and their chemistry is obviously good as it has always been. Ajay, in a different role, is cool, mature and convincing. Aactually, as a director, he does a relatively impressive debut as well, and he rightly makes his talented wife the centre of attention here. Yeh, and it is our Kajol, who is natural and compelling. I liked the entire concept of Alzheimer and predicted a typical emotionally temperamental film. Happily, it didn't go over-the-top. But sadly, I somehow lost it and didn't see the point of the film. Maybe I should re-watch it." 
" A very well-done film on a very serious subject","From the way this movie began, I had no idea where it was heading. There was a certain silliness in the opening, but its really a bait and switch situation. In fact, for some time, you are really baffled by what is going on. Ajay is telling a story, and from the way the story is visualized, you have a lot of reason to assume he is telling his own story, even though he doesn't present it that way. Until you get through most of the way into the story, you have no choice but to follow the story as if it is a parable or something.Then comes the big crunch, the rainy scene where the whole mood completely changes. But still the story-teller keeps his hole card out of sight.When the true nature of what is going on becomes evident, you realize the story is one of the most frightening anyone can imagine, and only then do you really appreciate the quality of the acting.So, I think I've seen Ajay Devgan's best movies. And I'm pretty sure I've seen Kajol at her best. And I've liked every movie since their marriage, whether comical or serious, where they played the lead roles. But I'm pretty convinced this is, at least, Ajay's best. And somewhere near Kajol's best. I hope one or both gets at least a nomination in next year's award round." 
" U me aur hum, the revolution of bollywood has started!!! Beautiful!","U me aur hum is a classic in my eyes. The film did average business commercially. But I think 90% of whoever has seen the film loved the film out and out. U me aur hum, sure it has something that the Notebook also has. The film is about alzheimer's in love. That CERTAINLY Doesn't MEAN THAT "U ME AUR HUM" IS A REMAKE OF THE NOTEBOOK!!Everything is optimal in this movie, be it direction-wise, performance-wise, art-wise, song-wise, casting-wise! I always thought Ajay Devgan is very very underrated. Hopefully this movie will change his careerline! Gosh what a storyteller, the way he pours emotions in his characters, the way he uses the camera, the way he has chosen the locations. Everything exceeds! U me aur hum is Ajay's finest work as an actor, and of course a VERY powerful debut as a director. Kajol is perfect! She shares 1000% awesome chemistry with Ajay. Both her and Ajays performances sometimes make your eyes water.Songs are excellent! Be it Dil Dhakda, Jee le, Phatte, Saaiyaan or the U me aur hum tracks. Beautiful. This film is truly a masterpiece! Way to go ajay!" 
" Together-together","Ajay Devgan's U, Me Aur Hum is an imperfect film. It will never be taught in a film school. Intellectually, you can make a laundry list of the flaws in the film. Cynics will like to point out the similarities between this and some Hollywood films like The Notebook, Iris and Away From Her - all films involving Alzheimer's and memory loss. There are some who have even pointed out that Devgan should have done a scene-by-scene copy instead of a thematic one. I wish you had a magnetic cynic-o-meter at the theaters for these cynics so they would not be allowed to watch the film. U, Me Aur Hum is the realization of Devgan's belief in his film and his conviction in telling a story his way. It is an emotional film and in that sense a very good film. It works because the drama is genuine and Ajay and Kajole are seasoned performers who have great chemistry. There are some who say that Ajay and Kajole have gotten old. Those people are not only cynical but superficial as well. Such people should perhaps invest their money in a copy of Maxim or FHM instead of this film. To the passionate independent filmmaker U, Me Aur Hum would be very inspiring. Devgan has put everything into a story he believed and then put a team of people together who may or may not be the who's who in Bollywood, but who are nevertheless talented. These people have obviously bought into Devgan's vision and what has translated on screen is very genuine, very from-the-heart and very moving. Co-writer Robin Bhatt, co-producer Kumar Mangat, cinematographer Aseem Bajaj, composer Vishal Bharadwaj, supporting cast Sachin Khedekar, Divya Dutta and gang are all to be applauded for their efforts. Special mention to new lyricist Munna Dhiman - seems like another Prasoon Joshi in the making. Aamir Khan and Ajay Devgan - apart from being actor-director-producers - have something else in common: they have always been original in their thinking and tread their own path. They are superstars aspiring to be and remain artists. The coming years in Bollywood are going to be very exciting. The size of the film will not be based on budget or star power, but ideas and heart. Ajay Devgan will also have his part to play in these new 'big' films." 
" Excellent!!!","I must say I have been a fan of Kajol for years but I only recently have been a fan of Ajay's. This guy is awesome as a actor and am sorry to have found him so late. I am amazed by some of his past performances. Getting back to the movie.I loved this movie. It is excellent. One of the best Bollywood movies that I have seen in long time. I am dying to get the DVD. Finally a mature Bollywood movie with a good plot and good acting and nice cinematography. I was not bored at all through out the movie. First of all it seems a lot shorter than the other Bollywood movies I have seen. It's not 5 hrs but 2 1/2 hrs. The Ajay and Kajol jodi is awesome together. I know it been a long time since this Jodi has worked but they are beautiful with each other. i would classify in the league of SRK and Kajol and Aamir and Kajol. They look real good like they belong to each other. The chemistry is smoking hot. You can see that there is a lot of love and comfort between them and finally it shows on scene. Watch this movie for the performances,the direction and the story. It is hard to believe that it is Devgan's first direction. Ajay Devgan is really good at making romantic movies although I was surprised because I don't think of him in romantic roles. If this is his first direction than he is very gifted. It is beautifully shot. This movie has everything. Both AD and Kajol truly deserve all the awards including the national award for their acting. Kajol has never looked more beautiful. Kajol is the only one of the current Bollywood actress that could play this role. She really gets in the skin of characters that she plays. Ajay also was truly amazing in his role. This guys really has the midas touch. These two are Bollywood's best actors by far. Ajay is as good as Aamir and maybe better. I think this guys is good at any role he plays. Although he is not the typical pretty boy, he is really attractive and you fall in love with his charm. The story is excellent. There were several memoriable scenes that you were left with. It is both a powerful and gripping. The first half was funny and entertaining. The second half is when the movies really made it for me. I think what works is Ajay's intention that people leave with the right message. I appreciate what he has done. You leaving contemplating life and the issues that surround you. You will need lots of tissues in the second half. I think that if you are married or in a relationship you will appreciate this movie a lot more than if you are single. Finally a movie that brings families together than separating them. I thought the music was very nice and it goes very well with the scenes. I was singing the theme song for days. The costumes were also very nice. I want to get my hands on some of them. I was also surprised by the humor in the first half. My only objections is that it was not shot in the beautiful European towns like other Bollywood movies and the dancing limited. I guess I should expect the dancing limitation since the Devgan doesn't having the great dancer reputation.If you have to catch one movie this year it is U ME AUR HUM.. It deserves that national award and should sweep the all awards. It is Hollywood caliber.My rating is excellent. Must watch..You will not be disappointed." 
" A Forgettable Movie About Forgetting","These days in Bollywood, handicap (whether mental or physical) seems to be the trend. Even the popular 'Om Shanti Om' parodies this. After 'Black', 'Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Maara', 'Fanaa', 'Taare Zameen Par', 'Naina' etc, we have 'U, Me Aur Hum' and the only film that stands out is 'Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Maara' followed by 'Taare Zameen Par' to an extent. So what's wrong with 'U, Me Aur Hum'? Well, there's too many wrongs in this one.The screenplay is inconsistent, imbalanced and exaggerated. The writing is just so bad that some of the dialogues make one cringe. The Ajay-Piya before-marriage love story is both unconvincing and uninteresting thanks to the terrible writing. The scenes on the ship are boring. It does remind one of 'Mann' (a movie which I liked except for the ripoff part) but the Ajay-Kajol chemistry does not match up to what Aamir and Manisha had (in addition 'Mann' had some very good dialogues). Most of the jokes and 'one-liners' fail to make an impression. While in the post-interval portion when one would expect things to get better as the story takes a drastic turn, things are too exaggerated.The camera-work is both overused and misused. Why were scenes being shot from a strange angle? The close-ups were irritating as they were pointlessly in-your-face. The CGI is terrible AND it is excessively overdone. The songs are forgettable. Most of them are better forgotten. The salsa sequence is terrible (the horrendous cinematography does not help here) and some of the backup dancers were laughable.As a director Ajay Devgan fails to put it all together. He should have hired a better writer and written something better himself (since he's credited as writer). His film looks very messy. As an actor he's average. Watch Jim Broadbent in 'Iris' to see an amazing performance and compare that to Ajay's (both are similar roles). Kajol too gives an inconsistent performance which is overall average. It does not rank among her best. The supporting cast don't leave a mark. Isha Shervani is there to say a sentence or two and to remind us of how flexible she is. Divya Dutta hams in the beginning but is gradually okay.Devgan may have had good intentions and in some scenes it is apparent that he really tried to do well. Acting and directing is a tough task and only few talented people manage to pull that off. Sadly that isn't the case for Mr. Devgan. And why is it that in most (if not all) Hindi films, healthcare institutes are shown as this cold indifferent lonely place? Yes, support from family and friends is important but sometimes people do need to be admitted to institutes where they can be taken better care of because what others provide is really not enough." 
" "a must see" with your someone special..just U, HE/SHE aur ROMANCE..","1).Superb cinematography2).fantastic graphics3).Gorgeous Kajol 4). Awesome performances by all cast 5). Nice title track. If u sum all these what will u get?..U, ME aur HUM. I have to admit that it takes guts to choose such a sensitive subject for ur first directorial venture bt HATS OFF TO AJAY DEVGAN for bring us "old wine in new bottle". This movie is SOooo Romantic that u wil surely going to miss ur someone special so if he/she is not with you. I wil not reveal it's storyline but also is not new subject but the presentation or the way in which the story told is what it's strong point. "a must see" with ur someone special..8/10" 
" U, Me Aur Gham","By the look of the promos the film looked like a beautiful love story but it's not. U, Me Aur Hum is either the daftest or the worst love story I have ever seen. The setting is a poor rip off of Titanic and the story is 200 years old that has been tackled a Zillion times in Bollywood. Ajay Devgan tried to make a Bollywood Titanic but he wasn't even 1% close. Other than that the film was so boring that I had a sore head & I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. The movie is almost 3 hours but it felt like 3 years. It just does not make you laugh and cry.The story was supposed to be about being positive. People fall in love and then they say certain things when something is not working out - it's only because they don't want to work things out or are not making an effort to work things out. The movie is trying to say that no problem in life is bigger than any one person, so you have to decide to be happy, to sort it out with a smile on your face. How you look at problems. You see the problems will pass by and life will go on and in the end of it you realise it was a beautiful life. The humour from life should not go away in a problem that humour and laughter will eventually heal you and that's how life goes on. But it was Ajay Devgan's inexperience that ruined everything.The main problem is the screenplay (which is the story put onto screen), it constantly jumps from one scene to another in less 5 seconds and it's too difficult to follow the story. If it sticks to one scene then it is 15 minutes long although it could have been made in less than 5 minutes. I hated the film right from start to end.Ajay Devgan is a good actor but he is an absolute rubbish director and he should just concentrate on acting. He must have pulled the script from his bum and Kajol was probably chasing him with a rolling pin and he snatched the rolling pin from her. So that's how Ajay demanded Kajol to do this garbage, junk and crap film.Music is good composed by the talented Vishal Bharadwaj (who also composed the music for Omkara & No Smoking). The best songs are Jee Le and Dil Dhakda Hai. But what is the use of good songs in a bad film, that too, if you have someone like Kajol who dances with two left feet?Overall U, Me Aur Hum is so far the worst film of 2008 and I'm more likely to see pigs flying than a worse movie coming out than this. The ending was so predictable that you didn't even have to be of average intelligence to figure it out." 
" Is based on 2004 release The Notebook directed by Nick Cassavetes","Ten minutes through the movie I was able to see where it was going and thought "that's my money and most importantly time down the drain".Frankly, the movie is a pain to watch...torture through and through; if you have seen The Notebook...PLEASE FOR HEAVENS SAKE STAY AWAY FROM THIS! I am disappointed! It can't outclass The Notebook for various reasons. Just because you change the settings and make this whole thing full of glam does not mean its different...bottom line...its not marriage/friendship but the movie is about managing someone you love with Alzheimer's, period.My advice don't waste your time...grab The Notebook on DVD and see what real movie should be like.The Devgans think they can get away with nything...what a SHAME! Wake up people!!" 
" A Great Love Story....","What a movie Ajay has made!! Absolutely great marvelous...... It was Without any doubt an amazing job fulfilled by him just like his fellow Amir khan,both jumped in the field of direction and gave the industry a New hope.although it is a remake of Hollywood movie THE NOTEBOOK.But such a great story deserves to be in bollywood not only in bollywood i would say in each and every film making industry because love remains love everywhere,everything else changes.As i realized this is a unique kind of movie based on love,no villains No more family problems bla bla bla......... This movie just circles Around the relationship between a husband and his wife ,the Relationship which started from love and ended with love,love was the Thing which kept them strong even in worse situations.I would like to say this movie is a good tool for bringing back your Girlfriend if she is going away,a rather easy method to add a spark to Your diminishing love life.only thing you have to do is you have to Take her to the theater anyhow.and then i am sure she will be yours so Hurry this offer is valid for a limited period." 
" Great performances, beautiful story (minor spoilers ahead)","Rating: 4/5!!! Very much recommended!!! I have to say I truly applaud Ajay Devgan's directorial debut. There were moments of great truth and brilliance, and I really appreciated what I felt was a very smart use of symbolic images (watch it and you'll understand).It's truly a remarkable story. I think Mr. Devgan has a talent for story telling. And his cinematographic eye is remarkable. I think he truly understands that a story in film can be (should be?) narrated through images, acting AND words, in an effective combination of the three (MINOR SPOILER here: I loved the juxtaposition of images and dialog on the cruise when Ajay tells Piya about his watch. I felt it was very effective).Very few times I've felt that a character is as real as Ajay, and I really have to say I was very moved by his characterization of a true, flawed and brave human being. My only comments that could be read as a constructive critique, are very minor. One, the quotes at the beginning are somewhat hard to read as the letters come "flying" to their respective positions in the sentence. Also, they deter the viewer's attention from the initial credits (I'd like my name to be read if I'd been part of the crew!) All in all, I loved the film for its beautiful story, use of words, images, acting, music. Kajol as always manages to take us to unimaginable heights through her performance, and you create the perfect platform for her to do so, while embodying perfectly what human love is all about." 
" Good To Watch","All I had seen of this movie was a lot of promos and nothing much else. But I was rather surprised with the content of this movie and was very pleased to see one of my favourite actresses, Kajol, back on the screen.Ajay goes on a cruise with a couple of friends where he meets Pia, a waitress and for him its love at first sight but for Pia, she follows her heart and watches Ajay, who is a Physchiatrist, make a fool of himself by getting drunk. The next day, she has the pleasure of handing him a massive bill to pay for. However, everything goes well and the two get married until one day, Pia tells Ajay that she can't remember much.Starring Ajay Devgan, Kajol, Divya Dutta, Vishesh Didwani and Robin Bhatt, this is a good debut for the "Top Gun," Ajay Devgan for his directorial debut. He has done a good job of it and more so as he has highlighted a disease - Alzheimers, which is affecting countless people in this world. Not even the late President Ronald Regan, of the United States, where, as well as in the other countries, a lot of money has been spent on research, could be saved from this. Kajol's acting, and not just because she is one of my favourite actresses, is good, but because she has managed to carry her part extremely well. The romantic part, is not for Ajay Devgan. Its may be because I am use to watching him in action roles. But I felt it was not for him and may be it should have been handed over to the likes of Shah Rukh. And what was most annoying was the amount of times the character kept on saying: "You know..." I am sorry but if this was in an examination, the writer would have failed for repeating countless times - I lost count completely. In fact the last count I remember was 12.Also, the first half could have been shortened a bit and some scenes could have been edited as they were making the first half a bit dragging. There were moments, where I felt like going to sleep or doing something else.U, Me Aur Hum is definitely a movie that is one of the best that have been released so far this year. The credit for a good directional debut is definitely for Ajay Devgan and this is a movie that is good to watch." 
" Nice Try but Not Good Enough","After watching it's trailer everyday, my wife concluded that this movie is a MUST WATCH thing, but after the movie my wife (first time in her life) admitted that it was a mistake to come to this one.When I started watching this movie, I lost my interest in it very soon. I think watching this movie in theater atmosphere is a painful experience. I must admit that acting was fine and some moments were catching, but nothing that can make it any interesting.I wish I could write something in favour of this movie, but there is nothing I can think of. Sorry guys, I'm not recommending this one, almost 3 hour of run time will feel like the life sentence in jail." 
" U me aur hum rocks and just leave you speechless.","I just can believe it, the movie is superb. Very sensitive, touching. Ajay as a director and actor did very well, superb. And Kajol with this performance just proved how talented she is. Her scenes are so touching, you really believe it, the role isn't easy to play and she did it very well, in each scene i was speechless. The other couples are great too. It's very an interesting movie, really. And now i wanna see the movie again and again. Great,well done, good direction from Ajay, Kajol's performance i just think that there are no word in the dictionary to describe it, it was so mind blowing. Ajay's performance is good and touching. The music is really good, each songs. GREAT MOVIE. 9/10"
