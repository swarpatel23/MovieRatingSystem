" SPOILER Excellent film! Following might be a SPOILER","Julie is a fascinating film that explores the journey of a girl who went from sweet innocence to the harsh reality. All of her relationships, aspirations, and determined efforts are very well depicted. The audience can completely understand how a small-town girl, who lives with her lovable father and pet dog, leading a beautiful life ends up a prostitute in the unwelcoming city of Mumbai as her dreams are repeatedly shattered, as her lovers continue to exploit her. Left desperate with no one to retreat to, Julie is brainwashed/enlightened by the local pimp, who gives a very thought-provoking monologue. She asks, "Who is Julie?" She can avenge her traitors, but she will eventually end up with a feeling of helplessness. Julie is told that all men want from a woman is their body, whether it is through prostitution or the excuse of marriage or raising a family. (I beg to differ.) Julie finally realizes that she does not want to depend on others to give her a face; she needs to create her own identity. This monologue, the climax, and when Julie re-confronts her first lover are mind blowing scenes. Julie's bold move to tell her entire life story on national television in an effort to revolutionize society is extremely interesting. Her emotions are very well-illustrated. Songs are worthless, except for the title track, and detract from the story. This is a must-see movie." 
" Half baked","In 2004 post MURDER there was lot of hype and influx of sex related films, JULIE poster showed Neha's bare back to gain publicity,Neha Dhupia had just debutted in QAYAMAT where she had a small role and her voice was dubbed. JULIE is directed by Deepak Shivdasani, who gave us films like BAAGHI(1990), he tried to make a comeback with this film. The film starts off with Julie shown as a prostitute and predictabily goes through a flashback, however the film has lot of flaws First and foremost the reason Neha Dhupia chooses to be a prostitute doesn't register, also the reason of her to expose her truth front of national TV is far from convincing, the film has some good scenes like Sanjay and her relationship or her meeting with Yash Tonk in a hotel but overall it faltersDirection is decent but the writing spoils the show, in keeping with his trademark style, instead of INTERVAL his name comes as a director like in his previous films Music is decentNeha Dhupia tries hard but doesn't convince, her dubbing too by someone else looks odd, this was her second film and she looks too wooden Sanjay Kapoor though reminds of his brother Anil Kapoor, gives a decent performance, Yash Tonk too is good, Priyanshu is superb the rest are all okay" 
" Wonderful Storyline","Julie is a wonderful storytelling, and you are going to enjoy her journey. It is all about a woman's struggle in the industry and her rise and sorrows, the beautiful Raai Laxmi (Julie) is a naive and simple girl with ambitions and talent. She makes it big in the South and then Bollywood. She encounters bad men, the underworld and also some good people. The narration is simply superb and the pace is just right. Overall, Raai Laxmi is brilliant; she carries the film on her shoulders and the girl seem to have potential. Director (Deepak Shivdasani) has done a decent job; he has pegged the film as an erotica; however, there is much more depth. First half of the movie is better than the second half due to well- balanced content; however, the film could have been tighter in the second half. Having said that, one can still continue enjoying brilliant performance and good cinematography. Music is melodious (typical 70s and 80s types). Music is one of the biggest strengths of the film. All the tracks have been composed beautifully and according to the moment that the script demanded. Last but not the least, apart from the songs, superb background score was the biggest plus of the movie especially in the second half.Conclusion: Highly recommended to all the cine goers especially if you care for women-centric films." 
" Best performance of neha","There was lot of hype and influx of sex related films, JULIE poster showed Neha's bare back and it showed what the film was all about.At the beginning of the movie there is an intimate scene in a gray which gives glimpses of neha dhupias sexiness.There are couple of scenes where her acting looks mere but when it comes to the maincourse she shines.The sensual song Julie is perfect and she shed almost all her inhibitions in the song.It was a bold song and it included a scene where she is topless and sheds her garments. In 2004 post MURDER there was lot of hype and influx of sex related films, JULIE poster showed Neha's bare back to gain publicity,Neha Dhupia had just debutted in QAYAMAT where she had a small role and her voice was dubbed.

" Smoldering Hot Neha Dhupia Skin Flick!","OK, let me start by saying that the film delivers on every count it is publicized to deliver---- there is a smoking hot heroine in the form of Neha Dhupia, she has a killer body, displays enough flesh to render this movie almost soft pornographic, there are some seriously deep and passionate lip locks and smooches, and the music is pretty pleasant to the ears. Neha is young and has a well toned, curvaceous body that stays in your imagination long after the movie is over, if you know what I mean. The story is basically a remake of countless "Pretty Woman" type movies, but watch it solely for Neha's smoldering body ad sex appeal!Also, the songs and the bikini number are worth the price of the ticket."
