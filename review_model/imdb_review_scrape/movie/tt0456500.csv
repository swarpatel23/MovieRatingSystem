" Hilarious sex comedy!","Here comes India's first super-hit sex comedy with good reason! This movie is absolutely hilarious. The guy who came up with this movie is one creative (and perverted!) genius. This comedy of errors and mistaken identities sure has some interesting situations. From Anupam Kher's "Three Balls Theory" to accidentally following in love with the wrong gender, this movie has it all. Isha Koppikar was amazing. She has always been a versatile actress and, in my opinion, the only one in Bollywood who hasn't been categorized. However, I came to realize that after watching this movie where she plays a seductress and a buff police officer who's always eating pan. Neha Dhupia, unsurprisingly, looked great and gave a good performance. Even Tusshar and Riteish did a good job. Songs are really cool. The best one undoubtedly is "Dil Mera" featuring the giants of Indian remixes! Oh, and you might be more comfortable watching this movie with your friends rather than your parents!" 
" Koppikar rocks!","Isha Koppikar is definitely the star of this entertaining, although somewhat of an inconsistent sex comedy. I had no idea the "Khallas" girl from Company had it in her to give such a detailed and nuanced performance. She is THE character from the very first scene. Dominated every scene she was a part of. Absolutely loved that Bihari accent in which she spoke. Overall, an extremely likable performance to say the least.Ritesh Deshmukh is a natural at comedy. Not as funny here as he was in Masti, but still gets the job done. Tusshar fairs much better when he doesn't have to be funny. Anupam IMO was a disappointment. I don't know if it was his lines or just the way he delivered em'....but didn't generate many laughs. Everybody else did a fair job.The sex jokes were hilarious at times, but quite the opposite when they became overly vulgar. I hope nobody makes the mistake of watching this movie with their parents. Stick to ur friends or watch it alone.There's little logic in K2H2. Heck, there isn't even a plot that u can summarize since the movie is all over the place......but I wouldn't consider it a drawback since its funny enough to keep ur attention throughout. Overall, definitely worth a dekho for the comedy and of course, Isha Koppikar." 
" Kya Kool Hain Hum..... Indeed","Okay.... A late entry I guess, but better late than never, or, "I may be a slow walker, but I never walk backwards."So someone didn't like this movie, so someone doesn't have any sense of humor, so someone has lost taste to comedy movies. I guess this is the same person who likes Hollywood type of adult comedy but not "Bollywood" style!!! Strange!!!I agree that you can't watch this movie with your family, sister, mother, etc etc.... but did you watch movies like American Pie with them??This is superb comedy & timing based movie directed by Sangeeth Sivan!These two dudes, Reitesh & Tusshar are longing for girlfriends & fun. No one of them had luck & Reitesh mostly bluffs about his affairs & "one night stands" which is more than hilarious.Even Tusshar has done his piece (for a change) of dumbo-role which suits him perfectly.....If you've a sense of humor, you must watch it, but remember, not to be watched with your family... Only with friends...." 
" Another one of those " Pleasantly surprised " flicks and trend setter in Indian sex comedies","i went into this movie thinking ill see another on of those ekta kapoors and saas-bahu sagas and a lame attempt at humour boy was i surprised what issued was a laugh a minute comedy about all things sexual including a scene with a mannequin that left me thanking god my parents were not around what also surprised me was the ability of the film makers to laugh at themselves and others without being offensive the use of names specially ishaas was lovely all in all a good movie if you like this kind of sex teen comedies that has alluded India for so long not for everyone but if you looking for some stupid senseless fun then this movie is for you" 
" great adult comedy","Watch it. Laugh your guts out! Everything about the movie was cool! sparkling lines, fabulous acting, good songs, wonderful gags.. what more should one ask for in a comedy..people who think its vulgar, should get their rockers checked!! It was said to be a sex comedy and it is just that... so if u r prudish and do not want to see anything related to sex at all, don't go...but i assure u that if u do go, u will laugh a great deal! One thing that really impressed me was the casting. I think every small role has been casted well. The creative team should be given credit, for there were many sequences that could have crossed the limits, but they balanced it very well albeit on knifes edge! The success of the movie has proved that the audience in India has evolved. How i wish i could say the same for the critics!!!" 
" wow","Its a movie where you can forget about everything else and enjoy....Its funny as hell....If you are looking for a serious movie...don't watch it....if you are in for a fun ride....go for it...The characters are very funny..and the movie is very different from other comedy movies....It is also not a entire family entertainment as it is an adult comedy...Sometimes it does gets vulgar.....The actors have done a good job enacting those scenes...BEWARE: Thinking about some of the jokes after the movie may still bring a smile on your face. The songs are OK...but the movie could have been made without any songs. For once there is no violence, or gory details, it is a pure but not very clean comedy. Its better than the other movies where there is dancing in the rain and romancing around the trees, villainous characters and other blah blah." 
" One of the best Hindi comedy films of all time","After the release of Masti, Bollywood has spawned many other raunchy comedies, but the sad part is they all involve extra marital affairs and are basically just clones of Masti. But then comes a film like Kyaa Kool Hai Hum, completely original, completely daring, and completely hilarious! A great script and a great cast that includes Tushaar Kapoor, Neha Dhupia, Isha Kopikaar, Riteish Deshmukh, Anil Kapoor and others. The whole story is just one big misunderstanding after another and includes some of the greatest comedic moments I've seen from any film, Bollywood or not. This film is great, and in my opinion was one of the best of 2005. Filmfare, IIFA, and ZEE Cine always overlook well scripted comedies, this film should of at least been nominated for the Best Film category, for it was not a rip-off of an Anne Bancroft classic(Black) neither was it an homage to one of the best Hollywood films ever made(Sarkar). Clearly a must see movie, I highly recommend it." 
" Unbelievably funny!","When life sucks you become weary with trying to make the best of things. It so happens, I was in that very situation when I rented Kya Kool Hai Hum. A friend said it's a movie that will make me laugh and feel better. Well, she was right: I howled with laughter! KKHH is funny, sick, dirty, crazy... Tushar and Riteish are a great pair and reminded me of other classic comic pairs such as Salman-Aamir (Andaz Apna Apna) and Ajay-Aamir (Ishq). This movie comes with fantastic twists and turns and just makes you feel sorry for the characters for having such bad luck... Isha K. does an excellent job in portraying a feminist cop (especially when she wants to blow T's brain off in the beginning). Neha D. does a good job as well. Anupam Kher made me laugh just as hard as the other two and so does his co-actor. Being a psych major in university, I can safely say, we're not all like that...lol. Raj Yadav delivers his classic comic style and adds to the grand theme well. All in all, this movie is a good watch (not suitable to watch with slightly stringent parents...lol) especially to take away the blues!" 
" Turning Point in Ritiesh's career","Ritiesh Deshmukh started his career with Tujhe Meri Kasam(2003) followed by Out of Control which didn't get him much attention but post MASTI he got noticed though it was a multistarrer and it worked. Kya Kool Hai Hum took his career much further, It also benefited Tusshar who was getting flops, Even Ekta Kapoor got her first hit in films as a producer The film was famous for it's sexiest jokes and adult comedy It has several funny moments but Ekta also had to uplift her brother's career hence gave him extra mileage which does get irritating at times and makes the film stretched especially in second half. Also some scenes are not too funny while things do go too far especially in the climax when the real killer surfaces.Direction by Sangeeth Sivan is good Music is goodRitiesh Deshmukh is amazing in his role, he was awkward in his first 2 films but post MASTI he became more natural and he got even more relaxed and camera friendly in this film Tusshar is good in his role however he does get irritating at times Isha Koppikar is superb in her role and won laurels, Neha Dhupia is okay Anupam Kher is hilarious in his role, Shoma Anand is good too Razzak Khan is funny, Rajpal Yadav irritates, Avtar Gill is good rest are okay" 
" One of the most awful movie of 2005","KKHH is a story about two useless losers in life Karan (Ritesh) and Rahul(Tusshar Kapoor) who are worst at what they do best.There is a serial killer on the loose in the streets of Bombay who rapes his victims and then kills them.THe Police starts believing that Rahul is the wicked murderer in the mean time in his quest to marry a rich and beautiful girl Karan gets stuck in a different confusion.The plot seems fine and there is enough of confusion and situations to make audience roll on the floor.But this is where the "Genious" Ekta Kapoor and Sangeeth Sivan jumps in and creates a trash which can only be watched by people who don't know what good comedy really.THe film is full of cheap double meaning jokes which are so awful even college guys can't withstand them.The scenes involving Ritesh and the cats and the one with the dummies are some of the worst moments on Indian silver screen.Performance wise the movie is horrible.Each and every actor(except Isha Kopikar) adds more junk to this crap.The director was trying to show Ritesh as the "Cool Dude" but by wearing good outfits of UMM no one can become cool dialogs delivery of Ritesh is so plain and feeling less it makes you wonder how this guy is in the film industry.Tusshar Kapoor is as bad as ever after Gayab this is yet another performance which leave his future only in his sister's movies because i have serious doubts about him casted by any other director.Isha Kopikar's role and performance is like the only exceptions her dialogs delivery is inch perfect.Her getup , walking style and everything is perfectly executed by her and clearly shows the home work and hard work what she did for this role.Neha Dhupia had no (absolutely nothing) in the movie.The music is good I m sure many tea stalls in UP and Bihar would be playing CHaska round the clock . The tittle track can be a hit in college students.OVERALL a complete idiotic and pathetic movie. 1/10" 
" The summer is definitely Kool with KKHH!","Plot Outline: Buddies Rahul (Tusshar Kapoor) and Karan (Ritesh Deshmukh) are wannabe cool guys who accidentally get involved in a comedy of errors involving a search for a serial killer. Things get funnier with criminologist (Anupam Kher), cop Urmila Martodkar (Isha Koppikar) and Rekha (Neha Dhupia) adding to the comic progression of events.Comment: The creative and comical KKHH is a welcome break from the recent thrillers and 'inspired' lifts of Hollywood hits. Tusshar looks like he has woken up from his bad stint in Gayab. Ritesh does much better than in Masti. Isha character is well scripted and she did a great job. The well scripted chain of events surely keeps you glued to the seat and leaves you asking for more.KKHH is definitely better than peers Masti & Hulchul and can be considered on par with Hungama. The dialogues, cinematography and costumes are apt. Songs aren't really worth discussing about. Certain comedy sequences are crude and maybe unsuitable for family/kids. On the whole, KKHH is "Laughter Assured".Rating: 3.5/5" 
" kya fool hain hum","kya fool hain hum ? this is what every viewer should be asking from the makers of this disgraceful, highly regressive, z class film which sadly became a hit in India. It is so pathetic that it makes you wonder if this is the kind of stuff required to make people laugh in the future ?Bad films should not be reviewed or analyzed but this one is a classic case where from acting to script to direction to almost every Dept. sunk to the limits. the only thing that this film has is jokes centering around that one body part of male and female, and the respect it showed towards it is amazing. It is not just lack of brains but also a lack of sensibility and morality by everybody involved in the making of such mindless effort. The film evokes sheer disgust." 
" The storyline such as it exists is nothing but an excuse for toilet jokes, the kind that even immature college kids don't crack.","Just a crappy movie featuring gutter-level 'comedy' of the 'American Pie' variety. Like 'Pie', this movie will appeal to the so-called hep crowd -- and their numbers seem to be growing as India rapidly becomes an intellectual colony of the West -- which has to work really hard at appearing 'kool' and so guffaws at crass American 'humour' while sneering at the home-grown Dada Kondkes and Johnny Levers as 'crude' and 'forced'. Another proof, as if it were needed after all these centuries, that there is no stagnation in human affairs and if there is no continuous effort to improve standards they are certain to deteriorate." 
" Kyaa Hilarious Hai Isha","'Kyaa Kool Hai Hum' starts off a little slow and dull and many of the jokes fall flat. But once Koppikar's Urmila Martodkar is introduced, it becomes a laugh riot all the way. The story is pretty silly but as long as the humour works, there's plenty to laugh about. Speaking of humour, it's full of sexual innuendos but nothing too sleazy nor overtly vulgar. Anupam Kher, Shoma Anand and Bobby Darling are hilarious. They can easily get the viewer to laugh. Riteish Deshmukh is good while Tushar Kapoor is almost passable (in spite of the poor dialogue delivery). Neha Dhupia is likable and sizzling. However, it's Isha Koppikar who steals the show. She's the one who draws loud laughter from the viewer and it's hard to stop. She'd already shown a knack for comedy in 'Ek Se Badhkar Ek' but 'Kyaa Kool Hai Hum' further showcases that ability. This is one funny film and I'll say have a little patience in the beginning and bare with it because what's to come is pure laughter." 
" Kya Kool Hain Hum?.............NO!!!","i shudder just to think of it .............On that fateful night as i entered the cinema hall like an innocent lamb about to be butchered , i realized my worst fears.To this day those faces haunt me, Tushar kapoor springing out of the void alongside the constipated ritesh deshmukh, frightening though their presence undoubtedly is, this fact is somehow amplified as enter damsels(ahem!) 'who' distress - Isha Koppikar and (whats her name again?) - Neha Dhupia. Unfortunately or fortunately i don't seem to be able 2 recall the other characters for there i sat mesmerized by the proceedings(not going into details). And about the storyline, ill tell when i figure it out. To the film and all those who liked it, GET A LIFE!!!. What has the world come to? How can anyone in their right mind think this could pass as a comedy. If anyone thinks otherwise, i strongly suggest that they seek professional help from any reasonably sound doctor.In a nutshell, its the most unimaginative, uninspiring, disastrous piece of bull you can lay your eyes on, but I suspect it wont be lonely at the bottom with movies like Jo bole so nihal, rok sako to rok lo and others to keep it company." 
" The worst rip-off ever","I am a lover of Roberto Benigni's 'Il mostro' and this movie steals most of that movies gags and jokes almost scene-by scene. Which is a good thing because it made me love the original more and more. This movie is an insult to the viewer's intelligence. The annoying sounds after every "joke" the 2 dimensional, un-likable characters, the terrible direction, kills all the entertainment this movie would ever provide. It has none of the humane touch Benigni's work has. It is sadistic, terribly boring and just plain bad. Avoid it. It is a waste of time."
