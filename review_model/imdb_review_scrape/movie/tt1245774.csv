" One Of The Top 10 Movies Of 2009 !!","Yesterday when I went to see this movie , I didn't expect a lot ; but what I got was a spectacular vision of the true life inside the jail. Very satisfied and much mire than my expectations. The performances by all the actors were good ; a very strong performance by Neil Nitin Mukesh. Moreover a very strong and powerful script. Jail delves into the darker side of reality , the reality what lies within the walls of a prison. Even today there are many people who have still not yet been found guilty are facing the grim reality of the life inside the prison wall; which Jail brings to light. Excellent,Transcendent and Highly Distinguished cinema. One of the top 10 movies of 2009." 
" Madhur and Neil score!","I know Madhur Bandharkar movies don't interest the masses, since his movies are realistic as hell. His last outing, Fashion, was on the contrary a bit different, but still Madhurs style. Because I really liked I checked out Jail, and im not disappointed at all! Jail has great performances by Neil Nitin Mukesh, Manoj Bajpai and the other supporting cast as the inmates. The music is in sync with the movie and the screenplay and cinematography has been done in an excellent way.I feel Jail could have done better business instead of bombing at the box office if it only didn't release aside the comic raper Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani.Jail has Neils best performance so far, a nice story and great content! Go for it!" 
" Hard-Hitting & Moving...","Accomplished Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar returns with a yet another Hard-Hitting & Moving experience in his latest offering 'Jail'. A film that shows a 'Jail' & it's 'Inmates' like never before. An Icredible Attempt.'Jail' is a winner all the way, a film that is not only a gripping tale, but also, a film that you take home. After you watch 'Jail', one thing is for sure, and that is that you'll never want to attempt a crime or even dream about it in your nightmares. A criminal is a criminal, he needs to punished,,, no doubts on that. But there some people that are kept in those torture-cells, while some are proved not guilty or one's trial has not begun. A film that raises god knows how many questions, & seeks for answers. Well, god knows weather will they be ever answered or not! In the acting department, Neil Nitin Mukesh steals the show with an Icredible performance. He's exemplary in the role of a wrongly-accused inmate. Manoj Bajpai is, as always, good. Mugdha Godse plays her part with honesty. Arya Babbar is excellent in a brief role. Others lend able support.'Jail' is an eye-opener, a film that might have bombed at the box office, but this dark & gripping tale is sure to achieve a cult following in the coming years. Strongly Reccmended!" 
" Neil's best performance so far !","It may not be a hit in BO but it is one of those few films which stays in your heart forever. Neil Nitin Mukesh is amazing in this movie. The movie rests on the strong shoulders of Neil Nitin. He has excelled in his performance.Parag Manohar Dixit (Neil Nitin Mukesh) is a successful executive, living with a roommate who is a bit of a weirdo — his mobile phone always seems to have a poor network whenever the guy is in town, and he constantly uses Parag's phone. Parag's air-hostess girlfriend, Manasi (Mugdha Godse), warns him against the weirdness, but Parag laughs it off, saying that such things (he even uses Parag's underwear and towel occasionally) are normal with bachelors.But it's not so simple: one evening, Parag picks up his roommate from a pub and the cops get after them. His friend opens fire on the cops and is critically wounded by the police, and drugs worth over a crore are found in the vehicle.The world goes upside down for Parag: he is remanded in police custody; a greedy lawyer sucks money from his mother (Navni Parihar) and girlfriend like a leech drawing blood; and once incarcerated, he gets to stay in conditions and an environment that he never had imagined before. His roommate lapses into coma and soon dies — and with him, seemingly, Parag's acquittal on a serious drugs charge seems a remote possibility, especially as many bail applications are rejected.The long battle begins and soon, Parag is broken, shattered, a programmed automaton who suddenly gets into frenzies and vicious temper bouts. The inmates in jail all have one common thread: hope, irrespective or whether rich or poor, innocent or guilty, law-abiding or lawless and sentenced or awaiting trial. And Parag will never be the same again, but life-term convict Nawab (Manoj Bajpayee) would want him to be the same man when he goes out a free man and not get embittered or even lured by in-jail mafia that operate along with corrupt cops, represented by Karim (Aarya Babbar) and his clique.Some people say that the scenes in jail and the atmosphere created by Madhur Bhandarkar is very claustrophobic but that's how it should be ! There was no scope of music in this kind of movie but the songs are very intelligently woven in the film, My fav are Data sun le & Milke youn laga. As a whole it is a must watch film !" 
" The "Slice & Dice" of life in a jail","In life some moments end up obtaining the status sacrosanct. No matter how hard one attempts, they cannot be relived and any attempt to recreate the magical moments go futile. The same would applies to Madhur's "Page 3". In hindsight it serves the purpose of being an yardstick, a guiding light force, a benchmark simply to aspire but never surpass. "Page 3" created a genre which signified a fine balance of ingredients of parallel cinema doused with commercial sensibilities. Madhur's subsequent outings were attempts to fit into this genre but his every passing milestone were getting over-weighed by commercial temptations. "Corporate" and "Traffic Signal" to a certain extent carried the soul of "Page 3" but with "Fashion" it was transparent that the voice of "Page 3" was silenced and in his recent outing "Jail" the voice has perhaps died of extreme suffocation. "The Green Mile", "Teen Deewarien" and "The Shawshank Redemption" are the thought that would spring into the mind as you watch "Jail" especially the latter with Manoj Bajpai reprising the role of Morgan Freeman. Indeed the stark reality, the rustic look and nexus is portrayed with utmost perfection. Sadly the plot fails to bear the weight and the seams begin to give away with each passing reel. Performance wise, everybody is spot-on. Its difficult to segregate between the actors and the actual inmates. ˚ Niel: Gets a role of his life-time to showcase his talent in full glory. Sadly, as mentioned earlier the writing fails. Commendable is his commitment to get into the character and thereby gets an authentic look. And yes, the way his character gets implicated warranted better writing. ˚ Mughda: Seemed her character was more of glam-doll. And quite cinematic for her to stand up to the protagonist right from first frame.˚ Manoj: The character did not have much meat in it therefore he appears to akin to a goat peering his eyes into the camera.˚ Arya Babbar: Leaves an impression.˚ Navni Parihar: Except to stand next to Mughda, her character served no purpose (probably pre-meditated the "Saas-Bahu" equation well in advance!)˚ Atul Kulkarni: Very small role.Whilst the "Page 3" ending was a realistic ending, the wrap-up of "Jail" is so commercial (on the same note even "Fashion" was)." 
" Such an underdog of a movie...","The premise of this film is one that the average individual must have seen once of twice in their lifetime (in the wildest dreams/nightmares). Mr A and Mr B are traveling along when suddenly they are stopped by the police. Mr A (a law abiding citizen who just got promoted at work and is engaged to his girlfriend another happy-go-lucky individual) is instructed by Mr B (his shady room-mate) to outrun the cops but when they are caught, Mr B tries to make a run for it and is shot leaving Mr A at the mercy of the police who soon find a stash of illegal drugs in the vehicle. This is the sort of thing that everybody prays never happens to them. I kept having the feeling that this was 'Ek Haseena Thi' with a male protagonist but as the movie progressed I saw that while it had shades of the afore mentioned film then again it was so much more. The movie carries the message of false imprisonment and illegal conduct that takes place in India (I can't remember the exact statistic but it was something like 70%-80% of inmates in Indian jails are either men or women taking the fall for someone else or still awaiting trial for a crime that they have yet to be convicted of). Neil Nitin Mukesh proves once again with this one that he is not only an actor, he is a serious one. Mugha Godse seemed disinterested in her role and it showed but not enough to take away from the film." 
" Too dark & predictable to be liked by all.","Madhur Bhandarkar is one of those rare talented directors who has mastered the art of making movies out of the newspapers. Continuing his series of films based on real life instances, he strikes again with a dark, uninviting and somehow upsetting movie on an unconventional subject of Jail and the life of its inmates.Before going into further details, one thing you have to keep in mind before watching "Jail" is that it's not the usual witty and gossipy kind of subject chosen by Madhur this time. As suggested by the title itself, the theme is more cruel, dark and depressing which is also in complete contrast to Madhur's previous famous films. It is even more harsh than his "Traffic Signal" having no room for any comic, humor or sex references. So if you have opted for the movie looking for some great entertaining stuff then you are definitely sitting in the wrong theater.But at the same time "Jail" is also not at par with Bhandarkar's earlier highly appreciated works. For the first time he has opted for a completely predictable and seen before kind of script which has not got any shock treatment for which Madhur is more famous for. The story is anybody's guess where a young boy is wrongly framed under a drug case and has to spend a few painful years in Jail for a crime which he had never committed. Now the problem here is that the miserable ambiance of Jail and the life in it has been already shown in many movies before. The grouping system in the convicts, usual fights between the inmates, the use of money for their personal comforts and the underworld operating from the jail, everything has been there on the screen umpteen times before Madhur's elaborate movie on the subject. So there is nothing new in store for the viewer, which usually is the first expectation from a Madhur Bhandarkar project. And that's where "Jail" fails to deliver to a great extent.However, the director's excellence is still evident in a few well conceived sequences related with some important characters in the script. Especially the sub-plots of Manoj Bajpayi (Nawab) & Rahul Singh (Ghani Bhai) are brilliantly handled by Madhur in his famous trade mark style (But I found no justification in Nawab killing his own kid brother without any reason). Madhur even explains the relationship between Monsoons and Jails in a very impressive manner. Besides this the narration showcases the questionable process of law and the greedy lawyers operating freely in this corrupt ongoing system. In addition to the above, the director also incorporates the real life inspiration angle in the movie taking references from the famous BMW Hit & Run case, Cricket bookies now found in every city and the hidden truth of homosexuality in the Jails. Apart from his much applauded direction, the other department in which Madhur has got a great understanding or instinct is the Casting. He is simply perfect in his choice of actors for a particular role. For instance Neil Nitin Mukesh as the main protagonist, Manoj Bajpai as Nawab, Rahul Singh as Ghani, Arya Babbar as the influential inmate, Mughda Ghodse as the helpful lover & Atul Kulkarni as the savior lawyer, every one suits to their respective roles so perfectly. Undoubtedly the best act comes from Neil as the innocent helpless boy, followed by Manoj Bajapai giving a worth watching performance as per his reputation. Neil impresses with his superb expressions depicting the solitude and sufferings faced by his lonely character. On the other hand, Manoj speaks more through his effective stares and exceptional body language. The climax is the best part of the film which has got the Bhandarkar power in it but I think the movie could have been a bit shorter by few minutes to make it a more engrossing watch.The script has got no scope for any full length songs. Still there are few quick numbers added into the story which actually don't serve any particular purpose. The compositions are not melodious enough to get register and even the Lata Mangeshkar prayer track is not able to move you either emotionally or musically. But the realistic set of prison and cinematography both deserve a prasing mention for their remarkable contribution.On the whole, "Jail" is too realistic and gloomy to be liked by everyone. Moreover the repetitive and predictable content of the movie will prove to be its main drawback at the box office. It is thought provoking for sure but not after you have left the theater.Yet there is one moral lesson I concluded from the movie which I would like to share with you all. It gave me the precious insight that.."CRIME is the unwanted and illegitimate child of ANGER and we should always take care of the precautions before it gets conceived" - bobbysing" 
" Great","It's a great movie, it deserves at least 7/10.........................." 
" The larger picture is terrifying","I am a fan of Madhur Bhandarkar's brand of realistic films but somehow never managed to see Jail until today - on TV.Jail is a sordid story that needs to be repeatedly told to remind us of the larger picture of thousands of undertrials (and even convicts in some cases) languishing in prison for years on end. Many of these people could even be innocent. A case in point is the news this week of the man who was kept behind bars for 23 years and now completely acquitted. Shocking and horrifying are not adequate descriptions.The sets, costumes etc are realistic though undoubtedly sanitised. Cinematography is superb as is the acting. Neil Nitin Mukesh does a brilliant job as an innocent who is barely managing to cope with his incarceration. Manoj Bajpai and everyone else are also excellent in their roles.Though in this case there is a happy ending in that Neil is acquitted, the larger picture is that people are languishing in Indian prisons for years on end, facing untold horrors apart from the loss of liberty, who should not be there in the first place.I do not know why Jail did not do well at the box office. Some critics say it is due to Ajab Prem ki Ghazab Kahani releasing at the same time. Jail surely deserved a better run. Do watch the DVD or when it runs on TV." 
" An intelligent script and direction - a must watch","Considering most of the Bollywood films with imaginary stories, songs as well as dance sequences in the gardens, I was pretty much reluctant for this movie. But happened to see it on TV. Really impressive work, later found out the director is Madhur Bhandarkar, no doubt there are really very few directors to create such kind of magic.Very real and strong script, with superb direction. The movie progresses stage by stage with a charm. It was such a treat to watch this movie. Loved every part of it and the best part is touching one of the most sensitive areas in India. Never had so much sympathy for Indian jail convicts so far. This is for sure a movie of international standards.A must watch." 
" Bhandarkar rules Bollywood once again","Madhur Bhandarkars movies are completely different from the senseless bollywood movies we have become use to. This person has the courage and guts to bring life to film making in India. I feel sorry for the people who have failed to appreciate his art. Neil Nitin Mukesh has made a tough but correct decision in his career as an actor, there are greater things in life than making a lot of money with zero effort and Niel has proved his worth as a true artist. Manoj Bajpai is one of the greatest in this industry and jail is another great piece of his work. i would recommend this movie to every one as it is an eye opener to the cruelty which innocent people have been facing in the sub continent for decades. Britain has a great legal system, Pakistan and India follow the same law but apparently have become a lost cause. Rating: 5/5" 
" Shades of Gray","Madhu Bhandarkar in this movie brings out some remarkable characters and one of them is Kabir. Shown as the pawn of a Baba Bhai, a mean character with overbearing friendliness. He turns to help the protagonist just to have him recruited in the Mafia. There is another character of Ghalib who pleads money from another inmate for his mother's operation and uses it to bribe his way to freedom. This movie is full of such characters who are good and bad at the same time.The movie begin slowly and picks up pace later, you almost feel bored with the predictable turn of events initially, only when the jail life begins to settle in the real plot unfolds. Also the later part in which the protagonist is released is probably added to soothe the moviegoer. The fees of a lawyer were probably hugely padded with 75K of one hearing for a lower court is unheard off." 
" Jail Is Just Plain OK","Madhur Bhandarkar is getting too repetitive and as a result, Jail turned out to be a drag.Bhandarkar's banal way of storytelling has lost its appeal and originality. Consequently, Jail is boring, tediously slow, extremely clichéd (the bane of our movies) and way too predictable. The story doesn't need an elaboration, but the situation Neil Nitish Mukesh's character finds himself in isn't one that garners sympathy. You feel sorry for him because he is falsely accused, but the cops don't know that and they gotta investigate. Only he and his roommate (who goes into a comma) know that the drugs found in his car weren't his. But it was his car; hence, he is an offender. So his having to go to prison makes sense. You don't feel the kind of sympathy for him that the director wants you to feel. Life in prison is shown at its worst, but then being in prison is supposed to suck. What was ironic was showing inmates getting together to pray to God. OK, we have killed a few people but now please get us out of this hellhole so that we can be nice for a week and then start killing again. Performance-wise, Neil Nitish Mukesh (all three of them ;-)) is very good. His previous films have proved that he is a good actor, and Jail vindicates that. The dude if felt sorry for was Manoj Bajapayee. It was totally sad to see him in a single-expression side role, although it's good to see that he's back in the movies at least. Mughda Godse is unglamorous for a change but doesn't get enough screen time to show her acting prowess. The other characters are the usual bunch of Bhandarkar's real-life-type actors. Overall, you won't miss anything if you don't go for Jail." 
" Out Of Jeffrey Archer, On The Big Screen","With Jail, Madhur Bhandarkar continues his take on reality. This time, he looks behind the closed bars of a jail to look at the stories that reside there.Parag Dixit (Neil Nitin Mukesh), a financial whiz- makes money by the plenty and lives life to the fullest with his air-hostess girlfriend Mansi (Mugdha Godse) in tow. Unfortunately for him, his roommate turns out to be a drug peddler and operates without his knowledge. The police catch Neil and accuse him of co-conspiring with his roommate, who lies in an ICU, in a coma.Falling prey to the notoriously slow judicial system, Parag ends up in jail, still pending trial. How he handles this new environment, and the stories of other individuals that inhabit the world behind bars, makes up the crux of the story.The basic premise of 'Jail' is one that can be claimed to have been lifted from a Jeffrey Archer novel, or the countless masala movies that are churned out of Bollywood every year. Where it differs is in the portrayal of the jail, forever consigned to be fairly open cells housing 1-2 prisoners, 'Jail' shows them for being what they really are. But unlike some of his earlier ventures, the exposes and the inside look ends there. There is nothing new that Madhur uncovers here: the underworld, the wrongfully-in-jail characters, the politicians holding court have all been seen before. Another problem is that the characters are too stereotypical. The good boy, the bhai's henchman, the gay couple seem out of a story and not real life. And that is where 'Jail' falters.Madhur Bhandarkar is known for his brilliant direction that keeps us motivated to sit through potentially depressing themes and stories. While this is his least depressing venture till date, he fails to deliver the same brilliant speed and sense as always.Neil Nitin Mukesh does a good job of portraying Parag, the man who is wrongfully incarcerated. It takes an immensely brave man to take up a role which is so challenging in nature. He's on screen for more than 90% of the screen time, going through so many different emotions, and also the much-talked about nude scene. He makes Parag believable. Kudos to Neil.Mugdha Godse gets very less scope as Mansi, but manages to do a decent job. Manoj Bajpayee as Parag's sympathizing co-inmate is the narrator of the movie, but somehow gets only a perennially sad expression to work with. He manages to still pitch in a good performance. His performance in the flashback sequence is his high point. This has to be expected though, with the film showcasing and focusing on Neil throughout.The music in 'Jail' is simply there to make up the numbers. Even the legendary Lata Mangeshkar's 'Daata Sun Le', though rendered as well as her songs are, could have been done without. 'Bareily ke Bazar mein' is absolutely useless placement wise and is only just bearable in terms of song quality.Kalpesh Bhandarkar captures the jail well on screen, giving the viewer as if he's looking at a sea of humanity and brings home the gruesomeness of the jail. Nitin Desai should bag the award for the best art direction unless a Sawariya or Devdas like set comes up in the movies coming up in the next month. The jail is incredibly well etched out, right down to the wall carvings.Final Verdict: Overall, Jail is only slightly above average. Watch it on the big screen only if you must. Wait for a TV release in my opinion." 
" Jail is very predictable","Despite its grim setting, director Madhur Bhandarkar's Jail is his least cynical film in years. Neil Nitin Mukesh stars as Parag Dixit, an innocent man implicated for a crime he didn't commit. Much of the film is centered around Parag's frustration and helplessness as he struggles to stay sane and alive amidst hardened criminals. Like the director's earlier films, Corporate, Traffic Signal and Fashion, his latest too is a slice-of-life drama about the characters and the way of life within the world he's chosen to set the film in. This time though, Bhandarkar ditches his trademark exposé approach and settles for an emotionally-manipulative tone instead. The script of Jail packs in every cliché you expect to see - distraught family struggling to raise money to pay lawyer's fees, jailer venting about his thankless job and meager salary, even a hit-and-run accused who gets off easily because of his influential connections. But despite the clunky writing, it's a relief to see Bhandarkar empathasise with his characters rather than exploit them for cheap titillation like he's done in earlier films. In a very simplistic and roundabout fashion, Jail is about hope and making the right choice, but the film is too formulaic to make a hard-hitting statement. Of the cast, Neil Nitin Mukesh plunges sincerely into the central role, but is at best adequate as the anguished victim. Mughda Godse is unselfconscious as Parag's distressed girlfriend, but has very little to do in a stereotypical part. Arya Babbar plays it broad and is convincing as the top aide of an underworld fixer, but the same sadly can't be said for poor Manoj Bajpai who glowers and glares as Nawab, Parag's only ally in prison. Bajpai's solemn turn adds to the dreariness, making Jail too long and too slow in the end. Because it's well-intentioned and settles for a hopeful message, you stay with the film despite the fact that it's never quite compelling.It's got its heart in the right place, but sometimes that's not enough." 
" "Behind Bars but not Beyond Justice"","If any one can depict a "bewildered" "why-me?" look, that would be clearly-Neil Nitin Mukesh as Parag Dixit. The look is familiar since his Debut in "New York". He takes the look further with some depth and dexterity under the baton of Madhur Bhandarkar. The other good actor is Arya Babbar-as Kabir. The look he gives when Parag tells him, that he could kill, is fine piece of acting. Mughda Godse's who made her Debut in "Page 3", as Parag's fiancé has acting skills akin to Konkana Sen Sharma, with buxom expressive eyes. The movie has a thriller quality to it with sub-plots that keep you on the edge. Manoj Bajpai as Nawab, comes across like a Halloween scary character on the surface appears to have a devious agenda but he is one character that the viewer will have most sympathy for-even though he is in for a serious crime. He also has the best diction for narration in fact he should have narrated the whole movie as Morgan Freeman did in "Shashank Redemption". The movie has few similarities to "Shashank Redemption" but the similarities are more generic since the theme is a Jail irrespective of the geography. Madhur Bhandarkar has a flair for showing the raw-edge of the society, where as the other film makers would shun away from. He is one of the best self made "Casting Agent" in India. He would never hire meat-head actors like Salman Khan, Aamir Khan who have absolutely nothing to offer to the Indian Cinema.Bhandarkar,invariably has a deep message ("behind bars but not beyond justice") as in "Traffic Signal", "Chandini Bar" "Satta" and other fine movies. I am sure he has other "Themes" in the pipeline that would wake up the Society from Slumber. Suffice to say, I have become a devote fan of this director-more so after this movie."
