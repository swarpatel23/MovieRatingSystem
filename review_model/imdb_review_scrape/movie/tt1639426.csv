" When dreams give you the ability to fly","Udaan must be one of the best Hindi films I've ever seen - realistic, simple, engaging, riveting, inspiring and deeply moving. Vikramaditya Motwane's direction deserves the highest of praise, and the script, written by Motwane and the great Anurag Kashyap, is superbly written. The film looks authentic and is easy to relate to and yet it has an impressive larger-than-life quality to it that makes wonders. This poignant story is brought out exceedingly well on-screen, and the depiction of the subject matter is brutally honest, at times disturbing and excruciating and yet totally encouraging. Made with sheer graciousness and sincerity, Udaan perfectly captures the adolescent days of a young teenager named Rohan, and it follows his dreams, desires and growing maturity.After being in a boarding school for 8 years, Rohan is expelled and is forced to return to Jamshedpur to live with his terribly authoritarian father and a younger half-brother about whose existence he never knew. The story follows Rohan's life with his domineering father, who maltreats him and disapproves of his dreams to become a writer by forcing him to study engineering and work at his steel factory, by treating him like a recruit, by abusing him physically and emotionally, and by scorning his writing skills. But life there actually causes Rohan to mature. His pain inspires him to write and he gradually grows to love his poor and helpless young brother Arjun, who, orphaned from his mother, equally yet quietly bears the brunt of his father's cruelty and is intimidated into silence by his despotism.Udaan is about chasing your dreams and living your life as fully as possible despite everything. It, in a sense, celebrates the power of the human spirit, showing us that we can fly very high and fulfill our most impossible dreams if we only believe in ourselves and summon up the courage to fight for our happiness. All that is presented through the character of Rohan, which is incredibly well written. He is smart, talented, compassionate and he does not spend time feeling sorry for himself for having a true monster of a father. On the contrary, it gives him the strength to create and write more, never letting his father's attempts to morally abuse him into submission deter him, lose his sense of life or stop writing. That's what makes this movie so spirit lifting.The narrative style is exemplary. The movie is amazingly realistic and intense and while some may say it is a bit slow in pace, according to me it's thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Not even once does it lose its consistency and integrity. Every scene is brilliantly shot and directed and is important to the film's proceedings. The portrayal of relationships is also aptly done here. Rohan's friendship with his schoolmates is portrayed exceptionally, despite the minimal screen time it's given. You just feel it's always there. Where its technical aspects go, Mahendra Shetty's cinematography is fantastic and so is Dipika Kalra's effective editing. Amit Trivedi's music is absolutely spot on for this movie. The songs bring the film to life and are truly uplifting and fun.The acting is roundly excellent by one and all. Even the tiniest roles look believable and genuine and they greatly contribute to the film. Rajat Barmecha debuts in this movie in a role that young aspiring actors can only dream of. He is one of the most promising actors of the current breed of fresh talents and although he clearly is going to have a great career, this is probably the role he will be most remembered for. He acts with complete understanding of the character, making it very convincing and relatable by naturally displaying Rohan's anguish, vulnerability and compassion, and later on his coming-of-age, courage and determination to do it his way.Ronit Roy is excellent as the merciless father. He manages to be as hateful as possible, yet at times he shows sparks of regret and humanity, which may be very few and barely noticeable to some, but are enough to understand that it is his own weakness and struggle that made him act as he did. Ram Kapoor in a relatively small part leaves a mark as the kind uncle of the kids, who is the complete opposite of his hot-blooded brother. The same can be said about Manjot Singh, who makes his second film appearance after a memorable performance in Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!. His ten-minute role here as Rohan's best friend is so likable and well-played that you feel like having watched him there throughout the entire movie. The film's brightest spot is undoubtedly Aayan Boradia. He is simply outstanding as Arjun and is easily one of the cutest kids in recent movies. This is a strikingly convincing portrayal; he smiles very few times throughout and conveys so much of his loneliness and pain through his innocent eyes and touching silence, without ever overdoing it. His quiet suffering and heartbreakingly accepting attitude of growing without a mother and without the care of a loving parent, on top of that having a merciless and violent father instead, make you really feel for him. It's almost impossible to believe anyone could harm such a poor creature. This is according to me one of the finest performances by a child actor, up there with the unforgettable Jugal Hansraj of Masoom.Udaan does not work because of what it 'has' but more because of what it 'is', and that's why it's so great. The ending is extraordinary, and it brings forth the long-awaited catharsis. The climactic sprinting scene is a triumph on its own - exhilaratingly exciting and hauntingly memorable. A magnificent song called "Aazaadiyan" perfectly concludes this terrific story, effectively presenting the film's ultimate 'udaan' (flight). Udaan is an ineffable cinematic experience and to put it simply, the best Indian film I've seen in years. Truly one gem of a movie." 
" Lots of soul in the movie","You might find the poster of the movie a bit misleading – because the poster and the trailer of the movie seem to suggest that it is college- teen story. And Udaan is anything but that. It is, however, a intensely heartfelt movie with a strong emotional connect – and with so much realism, that I cant shake the feeling it is, to a large extent, autobiographical. Even though it is populated with largely unknown faces, set in a bleak industrial city, yet this movie will linger in your minds for a long time after you exit the hall.The plot of the movie is essentially a two liner. A 17 year old is kicked out of boarding school for playing truant and is forced back to an apathetic father – and to a 6 year old half brother he didn't know existed. Stuck in a small town with no friends, forced to study engineering and work in his father's iron and steel works, Udaan is a story of Rohan's struggle with his loneliness and desperation. It is not pure entertainment, but it has got a lot of soulThe overbearing character in the movie is Bhairav Singh, played by Ronit Roy. A despotic father (with some probable army background, though its never suggested) – who does not listen to any opinion that doesn't match his own and runs his life with army-like discipline. He even insists his sons call him Sir. He stands starkly in contrast with his younger brother, the affable Ram Kapoor. He is the only beacon of light in Rohan's new world.And amongst them, sitting quietly in a corner is his younger brother Arjun – who doesn't speak much, yet wins your heart. Everything from the background music to the photography is perfect for the movie – Amit Trivedi's music melodious yet not distracting from the movie and the bleak shots of Jamshedpur accentuating the void that Rohan feels around him. Udaan is a coming-of-age movie that you will identify with because of its honesty and sincerity. Newcomer Rajat Barmecha delivers one of the most subtle, yet effective roles in sometime – putting up a stoic face against the circumstances, yet showing us the vulnerable teenager within. The movie takes a slow pace, which in my opinion is essential for the viewers to share Rohan's desperation – but some of my friends thought otherwise. That is probably the only slight flaw in this fabulous movie. Highly recommendedYou can read more reviews at http://bombaycinephile.blogspot.com" 
" This Udaan will fly high....","Udaan First time director Vikramaditya Motwane has done a brilliant job with Udaan. This film was truly worthy of a screening at Cannes. The simplicity of this movie is probably what makes this movie wonderful. Its a story which is not too uncommon in India, but the way its been shown, is what brings the freshness in the film.Rohan(Rajat Barmecha) has just been rusticated from his boarding school along with his 3 friends for they were caught watching an adult film of sorts(Kanti Shah ke Angoor) by their dean. As it turns out, Rohan has to go back to his home in the small industrial town of Jamshedpur, To add to his woes we find out that he hasn't met his father(Ronit Roy as Bhairav) in 8 years and he doesn't even know of the existence of a step-brother(Aayan Boradia as Arjun) at his home. Reaching there he learns that he has to work with his father at his factory and enroll in engineering college. And the disciplinarian his father is, he can't even question him. As he is stuck there with his dream of becoming a writer seemingly getting shattered, he learns to cope with life. He learns to love his kid step-brother, manages to write between work and college, sneaks out for a drink or two at night, but inspite of all this, he is getting suffocated. He wants to escape. He wants to fly.Udaan is a simple, emotional story about a boy in a small town, learning to live with his disciplinarian of a father. It is actually as simple as that. It might not sound interesting like this but the fact is that the way this normal coming of age story has been showed is just brilliant. There is nothing 'bollywood' about this film, its as if this movie was shot with a handy-cam, capturing the lives of a real family. But that doesn't make this one bit boring, because obviously there are some exaggerations, some gags, some drama but all in all its very real and believable. I'm sure everyone one of us would be able to relate to this film in some way or the other.The high point of the movie is the performances by the leading men(there are hardly any women in this film). Ronit Roy as a single father has done his job with perfection. He drinks, smokes, but still goes for a jog every morning, which also turns out to be a very important aspect in the story. He sometimes loses his cool, uses force in teaching his kids a lesson, but at times we also see that he is caring and probably a little vulnerable. He's acted so well, that you can feel it when he is drunk, you even get scared when he is angry, that good is his screen presence. I was wrong to write off this TV actor. Rajat Barmecha too has done an impeccable job in portraying a kid, who has lived his life in one of the best boarding schools of India and now is stuck in a small town. He does the usual, sneaks out at night for drinks and smoke, steals his fathers cars for doing so, but still makes it on time in the morning for his daily run with his dad. His writings are beautiful too, so credit must go to the original writer as well. But the award must go to Aayan Boradia who is one of the best child actors I have ever come across in Indian cinema. He is so real, so cute and you will just fall in love with him. He is somewhat aware of what is going on but obviously at his age he just can;t do anything about it as his understanding does not go that deep. And then lastly Ram Kapoor as Jimmy, Bhairav's younger brother brings a very good contrast between his authoritarian brother and his practical chilled out of sorts character. He understands Rohan's dreams and aspirations but he can only do so much to convince his big brother to change his mind. A very intriguing relationship between the two brothers I must say.Running time of over 2 hours, this might at times seem a little slow, but you gradually understand the importance of those long silent shots as the film progresses to its climax. There are scenes that will send chills down your spine. There scenes that will inspire you to 'fly out of a cage' if you are in one, metaphorically speaking of course. Its just filled with those moments that will be with you for sometime to come. It won't be easy to forget this movie soon. And let me assure you, you will come out highly satisfied after watching this movie. A big thumbs up for Motwane! Looking forward for more! Cheers to all the actors as well!" 
" A rare Hindi Movie","Ohh Yeah ! It is that good. It is one of the couples of Hindi movies that has managed to move me. Very simple yet heavy on its contents.After seeing it on many Best of 2010 list, I had to see it. And after watching it has to review it. This very ordinary story stays with you even after hours of watching it. "Udaan" is a story of a boy, who like everyone else dreams and like almost everyone else he had to decided and step up to the hurdle before him. It is also a story of a father who like many tries his best to brought up two kids but fails. Its characters are not heroes or villains.The performances are pitch perfect. Ronit Roy does it so amazingly that you wonder if his talents were wasted on television. Both kids are so refreshing. The biggest achievement of the film was that you just don't pity the father but kind of understand his actions. it is a journey that will make you run for your dreams and love ones. Do not miss this fantastic piece of arts." 
" One Of The Finest Films of 2010!","Vikramaditya Motwane's 'Udaan' is a film, that lingers your memory, and gives you the hope to live your dreams. The film has everything going for it, it has a touching story, proficient performances, hummable music & striking direction. It's A Winner All The Way! Rajat Barmecha stars as Rohan, who, after being abandoned for eight straight years in boarding school, returns to the industrial city of Jamshedpur and finds himself closeted with an authoritarian father and a younger half brother who he didn't even know existed.'Udaan' is an inspiring story. Screenplay by Motwane & Anurag Kashyap is brilliant. Their protagonist, is not a passive one, he has a goal, that of becoming a writer, which has been stabbed by his authoritarian father.

" A movie you should never miss","It is one of the BEST movies Bollywood has delivered in years. The story is excellent. After being abandoned for eight years in boarding school, Rohan returns to the small industrial town of Jamshedpur and finds himself closeted with an authoritarian father and a younger half brother who he didn't even know existed. Forced to work in his father's steel factory and study engineering against his wishes, he strives to forge his own life.His only oasis is his uncle, who supports him to pursue his dream of being a writer.Debutant director Vikramaditya Motwane starts with a bang.Ronit Roy is fantastic. His acting as a tough father really makes the heart bit slow. Young Aayan Boradia is at his best. Ram Kapoor and Rajat Barmecha are equally good. Music is also good and it is a pity that this movie is not promoted well. It has covered all the issues related to teenagers and above all it touches the heart of the youth. Sometime you will feel that your life is mingling with the life of Rohan.And when the movie ends, it leaves an impact for long time.If you have not seen this, certainly you are missing an exceptional movie" 
" Udaan a must watch..","Udaan is simply a heart-warming tale..very good storytelling,particularly immensely engaging in the 2nd half,gr8 acting(the child actors has been a revelation)...and above all superb music..Vikramadiya motwane in his debut film has produced a stunner. Motwane and anurag kashyap's storytelling technique,as always has been impressive. The film has its own moments,particularly the evolution of the relationship between the brothers. The songs are also well placed. The Director carefully brings out the intricacies of teen age mind..Rohit and Aayan,both the actors has been above the mark...The story too ends on a high note..and to be mentioned...Ronit roy was a treat to watch...Above all this was is a must watch...very few films of this genre are made in Bollywood.this is certainly one of the best of them..I am giving it 10 on 10..P.S.-Was shocked as well as pained to see the cold response of viewers in the theatre..Perhaps for this only such films are scarce in bollywood." 
" A brilliantly told story of hope, love and chasing your dreams","With "Udaan", director Vikramditya Motwane has proved that he is here to stay and be the 'change' that we are all desperately seeking. "Udaan" is so brilliantly written, directed and acted that it just mesmerizes you with its story telling. Rohan's journey after being expelled from boarding school in the city of Jamshedpur working under his tyrant father and the way his character evolves simply touches your heart. Little bit of one liners shared between Rohan and his friends stay with you. Rohan's younger step brother is absolutely fabulous and even if he spoke barely few dialogues in the movie, he made an impact by his sly little demeanors. Character of ultra strict father played by Ronit Roy is so well crafted and acted that it is very much believable. To top it all, amazing music from Amit Trivedi gels so well into the movie that it lifts the spirits up by tons. At the end, kudos to the whole team for delivering such a lovely work." 
" Just Go And Grab Your Seat","Film: 'Udaan'; Director: Vikramaditya Motwane; Cast: Rajat Barmecha, Ronit Roy, Aayan Boradia, Ram Kapoor; Rating: **********This movie is definitely a very good offering from Indian Cinema. Movie deals with a ordinary issue with very sincere treatment.The movie should get accolades almost in every part,right from technicalities to performances. Direction (from Vikramaditya ,who finally got a production house after five years of a long wait)is very strong and clear,thus made his movie to be screened at Festival De Cannes.The movie contains very strong performances from the lead actors.Rajat Barmecha as a young boy did a superb act,and so does Ronit Roy(as his father) and Ram Kapoor(as his uncle). Music from Amit Trivedi complements the happenings and has a fresh feel. I will recommend this movie for serious audience who are greedy of something real and brilliant as this." 
" An insightful and must watch take on adolescence with a hidden message.","Adolescence is one of those rare subjects on which we haven't witnessed many movies made in Bollywood. Therefore UDAAN comes as a pleasant surprise from a debutant director Vikramaditya Motwane, who boldly makes his first movie on an important subject and delivers a fine polished product proving his unique thought process with a style.First of all the film is not preachy as it may seem to be from its look and promos. It's a simple story of a young boy and his relationship with his rigid father and helpless younger step brother told in the most simplistic way. But as it is said, 'The beauty lies in its simplicity', UDAAN becomes worth watching because it's truthfully simple without any added flavors or colors.It starts superbly with its first 20 minutes depicting the mischievous days of 4 young friends living in a boarding school. The sequence of their running from the school to watch an adult movie in the night show sets the mood in for the viewers. But this particular section of the film indisputably belongs to Manjot Singh alone (the young Lucky from 'Oye Lucky Lucky Oye"), as he clearly outshines everyone on the screen with his famous realistic dialogue delivery style and comic persona. After its funny half an hour, UDAAN takes a serious turn and then moves into a completely different shell talking about the difficulties faced by a young boy while interacting with his ruler kind of a father. At this stage the narration becomes serious and the pace slows down drastically. But very soon you find yourself involved in this little family of three men living in the same house as strangers.In every family, a young male child always has his own contradictions with his father. There is difference of opinion, difference of vision and most probably the fight is over the issue of the stream or line in which the child desires to make a career in. UDAAN rightly focuses on this relevant issue and therefore every young boy watching the movie would easily relate to the script and the characters in a big way.The movie may not find a thumbs up from every section of the viewers as its basically meant for the fans of realistic cinema who are used to a slower pace and can appreciate the social subject of the script. It also has some minor flaws in its charactersiation like, how can a child steal money and car from his father who has a reign of fear in the family and yet cannot revolt right away. But even after these minor glitches, it still remains a well crafted film standing out of all those usual projects offered to us in 2010.In real terms there are few visible and one invisible aspect of "UDAAN", which makes it a worth watching project.The visible aspects mainly include the outstanding confrontation sequences between the father and the son about their different styles of living and choice of professions. Both Rajat Barmecha as the young boy and Ronit Roy as the father truly excel in their scenes together. Then just watch out for the young kid Aayan Boradia, playing the silent step son, who mutely keeps suffering the merciless beatings of his father and doesn't utter a word. He is simply adorable and loving with his innocent smile and dialogues. And then there are two sparkling performances by Ram Kapoor and Manjot Singh. Especially the silent conversation scenes between Ram and Rajat are a treat to watch. Finally the most impactful visible aspect of the movie remains its climax where Rajat along with his writer Anurag Kashyap and director Motwane defines the meaning of their title "UDAAN" in an exceptional way. In fact the concluding scene of the movie is capable of lifting up every viewer from his seat in sheer joy.Coming to the invisible but in my opinion the most important aspect of "UDAAN", which puts it in a completely different league, is the way it expresses the need of A MOTHER in every child's life. The film makes you feel the incomparable role of a female or a mother in a family who cannot be replaced by any amount of love, compassion or care provided by the other members. A mother, who can finish off all the differences in a family with her kind presence, love and calmness. A mother, who in disguise is just GOD living in our homes for taking care of us in the needy times. And a Mother whose debt we cannot repay in any form in our whole life on this planet.Both the director and the writer need to be congratulated on this hidden aspect of the movie which may not strike all the viewers at first. But if you can think for a moment, then all the sufferings in the movie are only there due to the missing factor in the family called "MOTHER".So, in a way "UDAAN" also makes you realize this Biggest Gift of God to the mankind by very softly portraying the fact that a family becomes completely dry and stiff in absence of a motherly abode. I hope the film encourages every son or daughter to remember that they are blessed to have their mothers around them in this tender age and they do take care and love her to the best of their abilities forever. Summing up, its a recommended flick since it has an important message for all fathers and families having their kids in the adolescence age. And indeed a must watch for its invisible merit, indicating the role of a Mother in a happy family.(The movie right away moves into my "Movies To See Before You Die" list cause it makes you realize the most precious gift of God to us and that's our Mother.)" 
" Abusive father, idealistic son, and complex modern India middle class...","Udaan (2010)On the main level this is a gripping, realistic, deeply moving story of a sensitive boy with an abusive father growing up in a culturally complex India. This is the main point here, and the reason to see it. The leading part played by this boy, Rohan, is a magnificent acting debut for Rajat Barmecha. He was twenty playing a seventeen year old schoolboy, but he's convincing, and nuanced, with both great emotional vulnerability and flashes of rebellion and fire. The other level to consider from this movie is as a cultural lens. I write from the U.S. and know only what I see from here, but it seems like a coming of age movie with the tinges of generation gap and young rebellion seen blossoming (in the movies and in life) here in the 1960s and 70s. Rohan's father is "old school" in that he's tough on his son, thinking the son needs discipline and hard work to grow up and be functional. The boy though is a writer at heart (there are several scenes where he recites poems or tells stories and they are spellbinding, if brief), and the father won't hear of that. Raising Rohan without a mother seems to give him so leniency for his stubbornness, but not for his violence, and Rohan, somehow, must react.The third character of note is not a girl--a nice change from many young men growing up stories--but a little half-brother who Rohan ends up befriend and ultimately kind of mentoring. The little one is super cute and delicate, and the three males with all their problems and conflicts make for a rich, intense interplay.The other cultural aspect (besides how young people might be seeing their morality shift from their parents and grandparents) for an outsider is to see contemporary India in a rather true, ordinary way. I mean, "Slumdog Millionaire" was amazing and sensational in its own way, but it pushed buttons and pushed boundaries. This movies stays within boundaries to that being edgy isn't interfering with the reality of the story and all its successive stages. It's really great stuff overall. The one thing that will seem odd, maybe, to some is the inspirational feel-good music with lyrics written for the film. It's almost saccharine it's so idealistic, but then, it's probably when every struggling 16 year old in Mumbai or New Delhi or wherever needs to hear. That part of the movie is not for an outsider at all, which is okay. I think people see the American classic "The Graduate" and have similar problems with the coming of age problems being mid-1960s in flavor, and the music having a pretty tenor not always up a contemporary alley.So see Udaan for what it is. Rooted in expert and conventional filmmaking and storytelling, but powerful stuff." 
" you will not notice the absence of a female lead in the movie.","This movie is like a definition of 'quality cinema'. strong storyline. great acting. immaculate direction. powerful dialogues. and guess what.....you didn't even get to know when this movie was released and was already off the screens before you could read a review in the papers. but that is the most amazing part....these kind of movies are not driven by the commercial success.. the refreshing, new and inspirational soundtrack ensures that you have something to remind you of those amazing moments within the movie.someone like me whose life can easily be considered to be that of a king as compared to that of the protagonist of the story, who has to wait till night on each day to take his first meaningful breath of the day, can not really relate to the story line....but as it progresses you find yourself living each second of his life with him, such is the depiction of the story in the movie, that you are bound to feel the realistic-ism. you find yourself scared when he is doing something without telling his father, you find yourself whispering...do not do this dude, you will get a great beating. you find yourself almost in tears when the father bundles up his cruelties on the two sons. you find yourself urging on the boy who needs to reach his adulthood without stepping into that adolescence bit. the stories and the poems within the movie are another part to look out for, like the one in the beginning of the movie really makes that voice in your head say "oh boy, this is going to be a good one"the little boy playing the role of the little brother, does an immaculate job, and like each of the very much senior actors, there doesn't really seem to be an effort going into the acting.perfection.this is the movie for people who don't just like their movies...but tend to live them. there is no khan or bachhan or roshan in the movie, and the boy is never growing up to be a teen heartthrob of the Indian cinema. but he sure will grow up to be an irrfan khan. this is not a typical larger than life bollywood story. this is a masterpiece, which thankfully is appreciated in its own time as well." 
" Intense but still heart touching","what an amazing direction by THE débutante DIRECTOR . very heart touching story and what makes it more emotional is i can relate the whole story to myself . at our age our hopes and dreams is our life no one can steal or destroy it at his own will even if it is our father .We will breathe that fresh and relaxing air that we always wanted . If it is stubborn and innocent than i want to be like that, i will learn from my mistakes . TIME WILL HEAL ALL PROBLEMS SOONER OR Of course LATERacting is very best in its own term. i saw it in the theater today that is why i am so pumped up. the songs are so heart warming that you want to sing with it at the moment. one word BRAVO THIS IS THE REAL Indian CINEMAAPNE PAANKHO KO KHOL KE BHARO UDAAN A MUST SEE FOR EVERYBODY" 
" Udaan - Flying High","There were very few movies that almost made me cry and I repeat almost cry. Edward Norton's American History X was the first and most recently Inception ( the sheer awesomeness in Nolan's writing almost made me cry). But while watching Udaan I was crying like a little boy lost in a big mall.The movie will not only make you cry it will make laugh it will make you frustrated. It has a story that everyone can relate to and is very well written by Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya. It is a must watch for for every parent and student. This movie is way better than 3 idiots . 3 Idiots even though is a very good film has a very commercial way of approach in its direction which I seriously despise and thats why 3 Idiots comes second best when it is compared with Udaan. I can't give the movie a 10/10 even though I want to because I gave Inception a 10/10 and giving any other movie a 10/10 would be an insult to inception. So Udaan gets a 9/10 from me and highly recommended as a must watch." 
" no heroism,no fantasies but appealing.............","in recent times, bollywood got a breakthrough after UDAAN. such a good movie this is... no heroism, no fantasies but hard to let ur mind free from the thoughts u get indulged into....a young lad who is living in the circumstances that is well familiar to many of young indians, does nothing fanatic.. nothing heroic until in last when he decided to not to repeat the history of events he faced.. not to make a man like his father again....the map of strict father portrayed well though sometimes exaggerating but also said to be emotional sometimes... but never to reveal the thing....the man like anurag kashyap looks like have an oath to change the prodigy... who can forget "black Friday"...the movie that told nothing but the truth..the... first of its kind to be unbiased... so, folks just clap for the new shining..." 
" Spread Your Wings And Fly To Your Destiny","For some reason I have been postponing watching 'Udaan' until finally I watched it last night. I figured, why shouldn't it be the first film I watch this year? I had only heard many good things about it but even then it surpassed my expectations. 'Udaan' is one of those rare Indian films that scores high on every component of filmmaking, be it, direction, writing, cinematography, casting, score... It looks authentic and it feels honest.What particularly stands out about 'Udaan' is how true to life it is and at the same time it's not a documentary style film but one with a great big heart that tells an inspiring story of a teenager fighting for his dream to become the man he aspires to. Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap have done an outstanding job in the writing department. It's very detailed without being showy, poetic without being operatic, subtle without being too restrained and poignant without being preachy.In addition, Motwane does a phenomenal job translating the words from paper to screen. The narrative style is superb and remains consistent throughout. The characters are very human and easily recognizable mostly because of how the relationships are depicted, with sincerity.Shetty's cinematography works in a subtle way. Every frame is photogenic but not to the point of looking like a postcard or being distracting. Trivedi's score is used very efficiently, never intrusive but rather contributing by echoing the mood of the sequences. Kalra's editing is solid as never does the pace feel uneven nor does the film lose its focus at any point.Now coming to the performances, each and every actor's portrayal is genuine. Starting with newcomer Rajat Barmecha who is spot on as he looks the part and acts sublime. Ronit Roy finally gets a role that showcases his previously unknown talent. This is definitely a breakthrough performance for the actor who's been in movies for almost two years. While his portrayal of the authoritarian father is haunting one can also sympathize for him as he himself is a victim of abuse and he really does believe that he's doing the best for his sons and yet shows signs of regret at some of the wrong decisions. Ram Kapoor is equally convincing as the supportive light-hearted uncle who is the polar opposite of the quick tempered father. And of course, last but not least, there is young Aayan Boradia who delivers one of the most accurate performances of a child. It's amazing how, mostly through non-verbal gestures, he displays Arjun's innocence, loneliness, quiet suffering and longing with such precision While most of the first act and second act of the film depicts Rohan and Arjun's quiet suffering, the final act is excellently cathartic. I don't mean cathartic in the sense that events take an explosive turn that involves loud confrontations. Here it's rather matter-of-factly but at the same time energetic, invigorating and symbolic. Even though I was expecting what Rohan would eventually do for himself to escape his father's imprisonment, there are some precious little surprises that happen along the way, making 'Udaan' a one-of-a-kind gem.'Udaan' is a celebration of the human spirit. I'm very glad I picked this movie to start the year."
