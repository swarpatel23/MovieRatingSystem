" A Bollywood Modern Day Story about Star Crossed Lovers","I heard varying comments prior to watching this film, and I have to say that I shall always follow my gut instinct from now on. This film is neither boring or slow paced! Whilst watching the trailers the first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful sets. And they did not disappoint! The set is magical. The acting is flawless. The music is brilliant. The story is well written, nicely paced and very artistic indeed. Clever and intellectual. A well deserved round of applause for both those in front of the scenes and behind. For anyone who has loved someone unconditionally. I would highly recommend to those who enjoyed films from Romeo and Juliet to Devdas to Moulin Rouge! ;)" 
" Only Sanjay LB can take this kind of movie!!!","Mvng slowly,but nicely taken. All credits goes to SLB.Songs are fantastic.....Ranbir Raj (Ranbir Kapoor), a free spirited idealist  dreamer, arrives in a dreamy surreal town and joins as a lead singer in its swankiest club. Here he bumps into Gulabji (Rani Mukerji), a prostitute, who immediately falls for his naivety and innocent charm. One night he notices a mysterious girl standing alone on a bridge holding an umbrella. As he tries to strike a conversation, she shies away. But he still keeps following her and both end up becoming friends. This mystery girl, Sakina (Sonam Kapoor) forever carries a sadness in her eyes which leaves Ranbir intrigued. But so mesmerized he is with her that his every minute goes into discussing her with his land lady, Lillipop (Zohra Sehgal) and Gulabji.Just when Ranbir is about to express his true feelings to her, she reveals the reason behind her unhappiness. She tells him she is waiting for her love, Imaan (Salman Khan) to return. A year back before leaving, he had promised that he would be back and meet her on the same bridge that he saw her waiting." 
" A Visual Treat!","A lot has been written and said about Saawariya. Majority of the critics and reviews have dismissed this movie! Well, I for one, almost gave it a miss (as it is I am not a huge fan of Mr.Bansali). But I saw the movie yesterday, and whoa-I was pleasantly surprised!!! It has to be, in my opinion, one of the most visually appealing movie of all time. I mean, right from the reel one, the movie speaks volumes about its grandeur. It is true delight on the visual senses. So why have the critics darned it? Well, I think you have to view "Saawariya" in its own context. Comaprisons just cannot be made. It's like a book of fairy-tales. each page in the book is rich in illustrations and drawings. Just holding the book sometimes can take you in a world of dreams. This movie is precisely like that and has to be viewed in that context. The music adds to its flow-it is the part of the package.Now to the performances: Sonam Kapoor has an angelic screen presence and her acting too is good for her debut movie. Ranbir Kapoor is a powerhouse of talent and a great screen presence too. For their first movie, the lead pair creates lots of magic! Salman Khan is barely there. Rani Mukherjee who plays a prostitute is awesome-I nearly fell in love with this prostitute!!! The movie does have some rough edges. At least a couple of sequences (including the ending) are way too abrupt! It's like the chef forgot to garnish his dish. All in all "Saawariya" is a movie that I think justifies my 8/10 rating. It is so visually appealing that one literally cannot take the eyes off! And it's not too taxing on the brains too-just a simple love story set in a far-far away land, narrated with flow and music, though at the end of it you might question the essence of Sonam's character. That to me was very baffling! Go for it!" 
" excellent film!","First of all after watching saawariya i still have not been able to understand why people did not like it. we should know that it is an art film and it should be looked at in the same way. we say we want different films now but when a director attempts a different film, we absolutely bash it and end up taking out as many flaws as we can. the main two characters off this film are "ranbir and sonam". now where was the city situated, in which era it is happening all this is not important. when we look at a painting, we don't look at where it is sitauted, we look at it's beauty and this exactly what saawariya is, it is a beautiful painting and we should be looking at it's beauty.You need to have an open mind and appreciation for art films to watch and digest this one. it is true that it's not mass appealing, because it doesn't have the jhatkas and the matkas in it. I recommend you go and watch it and forget about the reviews." 
" The best from a Indian filmmaker","Although most were expecting a lot more from this film , for me this film did not disappoint. This film is for people who are looking for something different in a bollywood movie.If you are one of those who want to experience something new and exciting and different, then do watch this film. this is a beautiful and amazing work by SLB .I rate this as the best movie of SLB as iv being a fan of his movies since his debut with hamoshi each and every movie is different from one another and from all other movies made in bollywood .. when he remade decdas many tried their hands with umrao jaan , don and sholay but no one succeeded becos its not that everyone can make a great story into a great movie.as for the time its only SLB who have done this. and for the people who could not find a plot from this movie than better watch this again or read the short story White Nights." 
" This movie is not for everyone! Believe and feel of LOVE has to be strong to be in TRANCE... If you have not enjoyed the movie then truly you have never been in love!","Loads of criticism has been going around for this movie but allow me to say that this movie is not really for everyone. The feeling and believe in love has to be strong to get into the trance of Saawariya...If you have been in love then after watching this movie you will easily say that this movie is a "Fairy Love Tale". I say this because the characters and their chemistry can make you feel that it is out of the world.The character of 'Saawariya' itself is sketched with such perfection that it can actually make you feel the power of LOVE. It is the way too pure.The songs are so beautifully choreographed that it makes you feel the purity of the Artist, SLB himself. It is indeed a totally new way of making a movie and for me it strengthen the believe that if some one can bring Oscar to Sub Continent then it has to be SLB's art of perfection...Overall, a master piece of SLB. Just don't go to watch it; I request you to FEEL the FEEL of Saawariya!" 
" Treat your eyes; your ears; your soul!","After you've seen this Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie; you'll probably forget how to say the title of the movie without singing it. I feel ashamed that following an over-flooding of my head with bad reviews on this movie, I actually watched it only when I was dragged to the cinema by a friend who believes in SLB more than me. And now I cannot thank the friend more for showing what I think is the best cinematic production in Bollywood ever. Don't hesitate to have high expectations since this one is made to beat them.This movie is not a comedy- so comparing it with the parallel-released movie for the amount of laughs it gives you is hardly a fair evaluation. It's a musical based on the story by Fyodor Dostoevsky's "White Nights". It's the story of love- not the Soni-Mahiwal and Veer-Zaara type of love but just love. It's the love that just happens in a snap and sweeps you off your feet. It's definitely the type of love story that Bollywood has never narrated before. There's no family rivalry; no social drama; no unrealistic action; nothing except the love of Saawariya.The debutant actors Ranbir and Sonam couldn't have started their career with better performances. While we'll have to wait and see how the newbies fair on the spectrum of acting when they do other films with hopefully varying roles; but for a start they completely make you believe in their characters in Saawariya. Sonam is a beauty- the type that you don't lust for because it's so pure- the type you fall in love with. And Ranbir has a disarming smile and a style that will easily get him inside every girl's dream. And with the first-time-ever portrayal of male sensuality in Bollywood in a song with him barely in the towel; Ranbir might be more than smiling in the ladies' dreams.The movie boasts of a powerful cast besides the lead actors too. We have yet another jaw-dropping performance by Rani Mukherjee  her choreography in the song 'Chabeela' is amazing. Salmaan is playing a tough guy with little dialogues but fitting in this role perfectly. Zohra Sehgal is shining through remarkably as well. Most importantly, no body is dominating the screen over the others with a clichéd acting; the characters seem to gel together and you watch every scene believing in them and believing in the magic that the director is pulling in front of your eyes with many deeply thought over dialogues; subtle appearances; through the character's eyes; through the water and the weather and even the street lights.The music score of the movie was great. Some of the songs that have accompanying dances are beautiful and the lyrics by Sameer are touching. Playback singers really draw your heart close into the sentiment of the song with their melodious voice with emotions and rhythm. Kudos to the two new singers Shail and Parthiv! The best of everything is still the dream-world like sets. When I saw the trailers; I felt it was too unrealistic to be good. But with the story that's meant to be a tale-of-love narrated by Rani herself; the sets were perfect to create the atmosphere of a delightful small town far away somewhere love has it's own magical dimension.I give the movie an 8/10 for the new standard it has established in Bollywood; for the acting of every single actor in it; for the music; for the dances; for the picturesque sets; for the direction; for this movie being really good cinema. If the entertainment you are looking for is more than a few skin-deep smiles; this will be a treat! A treat not just for your eyes but for your ears too and it will even leave you with a warm thought when the credits roll at the end." 
" Saawariya rocks!","This movie will be framed in gold as one of the most astonishing movies ever made in Indian cinema. Each and every scene gives you an impression of 2.5yrs of real efforts done by the great Sanjay Leela Bhansali. He has truly evolved the Indian cinema with his unique way of movie making. He has emerged as one of the most daring movie makers in the world, specially in India. This masterpiece is about an imaginary world about 2 lovers and their journey towards true love. Raj played by Ranbir Kapoor and Sakina played by Sonam Kapoor have done marvelous job as the lead pair. Both are looking immensely confident and amazing in this movie. They are going to be the new superstars of Bollywood as they have shown a lot of talent and amazing chemistry. They both are so true and close to their roles that their characters-Raj and Sakina will be remembered in lines of DDLJ, QSQT and Bobby.Ranbir is sure-shot a star material and so is Sonam. The movie starts with Ranbir coming to this imaginary world and how he mesmerizes Gulab, a prostitute played by Rani Mukherjee and gets in to her heart as a special admirer. With her help, he manages to stay with Zohra Sehgal. An old women who found his lost son in Ranbir. The movie then takes you in a steady journey of Raj meeting Sakina and how they found or lose their love. To be honest, I'm not a great fan of sad-ending movies but Saawariya is a true exception.Remember those days when your grandma or mom tells you a story about fairy world? How an angel comes to help a small girl and singing a beautiful song for her which led trees, rivers, birds to rhyme and enjoy all together? This movie is exactly about that kind of world with lots of hope and sacrifices for the true love.Understand, there is no set of format to make a movie where a movie should have a flow from A to Z. Its all about understanding the movie with a different set of mind. There are some classic movies like Satya and Company which are so true to real bad world. But with Saawariya its not about how true or logical you are, its about thinking all good things and getting in to the flow of the movie.Zohra Sehgal as an old lady who helps Raj in this new town is also a strong pillar to hold this movie in terms of acting and appearance. Salman has done a descent job in a cameo appearance and Rani is wonderful in her performance and dancing.Its sheer delight listening such a soothing music after very-very long time and my favorites are 'Jab se tere naina', 'Yun shabnami' and of course, the title track-'Saawariya'.All said and done, its a lovely movie with great performances from Ranbir, Sonam, Zohra and Rani. This is the first movie which has impressed me with its looks and cinematography. Hail Sanjay Leela Bhansali!" 
" Saawariya-A meditation on love","Saawariya is not your typical dancing around trees romance but a mood piece exploring nostalgia, melodrama, loss, loneliness and love in various forms - first love, obsessive love, physical love, and heartbreak. The movie is directed by one of the last few auteur's of Indian cinema who imbues it with his expansive vision . Bhansali's unmistakable imprint is all over this work. He obviously feels great kinship for Hindi movies and characters of the 50's and 60's and takes elements from those films and combines them with a Moulin Rouge inspired mies-en-scene where old fashioned pimps and contemporary prostitutes with retro hairstyles congregate in a studio generated Muslim ghetto to create a cinematic landscape all his own. While the directors cinematic landscape may be off putting to some, this viewer bought it hook line and sinker! I can almost see Johnny Walker in the role of the front desk clerk at the seedy Momin Lodge in Oldtown and the casting of Begum Para definitely adds an element of credibility to the proceedings. Zohra Sehgal never ceases to amaze and the perfect casting for this movie sets the table for the deliciously angst-filled four course meal the director serves for us. This timeless, nameless place befit a film that is grounded in abstract and existential themes rather than plot as the women characters are caught up in an endless cycle of waiting  Lollipop for her son, Sakina's grandmother for her tenants and her own son, and Sakina for her lover. The central character is Ranbir Raj, a throwback to Raj Kapoor's persona from the 50s' - the lovable tramp, a bit of a goof-ball, who usually gets his heart broken.. There are many references to this , from the bowler hat to the umbrella . Ranbir does do a very good job portraying the complex emotional arc of his character from the "thunderbolt" of love at first sight to unrequited love. Sonam bears more than a passing resemblance to Waheeda Rehman in this film, especially the Waheeda from Chaudvin ka Chand and her character seems to be a direct inspiration for Sakina in this film, as she obsessively waits for her lover to return. Sonam has a complex many layered role, and she comes through in a more than adequate manner, considering that this is her first movie. Salman is an appropriate object of desire in his brief appearance and Rani steals the show with her clever one liners. The music is melodious and woven easily into the film. It is truly a concept album, reflecting the various shades of love, from the dizzying heights of first love (Masha Allah, Jab SE Tere), to playful romance (Thode badmaash) ,to intense romance (Yoon shabnami, Jaan-e Jaan) to heartbreak( Daras bina nahin) .The many years spent on perfecting this soundtrack show and how! The fantastic and poignant song "Pari" which is beautifully pasteurized on the ladies of the night stands out in particular. Of course, the movie is visually spectacular with many "Bhansali" moments. The lighting and cinematography is entirely suited to the theme , mood and atmosphere of the movie. At times the pacing is decidedly slow but just at the right moment, the movie picks up. A special mention should be made of the lyrical quality of the parting scene between the two protagonists. Ranbir and Sonam handled this scene beautifully, both with words said and unsaid . The ending could easily have become a maudlin affair, but it was genuinely affecting leaving a bittersweet aftertaste. The movie recalls the slow languid pace, the claustrophobia and language of the Muslim culture of days gone by. I think this is Bhansali's homage to the era of Kamal Amrohi and Gurudutt. Nobody makes movies like this anymore and I applaud Mr. Bhansali for having the courage and conviction to stick to his vision. I am sure most of the regular desi junta will not get this movie, but , oh well, its their loss.Like someone said in an earlier review, this is destined to be a desi post modern cult classic!" 
" Refreshingly Different","I can understand why some are not satisfied with this film as it is not the typical predictable Bollywood fare, however it is a refreshingly unique piece of Indian cinema. Based upon a 19th century short story by famed Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky; its stunning fantasy visuals provide a perfect setting for the romantic themes.*** SPOILER *** For me, the subtlety of the story revolves around the purity of true love. All of the main characters have an unconditional, unselfish love for another, including the heroine; until the last minute when she loses faith in the promised return of her mysterious hero, but whose fears are unfounded.It can be succinctly summarised in the famous quote by Kahlil Gibran: "If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. And if they don't, they never were."" 
" A Magical Fairy Tale Which Will Both Delight You and Entertain You!","Let me preface this review by writing that I enjoyed Sanjay Leela Bhansali's "Black" so much, I have looked forward to "Saawariya" for months, with the highest of expectations. And once more, I was not disappointed. Mr. Bhansali tells Dostoevsky short story "The White Nights" as a fluid, brilliantly colored and magical fairy tale. Ever since I was turned on to Mr. Bhansali's work with "Black" - and later watched"Devdas" - I have thought of him as the modern day, Hindi film industry's answer to Luchino Visconti. So it wasn't a complete surprise to learn that Visconti made a film titled "Le Notti Bianche" which was also based on the same short story. Both directors possess a unique touch with color, texture and cinematic air quality that is truly able to transport the viewer into their story, completely and delightedly. Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor are perfectly cast as the misguided lovers and Salman Khan is finally playing a character who seems to read deep into his soul and bring out the sultry quality that he so naturally possesses. "Saawariya" is not so much a Bollywood film meant to tug at your heart strings and leave you pining for your own unrequited love, but more a mood piece which will leave you wishing you could live in the imaginary world of pure, kind street walkers, beautiful all-white Eid nights and women's clothes that put French couturiers to shame. It is, as cinema is meant to be at its very root, a world of complete and utter escapism." 
" wonderful movie!","I wonder what has gone into those peoples heads who think that this movie is bad.It was such a beautiful film.This film had everything what a good movie should have strong performances,beautiful sets,soothing music,excellent direction. Ranbir Kapoor does a commendable job as Raj,a kind hearted charming boy,who comes in a town for work.Love strikes him when he sees Sakina(Sonam Kapoor),a beautiful young lady.Sakina has her own past.she had been waiting for her love.Raj is heartbroken on knowing her story but he continues to be her friend. Rani Mukherji is the one whom i admired the most in the movie.She plays a kind hearted prostitute.Her appearance really rocked the scene.i have started liking her more after this film.Salman khan had a small role but he portrayed his character well. The person who made these two and half hours of sheer magic is Mr.Sanjay Leela Bhansali.Hats off to you sir!" 
" A sweet little love story with Beautiful environment","Hats of for SLB for making a different kind of movie, its very different from the other movies he made, and yet not as good as the others, but Sawwaria is still a good movie to watch.The love story is sweet and both Ranbir and Sonam Kapoor acted really well, and the direction was superb for the movie.A good advice for you SLB, don't spend 4 years on your next project, we love to see your movies and do experiment but keep the story-line strong.People who knows what real love is and have lost it, they will love the movie.Saawaria is much better than Om SHanti Om (eventhough SRK is still the King of Bollywood).Om Shanti Om is for the Front-seater, and Saawaria is for the Metro people..go see it in cinema you will love it." 
" Excellent movie .. sheer poetry","I strongly disagree people who have slammed this movie. This movie is a piece of art.I had heard bad review of this movie but wanted to see it myself to decide. Sadly I didn't see it on the big screen to maximize my enjoyment. Nevertheless it was sheer joy to enjoy it on my big screen TV. From the moment I sat down till the movie ended it was non stop poetry. The songs, the acting , the back drop - it was like watching a live play - simply beautiful. The songs are one of the best compositions.. the newcomers were okay but Rani was superb. If you see from the directors eye this movie is sheer brilliant work. The concept is novel the execution is methodic and clean. Overall a nice watch. Highly recommended. Well compared to watching Om shanti Om on the big screen I regret giving this a miss which was playing in an adjacent theaters.. sadly with empty seats. I think bad publicity and do I say negative publicity killed this movie. Well it was a gem of a movie which many sadly missed or just didn't get it." 
" Mishap or Misunderstood?","A grossly misunderstood masterpiece of a movie from Bhansali that might just drive him back to commercial facades only because hardly anyone is able to understand this movie, far appreciate it. I consider it as good as his best work (Khamoshi - The Musical) and in some ways even better. It is more thematic, more intimate and far more mature, yet made with the fervor of boyish charm that Raj (Ranbir Kapoor) exudes as the main lead. It also equally shares the beautiful self-alluring dream-world inhabitance as lived by Sakina (Sonam Kapoor), the other half of the lead pair. On par with any of world cinema in techniques (direction, editing, cinematography, production - oh, the production!), Bhansali weaves for us an exquisite experience that is so illusive that it is an achievement in itself that he actually got a free hand from the producers to make and release the movie as it is.I may have lost my marbles completely and this movie may forever be forgotten, but I am willing to compare it to the fate of Pyaasa - chided, derided and unforgiven on release; one of the greatest masterpieces out of India in retrospect." 
" Not that bad... It was good.","I saw Saawariya yesterday and I want to share my review about this movie. Saawariya is a short-story poetry based Bollywood movie. Of course it is very hard to translate a short story which is a poetry to the big screen. Fyodor Dostoevsky's 'White Nights' was written a century ago in Russian. The poem is beautiful and extremely touching and emotional. About the movie, I think both the new comers (Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor) have done a wonderful job in first film. And of course there is Rani and Salman in this film. Salman has a very short role but Rani takes your heart away. And Zohra Sehgal is always delightful.Film starts out with a prostitute, Gulab 'ji' (Rani Mukherjee) narrating his friend's story. Ranbir Raj, is a young man who comes to a beautiful 'town' to get a job. He gets job in a bar. Eventually he makes Gulab Ji his friend. One night he sees a mysterious girl, Sakina crying in the bridge. He asks her why she is crying, then she says that she is waiting for her lover, Imaan (Salman Khan), who has been gone to some 'country'. She asks him to help her in finding him. In the process they become very close. Raj falls in love with her but Sakina is very confused. She thinks that she likes Raj but the same time when she thinks of Imaan, she starts looking for him. In the end, Imaan comes and Sakina goes with her. Raj is alone, alone with memories of Sakina.The movie's sets are wonderful, cinematography is amazing, and music is awe-awesome. Only I have one problem with was screenplay, being very strict and sometimes lenient to the picturization. Story suffers sometimes, but in the end you will leave theater with wonderful memories, and of course you will be sad. The movie has fairytale touch, so you don't have to think about which city they are wandering in? What is background of Raj? Why Imaan leaves his town in a haste? What happens to Gulabji in the end? and so on... You will enjoy it if you stop looking for these answers, but you can create your own answers in your mind.On an ending note, I liked this movie and I hate those critics who are giving this movie a rating of 2 out of 5. This is a beautiful movie, and it will surely touch your heart (ofcourse if you have heart!).8 out of 10."
