" Enjoyable movie made more watchable by the hot and lovely Mallika","Khwahish is not an original movie. It is based upon Erich Segal's famous novel "Love Story", which was made into a successful film in 1970. The story may not be new, but the writing was probably solid enough to make this romantic drama engaging. The film looked authentic, and the depiction was very simple. It was quite atypical in that it involved kissing scenes and several discussions about sex and social values. Even when the film entered its emotional phase, it was not overly melodramatic. The characters of Amar and particularly Lekha were quite interesting. He is a serious, headstrong and struggling guy, she is a simple, forthright, no-nonsense and smart girl, who is a fan of RD Burman's music. Their relationship was according to me portrayed quite well. The relationship between Lekha and her father Ulhas was also well done. Khawahish is Mallika Sherwat's film. She is the best thing about this film and the main reason it actually works. This is by no means a great performance, but she was simply lovable and played her role as naturally as she could, with evident sincerity and energy. Not to forget that she was absolutely sizzling and super sexy. Himanshu Malik was just okay in his role, while Mahmud Babai was fine as Lekha's loving father Ulhas. The soundtrack is one more reason to watch this film, and it gives the film a certain charm not warranted by the script. Asha Bhosle sings most of the songs and she does it brilliantly. My most favourite song is "Jaanemann", which was wonderful. Khwahish is not a great film, it lacks depth and at some points it is a bit slow, with the second half going downhill and losing its effervescence. That said, after all it does manage to move you with its final emotional proceedings and its tragic ending and is an overall enjoyable film despite the usual problems." 
" Overall a good movie","Mallika sherawat is a pretty decent actress. I thought this was going to be a crappy movie, but I was surprised. I wont say its a wonderfully directed movie, but the comedy aspects of the movie were hilarious. Some scenes like the hero and the heroines father drinking liquor from mugs inside a bathroom were hilarious. The condom purchasing scene is also pretty funny. The hero is a really bad actor though and I don't think has much of a future in movies. Overall, I'd say the story is just a run of the mill commercial story, but Mallika actually acted really well and I had a good time watching the movie. In fact, I'd say the movie works primarily because of mallika. Her dad in the movie also does a good job. The final parts of the movie are really well acted out and are very emotional. I recommend watching this movie without too many expectations." 
" Khwahish - To wish, To want. (I "wish" I hadn't seen the movie!)","**SPOILERS**"How I "wish" I hadn't seen the poster, How I "wish" these marketing guys weren't so darn good at their jobs, how I "wish"......etc etc" Just some of the thoughts that run through your mind after 3 minutes of Khwahish!
The title is a misnomer, the raunchy posters are misleading and the movie misdirected.The first 3 minutes involve a monologue from the hero about his love and their life together. The setting is supposed to be sad and the tone serious but the sheer banality of the dialogues, not to mention the dead pan delivery, has the audience in splits.As the posters depict, its a love story (atleast they stuck to that part of the advertised theme!) between a rich man and a poor girl (if poor people dress like that then I wanna be poor!). About how they don't have much in common (except their low IQs) but still fall in love and get married and their lives together.******************************SPOILER****************************The posters allude at a lot of steamy scenes between the protagonists (thats what draws the crowd in) but what you really get is a show of flesh, a couple of real kisses (no two flowers or two bees) and a lot of free "talk" about sex.
********************END OF SPOILER**************************The acting is bad and exaggerated. All dialogues are delivered in the same monotone (the audience is in splits during all the wrong scenes) and some of the scenes are downright unbelievable. (like the heroine singing at her classical music concert).All said and done the movie does have something different to offer.The hero shows more flesh than the herione, the girl's dad is a real pal, the girl advocates safe sex and she earns and looks after the house while he completes his studies.
Different ideas all but sadly, just not enough to make this movie a winner." 
" khhhWAISHall","Khwaish Picked up this movie at Atlantic Video, frankly attracted by the steamy cover starring Mallika Sherawat and a guy I really did not care about.What's new? Mallika Sherawat got introduced through this movie. I have seen Murder before, so her physique was kind of a disappointment here, but I'll catch the glimpse nonetheless! Noticeable: Almost every bit of Mallika is up for a view! Her acting comes as a real surprise. Now, here is a quality actress who does not mind exposure at all.. in fact she wants it! The actor was a real dud and a third class aadi aal.. nothing else! Verdict: The movie was nothing if there was no Mallika. She alone is the star in the movie. Mallika's 'acting' gets an A. The story, technicians, music and pretty much everything else was way below average! I guess you cannot blame them. How could they have concentrated on their work?" 
" One of the best movies","This movie is Indianised version of "Love Story" but dialogs and acting of all the stars is excellent. It does have scenes if kiss and romance which may shock most Indians, that is why they did not appreciate it. I have save it on tape and intend to show it to my friends and family.The actors and actresses are not very well known but they have done great justice to their roles. Mahmood Babai as father of Lekha's father is so remarkable a character that it is delight to see him whenever he is on the screen.Shivaji Satham has very small presence but is so natural and reminds me of my own father. It is delight to see him embrace Amar in the last scene." 
" Copy of famous novel "Love Story" by Eric Segal","It is a copy of "Love Story". For those of you who have read the novel or seen the English movie with same title "Love Story", don't watch this movie. The actors specially Himanshu Malik needs to go some acting school to do better. The credited cast lacks acting skills and they have spoiled the beauty of the movie. It could have been made better by taking some experienced cast." 
" Young couple of different wealth levels make it on their own, but a fatal disease intervenes.","Amar and Lekha meet in a clothing store where they haggle over a pajama-kurta set, where he wants the pajama and she wants the kurta. They start spending time together while they bicker. They have 3 months to go in university. At graduation, they still have not made plans, but they do fall in love. Despite the wealth disparity, they decide to marry.Oops. Amar's father cuts him off. They marry through Lekha's family. They start out happily, but the money runs low. Her family helps out; she does some tutoring in music. He sells his BMW motorcycle, and tries to succeed at school.Lekha gets to know Amar's mother. By happy circumstance, they both like Rahul Dev Burman's music. That goes rather well. They set up a meeting, at which Amar and his father might reconcile. Amar cancels it, and is harsh to Lekha when she tries to soften the message over the telephone. Time goes on, and Amar graduates and gets a good (perhaps not great) job, and they move to a better place.The job provides for them, which is good, but they have less time together. They try a party, which was fun, but not enough. Then they try to start a child. When conception eludes them, they seek medical clarification. Unfortunately, Lekha's been found to have a fatal disease, and will die soon.Amar borrows money from his father, and takes Lekha on vacation. They have a great time, but Lekha eventually tells Amar that she got the bad prognosis from their doctor. They have a long, emotionally sad talk. Lekha even found out through Amar's mother that Amar borrowed money for a problem; the two of them figured everything out.The good-bye is extended. Will Amar reconcile with his parents?------Scores------Cinematography: 10/10 Beautifully done, in 2.35 aspect ratio.Sound: 7/10 Adequate, but does not match the quality of the camera work.Acting: 6/10 Liked Mallika Sherawat (Anu) and the three actors who played the parents. The supporting actors could have been better, but Himanshu Malik was the weakest link.Screenplay: 7/10 Has a beginning, middle, and an end; the logical progression seemed satisfactory if overly slow. 110 minutes might have been a better running length.Musical Numbers: 5/10 Definitely a weak point, both for singing quality and presentation." 
" A god-awful piece of bovine excrement","A rehash of "Love story" - the opening monologue is a verbatim translation - this film is a prime candidate for "cruel and unusal punishment". To say that the actors have the acting range of wooden puppets is actually insulting to said puppets. The lead actor should be disbarred from acting ever again. To sum up, given the choice between a root-canal and watching the movie, i would exhort you to choose theformer."
