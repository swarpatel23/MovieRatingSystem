" 5 cricket players are bribed to throw the 2007 world cup; after a 4 year ban they come back to redeem themselves in the 2011 world cup.","When we looked at the blurb on the back of this movie, we thought oh boy, another great Bollywood sports movie! But halfway through we realized that we weren't just watching the opening montage before the character development began; the whole movie was a montage. This film has all the elements essential to a Bollywood sports drama: a promising young cricket player who gives in to the allure of bribery, a loving, traditional family who he betrays, a faithful girlfriend he cheats on, and betrayal of country and culture; rioters destroying his parents' home, his parents rejecting him and his father suffering a health breakdown from the shock and shame, and a long comeback to victory, reconciliation, and regaining the trust of friends and countrymen. This is all so predictable that a spoiler alert is hardly needed. However these are all elements that should have been filled in with character development; instead it just goes from one step to the next, giving barely any context, barely any character development, barely any time to enjoy the climaxes and reconciliations. It's like a montage of sports drama montages. We were fully willing to be drawn into the drama, to have our emotions manipulated, but the movie was incapable of doing this. You weren't given time to dwell on the heartbreak he goes through, or even feel the cathartic effect of everything coming right at the end. (If you want to see a movie with exactly the same elements done right, that really tears at your heartstrings, see Victory, starring Harman Baweja.)"
