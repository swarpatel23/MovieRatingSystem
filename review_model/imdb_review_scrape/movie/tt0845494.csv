" Inspiring movie","I am not of Indian decent but i love watching Bollywood movies of late. They maybe generally viewed by the western country moviegoers/watchers as cheesy due to to their song& dance but take time to just stop for a while and actually watch the whole film, you will find them interesting if not interesting. This film is one of them that just gets better the longer you spend watching it.The boy hero Nanhe is your typical boy from the "other" side of the road one could say. He's dirt poor and illiterate. But even though illiterate, he knows four languages, a valuable skill he has for his trade (safari tourist guide). His boss, they call her "madame" has faith in this kid that given the much needed education, can be really successful in life. However, Nanhe isn't interested in learning at all, all he dreams of is meeting up with his "friend" Bobby Deol, the Bollywood actor.Reluctant nonetheless, he gives in to the wishes of his mother and boss to study. This due to the fact that his "friend" told him to do so and value the privilege to to be able to study. Without having to say too much about the movie, our boy protagonist spends time with his friend while balancing it with his studies. His friend not only spends time with him but also inspires him in many ways.the end part might be a bit cheesy but heart warming still. Overall, Its a definitely a good break from your typical Hollywood film. The characters are well played out, story pacing might be slow at times, but its forgivable and Nanhe the boy protagonist just grows into you. its not Oscar level material but its a feel good movie that's worth the watch." 
" a movie for every one","This movie definitely deserves to be tax-free, as it caters to many segments of film viewers, embedding a very important message, especially for people of developing countries where full scale literacy of its citizens is still an issue. An incident in the movie where someone puts a tattoo on the hero of the movie the small child Nanhe's hand and on his camel derogatorily writing 'Gadha' which means donkey and the hero does not know it, and only realizes it when everybody makes fun of him, thats when the message of getting educated seeps deep into his psyche. This reminds one of an old movie called 'Unpadh' for the message of how important it is to be educated and also of another recent movie called 'Billu barber' later renamed 'Billu' starring Shahrukh Khan showing the craze of fans for their film stars in small towns of India, herein one cannot forget the Jaya Bahaduri starrer 'Guddi'. This is a must-see movie for children. There cannot be a more innocent movie for anybody with a message than Nanhe Jaisalmer." 
" Nanhe Jaisalmer is an Excellent movie. 100% ratings.","Movir: Nanhe Jaisalmer - 2007 .Nanhe Jaisalmer is a very nice movie. It shows great sense of inspirational. This movie specifies the relation between two people of different worlds. One is only a guide and camel safari who speaks four languages known as "Nanhe Jaisalmer" or "Nanhe". And, another one is a Film Actor Bobby Deol. Nanhe room is full of Bobby deols posters. This shows Nanhe's respect to his friend Bobby Deol. Nanhe calls his friend as 'dost'and as his friend is an actor.Thus, we can say that Nanhe Jaislmer is a very nice movie of 2007. This movie is really good. Truly speaking, this is movie is a HIT and I will give it 100% ratings to th movie "Nanhe Jaisalmer." To conclude, I will say "Nanhe Jaisalmer" is a HIT movie. It deserves 100% ratings at all!Thank You, Ankit Gupta (M):9810618561" 
" It could be so much more.","I like Bobby Deol movies, and I have been to Jaisalmer. It was nice to see the place once again in a Bollywood movie. Like I have experienced Jaisalmer, exactly like that I have seen it in the movie.The movie is about a boy called Nanhe, he live in Jaisalmer. He is a fan of Bobby Deol, the actor. He has no friends of his own age, and his hero Bobby Deol helps him when he is all alone.The movie was good, but it was oblivious in the beginning that the boy was schizo. At the end of the movie, they show you that Bobby Deol is his imagination. It is done a lot of times! They show how Bobby say something on t.v. and then they show you how Bobby say it to the boy in his imagination. The first time it was okay, but after three times it became boring. Besides that, how can Bobby Deol be his imagination, when his sister has seen Bobby Deol too? It was an okay movie, but not very good."
