" flawless...","this is a real gem of a movie...it's right there among the top 5 of my favorite Hindi movies. the movie hooks you right away and the plot never slackens throughout...coupled with realistic treatment, it makes the movie an instant favorite. also the subject is very different - the proxy war waged by Pakistan's ISI. refreshingly and reassuringly, there are no corrupt cops in the movie! Aamir Khan as ACP Rathore is superb. he brings alive a cop's passion and determination to cleanse the system of criminals. the action sequences are played out very realistically. Mukesh Rishi as ACP's right hand man is just brilliant! This actor usually plays only "black" characters - this surely added to the impact of his performance (for me, at least). There are some truly heart-warming scenes of Rathore with his family. Sonali Bendre as Rathore's love interest provided some (much-needed) light moments. And, finally, Naseeruddin Shah as ghazal singer-cum-terrorist played his part with understated villainy. i love such villains - they seem so real! the climax is truly innovative - it invariably brings a smile to your face. It's difficult to spot a flaw in the movie. and considering that it's the director's debut film, you have to doff your hat to him." 
" Aamir's the best actor- undisputed. Awesome movie which dealt with so many issues.","Bollywood to me started with sarfarosh. B4 watching sarfarosh, me n my pals were like these "cool" Hollywood movie buffs. Always prefering Sterling, New excelsior n Regal theaters in mumbai for Hollywood stuff. But sarfarosh changed everything. One day me n my fiancé jus entered this theatre midway without realising which movie was running. N that particular time this beer bar dance sequence from sarfarosh was going on. She told wtf, which z grade film did v enter for. Then v decided at least v wait till one hour. N by GOD, what an engrossing movie. N once the credits rolled v both looked at each other. During those days VHS rental was cheap n it used to b available easily. I saw it  again. Mind blowng experience. The editing of the movie was brilliant. Aamir's acting was top notch. Mukesh rishi deserved best supporting actor award. The movie dealt with so many important issues simultaneously especially during that era. Awesome movie. It too broke all the norms of a typical Bollywood trash." 
" great movie - definitely worth a watch","This movie leaves the theatre with you and stays in your mind for a long time. A realistic and honest look at the problems our police system is facing is the theme of this movie. Amir Khan, is as usual,incomparable and produces a strong and honest performance. He and his team are a bunch of honest, hard-working cops trying to get Mumbai rid of all the terrorism and criminals. Amir Khan plays a tough cop with a rough past (his brother was killed by gangsters) and the event has led him to try and sweep crime away from Mumbai. All the actors in the movie have done their job very well, especially the actors in Amir Khan's police team. Sonali Bendre has done as much justice as she could to her role, which is kind of minimal and unfair. Yet, the movie is a great one. Naseeruddin shah is amazing as usual, and goes through with his character with ease and perfection.Worth a watch, the movie will surely not fail to impress." 
" Best Directorial Debut","John Matthan directs a fantastic film in his directorial debut. With so many characters popping in one after the other it would have been very difficult to maintain the flow of the film which John Matthan has done very successfuly. Aamir Khan as usual has given an excellent performance as A.C.P Rathore who is set to end the flow of Arms and ammunition from Pakistan to India. Aamir, the dedicated actor that he is, had studied all about the police force, the IPS people, talked with many police officers and stayed with some of them to study the role of ACP rathore.Nasserudin Shah has only 6 to 7 scenes but he dominates the movie. He has the role which was similarly played by Jack Nicholson in 'A Few Good Men'. Sonali Bendre is wasted in what turns out to be a fine performance by her. The surprise factor of the film is the acting of Mukesh Rishi which has got lots of critical acclaim from the critics and the general audience. Do not be surprised if he wins all the awards for "The Best Supporting Actor". Although the film is very predictible,the climax is the best part of the scene. This is the one of the best climax ever used in an hindi movie. Its hard to believe that this is John's directorial/writing debut." 
" A good movie, very good action scenes","The back of the DVD case claims that Sarfarosh is the first Hindi movie to take a look at some of the real reasons behind terrorism and insurgency in India. This seems like a fairly radical claim that I doubt they could really defend even though my knowledge of Hindi cinema is still far from complete. DIL SE seemed like a pretty honest examination of the subject to me, and that was several years earlier. I don't want to hold the claims on the DVD case against the movie though, as SARFAROSH is certainly an interesting take on the subject.Ajay Singh's brother is killed and his father brain damaged by terrorists when Ajay is a small boy, because his father was going to stand up against them in court or something. Ajay takes this to heart (as you would), and as a young adult he devotes himself to becoming a police inspector and fighting against crime, and terrorists in particular. The movie is essentially about one case, where Ajay has to get to the roots of an operation smuggling guns into the country. The operation is backed by a Pakistani general, with the rationale that arming criminals in India is a cheap but effective way of waging war. The movie does push a fairly unbalanced "Pakistan aggressors, India = victims" message, though it is very careful/keen not to equate this with Muslim vs Hindu and turn it into a religious issue.
The movie is fairly serious throughout - although there is a romantic interest (the lovely Sonali Bendre), it's not overplayed and does serve a useful function by building the character of Ajay and putting the case in the context of his life. For the most part though, the movie is focussed on the investigation and the encounters between the police and the criminals as they trace the criminal network closer to its roots. It's quite an action packed movie, and features some of the best action scenes I've seen in an Indian movie. No bullet ballet or kung fu, but quite realistic fights and shootouts that are never-the-less very well choreographed and filmed. The movie bears an 18 rating, because the action does get quite violent. A lot of people die in the course of the movie, and a few of them in quite gruesome ways. One thing I've noticed in quite a lot of Asian movies is that police violence is treated quite sympathetically - even as quite noble. The cops in Sarfarosh don't mess around - if threatening, beating or framing a criminal is the best way to get a result then they don't hesitate to do so. If a criminal happens to get killed in the course of an operation then they don't seem terribly upset either, unless it was somebody they wanted to interrogate .Ajay Singh is played by Aamir Khan, an actor I haven't come across before. He's not a pretty boy by any means, but he does a very good job with the character. It's a good character too - well developed and believable, honorable without being sanctimonius. The rest of the cast all do a good job too, although Sonali Bendre doesn't have a lot to do except look pretty and dance around in the musical numbers.The script for the movie is very tight, with both the criminals and the cops operations and motivations seeming quite convincing. The movie does veer a little towards preaching in places, especially towards the end, but this is forgivable. The direction is very confident and focussed, and sound and cinematography throughout are good throughout.All round, a good movie worth seeking out." 
" Universally liked movie","Sarfarosh is a movie very few people can dislike.Movie is neither intense one nor over exerting.It is a movie tightly followed to a very good script.Story of the movie is fast paced,engaging like Sidney Sheldon's novels, has depth and all characters looks very natural and evolved.Although movie is over 3 hrs long but time just flies by.Topics like terrorism,crime , patriotism are dealt with a great aplomb.How arms are smuggled through border and reaches naxalites or bandits,how the police functions,movie makers had clear idea of.It is one good performance of Mukesh rishi as saleem,Aamir khan as ACP and even other small characters like Aamir's department's colleague,family members, everybody has done excellent job.None of the scenes in film looks forcefully inserted and movie progresses to a very concluding climax with every scene.A great movie from debutant director John Mathew Mathhan." 
" Crisp Script, Cracking Movie!","Who said Indians cannot make action movies. "Sarfarosh" can be compared to any of the leading hollywood actioners. Aamir Khan is too tough to look sweet in this movie. His commitment to perfection can be seen in the way he carried the movie on his shoulders. The director John too did a great job. Though I feel Naseerudin Shah's role could have got more meat as his potential wasn't tapped complete. Music too is very good. Sonali should start looking serious than trying to look cute, as she is no longer a new comer. A solid movie with sharp dialogues and a crisp script." 
" The best part ...","One of the best things about this movie is that it shows the hero taking the right path to revenge. He becomes an IPS Officer and concentrates on eradicating crime. This is in contrast with the regular Bollywood hero, who takes the shorter and easier path justified with tit-for-tat logic to kill a particular villain in the story. Thus, this movie rises above the parochial view of solving problems through one particular revenge. Otherwise also, of late Bollywood heroes are never shown as studious ones because it is only the poor students that most people like to relate to and studious people or anyone can laugh on them as well." 
" Best movie, Best Performance","Aamir Khan has performed at his best. Loved the movie.Ajay Singh Rathod (Aamir Khan) is a honest officer who hates the criminals and terrorist. He loves his country. He gets some information about criminals who are involve in supply of arms in order to create terrorism.Ajay solves this mystery and reaches the root of this gang. But at the end he comes to know that this terrorism was under-supervision of his very good friend and singer "Gulfam Hassan (Naseeruddin Shah)" The story, Music, Dialogues, everything is just perfect.A MUST SEE" 
" Indian cinema needs more of these!!","When I watched this movie, I was expecting yet another action flick with a decent storyline. I was in for a surprise. A great movie with some realistic scenes and an excellent story, this is probably the best action movie in a long time in India.In a country that has been target of terror, it is not uncommon that weapons like AK-47 are smuggled deep into the heart of it. Veeran, a tribal leader wreaks havoc by looting and killing civilians. Mumbai Crime Branch takes the case up and discovers that there are links at every level leading to the enemy government. The tribal leader, the local goon with illegal businesses (Bala Thakur), the weapons' supplier (Sultan), the middleman (Haji), the smuggler on the border (Mirchi Seth) and a Pakistani military official. This chain of evil poses a threat to the nation. The film also touches sensitive subjects like the loyalty of the common Indian Muslim towards the state, the mentality of the people who have suffered the partition of India, friendship and loyalty etc.Aamir Khan does a splendid job as Ajay Singh Rathore, the patriotic cop previously a victim of terrorism who vows to fight them. All the aforementioned actors did a good job, but the surprise package in the movie is Naseeruddin Shah. He is probably the best actor in the country at the moment and one can say, looking at this role why. He is brilliant as Gulfam Hassan, the singer born in India and brought up in Pakistan.A great movie with a good story and excellent performances.9/10" 
" Good Story..","The movie haunts you long after watching it also. John Mathew Matthan did a fair job for a débutant. The story of a sincere police officer in Mumbai crime branch is just a front end for many other stories like love, friendship, patriotism, religion and bigotry etc.Aamir Khan made excellent cop in Mumbai police. But, the character of Inspector Salim is the most impressive in the movie.A must watch for all those movie buffs as this has been a very genuine effort to show what is happening across the Indo-Pak border. What made this film a different experience is the genuinity in the script.A must watch for every one out there. This will not disappoint you in any way. 9/10 from me." 
" One of the best and most inspiring Indian movie","When i viewed this movie for the first time i thought OK lets watch another action movie with some common story.But since then i have watched this movie nearly 20 times and still i like it even more. The best thing about this movie is that it does not glorify the image of terrorists and cops.It shows how a common man can give his contribution to the society.Every thing from the direction to editing and acting and music,both songs and background is top class.It is the first movie directed by John Mathew Matthan but it looks like a very experienced direction.Performances by Aamir Khan,Naseeruddin Shah,Sonali Bendre and Mukesh Rishi are of top quality.The pace of the movie is very fast which makes it more adorable.The scene between Aamir Khan and Mukesh Rishi are the best part of the movie.A must watch for everyone irrespective of the age bars." 
" Just that movie which won't ever bore you","Now its the movie which turned my love for Amer movies into an obsession.."There are certain things that you do in your life, which at the end of the day make you proud, For Amir SARFAROSH is one such thing for him"Its songs are near to perfection....ACTING WISE amir was at his very best, and RISHI(inspector salim) was fantastic..sonali looked desperately beautiful in that mini skirt... Even though every dialogue in this film are well knit ,but that one dialogue (when salim comes to amir to complain about people chastising him for letting a criminal go) salim: "kya yeh desh mera nahin hai"rathore:" shayad nahin hai"is the best....End is also a cliff hanger...one of the best i have ever came across.." 
" Favourite Aamir Khan movie","I am big fan of Aamir Khan and this is my favourite movie of his. It is a superb film, very well made. An intelligent film but still a commercial one which I like. Aamir Khan is a joy to watch. You can tell with some actors when they are trying hard to portray their characters it makes you enjoy the movie even more. There are several scenes I enjoy in the movie. I love the scene where he is at the hospital and he is reading a newspaper when one of the villains appears and tries to bribe and threaten him. When he jumps from the chair and on to the villain it gives you a bit of a jump! I also love the dialogue between the Aamir Khan and Mukesh Rishi when he tells he tells him his purpose of joining the police force. Definitely a film to watch if you crave an intelligent film." 
" A Very Realistic Movie featuring Most Realistic Performances.","Sarfarosh is the story of a man, Ajay Singh Rathod(Aamir Khan). His journey in the world we think we know,yet there is conspiracy everywhere, there are many things unknown. Ajay is a normal youth, he lives a life of every youngster in India until, one day his brother is killed by the terrorists, his father is beaten up ruthlessly. Why? Because they had the courage to say the truth, to stand up for it.Ajay Singh later begins his career as Police Officer. The honest, sincere police officer, whose duty is his life, whose only motive is to protect law and see that the law punishes the criminals. An International crime, or Inter-Country crime, source is Pakistan, and Ajay has to find the root of the problem which starts at smuggling and ends at war, terror war from ISI(Pakistan Intelligence Agency).Coming to Performances:Aamir Khan as Ajay Singh Rathod is simply mind blowing in a hard hitting, sincere cop role. This has to be one of the very Realistic performances ever. You become so involved with this character of Ajay that you will feel emotionally attached to him. Director John Mathew Matthan direction is spot on, and the pace of the movie is well maintained, except for some time in the middle of the movie where you feel that film is being dragged. But for a debut this movie has to be a great achievement.Other Departments: Naseeruddin Shah is impressive as a Singer cum Terrorist. Sonali Bindre is lovely. Music is good, but one wonders if the Songs were a necessity. Action scenes are well shot.On the whole this film deserves to be used as a Prototype for Cop/Terrorism-based movies. Watch it, you will be satisfied." 
" ACP Rathore trying to capture the whole arms supply connections. He is also a very big fan of Gulfam Hasan and when he finds out that Gulfam hasan is one of the key person in supplying arms, the story begins","As usual, Amir Khan is best. But well here the direction, story, screenplay, dialogue are as good as he is. It's John Matthan's first film, but its just amazing and fantastic to watch. Nasiruddin Shah and Mukesh Rishi are unforgettable in the movie. Sonali Bendre doesn't have much to do, but she has done her part well.Music score and the lyrics are very good. Specially "Hoshwalon ko khabar kya" is an all time favourite. It's a MUST see."
