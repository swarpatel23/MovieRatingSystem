" nice to watch","full mark movie. best so far in this year. all go and watch. movie is all about money chase which has been picturised in a very interesting manner. all the actors have done very well. its a nice attenpt a debutant director and full marks for him and first time producer for coming up with such a nice movie. if you have not seen it you are missing something. UTT pataang is a thriller film with comic tinge and has been treated very cleverly by director and so it becomes a must watch movie. these type of low budget movie must be reconginzed by all. these types of movies will gain momentem slowly but steadily and since the budget is small most of people take time to know about the movie and once know nwill be hit." 
" Exactly made as per its title.","The year 2010 gave us some superb small films which in turn were responsible to raise my expectations from UTT PATAANG. Moreover its talented star cast lead by Vinay Pathak (in double role), Saurabh Shukla, Mona Singh, Mahie Gill and Sanjay Mishra was enough to excite offbeat movie lovers like myself to a large extent. In all a first time attempt by director Srikanth V. Velagaleti showed some great promise even without any noticeable promotions before its release.But unfortunately this time we don't get a polished gem in the disguise of a small film as seen in the previous year. Despite of having a talented cast ensemble and interesting script UTT PATAANG only manages to impress its viewers in parts and fails to emerge as a winner all together. Rightly made as a song less film with a short duration, the film does hold your attention in some particular sequences but overall it cannot be called as a thoroughly entertaining thriller cum comedy. Revolving around a one night storyline written around a bag full of money, the film talks about only few people and their mutual interactions, showcasing the elements of lust, love, greed and crime in their contrasting characters. Incidentally we have seen many movies in the past written around a bag full of money like Ek Chalis Ki Local, Sankat City, Emotional Atyachaar and more. Ignoring this fact the major problem in UTT PATAANG comes in the first 15 minutes itself where the proceedings are pretty slow and uninteresting which really put you off. In other words, its takes too much time to sink in which does bring in some kind of restlessness in the viewers. But once all the characters and their individual link ups are clear, the film starts entertaining but that too in only bits and parts.To be precise, all the confusions created in the first half get cleared post intermission. But the second half has another big problem of over- acting by the veteran actor Vinay Pathak in his double role of a Gangster loving French style and language. As I see it, his all one liner gags, histrionics and dialogues with French accent fall flat completely and do not entertain. In fact, I strongly feel that if conceived in a different and better manner, this double role of Vinay could have easily been the major highlight of the film post interval. In this second part though the story moves pretty fast but still the life saving entertaining moments only come towards the climax where another corrupt police officer enters to taste the part of the cake. Truly speaking the final moments once again save the movie and you don't get up from your seat completely disheartened.So overall it's a very bumpy ride with steep lows and not so big highs. No doubt the script is written thoughtfully by Saurabh Shukla and Srikanth, focusing on many interlinked sequences which get repeated from different perspective of a new character each time. But in my opinion this particular style of story-telling is now becoming over-used, especially in such small budget experimental movies. Last time I remember seeing the same kind of scripting in "Emotional Atyachaar" which was also released in the previous year. Anyway, in the cinematography department the film gets the right feel as required accompanied by a complimenting background score by Sanjoy Chowdhary.Performance wise, Vinay Pathak does both good as well as bad in this movie. As a simple common man he is great as usual but as a French obsessed Gangster he does it a little over and fails to entertain. Saurabh Shukla as his detective friend is superb but again he is getting typed in these kind of roles seen in several films. Mona Singh in his limited scope does well. But Mahie Gill sizzles on the screen in all her revealing dresses like a hot sexy-siren in the role of a con-woman. Though she hasn't got much to do other than giving uncaring looks and stares, but still she looks stunning and surprises a lot after her last small cameo in DABANGG. And the girl really deserves much better roles to prove her inner talent. In the rest of the cast Sanjay Mishra gets wasted whereas Delnaaz Paul, Murli Sharma and Brijendra Kala are strictly routineAll together, UTT PATAANG can only partly impress the viewers who like to watch offbeat thriller films made in this particular style. But for the rest, it might be synonym to its title i.e. UTT PATAANG." 
" Intelligently Done!","Srikanth V. Velagaleti delivers a surprisingly intelligent comedy-thriller with 'Utt Pattaang', that is nicely written & executed. Its amusing but also engaging!'Utt Pattaang' Synopsis: A man & his private-detective friend attempt to deal with a bitter ex-girlfriend & a missing bag full of cash.'Utt Pattaang' has a super first-hour, as the thriller unfolds beautifully. The second-hour is slightly problematic, as the pace drops, however, an interesting culmination, brightens the mood. The Screenplay is definitely filled with merit. However, the second-hour lacks sharpness & also the pace should have been kept in check. Srikanth V. Velagaleti's Direction is perfect. Cinematography & Editing are standard.Performance-Wise: Vinay Pathak dominates the show with a stellar performance. The under-rated actor enacts dual roles with effortless ease. Saurabh Shukla is another scene-stealer. He stands on his own with a solid performance. Mahie Gill looks hot & oozes confidence. Mona Singh is good. Sanjay Mishra, Brijendra Kala & Murli Sharma are adequate.On the whole, 'Utt Pattaang' is much better than expected." 
" Utt Pataang only name is enough","Utt Pataang is a movie which deals with comedy and crime genre.But as we start watching movie then it seems partial comedy and crime.Movie is about a person Vinay Pathak and his friend Saurabh Shukla.Vinay Pathak's girlfriend leave him because she love another guy but interesting another guy has same face as Vinay Pathak has.Vinay Pathak's girlfriend steal money from another guy(a double role of Vinay Pathak)but she puts the bag full with money in Vinay Pathak's apartment. But by mistake another girl takes that bag instead of her bag.Then Vinay Pathak(double role) try to recover his money from girl.Story level is as simple as possible but presented in complex way.That mean in first half audience is unknown from "what's happening and why happening".After interval audience realize that there is nothing in story level.Vinay Pathak is expected lot such as in Bheja Fry comedy and Saurabh Shukla is as usual as he is. after all it's below average movie." 
" Not for Indians","This film is unique, interesting, has a different story and the acting is decent...It's not for the Indian audience and I found it to be boring...We want masala, entertainment, action, comedy, good songs, dancing...Who wants to pay for crap like this? It's a boring film meant for the so called "Intellecual" but people in India just want to have fun. Films Like Dabanng, Houseful, tees maar khan and YAMLA PAGALA DEEWANA! Those are quality films that work in India... Why is bollywood trying to be like Hollywood? We don't want anything with "depth" whatever that means...We just want ENTERTAINMENT. That's what we pay for...All these films, udaan, dhobi ghat, lsd...They are not for us...Bring back the old love stories and msala flms!" 
" The idea works, not the execution","Utt Pataang is a comedy thriller involving five characters all at cross roads and in search of a big dream. Hero Vinay Pathak, his private detective friend Saurabh Shukla, a heart broken Mona Singh, a French obsessed gangster Vinay Pathak in a double role and his companion Mahie Gill.It is about how all is fair when it comes to money and nobody has a morality issue getting trapped in a dangerous game for that one big opportunity.What works about the film: is primarily the idea even though we have seen such stories in the past.What also works is next door face Vinay Pathak entertain you in a double role.What does not work: is that one is getting a little tired of the innumerable small budget films devoid of stars and glamour.Granted that the film has sparkling moments but to expect to be engaged watching just Vinay Pathak for two hours is a bit too much."
