" Vivek Oberoi THE BEST","Good movie Vivek Oberoi was too good as Maya Dollas ..All have done good job but end was predictable. Sanjay Dutt as a cop was good .e Ganpat song was catchy from Mika ,end could have been better.i watched it at least 5 times now i have became fan of Vivek Oberoi. award winning performance by him.Tushar Kapoor for the first time did a good job as a gangster (bhua). The best scene of the movie when Fattu returns.small role of Abhishek Bachchan but he did great job too. Amitabh Bachchan is always good.comparing with shootout at Wadala this movie was much better because of Vivek Oberoi. john Abraham's performance was average in that movie. I am waiting for more Vivek Oberoi's movies." 
" Thrilling & exciting","A brilliantly made movie from the White Feathers Films Production. A must watch for all action movie lovers. Based on the real incident of the 1992 firing at Lokhandwala Complex in Andheri in India. There were certain Factual Errors in the movie however it is a gr8 cinematic experience. All the stars have portrayed their characters brilliantly. Sanjay Dutt as Shamsher Singh & Vivek Oberoi as Maya Dolas are outstanding. Suniel as Kaviraj Patil & Tushar as Dilip Buwa gave a fantastic performance. The movie was highly under-rated due to excess violence which is not a regular in Hindi Movies There were certain parts which were included just to increase the length of the movie. However the exiting climax covered up all the flaws.................. All in all a brilliant movie." 
" Not for the Faint Hearted","By its very definition, a rumour is termed as hearsay or gossip. Shootout at Lokhandwala goes with the tag line - based on true rumours - which is quite humorous to begin with.But the humour ends here, since the plot revolves around the ATS (Anti Terrorist Squad) of Mumbai Police, headed by Shamsher Khan (Sanjay Dutt) and his lieutenants Kaviraj (Sunil Shetty) and Javed Shaikh (Arbaaz Khan). Their philosophy is simple: get rid of all the hoodlums in the Mumbai underworld and made it a safer place. They prefer to put a bullet in their brain rather than get involved with paperwork that follows an arrest.Their nemesis comes with the name Maya Bhai (Vivek Oberoi) and his cohorts Buva (Tusshar Kapoor), RC (Shabbir Ahluwalia), Fattu (Ronit Roy), and 2 others who I am not familiar with.So you could guess the rest with cops v/s robbers battling each other. Till finally the gang gets cornered at a flat in Lokhandwala and good prevails over evil.You have heard all this before than why watch the flick? To its credit, the movie spins a common script with slick editing, camera-work and pulsating background score. Sanjay Dutt puts in an honest performance while Vivek Oberoi plays the bad guy well. There is nothing else to write home about the rest. Songs are OK, and the 'Arre Ganpat,' with its catchy rap beat will definitely find its followers.What the movie lacks in soul, it makes up with its pace. For those who liked gangster flicks like Satya and Company, should watch this one since it will definitely appeal.For the rest who prefer drama, romance and comedy, steer away since the gore might make you lose your appetite." 
" Excellent, Fantastic and Superb","Shootout at Lokhandwala is a fantastic movie that is full of violence. The movie has many famous actors all in one movie. Amitabh Bachchan stars in a small role as the lawyer who is listening to what has happened. Abishek is in a 2 minute scene and both father son give a standard performance. Sanjay Dutt the main lead of this film gives a good performance as the Police officer. Sunil Shetty and Arbaaz Khan give decent performances as Police officers. Tusshar Kapoor is great as a gangster, and he even improves on his childish voice. The star of this movie has to be Vivek Oberoi who has delivers a Superb performance an Maya the deadly gangster. The film has many other actresses like Amrita Singh who did a good job as the hot headed mother. Aarti Chabria looks sexy in the song and I would like to play with that jism of hers like Tusshar does. Neha looks pretty kaash mein suhaag raat karta us ki saat." 
" Best gangster film","This is superb and highly recommended for gangster movie lovers Storyline is engaging screenplay is amusing editing is best direction leaves a impact Songs are blockbuster Sanjay dutt is amazing Vivek oberoi does a stellar performance as the main antagonist Tusshar is good arbaaz is superb Sunil steals the show Amitabh is superb abhishek is good in his guest appearance rohit does well other did excellent 8/10 This movie belongs to Vivek" 
" Based on True Tumors","Directed by Apporva Lakhia, Shootout at Lokhandwala is another of those movies where the bad guys look good, and glorification of the villains are in bright limelight. The movie was fast paced and will keep you seated throughout the gun fires, blood baths and murderous killings. The only thing that dragged was the song sequences. The songs in themselves are good but I would have really wished they were not there at all. They should have done an Extended or Director's Uncut or Song Enhanced versions of DVDs. That way, people will still watch the movie and many will buy the DVDs, thus making more money for the film.On that fateful day of 1991, at one of the Mumbai's sprawling sub-urban place (Lokhandwala), 5 gangsters were relaxing and counting their extortion money. The gangsters were led by Maya Dolas who had begun to rebel against Dawood Ibahim. Informations of their hide-out reached the then ACP Aftab Ahmed Khan, who brought in a platoon of about 300 odd Mumbai Police force to squash them. What followed is one of the most memorable shootout that every happened in Mumbai. The police fired uncountable rounds of bullets and the Maya led gangsters retaliated too. Eventually, all the 5 gangsters were killed and few policemen were hurt.Vivek Oberoi in the role of Maya Dolas was frighteningly awesome. I don't really felt any importance given to the other 4 members of the gang. They seem to have been randomly picked to fill in the spots. Of course, Tushar Kapoor (who played the role of Dilip Buva) was there with the next important role after Vivek, thanks to his sister Ektaa Kapoor (the K lady of the idiot box). He tried his best, I guess, but his acting sucks like a monkey who just found some zoo visitors to entertain with its banana tricks. Why don't he moved in to his sister's serial, he can do much better job there and we don't have to really bear him in movies (at least for us who detest the TV serials). Tushar had never been good in any roles not only in his first negative role in this movie. His only slightly commendable role is playing the dumb guy in Golmaal: Fun Unlimited.The remaining 3 don't really remind you of anything unless you've been glued and try to remember each and every scenes. Yes, yes, the ghost-seeing thingy of Rc (Shabbir Ahluwalia) after he shot a family by mistake. The shooting incident of Fattu (Rohit Roy), the day he earned the named Fattu when he finally was able to do a bang-bang-kill-kill. And the others, I don't remember them to link to any typical characteristics.Seasoned Cop and counter terrorists specialist, Aftab Ahmed Khan (Sanjay Dutt) chased and encounter Khalistani extremists, handpicked cops Inspector Kaviraj Patil (Sunil Shetty) and Constable Javed Shaikh (Arbaaz Khan) to fight against the girth of many terrorists in Mumbai during his hay days. Khan and his team took care of the Maya gang when the gangsters made extortions a buzzword in the early 90's. The movies shows Khan and his trusted Anti Terrorists Squad (ATS) doing many daring encounters; so much involved in their activities that they jeopardise their personal and private life.Btw, the real Aftab Ahmed Khan appeared in a cameo in the movie, playing the role of S. Ramamurthy, his former boss and the then Police Commissioner." 
" Hell of a shootout","An amazing film that is based on true rumours although most films that are based on actual events are crap. Shootout at Lokhandwala was so well written & directed and had riveting performances from a first-rate cast, every actor did a fantastic job even Amitabh & Abhishek Bachchan in their special appearances. I never heard about the incident before and I don't know if it's true or not but the film is made so dark & sinister that gives the tensive mood also it is emotionally & psychologically thrilling, the whole movie is charged with pulse pounding suspense and seems like it's really happening. A Sanjay Gupta film but the director is Apoorva Lakhia the one who made Ek Ajnabee which was also good that's why I wanted to watch the movie because both of them are terrific filmmakers and the title is eye catching. Overall it is just great how they managed to make a film on a very simple story about five criminals in a flat surrounded by hundreds of policemen. Just a few more words about the cast:AMITABH BACHCHAN: Simply the number 1 in Bollywood.SANJAY DUTT: One of my favourite actors.SUNIEL SHETTY: No matter what role he doe's action or romantic it will suit him.ARBAAZ KHAN: Good actor but hardly appears in any film.VIVEIK OBEROI: Did really well as a bad guy after Company.TUSSHAR KAPOOR: Good to see him in action after so many romantic roles.DIA MIRZA: Soooooooooo beautiful that I don't need to say anything else about her.NEHA DHUPIA: Her best performance will always be in Qayamat.ABHISHEK BACHCHAN: Doing really well now keep up the good work." 
" Another topnotch Sanjay Dutt starrer produced by Sanjay Gupta","I have watched this movie on its second night of release. Unlike other Sanjay Gupta films, i didn't think that this movie will be topnotch when compared to his previous films like Kaante (Brilliant), Musafir (Very Good), Zinda (Brilliant). The reasons being: The theme of the film did not quite appeal to me, making me think that the story would be told in a complete different way compared to Sanjay Gupta's storytelling. Hence, i still i was being optimistic because it is another Sanjay Gupta film, and has some of bollywood's prominent stars like Sanjay Dutt, Amitabh Bachchan and Suniel Shetty who act very well together in dark, violent films.Until Shootout At Lokhandwala was launched, i was totally unaware of the real life encounter that shook the nation in November 1991 in Mumbai. Therefore i went to the cinemas to get an insight on what exactly happened and how the mission was accomplished. Although i knew that the film is based on true rumours, i was expecting to see some real life incidents and some fictional that can be combined together to provide an entertaining edge-of-the-seat movie.A couple of reasons why i wanted to watch Shootout At Lokhandwala: 1. Sanjay Dutt is one of my favourite actors. This guy is just awesome when it comes to acting. I truly believe he is an all-rounder. Give him a gangster role, comedy role, romantic role, serious role - the guy does not let you down.2. Sanjay Gupta is a brilliant director. This guy has not let me down in any of his movies (except Plan - which had a shoddy script). His Kaante was a magnificent movie, Musafir was also very good, Aatish, Hameshaa can also be added to the list.3. Apoorva Lakhia's second movie, Ek Ajnabee, was very good (although it was an exact copy of Man On Fire). I feel that Apoorva Lakhia and Sanjay Gupta have similar interests on the types of films they choose, i.e. dark, violent thrillers - and therefore both Sanjay and Apoorva will work together to produce a quality product.My response to Shootout At Lokhandwala is very positive, in fact i thought it was an excellent movie that can be ranked amongst Sanjay Gupta's previous topnotch products (Kaante, Musafir and Zinda). The action sequences in this film are realistic and kept me at the edge of my seat. The storytelling by Apoorva Lakhia was brilliant, as he kept me attached to the screen without any confusing plots. Although Sanjay Gupta produced this film rather than directing it, you can tell that this movie is a Sanjay Gupta film because of it's dark, violent theme.Performance wise: Sanjay Dutt, as usual, is in complete form. If you thought he was excellent in Kaante, Zinda or Munnabhai MBBS, he is equally good in Shootout At Lokhandwala. He carries out an award winning performance, and you see him in a role which you have never seen him do before. No other actor could have replaced Sanjay Dutt. He is a guy that knows which films to sign for (especially the Sanjay Gupta ones) and acts to perfection.Vivek Oberoi is another actor to look out for. He does an outstanding job in this film as a gangster (representing Maya Dolas). His role is an extension to the role he played in 'Company', and suits the role to perfection. To be honest Vivek Oberoi is better off doing serious/ gangster roles than romantic or comedy where he completely sucks.Suniel Shetty is brilliant in this movie, working as Sanjay Dutt's sidekick police officer. His dialogues, humour, fight sequences and tough cop style suited him to perfection. Why don't't we see more of you in those type of roles, Suniel? The rest of the cast can be rated as: Amitabh Bachchan (Wonderful), Tusshar Kapoor (Very Good) - but he hasn't got the look of a gangster, someone else could have replaced him. Arbaaz Khan (Very Good), Amrita Singh (Wonderful), Dia Mirza (Good), Aarti Chhabria (looks pretty and does an able job), Neha Dhupia (Fair).Overall, if you like Sanjay Gupta and Apoorva Lakhia films, this one is for you. Another great film from th stylish director and producer combo. This film is also a must for Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty and Vivek Oberoi fans." 
" A few things spoiled this movie for me!!!","Before watching this movie i made sure i checked out IMDb as to what the other users feel about this movie.I found most of them unsatisfied..but i was confident i would not be.And i went ahead with the movie....i still don't understand whats my final say on Shootout!!!!At some places it was really good like fattu returning back to the hideout(u know wen) and the scene at the restaurant b/w sanjay dutt and obroi.But some others were like Oh-my-god-gimme-a-break!!! Has'not the slow walk shot been already shown numerous times,especially in Kaante???Then why use the same technique here,only god knows,or better the director knows.Another totally comic scene is when Buva says "teri maa ki"...i was on the floor clutching my tummy.Amitabh is pretty cool as the lawyer and so are vivek obroi & sanjay dutt!!!They keep this film from falling flat.And can someone explain why there is still 4-5 songs in movies like this??one or two songs are bearable.But the bhai's breaking into a jig then and there had me skipping the entire movie.The Verdict::: I gave 6 for Big B,Sanjai and Obroi alone..else it might have been 3 or 4!!!!" 
" A very good movie with an excellent star-cast...","The star-cast is awesome. Which is one major factor for the success of such movies. All the big and bad boys of Indian cinema with a background image of guns hurling "dirty harry" actalikes. Shoot to kill seems apt for a frequently used dialouge by Sanjay Dutt who appears absolutely stunning, specially to most women with that over masculine, overflowing testrostrone attitude of his and his typical walk with a swagger makes certain women feel week in the knees.Abhishek though has a smaller role.. but doesn't diasppoint. Viviek (i guess thats how he spells it) could have done a little better with the same company attitude being copy pasted. Rohit, shabbir, Tussher (or whatever the spelling is) have done a fair job. Shetty was at his best cop performance and Salmans brother should take body building as a profession than acting. Amitabh bachchan has a role... or does he? but i guess the big guy does a good job even at that little role he had in the movie as well...He is the Big B... and he proves it again and again.Overall a nice movie... lot of guns... lot of attitude... should watch once..." 
" Surprisingly violent...even given the subject matter.","In some ways, "Shootout at Lokhandwala" is typical of many Bollywood films. Even thought it's about gangsters and terrorists, these killers take time out for huge song and dance numbers! I really don't think these worked very well considering the subject matter in this film. However, in another way the movie is very unusual. It is one of the most violent Indian films I have seen--with a few particularly grisly deaths (such as seeing a close up of a woman being run over). In this sense, it certainly isn't typical!The film is based on actual real life events--so to some degree it had to be violent. After all, the thugs were horrible and violent people--there's no denying that. And, the ultimate showdown between them and the police DID result in a long standoff during which more than 1500 shots were fired! So, making it non-violent wouldn't have worked...though the film doesn't shy away from violence in the least. It's not a film to show small kids, that's for sure.As for the quality of the film, it's quite nice. The acting is fine and it was unusual to see Amitabh Bachchan playing a cop who is at times difficult to like. But the film, despite being exciting and well acted does occasionally degenerate into macho theatrics-- especially during the big finale--though I must admit that the cigarette scene and the coat rack was amazingly cool. Overall, it's a film best for folks who want a lot of action and killing. It might seem a strange film to folks outside India, as its end justifying the means angle is unusual to say the least." 
" Amitabh blows your mind","It's a fast gripping movie with brilliant performances.Both Sanjay Dutt and Vivek Oberoi slip into their roles perfectly as if they were born for it.Loved Sanjay's style.The last 30 to 40 minutes of the movie is the soul of the movie. It is very well executed. You find yourself in dilemma of with who your sympathies lie, good guys or bad guys, and for me that is well achieved result for the director.What I absolutely hated in the movie are songs, they are just boring with a capital B. However the screenplay and every actors performances make up for it.I am absolutely giving the extra 1 point for Amitabh. He has a very little role but very impactful. I simply loved his attitude, confidence, sarcasm and authority he interrogated the policemen with." 
" Nicely Rendered!","So they are making a sequel & I watched the prequel first to have that flow. I am impressed by Apoorva Lakhia & Sanjay Gupta for creating a very good thriller plot. Do not listen to these IMDb board members, they seriously despise Bollywood movies.Set in the 90s, the drama involving gangsters & Mumbai Police is a very fine watch and when it reaches the crescendo, the enjoyment triples. Performances are great by the whole cast & specially by Vivek Oberoi. Music is chunky & screenplay is amazing with special mention to the scene where it all the gangsters are involved with different policemen. Simply superb!If you are a die-hard action fan, go for it, because this one has cylinder explosions, gun fires & RPG.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity: Strong | Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Infinity | Gore: Infinity | Smoking: Strong | Alcohol: Critical | Drugs: No | Vulgarity: Mild Traumatizing Factor: Critical" 
" almost fantastic!","Based on True events leading to the famous encounters at lokhandwala in 1991, Shootout at lokhandwala is a gritty, macho & very commercial portrayal of events that took place leading to the encounters.Sanjay Dutt plays ACP Shamsher Khan who was charged with working for Dawood Ebrahim, the movie lets you decide whether that indeed was the case, Sanju puts in a bravura performance, hes never been cooler. Vivek Oberoi as Gangster Maya Dolas is also fantastic, great to see the lad back in form, he reworks the magic of "chandu" from company. Suneil shetty & arbaaz khan are both also first rate as sanjus sidekicks.The real weakness of the movie lies in the rest of the gangsters especially Tushar Kapoor, cmon no ones ever going to take him seriously as a Bhai?! There are 3 Mujra songs which further slow down proceedings, but having said that Shoout out at Lokhandwala is a fantastic Commercial thriller, i give it an 8." 
" Shoot Out at Lokhandwala (2007)","Shoot Out at Lokhandwala (2007)Director: Apoorva Lakhia Writers: Apoorva Lakhia Suresh NairShoot Out At Lokhandwala , directed by Apporva Lakhia , seems to be perfectly successful in :a) Casting big names in Bollywood Film Industry(Amitab &Abhishek, duo, Sunil Shetty, Sanjay Dutt, Neha Dhupia, Arbaz Khan, Tushar Kapoor, Vivek Oberio, Rohit Roy .. IS ANY ONE STILL LEFT OUT in BOOLY WOOD after this???b) Violence show c) Shoot out and police firingUnfortunately what it missed out perhaps completely is a) Any story base b) Music c) Character roles d) Simple movie making common sense & Logic e) Justification of any role to anyoneIts up to the pity audience what they prefer to see at last???This film right from the beginning tries to project that entire story is based on some real fact, though its begin with the old Sikh Terrorism in Punjab, still the director completely missed out to carry the theme till the end. From terrorism by Punjab extremist to cheap road side Mumbai Supari killing.. all seems to be mixed and jumbled out completely the Apporva Lakhia, perhaps he and his team of script writer really never read and re-checked their own script even once ! all the whole they may be too busy with the unsuccessful effort to bring all big stars together rather than making the movie of any sense at all. Its really funny when it between he tries to show the incident and their description with year and dates etc.. ! those useless details can easily be omitted and the story line may be made more worth .Its crazy that Abhishek Bacchant tries to fight the AK47 carrying Sikh Terrorist with a single barrel pistol !!! and the poor chap gets killed! What the director wanted to prove??? And he does proves in the entire movie that in spite of full battalion of forces and police officers, with all the man-power and all, the ultimate decision is made again and again by the 1960 style hand to hand fighting !!!!!!! dam crazy nonsense !!The DCP and ACP of police has to go all by themselves to the culprits and fight with their hand ! whats the rest of the police force doing then??? And Sanjay Dutt enters the hideout in the last scene to make the fight , as if he is going to meet his waiting girl-friend !! instead of re-checking his (again note) Pistol, he sets his hair OK ! and enters the hideout !!! Is that anything worst direction than these???The Mumbai don who claims huge amounts as Supari from each business tycoons don't have even a cell phone??? Can you believe this,, so at the last scene the director makes each of the gang member to talk to their family using a land phone!!!! And that too the connection of the phone line is intact even when he showed about 5-10 minutes of severe shooting in that house by the Police just before that!!! Come-on Apoorva ! this is real kiddish!!!And so on , one after another plots are all severely faulty with absolutely no logic and common sense. Underworld kingpin Vivek Oberoi mom is so poor(even though her son makes so much money from Supari) that she was shown in ragged and she need to go all the way to a public booth to call her son???Amitabh was as usual over acted , and was really painful. Director in-between tried to justify the sentiments of the killers and tried to project them with humane value.. please if you don't know to direct films, that's your problems but please don't convey wrong message at all to the society. When Vivek Oberoi and Tushar Kapoor(Tussar was an absolute bogus selection for that role , he is too chocolate looking for that role!!) comes and threatens the colony peoples in one scene , then while going back they just for nothing , just like that shoots 2-3 innocent peoples , just for making some fear !! if that's is justified , what's the point in showing their sentiments at the end??The movie in a nutshell is absolutely scrape, the name of Lokhandwala shooting is absolutely misnomer with the entire movie scenes. Police force in India are shown to carry old rifles ! not even a AK47 was shown by even one officers!! And hand to hand fighting seems to be the ultimate decisive factor for the game !! There is no script at all ! to comment , and music doesn't exist. Acting was just too ordinary and many a place useless and misfit. There is no need to show the rich Urdu verse spoken Arbazz Khan trying to make Sunil Shetty make understand to propose someone! It's NOT NEEDED at all.Macho man Sunil Shetty cannot able to overcome the slim and medium built Tushar Kappoor! Gangsters visit the home of the police officers and threaten their families and just go away even when they know that these same officers are behind them! DOES THAT HAPPENS IN REALITY !! what Apoorva wants to show! How novel and great at those underworld peoples!! Anyway this film is an ideal example of " how worst can a film be made" which in spite of all great Bollywood actors and actress doesn't even has anything to give.. no message no lesson, no scene, no justification, no truth, no music and sure NO LOGIC and worst direction.Please don't make movies like this, there are better job that can be done, and all you need is to THINK , of course using your BRAIN!!" 
" Vivek Bro, you did "The Best" in this Movie.. Awesomely Amazing.","I did disliked many of your titles, a reviewer I am.
But this was completely against, including 2-3 more movies (I might review later someday).
People should learn from you "Yet another Angry Young Man" but that era is fading..Sanjay Dutt yet another amazing act in movie.
You both hit the scene..Lol, I search IMDB for best and Google.Amazon etc. has the same.. :)"
