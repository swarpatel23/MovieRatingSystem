" Engrossing","Saw Paanch at Osian's at Siri Fort Audi no 4 in 2003..hop and skip distance from my erstwhile home.I,along with others in the Audi witnessed something that could and should have changed the landscape of Indian cinema had it released in its stipulated period.Period!As the opening credits rolled I started to feel overwhelmed by the visuals..expectation began to rise.It had been a long time that so much of effort had gone into the start of a movie.It sets the tone for what is to come.This movie is real and still not in your face.The characters,dialogues and scheme of things are so spontaneous that you start to think yourself being a part of the film/scheme/plot as a mute character/spectator.Lets talk about the characters/actors:Luke(K.K. Menon): I have no words to describe him.One actually can see the Devil/Lucifer/Belial in him in certain scenes (Esp Bus and Conductor).He manages to do it so much panache.That fleeting madness in Luke makes you gawk at him with sheer disbelief.Murgi(Aditya Shrivastav):Brilliant silent performance.He talks away the cake at times from KK and Vijay Maurya(Pondi).Such restrained performance is hard to find.What talent!!Pondi(Vijay MAurya): Amazing timing.I am actually tired of eulogizing every actor and character but cannot help but they are so frigggin good.Joy(Joy Augustine) has his own style and does bring a different dimension to the movie with his presence.I like Shiuli's role (Tejaswini)..very strong character portrayal.This movie deserves to be seen by all.It should see light of the day!! Had the movie been made at this day and age,we could have witnessed mayhem,carnage,silence,evil,ideology,mania,spontaneity,reality...in best ever celluloid form till date.Must Watch(8.5/10)" 
" The hidden diamond in Mr.Kashyap's CV","I had heard so much about this movie for the last 5-6 years that I thought this would be a letdown. Usually over-hyped movies are such that you feel that you were letdown by it. I finally got hold of it and I can say that Paanch is arguably one of the best crime thrillers the Hindi film industry has produced. I cannot fathom the reason why the government would ban this, (probably because this movie would attain cult status and dissuade the youth of today to smoke and drink and waste their time....) but in this movie we have one of the greatest acting performance by an actor, one of the best soundtracks ever made in the history of Bollywood, and one helluva movie. The movie theme will remind you of Requiem for a Dream, Trainspotting, only Paanch has a thriller plot apart from based on the systematic destruction of human morals.The plot is fairly simple. Its about 5 people who are struggling musicians. They play at nightclubs and concerts for cheap cash, but most of it is spent on marijuana, drugs and booze. They are all college dropouts and have almost no connections with their relatives. They live under one roof, practice in a vacant garage of one of their friends(their only friend!!). The movie continues at leisurely pace until they have an idea to kidnap their friend and ask for a fat ransom from his rich dad. But all goes haywire when one of them in a fit of rage kills their friend. Things turn for the worse when to cover up one murder they go on a killing spree. In the end, all five of them are behind bars, and in a gradual degradation of all morals.This movie, if and when it comes out will primarily be remembered for the immensely powerful acting performance of one Kay Kay Menon. His performance is bound to remind you of Brad Pitt in Fight Club as the legendary Tyler Dyrden. K.K's music will make you take a jacket and go out to the nearest music store and buy the Original Soundtrack of this movie ASAP!! Paanch is the movie where one can say Bollywood came of age and we had proper rock music. There are only three songs in the movie, one a bluesy track "Kya din kya raat" one that will remind you of the classic jazz of the 40's, the psychedelic themed "Tu Jaa Maat" meant to remind you Cobain and the rock track "Khuda ke Liye" which will remind you of "Rock On!!" only it was 5 years earlier.. Even The Doors' "Roadhouse Blues" was an awesome addition!!! The acting performances have been superb. Kay Kay Menon was brilliant as "Luke" as I mentioned earlier, and he has been brilliantly supported by the very impressive Aditya Srivastava as "Murgi", Joy Fernandes as "Joy" and Vijay Maurya as the hilarious "Pondy" Even Tejaswini Kolhapure as "Shiuli" the only chick in the movie does a decent job. Sharat Saxena is also impressive in his short role as the Police Inspector.Lastly, Mr.Anurag Kashyap!!! This was his very first attempt behind the camera. It was his brainchild. He being the producer and writer as well. But kudos to the man, for giving us yet another cinematic pleasure. Thank you sir, and I hope you make more of similar movies and keep us people who are fans of non-mainstream movies satisfied.A truly well deserved 10/10 !!!" 
" Astounding Crime Thriller","I saw Anurag Kashyap's Paanch at the Cinefan Film Festival, 2002. It was clearly one of the best movies of the festival, on par with movies like Hero and Osama.The story depicts what ambition, immorality, greed and angst, unmistakably the products of urban life, can do to an ordinary person. A little mischief for the sake of success leads a group of 5 wannabe rock stars to get entangled in a gory web of murder and betrayal.What follows is a shocking thriller of a story, supported aptly by some great performances, the best coming from Kay Kay Menon and Tejaswini Kolhapure. The movie has a great musical score by Vishal Bhardwaj. The songs, most of which Kashyap interestingly uses up in the first 15 minutes, are brilliant. So is the background music. Another high point of the movie is the cinematography, which impresses upon the viewer an aura of fast-paced urbanity juxtaposed with dark, ruthless bloodshed. If there's a low point in the movie, it is the few minutes after the interval where which seem ineffective and dragged. However, they are easily outweighed by the compelling tension and gloom that permeate the movie.Clever, brilliant, yet utterly pessimistic, Paanch is strongly recommended.
7.5/10" 
" Dark movie - much before 'Kaminey', rock music - much before 'Rock On'. Certainly ahead of its times!","Almost all films stale out if the release is delayed by few months... forget years. Anurag Kashyup's Paanch is one of the strongest exceptions on the list. This film delayed by almost a decade is still so effective, most importantly because its narrative is timeless and was also ahead of its times making it relevant and entertaining even today.Much before Bollywood had seen any Kaminey, Paanch was one of the first 'dark' and intense films from India and absolutely effective. Drugs, smoke, alcohol, abuse, expletives, kidnap, murder, body butchering, heavy metal rock music, dark lightening in scenes, sexual undertones in dialogues, crime thriller genre, noir treatment, erratic lyrics and much more - and none of this simply forced to make the film look pretentiously dark.The narrative is unambiguous yet not predictable for a moment. 5 people (4 guys and 1 girl) get involved in a kidnap which leads to murder and the more they try to get out of it, the more they get trapped in it. The 5 people setting reminded of Mahabharat's Draupadi and the Paanch Pandavs (through here there was 1 guy less). There is also a subtle reference to Draupadi in a scene where Kay Kay asks Tejaswini to wear a longer sari - 'Sadi lambi pehna kar Draupadi' (the word Draupadi was muted by censor in the preview copy) - Interestingly in this scene there are 5 guys with the additional one being the one to be subsequently kidnapped (Pankaj Saraswat).All the characters are negative and Kashyup develops each of them so distinctly. Even his approach to writing and directing every scene is absolutely innovative with the characters behaving unpredictably and the situations changing spontaneously. The characters are so unusual to Bollywood screen but so true to real life. You might have surely encountered one or the other character prototypes in real life in your college, workplace or home. One is a coward (Vijay Maurya), one is silent spectator (Aditya Srivastava), one is partner in crime (Joy Fernandes).The performances are BRILLIANT. Without a doubt this is Kay Kay Menon's career best performance till date. He is so much into the character of a hot-headed perpetrator who vents out his frustration on anybody and everybody in the team that at times you literally feel a part of the cast who are bogged down by his constant bossing and bullying on the gang. Even when he sings a rock song, he is so much into the act that you feel he's performing for a live audience. Another gem of a discovery of this film was Vijay Maurya (who by now has become popular for his roles in Black Friday (as Dawood) and Mumbai Meri Jaan). Maurya plays his part so perfectly that you actually feel pity for his character's cowardice. Aditya Narayan and Joy Fernandes are good. It's sad that an actress as amazing as Tejaswini Kolhapure got lost never to come back in a proper role in Hindi films.It's surprising that Censors kept the film on hold considering some of today's Hindi films have more expletives than Paanch. Actually the censor wasn't as evolved then as it is today. That's what makes the film ahead of its times. Now the film is seemingly approved by the Censors but is perhaps stuck due to producer problems. However there is not even a single smooch or even kissing scene in the film forget any sexual intimacy.Music is one factor that Anurag Kashyap never ever gets wrong with. While we always talk of filmmakers like Subhash Ghai, Yash Chopra or Sanjay Leela Bhansali to have a good music sense that reflects in their films, Anurag Kashyap has always had superlative and path-breaking musical score in all his films (though he is grossly underrated for it) and has a 100% perfect track record. Whether its Indian Ocean in Black Friday, Amit Trivedi in Dev.D or Piyush Mishra in Gulaal, all his films had refreshingly NEW and very good music. Paanch is no exception with Vishal Bhardwaj (in his early days as a composer) who composed some tunes which were traditionally not Bollywood but very interesting.Some of the most effective scenes from the films are when - Kay Kay and Maurya get into a fight over switching off the stereo, - when Kay Kay scares Joy for a moment saying 'Kya main Joker dikhta hoon' (supposedly a tribute to Martin Scorcese's Goodfellas), - when Kay Kay faces Inspector Deshpande (Sharat Saxena) for the first time and almost every other scene.The film brought into light the rock culture (much before the ROCK ON happened), had a subtle reference to a human body butchering scene (which has now become a cliché in crime dramas), had a noir treatment when the genre was still in its nascent stage in Bollywood. Again, ahead of its times... or would you call trend-setting!However the film is not flawless. The epilogue added to the crime drama in the last 15 minutes is clearly stretched and perhaps the only predictable portion of the plot. The twist in the tale that it intends to create almost falls flat. Also an item number was the worst way to end an otherwise original and entertaining film. Plus the footnote added at the end of the film as a moral-of-the-story (perhaps forced by the Censors) which reads 'Crime Never Pays' absolutely kills the noir effect of the film. Nevertheless the film is so gripping barring this slack ending that you easily excuse that blemish and enjoy Paanch as one of India's cult-classic crime dramas." 
" A distinctive and classic debut film","There are hardly any films that stand the test of a year these days, let alone 8 years. Paanch was shot in 2000, but has yet to see a mainstream release in India due to strange business problems (which continue complicating the world rather than simplifying it). There may be cinematic moments in Paanch that have been replicated in later (and far lesser) films, but the whole here is far greater than the sum of its parts. And that whole is driven by a tone of seething intensity that is too individual, too real, to not be the author's personal voice. Films with personal voices are rare in these times, and that is what makes the film special. Whether Paanch is seen now, or 10 years later, it is this tone that will always give it a distinctive voice.Despite not having a remarkable plot or even a thought-provoking narrative thrust, and despite a few (no doubt, forced) nods to commercial viability, the film's visceral energy still gives it a very compelling quality. The performances are almost uniformly excellent, and the "realness" of atmosphere can make you smell and taste the time and place  qualities Hindi cinema badly needs to incorporate in its thought process.This is not a film about music or musicians, but about dark mindsets in people who happen to be musicians. The music (with very distinctive Indian rock songs  Vishal Bharadwaj and Abbas Tyrewala at their best) is just a backdrop but it has a force that makes you forget that it is just a small plot point in the overall scheme of things.The director of Paanch  Anurag Kashyap, has moved on with a highly accomplished film (Black Friday) and a very personal one (No Smoking), but Paanch will always be special for the new voice that emerged in 2000. Whenever the film is seen." 
" superb crime thriller - one of the best to come out of Hindi cinema","Saw this film at Asian film festival 2003 and loved it ... The film is about 5 struggling rock band- Luke(Kay Kay), Joy(Fernandes), Murgi(Aditya ), Shulia(Tejaswini Kolhapuri), PornD(Vijay Maurya). Their struggles, frustrations, dreams,delirious illusions etc etc. Everything boils down to the need of money. Yes they need it and desperately.Luke is the undisputed, uncontrollable loose cannon leader of the band, Guitar and Gaanja for him !!! Joy has a fetish of food and trusts Luke implicitly. Absolute loyal. Somewhat of a 'chamcha' PornD is the butt of all jokes, thanks to his crush on Shulia. Always at logger heads with Luke. What u call a 'phattu' Shulia - dates more men than the number of handkerchiefs u might have lost in your life Murgi is a friend of Luke somewhere in between PornD and Joy. A very realistic skeptical guy who acts as a catalyst between the two diametrically oppositesThey plan a kidnap heist ..and then things snowball into ransom - rage killing - serial killings - escapes - mistrusts- self doubts - near insanity !!!And yes the film isn't predictableThe dialogs are profane, and yes it is a more profane/real 'Dil Chahta Hai'. "Franz Kafka, Van Gogh, Michelangalo were unrecognized geniuses in their life. Recognise me !!" - Luke's graffiti Half the time I was either laughing or being overawed by the lines. The scenes are organic and the lines flow seamlessly. As a morbid-crime-psycho-thriller film, it got me hooked. Yes clearly, this is no fantasy,romance, 'feel good' film.However, midway through the story, a possible weak point comes. I couldn't understand the point of the guys breaking into the house, robbing and catering to their baser instincts, and started eating food from the fridge and listening to music. Yes, they are doing this after they have robbed the house.Actually, I don't need to, because many of such serial killers are known to be 'trigger happy' and impulsive. I know it doesn't make sense when u see it on screen, but when i look back, "Everything needn't have logic". I agree. That scene seemed an obvious reference to A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick's disturbing film What I love the most in the film is the dynamic relationship between the 5 characters. How their equations change during the turn of events. How each one reacts to another differently as the film progresses. And yet it is organic and perfectly believable. You might have met these characters somewhere in your real life. If the characters of 'DCH' are real, then the characters of Paanch are 'realer' !!! At least, I could identify more with them more than Sid,Aakash or Sam. I'm not saying DCH is bad or trying to compare Paanch versus DCH. I'm just talking from the screen writing craft point of view. Performances - Kay Kay (Luke) and Vijay Maurya(PornD) are BRILLIANT .. TOO FRIGGIN BRILLIANT. Had the film been released back then, Kay Kay would've become a 'method acting' star and not an 'method actor' . In fact so much so that the role Kay Kay plays almost is surreal and yes there are shades of Kay Kay being an imaginary alter ego almost like Tyler Durden meant. Tragic !!!Vijay Maurya is the dark horse in the film. He is a cringer, a insecure coward-creep who cannot stand up for himself. He is the bullied one in the class,office, college anywhere. A real life character You might have met him almost everywhere. Tragic that this actor is still not renowned.Joy performs well. Tejaswini Kolhapuri is at times slightly irritating ..especially in her monologues. Aditya Srivastava deserves a special mention.Music and lyrics are WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!! Indian rock songs  Vishal Bhardwaj had explored into perhaps an uncharted territory and Abbas Tyrewala has written the best lyrics of his life i guess. 'Tamas' and "Khuda Hoon Main" are gut wrenching .... "Paka Mat", "Kya Din Kya Raat" are colloquial unlike any other Bollywood filmy songThe film does rock. A noir film .. cult film. even though it may look a little dated, it is a must see. This film should have been released in India in 2000 after completion, but ran into troubles due to censor issues and producer issues i guess ... since then it has not been released in theaters... This film still has a chance at the Box Office. if you are into crime films, and realism then this film is highly recommended. rating - 4/5" 
" grass + lust + blood + greed + music = rock n roll","Prompted me to chip in after the ROCK ON!! "euphoria". A film I saw at the at Osians in 2003. A film made way-back..an underground fav. Though a envy worthy status for a film to be loved and sought after even in it's unreleased state.it's been long and it needs to be out in the open. What if we never got to watch Fight Club or Old Boy ever and just were privy to the downsized Indian Censor friendly Sanjay Gupta's Zinda and what if the only Fight Club I knew was Vicky Malhotra or Chopra or whatever's Zayed Khan starrer Fuzz Club? I would dread it if censors all over the world kept a film in limbo for their own immaturity and stunted growth process. And now that it's cleared what are the producers upto? Is it a medical product to have an expiry. Will it lose it's value?For me Paanch still looks fresh and dark/morbid/stark/gritty and this is the movie which patented Anurag Kashyap's neon fetish. When the first poster of Alwyn Kalicharan was released in the TOI some years back..it read "This Winter Think Neon"15 fps shots...time transitions.....great music....VIJAY MAURYA is awesome....as usually towering over the expected SHOW STEALERS....KK and Aditya Srivastav......who are GREAT anyways....the problem is they are so good....you know they are gonna blow you...so you expect it....awesome music......Abbas Tyrewala's legendary "TAMAS" lyrics...they still manage to haunt me......IT'S ABOUT ROCK.and there is ROCK..they dope....they swearthey scratch armpits.they want a better life.Luke wants to be recognizedever worshipedand music is a let outa let out for angst/love/lust/greed and unfulfilled dreams and not just a Sunday relief in their plush Malabar Hill penthouse. A film which gives me the choice to explore or feel for the lesser evil than the GOOD v/s BAD routine or is PAANCH about EVIL v/s BAD ASS EVIL. How often do we have that on screen? ONE OF THE BEST TITLE SEQUENCE....ONE WHICH YOU WILL REMEMBER....AFTER SEVEN WHICH HAD A SIMILAR GRUNGY FEEL TO IT.....I LOVED THIS ONE.....PLUS THE CITY CAPTURED IN IT'S PSYCHEDELIC GLORY. Paanch needs a wider platform to be seen..to be loved/hated/criticized/debated on." 
" A gem.....A inspirational..... A underrated work","There is may be.. not may be but definitely wrong with me or with the censor board who did not given certification to this movie,though i just finished watching the preview copy of this movie after downloading from torrent.i don't know why i took that much time or years... to watch this movie but never the less this movie still got it freshness after 9 years.so what went wrong why this movie did got released and question remain unanswered even after that time period or so. while watching this movie it reminds me of another exceptionally well picture which recently released called shaitan because that movie shaitan has a shadow of this paanch really i find the glimpse of that in that paanch so when shaitan can get a certification why not this one.about paanch what can i say. Kay Kay menon rocks man! and so the other star cast really they all together pulled out the great job.and after seeing this one can really say that why anurag kashyap is been known as the one of the most talented director of recent times because he given one of the best work almost 9 or 10 years ago and still its not been appreciated or given credit for masterpiece which hes has created long ago.as far as songs are concerned Vishal bhardwaj and abbas done once again they have know for uniqueness and freshness because still this kind of work is very rare though there are few like amit trivedi in Dev.d but again there is anurag kashyap again..editing and cinematography are also the strong parts of the movie and which in whole this movies is truly or nearly a masterpiece......I feel good i have seen a such kind work before it get theatrical released but on the other had i feel sorry the movie lovers for not got chance to see. and to be honest censor board is been biased to this movie." 
" A breakthrough for Hindu Cinema!!","At the outset, it'd be in order to mention that this is the well-known theatrically unreleased film that was in the news (in 2003 and afterwards) over the ethical exceptions that the Censor Board of India had taken to it while denying it permission to release. It held that the film "glorifies violence; it shows the modus operandi of a crime (killing of a police officer); it shows excessive use of drugs; it has double meaning dialogues (with sexual undertones); it has no positive characters; it does not carry a social message".That episode resulted in further intensification of the lasting antagonism that marked (and continues to mark) the relationship between iconoclastic brigands of Indian cinema (with director Anurag Kashyap at the vanguard) and the government-appointed sentinels of public morality who run the Censor Board. It was primarily through p2p torrent networks and file-hosting sites like Dingora that 'Paanch' trickled into the audiovisual precincts of movie aficionados and elicited reactions that spanned the spectrum from disturbing/disgusting to captivating/thrilling. It has since then developed a sort of cult following among fans of the 'psychological thriller' genre.The movie itself is a story of unapologetic evilness and unfettered debauchery and most of all a psychological revelation that unfolds as a chaotic sequence of events in the entangled lives of five individuals... who live on the fringes of social morality and discover (with delight) in violent sadomasochistic self-destruction an accessible means of self-realization.In giving up, treacherous step by treacherous step, the social fiction of goodness and embracing ruinous crime they discover a seductive freedom of the soul a primal condition that allowed for (and indeed drew forth) a most authentic, albeit disturbing, response to the fact of existence in a hostile world of urban ambitions, transient fame and chronic estrangement. The protagonist of the movie (Luke - played by KK Menon) is one of the most convincingly frightening and psychologically well-constructed characters in all of Hindi cinema. The script is cogently carried forward by the development, definition and motivation of this character. The plot consists essentially of Luke's psycho-socio-pathology and his domination of the will of the four other characters a domination that eventually sucked all of them into a spiral of heinous crime and moral degenartion that kept their existences constantly hinged on the edge of egregious bloodshed (and frequently precipitated the same). To think that the times they had together as drug-stealing socially-shunned impecunious musicians were the actually the best they ever had is to betray some sign of how dark their lives were. Amongst the secondary characters, of particular note is Shuile (played by Tejaswini Kohlapure) who discovers a taste for evil most serendipitously but goes on to unhesistantly accommodate seduction, manipulation, intrigue and cunning in her repertory of sin.I have to say though, the denouement of the drama suffers a debutant directors' capitulation in face of the conventional need to impose a closure on a story that might have been better left open-ended. The movie ends on note which is somewhat redemptive and life-affirming but mostly a clear reflection of the makers' desistance to sink further into the dark recesses of human psyche which have otherwise been prodigiously explored more intrepidly than ever before in modern Hindi cinema. Anurag Kashyap is genius. He employs the visual medium in its fullness and enhances the cinematic literacy of the viewer. The soundtrack is awesome too. A gem of a flick that ought to have released theatrically and celebrated for its contribution to the coming of age of Hindi cinema.(see the original review at http://www.voxmentis.com/search/label/Movie%20Review )" 
" Watch it for KAY KAY","Saw it finally, after a long long wait. It is an engaging piece but not a path breaking, shattering one as I found in some other reviews before the Internet preview release.My points, Cinematography and Art direction right from credits to last frame (i would combine these as they gave the whole feeling) are splendid capturing the entire feel of youth's agony, their ambitions, their fear and the entire feeling of being locked up in a room or a garage or in a police station (claustrophobic feeling). The outdoors are though minimal and not extravagant, they are done with finesse. No green scenery's here and no sunset sunrise scenes. Yet they are captivating enough to endear, enthrall and to transform into the world of these characters.Editing, nope that's one thing I felt is not up to the mark, the reason may be that its the director's and editor's first movie and a sharper scissor was needed. The scenes I would like to cut are 1) The end song in which the girl sings same one as she has sung earlier 2) The scene in which Luke strangles Nikhil's father (this was later communicated in dialogue) 3) The scene where Pondy and Joy are shown as being taken to Jail (this was later communicated in dialogue). Thus felt like these were like spoon feeding. Acting of Kay Kay as Luke Morrison is just awesome and equally appreciable is that of Vijay Maurya as Pondy. I did not like the acting of Tejaswini, I felt she just sleep walked. Background music is apt 3 songs are great. Main Khuda, Baith Jaa, Akhiyan. Vishal Bharadwaj gave an awesome sound track and thanks to him.Now, the thing to writing, the dialogues are wonderful "Aye Pondy Chaai Piyega, Chal Mere Liye Ek Banaa" reveals the domineering attitude of Luke and so is each dialogue relevant to the characterization.The script has made me ask some questions to myself and some questions to the writer director Anurag, 1) If the entire confession in police station was about money then police at any point did not seem to be interested in where the money that was stolen was kept and all they were interested is why were the murder's that took place happen. 2) Was it necessary for Joy to have the other guys waiting outside Nikhil's house after they stole the money they wanted? He was just eating and these guys went in and when they found that Nikhil's father was there, they just strangled him. Without this also it would have been done as how the police came to know about murder of Nikhil's father and kidnap of Nikhil was not shown anyways and that was not the point of movie also. 3) The most disappointing thing was that Luke who was shown as if he was drowned just comes alive. This seemed to be a twist and this made the movie predictable as to who shall have the final laugh. And there in lay the antagonist of a wonderful script.Direction no doubt is superb. But what started as a very very interesting and psychological thing with each shade of a character being revealed poignantly. What started as a very interesting and psychological movie turned out to be a thriller kind where the ending was predictable and so called commercial. Yet its one thing that should be watched out to know what a angry young man does (for KAY KAY).Watch it for KAY KAY 3/5" 
" Crime never pays",""Crime never pays" - that is basically the moral of this film.Also - Avoid bad company.The story is about 5 members of a rock band with a female and male vocalist who are involved in drugs, sex,smoke and the like. The lead man is crazy and addicted and goes to any extent to achieve what he wants. Soon all band members get involved in robbery and murder, with the cops at their heels. The rest of the film tells what happens to them.The film concept is good. Music is awesome, especially for rte rock genre fans. Acting is good on part of all actors.But it is too explicit and unsuited for kids.You can watch the film, if you don't mind the explicit stuf and foul language. It's worth." 
" Something You Don't See In Bollywood Everyday","i watched this movie toaday . and it was hilarious . Anurag Kashyap did a great work It is his debut movieThe style of the movie is very good . this is not like some masala movies of bollywood . the plot of the movie is very goodMovie is well written and directedEdited is good . music and background score is f..ng awesome . all is rock music . in 2003 who expect that ?this is a completely dark movie . i have watched many Hollywood movies i am glad that there are people in India which have talent and do same workall the actors did good job .

F.ck them .Anurag Kashyap one of my best man from Indian cinema , he told in his directional debut movie what is he capable ofHe wrote and directed the movie .i am happy :)" 
" Dramatic Paanch","paanch is a story of five different character.KK Manon play a lead role and done a fantastic acting ,AK is one of the best writer who have guts to show the reality .anyways guys i must recommend to watch this movie ,lets discuss star castLuke(K.K. Menon): I have no words to describe him.One actually can see the Devil/Lucifer/Belial in him in certain scenes (Esp Bus and Conductor).He manages to do it so much panache.That fleeting madness in Luke makes you gawk at him with sheer disbelief.Murgi(Aditya Shrivastav):Brilliant silent performance.He talks away the cake at times from KK and Vijay Maurya(Pondi).Such restrained performance is hard to find.What talent!!Pondi(Vijay MAurya): Amazing timing.I am actually tired of eulogizing every actor and character but cannot help but they are so frigging good.Joy(Joy Augustine) has his own style and does bring a different dimension to the movie with his presence.I like Shiuli's role (Tejaswini)..very strong character portrayal."

" paanch is the word...","It was only after i watched 'dev d' and 'gulaal' that i felt an inner urge to watch 'Paanch',the movie which never got to see the light of the day despite being in controversy all this while but for all the wrong reasons.The way Anurag showed the inner turmoil of the male protagonists and unconventional portrayal of women in both the aforementioned movies I was pretty much sure that the movie has something different to offer and boy was i right,Bombay never looked so dark and grim as has been shown in the movie right from the opening credits till the end.Paanch is a story of five youths including a girl in the form of a not-so-well-to-do rock band which goes by the name of 'parasites'.All down and out on their luck they hatch a plan to kidnap one of their friends who is not a part of the band and ask for the ransom from his rich dad.The plan goes awry and so does their fate,it is only after that we get to witness the destructive mentality of today's youth who want to go to any length to get their dreams fulfilled.Band's lead singer and guitarist is Luke played by Kay Kay Menon, a maniac in his own way and a control-freak with megalomaniac aspirations.The scene where Luke says "baap hoon main sabka" says it all.Aggression and frustration takes a whole new meaning when Luke beats his friend to death with an iron rod.joy played by joy is OK but that doesn't bother you much.Abhishek Shrivastav played his own calm self in 'murgi'.the surprise package of the movie is 'pondi and 'shiuli' played by Vijay Maurya and Tejaswani Kolhapure respectively.Paanch takes you to those dark corners of human psyche where a normal being has least likely to have visited before.Dark,disturbing,destructive,grim and real are the five words to describe Paanch in the best way.A must watch.i would give it an 8.5/10." 
" Killer Picture (Possible Spoilers)","Jiyo kashyap jiyo..i was intrigued, impressed & surprised, all at the some time.. i had read some great reviews, it had a gigantic build up in my head, when finally i got to see it, i thought.. it might be a good movie, not that great as people say.. by the end, well.. lets just say.... it turned out to be superb...it has its drawbacks... its not perfect in every aspect.. then again, it was this dude's first movie... so, great great great attempt...highlight of the movie was KK.... this guy rocks... brilliant acting...a very distinct scene in the movie, a writing on the wall... van gogh, michelangelo & kafka were never recognized when they were alive.. they got their fame later, same indication is brought towards Luke (KK), but it looks more of a cry from the director to bring into everyones attention, that a genius is out there waiting to be recognised...the movie had its highs & lows, but i enjoyed it thoroughly.. specially the ending, which made me rethink the whole pic... thats what i loved most about it..i don't understand, why was this movie banned so harshly & was never able to reach the theatres.... what can one do, crap like this stops cinema to grow..do watch this excellent movie whenever it becomes possible for you to watch it.."
