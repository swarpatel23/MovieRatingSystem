" Barah Anna at IFFI","I was at IFFI last year. There were slew of films there. posters, banners, cut outs, etc. Barah Anna was one of those films, about which I could not read before the screening. but it was in Hindi So I just didn't think much before entering, I was alone watching this film, it started........and the way it started unfolding, man...Let me tell you its an absolute delight to watch Vijay Raj and Naseeruddin Shah together. I was like, ****, these two people together will do what not in the film and as the film proceeded further, I was right...... I was laughing and jumping in my seat like all others in the theatre, I was choked in tears at times and, I was feeling triumphant at times, damn.. so many feelings. At times I was laughing so much, in next seat there is this old woman looking continuously at me. I was like whats wrong, this film is doing what it is meant for. I had seen enough of tragic films and this film simply took me to the lighter side. Vijay Raj has outdone himself. He is the man to be watched. Even the slum girl..I liked her. The new actor is also good. He is there in "Luck By Chance" also. Naseeruddin Shah is keeping quite but his every expression is worth thousand words. Guys if you like a real cinema,the real characters and a genuine comedy, go and watch Barah Anna and please watch it in theatres, its a film to be watched in cinema-ghar. I am happy that end of the film was not the usual cliché. I wish I can make such films some day. Where do these guys get such ideas from?? OK..now..WATCH IT!! WATCH IT!! WATCH IT!!" 
" Entertaining and Dark comedy","It's a good film, there is a lot of comedy.I enjoyed a lot; the story was well structured and really good. It's a dark comedy, Vijay Rajperformance is good. This movie is of a different kind. There are very few Indian movies of this kind. It's one of the best films that will come out in 2009. The Direction is superb. The movie is entertaining from the beginning till the end It's a puzzle till the end and you never know what's going to happen next. The story is just unpredictable. We need more movies like this. If you want my recommendation then it's a must see movie for 2009." 
" This comedy has a script","Amazing picture, absolutely amazing, the part was awesome, the script obviously well done; the acting and the cast are incredible. I can't tell you how wonderful the movie was. The concept of the movie is very interesting. Nasheerudin Shah is a versatile actor, and one of my favourite actors. Time and again he proves that he can do better and better. The movie is extremely well made.It's a definitely must see for movie lovers. The storyline is very unique. I feel that the movie is well packaged in terms cinematography, direction, editing and execution. Raja Menon has done a brilliant job as debut director." 
" A light hearted entertainer with a social message.","Just happened to catch the premier at the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF-2009), and not to mention the presence of the legendary Naseeruddin himself and Director Raja Menon at the ocassion.The story of the movie is not so different than any other off-beat bollywood movie, but the direction impresses. The laughters never miss their slots. The pace of the movie is apt and well poised with the life stories of 3 men (who happen to share a room). The screenplay is intelligent and leaves an impact.Acting wise, Vijay Raaz takes away the applauds, as Naseer strangely isn't explored at all.Overall, surely worth a watch if you need some light hearted entertainment with a touch of class direction." 
" Awesome movie","The title of the movie was uninviting. So hesitatingly I started to watch it and oh boy...was it great. Yes it was very well made down to earth story in which all the characters have given a great performance. The agony and ecstasy of the characters was so well captured....especially Naseeruddin who spoke so little but turned out to be the central character. The ending was both classy and hilarious. It kept open the option to bring out a Part 2. But seeing how it was not a box office hit, I doubt if producers would sink money into a sequel. Like many have said in their reviews there is great scope to make such movies so let's hope the is one" 
" Huge Potential Cinema... Half Utilized. ♦ 67%","The plot is very binding, telling the story about three middle-class men trying hard to meet ends. It showcases the plight in a very sharp manner, but on the other hand gets monotony while doing so.The first 30 minutes fails to keep its viewers hooked, as it shows the prologue & introduces the character. Running for less than 100 minutes, it finds grip just before the intermission as is when the plot gets interesting. The climax is although implied, very good and the sole reason why I give it 6.7 out of 10.Naseeruddin Shah, I won't say was wasted, but was not utilized much. Vijay Raaz steals the limelight with Arjun Mathur. Supporting cast is supportive. Music is fine, so is the cinematography & setup. Direction is average. Narration is fine, but the whole experience could have been more intense, had the makers polished it. Average comedy-drama.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended, but nothing out-of-th-box here as we expect from independent movies.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: Mild; Beeped out | Nudity/Sex/Foreplay: No | Vulgarity: Mild | Violence: Strong | Gore: Mild | Alcohol/Smoking: Strong | Drugs: No" 
" well made film with gr8 performance","I watched it today
found it to be a good movie.Vijay Raj was outstanding.
naseeruddin shah had minimal dialogues which could have been improved but he is gr8 anyhow
Arjun mathur was good as well as typical struggerworth more than a watch" 
" great film... with one of the best script i had ever known...","Damn good... let me tell you one thing... if u really want to watch the movies with the best scripts... watch those with small actors like sanjay mishra, vinay pathak, vijay raaj, neha dhupia, rajat kapoor, abhay deol in lead role and specially the low budget movies. yeah... here... when i m talking about low budget films, i can't keep myself without suggesting this one-'kya delhi, kya lahor'. the whole film moves around a small hut and the requirments were 'three rifles and some wooden boxes'. these actors are the best in this field but not at the top because of the need of commercialization of films. the top actors n directors have the sole motive to make money by any means, at any cost. they don't think much about the script. moreover they make movies according to the demand of the actors, situation and public not according to the demand of the script. they can modify the scripts but not the other factors. recently i had participated in a debate under the topic 'hollywood is light years away from bollywood' the arguments were pretty surprising and the conclusion i could make as a result of the debate burst my head. If we have had make movies like 'barah aana', 'aankho dekhi', 'pappu can't dance saala', phas gaya re obama', 'dasvidaniya', 'purani jeans' etc with top bollywood actors like srk, aamir khan, akshay kumar, the hollywood would be no way arround the indian cinema. The movies couldn't make enough money and success because they couldn't make much people to watch them. even for 'barah aana' there are only 14 reviews since it was released(2009). 
ok i have talked much about the cinema stuffs. let me guide you about the movie now otherwise they will fire my review as you know that this is the world of commercialization, here 'they' don't make films instead the 'films' make them.12 aana is one of the best among all the films i have watched yet. during the 1 hr 35 minutes film nashruddin shah spoke nothing during first 1 hr and 17 minutes. i had thought he was dumb but i was wrong. he spoke, and when he spoke it just changed the scenario of the film. truly the weightage of each of his words are no less than thousand words. The movie depicts the tragedy the situations and complication of slum people. we meet with these type of people in our daily life, the watchman, the drivers, the waiters and we also know in the real world people like kidnappers, murderers, thieves also exist but we never bother to relate these two type of people. the latter is the result of the former. The ending of the film was outstanding it couldn't be any better. i just yelled when i noticed the reason of nashruddin shah laughing when he was caught. don't make me write everything. it's great. just watch it." 
" Agony of Urban Poor.....",""Barah Aana" revolves around few characters residing in the slums of India and pictures the poverty line below which people are delving in the urban areas of the country. The film features three main characters, who have migrated from the villages to support their families. One of them work as a watchman, and the rest of two are a driver and a waiter. The film delves into their hardship to meet the ends and their descend to kidnapping to fulfill their needs.Well, few films have dared to expose the ugly side of the urban life where characters cross their line against their honor just to meet the basic needs of life and go for theft, prostitution, and defrauding. Few such films I've seen include "Pet Pyar Aur Paap" from 80s and "Traffic Signal" from recent days. Just like those films, "Barah Aana" also portrays the reality of urban poverty and the anguishes and crimes the people living in slums go through. The specialty of the film is its story which unfolds interestingly and at times is hilarious and ends in a meddling end. Well, the film might not be of interest of everyone but it sure will remain in your mind for few days and leave you with a bitter sweet memories of people compelled to live under poverty and commit all sort of crimes just to meet their basic needs.Rating: 2 stars out of 4" 
" A charming tale, but short of great","Barah Anna is the story of three have-nots in Mumbai- A driver, abused and humiliated by employer's impatient wife (Naseeruddin Shah), a watchman who is pushover at work, and therefore in life (Vijay Raaz), and a waiter, young and ambitious (Arjun Mathur).The three live together, and despite their different approaches to life, are friends. Each leads a difficult life, an exercise in futility in their dead-end blue-collar jobs. Shah silently suffers the humiliation, Raaz wants some money to send for his family for his unwell child's treatment, and Arjun wants to impress and get-together with a frequent foreigner customer (Violante Placido). One day Raaz stumbles on to a crime, making way for extraordinary circumstances.Barah Aana is a study of the three characters, and the actors give an exemplary performance to establish the characters in flesh and blood. It tells you about how their characters and the motivations sway when they face challenging circumstances.The first half hour establishes the characters, their approach to life and the motivations. But post-intermission it drags and the direction meanders as the drama unfolds. You wait for the end, looking at the watch, 20 minutes before it actually ends, which is sad since the movie is just 97 minutes long.Watch the movie, however, for the exemplary performances. Naseeruddin Shah does not have any dialogues before the climax even though he has the maximum screen time. He carries it silently as only he can. Arjun Mathur, seen here after his Luck By Chance outing, impresses as the street-smart guy, with typical English and ambitions, without reducing the character to a mangled mess of caricature language and demeanors. Viloante Placido, as Arjun's object of affection, is subtle and composed. Tannistha Chatterjee, as the phone-booth owner, is believable and holds on to her own.The star of the movie, however, is Vijay Raaz. He gets into the skin of Yadav, and comes out with such a brilliant performance that you'll feel pity that you don't see much of this immense talent. Watch him when he transitions from being a pushover, to be assertive enough to challenge his employer, and moving from bidi and matches to cigarettes and lighter.Barah Aana is a short and simple story. It's a shame that debutant director Raja Menon does not deliver what he promises. The credible performances hold on this fort together, and make it a charming tale nonetheless." 
" Not a comedy","This movie could easily call itself the Indian Slumdog Millionaire  not only does it have Indian artistes, the makers are also Indian :) !! Having certain similarities with both Arvind Adiga's White Tiger and the runaway Danny Boyle success, Barah Aana is a story of three have-nots who are fed up of their wretched existence and decide to take matters into their own hands. Shukla (Naseeruddin Shah), Yadav (Vijay Raaz) and Aman (Arjun Mathur) share a room in one of Mumbai slums. They are simple, honest people struggling to eke out an existence in the city  Shukla is a driver for a businessman but he has a painful past, Yadav is a watchman in a building and Aman is a waiter in a Barista. But life isn't so forgiving - Shukla is constantly ridiculed and abused by his mistress, Yadav is being made to do double shifts and treated more like a peon, running errands all day and Aman harbours romantic dreams in his heart about the friendly Italian woman at his café.Things reach a critical point when Yadav's son at his village falls ill and he desperately needs money for the treatment  but his pleas fall on deaf ears. Desperation leads to an accidental crime and with it comes a realization that now they have a way to fight back the system for the dignity that they have been denied so far  The story has very interesting possibilities, and the acting is certainly top notch. Naseeruddin Shah has only 3 lines of dialogue in the entire movie, that too in the climax  he communicates only with his facial expressions and shrugs in the rest of the movie  and that itself is a study in acting !! Vijay Raaz is the most vocal among the three and he is good as usual. Amrit Mathur (the guy was Farhan's friend in Luck By Chance) does the aspiring young man role very well too. But I thought Tannishtha Chatterjee made the major impact in the small role of the phone-booth owner in the slum.However, the director fails in one very important aspect - to innovate in the movie. The script is completely linear and the pace doesn't vary at all. Sometime in the second half, I even started looking at my watch  even though the movie is just 100 min long ! The first 30 min is spent establishing the difficult lives of the three lead actors and the story then moves steadily towards the 'accident'  the plot is very guessable and the director doesn't do anything to dispel the disinterest once you realize you got the plot. The humour scenes are very few  and some more funny scenes might have improved the pacing of the story. The director, however has one big last laugh in the end  but that is not enough to redeem the movie. The plot was interesting, the acting flawless but Barah Aana is let down by a slightly unimaginative screenplay. Its not a bad movie, but just nothing special ..I regularly review movies at http://bisprad.blogspot.com" 
" Barah Aana....!!!","Written, produced and directed by Raja Menon, Barah Aana is a below average watch. The movie that claims to be a comic flick doesn't even come close to making you laugh and the maximum that you can probably do is to smile at a few scenes. I cannot believe the fact that an actor like Nasserudin Shah is wasted in this movie. Barah Aana's script is extremely ordinary and execution of it is where Raja Menon goes wrong. His way of story telling doesn't impress and it is sure to make you bored. This movie doesn't engage you for more than a stretch of 5 minutes at a time.Barah Aana is a story of three poor and simple individuals Shukla (Nasseruddin Shah), a car driver, Yadav (Vijay Raaz), a watchman in a housing society and Aman (Arjun Mathur), a waiter at a restaurant. All their lives change when they involve themselves into a crime accidentally committed by Yadav. Both Aman and Shukla find their reasons for committing the crime, may it be Shukla's grudge against the owner's wife or Aman's attempt to save his love. And how things lead up to the climax is for you to watch.Barah Aana is definitely a light comedy. A light comedy that makes you smile and nothing else. Barah Aana's soul are the actors in it. Vijay Raaz is the most impressive of the lot. He recreates the magic created by in him in Raghu Romeo (2003) that had him in the lead. He's funny and emotional. Arjun Mathur after petty roles in movies like Luck By Chance etc, gets a slightly important role in Barah Aana and he does justice to the role completely showing his potential. He's good in every part of the movie. The setback of Barah Aana is the execution of the script. It's way too ordinary to make an impact. Nasseruddin Shah goes totally unnoticed which is quite rare for the actor of his caliber.Barah Aana is a below average watch but not that bad after all.I'll go with 6 out of 10 for Raja Menon's Barah Aana. Thumbs down for wasting Nasseruddin Shah in the movie.Raghav Movie Critic, Writer's LoungeMore Reviews on: www.raghavthecritic.blogspot.com" 
" Not Bad Indian Kidnapping Caper","Just saw a promo of this movie a couple of weeks ago, so I decided to give it a watch. I have seen quite a few movies on the kidnapping genre and they have been pretty interestingly made. All movies from Fargo to Big Lebowski and Chaos have been different and enjoyable in their own unique way.Bollywood too has made some good movies too on this subject. This time round we have a short movie for a change from a debutant person by the name of Raja Menon. Surprisingly This guy has displayed that he is talented and can make a good movie. ***********************CONTAINS SPOILERS**************************** The main plot revolves around 3 down on luck guys who are scraping a living through their dead end jobs. Naseerudin Shah who incidentally seems to get all the best movie projects, is a chauffeur. He does not seem to speak until the end, for some reason which is unexplainable. Vijay Raaz is a watchman for a resident apartment complex. Again he delivers a brilliant performance which is just so amusing. In any movie he is amazing and really can make us laugh. The third guy who Is a newcomer is unemployed and strikes a unlikely friendship with a Italian girl who is a resident of Bombay. Her background is not what it seems however. They all are friends and eventually realise that earn a decent living more money is required. After falling in to the company of a unconscious man that Raaz beats up in a brawl, they find a solution to make lots of money. They decided to kidnap people off the streets and ask for ransom money.***************END OF SPOILERS*************** The movie initially upon viewing will not seem like anything groundbreaking or spectacular. But given the fact that it depicts real people, in real surroundings acting in a realistic manner, sets the movie apart from the trash that has come out of late. The first 30 mins or so gives the viewer an introduction to the basic characters however this seems to take longer than is required and we are left to wonder when the main plot will begin. This element really lets the film down. I also expected more meat in the plot as it was too simpler story to tell. The movie could have been more enjoyable if the script writer had implemented some twists and turns. Vijay Raaz is the main attraction of the movie. The man is a genius. His acting is fantastic every time. However I feel he does need to put more weight on. Nasserudin gets through his part effortlessly. But the surprising element in the movie is the Italian actress. She was a delight to watch. Which goes to show that international actors too can be part of Indian films, if they are given the right role.Overall if you are a fan of movies that belong to the kidnapping genre, this one is for you." 
" No Aana","'Barah Aana' tells the story of there friends (who are strangely three men of different generations) who are working ill-paid jobs that they hate and are desperate for something bigger and better, well, not necessarily better. Raj Kumar Gupta's screenplay does not really offer much. The pacing is decent at the beginning but it really slows down to lethargy. It's only 90 minutes but it felt much longer. Menon's story itself isn't that interesting to grab the viewer's attention and sustain it. The execution is pretty ordinary too but I liked the way the sets were designed. The plus point of 'Barah Aana' are the performances by the three leads: Naseeruddin Shah, Arjun Mathur and Vijay Raaz. These three lift the film above mediocrity but otherwise the film itself is very much forgettable." 
" Baarah Aana: 12 shades of life","Barah aana is a short film which depicts the life of 3 lower class individuals(Watchman, Waitor and a driver). However director was new but the way he has managed to get the foundation of the film is incredible. All the three lead actors Vijay Raaz, Naseeruddin shah and Arjun Mather has again shown that how to get into the skin of the character and make the audience feel their pain and trauma they are going though. It is their power packed performance which make the audience support them even in their sinister acts. And don't miss the spark of that new girl tinistha chatterjee...she is next deepti naval in making...But this spell bound was broken by the abrupt ending of the movie. I didn't understand why the director was in a hurry to end the movie in a 1 hour 25 minutes. The movie ends at nowhere and messed out all the charisma it has left on the audience. The titleof the movie was no way related to the story. Over all a sad movie in spite of brilliant performances.Overall: * * (Can see if you want to see good performance not a good movie)" 
" Slumdog saga continues....","This movie, though not as high profile as Slumdog Millionaire, has all the gradients of that movie and more - life in slums, Indian riches (Rs 2,000 for pizza but no money for poor watchman's sick child...), foreigners, government bureaucracy (person is alive but dead in government records)and so on.Barah Annah also has tight script and paces well - though could have been made shorter, and climax could have been handled better. No songs and dance - I wish move Bollywood could be like it. Movie is built around three characters - waiter, driver, and a watchman - and their struggles They hit upon a easy-money earning formula but...Naseer, as always, is great but real surprise is Vijay Raaj who is superb and subtle as watchman. Background score is another plus.Overall 2009 is turning out to be good year for Indian movies. Wish same was true for Indian stocks."
