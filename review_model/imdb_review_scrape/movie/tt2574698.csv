" Waste of time and money","The movie was probably aimed at being on of those a masala flicks with bromance, romance, song sequences, tragic background and what not. But half an hour into the movie and it all went for a toss due to a very very weak script. The on screen appearances of the actors was good but it wasn't really backed by any actual acting.The dialogues were over cheesy and ludicrous in all aspects. Probably Priyanka Chopra was the only watchable element of the movie (or may be I am being biased).Frankly an hour into the movie and i really felt like leaving (I don't know why i didn't). Trust me guys, its one of those movies which is meant to be forgotten and if you haven't watched it and are planning to, then forget the time and money that you are going to waste on this and just save yourself from the agony that might scar you.The only way this movie could be watchable is with a group of friends who are making fun of everything possible whilst the movie plays." 
" This film has started disaster in Bangladesh","I would like to introduce myself as one of the Bangladeshi movie lovers. Probably Gunday is getting great response in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Does the director understand that this project has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done this film.At the very beginning of your film,they are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think their script writer was plastered while writing the script. If their information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? India joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. India didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. Director can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. they showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in their film. It's tremendously humiliating for us (All Bangladeshis).3.According this story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!" 
" Worst movie and historically appropriate","One of the worst movie of recent times, with very rubbish historic info. Scriptwriter, director and production should be ashamed to so laughable scripts. How come they make this comedy and give all wrong information to public. You should not pay for this garbage and also should not waste your valuable time.This film was not only pathetically terrible, but also a story line that made no sense. The usual sarcastic one liners fell flat.I have to give this at least 1 star only cause I'm not allowed to give it less." 
" This movie changed the main history !","This movie changed the main history of the liberation war of Bangladesh  in 1971 against Pakistan. Shame Bollywood !Shame Yash Raj films !  Very poor story line. Lack of Historical knowledge. I think Bollywood  have no intelligent script writer now a days. And we can understand  that they are currently struggling in this matter.  Very poor costume selection as we can see the film is plotted on 1971  but their costume is more like 90's. For example Priyanka chopra  maintain tied fitting shirt & pant for the movie. That was ridiculous  !! Ha Ha Ha During 1971 How can a lady police wear that kind of props  LOl :p I afraid during that time was their any lady police (in  sub-continent) ? :/ How could people make this kind of junk!!   Bangladeshi fight for their country  and gain glorious victory during 1971. It was a war between Bangladesh  & India. Not India-Pakistan war." 
" Bollywood masala action film. Its not based on facts !","Its making money and thats the headline. Just a spoiled effort. Action and over-dramatic dialogues are its USP. Rest is just another Bollywood weekend movie.Bangladesh liberation war was modified as Indo-Pak war without giving proper exposure to facts. Bangladesh was born from the war between India and Pakistan ! Thats the terrible blunder. So any person who knows the facts will be disappointed. As we know from the previous review Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who declared the independence of Bangladesh in 26 March, 1971 and after that the war began between East and West Pakistan. East Pakistan later became Bangladesh, a sovereign state. Along with 90000 soldiers Pakistan army surrendered to the commander in chief of India and Bangladesh joint forces.The movie violated the sovereign feeling of Bangladeshi peoples. I'd rather prefer to watch "The Busturd Child" (2013) Hindi drama film directed by Mrityunjay Devvrat showing and emphasizing the real events that took place during 70's." 
" Misrepresentation of the history of 1971 Liberation War","It has misrepresented the history of 1971 liberation war which happened between freedom fighters of then east Pakistan who wanted a country of their own and Pakistan army where freedom fighters won the battle and BANGLADESH was born. Pakistan army killed 3 million people in Bangladesh. Of course then Indian govt. helped freedom fighters a lot and at the very end of the war, they sent their army to help freedom fighters on request of govt. of Bangladesh. But that doesn't mean the war was between India & Pakistan. Production house like Yash Raj Films should be more careful about this type of misrepresentation of well established history." 
" Wake Up Bollywood!!!! Plzzzzz","The one area where Bollywood has achieved excellence and perfection is publicity / promotion. The art of pre release promotion has taught them how to sell their even average / substandard productions at good profits. The much awaited, hyped and promoted "Gunday" is finally out in the theaters and yet again, net result is "Total Disappointment". The movie from head to toe lacks attraction in any field (Story, Music, Direction & even Acting).The handsome combo of Ranvir and Kapoor proved insufficient. Irfan Khan selected a B Grade movie and disappointed his fans. PC is continuously on the way to destruction with another flop appearance. The charisma of YRF and embodied cast could not bring desired results. Although film may achieve a good business (May touch the magical Figure of 100 Crores Club)but it can not be termed a movie to watch. The idea of late 80s once again failed. It is a wake up call. I mean how long audience can be fooled by exaggerated promos and publicity. At last, it will fall. So Wake Up!!!!" 
" It was Bangladesh's liberation war against Pakistan","The movie starts with a story line; "....Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrender on December 16 at the end of the Indo-Pak War". I strongly condemn this matter. It should be edited without any delay. Me & all the Bangladeshi people respect those Indians who sacrificed their lives in the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 and we remember the contribution of Indian govt. at that time. But it doesn't change the history. Bangladesh born in a long turmoil ending up a 9 month long war against Pakistan Army in 1971 but the liberation story starts far more from 1952 by language movement. India joined with their military forces in 3rd December 1971 and the Pakistan Army surrendered on 16th December 1971. Meanwhile India supported Bangladesh by restoring refugees, food, finance, arms and with many other things. This is movie review page where I am opposing one specific content of the movie which is terribly hurting an entire nation. Yash Raj films still didn't respond in this matter where as Bangladeshi's are strongly opposing it specially the youth society. The mindset should be changed and the history should not be presented wrongly through a movie." 
" I strongly protest this movie","I, as a Bangladeshi, strongly protest the film story. I know most of the film are fictional but we can't deny that movie do express a lot rather than anything. Whenever a fictional movie/series is made it comes with a disclaimer. This movie has mocked our liberation war which is the pride of our nation. As, a Bangladeshi I am still thankful to India that they helped us during the war, but that never give them any right to express it as their own battle. I wonder how the banner approved the movie! It should have been judged by a moral view. It insults our nation, our pride, our survival during the war. I protest it." 
" Worst Movie in the World History","Gunday is the worst movie in the world history, not only in this sub-contitent, but also in the entire globe. The producer and director should be severely taken to task for manipulating history. Is is shame on the part of the industry to have such a movie. There is no fact. The movie is completely based on false statement and information. Shame on you Bollywood. You should have some ethics at least. This is totally unexpected. When the whole world knows the fact, you are trying to modify it. No story, poor acting, and falsifying of facts. Really unexpected from Bollywood. Most surprisingly, I did not understand as to how the sensor board permitted to release this movie." 
" Protest: Misinterpreting the History of Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971","Dear Yashraj Films Authority, Greetings! I would like to introduce myself as one of the Bangladeshi movie lovers. You probably are getting great response for your new film Gunday in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your visitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you." 
" Illiterate and uneducated producer","How it feel if someone made a movie to prove that Hitler won the 2nd world war? I felt the same when I was watching this movie. It seems to me this movie was produced to spread wrong information about a country, may be producer hates that country. History manipulation & hate speeches is unacceptable.They also put lots of wrong information about a country which is pretty dumb, specially in the age of information anybody can google a bit to learn the basic things about a country. It seems to me that, this movie produced by some illiterate and uneducated people or may be they did it intentionally. Both are unacceptable.I wish I could give it negative rating." 
" Poor script reflecting stupidity of ignorant director and writer","Calcutta later Kolkata historically such a rich and old city was never known for only a bridge and gangster! It was the capital of the British India and known for many fine historical establishments; Fort William,Victoria Memorial,Howrah Bridge,Marble Palace, Dakesshar Temple are few examples of it! And if for great people of course for Tagore and Bose not some gangster!And when it comes to the history of Bangladesh; Bangladeshis were fighting this war since the beginning of the year 1971 and India got involved in December 1971. In history it is written as Indian army fought along side the Bengali freedom fighters.It is an utter nonsense and stupidity to portray such false impression of this great liberation war as an India-Pakistan war! From this perspective I review this movie as a very poor script movie." 
" Wrong history","They made a film, without knowing ( or by creating history by themselves ) history of the liberation war of Bangladesh. In the movie they showed the liberation war of Bangladesh was actually part of 3rd Indo-Pakistan war!!! The true history is that in the liberation war of Bangladesh India joined at the last moment to speed up the whole process. Also this movie represented a wrong image of the freedom fighters and the people of Bangladesh during 1971.There are no doubt that this movie misrepresented the history of Bangladesh during 1971.Most probably they doped themselves too much during script writing. This is a humiliation to the History of Bangladesh." 
" Disappointed","I was very interested in this movie after watching it's trailer. And especially because of the producer it was coming from. I know that, it is never wise or ethical to write a review after watching half of a movie; but I acknowledge that, I am doing that wrong thing now. Indian people have a lot of misconception about the history of Bangladesh. This is not very welcome, but this is understandable. Common people are not expected to have knowledge about the history of a foreign country. But when one of them is making a movie on that history. he simply can not do the same mistake. And from this well-known producer, this kind of negligence is never acceptable. The wrong history presented in this movie is definitely a punishable crime; and movie lovers, Do not believe a single word of this movie about the history of Indian subcontinent. Thanks." 
" Nothing but a bunch of lies in this movie.","You can't accept lies on your motherland and they did same on this movie. I can complete the entire movie as there are full of lies and useless information in this movie. They start the movie with a lie. They humiliates the Bangladeshis on this movie. Maker of Gunday should feel sorry for what they create. This is the poorest film from YashRajFilms. I can't tolerate this as a Bangladeshi. They marked us as a Hindi-speaking nation while my mother language is Bangla. We are the only nation gives blood for our mother tongue. I suggest all of you to know the real history : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_WarPeople of India should feel sorry to produce such an dumb and stop it immediately. To All Indians, Please stop Manipulating History of Bangladesh."
