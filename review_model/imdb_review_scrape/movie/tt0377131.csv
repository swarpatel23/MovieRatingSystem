" great, great, great and underestimated!","i saw this movie 2 years ago at the movie-festival in locarno and i was absolutely overwhelmed! the acting is great, maria goretti is a goddess and the dialogues, written by saurabh shukla, are one of the best dialogues ever written in a comedy!!! (watch out for the scene where raghu is watching his beloved show while his parents are talking to him...).if you like different movies that don't absolutely follow the unwritten Hollywood-rules like "american beauty", "the royal tennenbaums" or "garden state" you will certainly love this movie. give it a chance, you might be surprisedcongratulations and a big "thank you" to the makers of this great movie.10/10" 
" A Refreshing Unconventional Little Tragicomedy","Rajat Kapoor tells us the tale of Raghu, a humble waiter (Vijay Raaz)who's in love with Neetaji (the radiant Maria Goretti), a character from a soap opera. It's ironic that I just rewatched 'Nurse Betty' yesterday and the inspiration shows but the similarities pretty much end there as 'Raghu Romeo' remains its own film. Pritam is behind the music and there are a few ripped-off tracks but it's funny to see how that's presented.Vijay Raaz proves to be one of the funniest actors today. Having witnessed his comic performances in 'Monsoon Wedding', 'Pran Jaaye Par Shaan Na Jaye' and even 'Run' (him being the best thing in that movie). With 'Anwar' and 'Company' he's proving to be quite versatile too. He's the perfect choice for 'Raghu' as his unconventional looks and mannerisms only add to the character's genuineness. Saadiya Siddiqui's Sweety and Maria Goretti's Reshma provide the perfect contrast to Raghu. As Reshma, Goretti is a little hyper but that too proves to be an advantage as it contrasts well with her soap opera character 'Neeta'. It's great to see Siddiqui finally in a full-fledged role of the (unusual) heroine. Saurabh Shukla plays a hit-man who's hilariously in love with Sweety.Shukla's writing is commendable but there are a few plot holes. I've spotted about one or two but this does not bring down the entertainment value of the film and can be overlooked. I like how Rajat Kapoor tells uncommon stories about common people (e.g. 'Mixed Doubles' and 'Mithya') and as a director he does a pleasant job. This is especially evident in the last scene after an upset Raghu, sitting next to his indifferent mother, watches Neeta on television." 
" a must see..","This is a very good comedy movie with a satire on the current trends of Sas- bahu serials in India which have crippled the thinking of many people in the country. All the actors are from theater, so you see some good acting. Vijay Raaz is as good as ever. Maria Goretti is gorgeous and Saddiya Siddiqui looks cute.The dialogues are well written and they make you laugh.In all, an honest movie with lot of creative effort form Rajat kapoor as a director.If you are or if you know some one, addicted to Sas-bahu serials, this is a must see. My rating 10/10" 
" Excellent","Recently when I was in Bombay I had an invitation for the premier show of a unique movie "Raghu Romeo" and I appreciated it very much for this opportunity. Indeed Rajat Kapoor and his crew have done a superb job of putting together an outstanding cast that are not on the main stream of actors and actresses.  If it weren't for the superb directing ability of Mr. Rajat Kapoor, the movie couldn't be this successful.  It is an impressive performance in all!  I understand that Rajat and Saurabh Shukla wrote the story and the script. Congratulations to the film crew on winning the best film award at MAMI FILM FESTIVAL in India and many other awards abroad!  I couldn't believe that it is the first movie acting role for Maria Goretti whose performance was perfect as a TV anchor person with a smile on her beautiful face.  I will not be surprised if it makes the nomination for the Oscar and my best wishes to Rajat Kapoor and his cast.  Nonetheless, it was one of the best films I have seen in recent years!" 
" A satirical comedy on saas bahu serials.","Raghu Romeo I watched when I went to this video shop to hire a particular CD but couldn't get it. Instead of that, the person gave me this CD saying it is a wonderful movie. I wasn't very impressed with the CD but then I read the story behind the making of the movie. That impressed me so much that I watched the movie instantly.And that instant decision proved to be right. The movie is one of the best movies I have watched till date. The first film to be produced by 30 something peoples including Rajat Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah, NFDC etc.That was about 3 years ago. Vijay Raaz is at his best and same can be said about Sadia Siddique. This is a funny movie with some satire added to it. Raghu the protagonist of the movie has everything going against him. The only company of his is the favorite TV show that features Maria Goretti. He can't think of anything when he sees the movie. (Watchout when he cries watching the serial) He stays in a dream world where he believes all that happens in TV are real. All smiles, tears, violence etc. When Maria laughs, he laughs. When Maria cries, he cries. And when Maria cries for help he jumps to help her out. But are those tears real, are those feelings real. No. But Raghu thinks so.All my wishes to producers and directors like Rajat kapoor & Naseer." 
" Wow, This man is a real actor!","This movie is amazing, I mean these kind of movies will stun you. These people are real actors yeah, Vijay Raaz, Saurabh Shukla they are really amazing. Watch this movie and you will want to watch other movies of these actors" 
" Adorable","Though cinema ought to be the way it is in Raghu Romeo, it unfortunately isn't for the most. The movie is very lovable. Essentially, it takes a dig at fiction vs reality, and does it with a very mild tone. There's no preaching here.Vijay Razz is superlative in his role while Sadiya is cute and lovable. Maria is outstanding as both Neeta and Reshma while Saurabh is excellent as always. The tragic end that intersperses a fictional narrative into a real one is remarkable, and the lesson that Raghu learns from that twist takes the movie to a meaningful end.With no drama and utter realism, this movie is a must watch like any other Rajat Kapoor film. He surely knows to bring out the multidimensional quality even in our Hindi film characters for a relieving change."
