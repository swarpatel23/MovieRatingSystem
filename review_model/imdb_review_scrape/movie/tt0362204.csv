Ingredients: Four unusually nicknamed, pee-together friends who wanna earn easy money. · Aryan: who dreams of red Ferraris and Manhattan mansions. His other interests involve eve-teasing pregnant women and helping the same lady in labor towards the second half (don't ask the relevance of the pregnant woman in the film) · Papad: who has broken off with his girlfriend for reasons unknown till the end. Also his metaphorical jibe talks on neend nahi aati bounces over your head.·Mushy: for whom killing is nothing personal, strictly a business.·Chicken: who despite being a big phattu with a conscience, accompanies his friends in crime. · Mamta Sekri: an underworld lady don (minus the ruthlessness that the character demands) who maintains a complete bio-data record of unknown debtors on her laptop. · Dilnawaz: a Preity Zinta talk-alike who quarrels with rickshaw drivers over 50 paise but doesn't hesitate offering money to her boyfriend for fake Gujrat relief funds.On a serious note: The boys lose a big cricket bet and instantly take up the crime path without second thoughts. The transformation of the characters from losers to sinners is least convincing. Overcome by hysteria, Chicken soon shoots himself. Aryan wants to step back. With half-baked subplots, characters start dying abruptly and unimaginatively. And before you realize it's the end (thankfully).The movie is over-edited in the initial reels and the pace is too fast to feel, absorb, react or relate. Camera-work is bad. Dialogues and performances are passable. But the story lacks novelty and the direction lacks the hard-hitting punch. Also the depiction of underworld lacks the realistic touch."
