" Don't Judge a Book by its COVER","I had this movie with me for more than a week and I had no intention of seeing it. A few comments and a Night (that I'll always remember) later I was sure that I had seen one of the MOST ENTERTAINING movie in Bollywood ever (and yes I've seen A LOT). The whole ambiance of the movie is such that it is best seen at night, with a friend (but I enjoyed it most watching it alone) and SMOKES (don't forget the smokes).... I was not a fan of NEHA DHUPIA's acting and the only movie I had seen of ABHAY DEOL was "Socha Na tha", so I thought "well how good can it be?" Well 3 hrs later my question was answered, and it was "AWESOME". From the Unpredictable story to the Fascinating and Quirky (dont forget eccentric) characters, it was a joy-ride like no other. The background score is also a delight for sore ears (sore with all those Copycats and Himesh's nose bleeding high pitches). From the smooth bluesy guitar licks to the simple songs it was all a welcome intervention in the movie. CHARACTERS-- My favorite character in this movie was MALVANKAR (or Harami Malvankar as he says it). Ashok Samarth is just too good as the Corrupt police officer with an attitude and presence the size of MT.Everest. Many of the characters reminded me of a classic series with a record for being Quirky and diff "Seinfeld".... and the comparison is worth every word of it.Neha Dupia did well too (considering her track record) and this was the turning point in her career, after this she actually did start acting. Abhay Deol is the diff type of hero who actually dares to be diff, and hats off to him, as he can act (unlike most of the other Deols). In the end all I want is for you my friends to watch this GEM of a movie..." 
" In the Guy Ritchie mold","Finally we have a director who is truly inspired by Guy Ritchie movies. And I mean it when I say inspired, unlike those retard directors who rip off scene by scene in the name of "inspiration". Sanjay Khanduri has added his own style of narration to the slick, no non-sense editing style of some of the best directors and the characterization of Guy Ritchie and has come up with something worth watching.Abhay Deol is one of those millions of people who travel in Mumbai local trains. How he ends up owning 25 million rupees in two and a half hours is the story in a nutshell. En route, he encounters Pulp Fictionesque characters and ends up in situations like one. Neha Dhupia did a fairly significant role and her acting wasn't too bad either.What is so special about the movie is that, Guy Ritchie himself wouldn't improvise it too much if he had to make it... may be remove a few crude jokes and add a few of his own. Several gangs fighting over a piece of merchandise has been the strong forte of his films. Khanduri did a good job given the resources. A worthwhile watch!!" 
" Excellent Movie a must watch","I was skeptical to watch this low budget no glam face movie, but i was proved wrong by miles this movie is zillion times better than any of the Karan Johar or any big hit masala movies.The story is humorous thrilling full of anticipation and best of all UNPREDICTABLE, believe me guys the the story is totally unpredictable probably this was the first bollywood movie whose story i was unable to predict.Abhay Deol, Neha Dhupia & Ashok Samarth (Playing Malvankar Inspector) have done a good job.Over all its a must see but not fit for family audience (do not take kids with u)." 
" What Happens When You Miss The Last Train?","I very much enjoyed this dark comedy that is most set in a night between 1:40 and 4:10. On his way home a young man, Nilesh misses the last train. The next one's due at 4:10 so he goes wondering the streets in search of a taxi or any other alternative that will get him home. He only has 70 rupees but, by the end of the night, he ends up with 25 million. How? During Nilesh's adventure (or misadventure) we are introduced to various characters including a Nana Patekar wannabe wannabe, a corpulent 'cabaret' singer, an obese 'hijra', a glass-eyed hit-man, a wacky chatterbox of a tomboy, a ruthless CC (corrupt cop) and lots of unusual 'visitors' of the night.Abhay Deol is one of the very few fine actors of the current generation who is a risk-taker. I'd seen him earlier in 'Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd' where he was hilarious and here the actor just merges very well into the character that is equally comedic. He's not afraid at all to look like a fool on screen (as required by the character), something that will scare most of his peers away. The actor bravely accepts the part and does a remarkable job. Neha Dhupia is mostly adequate but in a few scenes, she tends to go over the top. The supporting cast are great and really bring out the humour. I just thought the three hit men in the car sequences were bit loud and could have used some slight toning down.The songs play in the background. There is one very pleasant song that often repeats in the background, a great song for a rainy or just-rained scene. The cabaret number 'Kukuruku' is quite catchy. The voice-over is quite charming and quirky and gives more insight into Nilesh's character.Director Khanduri deserves a pat on the shoulder for coming up with something different that is so much fun to watch. He's clearly inspired by Tarantino and Richie and creatively puts his inspiration to good use in the film. For me, '1:40 Ki Last Local' is one of the ideal rainy day flicks." 
" great movie","it's really great film. such a long time after i have seen original work. from beginning to end, you can not imagine that what will be happen in next seen. film is completely roller coaster. Particular dialog is really give perfect mood to the film. i don't say the story because it is better if you watch from start to finish. everybody have done a great job. Direction, editing, casting, Music, background music. even their was not much scope for songs some how Music director have done a great job. Particularly last 10 minis is really exiting. i like to say to KARAN JOHAR that make this kind film rather than making same kind of film, with the same casting. i must salute to entire team of the EK CHALIS KI LAST LOCAL. hey guys carry on to make brilliant movie...!" 
" Great Movie","The movie is a must see for all ages except children (<10), who might not understand. I liked the role of Malvankar/Mala/Nilesh. Especially, Malvankar has a unique way of delivering dialog, which is very appealing. Most of the time humor is subtle but admirable. Movie's storyline never lets you down or get you bored, it elicits that creative thinking can produce great story. Background music and songs are awesome. Overall, KUDOS to awesome directing. I watched this movie 2-3 times and did not find any place where I could say this could not happen to me. I would say "Quartet Productions Pvt. Ltd." keep it up, there is striking contrast between last movie from the production "Let's Enjoy" and this. I am eagerly waiting for another movie like this." 
" A lifetime packed into 3 hours!","Abhay Deol plays Nilesh, a Call Center worker who misses the last local leaving at 1:40 am. The next one is only at 4:20 and the remaining hours cannot be spent on the platform. His 'chance' encounter with Madhu (Neha Dhupia), who is also looking for a taxi/auto leads to a rollicking adventure that goes from thrills to chills to the downright macabre. In these three hours we encounter eunuchs, hookers, psychopaths, various gang lords, corrupt Mumbai policemen (including a scripture quoting one modeled after the Samuel L. Jackson character from Pulp Fiction), a cabbie who thinks he is Nana Patekar, an encounter between Nilesh and a gang lord that involves ropes, gags and blindfolds (like Pulp Fiction again), kidnappings, ransom deliveries, a neophyte cop who would like to be Rajnikant. In short there is something for everyone and this one is a rollicking ride and lots of fun as we follow a good looking couple on the run for their life. There are many moments of homage to movies both HW and BW and there is lots of humor packed in.I really like Abhay Deol - yet again he demonstrates his acting abilities as the ladies man wannabe and a poor sucker who gets caught in events out of his control. He is charming and can he act! Neha Dhupia was decent as the streetwalker and the rest of the cast did their job very well. This movie has a song in a bar and music in the background, but no real singing and dancing, and is another one of the new style BW films that are cropping up this year. A good one and worth a watch!" 
" Pulp Neo-Noir","Has to be one of the (at that time) weird crime comedies ever made, esp. in India. Pity the director hasn't been as prolific since, but that's another matter. Once again, belonging to my favorite genre of all time, noir, in a setting I absolutely adore, that of events occurring in real-time (almost, it's actually over the course of 1 night and.....).The performances are good, though not from all performers - occasionally the lack- of-budget shows. The production design, cinematography and soundtrack perfectly complement the material, which keeps surprises coming, yet does not sacrifice each set-piece just for the sake of moving to the next, a common failing in most makers' initial works.Be warned, all of the comedy is dark, very dark, and the setting is the pits, with none of the characters even resembling role models. Not for everyone, and not for the faint of heart. Neha Dhupia's a wonder, what with her movie choices including this and 'Mithya' (another fab Indie). Abhay Deol always had taste to pick his subjects, but I didn't know this at the time this one came out. But he has to be the most courageous lead in an Indian movie ever, with what he lets the material do to/with his character, esp. nearing the 'climax' of the flick. I have to be honest though - the title led me to assume that the movie might have been completely set in the local itself, and when I knew it would not be, I would have been disappointed if the movie had not turned out to be as fun as this did. Definitely worth a watch, maybe a few." 
" Situational Comedy...","Ek Chalis Ki Last Local starring Abhay Deol and Neha Dhupia who miss their last train to Vikhroli and have two and a half hours to kill before their next train. They end up in a bar. One thing leads to another and in these few hours of their life they go through a number of experiences and events - some good, some bad. But by the end of it each character's life is altered completely.The movie has some hilarious moments worth watching. The comedy is well tuned to present day taste, and is not melodramatic or over-acted. Overall, a movie worth watching once.Abhay has a nice comedy timing, and does not seem all that stupid. Neha's acting is credible." 
" Talks Mumbai. ♦ 74%","Evidently a cult in the making, the makers have set the bar high with a very apt cast & engaging story-line.Talking about how Mumbai behaves with its inhabitants, it links with three different stories that culminate into something grave, but eventually breakthrough. Focusing on native topics about the nightlife, the plot constantly introduces new characters. And the characters are totally deep in their portrayal. Rolling finely & softly for 150 minutes, Ek Chalis Ki Last Local never bores off and indeed entertains with references in crime, drama, love & songs.Fantastic screenplay & lucid dreaming-sequences makes it a perfect Bollywood crime comedy. Neha Dhupia is hot & perfect, while Abhay Deol steals the show with his glamor & introspection.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOMouth-Kiss: Mild | Foreplay/Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Smoking/Alcohol: Strong | Violence/Gore: Critical | Porn: No | Profanity: Very Strong" 
" Awesome entertainer","I must have seen this film 22 times. Something about it that makes you laugh all the time. Hv a full circle of friends mad over Ek Chalis. I very much enjoyed this dark comedy that is most set in a night between 1:40 and 4:10. On his way home a young man, Nilesh misses the last train. The next one's due at 4:10 so he goes wondering the streets in search of a taxi or any other alternative that will get him home. He only has 70 rupees but, by the end of the night, he ends up with 25 million. How? During Nilesh's adventure (or misadventure) we are introduced to various characters including a Nana Patekar wannabe wannabe, a corpulent 'cabaret' singer, an obese 'hijra', a glass-eyed hit-man, a wacky chatterbox of a tomboy, a ruthless CC (corrupt cop) and lots of unusual 'visitors' of the night.Abhay Deol is one of the very few fine actors of the current generation who is a risk-taker. Though he seems to be getting into greedy now. . Neha Dhupia is mostly adequate but in a few scenes, she tends to go over the top. Still her best job till date. The supporting cast are great and really bring out the humor. I just thought the cops and gay goon who tries to rape Abhay was cooool. Three hit men in the car sequences were bit loud and could have used some slight toning down. But twist in screenplay keeps u on edge. I think he has screenplay sense and art of film making better than Sajid Khans and 99% of directors boasting today. The songs play in the background are blended so well. There is one very pleasant song that often repeats in the background, a great song for a rainy or just-rained scene. The cabaret number 'Kukuruku' is quite catchy. The voice-over is quite charming and quirky and gives more insight into Nilesh's character.Director Khanduri deserves a pat on the shoulder for coming up with something different that is so much fun to watch. Now Im just dying to see this director's new film KLPD aka Kismat Love Paisa Dilli. He is coming back after 5 years we r hoping it is as mad or more." 
" 1:40 Ki Last Local","What could be this movie about? The title is so mis-leading. It sounds surely like an art movie. Knowing the star cast of Abhey Doel and Neha Dhupia  I expected to be a slow love story. Let us know the story. It is interesting! The movie is about Nilesh (Abhey Doel) who misses the last local train from Kurla station in Bombay at 1:40 am in the morning; he meets another person  a girl (Neha Dhupia) who has also missed the last local train of 1:40 am. Both under the same crisis, give each other's company, and start walking in the dead night of Bombay. It leads them to a bar club, where they think of spending some time till 4:10 am, so that they can catch the first local train at 4:10 am. In the bar Nilesh meets his friend, who takes him to play a game of cards. From this point on the movie takes usual turn and sky rockets into something that was not expected.I will not tell you anything what happens after that  but it is interesting and for people loving dark cinema like the one made by Quentin Tarantino, would appreciate the attempt by the first time director Sanjay Kanduri takes us on a roller coaster ride of unexpected twists and turns to his story, which he himself has written. Surely Sanjay has tried his best to remain one step ahead of his audience and given classic surprises  some would be difficult for Indian audiences to digest and accept, but kudos to his conviction.Till the last frame of the movie, Sanjay Kanduri keeps the audience glued to the merry go round of characters and he could have taken the movie to any ending, but gives us a pleasing and happy one.This is my second movie I have seen of Abhey Doel, and I think he is not a bad actor at all; and this movie he shows a very good sense of humor and timing for delivery apt dialogues funnily. Neha Dhupia looks great and has acted well to suit the type-cast character she has often played in past.There are many Marathi stage artists Sanjay Kanduri has used; who have performed well.This is my last word for people with weak stomach; if you do not like dark cinema of blood and gory, this is not the cup of tea for you. There are also some stupid moments in some episodes in the movie, but for the first time director I would be little more lenient to like the attempt and give(Stars 6.5 out of 10)" 
" Good one ....","I was skeptical about watching this one. But finally managed to convince myself and watched this one. And I didn't regret it.It is similar to a typical 7 pointer movie from Hollywood. Not much style not much hype - just a plain simple story. Its basically a story of a young call centre employee Nilesh who misses his last 1.40 am train. Then he meets a girl named Madhu and as the night unfolds itself into some unexpected events. And for the next two and a half hours we are subjected to games played by Nilesh's fate with him putting him into all sorts of trouble and at the same time getting him out of it unscathed. At the break of the day he is as the sole owner of 2.5 crores.The only problem was the acting. Abhay Deol seriously needs some acting lessons and same goes for Neha Dhupia.But overall an enjoyable and a one time movie !" 
" It's a Cult Film Gone Unnoticed","I saw it very late on a DVD with my husband. We thought it was an interesting name for a film. But watching it we were awed. Very less have I seen so poised film from begin to end gaining dramatic momentum as it progresses. Abhay Deol and Neha Dhupia are stupendous. I was amazed by glamor gal Neha's unlikely pick actually. I think Indian film makers have give a let go to this film as just a good film due to its New Director and Producer. Sadly Ek Chalis Ki Last Local is a Cult film of Indian cinema gone unnoticed due to low profile people behind it. For me it is the first attempt near Real-time filming in India. Dhai ghante mein dhai crore(2 1/2 crore in 2 1/2 hours) is an apt tag line and yes the film is also of 2 1/2 hrs. I'll say its a must watch for all cine lovers not just in India but across the world. cheers to the makers. I look forward to see more work of this director. It rocks." 
" A Bollywood dark comedy","What's up Bollywood, you are actually making movies that are out of line!! Ek Challis Ki Last Local is a dark comedy, and the surprising thing about this one is that it is more realistic and enjoyable than most other movies from the tinsel town. Even the songs are blended in...talk about that! Abhay Deol seems to be picking roles that require more acting than doing the dance numbers which is a step in the right direction. Guess a fresh new director can bring new ideas in, and Bollywood does need more Khanduris and Kukunoors. Could have been more tightly done as the second half seemed to drag, but still enjoyable and watchable than most of the Bollywood movies out there. Not one for family viewing though. 7/10." 
" A pleasantly different and more enjoyable ride from Bollywood!","Surprisingly off-beat-yet-mainstream adventure/comedy/thriller from Bollywood, starting with a guy missing his local train ride home ('Last local train at 1.40 a.m' is how the title would translate, roughly). While it owes a huge debt to Tarantino in terms of some of the plotting and some of the tone, and a few direct nods to scenes from his films (as well as others, like Lock, Stock, etc), it is not a rip-off by any means (unlike Kaante, or others). The whole film takes place on one night, from 1.40 a.m to a few hours later, when the next train is leaving. The script remains interesting enough, even though it begins to drag a bit in a few parts (the 143 minutes could've used some trimming), and always has a twist up its sleeve. Characterization is good, especially of our hero, who is perhaps the most realistic and believable hero I've seen in Indian cinema for a long, long time. Abhay Deol plays the role not as a typical, hunky, macho superhero, but as a slightly cowardly, greedy, horny, and put-upon guy. Neha Dhupia is sublime in the first half as the 'average middle-class girl' who tags along with our hero, having missed the same train. In the latter part, she is a bit loud and unbelievable, but it may be the scriptwriter's fault here. The other characters, mostly of the dubious variety, are also fine (I especially loved the in-jokes, like the rickshaw driver aping Nana Patekar's dialogue delivery & poking fun at some of NP's most iconic lines.....obviously this kind of reference can only be enjoyed by people tuned into Bollywood cinema). Thankfully the music is used sparingly and instead of musical numbers to disrupt the proceedings, it is incorporated in the story smoothly. I was led to believe that the film contained quite a bit of raunch, but other than a passionate kiss, there's nothing. Which is amazing, considering most 'family oriented' Bollywood fare these days has more risqué stuff than this film. All the more surprising, since Neha is known for her 'revealing' roles in steamy thrillers, but she keeps her clothes on the whole time here (still, she looks ravishing even in her demure appearance). This would have been a drawback for me in a typical Indian film, but this one actually doesn't need to rely on such 'lowest common denominators'. Despite a few rough edges and a slightly bloated running time, this is a superior Bollywood thriller that I wouldn't mind watching again soon."
