" Stunning","I was lucky enough to see this in the theater in the United States when it first came out. I had seen a few Shahrukh Khan films on tape (thanks to a friend), and when I noticed "Devdas" in the online movie listings, I decided to go have a look at what would be my first Hindi film in a theater. I was the only Anglo in a packed house and I aroused as much curiosity as I felt.I was completely blown away by Devdas, from the first moment of the opening credits to the last bitter tear on Paro's cheek. Every shot, every frame of this film is like an artist's canvas. Aishwarya Rai is breathtakingly gorgeous, Madhuri Dixit's quiet beauty increases with each scene, and Shahrukh has never looked so good. All the supporting actors are incredible, particularly Jackie Shroff as Chuni-babu and Kiron Kher as Paro's mother.The sets and the costumes are fabulously opulent...almost too fabulous, in fact, and at times threaten to overwhelm the story. But I was far too enthralled in the theater to do anything but gasp in open-mouthed wonder, and enjoy.The story of Devdas, a famous Indian novel written in the 1920's by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay, has been made into film numerous times by Bollywood. It is about the spoiled son of a wealthy man, who is loved by Paro, his lower caste neighbor and childhood playmate. Devdas is a weak, aimless sort who is blown about by destiny, never taking action until it is too late. He is unable to recognize his love for Paro until she has been married off to an older man and is lost to him forever. He then turns to the bottle, and to the prostitute Chandramukhi, for comfort and forgetfulness.This story will probably be hard for westerners to relate to...there is no corresponding literature of the west that I can think of...perhaps Romeo & Juliet is closest. Bhansali's version differs in many respects from previous versions, and from the book, in that Devdas is a more forceful presence who declares his love for Paro, only to be kept apart by scheming family members. In the novel, however, it is Devdas' own flawed character that keep the lovers apart. He is simply too weak and indecisive to know what he wants until it is taken away forever.Having seen the earlier Dilip Kumar/Bimal Roy version, and read the novel, I can say that Shahrukh Khan truly made the character his own and breathed a new life into Devdas, making him more lovable, and more a victim of fate than of his own tragic weakness. In the novel, and in the earlier Bimal Roy film, Devdas has almost no personality at all...he moves through the story like a mere shadow, and we only see his character reflected in the love of the two women who worship him.Much attention has been given to Aishwarya Rai for her performance, which I agree was outstanding. She is almost inhumanly beautiful in this film. When I saw this in the theater I was in half love with her myself.But it was Chandramukhi who haunted me after the film was over. Madhuri Dixit deserves much, much more attention than she has received for her wonderful performance, which has been relegated to a "supporting" role, when actually her role is every bit equal in importance to that of Paro. Chandramukhi is the only character in the film who is completely unselfish in her love...her love is the purest of the three, because she loves with no expectation of being loved in return. While Devdas and Paro are busy destroying each other's chances for happiness, Chandramukhi's love is always uplifting and positive.Besides the award-winning performances (Devdas swept all the Bollywood popular awards in 2003) and the fabulous sets and costumes, Dedas has one of the best music scores I've ever heard, and dance numbers to match. I wished the opening number, Mere Piyar (performed by Rai), could have gone on forever, and toward the end Dola Re Dola (performed by Dixit and Rai) is a treat. Some viewers felt that the up-beat drinking song Chalak Chalak (performed by Khan, Shroff and Dixit) was out of place in such a dramatic story, but it is my favorite number in the movie.There are so many things to recommend this film, I could go on, but I will just call it a masterpiece of Indian cinema and leave it at that." 
" lavish and dazzling, another classic","I have not seen the other previous versions of Devdas, but as far as this Devdas goes, I can say that it is really difficult to transform such an old and popular story into such an amazing film without being boring, and the director has successfully managed this task.
The set decorators, choreographers and the costume designers must be lauded very very highly. It is truly amazing and a real pleasure to just even observe these three elements. Of course, Aishwarya Rai (Parvati) is so incredibly beautiful, the camera loves her, and she sparkles like a diamond. Still, (also credited above Aishwarya) Madhuri Dixit (Chandramukhi) is the real acting talent.
I had great pleasure watching this lyric melodrama, although it lasted about three hours, it deserves all kinds of appraisal." 
" A Bittersweet Classic","Gloriously excessive Bollywood epic starring former Miss World Aishwarya Rai. Set in the 30s and sumptuously shot, it follows a lovelorn suitor's slide into alcoholism and despair Bhansali's film boasts the biggest budget for an Indian film ever and boy, does it show. An extravagant tale of love, loss and serious drinking, it operates on a scale previously unseen in Bollywood. Essentially a tragic love triangle, the story follows tortured Devdas (Khan) as he mucks things up with childhood sweetheart Paro (Rai), meets courtesan Chandramukhi (Dixit) and then drinks himself to death. A spirited anti-hero, in India his name his synonymous with a sort of heroic failure.
Everything about the film - costumes, sets, songs and sentiments - is larger than life and the sheer spectacle demands respect. The musical numbers cast Devdas and Paro as the mythical lovers Krishna and Radha. Cheeky, sexy and dizzyingly complex, the dancers display astonishing energy and precision, whole sequences shot from above to resemble the shifting patterns of a kaleidoscope. Certainly there are moments of daftness. A half-cut Devdas resolves a financial dispute by setting fire to a sofa, for example, and nobody tries to stop him. But there's also humour, style and a conclusion that's plenty teary. As Western directors continue to look to Bollywood for inspiration this is a shining example how it should be done. Intoxicating.
Verdict Starts big, gets a whole lot bigger then gets twice as big after that, this is Bollywood at its most flamboyant. The song and dance numbers alone are worth the price of entry and whether you're familiar with the genre or not this is irresistible from start to finish." 
" Greatest love story of all","I have to admit that as great as Devdas is, I can't watch it too often as it is far too depressing but it is ultimately the most spectacular movie I have seen in a long time. Aside from its theme, the film making process was awesome including the costumes, the cinematography, the direction, camera angles. Imagine the number of hours the extras worked their *beep* off to dance in sync. Even the soundtrack was perfectly tuned to help set the mood of the movie and hearing Paro (Aiswarya Rai's character) sing for her love lost for Devdas (Shahrukh Khan) on her wedding day was enough to make you burst into tears.The actors chosen were perfect for their roles as they portrayed it with such heart wrenching gut, you could almost feel their sorrow along with them. I was particularly surprised how Aishwarya Rai pulled off her biggest acting role to-date, thereby quashing any doubts on her previous beauty queen title. Shahrukh Khan once again proves why he is the reigning king of Bollywood playing a heartbroken alcoholic pining for the love of his life who's been married off to another man. Madhuri Dixit was equally wonderful as the beautiful courtesan who played her role with such empathy that I couldn't help but feel sorry for her and wished Devdas would eventually reciprocate her feelings for him. Jackie Shroff has never disappointed and was excellent in his supporting role as Devdas 'brothel' companion. All in all, the cast ensemble of this movie is one of the best in cinema history.This movie is also a perfect (and spectacular) introduction to first timers of Bollywood movies into the lives and culture of Indian/Asian people in general. How, in this modern and civilised world, old traditions and values still hold dear in certain communities and whilst it is not the most favourable of beliefs, it is the age old cultural practices that makes one culture unique to the other.Yes, no movie is perfect but Devdas almost does it so watch it with an open mind. Being Asian myself, I dare be bold and say this is better than 'Gone With The Wind'." 
" Devine!","I had never seen a Bollywood film before (being a white girl who only knows a few swear words in Punjabi) so Devdas was a new experience for me. I thought it was simply wonderful, rich, vibrant and full of colour. I couldn't recommend it enough for someone who wants to see what all the fuss is about Bollywood. The story is Romantic and timeless, a spin on Romeo and Juliette if you will. The story unfolds through song and dance sequences that feature beautiful women who do not need to expose themselves to be erotic. The humour in the film for me came when Devdas started speaking like an English gent in the middle of an argument with his father...very amusing view on the Western world! Anyway, as I said, I would encourage anyone with an open mind to have a look at this film." 
" Most Tragic Film Ever Made In Bollywood","Background: This film is based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyaya's novel 'Devdas'. Sanjay Leela Bhansali has perfectly altered some parts of novel to suit the film.The movie continuously keeps on drooping till it ends.Its a perfect anticlimax kind of movie. Brief Story: Initial part of first half of the film shows immense bonding between childhood playmates Devdas(Shahrukh Khan) and Paro(Aishwarya Rai) and the reactions of all other characters to there relationship.Later part of the first half shows how circumstances result in the separation of these 2 lovers. Second Half shows the impact of separation which drives Devdas to stunning courtesan Chandramukhi(Madhuri Dixit).Devdas drains himself into excessive drinking in an attempt to get Paro out of his mind and also to prevent Chandramukhi from entering into his mind.Ultimately Devdas drinks himself to death, loosing both women.(One whom he could never stop loving and One whom he could never love).Salient Features of the movie : 1)Combining three biggest stars and extracting there acting to maximum possible extent by unbelievably talented filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali. 2)The film perfectly depicts its timeline(Pre Independence Era)through its strikingly attractive and huge sets,through richness of costumes etc. 3)Another striking feature is the dialogues.One hardly finds these kind of precise and sentimental dialogues in present day Bollywood films.If you really want to know what a tragedy is ,then Devdas is best the example!! Just go for it !!" 
" Sanjay leela bhansali : A magician","SLB is a god gifted director to bollywood and i am again spellbound by his work. He is the only director who can remake a super hit 1960s movie in 2002 with the same essence. This movie was marvelously made with a powerful star cast with mesmerizing scenes, dialogues and music at the same time.Aishwarya rai has done her best and Madhuri was the same refreshing as 8 years ago. Shahrukh khan to put his best and this makes this movies unforgettable.I consider this movie as one of the best movies made in India. I recommend this movie to everyone because even after the end, this movie won't get out of your mind." 
" DEVDAS recalls the Hollywood musicals of a long-ago era","DEVDAS (2002) is a beautifully mounted romantic melodrama based on a popular Indian novel published in 1917. When I first read about the film and its enthusiastic reception at Cannes, I had high hopes that this might become the first Bollywood film to cross over to arthouse audiences in the U.S. While watching it, however, it became clear that the class-conflict narrative would be a tough sell these days with its supremely overwrought tale of parental disapproval, family honor, unrequited love, and two beautiful women's complete and utter devotion to an irredeemably dissipated man who is left with nothing. It's also more deeply rooted in Hindi culture than the other Bollywood movies I've seen and would most benefit a viewer who had more than a passing knowledge of it. In comparing DEVDAS to MOHABBATEIN (2000) and TAAL (1999), the other Bollywood musicals I've seen, I would cite a few Hollywood parallels. DEVDAS is like a Jeanette MacDonald-Nelson Eddy MGM musical of the 1930s (e.g. MAYTIME, 1937, with which it shares some surprising similarities) to MOHABBATEIN's SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS or TAAL's BYE BYE BIRDIE. (When I saw MOHABBATEIN I also thought of WEST SIDE STORY and GREASE.)
I enjoyed MOHABBATEIN and TAAL much more, but I was still gripped by DEVDAS and its high romantic expression of love through song, dance, and incredibly rich, poetic dialogue. It's a powerfully old-fashioned film, which is not necessarily a bad thing." 
" Don't settle for English version!!!!!","What can I say, Devdas is a spectacular classic on par with Gone With the Wind and Cecil B. DeMille. At first I was pleased that there was an English version, and I would not have to read subtitles BUT - IT'S CUT!!! The final song is missing, and parts of most of the other songs are snipped. Whole scenes are missing!!!! Luckily I watched the Hindi version first. It is far superior in that it is complete, plus it looks better. I did need the English version to iron out some of the plot - although a couple of the scenes that I needed translated had been cut. In future, if they are not going to English version the whole movie, subtitles are better. Dola Re is the best song/dance number ever!!!!!!!!!!" 
" Lush, lavish, lovely - but ....","I owned this film for 8 months but did not see it because of all the negative hype on the board. Then I took the plunge. First off let me say that I was not a great Saratchandra admirer. His stories (except SWAMI) mostly portrayed women as weak minded, subservient (maybe true to the time, but not to be admired), and men as weak and mostly well bred but not well educated. I had no real recollection of the story as written. And, not being a great Dilip Kumar fan, I never watched the old version. So, I have no comparisons to draw, no plot line differences to talk about.I came away moved by the tragic love story that unfolded. It was not flawless, most Bollywood movies are not.Negatives - the sets were beautiful but over the top, ditto for the costumes. The duo dance was a great way to compare Aish vs Madhuri dancing skills (both were pretty even matched for me) but in the story line it was quite silly and should not have been there. There was no real need for the the two to meet, but this was Mr, Bhansali's directorial license. Chandramukhi's kotha and environs were lifted straight from Pakeezah, which was a very stylized movie and not authentic.Positives: Shahrukh Khan gave a very restrained performance, the silent tears accompanied with an anguish that only his eyes portrayed was a real departure from the screwed-up face crying. He was very very good in the drunk bits, very good in the anguished bits. It is remarkable how much this actor is accused of being typecast when every other year he pulls out an amazing performance - Dil Se (1998), Asoka (2001) and Devdas (2002) are all departures from his usual typecast romantic hero image. Recent roles in Swades and KANK are even more varied. The detractors will keep saying he overacted, or he portrayed no emotions, for me this was a truly great role as an anguished lover. Mr. Khan - your best actor award for this role in Devdas was well deserved.Madhuri - what can one say about this truly great icon? She was amazing, you felt her pain, her caring, her selfless love, the moments between her and Shahrukh sizzled. And her dancing was brilliant.Aish - was a bit wooden at times, but not always. She had a chemistry with Shahrukh that was understated until she was beyond his reach, but come on - the woman looks amazing, is there any doubt that a hundred Devdas types are dying for her?? She was better as the movie progressed to the more serious part.The movie went into an emotional downward spiral a third of the way in and I sat there moved and almost crying for these tortured souls the rest of the two hours.The movie was eye candy in the sets and costumes department. The two leading ladies were stunning, Shahrukh was easy on the eye, yet there was something that did detract from this being a great film. Upon much thinking I have come to the conclusion that it was the over the top beauty of everything that really made everything a little unreal for me. How could such perfect people have such imperfect lives? In essence the little black mark on the lip was missing and that left me a little dissatisfied.If Mr. Bhansali had stated that this was an adaptation from the original novel, people would forgive him the fact that Devdas in his version is a mature man and knows his mind (although fails to act decisively on it), and the fact that an aristocratic lady visits a courtesan's establishment and the two dance together.If you do not compare with what did or did not come before, this was an intense emotional experience, anchored by great performances from Shahrukh, Madhuri and yes, even Aish." 
" A gigantic wonderful steamroller of a movie","Having just seen Devdas, I wondered how it had been received by other viewers.I am a 'Westerner' who has had a growing interest in 'Bollywood' movies and music over the last few years (and found it a very difficult genre to explore - since it's poorly represented in shops, except those in "Asian" areas of major cities in the UK).I've seen enough to realise that Devdas was going to be a huge visual feast - almost too much to take. Heck... I was blown away by the trailer! I found it gripping and intense and extremely 'stylish'. Thundercracks, wailing children, whip cracks, stunningly lit glimpses of the more attractive cast members and wild swirling colours! What else could you want?My colleagues and I were aware of the overly melodramatic content. I can see characters from Victorian plays and themes that are covered in a lot of films from around the world - mainly the 'Romeo and Juliet' idea of love being thwarted by families, traditions, prejudices and missed opportunities.But Devdas is like a wonderful steamroller. It drives straight over you and leaves you breathless. I don't think I have ever seen anything quite so visually wild and exciting.Early Hollywood epics had 'spectacle', but all on a grand scale - vast buildings, arenas, crowds. Devdas packs all this into a much smaller space, turns up the colour to maximum and then lights the whole thing up like a firework display. The dance sequences are stunning, Paro's flight through the house as she runs to the dying Devdas is stunning - the whole film is stunning.Hang the historical accuracy... this movie is an unforgettable experience." 
" Forget the haters! This is an awesome film!","Coming off a film like 'Albela', it was very important for Aishwarya Rai to do a film like this! A lot of people had been speculating about her beauty, charm, acting and dancing skills etc. etc. and I think this was the film that shut them all up. I can't imagine that so many people think this film is crap, yet there are 92 reviews and comments before mine. I think that's saying something. Anyhow, in this Epic of Titanic proportions, Aishwarya Rai plays Paro, a lovely young woman coming of age, whose sole purpose in life is to worship her childhood friendship and friend Devdas (played by Shah Rukh Khan), just one look at her and you can tell that Paro/Pavrati is one half of a two part series of star-crossed lovers. It's Romeo and Juliet meets Titanic meet Tuck everlasting meets every colourful bollywood picture you have ever seen all rolled into one magnificent masterpiece! While they are preteens, Devdas is sent away by his family to go study in England and this devastates Paro who is chastised by her mother for over-reacting during the boy's departure. As she blossoms into a teenager, Paro's love for Devdas only grows and one day she is told that Devdas is to return home to India. Naturally, she is beyond overjoyed and prepares herself for his arrival, only to develop an inexplicable fright when he finally comes to her house to see her. A game of cat and mouse ensues but the two would-be lovers finally come face to face and find that their attraction has grown. Enter the evil conniving family feuds, the caste systems and surely you know that all this takes a toll on this everlasting friendship. Somehow, Paro's love eludes Devdas and he winds up with a gypsy's curse looming over his head until the final moment of the film when Paro's husband executes his own curse on his wife, while Devdas's curse finally catches up with him. A devastating and earth shattering blow that ends their friendship and love forever! This of course, is only part of the story, there are lots of twists and turns and while it is a remake of the 1950s classic of the same name, this version is a unique must see of its own. Don't miss the show-stopping song and dance numbers especially 'Sisila ye' and 'Dola re Dola' which teams up the dancing queens (Ash and Madhuri Dixit) in a dance-floor showdown! A+" 
" an overproduced elitist film","Devdas, to my understanding, was written as an insight into a tortured soul. It was also a parable of class and almost feudal divisions- something which the Indian subcontinent is still struggling to get over.This is where the production values of Devdas destroyed the essence the story- for some reason, perhaps because he had a budget that was unprecedented in Indian cinema, director Bhansali decided to go opulent in every facet of the the production. Paro's family, who in the text is a working class family, lives is a mansion on their own right in the film. I found it hard to empathize/ sympathize with any of the character's logic about "lower class" versus "upper class" because the production made them all more wealthy than 99.9% of the population of India! It puts an elitist spin on the entire film, and I really didn't appreciate it.Devdas is not a story that deserves opulence- it is a dark, personal tale. It's spaces are small and internalized, almost claustrophobic. The character of Devdas is continually drawn inward, and he brings everyone he loves down with him into his abyss. What we are given instead is a wide open canvas, something more fitting for an epic battle between nations, not hearts.Some might argue that Devdas is an exercise in escapism, but what the novel was about was escapism in an entirely different spectrum. Alcoholism is indeed escapism, but in the worst possible way. So is class discrimination. If Bhansali really wanted to create an opulent epic worthy of his budget and production team, he should have chosen a subject such as the Taj Mahal or the life of the Nizam. What he's given us is a high gloss finish on a rough and tormented subject- a very ill fit indeed.And on a side note, I found it funny that the entirety of Chandramukhi's village was lit by 10,000,000 candles. Women with saris take extreme caution." 
" The most lavish Indian movie ever","The most lavish Indian movie ever.Sanjay Leela Bhansali creates a visual master piece.Every thing looks stunning.Visuals are simply stunning and breath taking.Personally,i have never seen such a beautiful and a colorful movie like this one.There are colors every where and the sets compliment the color a lot.They are simply stunning.Camera work compliments the film a lot capturing the best shoots.Costumes are simply amazing.Every part is decorated very well.Technically,the movie is amazingActing was excellent.Shah Rukh breathes life into his country and has given a very moving performance as the heart broken and alcholic Devdas.He impresses in the drunk scenes.Aishwarya looks completely stunning and has done an excellent job.Her dance Silsila is a treat to watch.Madhuri too is excellent too in a short role.Her dances Kaahe Cheed Mohe and Maar Daala are a treat to watch.She and Aishs Dola Re is a treat to watch.Kirron Kher is first rate and so is Smita Jaykar.The most weirdest thing i say is,Kirrons dance in Morey Piya is a treat to watch.Jackie Sheroff hams and is passable.Music by Ismail Darbar compliments the film a lot.Direction by Bhansali is never the less excellent.After making the excellent Hum Dil De.He has made another wonderful flick.Go watch it.you will not be disappointed" 
" Devdas 2002","The film Devdas raises a few questions ? How much liberty a film maker can be allowed ? Is it fair to change locale ? A few incidents in the film are not mentioned in the book should such incidents be allowed to be included in the film.The  attributes of the charactars of story are different from one the origianal author  - is it fair to to him ? Devdas of Sharadbabu id different from that of Sanjay's.Can a film maker make such substatial changes in the plot of film. Say a character is shown to be dead at the end of the story , can a filmaker show him living at the end or if A marries B in ther story can a film maker show him marrying C ?There should be some limit. To me it seems Sanjay has crossed those limits.(Maybe its my opinion )." 
" Classic Bollywood Cheese","I will start off by stating my bias....that I generally hate Bollywood movies because of their excesses, and their general lack of realism.In that light, Devdas is classic Bollywood. The cinematography is nice, the costumes...superb, the actors ...look great, the drama....overly dramatic. And the story has been thoroughly North Indianized. For a Bengali like me, the selective use of Bengali in silly accents was useless, it should have simply not been there, because by being there it insults us. There are plenty of people who can do better Bengali with a little bit of coaching. And if the story is to be told in Hindi, keep it ALL Hindi.But it's the palace and the costumes that make this movie even weirder. Set in the early 20th Century, but seems almost like a movie about feuds between two royal households. Is Parvati supposed to have that gorgeous house she has? Can we actually see any semblance of colonial India in the movie?
In sum, the movie is "pretty", a dressed up and showy theatrical piece that fails to translate anything from Chatterjee's novel (metaphorically, forget the Bengali). It's the perfect piece of saffronized Indian export that, no doubt, many international critics will love because they can almost smell the incense. It reminds me of Mira Nair's costume drama called Kama Sutra, which unfortunately, was just as comparably bad (considering the audience it catered to). It fails to build empathy for the characters, and for us to understand Devdas. Characters seem to choose madness and make life a deliberate disaster for themselves for the heck of it. Devdas could have been compared to Hamlet, but this movie makes that comparison unworthy. There is nothing groundbreaking in this movie (other than its expenditure) to deserve the attention it is getting. It continues the Bollywood tradition of one-dimensional characters.THE GOOD STUFF: the pretty faces of Aishwarya and Madhuri. Both respectable. It was entertaining to see Jackie Shroff succumb to stupid roles. And there were a few good songs (and dances) that wasn't the usual pelvic thrusting soft-core dance acts."
