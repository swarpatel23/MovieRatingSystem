" Excellent film! Great direction, acting and story! Don't listen to the critics!","They rarely make a film with true talent and substance in Bollywood these days. A lot of Bollywood has just become a senseless over-production of childish comedy, over the top action and sleazy "item songs". No one pays attention to direction, acting, storyline and dialogues anymore. But Hamari Adhuri Kahani has ALL the ingredients of a genuine film that will touch your heart. Emran Hashmi displays one of his best acting performances in a romantic and emotional role. He has successfully played a character that you would usually expect from someone like Shah Rukh Khan. Vidya Balan is equally impressive. She convincingly makes you believe that she is a woman stuck in the situation portrayed in the film. Yet the overpowering strength of the film is the fresh storyline, powerful dialogues and gripping direction. The connection with the audiences is so strong that it really makes you feel for the characters and will almost push you to tears. The songs and background music of the film are the pleasant icing on the cake. If you want to appreciate a great romantic film that will truly appeal to your emotions, PLEASE go and watch this movie! You will not be disappointed!!" 
" Sensitive story of every woman","It is a story of real Indian woman. Not the liberated, modern and independent woman but every other girl who despite being educated and employeed is buried under the tag of being a daughter, mother and wife. It tells real story of how difficult it is for them to find and feel love. It is a very sensitive movie and needs understanding of human pain and emotion. It is not some fun, masti, timepass movie for so called modern people who find everything traditional regressive. It shows the real situation not some make belief happy world. Yes, it is dialogue heavy and little filmy but that is expected of an emotional love story. Brilliant. Watch it." 
" What's with all the negativity? The movie is freaking awesome <3","A Spoiler Free Review : First of all, let me tell you, I'm a Hollywood buff, but I love occasional Bolly stuff too of which my favorites being A Wednesday, Ek Chalis Ki Last Local, Rockstar, ZNMD, Fanaa, Ishqiya, Udaan, Dev D, Bheja Fry.. and some of them more. Well, I don't know why, but I chose Hamari Adhuri Kahaani to watch over Jurassic World(I'll watch that too, later :p), and Oh Boy! Did I made the right decision. The movie is just fantastic, ek villain didn't impressed me at all(the songs were the ones which dragged it's so called 'success') But Aashiqui 2 was kind of good with some major plot holes, & the same goes with this one. I'm not implying that, Hamari Adhuri Kahani is one of a kind, It has many clichÃ© moments, but the way Mohit opted to narrate the story, caught me into it.This movie is purely performance driven. Vidya Balan stole my heart with her innocence but I've been a fan of her acting skills since Kahaani anyways. Rajkummar Rao delivering a top notch performance And Emraan Hashmi stole the show, I'm not gonna publicly admit that i cried every time he had tears in his eyes, I'm not gonna do that :pAll in all guys, this movie is packed with a hardhitting story, with an amazing climax (ignore the one's who are criticizing it, watch it for yourself & then judge it), the atmosphere (locations) serves as an eyecandy including the songs which gave me goosebumps, literally every time when the tittle track went on. The movie is made for a Silver Screen so do watch it there. Worth ever penny, you'll love it :)" 
" Excellent Movie and Touching.","This movie is an excellent piece of story. I cannot better rate this movie. I am compelled to write this review due to the touching nature of this movie. Emraan Hashmi's impeccable performance and lovely story. It reminds you the importance of love and how the Indian society and community needs to steer its mentality from the illogical, stupid and ruthless mindset of old times. Take everyone in your family to watch this movie. The movie has very good story plot. It's not an illogical movie plot. The best part of the movie was that there limited songs as stupid movies have many songs to fool audience. This movie had 2-3 songs only at places where the scene demanded it and your heart wanted it. Mohit suri could not do a better job at directing an emotional movie that is universally rated with Emraan Hashmi in it. Go with a positive mind and you will truly appreciate this movie." 
" Love is blind but beautiful as here the lead actor fell in love with a florist.","Mind blowing picture,the way hashmi express his love is just speechless..all couples must watch this movie as they can only find it meaningful..mature roles has been played here with deep meanings.A very nice story directed by Mohit suri ,worth watching it."Tera bin bole samajh Jana" -great job Emraan hashmi,love u for this performance.The dilemma part in Vidya balan's life in this movie when she came to know that her husband is a terrorist n she has to inform police whenever she gets even a call from him to help them to arrest him,there she acts beautifully. Hashmi dialog are so powerful that drives your attention.Those Adam lily flowers will be now mostly preferred by the love birds in the city ..haha...i too went to check out its fragrance as d movie reflects them so convincing.Well don't miss this movie guys ,a new philosophy,a new script has been brought down beautifully on screen..:) :)" 
" Don't judge by the overall rating. Must Watch!","Actually even i had lost a bit of interest after looking at the overall rating. But i was awed after i actually watched it. The music is soothing, it brings a tear or two. I still have the effect in me. Honestly i wish this story was published as a book. It would have contained a lot of insight and more weight. But still, Mohit Suri has done a hell of a job. One of the recent best emotional movie I'v watched this is. Some of the scenes would just pinch a muscle in the heart, thanks to the music and contents of the scene. Bollywood is improving, what with the kinds of films like YJHD. Even though the ending of Ashiqui 2 had me in disappointment, the story telling and acting put up in this movie just made me register for IMDb and write a review. Emraan Hashmi, with his love-felt looks, brings out the pain of a person who hadn't felt love, and covered by the money he has. Rajkumar Rao is outstanding. I like his movies. His acts are subtle. Brings out the character and hasn't failed to do so in the movie. He makes us cry with his innocence in the 'real time' of the story. Vidya Balan is cute. I'd rather tell sweet. Conveys the plot perfectly. Overall it is a must watch for movie buffs who wouldn't want a movie to end. Thank You." 
" Simply amazing ( it started off a bit slow but overall loved it )","my brother watched and recommended it to me though he spoiled the ending for me and i just lost interest in the movie since i don't like these type of movies but after seeing a lot of people throwing some good comments on this in instagram i decided to give it a watch... the movie was absolutely amazing ,, very sad and heart touching and this is coming from a guy who doesn't even like these genre of movies haha no matter what genre of movies you are into, you will love this movie ! there were a few minor errors in the movie but that doesn't make it any less amazing enjoy the movie ! 10/10.. the end don't read next lines sad and heart touching and this is coming from a guy who doesn't even like these genre of movies haha no matter what genre of movies you are into, you will love this movie ! there were a few minor errors in the movie but that doesn't make it any less amazing enjoy the movie !" 
" Very touching love story","A very touching love story.. An unconditional love beyond the institution of marriage and society.. Watch this movie for beautiful story , great performance by the protagonists. I never liked Imran Hashmi till I watched this movie. I think he did a fabulous job and he looks cool in those business suits.. As usual Vidya Balan gives stunning performance as Vasudha.. She can get into any character very easily..she looks beautiful in the sarees. At some point you will predict the story, even then you will enjoy watching the movie for its simplicity in depicting this sensitive story. Kudos to the music director jeet ganguly for melodious songs which go very well with the movie..somehow all Imran hashmi movies end up getting awesome sound tracks. Hmmm.. The title song steals your heart.. Arijit Singh's magical voice makes u want to hear that song again and again. Good direction and all in all a nice movie.. Would recommend to all who like emotional and romantic movies." 
" Brilliant performance by Emraan Hashmi","Such a romantic movie. Music will touch your heart. dialogue are excellent and sometimes will make you cry. Vidya always good. She proved that still now she is better than all the young actress of bollywood.The best part of the movie is Emraan Hashmi. The way he delivered the dialogue with so much emotions its speechless. He is definitely one of the best actor in Bollywood now.Wow such a brilliant performance.don't know why it got so less star. But it worth of watching.yes direction is bit weak. But who cares about the the little negative points when its such a beautiful movie.loved watching the movie." 
" Emran rocks, unconvincing climax, overall one time watchable for the dialogues and performances!","First of all let me tell you that in the afternoon show of this movie, which doesn't have any Khan or Kumar in it, the house was full. Yeah, it's not convincing but it is true. The whole theater was full, especially with the youngsters. This clearly shows that Music hit, to Movie hit! Mohit Suri is popular for making films which are more related to the youngsters and especially the couples. The songs become popular before the movie release. He is the same director who made Ashiqui2 which became super hit without any stars and Ek Villain which collected 100cr at the box office without any storyline. So he rejoins the Bhatt camp and convince Mahesh Bhatt to write the story. Because of the family project, Emran Hashmi and Rajkumar Rao had been finalized for the respected roles. And Vidya Balan is selected because of the suggestion of Mahesh Bhatt. And then first of all, they create the soulful soundtrack. They even bought the song Zaroori Tha from Rahat Fateh Ali Khan for the better success of the album. Thus the film began to start! Story line is not refreshing. Old wine has been served in new bottle. But, the stars make the bottle a worthy drink. Undoubtedly, everyone will talk about Emran Hashmi after the movie. Though Vidya Balan is also fantastic and Rajkumar Rao also acts well. But, he is not convincing as a terrorist, or as an old man or as the husband of Vidya Balan. Vidya looks perfect for the role. But, it is Emran who makes the audience cry, who makes the audience to feel sad for him through his eyes, especially where tears come out from them. Music is outstanding. The best song that suits in it is Zaroori Tha. Title track is awesome. Jeet Ganguly once again proved that he can give the best! Last paragraph of that song is playing in the climax where Rao throws ashes in the garden, is the best scene with full emotions. Hasi and Hamnawa are also listenable. Dialogues are another plus point. The film is majorly dependent on Hashmi's powerful dialogues. Cinematography is as usual as we had seen in Suri's previous movies. Story looks good till interval, even after post interval, too. But, I don't convince with the climax and its twist. I'm hoping for something good for all, but, Suri only loves not so happy ending. This film shows the true love between two persons, so the Girlfriend-Boyfriend type people may not like this film. I'm saying so because I've watched some faces after the movie. On the whole, you can watch it once if you are a fan of Emran Hashmi or even Mohit Suri. I think it's better than Mohit's last 3-4 releases. But than also only Emran steals the show. This is his first U certified film, so family audience can also go for it. Hamari Adhuri Kahani can make only one difference and that is the return of Emran Hashmi!" 
" Emraan Hashmi made it worth watching","Hamari Adhuri Kahani is a kind of movie that is worth watching only because of its music and Emraan Hashmi. Mohit Suri's direction is as expected superb. Music is already hit and love to hear in cinema hall. Some dialogs are awesome and you'll love them more when they come from Emraan's mouth with awesome expressions.Emraan Hashmi is speechless this time. You'll love him in every scene. He is totally brilliant in every scene. Vidya Balan is nice too. Rajkumar Rao as expected he always put a smile in audience's face when with his acting. Other supportive actors have done nice job too.I don't know why this movie got less ratings but i enjoyed it whenever Emraan Hashmi is on screen. Music and background score help to connect audiences with the soul of the screenplay and story.Overall,forget what reviews this movie got just go and fall in love like Aarav Ruparel. Emraan Hashmi played a character about which you'll not stop thinking after coming from cinema hall." 
" In the era where all the movie rotate around stunts and stupid songs,A different movie which shows what really LOVE IS.","In the era where all the movie rotate around stunts and stupid songs,A different movie which shows what really LOVE IS.After a long time i felt something in my heart feeling love inside most of them wont like this movie as they are addicted to the stunts,sexy songs,stupid jokes and crazy things.This movie focuses on LOVE and Mercy to others...Should watch one time. I liked the song Hasi and the Title song.Story is between the rituals and love.Plot: Five years after the mysterious disappearance of her husband, a woman becomes romantically involved with a wealthy hotelier and together they confront her past.Though there are some errors but ignorable." 
" Well worth taking the pride of the ticket ...","From the trailers and songs , most of the movie is sorta guessed at. A sad / tragic love story , the question remains it has been handled well by the scriptwriters , the director etc.The answer is a resounding yes. This is Mohit Suri's forte and he has elicited a fantastic performance from Emraan , Vidya. In particular this is Emraan's movie , his eyes speak volumes in his scenes. The music is well placed. The characters are not black or white , but grey, with their self motivations. It's worth the money of the ticket. Go for it ..." 
" A decent story, let down by silly gaffes due to silly gaffes and weak first half","What works:1. The core story - though on the surface, it seems to be a clichÃ© around love, sacrifice and longing, it has it's soul in the right place. 2. Great performances by Vidya Balan and Rajkumar Rao. Where it fails:1. Fist half is too weak. Too many intertwined sub-plots and connected stories take long to setup the premise. 2. Lack of attention to obvious details: Majority of the story is in flashback, set 21 years back from today, which means it's set in 1994. Yet you get to see Samsung mobiles with front facing cameras, characters taking and sharing selfies, and worst of the lot, mobile internet and lightening fast internet in the midst of a jungle which can send a video file through in 5 secs!Overall, a lost opportunity to create a good evergreen movie due to silly mistakes and gaps in script-writing...." 
" An Excellent Movie To Watch","What's better than watching a classy movie on a weekend in your bed alone. Its a movie that one can say is composed of the very true and pure emotions, that depict the reality of life.Best Lines:i) "Nothing in this world is perfect without imperfections" P.S God has made everything on purpose. ii) "You can't love until you stop being selfish, Love is about giving away its not an ordinary trade" iii) "Love is a responsibility not everyone can take it".Best Scene: Imran Hashmi giving his life in lily garden.I gave 10 to this movie it impressed me on every ground that's the reason why I haven't left watching Bollywood movies because they occasionally produce a real master piece and its one of themHAMARI ADHURI KAHANI (Y)" 
" This made me realize what True love is !!!","Being an avid English movie viewer, I was rather a pessimist to watch this movie.What started out as a lazy couch potato movie turned out to be one of the most loved movies by me. I never expected that love could be shown in such beautiful ways.The manner in which the male protagonist has portrayed the emotions and the feel of it is unexplainable. The way in which the director has captured the essence of emotions is truly remarkable.I would truly recommend this movie a watch.If you really want to fall in love again this is the movie you should watch.Vidya does a fantastic job with her portrayal of sadness and love. i could relate to the pain in Emran's eyes.It was too good to be true."
