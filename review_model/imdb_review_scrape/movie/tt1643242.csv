" A potential plot gets a childish treatment.","With few reputed names associated with many meaningful movies in the past, RIVAAZ looked like something interesting talking about a new subject in Hindi Cinema. It no doubt has a bold and fresh subject to offer in terms of its story-plot, but as a film it fails completely on the execution level without making any kind of impact on the viewer. In cinematic terms it's a very amateurish kind of attempt made on the controversial theme of "Traditional Prostitution" being practiced in a village. And its first few sequences itself give you a precise idea about how the subject is going to be tackled by the director in its later reels. So, the film is neither able to connect with the audience, right from its first frame nor it is capable enough of giving any kind of message to the viewers about the evil tradition.The script keeps jumping from one sequence to another ignoring its basic element called "Continuation". The characters go through such sudden heart transformations that the viewer feels confused about film's basic storyline. Particularly the romance between the lead couple seems to be all artificial and deliberate which brings down the whole spirit of the movie drastically. In short, there is nothing in the film which is able to support its otherwise interesting subject. The characterizations are so weak that even the veteran actors such as Deepti Naval look like fresh entrants in the field. But there is one positive thing which I would surely like to mention here regarding its director Ashok Kumar Nanda who certainly had a potential plot in his hand which could have been exploited in a much better way. Now though the director was not able to make the best use of his well selected subject, still he never tries to take advantage of its sexual plot, anywhere in his film. It indeed speaks a lot about the moral character of the director as he never uses "Skin-Show" in his scenes to get some more audiences in the theaters. Since it is a film talking about "a Village where females are involved in flesh trade as their ages old tradition", hence it was damn easy to convert it into a C grade sexual venture which could have easily earned more money in the interiors. But the director Ashok Kumar Nanda never falls down to that downgrade way of selling his film and makes a clean project made on subject of Prostitution, which is not an easy task in today's commercially lead world desperately looking for a good initial weekend to earn some quick money.However as a movie experience, RIVAAZ is not worth watching at all due to its childish treatment of a strong subject." 
" Worth Giving a Watch !","This is a movie which proves that there are people who still dares to bring the dark side of the society to the eye of the common man.Looks Like Good Film makers are back in town. A new approach to a classic topic makes one hold into the entire duration of the film.The new breed director Ashok Nanda has managed the top class and tough actors very well where there were no much scope of exposure for each character in an underdeveloped script.This Film is for selected category viewers who enjoy to watch something different and realistic.Couple of songs could have been reduced to maintain the original flavor of the film's genre. However songs are of good taste.background music is too loud and clumsy and spoils the taste of the theme. Such type of movie needs more silence than noise in scenes if viewer involvement is expected.worth giving a watch as it will show you something unexpected picture of our superficial society." 
" Penetrating , Shocking....","Rivvaz is a good attempt to bring up an issue to the people who think we are a part of developed country with high cultural value we boast all the time.It is about Family based prostitution where male members of the family serve as pimps to female members.The writers have come up with a fast paced story. This must have been a difficult thing to do as the whole story is set up in just one village. Some dialogues are really penetrating 'Rivaaz' has some melodious songs , which are no lesser than any other Hindi film's love song. 'Rivaaz' wins hearts in its message. The film does not supply any ready made solution to a long established problem, but it emphasizes on the value of self emancipation from the worldly chains. It rightly explains the reasons behind the plight of women trapped in flesh business. The climax of the film is shot well and fits appropriately to a story which basically explores the possible way out of the prostitution business. In spite of flaws (as every movie got), 'Rivaaz' is a film which should not be condemned for not having big star cast and better production values. One can definitely watch the film for a story which is true for many parts of our country even today.With a little more cinematic effort it could have turned to a landmark cinema in bollywood lately made.Verdict: Good Cinema without big commercial value." 
" Good Make, Daring Effort, Agaist All Odds","This is something Abnormal. Everyone including me who watched this film are appreciating the movie inspite of the hardness of the film.This is an Example of how a movie of such a bold subject can be made without unnecessary vulgarity and nudity.Eventough it is Adult certified there were many family and female viewers in the theater.Good Movie, good direction , Good Songs bad languages used could have been milder.Films like this does not come every now and then. But with a little more effort from the director it could have been a film to showcase.Watch it guys.." 
" Thumbs Up !!","Hardhitting movie. You need to have guts to sit for 2 hrs to watch the movie. unbelievable but true that it is still happening is some part of the world not only in India.Wake up call for Females to fight for their own rights. Good effort from the director. reminds me of some extraordinary art movies of the past such as "chakra", "Arth".It takes a dare effort to make such a film. Hats off to the actors. Everyone Shines.The guy in the pimp role is excellent. overall worth a watch. good cinematography. Young actors could have done better"
