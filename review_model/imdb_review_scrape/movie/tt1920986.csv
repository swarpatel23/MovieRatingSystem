" One of the worst Hindi film","After seeing this movie,I am not able to understand when film producer and director like Mr. K.C.Bokadia will mature and learn to make any meaningful or at least somewhat entertaining movie.all his movies are totally meaningless.Be it Lal badshaah,maidan-e-jung or shaktiman.He simply thinks that people will go and watch meaningless action which have no script at all.I only watched this film completely just to see and laugh how bad a movie can be made.movie has stupid script,bad dialogues,Editing is probably so worst that some of the movie scenes look completely absurd. some of the finest actor of bollywood like Sunny deol,Tabu are totally wasted and are made to look bad and overact by The director.I just don't understand if Mr. Bokadia has no talent as a Director or writer,why don't he just sit and work as a producer only.by seeing this film anyone can tell that director and writer (both happens to be Mr. Bokadia in this film)has just written and shot whatever has come to his mind,he didn't have any script ready.Bollywood has recently matured enough giving its viewers matured and meaningful movies but still there exist some of the director who continue to make movies with childish script with absurd action be it Mr.Bokadia or Rajkumar kohli (who few years back made another mindless film known as Jaani Dushman:Ek anokhi kahani).I don't know when these kind of Directors will mature and understand what is the meaning of entertainment in modern era.they still continue to make films based on a script as they were doing in 80's and 90's." 
" Who made this amateurish production?","This is such an amateurish film, I really wonder how anyone in the present day world could come up with this idea.It is meant to be a political action thriller, but the direction is so childish, as if some kid has directed it.The editing is weak, there aren't even any good songs, action is sub standard, and there are some unbelievable things, like Sunny Deol pulling out his own teeth!Probably some of the actors like Tabu have no better work now. That's why they opted to act in this, perhaps out of desperation to get some offer at least!I don't recommend wasting your time on this, but if you don't believe me, then watch this. At least you can laugh a while!" 
" The Challenge","In 2006 there was a promo of a film THE CHALLENGE which had Sunny and Tabu which never released for some reason. In 2010 suddenly a film releases under the name KHUDA KASAM which is the same film with a different title. The film has an age-old trite concept done to death and looks no better in 2010 when such films are already done to death.The plot is stale and so is the film, In fact perhaps it was delayed due to no takers for a Sunny film.Direction is nothing great Music is nothing greatSunny Deol just repeats his style, Tabu doesn't have much to do and is wasted Govind Namdeo, Mukesh Rishi, Danny are as usual Farida Jalal too is there as usual as the mother"
