" Good, thought-provoking film","This movie has a shocking subject--child rape.  The scene and aftermath of the 9 year-old's rape is disturbing.  What shocked me even more is that this subhuman act happens often.  The director is excellent as all the actors gave wonderful performances.  This is another feather in Raveena's cap of sensational art movies.  After Daman and Satta, she once again does a terrific job in her powerful role.  She does a good job of portraying maternal love and instincts.  Manoj Bajpai also did a great job.  Sanjay Kapoor acted well for a change.  It was interesting how this obviously, vehemently immoral act became intertwined with the political scene and how politicians were utilizing this tragedy for selfish reasons.  I am glad there were no songs in this film as they had no place and would have just disrupted the flow of the movie." 
" A Sublime Drama.","There is not much douwdt that Raveena Tandon and Sanjeev Kapoor are few of the finer actors of the Indian Cinema. The emotion they display of the agony of a couple in their situation is laudable. Then there is Manoj Bajpai as the detective-a slice of good acting. The drama is well chronicled and narrated.In retrospect this tragedy could have been prevented. This is a classic story of silence and apathy that is prevalent in a Metropolis like Mubai-almost as if there is a price to pay for living there. All in all this is a watchable Pic. Some of the scenes make you cringe, which is aftermath of knowing that this was a real story. There is enormous talent that is yet to be tapped especially in Directors and screen-writing. This is a sad but well portrayed story with the best of the lot being Raveena who has the immaculate style, a natural poise and a clear diction." 
" shocking poignant","Bollywood has been trapped into its cycle of optimism and confetti with only the occasional drama and Satajit Ray showing realism. The rape scene is unforgivably repeated through the film in an attempt to increase impact. Instead it descends it into melodrama and exploitation. Thius is redeemed by the director's work in the film and the excellent acting of the castIt is courageous of an actress like Raveena who is known for her glamorous cosmopolitan films and some nude shoots to demand scripts of more weight and importance when film companies are relying on her for glamorous and populist entertainment. Moving more into art films she portrays maternal love well. Her combination of two different styles has been noted outside of India. Here in Britain an actor and scientist called Stephen Armourae has applauded her work in an article on acting in Indian cinema. Equally impressed by her glamour he also produced one or more portraits of her. The film has impetus since it is based on a true story and the screen writers recognise this in an outstanding and sophisticated script. Its purpose is an indictment against apathy and indifference to violence and suffering that often appears in cities."
