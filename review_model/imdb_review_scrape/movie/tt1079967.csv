" The Biggest Waste of Time and Money","Because there are no zeroes and some people did some hard work to make this movie, I would give it 3. The whole movie is waste. A repeatedly told story about a brilliant and intelligent Hero, a beautiful girl in her life and then a third lady who would do anything to spoil their life. The comedy is not laughable at all. It seemed like everybody is being forced to act and speak dialogues. Worst ever comedy by Rajpal Yadav. Jimmy's act was better. Both the girls acting as Maya and Tanvi were waste. Somethings completely horrible. Who would trust a fresh graduate with 10 million USD to start a call centre in India? Rajpal Yadav was a complete headache." 
" A movie whose entire reel should have been left on the cutting floor...","I really feel bad about reviewing this movie as there is absolutely nothing good that I could find to write about that would lessen all the bad things. This is the kind of movie that belongs in the 70s and the kind that reaffirms my belief that Indian movies are shallow hollowed out husks.There is no production value to the film- the editing is poor, the acting is poor and the storyline is a complete shambles. The pace is slow, predictable, painful and erratic.Jimmy Shergill looks old and tired throughout the movie, not to mention a bit bored. There was no effort at all from him. Worse off his motions are robotic and mind numbing. He gets as close as he can to Sunny Deol, a grandmaster of wooden and one dimensional acting. The two main girls are terrible- the girl acting as Maya did nothing but whine on every phone call and her voice was annoying. The one who acted as Taanvi was worse, looking like a cheap slut in every scene and yet she's supposed to be an intelligent modern and professional working woman. But this professional woman likes to dance in clubs, take long baths while wearing full makeup and wear nothing but men's shirts...There is no way to gain back the hour and half I spent watching the movie...thankfully it was only that long because shortly after the interval I watched the rest of the movie in fast forward mode (at max speed). In actuality this movie should get a 0 star rating but since IMDb doesn't have it I had to give 1 (though 0.5 would have been better).Who should watch this? No one." 
" It's nice movie","This movie was so entertaining by seeing full of comedy scenes of the film Nice movie to watch brilliant storyline amazing performances from my favorite actor who I am always a fan of Jimmy shergill is superb as the hero rajpal was brilliant this movie was outstanding I saw triple role was the best part Songs are good it makes me feel good and the movie title makes me happy always Nice one direction good music good editing good screenplay good Nothing is negative everything is positive" 
" 2 thumbs up !","Great comedy ..with nice songs and visuals -Loved it ! Neel (Jimmy Sheirgill), a brilliant student at Columbia University and the pretty Maya (Nisha Rawal) the love of his life, are on the verge of starting a new life together in New York. Sunny Malhotra (Rajpal Yadav) is Neel's roommate, teammate and best buddy. Academically challenged and a compulsive flirt, he gets involved in a series of hilarious situations with his American love Tina (Sarah Thomas).Just when life seems perfect, Neel accepts a career opportunity that requires him to go to India to set up a business. Much against Maya's wishes Neel travels to India with Sunny.Tanvi (Monishka) is a young executive who goes out of her way to help Neel and his team in India. Attractive & aggressive she is instantly attracted to Neel and tries her best to win his heart. Neel being deeply in love with Maya rejects Tanvi. Now seeking revenge, Tanvi creates a trap which leads Neel into deep trouble professionally and personally.Will Tanvi succeed in her plans? Will Neel win Maya's heart again? Will Neel succeed in clearing his name from all the accusations? Hastey Hastey is a youthful, musical, romantic comedy with a twist in the tale" 
" What a waste","I think Shivaram Kumar woke up one morning and said: "I think I'll make a movie" and Hastey Hastey ended up being the awful result of that idea.This movie reeks of superficial situations, simple dialogue, and an overall lack of substance or depth to characters or storyline. Essentially, all it has going for it is some decent cinematography, and physical attractiveness of the actors/actresses....all superficial things once again.I'm inclined to believe that the whole purpose of this movie was to get all of the 'Quixbots' out there "Fired Up!!" and to put across the impression that only in Quixtar/Amway will you be safe from all of the Maya type characters out there in the real world.Well, let this movie be an example that money isn't everything. Just because you throw enough money at producing a movie, it doesn't mean that people will watch it.... let alone find it tolerable." 
" Yikes! My eyes hurt!","Awful would not be a strong enough word for this movie. First off, I wanted to jump in the screen and turn down Jimmy Shergill's collar and button his shirt. Who thought that would make him look cool? (It didn't, it made him look stupid and superficial.) Every song and dance was cheap, low budget and bad. And anyone with a vague familiarity with the US could tell that once again, different cities were being passed off as New York and really awful British actors/actresses were being passed off as Americans. It took me 2 weeks to watch this 2 hour atrocity. I had to keep pausing because it was so horrible. The script was bad, the acting worse, the plot ridiculous and the side story (with Rajpal Yadav) dumb. Even the clothing designs were ridiculous, making the "so-called" American females (the ones with British accents) look like street walkers in every scene. What a waste of time and money. Any participation in a film like this in Hollywood would be a career ender."
