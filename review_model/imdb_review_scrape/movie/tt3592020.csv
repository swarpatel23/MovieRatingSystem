" The type of movie where a ghost comes and you show your "om" locket. Fire comes out from the om locket and the ghost runs away","Horror films in Bollywood can be divided into two types. The A grades and C grades. This one belongs to the latter. Cheesy and ridiculous story,hilarious songs and poor VFX. There was a time when these movies used to actually work. But this is 2014. Even the remaining niche fans have vanished. Its not a horror but comedy movie. I watched it in a B grade theater in my city and it was good to see even Rickshawallahs and day labours cursing this movie.It was shocking to see Shakti Kapoor as a horror story writer, but provided some relief among the other unknown actors. Watch this movie with your friends and you'll have a great time."
