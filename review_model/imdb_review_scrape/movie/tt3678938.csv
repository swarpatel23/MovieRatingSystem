" Old Wine in a Styrofoam Cup","Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania has a "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" (DDLJ) Hangover. Well no this isn't the Bradley Cooper infused - "Now I am gonna enjoy this for the next two hours" kind of Hangover. But rather the kind that causes headaches and makes you hate yourself for throwing up - not just your money, but also time, that you could have surely spent elsewhere.The story goes like this - wait - there was a story? Well yes there was one you see! Someone watched DDLJ. Convinced Karan Johar that now is the time to milk DDLJ, and irrespective of the daring "Neil and Nikki" vanishing off without a trace, Karan actually agreed to fund this! The film, to give credit where its due, has totally done away with logic - thus saving us some more pain in trying to link the sequences happening purposelessly in scene after scene. Sample this - a drunk girl decides to stay back with 3 drunk men she hardly knows in a commercial establishment, claiming that its late at night and risky outside. Now that's what I call logic empowerment! Wait! There is more! Amateurs shoot videos of lovers having sex, blackmail them for money (after all, one is an unhappily married MILF and the other young enough to be her son), and actually end up committing the perfect crime! If that isn't innovation at its best, I don't know what is! Wait - wondering where DDLJ comes into play? Here it goes - This film you see is essentially about the heroine - Alia Bhatt falling for a random stranger even after having her marriage fixed with someone she regularly interacts with on Skype. Of course all men she Skypes with look hot, can you blame her for not being sure about this one? And yes, she needs to buy a Designer Ghagra, and save a dear friend from getting blackmailed, and earn some fast money, and evaluate some exam papers, and be a good Samaritan to a man who always dreamed of buying a car, and look fresh, and dance at weddings, and pout, and effortlessly say some dialogs that were surely written with least effort, and basically do a lot of unnecessary running around in between.Still wondering how it is inspired by DDLJ? Don't worry! There is of course an interval, post which the hero - Varun Dhawan tries winning the heroine DDLJ style even as a 'gabru jawaan' - Siddharth Shukla - the only character who actually stays in character and has a semblance of logic - plays a spoilsport by being perfect in every way possible.The only thing that works for the film is possibly the song "Saturday Saturday" - which has the power of actually eclipsing the impact of the William Pharrell Song "Happy", for the moment it comes on screen, you realize that the film is at last over and believe me! Nothing will make you happier!P.S: There is a scene in the film where Varun breaks down inconsolably upon reading a message on his phone; and the audience breaks down in an attempt at controlling their laughter. I am not sure whether Varun had managed to glimpse the fate of this film while shooting that scene. 3 out of 10 stars from me, for the technicians who added the required sheen, for the song 'Samjhawan' and for Siddharth Shukla who did not let go of an opportunity of showcasing his skills. But I so wish Alia had chosen better..." 
" Anurag Kashyap Ki Dulhania","The poster of 'Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania' is a 'selfie', aptly depicting the brutally modern times we live in. On face value it is a 'popcorn' tribute to 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', but at a deeper level it is an ode with a sociological twist and a candid introspection of our modern times. It as much a reflection of Aditya Chopra's opus as it is of new age auteurs like Anurag Kashyap. It is juxtaposition of the old-world simplicity and modern-day savagery. We live in tough times. We live in brutal times. Modern society is full of contradictions and paradoxes. We live in a society that champions libertarian socialism, yet is consumerist to the core. Kavya won't settle for anything less than a 500,000-rupee wedding dress. But she has the cheek and the enterprise to raise the required money. Perfection is new-age imperfection: in other words, being perfect is a sin and being flawed is a virtue in the modern society. Kavya rejects Angad, who is better than Humpty in every way. He is a doctor; he rakes more money; he has more brawn and brains; he can dance; he is rational; he has better social and clubbing skills. In simple terms, he is an ideal man who withstands her father's meticulous quest for her prospective husband. But despite that, it is Humpty who charms Kavya with his glaring flaws.Like any self-conscious modern film, it pays obeisance to Facebook. It, however, saves Humpty from proffering the silly colloquial 'I want to do friendship with you' to her. Instead, Facebook provides him a subtle approach to take things forward. Their transition from friends to lovers is seamless without any melodrama or jingoistic lines, which would have been must in the nineties.Both films deal with facets of patriarchy. In 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', Amrish Puri was a strict patriarch, marching in austerity; assertive, yet without any violent tendency. The patriarch here, Ashutosh Rana, from his humble beginnings as a mechanic, is now a rich and powerful transport honcho. The father-daughter relationship is relaxed. She's daddy's princess, pampered and over-protected by the typical modern-day big poppa daddy. But he can impose his preferences on her when it comes to her marriage, because he believes that his choice would be better for her in the long run. The patriarch knows that he is not a perfect husband to his wife, but he aspires to be a perfect daddy, even if it means overriding his daughter's volition. A snooty Philistine like him does not read books, but one can expect him to have posters of Bajrang Dal or Noam Chomsky in his closet. Unlike the patriarch in 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', he can be violent, not towards his daughter, but towards any 'unsanctioned' suitor. He sends Humpty and friends packing in a truck, battered savagely by his sycophants.Humpty is a run-of-the-mill exponent of yuppie breed, who any average six-pack Joe can relate to. Like modern-day heroes he digs it out in the gym and proudly possesses six-pack abs. Many social commentators look askance at the shaved torsos and muscular physiques of modern heroes, questioning their masculinity. In the past, heroes didn't need gymnasiums to exhibit machismo: hirsuteness was an emblem of masculinity. But things have changed. So have the ethos of machismo. Moreover, the parameters of modern masculinity are tougher, as drudging machinery in the gym calls for hard work and dedication, compared to having follicular growth on chest that requires no talent or effort. He swears by Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge's philosophies. And he strips himself of dignity at the patriarch's behest, ready to undergo an excoriating examination. In spirit he is a younger version of the patriarch. His deportment and methods different but his ideologies are the same as his. When Kavya decides to elope with him, his paternal instinct kicks in and he persuades her to stay under the patriarch's aegis. In spite of his tender exterior, Humpty is a savage at heart. When his desperate attempts at nitpicking Angad fail, he almost gives up, but Kavya's wit saves him. She artfully incites Angad to pick a fight with a lecherous hooligan at the dhaba. But Angad, instead of getting in a mad-cap brawl, calmly calls the police; whereas, the frantic Humpty, desperate to outdo Angad, throws himself on the hooligans.Although the patriarch sees himself in the savage Humpty, he is too brutal a pragmatist to let his emotions take over logic. Although the patriarch himself was a mechanic when he got married, he still cannot let his princess marry a stranger with rickety finances. Humpty is too big a risk for him. Like every big poppa daddy, he seeks a better life for his daughter than he did for his wife.The climax has an oneiric feel â€” a salute to Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver'. The drunken Humpty is howling on the eve of Kavya's wedding. Then suddenly the patriarch emerges to bless his approval for Humpty. It's likely to be Humpty's histrionic imagination. The schmaltzy Humpty, deeply inspired by 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', always hankered for the patriarch's blessings. It is a very dream-like scene. Then Kavya's standing on a truck, calling Humpty, is another surreal moment. Angad's abrupt dismissal seems amiss; it is again Humpty's imagination, which has no room for Angad. Humpty's dream is an idealistic climax, his solace to his quest for Kavya, but alas, idealism has no room in Humpty's brutal modern society." 
" Goodbye Dharma productions.","Some movies are made with passion while some movies are made to make money out of it. Humpty falls in the second category. Since, Alia and Varun are the current youth icons, the young generation is crazy for them and they do watch their films in theaters just because they both are good looking, Karan Johor thought that why not rope in these two actors and make a very mainstream but glamorous movie and make money?! Both Alia and Varun are overrated and so is their movie. And the irony is that, while promoting this movie, they said that Humpty is gonna be the new DDLJ and KKHH which I don't agree. DDLJ and KKHH were iconic movies. Humpty is just another SOTY. I am sure, this movie will make money. People will love this film BUT, it will only be the dumb ones to love this film. Intelligent people won't have this film in their list of favorite movies. I would recommend you to not watch the movie. Definitely a waste of time but also you will come out of the theaters irritated and flooded with the thoughts that if Alia and Varun can be superstars then why cant I be one?!" 
" One of the most ridiculous and most overrated films EVER!","I am usually pretty lenient with films and rarely find films to be THIS bad. But Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania takes some of the most overused concepts in Bollywood films and puts it in one film. While the movie may be able to make money, it is definitely not the DDLJ of this decade - and it's far from it. The story line is absolute garbage, and the actors are not able to make up for it. Yes, both Alia and Varun look great in the film, but I personally do not care for their acting...other Despite being only slightly over two hours long, the movie felt like a drag to watch. Even the music is not up to par. The bottom line is that this movie does not live up to its hype and does no justice to Dharma Productions. Please save yourself the time, and if you are looking to watch a movie in the theater, go watch "Ek Villain" instead." 
" Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania movie review","I recently watched the movie "Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania".The movie is about the love story of a middle class boy and a middle class girl.Movie is directed by Debutant director Shashank Khaitan and produced by Karan Johar.It is a tribute to famous movie "DDLJ". it is a love story with modern behavior of the boy and the girl and their families.boy's role was played by Varun Dhawan as Humpty Sharma and girls role was played by Alia Bhatt as Kaya Pratap Singh.When Kavya ,a chirpy girl from Ambala, decides to make a trip to Delhi for her marriage shopping, she meets a young, carefree Delhi lad, Humpty Sharma. Humpty's father is the owner of a campus bookstore, where Humpty and his two best friends, Shonty and Poplu, have grown up together and which remains their hangout spot even now. Kavya is unattainable for Humpty initially, which makes her even more endearing to him. But being a Delhi boy, he is not the one to give up so easily. With some help from his two best friends, he finds out all about her and through an interesting turn of events (including a ploy to save Kavya's friend Gurpreet's marriage), they start growing closer to each other. The more time they spend with each other, their love-hate banter grows, but their chemistry is apparent. They are both different, yet very similar as people. They are young, feisty and carefree, and it's the spurge of life which attracts them to each other. As per plan, once Kavya's trip ends, she heads back to Ambala, knowing very well that her father, the very strict, yet loving Mr. Singh, would never accept her love for Humpty. But even though they both weren't looking for love, love happened.So Humpty,accompanied by his two friends, decides to go get Kavya. That's the beginning of a journey for him that he wouldn't have imagined undertaking even in the wildest of his dreams. Humpty, against all odds, decides to convince Kavya's family to agree to his alliance with her. How he does this and if he succeeds in his mission forms the rest of the story. Music in movie was very nice with super hit track "Saturday Saturday".Director has done considerable justice to story and screen play.Acting of characters is very entertaining.In short it is average movie with some good dialogs and character plays." 
" A homage to DDLJ but did anyone asked for one?","This movie doesn't hide the fact that it's paying a tribute to one of the best bollywood romantic movie ever made. The problem is since the release of DDLJ in 1995, countless movies have done the same. The lack of originality in the movie is pretty evident from the get go. Alia's father is against love marriage because his elder daughter's love marriage didn't work out. Ironically the father, played wonderfully by Ashutosh Rana, himself married love of his life. So it's hard to understand why he'd completely flip on the idea that love can lead to a successful marriage. Of course despite knowing her father's stance on love, she falls in one with Varun only a few weeks before her arranged marriage to a NRI. So begins Varun's effort to win over the father heart. If DDLJ was never released this movie probably wouldn't have looked so bad. Unfortunately when you know exactly how a movie is going to turn out, it takes away the joy of wonderment. I love Varun. I think he'll fit in wonderfully playing characters that need a blend of humour and action. Alia despite not being my favourite amongst the rush of newcomers, has potential to play wide range of characters. I think it's understandable that not all actors and actresses can find movies with unique storyline. This is especially difficult for newcomers who wants to do as many movies as they can to establish themselves in the industry but also wants to do good movies to establish their range and not be a typecast. Unfortunately unless the producers and directors decide to make good movies, it's the newcomers who'll face the problem of lack of creativity." 
" DDLJ of 2014","First of all, a note to the haters, who are thrashing the movie by saying it is not fit to be a homage of DDLJ, get a life. Any movie aspiring to be a DDLJ does not have be as good as the former. HSKD is too good to be true for a movie with DDLJ hangover. I am not going to judge this movie on the basis of how closely it pays homage to DDLJ. I will rate the movie on its own merit and it definitely deserves 3- 3.5 out of 5.First of all, full marks to Aalia and Varun for portraying their characters so effortlessly. Some people are complaining about Aalia's character whether any small town girl would behave like Aalia behaves in this movie. Two things, anything in the vicinity of NCR is not a village or small town, period. Plus, she is shown as a darling of the family and spoiled and at the same time vulnerable and I don't think Aalia could have done any better. She is Kareena Kapoor of this generation. Varun plays typical good for nothing middle class Delhi guy and he does equally good. Siddharth Shukla was supposed to look like a hunk when compared to Varun and he did an OK job. Thankfully he didn't really need to perform much, so he somehow balanced his act. Screenplay lacks detailing, I know today girls and guys could be close friends and can even share dirty jokes, but I guess a scene where Aalia watches porn (string operation) with the guys was too much, may be in 2025 but not right now. It reminds me of a scene in Rock-star where Ranbir and Nargis watch a c-grade movie in theater and can't stop giggling. I don't know where our writers get these kind of ideas, they do not happen even in most urban society. Also screenplay is full of clichÃ©s, but good acting saves the day. Direction by Shashank Khaitan is good, one big mistake he did is he and the marketing team promoted this movie as a tribute to DDLJ. If they had promoted this as another regular love story, box office collection and appreciation could have been much much better. Good luck to Varun for acting with his idols in Dilwale, hope that will rock." 
" The Most Ridiculous Plot Of 2014. â™¦ 27%","If you have watched DDLJ, then do not even bother considering this potboiler. It looks like it is ripped-off from DDLJ, but mind you, it is an awful rip-off.The story makes no sense at all, where characters come, make their point and dash off with the speed of light. An engaged girl falls in love with a boy who knows about her engagement. Still cajoles her and purportedly makes her fall in love. The father of the girl then puts up a competition between the boy and her fiancÃ©. I know this sounds uncanny and we last saw it in Heropanti. I have no love for people who base their film on such hackneyed plot.The performances are fine: Bhatt's cuteness may charm you, Dhawan's slapstick is fine but he seems to have jumped out of the nearby Main Tera Hero sets. It was real pleasure to watch Ashutosh Rana again after a long time, but then he too succumbs to the director's sloppy skills.If you try to make sense of the film, then you will involuntarily commit suicide inside the theater. The main problem with the film is that characters appear when the director asks them to. It is easily predictable what the climax would be, so it cannot be termed a spoiler alert if I say that the fiancÃ© is nowhere in picture in the climax. And then there are unbearable songs (what, 5?) stuffed between the rather narrow storyline.The film actually is a money-generating strategy by the producers. Bhatt & Dhawan are youth icons, so the youth may have a look, curious of the songs and the rom-com genre. I wonder why Yo Yo Honey Sing was not roped in for the music; the makers may have earned a crore or two more. It also makes potshots at Punjabi community, homosexuals, NRIs, et cetera.BOTTOM LINE: I might have chuckled few times but that's all. If you skip this film, you will not lose anything. Rather, use your 140 minutes in doing something productive.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" It is a tired, hackneyed story with zero originality!","I just returned home after watching Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhaniya. I decided to watch this film since the theater close to my home had no early morning shows for Dawn of the Planet of the apes. Ah boy wasn't that a mistake from my part? Don't judge me, I'm not one of those who writes crap about Bollywood films, I genuinely like Bollywood films. But when I watch overly-clichÃ©d films like these, I make sure to let other people know about it.It's not a bad movie but it's not good either. Is it worth watchable? Sure, if you have been enjoying watching all the clichÃ©d romantic films Dharma productions has been slapping on us then, why not. But do read my review below.So to start with, let me clear out one thing, which may or may not affect your decision in going for the film, that the plot isn't original. Hell, it's not even 30% original. It is an amalgamation of clichÃ©d romantic films we have been watching in Big screens for last 20- 30 years! The Punjabi family, the big fat wedding, the forced marriage angle, fun-loving out spoken heroine(Alia in and as Kareena Kapoor of Jab We Met), to be bride falls in love with a Desi munda, desi munda going to meet the girl's family to convince for the wedding... I mean, whats up Bollywood? You have been loading us with the same BS story-line for the last two decades, the only difference is the film titles and character backgrounds.The plot is predictable(well, surprise). You will be able to sense the climax from the time you sit for the second-half. This is a complete failure from the part of writing department. The dialogues are way too cheesy.I think director made this film for those who is still in love with the Raj-Simran of DDLJ. This film is said to be a tribute to DDLJ, but it feels more like an unofficial remake with a few plot changes here and there. I wont go deep into that as I think I have said enough about the plot originality in the above para.The only positive thing about the movie is the chemistry of the lead actors, which is superb. They both looked good together as they gelled perfectly on-screen. In a way it feels that their awesome on-screen chemistry went in vain due to such lousy, half-baked script.But wait before loading all the criticism on script writer, save a bit for the *acting performance* of lead actors too. Sure, they both look good together and they both have fair-share of good moments together on- screen too, but both have been poor individually.At least in my eyes Alia has come a long way -- from four months of liking her as a decent actress to considering her as an average actress who got a chance in the industry due to her father's connections. She tries too hard to be like Kareena Kapoor in the film. I would have appreciated her if she even did 50% of what Kareena did in Jab We Met.When you watch Varun Dhawan in this film, you will be forced to think that how this guy got a chance in the industry and why is he trying too hard to be funny. There are quiet a lot of scenes he has overacted. It's not something you can ignore. He should take things a bit easy and choose scripts more carefully.HSKD is a calculated effort to cash in on the stardom of Alia and Varun among the youth audience by Karan Johar.Pluses:Lead-actor's on-screen chemistry Few fun momentsMinuses:Overcooked clichÃ©s Non-existence of a proper script Cheesy dialogues Fat Punjabi dadOverall verdict: It is a tired, hackneyed story with zero originality and zero life. Perhaps with an altered script and better writing team with same cast, this film could have worked." 
" Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania, though predictable and low on logic/ reality parameters; yet enjoy watching it unfold along with very much likable lead pair and other cast.","Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania, Shashank Khaitan's film, is an attempt to relive the magic of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, but definitely in its own way. DDLJ was one of the major blockbusters that Bollywood industry has seen and it gave a new attitude to the youngsters. Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania may not be the DDLJ of this decade, but yes, it is a movie in a true filmi style and it would bring smile to your face for sure. It does not ride high as far as logic is concerned. The movie definitely has some warm and emotional moments. The story is definitely predictable - girl meets the boy, both fall in love in spite of girl's engaged status, and then the pursuit for marriage by taking efforts to get the approval of family. The movie sticks to its core purpose â€“ entertainment in filmy style, romance, comedy Â… This movie is for that segment of audience who just wants to watch movie for sheer entertainment and can't tolerate rona-dhona.Attitudes of the lead protagonists Rakesh 'Humpty' Sharma and Kavya Pratap Singh (Alia Bhatt) are shown initially itself in almost parallel frames, one being a carefree 'cool' Delhi guy, who flirts, always ready with witty one-liners and the later one a feisty Ambala girl. Humpty has friends Shonty (Gaurav Pandey) and Poplu (Sahil Vaid) who are always there for him. Humpty is shown to share great friendly relationship with his father (Kenny Desai). Humpty is a hard-core DDLJ movie fan, who still weeps towards the end of the movie. Kavya wears her attitude through the tattoo 'Pataka' on back side of her neck. According to her - "Main to paida hi hot hui thi". She is part of a rich family who is engaged to a NRI. She negotiates with her father Pratap Singh (Ashutosh Rana) to get her designer Lahanga worth 5 Lakhs. The logic is she did not get a chance to choose the guy, so at least she should get the right to choose her lehanga. Also, her friend Gurpreet of Delhi has bought a Lehanga of 2.5 Lakhs, so she should go for a lehanga of at least double the price. Kavya makes all these scenes very very enjoyable with her innocence. When Pratap Singh sweetly says no to her lehanga demand, she informs the family that she is going to Delhi (her uncle stays there), would earn and buy herself designer Lehanga and return after attending her friend Gurpreet's (Guncha Narula) marriage. Kavya meets Humpty in Delhi in a hilarious situation. Let me not reveal the same. Humpty and Kavya hit off instantly. They do fight, enjoy parties, competes over guzzling beer. Banter between the two is fun, natural, lovable. Both move ahead without any serious ties. They collectively help Gurpreet get out of a messy situation. And then the moment comes, when Kavya has to come back to Ambala. Shashank Khaitan has not redone Raj-Simran here, when Humpty and Kavya bump into bed soon after they feel for each other. Both of them try to move on lives in their respective cities without each other, but unable to do so. Humpty comes to Ambala along with Shonty and Paplu. Yes, a series of physical assault happens once family learns of Humpty's love for Kavya, but the tone of the violence is mellowed down. Humpty manages to get some time from Pratap Singh to prove him that he is the right choice for Kavya, better than the NRI Angad Bedi (Sidharth Shukla). Humpty's challenges increase when Angad does the entry into the scene as Mr. Perfect.How is Angad as a guy? We know that Humpty and Kavya would unite at the end, but how? The treatment to the plot is done in a very light-hearted manner. How does Pratap Singh yield? How does Humpty win Kavya's family's hearts?Cast is just superb. Ashutosh Rana as Kavya's father is very good. What a wonderful actor he is. He pours his intensity as well as sense of humour into the character. Varun Dhawan has done complete justice to his character. Alia is also wonderful. Her face has the right combination of innocence, chirpiness, traditional, bindass attitude. She makes Kavya so much lovable. Sidharth as Angad Bedi has great screen presence. I just wish, Sidharth's role could have been a bit longer and his vanishing from the last frames could have been given different treatment. Both Sahil Vaid and Gaurav Pandey as Humpty's friends and Kenny Desai as Humpty's father are all adorable, excellent performances from them. Rest of the cast are also good. Music could have been better. The song 'Samjhawan' composed by Toshi- Sharib and sung by Shreya-Arijit is very good." 
" The greatest tribute to Nonsense and Stupidity!!","I wish there was rating in negative. I imagine how this movie was written. The most pathetic script, even worse direction blended with awful over acting. the scenes get so stupid you almost want to hit the characters. Goodness gracious!!! Censor board should visit these kind of movies and ban them for public consumption. These are injurious to a normal brain!! Trying to copy DDLJ and they fail miserably. This is the greatest tribute to foolishness!! Don't waste your money guys. Spend it on food, give it to beggars, do something else...I wish!! sincerely wish the director and the writer get this head out of their bums to not produce this kind of disaster again!!" 
" Movie for Zombies- not humans!","I just created an account now in IMDb just to write a review about this crap that I watched few hours ago. I cannot believe people are rating up to 3 stars out of 5 and 6.1 rating!!! I just wish there was zero or negative in the vote!If you are a big DDLJ-SRK fan please stay away! I think these people have lost their mind and they think people who watch movies are stupid and mean enough to like an awful story like this. Have this director ever watched DDLJ??? I personally feel that this is perfectly crafted to mock and insult the lovely performance of SRK and Kajol in DDLJ!!! Boy I wish they would never watch this pathetic movie. I have no idea why Karan Johar would agree upon something like this. The way modern Indian culture depicted in this movie is so condemnable. Please don't watch this movie guys or you will want to slap the director and the actors for choosing this script. 'Normal Human beings' will definitely hate this movie. May be they should try showing this movie to Zombies so that they could eat these peoples brains and just kill them right away!" 
" A nice watch with comedy, drama, romance and emotions!","We have seen many Bollywood movies which provides masala, melodrama, humor and typical romance! This formula is now repetitive in every movie nowadays. But it is more important to note that the filmmaker provides the right content at right time and it's not an easy job! Shashank Khaitan and Karan Johar's latest offering "HUMPTY SHARMA KI DULHANIA" does it right and their effort is admirable! So here we go:Story: Like every other Bollywood rom-com, the story of the film has the same formula: Boy meets Girl, Girl meets Boy, Love Blossoms, Circumstances bring them apart, They reunite but it is a long journey and they have to go and must win the approval of the family (especially bride's one)! And it provides all the elements like humor, comedy, drama, romance etc. at the right moments and at the right time which most of the films fail to do so!Cast: Varun Dhawan: He has completely evolved as an actor and he has won the status of a performer this time!! He pulls off the comic and emotional situations efficiently which is no cakewalk!! He has a long way to go!! You can't take your eyes off from him!Alia Bhatt: If 2013 was Deepika Padukone's year as she gave four back-to back hits (Race 2, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Chennai Express and Goliyon Ki Raasleela: Ram-Leela), then 2014 is Alia Bhatt's year for sure!! Her choice of diverse roles is surely bringing her status higher and higher! After Highway (2014), and 2 States (2014), she gives a superb performance in this one too!!! Siddharth Shukla: He plays his character with efficiency! Acting on Television and in a Movie is two different situations and he truly justifies his character!!Ashutosh Rana: He is adequate as Alia's Father. His sequences with Varun is truly striking!!I'd also like to mention those two actors who played Varun's friends, are brilliant!! Along with Varun, they are sure to bring smiles and laughs on your face!Diresction: Debutant Director Shashank Khaitan has made a wonderful effort by bringing a rom-com with delights and with flourish!! The screenplay is truly intriguing and is in sync with the mood of the film! As for Karan Johar, I can watch any of his film blindly as when he provides any film, it is always refreshing and engaging!!!Music: The music is just decent in this film with the exception of two songs that are simply outstanding: "Samjhavan" is absorbing and soulful and "Saturday Saturday" is foot-tapping and is the pick of the lot!! Overall Verdict: On the whole, HUMPTY SHARMA KI DULHANIA is a nice watch with electrifying chemistry between the lead actors, amazing comic situations and drama and emotions being captured beautifully. It would be loved by the Gen Next (Young Generation) as well as the kids and classy people!!Rating:***1/2" 
" worst and time wasting ever in romantic type movie","I can say this is predicted incident movie, because of it's speeches and incidents. When watching, all is happened like I know earlier it's gonna happen next. How worst and ridiculous funny romantic movie story and script it is. Hero isn't worthy to get heroin but knot with her at last showing some emotions and extra facility from heroin's family members which is fully hilarious. This is more funny when heroin's father himself intend to give his daughter for smoking with hero and influenced by his wife and mother! Al the last I think movie might be turned back when heroin's brother in law returned to her sister life which will possible for hero's efforts, loll but I was wrong :P . Besides hero's two friend talking about BD-Keyea cricket match that no one watch it, by the way director and script writer should know there are vast population in BD and Keyea who are main spectacular of their match. No need to watch any Indians to watch it. There is no right for any loser director to use another country and their cricket match for funny show. This movie is also show how we young generation specially woman create physical relation before marriage and after extramarital relation. ( Vanu and Accounts sir wife) So this is time wasting and fully fraud show for young generation and all, besides it's a shame for Dharma Production." 
" Well, why r KJo movies becoming so predictable nowadays?","Firstly, I am a very big fan of Varun Dhawan, secondly I am a fan of KJo, thirdly I do not dislike Aalia Bhatt, however I have to say I have been disappointed and I was wondering if I could file a police complaint against Dharma Productions (for ticket plus popcorn and 3 hours time loss) for falsely propagating 'just another movie' as a 'special one'. Well to speak of the movie, just all the fans are gonna love it. Its just a typical masala KJo movie. Stars, fancy dresses, fancier locations and a not so fancy script (remember ek main aur ek tu? this is an example. gladly the two movies have no resemblance). There's nothing to complain about anything wrong being done in the movie, but its just so predictable and mainstream that all the lovely sets and lovely actors don't make up for the loss/waste of time in the end. All said and done, watch it as there is no major release till Eid BUT at your own risk. I am off to the nearest police station....." 
" Just Short of Being a Brilliant Comic Love Story","HUMPTY SHARMA KI DULAHNIYA - One of my know person have said to he that i should not compare this movie to DDLJ after watching....So i m not comparing,,,, Personally i m not a very big fan of DDLJ ,,rather Dil To Pagal Hei is one if my all time favorite from that era of Bollywood which i liked more then DDLJ....And i know most of the people will disagree with me,,,,that doesn't matter..... So HSKD is not a copy of DDLJ but has been made as a tribute to DDLJ with a very light humor , not to be taken seriously...... And i m very happy to say that i got a really enjoyable movie as i haven't expected that much.....The credit goes to the cast , the screenplay and the dialogs(for most)....From the very first moment of the movie you are gonna laugh to the very end scene of the movie..... See when a movie is made with such light humor there are some flaws or u can say illogical things in the movie,,,,the maker wants us to take some things for granted....We cant find reason for everything what is happening on the screen.....Like how Alia's father's mind changed in the end for Varun.....It should have been shown although then it could have been perfect....And what happened to Shidhart Shukla ,, he just disappeared without saying a single worlds.....Also the climax scene was not so exiting......But the movie was..... Varun as Humpty is cute and sweet helping everyone ,, there is nothing quite bad about him,,,,you will like him anyway,,,,,.....Varun Dhawan has lived role,,,,,he is gonna be a revolution in Bollywood as a comic hero,,,,there will be a trend coming soon of Varun Dhawan as once have been of Govinda,,,,the dialog delivery , the expression dance everything is just perfect.....Watch out for the scene where He is crying after getting message from Alia - ''GOT MARRIED''.....Its done brilliantly..... Alia is confidante as she was in 2 states ,, and she looks beautiful as always.....But i sometimes feels that she acts more matured as compared to she is actually..... Shiddhart Shukla get less time to act ,, but has his own charm and great physic..... One thing i specially liked about the movie is that the person against the hero is not dumb or immature like we use to watch in DDLJ or Jab We Met,,,,rather he is quite a perfect guy,,,,without any wrong thing in him.....It becomes difficult for our hero to prove that why he is good for Alia as compared to Angad(Shidharth Shukla)..... Ashutosh Rana disappoints to me ,, specially because he is not following the Punjabi accent of saying Hindi,,,,it decreases the effect.....Special or i can say very special mention for two friends of Varun - Shonty and Poplu and specially Poplu who will make u laugh again and again and again,,some times more then Varun..... Dialogues and direction by Shashank Khaitan are really helpful for making the movie great....Director has chosen the easy route to direct the movie by which audience could be easily connected to the movie..... This a movie to watch ,, just go and laugh...... M going for 8 out 10 which is really high rating for a comic love story...... By ANuP APu KuMaR ....."
