" Must watch","Truly Aashiqui 2.The film is targeted at the youth.It will leave your eyes wet and your throats dry.Amazing chemistry and performance.Must watch.8/10Mohit Suri tunes the first half slowly, allowing the romance to simmer in torment and triumph. Aarohi's character is endearing, but displays innate strength. Rahul stays pretty much 'bottled' (like 'Devdas' with a cause), with sudden outbursts of frustration and fury.Story is a 'fix' for die-hard lovers.AASHIQUI 2 brings romance back on the Hindi screen -- intense, pure, selfless and heart wrenching. A stirring account with brilliant moments, bravura performances, strong emotional quotient and addictive music, this one's an absolute must watch for the romantics. On the whole, Aashiqui 2 is an entertaining film with hit music and the sacrificing nature of the heroine as it biggest trump cards. It will keep its distributors smiling." 
" A truly amazing love story..!!","Aashiqui 2,a truly amazing love story. It was a pleasure watching such a beautifully directed movie with a great and different story. Fantastic work by the not so experienced new faces Shraddha kapoor and Aditya Roy kapoor which made a very beautiful couple on stage. It wasn't the usual same old love story script but very well written and executed script. The emotions and truly incredible songs put up at appropriate moments were the charm! Shraddha kapoor's roles in her previous films like "luv ka the end" , "teen Patti" were not as effective and couldn't bring her into the limelight. But this movie is surely going to be a great comeback for her in the Bollywood film industry.Same goes with Aditya Roy kapoor.A very effective n deeply heart touching love story which is a must watch if you like love story movies..!!" 
" Best Romantic Movie Of This Decade.",""Aashiqui 2" is just an Amazing Movie.. I can't really say anything about it, I'm really speechless..Aditya Roy is such a talented actor and such a nice guy.. I couldn't felt even for a moment that he's acting, It was seems like he's really living those moment and his love for Arohi was true..And the Music of this Movie.. I better not say anything because all you know these songs are.... truly Incredibly Awesome. I hope the songs of this movie will last forever... and People will love the songs more than they loved "Aashiqui 1's" songs.. and Arijit Singh was such a talented singer and we couldn't have realized it before, He'll become another Kumar Sanu soon.Well, The true value of this movie will only understand those people, Who are in Love. I hope it beats all the old box office record..Long Live Aashiqui 2 :D"

" Aashiqui 2 (WOW!!..)","Its been a years that i haven't seen a romantic flick which has not got SRK or which is not a Yash Raj banner's movie..Aashiqui 2 is a complete surprise which has beautiful songs that connects to the hearts. Aditya & Shraddha both are incredible in the movie.This movie has tried to show how an alcoholic tries to fight to quit the habit & how his love goes beyond her ways to tender him & protect him..I was little disappointed with the ending. However, this movie could have had multiple ending so considering that it wasn't that bad..It's a must watch kind of romantic movie if you have a taste for it.." 
" Lovely, Rahul Roy would be proud !","This one is out of this world. The benchmark for the last part of the 20th century was set by Aashiqui 1 and this one has set a new benchmark for 21st century.Amazing performances from the two lead actors to say the least. Once you listen to the music especially TUM HI HO, it is hard to take it out of your mind. You will only understand this movie if you were in Love and lost your love due to certain circumstances surrounding you. This movie will surely touch many many people if not everyone. Well done guys, it will surely take a lot to beat this movie and come out trumps.Thanks each and everyone involved in Making this Blockbuster !" 
" best love story ever made","Awesome movie. Great Songs. Divine music. Beautiful story telling.You will fall in love with this movie.Despite being newcomers the actors have done a very good job.Forget the critics - they get paid to criticize. There problem is that they know how to do it but can't do it themselves.The movie touches you like no other love story ever has.The best Love Story ever made.Will cherish watching this movie for the rest of my life.What an experience,what a movie.Go fall in love." 
" An excellent movie ...... Sraddha n Aditya were awesome","I usually don't bother writing reviews or anything but this movie made me register on IMDb just to write here.... This movie is awesome.... In fact awesome is a small word... Both Aditya and Shraddha carried their roles brilliantly. You can see that one wants the other's success and one wants only the other in their eyes.... Strong acting, Legendary music, and fantabulous script.... What more can you ask from a movie..... Sun raha hai tu and Tum hi ho will remain in my heart for ever.... I seriously advice people who have loved someone ever in their life to see this movie.... And those who have not fallen in love yet should definitely watch this one....10/10...." 
" Brilliant acting by two fresh faces with great songs!!!","Aashiqui 2 starts of beautifully with a captivating song that you will find yourself humming as you walk out of the theater.Many things hold the movie strong.This was the first time I saw the lead pair Aditya Roy Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor and i was mighty impressed. Aditya with his semi-dashing,semi-conservative looks does a great job portraying a conflicted singer who is past his prime and turned an addicted alcoholic. Shraddha who plays a budding singer whom Aditya promotes exhibits great talent playing a charming and loving girl.The lead pair move the strings in your heart with their powerful performances.The audio of the movie is superlative,the background score is good and two- three songs stand apart.The songs and great acting are the highlights of the movie.On the flip side the second half kinda drags with belabored scenes along with a few scenes that lack common sense.The movie should probably have been half an hour shorter.The ending is unconventional as well.Still the movie has enough stirring moments and is decent enough to watch in the theater!" 
" If only you can enjoy the same rotten story in an again inspired film presented with some good songs.","As an essential clarification, I would like to begin with the fact that if a film is remade or its sequel is planned after decades, then there are simply no grounds on which either the films or their music can be compared in any form or manner whatsoever. And the gigantic reason for this valid argument is that those two projects are purely related to two different times, distinctive eras and two diversely brought-up generations which don't allow us to discuss any kind of comparative study related to the projects unnecessarily. Therefore the review here has nothing to talk about the original AASHIQUI released in 1990 or its extremely popular music in the paragraphs ahead.However, the other harsh reality here remains that with AASHIQUI 2, the Bhatt camp once again proves the wide spread notion in the industry that they truly know the film business more than anybody else in the present, when it comes to making remakes, sequels and inspired movies with some hit tracks unarguably. The film has a title fetching them an instant recognition due to its brand value, an already successful soundtrack, an interesting fresh lead pair and the whole 'Cost-Factor' under control like a perfectly planned business venture which has no probability of giving them losses even if the film is not liked by majority of the audience sitting in the theater. Also following their own decades old track record, this time they pick up the 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN, directed by Frank Pierson and featuring Barbara Streisand & Kris Kristofferson in the lead. Interestingly, the English film has its own history of remaking in both the West and the East beginning from the year 1937. After its initial release in 1937, it got remade twice in 1954 & 1976 (in the west) because of its engaging subject on music & its illustrious career struggles. In India, Hrishikesh Mukherjee made his own cult classic ABHIMAAN in 1973 featuring Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri (Bachchan) in the lead, which was a subtle Indianised version of a similar tale. But it's the current 2013 remake of the Hit, which religiously takes its inspiration from the 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN, revolving around the life of a immensely famous Rock Star fading away from the charts due to his drinking habits & arrogant nature.No doubt, director Mohit Suri and his writer Shagufta Rafique add their own notable insertions in the script to make it an intense emotional love saga, as always expected from the Bhatts. But in the process they push their film into an avoidable zone which is too melodramatic, extremely slow and not so happening for the young audience in particular, after its first hour. In straight words, the film begins well with all its introductory scenes and manages to hold the attention of its viewers in a decent manner. But just before and after the intermission, it loses all its pace, becomes completely predictable and offers nothing in the name of entertainment (read emotional pleasure), despite of having some good tracks playing in the background.At times it does make you feel the 'Mahesh Bhatt Impact' in few of its lovable scenes, but along with that the film also has few directly lifted sequences from the original as usual. It begins with an exactly similar scene taken from the 1976 remake of A STAR IS BORN, the couple meet each other in a bar in almost the same settings and then the film ends too on an identical note, truly following its inspirational source from the West, unsurprisingly.The film's Soundtrack is already a Big Hit, its Cinematography is fine and the Background Score provides what was required from it in a decent manner. But somehow I felt the arrangement (orchestrisation) of its songs too heavy and repeatedly interfering with the otherwise melodious compositions of the tracks & their meaningful lyrics. In the acting department, the fresh pair is likable and they have also acted well in their difficult roles respectively. Yet the appreciation would more go towards Aditya Roy Kapur than Shraddha unfortunately. The boy impresses you right away from his first scene itself and then seems to be at a comfortable ease with his confused character throughout the film. Shraddha looks cute and does well particularly in the second hour. She is sure going to win some hearts with her innocent feature, but still I couldn't feel the emotional attachment with the two characters suffering together on the screen and couldn't relate to them honestly as I wished too.Probably one of the reasons for this detachment from the film was its story-base which in the current scenario is simply bizarre and unimaginable. Because today there is no place as such for Pop Singers or their Individual Pop Albums in Indian Music Market anymore. Yes, this was the scene in the 90s when Pop Culture was flourishing in India due to the Cable TV revolution in the country. But in this new millennium, only film music rules the nation and there is almost no scope of any Pop Artist to make such a name & fame in only few weeks as shown in the film.In a nutshell, it has got performances and some good music too but how many times we are supposed to see the same rotten story again & again like dumb viewers. Its fine that in our part of the world if you have a Hit soundtrack then half of your box office battle is already won. But what about the entertainment factor or the emotional connect in a movie for which the viewers are there sitting in the theater. And in case that is missing in an intense love story such as AASHIQUI 2, it really doesn't deserve any high ratings as far as this review is concerned." 
" Meri Aashiqui Bus Ab Tum Hi Ho!","While people will surely draw similarities between Aashiqui-2 and Abhimaan as the theme may be similar but the treatment is contrast. Here, the story revolves around how obsession pulls you down and importantly there are no ego clashes but a lot of love for each other that eventually gives strength to both for taking their final decisions.In comparison to its contemporary Aashiqui, this one wins the race in all but the music department. I guess Aashiqui-1's music can't be challenged till date and it will remain a milestone forever. Having said that, music of Aashiqui-2 is no less than brilliant, I was humming the songs when I came out despite hearing them very first time so surely they are intoxicating.Story as many would be telling is similar to Abhimaan, a super star musician RJ is rapidly declining from his stardom but he doesn't care of it much. Amidst of this fall to disgrace, he comes across Arohi, a subtle middle class "Dream to catch Moon" girl. He is blown away with her vocals and gives her a dream of making big in music. He in the entire journey to her stardom stands next to her protecting and promoting her being immensely in love with her not caring his personal status. As they say, fame comes with fate. In this case Arohi's rise to top brings happiness to the couple but society brands RJ as a fallen tree who is taking solace in the rise of Arohi. Arohi on the other hand holds together RJ not to fall completely apart, sadly unsuccessfully. The stigma of being the one who is pulling Arohi down from her rise, RJ part his way from her leaving her to become what he always dreamt for her.From the cast point of view, both protagonists fit their roles to the best. Shraddha Kapoor as a middle class girl looks every bit of it, she looks ravishingly refreshing, not with lot of makeup her natural beauty does the charm all the way. Acting wise, I thought she could have done a better job but she was convincing in her role. My pick of the movie is definitely Aditya Kapoor. He has done few roles before this movie but nothing special to mention, this movie would make him a star he should be. His role of a drinking problem ridden vocalist has been revelation. The only thing which I thought was missing was a die for chemistry between both the leads. Mohit Suri needs pat on back for handling the story so well; this movie is surely director's baby. Final acknowledgement to the singers of this movie, Aashiqui-1 made T-Series what it is today, similarly these new singers have made their mark by giving vocals in Aashiqui-2, I hope they will succeed the same way.8/10 for the good show." 
" A Good Film Altogether","After about two years after Rockstar I experienced almost the same effect with Aashiqui 2. It is much more dramatic like any conventional Hindi film. Heavy dialogues which will sometimes get you thinking. The script and story actually doesn't matter much when it gets the job done for the audience. The film has its own moments. Sometimes they will look a bit lame to you but ultimately the viewer will fall in love with them. I usually get a bit bored while watching Hindi films and this one kept me hooked, was more of an accomplishment.The story is a bit well paced in the first half and keeps it grips the viewers with many different shots and then comes the second half in which the struggle with alcohol abuse is mainly focused and is shown excellently. Mohit Suri didn't wander into ridiculous depths to show the alcohol abuse but kept it strong, unlike Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas. It wasn't required here because the movie didn't require it. The second half was jeweled with symbolic sequences and again gets the viewers thinking about alcohol abuse and its consequences.The sound, the music was awesome and that's where I think I am comparing this film with Rockstar. The music of Aashiqui 2 knitted up the scenes spectacularly and made you high and low with it and in the end even got a lump in your throat and a teardrop in your eye.I won't say that acting was the forte' of this film but the actors did a commendable job. Shraddha Kapoor's inncocent but pure dialogues and acting will keep you hooked.Despite of all the minor flaws. You will fall in love with this film without a doubt and that is what counts.I will give this film a 3.5 on 5 for a good package all together. Cheers." 
" A horrid tale","I would not call it a movie. It was an ensemble of people who were groping for a meaningful story, screenplay, direction and choreography. Sometimes in life everything go bad; Asshiqui 2 is that bad! It is an old plot of a rich prodigal guy loving a poor prodigal girl. They strike a bond immediately and viewer never understand the why and how of that! There are so many loopholes, plain faces of lead actors, even side actors did bad (other than a watchman, he was good). Dialogue delivery of actors unpolished, plot unplanned, and haphazard. There was no congruity between actions and emotions. Direction was lost at its best. Movie did not even care to explain many vital questions like what was wrong with RJ, how Aarohi became so successful? Who was RJ's dad? Why RJ became a moron? Why didn't RJ and Aarohi marry? And ultimately, why did RJ commit suicide?There is an endless list that I prepared while watching through a typical substandard family sop like movie. It was a time to kill in the cinema hall.Music was the only good thing. And I got enough of it.Avoid this movie." 
" nothing to see","while i set down to write a review for this film, i thought what is really good things that this film have....? littreally nothing. from starting to end everything goes flat. Aditya Roy kapoor need acting class. even after 4 film he does not know acting. even very easy emotion that he didn't carry out. he play the character that drunk all the time, but his dalogue tone & speech is as as other person even director has not noticed. few question i really like to ask to Mohit Suri which he didn't explain in film...! 1- why Rahul was drinking alcohol all the time in film...? 2- why he want to make a SHradha as a singer...! 3- he really love Shradha or he hate her fame or he frustrated for nothing..? 4- why he was breaking glass, tabel and other stuff in house all the time?...? if u really want to see the grate performance than watch 'awargi'... Anil kapoor was his best. even Satish Kaushik & Govinda as a supporting cast were nice. overall Aashiqui 2 is mixture of Film Daddy, Awargi, Abhiman...." 
" horribly slow movie.. misleading for youth","Very misleading for today's youth. Love can conquer everything. Love gives you hope and faith to live life not to lose your life. Very slow and dragging movie. The only good point about movie is song and music. Acting is also good. But the message story conveys it's not appealing. It's not a movie one can remember forever like KAL HO NA HO or DDLJ. the story of success and failure of stardom is very old. Giving up life for your loved one is not really a solution. Must avoid.. don't waste your time. Movie could have been really fast paced. movie is not that effective to put a good sign. Aditya Roy Kapoor is quite promising with his superb acting. very less was from Arohi." 
" Highly Depressive Movie","Movie Review: Aashiqui 2This movie is about untreated depression, which ends up in a suicide. The Urdu word "Aashiqui" means "Showing love for someone". If that was the case, then the whole movie was quite ironic cause there was no love shown, rather hatred for self and for someone you claim to love by following it through a coward act of suicide. Leaving your loved ones at the mercy of a world without you, by choice. It took me 5 years to finally bring myself to watch a movie that has been so successful at box office and popular, especially among the youth. When something is this popular, I usually don't watch it right away as I seem to give it some time to gather enough reviews. Its like reading a product's reviews before actually being the "first victim" of any such product.Watching this movie was quite depressing and many times, I just wanted to turn it off right in the middle. But each time, an awesome music will stop me. It has great songs, playback singers and simply amazing musical production. IMHO, probably the only reason this movie became so popular i.e. its music and songs. Beyond that, a complete failure at everything. I do want to give credit to the acting but something inside me stops from doing that only out of my frustration at the movie scriptwriters. Probably a classic example of how a good music and a good acting can save a potentially terrible movie plot. I strongly recommend you to NOT watch it as I will NEVER watch it again."
