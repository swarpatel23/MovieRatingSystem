" Surprisingly Good","I went to watch this film in advance, and i have to honestly say that this film was surprisingly good. I have to admit that after interval where the secret is revealed, it was predictable, but which film isn't. This film has it all, laughter, emotion, glamour. But akshay kumar and bobby deol i have to say played their parts really well. As for the two girls, they are just eye-candy for the whole film. I recommend to watch this film. It is also quite a short film compared to other suneel darshan films and other films at the box off this Christmas, the only other thing i have to mention are the songs, which are terrific, some better than others, but overall they are good." 
" This is what Bollywood is all about.","No shoddy remake of a Hollywood film. No re-hash of countless other buddy-buddy movies seen in Bollywood. No violence and no scenes that a family watching together would have to squirm at.Great songs, superb performances and a good solid Indian story. Suneel Darshan has again created a film that you can watch again and again. Bobby puts in one of his finest performances, Akshay is reliable as usual, Kareen and Lara give good performances for the time they have on screen. And its great to see Juhi in a role where she is not the older sister.Two wonderful twists, great comedy, wonderful drama, an emotional roller-coaster of a film that shows what Indian cinema is good at.Forget the Hollywood remakes, this is the type of film we love to see Bollywood producing." 
" Very Good Movie","Never trust Box Office Rankings, cause this movie was not a Hit in India at all, and the critics was not so fund of it. And I actually got influenced by it, until I one day was getting so bored that I actually saw Dosti.And Iam happy that I saw it, its actually a very good movie, and Akshay Kumar and Bobby Deol did a excellent job. The story have been seen many times before, but cause of the actors it seemed to touch the viewer the right place.If you want to see a god movie with excellent acting and very good songs, you have to see this movie, it will not let you down unless you are a Action type freak then this movie is nothing for you.Enjoy this movie Friends." 
" two friends who have such a strong bond...must see","This is one hell of a movie....emotion....love....sadness....and lat of all but not least friendship. The story revolves around the friendship of 2 men Raj 'Akshay Kumar' and Karan 'Bobby Deol'. Even in the difference of their social status Karan a rich guy who lacked love and belonging in his life but never missed anything materialistic and Akshay who was poor and had to work hard for a living they still remained the best of friends. They were inseparable...if one cried the other made him laugh....the more unequal they were, social status etc the more closer the got and society simply envied this.However all good things always seem to come to an abrupt end eventually. Will both be affected by the society that they lived in that envied their friendship. THEY never thought so but life does have some unexpected turns and you'll have to watch the movie to find out what happens...." 
" Akshay prove that he is still the best.","i watched this movie on Thursday. this movie was so good and emotional. Akshay as usual(Waqt,Garam Masala, Deewane Huye Paagal, Andaaz,Khakee and MSK) did his best performance but it sad how he died at the end. As for Bobby he is improving, Lara Dutta was looking hot,same with Kareena. the movie is about: Karan (Bobby Deol) was wealthy and a mansion was his habitat. Raj (Akshay Kumar), an orphan, had empty pockets and the sky was his roof.Karan's jet ensured that he could fly if he wanted. Raj could only depend on his two feet. Karan had a family (Kiran Kumar, Lilette Dubey) and yet craved for love. Raj had love to share, but craved for a family.Karan was the eternal Casanova. Raj was the proverbial one-woman man. Karan had it all, and yet felt empty. Raj had nothing, but his heart was full.They were two people as different as can be. Yet they found a common ground. One that led to the glorious road of friendship. Their bond was unshakable.If Karan gave Raj a home and all the material comforts, Raj gave Karan a shoulder and all the emotional security. If Karan supported Raj at every step, Raj covered up for all of Karan's misdoings. They laughed together, lied together, loved together and fought the odds together all in the name of friendship.10/10" 
" wonderful movie","As you can see the title of this movie is Dosti, so of course its about two best friends who can die for each other. And I really love this wonderful film.Its a beautiful Indian movie and I had never seen anything like this before in ma life and in Bollywood's history. So I strongly recommend you guys to watch it. There are too many emotions and a lots of comedy in this film. After all its staring Bobby Deol & Aksay Kumar. The story is little similar to KHNH but in this movie you can enjoy a lot. Plus, this one is much better than Kal Ho Na Ho. Because it contains friendship, love, comedy, songs and a sentimental touch that will surely make you cry in the end." 
" Nice heartwarming movie about friendship","'Dosti: Friends Forever' was a pleasant surprise to me. The performances were very strong and I loved the dynamics between the 2 lead characters, Raj (played by Akshay Kumar) and Karan (played by Bobby Deol). The portrayal of intimate friendship was very heartfelt and honest, and it was moving to watch. To me, the way these 2 actors portrayed this bond is the core of the film, and it carries the film.This is a movie about choices, about identity, about how a friend can change your life and make you a better person, about relationships, about unselfish love, about life. This film tackles some very important issues in a real and honest way. It will make you think and will touch your heart.The two lead actors were very generous with each other, especially Bobby Deol, and this must be applauded. It was not competitive with the actors constantly trying to upstage each other. This reminded me of the dynamics between Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan in 'Sholay'. In a way, some parts of 'Dosti' are a mini-homage to 'Sholay', which was a nice idea. There's a part where they're both on motorbikes singing a song with the words 'Yeh Dosti' in it. The homage is discreet and not an obvious 'copycat' attempt, which is nice and wise because although Bobby Deol is Dharmendra's son and Akshay has played Bachchan's son in movies like 'Waqt' and 'Ek Rishtaa', these 2 actors, although very good, have not attained the status of the older actors, who are now icons.Akshay Kumar surprised me in this movie with a beautifully nuanced performance. He did incredibly well, as did Bobby Deol. The 2 of them deserve kudos for great work in this film. 2 stand-out scenes are where Bobby is railing at God; and when Akshay begs Juhi for a chance to attend his friend's wedding. At the climactic dance scene in the movie, Akshay seems to do a bit too much, but in retrospect, that's probably what was right for his character and the intensity of his position. Lovely acting, I was really impressed.The rest of the cast is also very good, especially the 2 actors who play Bobby Deol's mother and father. The scene where Karan's father apologises is very touching. Very nice work by the 2 of them.A couple of flaws: the 2 female leads, while adequate, did not work hard enough to portray the turmoil of their characters. Their performances ended up seeming a bit shallow. Kareena Kapoor was slightly better than the other lead actress (who seemed more concerned with dancing in skimpy outfits), but even Kareena lost steam by the end and failed at the crucial moment to truly depict her character's turmoil on screen. Akshay gave her chance but she didn't rise to meet it. In my opinion, both actresses could learn something from Juhi Chawla. In a small role as Aditi in this film, she leaves a solid emotional impact. Nice work by Juhi.Another glaring flaw is that the beginning of the movie, with the 2 friends as kids (nice acting by the young ones, I must say) appears to take place in the present time. There is no 'aging' of the costumes and decor, and the 2 boys are even playing contemporary video games. 20 years later, nothing has changed. However, this and several other inconsistencies I might name are commonplace in Bollywood (with a few exceptions like 'Parineeta'), so they really don't affect one's enjoyment of the movie.The music in the film is excellent, the direction is also very good and I really enjoyed the flashback technique employed by the director and the screenwriter. The 'flow' of the movie was beautiful, and it was very well paced and kept to a nice length.There are parallels between 'Dosti' and films like 'Kal Ho Naa Ho' and 'Waqt'. I think Dosti is just as good, in fact better than either of these movies, and that's saying a lot, because 'Waqt', for example, was very good indeed.To sum up, this really is a nice piece of work, the actors have done well and the film will definitely touch your heart if you let it. It actually made me cry!" 
" Excellent","WHAT A BLAST????????????????????????????????????? I saw this movie with my cousin on EID day and when i watched the movie i said i want 2 become a actor but this movie made my cousin cry 3 times & i cried 2 times. I tell everyone something that Akshay Kumar did the best performance in DOSTI & Bobby Deol. Kareena Kapoor was looking good in Dosti & Lara Dutta. I like when Lara tells Bobby go get 4 me & my friend an ice-cream he go's 2 times they get melted then he says the 3rd time i got to do it because he LOVES HERR. The songs are smash it Dulhania. Let's Boogie & Aisa Kai Zindagi. And the sad songs are Title song, Mera Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai when Akshay Kumar gets few attacks in the song & specially ISHQ NA ISHQ HO KISSEH. Juhi Chawla her performance are good she did brilliant acting . what i didn't like that Bobby's parents in the movie didn't like Akshay Kumar that was SO sad because Akshay Kumar was poor & Bobby rich. The ending bit of the movie is the saddest part that made me so much tears come out of my eyes. In Engeland is so hard 2 find a best friends like Bobby & Akshay.MY Opinion RATING 10/10" 
" Lara and bobby","Before i watched this film i thought it was going to be cheesy because thats what bobby and khilladi are good at but i was wrong.I loved this a lot that I'm thinking of buying it and i don't do that often.It had everything i enjoy about bollywood the beginning when khilladi is an police officer that is so funny.I loved the chemistry between bobby deol and Lara dutta they always seem to work so well.The best songs for me have to be duniya and ishq Na ishq ho.I didn't like kareenas attitude when she finds out about raj. The film was a nice heart warming film.I hope to see these guys do other projects together" 
" A touching film","This is the first and only movie to make me cry. It was that good. This movie is really deep and will get you. The intensity at the end of the movie was so suspenseful especially at the end. This movie really got me started in watching Bollywood films. The beginning was very comical and the ending was very dramatic. It's very hard to find this in a Hollywood Film because it is usually is based upon one genre. 10/10 I have to have ten lines.This is the first and only movie to make me cry. It was that good.

" two words awful and boring","I can't see how any can stand this movie. I wasted my money renting this movie out. It is horribly predictable from the very first scene. Both actors bobby and akshay look like complete clowns (they should just stick with action/comedy roles). Not to mention the copy of Pear Harbour scenes between their friendship when they were young. I mean come on to show simple things as that no directer or story writer needs to Xerox Hollywood movies. And where did Larra Dutta character come from. she just disappears and then drops in from no where I mean it just keeps dropping from no where awful and unprofessional!!!!!There is only one thing good about this movie is the "DHULHANYA SONG". overall please don't waste your time or money watching this movie" 
" Just another movie","This is just another movie with a silly story, some songs & some tears. I don't want to waste my time in writing what's bad about the movie. I'll focus on the good things. Lara Dutta's performance is very good. She has such amazing screen presence. A couple of songs are really good. Kareena Kapoor is good in what she does & her acting skills are good as well. Bobby Deol is jinxed. He got the looks, the skills & the money. Unfortunately, all his movies are box office bombs. This is another multi-starer to hit cinemas. But we're really bored watching stories of friends turning into lovers, lovers turning into friends, friends being enemies, enemies being friends & so on. You can watch this movie if you're really bored. And I mean REALLY BORED!" 
" good movie","Hello my name is aaronbir singh osahan and I am loving this film and film it was so good great story-line about friendship it reminds me having great moments with my buddies best songs ever made akshay and Bobby were brilliant as always it was amazing to see Kareena akshay and Bobby after ajnabee The other cast was superb in their performances nice direction nice screenplay My rating overall is 7/10 but it was kind of emotional when akshay kumar's character dies overall it is worth watching and deserves more acclaim i already watched this movie this week in october 2018" 
" Words cannot describe how bad this movie is","This movie is the one of the worst movie in a long time. Every thing about this movie is bad. Not even Akshay Kumar can save this movie. The acting is shoddy, the music is lack lustre, the chemistry between actors and actresses and even the two actors is non-existent. There is only one fleeting moment of relief in the opening sequence when the boys age that is bearable and indeed humorous. Other than that i don't have enough sentences to describe the quality of this movie. The child actors especially the one playing Akshay is pathetic, in the beginning you feel the movie is about 2 Gays and not just friends. PLEASE PLEASE take my advice Don't EVEN GO NEXT TO THE THEATER THAT SHOWS THIS MOVIE!!!" 
" A Pure Emotional Romance...!!!","Bobby Deol & Akshay Kumar as main lead was really fantastic. An Extreme Pleasure rolled throughout the film completely. Suneel Darshan coming through action thrillers to Romantic Drama proved a success one. Akshay Kumar Fitted the role well so Bobby Deol. Both Females Suppoting were good in the skin except Kareena loses somewhere in the film. It has good music & an emotional touching lyrics. Two Best Hits Songs were "Dulhania" & "Aur Tum Aaye". The Climax was too short & Akshay's Death was seen through Bobby's Son also Named "Raj". Dosti:-Friends Forever is a purely romantic emotional script thus showing how to maintain good friendship like Raj & Karan..!!! Wasiim rate it 5.8/10 citing the above statement & Its a Really Beautiful Film." 
" Another friendship crap","Every since the birth of Indian film industry, in any film made on Dosti (friendship), there is always a rich friend and a poor friend. Rich friend has everything but love. Poor friend has nothing but love. One of the friends always has to die. Common guys, its time to change the trend and learn something from films like Dil Chahata Hai. Akshay Kumar has repeated his great performance and has proved his excellence one more time in the show business. Kareena Kapoor looks so fat, it seems she is wearing a rubber tire around her waist. Juhi Chawla has every reasons to look fat, she is married. Kiran Kumar, like every time, suits perfect in his rich father role. Over all, its just a wastage of time."
