" Overlong with weak acting and fake emotions","This should have been a pleasant family film. Unfortunately, some adult content including bikini clad babes preclude it from being suitable for young children, while adults will be bored by the tedious storytelling and listless acting. Both Amisha Patel and Saif Ali Khan phone in their performances. Rani makes a game effort and is indeed watchable. The kids are decent, but a tad too polished in their dialog delivery. Some of their emotions felt plastic. The film drags on and on including an unnecessary sojourn to the America. Watchable for kids and bored adults with nothing else to do.Overall 4/10" 
" Not much pyaar or magic but plenty of flaws","The film started off really interesting but gets more boring as it continues. The simple story was told well at the first 20 minutes but dragged very badly until the end. The whole movie was so predictable that it felt like that I've already seen it about 10 times although I've only seen it once. It reminded me of 3 films: Mary Poppins, Nanny McPhee and Hum Hai Rahi Pyaar Ke staring Aamir Khan. So it also lacks originality. The music isn't even good and the only catchy song is Lazy Lamhe. It is directed by Kunal Kohli and all of his films are rubbish except Fanaa. He is definitely overrated and I'm glad that Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic flopped at box office. The Lazy Lamhe song was so daft because Amisha Patel was singing underwater." 
" It Could Have Easily Been Thoda Bahut Better But Alas!","Kohli makes sure that 'Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic' appeals to children. It's got all the required elements: fantasy, fairy, fairy-tale story, kids etc. Adults may enjoy it with their kids but otherwise there's a lot about this film that needed improvement. Yet, it remains a tad better flick when compared to other Hindi films of this genre, such as 'Koi Mil Gaya' (ugh!).At this point, I can't say that the story is a start-to-finish ripoff (even though it feels very familiar) but it's not very original either. Kohli takes a lot of ideas from films like 'The Sound of Music', 'Nanny McPhee', 'Mary Poppins', 'Rent A Kid' and even the TV-series 'Heroes'. The movie is a little too sugar-coated for my liking but then again, kids like this kind of stuff. Some of the characters suffer from poor writing and what was the point of the butler (Razak Khan in a different avatar)? Since when did Indian business tycoon's even have butlers? Even the love story between Ranbir and Geeta is rushed. Actually, at many points the story is downright ridiculous. I mean, what was with the judge forcing the kids to be raised by their parents's murderer Ranbir?On the technical front, it scores low and this is where 'Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic' suffers. A fantasy film needs to create that fantasy feel but due to the poor special effects (it looks almost amateurish), ancient animation, unimpressive songs and flat cinematography fails to involve the viewer in its world. I wonder why the animation looked so old fashioned in this film when Kohli did a good job with it in his second film 'Hum Tum'. Considering that Yashraj productions was behind funding this film, one would have expected it to look better. Even in a lesser budgeted movie like 'Bhoothnath' the technical side is well taken care of.Saif Ali Khan does an okay job with what he's given but the transformation in his character seems rushed, choppy and of course, very hard to believe. The director fails to show why he suddenly transforms from this cold unfriendly man to a caring guardian. Not only that, but he also teaches the children life lessons that he never applied those to himself. Perhaps we are to assume that he was initially trying to be kind to the children out of guilt. Amisha Patel seems to get typecast as the annoying bimbo (she played a similar role in last years 'Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd'). She fits the caricature well. The annoying Rishi Kapoor acts drunk. The child actors are the 'usual cute kids' you see in Yashraj films but these ones actually do try to act instead of just being cute. Now the magic of this film is clearly Rani Mukherjee. She plays the part as if it was written for her (perhaps it was). She acts her part very naturally providing excellent comic relief from the sappy moments but at the same time, the character is unidimensional.The sad thing is that 'Thoda Pyaar Rhoda Magic' could have easily been a better film technically, given the financial resources of Yashraj productions (or perhaps they suffered a little too much from their last couple of flops?) and content-wise, had the story itself been a little more real without the excessive sugar and ridicule. You can watch it with kids in the hope that they'd laugh or watch it with adults who'll laugh for the wrong reasons." 
" A Good Entertainer From Yashraj","The last film from Yashraj, "Tashan," had sent shivers down my spine and made me think that this company had finally run out of good ideas  result was that it was a massive flop. But with this one, I have managed to regain some faith in the films that Yashraj is now releasing.The country's top industrialist and loner (not his will as he loses everyone he loves), causes a car accident in which parents of four children are killed. At the end of the hearing, the judge, instead of sentencing the industrialist, orders him to take care of the dead couple's children. However, the four children have other plans in mind.Directed and written by the "Hum Tum" director, Kunal Kohli, the movie stars Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Amisha Patel and Rishi Kapoor and is produced by Aditya Chopra.The story, though well written and directed, does have echoes of Walt Disney's "Mary Poppins," which starred Julie Andrews in a similar but not quite the same, role as the one portrayed by Rani Mukherjee. There are chances that she will probably receive an award for this role, if not then, she is in a very good position for a nominee. Saif, on the other hand, has also handled his role very well. But I must say that it was a change to see Rishi Kapoor in a complete different role.Conclusion: A good family entertainer that can be watched with kids." 
" Boring fairy tale and even more boring film","Yash Chopra films are mostly over the top, larger then life.etc with superficial scenes and so is TPTMThe film starts with an accident and a court scene but Amisha's character ruins it The scenes between Saif and kids are good but then comes the angel angle which is so put off and forcedIt looks like they tried to add that to appeal to the children and the big fat Rani spoils the film with her continuous speech and babyish expressionsThen we have also the heaven scenes which are boringThen we have some songs and songsWe have a predictable storyline which a child can even guessWe have the sudden change of heart of children'sWe have the stupid finale where Rani becomes a human from an angel cos she loves Saif, Yes you heard it rightSaif is natural in his role, though he frowns too much in 1st halfRani overacts, Amisha irritates the kids are okay Rishi Kapoor is a delight" 
" Disappointing on every level","When I happened upon "Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic" at my local library, knowing nothing else about this film beforehand, the DVD presentation caught my eye as a good bet for an undemanding evening's entertainment: a simple light-hearted nanny story along lines of "Mary Poppins" or "The Sound of Music", presented by a solid star cast (Rani Mukherjee, Saif Ali Khan, Amisha Patel) whose work elsewhere I have much enjoyed.How could such a project -- with so many good things going for it -- go so terribly wrong?"Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic", however, disappoints in every way.The script/dialogues were so stale and hackneyed the writer should be shot at dawn.The director (Kunal Kohli) was asleep at the switch. Or so obsessed with packaging a 'commercial' project from tired formulae that he disregarded any concern with sense or quality.['Commercialism' didn't work. The film lost money bigtime, anyway.]Casting? The four children (who looked completely unalike) cast in the key roles as the four orphans at the heart of the story have to be THE least engaging, THE least talented, even THE least 'likeable' child actors I've seen in any movie for many years ... such completely unappealing, even outright repulsive children, that while watching this movie I found myself actually thinking the dead parents had had a lucky escape!Rishi Kapoor's cameo appearance as God -- and a strangely ineffectual god at that, whether large or small "G" -- was a complete throwaway, underwritten and charmless.What bothered me about this film most of all, I think, was the fundamental 'meanness of spirit' that pervaded the whole movie ... a meanness, even open maliciousness, that felt especially out of place given the genre and context.Even music by the normally gifted Shankar Ehsaan Loy couldn't save this turkey."2" rather than "1" (IMDb's lowest possible rating) purely to credit actors Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Amisha Patel, and Sharat Saxena for their brave efforts, through individual performance, to try bringing anything useful whatsoever out of their poorly conceived and badly written characters in this hopelessly failed story." 
" Magic Created A Third Time","An enjoyable movie that keeps you smiling till the end. Unfortunately, Saif Ali Khan looked old but nevertheless played his part well. Bubbly Rani was very nice nanny making you wish she was at your house. On the negative side, her dress made her look too conservative that you stopped liking it after some time. Amisha played her roll well- that is she actually had something to do. Her look was sporty and modern. The children were very outstanding, making you remember your childhood. I was amazed that the animation looked quite real. I was expecting it to look cheap but it turned out to be just as good as a Hollywood animated film. The screenplay was very strong and the cinematography was wonderful. The songs were outstanding and addicting. Pyaar Ke Liye, Nihaal Ho Gaye, Lazy Lahme has tunes you'll never forget. The comedy was thoughtful and funny. Nothing but praises for this film!!!" 
" Lots of Pyar--Thoda Magic.","The Story and direction is by Kunal Kohli who used to be Film Critic before he started wielding his own megaphone. The Story if original or borrowed is purely poignant. Now the Cast-Saif Ali Khan is a great actor but he is so overworked he probably does't even know which set, what scene or what emotion to portray. He goes thru the film with an "attitude" or a fixed demeanor that is becoming very familiar. Where as Rani gives one hundred percent of herself. The kids have a good potential, specially the kid that plays the older girl. The Scene with God and Angels sitting around is immaculately done with some great camera work and sets. Rishi Kapoor is "God"-a part that Amitab Bachchan used to have firm grip on, But Kapoor, is good whether he is playing "God" or a mere mortal. The movie has some week moments like the pool escapade. What was the point in this? was this in the Angel's job description? I wonder. The San Diego excursion even though approved by the Judge, kind of diluted the proceedings that otherwise had a homely feeling to it. All said and done this is good movie with some terrific words of wisdom and few lessons to learn. Rani, was portraying an Angel...but her acting was down-to-earth and saved Saif..Kunal...and Yash Raj Films." 
" Thoda Fantasy Thoda Fun","This film was really great! All the characters acted really well. I liked Rani Mukherjee's acting very much: she was a fairy and a messenger of God. I liked her very much in the "Bubbly" song.Rani Mukhurjee was fantastic in her roles. She was really natural, and made all the kids to like Saif Ali Khan. Indeed, he became close to them. He understood how they must be feeling without their parents, so he wanted to be like a proper father. He tried to get closer to all of them by understanding their feelings. He helped Aditi by winning a cooking contest (ofcourse with the help of Rani's magic). Rani Mukherjee really had fun with the children. Especially when Iqbal tried to make a spider fall on her face, she turned it into a butterfly. The funny part was that the spider fell on his face after the magic was over.Rani is the perfect one for a fairy. Her expression and her passion was tremendous. She acted extremely well.Saif was good in his role. The transformation from a carefree person to a loving person, was simply great. He was himself in the movie and showed his natural liking for kids.The kids gave an outstanding performance. Their dialogs were not robotic and were full of emotions. Most of all, they really enjoyed playing their roles.Please do not miss out on this wonderful movie! This movie is for all age groups. It celebrates both childhood and parenthood." 
" Thoda payar Thoda Magic","So I watched one of the most anticipated movie of the year TPTM with high hopes and enthusiasm, but did I get what I was hoping for? Well.. you will find out at the end of my review.The movie is about four kids who had a horrible tragedy and end up living with Saif Ali khan.. Now, that's all I'm gonna say about the story or else I'd be spoiling the whole maza.Good thing about TPTM is that as soon as you are seated, the drama has started, it will keep you captivated till the very end , and that's the plus sign of any Bollywood flick considering they are longer than usual Hollywood drama...ActingSaif: He is a natural actor, he is one of the finest actors we have in Bollywood and Yes, he did justice to his role.. he was very convincing and I challenged any actor who can do this role better than him. This role was meant for him.. Period! Amisha Patel: It's not her fault she can't act, it's the director's fault who had asked her to share the screen with Rani Mukerji.. when these ladies were face to face, you cant help but cringe.. cause it was black & white.. day & night..apple & oranges.. Yellow & green ( Amisha really needs to work on her acting skills).. I hope sharing screen with Rani & saif will bring the best out of her, and hopefully she has learned something from them.. but one thing I liked about her was her sex appeal, she looked very beautiful no doubt but that's about it.Kids: Adorable... very very cute and quite witty.. the little girl was so funny, every time she said " Merey to koi baat hi nahi sonta hey" with a long face, I burst out laughing.. she was adorable, but that sardar kid was damn hilarious too.. and the oldest brother as well as the girl who was in SRK game show did incredibly well.. these kids can be future stars, if they keep performing like that.Rishi K : Well, it was a cameo role for him and he did what he had asked to do, he looked cute and was very funny.. nothing much to say to that.. so moving onRani Mukerji: All hail the queen.. the majesty, the lovable, the most adorable Rani Muekrji.. she was the fresh breath of this movie.. absolutely fantastic, you can easily say that she lifted the entire movie on her shoulders. Her dialog delivery was marvelous, very convincing which definitely bring tears to your eyes.Songs: Here comes the interesting part, although you would fall in love with all the songs once you watch the movie, cause it makes much better sense as we are going through some emotions.. but some songs can dominate other depending who is the audience ... but if you are a big Rani fan, you'd love Bulbula.. when she appeared in the song, every one in my theater hall was breathless .. she looked like a real fairy, long hair.. sexy eyes, stunning smile, that song was the high light of the film, the way it was filmed with visual effects, I have never seen it before in Bollywood and in Hollywood, so yeah I loved that song with the bottom of my heart... but if you ask kids to pick their favorite song, they would say it's "Betay Kal say" that takes the cake.. it was shot in the museum and done it really well, I enjoyed every moment of it (only if these museum do exist in real life.. *sigh).. If you ask a young, love, dove couple, ask for their favorite song, they'd say it was "Nihal Ho gaye" cause that song had so much emotions involved in it, and the lyrics were amazing, a romantic song which brings Saif and Rani together.. and they share a great chemistry.. but if you ask older people to pick their preferred song, they'd say "Payr key leye" and believe me guys, that song is very sad and bring tears to your eyes.. but the one song which every one can sing along and do little booty shaking is none other than "Lazy Lamhey" it was very well done, and AMisha looked very hot in it ( but I found it way way to hot, especially when all four kids were around) you watch it and let me know if you agree with me or not... but I must say, after this song, singing under water would be a new trend in Bollywood.. that song was top notch.. well done Kunal.. kudos to you! Kunal has taken a risk to direct a movie which is based on fantasy and reality, and I must say that he has broken the seal.. now more directors will follow his lead and make similar movies.. but I will say it with confidence that Kunal is a saving grace for YRF.. he has done a great job and deserves a standing ovation.Overall, it was a very good movie, I liked it.. enjoyed it and yes I can now proudly say, that I got what I was hoping for.. go watch it with your family, you wont be disappointed!" 
" It's a completely watchable children's film.","Simplistic in its premise and basic in its treatment, Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic is what you could call a 'by-the-book' children's film. It's predictable every step of the way, but it's still an easy watch because the kids at the centre of this story are so endearing, they suck you into their story even though their story itself doesn't throw up any surprises. The gags are old-fashioned, and the special effects rather ordinary, but despite the shortcomings the film works because it's never contrived. Sure it tends to get preachy at times, but Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic has its heart in the right place. And in this age of such mindless children's entertainment as violence-themed videogames and comedies filled with sexual innuendo, a simple good-natured morality tale is not such a bad thing after all. What Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic could have done without, is that inappropriate Lazy Lamhe song with the camera lingering lovingly on Ameesha Patel's every curve. Also the film overstays its welcome when it drudges on for a good 15 minutes after the kids have resolved their issues with Ranbir Talwar. The romantic track between Ranbir and Geeta seems obligatory at best, and it doesn't help that Saif and Rani have zero chemistry together. In director Kunal Kohli's Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic, four kids who have lost their parents in a road accident are packed off to live with the man responsible for their parents' death. Saif Ali Khan plays Ranbir Talwar the hard-nosed businessman who opens his home to the kids, but can't seem to reach out to them emotionally. Of the cast, Rishi Kapoor is wasted as the Lord up there, saddled with a role he can't seem to make head nor tail of, drifting through his lines mechanically. Heaven too, seems like an odd place, populated as it is by angels who behave more like witches, bickering and bitching each other out. Surprise, surprise, Amisha Patel is spot-on as Ranbir's bimbo girlfriend, stealing every scene that she's in. Meanwhile, Rani Mukherji as Geeta is surprisingly a little out of form. But that has more to do with her poorly written role than it does with Rani's at-best-satisfactory performance. It's a shame, the writers fail to exploit the actress' natural charm and invest some of that charm into her role. Saif Ali Khan slips naturally into the role of the nostril-flaring Ranbir Talwar. Saif invests sincerity in his character, making him vulnerable and endearing. But Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic is about the children, and the actors in those roles perform exceptionally. All four kids play their parts convincingly, and for a film about kids pestering the living daylights of a grown man, surprisingly you never once want to wring their necks. Of the four child actors, I have to single out little Rachit Sidana who plays Sardar kid Iqbal – he is so adorable, so fragile, your heart goes out to him spontaneously. Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic is not great cinema, but it's a completely watchable children's film. As a movie it's just about average, but bonus points for the kids who keep your interest alive throughout.This one's strictly for the kids, it's an enjoyable one-time watch, you won't complain." 
" A Decent Entertainer","Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic is similar to films like Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke and Marry Poppins. The film basically offers nothing new unless you didn't watch these two films you could go ahead and give Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic a try.After films like Hum Tum and Fanaa, it was quite disappointing from Kunal Kohli to come up with an ordinary product. Although he manages to extract good performances from the child artistes, he could've come up with a better storyline since its nothing new.The songs are just about average; Lazy Lamhe stands out amongst the rest of the songs and the music video is well-shot, although too sensual for a kids film.Saif Ali Khan is good and fits the part perfectly. Rani Mukerji is cute as the angel, but her role is not very demanding. Ameesha Patel is remarkable as the airhead bimbo. She looks sizzling in Lazy Lamhe. Rishi Kapoor is good, but his role is not very demanding, again, for an actor of his seniority. The child artistes are excellent, especially Rachit Sidana.All in all, Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic mainly belongs to the four kids. A decent entertainer! Kids will probably love it." 
" Not Perfect, but Certainly a Pleasure","Ranbeer (Saif Ali Khan), a recalcitrant workaholic, kills a couple in a car accident. The judge gives the unusual ruling that the four children left orphaned by the accident are to live with him. All five are miserable and pray for help. God (Rishi Kapoor) hears their pleas and sends his favorite angel, Geeta (Rani Mukerji), to help them become a family.This is a sweet movie that, with the exception of one song, is oriented to family viewers, and gives uplifting messages about loss, prayer, and God. Khan is perfect for the role, gradually going from gruff and brooding to open and loving. He and Mukerji have good chemistry. She is her usual perky, cheerful self, and makes a delightful angel. Kapoor is excellent in his minor role. The children play their parts well. The music is average, with very little choreography. Overall, this film, while not perfect, is certainly a pleasure"

" Wow! So many things in one movie  it's making me dizzy.","Congratulations to director Kunal Kohli for setting up his own production house and joining hands with Yashraj to take on his first venture as a director/producer. Well, he doesn't really have to prove himself because this is his fourth time around as a director and he has matured with his profession. Director Kohli is out this time with a magical fairy tale based in contemporary Delhi revolving around a lonesome handsome and four kids whose parents get killed in a car accident.Awkward (but it's cinema again) the judge orders Ranveer to take the kids home and unwillingly they start living under one roof but no one is really happy with each other. Then things start taking place very quickly, before you can fully grasp the situation the story has already moved far ahead and you desperately try to catch up. Anyway, that again perfectly justifies the fast-paced first 10 minutes where a young Ranveer grows up to a man (I loved the scene where he gets up and starts walking before his name is announced in a business award-giving.) and hits his car into an unfortunate couples'.The eldest of the kids decides to take revenge and come to Ranveer's house. Then some really silly sequences follow that are absolutely out of place that even a seven year old would simply reject. Then comes in this incredibly noisy yet sweet and lovable fairy Geeta (Rani Mukerji). Gee, I would not have an angel by that name and definitely not a God (Rishi Kapoor) with funny beard. Then there is this dumb girlfriend of Ranveer (Amisha Patel) and an eccentric butler. The kids have presented a magnificent performance, full points to them.Kunal Kohli yet again shows his inclination towards western flicks and even managed to squeeze in a quick Night in the Museum sequence in a song and even managed to tell how great his country is. Then there is this pool party clearly inappropriate for little ones to be attending. Kohli even manages to pay homage to popular songs of yesteryears in a car ride sequence.Wow! So many things in one movie  it's making me dizzy.It also comes to show how the musical trio of Shanker Ehsaan Loy have exhausted and begun making songs similar (compare Pyaar ke Liye and Taare Zameen Par) to the ones they previously composed. Javed Akthar's pretty is yet again gripping. Cinematography and editing is so so  I don't think it's so great for a SFX movie like this. I think the harness scenes looked pretty stiff and awkward (perhaps the actors had no experience working on harnesses.) The scenes in heaven could've been more better. Little animation sequences that pop up in the middle are distracting and inconsistent.Though it was absolutely unimportant to take the story to LA in the last act, I think it was still great watching the inside of Hollywood theme parks and specially the scene where Rani uses her magical powers to transform the "H" of Hollywood into a "B." Anyways, I would say that take your children to watch the film but not sure whether they'll be able to grasp all the punches. Anyway, take them  at least they'll enjoy the special effects and comedy and the kids." 
" touching","Well, of course, you might think that this movie is a kind of make-over and mix of many movies: from Nanny McPhee, Oh God, to A night at the museum, and such titles. But when you have a closer look at this movie, it is a complete different story, and very original. OK, the nanny in this movie is also making sure that a bunch of kids and their "dad" are going to love each other. But that's about it.First of all, the fact that a tragic accident, and a court order are the cause of all this, is already completely different. The movie has some kids who are playing really well, their is a great sense of humor and at the same time you can't escape it's serious subject.Minor things, like the religious mash potato they are trying to serve you, as if all religions are alike, you take for granted.It is a great family movie, good for the holiday season, and some people might even need a hankie. But take it for what it is, a fun movie, enjoyable with the kids."
