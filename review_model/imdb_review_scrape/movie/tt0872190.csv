" What Cash Really stands for - Crap Awful Sad Horrible","Let me start by saying that I like actor Ajay Devgan, and loved Omkara, and when I heard about Cash, I was only expecting good things... at least until the movie started that is.The dialogue in this movie is awful, and the script is non existence, people come and go with absolutely no point, and the film makers got lazy during some of the action scenes or maybe they went over budget so they thought they can get away with it by putting cartoons whenever the action was "too hot to handle" so to say...oh how wrong they were.The movie had no clue of what to do as it jumped from one scene to next without making or trying to make sense, this movie has no meaning, the situations are there to show different actors doing different things, and to fill up 3 hours.Ajay Devgan had his moments in the movie, and while Esha Deol was adorable, Shamita shetty proved she can not act.The cleavage in movies now a days seems to be increasing, as there was lot of that in there, not that I am complaining but if only more work was done on the script and production, it would not be such a waste, what I don't understand is how can someone read the script of a movie such as this and think of making a movie with it.The way I see it the script was three pages, first page would have been cast and crew, third page credits and second page...missing.In one word I can sum up cash as dreadful, it's the kind of movie that you watch and afterwords, you don't feel like your money is gone or even that it is over, but that 3 hours of your life have gone away and will never come back.Don't watch this movie if you are looking for something meagerly entertaining." 
" It should have been called Trash instead of Cash","I had a dinner invitation at a family friend's, and they decided to watch 'Cash'. I didn't want to be rude so I didn't object. Anubhav Sinha does a good job on spending the producer's cash on set design, animation, location and special effects among other technical gizmo's. It all looks both tacky and out of place. The reason why I say spend instead of waste is because probably the producer will make a lot of bucks out of Trash. Depends on the majority of Indian audience, doesn't it? Of course the screenplay is pretty trash and direction is pretty amateurish. Sinha seems to love slow motion as almost every action and chase scene has shots of tiring slow motion that drag on. This film also tries to show that hot women are stupid. After brilliantly playing intelligent women in 'Fareb' and 'Zeher', Shamita Shetty decided to play a bimbo and she's probably one of the stupidest head security officer. Ajay Devgan should not have attempted any comedy. He's quite bad. Question for Sunil Shetty: Why are you still in films? Of course Cash boasts of more non-talents. Dia Mirza looks hot and plays stupid. Ayesha Takia, Esha Deol, Zayed Khan and Riteish Deshmukh are also stupid. Deol does show off her nice body but what happened to the rest? This is really a bad waste of time. But it will appeal to many who love their hot women to be stupid and the guys to be stronger and only marginally smarter and it also helps if there are some cheesy action scenes and pathetic gadgets and crap. 'Cash' is Trash No 1!" 
" Don't waste your cash","I was looking forward to this film because it was the same director (Anubhav Sinha) of the relentless thriller Dus and the trailer looked really cool but the film was so disappointing. The whole film was Extremely boring that I had a sore head & I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. The film was nearly 3 hours and had only 10 minutes of action. I just don't know what is the gender? If its action then there is hardly any. If its thriller then it wasn't even a jot thrilling. If its comedy then it lacks a single decent joke basically it has nothing. While I was watching it I had six breaks, not one, not two but six breaks, which is the most I ever had for any movie.There was an animated sequence every 5 or 10 minutes which was very, very irritating because you can't have 2 moods for a film. There is a proper way of putting animated sequence in a film e.g. Karam had a very sensible way but the director Anubhav Sinha won't understand that. The only good scene was the song Reham Kare because of the awesome cinematography quite similar to Sin City and the wonderful red dress of the dancer. Music is terrific composed by one of my favourite composers Vishal & Shekhar. The best songs are Cash, Reham Kare & Naughty Naughty but what is the use of it in a really bad film? I was more interested in the film's ending not because the twist or anything would be revealed in the last reel but because it would mean the end of discomfiture of the so-called action thriller. There was a twist but it didn't make me jump off my seat and say WOW! in movies like Naqaab & Dead Silence. Overall after watching good for nothing Cash I nearly died of boredom and my personal advice would be to avoid this film. Save your cash and wait for Don 2 & Dhoom 3 for decent Bollywood action movie." 
" Made me forget what a good movie is like...","Gosh, I was hoping for something crazy cool and ended up whiling away a few hours with something that was crazy crap. Its as good as a bunch of random clips stuck together, and every neat scene is replaced with some bad cartoon placeholder. Like, WHAT! If I were the editor I'd have slapped the director for imaging that to be a MOVIE. Last I checked a movie was a story told in the form of a video, and here I was watching crap told in the form of a wannabe video. For all the neat marketing they did, who'd have thought that crap would've been the result...maybe they'll do us a favor and title the movie CRAP next time...Lets hope to god that Bollywood shuts this movie away for the rest of forever and all directors keep in mind to never pull another Cash..." 
" Cash Sucks CASH out of your Pocket!","There is no storyline! This is a complete waste of time.Screen shots are just put together without a flow.It jumps to animation when the action scene comes up.Biggest FLOP of the year so far in Bollywood! Don't watch this movie.Even the beginning intro song is a bore! Don't waste your time or CASH! I can't believe that the film was even edited. I don't think the actors or the director even watched the film all at one.I should have seen the reviews before going out to see it. The action packed scenes are taken away with the animation. Some of the action is worse then that of a cartoon. The storyline just doesn't fit because there is none!" 
" 2 hours something minutes of my life never coming back.","I recently got an opportunity to see Cash, well I wasn't expecting much from the film but even then it was a disappointing affair.Even though the movie has an excellent line up of stars, some how their true potential could not be extracted.A lot of animation was unnecessarily used in this movie perhaps to save money which would otherwise have been used for SFX. The movie had so many goofs, it seemed the editing team was asleep while cutting the final prints.All in all Ajay Devgan has some good moments but they are a far cry from saving this move. Watch this at your own risk." 
" What a mess...","A horrible film. Simply horrible. Much worse than might be expected of a cast, most of whom have at least played a few really good roles in their lives. My expectations weren't particularly high, and I definitely didn't expect a masterpiece; but even truckloads of popcorn can't turn this movie into something remotely entertaining. I did my very best to follow the story somehow, in spite of its (to put it gently) fragmentary beginning. After that, however, all sense is lost completely, until nobody knows anymore who is chasing whom and what for. Utter chaos. The animated sequences that somehow manage to amuse in the beginning, become irritating soon. I have a strong impression that the director of this movie tries to imitate Oliver Stone's manners, but whereas Stone uses them as a means to convey something, in this case it's nothing but tricks. Add a few misplaced comic sequences to the mix, lots of action sequences that would have worked if we knew at least what they are about, and there you have it. It looks like they tried damned hard to conceal a lack of budget and a lack of script, but failed on both accounts. Expect for the title song, which is sort of funny, the songs aren't worth mentioning either. The background score is better, in my opinion. As for the acting: Ajay: not bad, but nothing particularly good either.Zayed: how is it possible that this actor keeps on playing in movies, despite an obvious lack of talent? Ritesh: a nice role and well performed. The most bearable part in the whole movie, if you ask me.Sunil: completely colorless, which is a pity, because he's too good an actor for this type of junk. Esha: never liked her until I saw "Darling"; not too bad in this movie, I'd say. Diya: hard to say. I like her, but I don't know why myself. Shamita: it took me a while before I was sure this wasn't Shilpa, but Shilpa's younger sister. They are very similar to each other, in the same way as Kareena and Karisma are. Not so bad either." 
" Total crap!!!","Well, honestly I expected a better movie from Anubhav Sinha. He did an okay job with DUS. With CASH, he bowls a complete zero. The story wasn't thought out well. I wonder if there was a script at all! Nothing is in place in this movie. Ajay Devgan looks bored and his pairing with Shamita Shetty looks odd. Shamita impresses with her stunts but the script lets her down. Zayed Khan has style and can go miles in the future. Riteish looks somewhat bored too but does an okay job in the comedy department. Esha Deol was a huge disappointment! Suniel Shetty was utterly ridiculous as the villain. He is an actor who never got the opportunity to invest his talent in a good movie. And judging by his looks and age, we better hope for his retirement from acting as soon as possible! Dia Mirza did what she has to do and that was about it. She does nothing to rise above a mundane script. CASH would've been an exciting, never-before-seen action thriller of Bollywood. But the script lets it down completely. The climax was so disappointing that you feel like shooting the writers to death. Avoid!!!" 
" Whom was this movie made for v/s What were they thinking?!!","Once again I found myself in TOP 3 the only multiplex (with AC no less) in Bhavnagar and in the midst of a cultural battlefield not only between my South Bombay urban sensibilities and what can best be described as a city that losing the battle to be Urban, but also among the different kinds of people within the same theatre.The differences between the gold (Rs 75 on weekends ) and Silver (Rs. 50) which i hadn't noticed in the last movie (Krissh) I saw there were now apparent to me, the lines of Gutkha that run between the rows of seats in the silver class are a legacy that the so called "PUBLIC" leave behind, that clearly demarcates the differences between the two kinds of people within the same theatre.The movie was house-full and the whistles just before the movie started assured me that even though i had close to no expectations from this movie (bored on a Sunday in another city), thanks to the excitement around me i would at least not be bored in this film.And this movie started well enough with the occasional splash on animation that has been inspired, but a great change. The animations were kind of cool and humorous at the same time and my expectations were going up.At the same time i was getting a bit confused maybe this movie was being made for the urban audience, WHAT WITH THE ALL English TITLES AND SUBTITLES AND THE HEAVY USAGE OF English WITH ENTIRE DIALOGUES IN English.The movie went along at a fine pace, with the planning of a big heist, some great camera work,some decent animation, good songs, and a nice dose of humour, AJAY DEVGAN LOOKED ABSOLUETELY HIDEOUS but that was fine.The movie made a slow steady climb uphill and then the plateau came..THE HIEST was an altogether confusing yet entertaining experience amid loud catcalls and whistles, scene after scene that were really there to dazzle the audiences, NO LOGIC HERE and this was when the movie truly moved on to front bencher territory, nobody who has watched even 2 or 3 good heist films (even dhoom for that matter ) was going to be able to find logic in the absurd events that followed.To their credit though the ritiesh scene, and the Ajay Devgan scene was actually good even by my high standards.YET THE OBSESSION WITH English CONTINUED MORE AND MORE DIALOGUES WERE BEING RECITED IN English, and so were the subtitles, no one wore a single Indian dress in the whole film not even in the songs, at this point of time i was seriously getting confused, for whom after all was this movie being made for.Then the second half started and semblance of logic was flushed away, THE MARKED MONEY TRACK WAS ESPECIALLY DISGUSTING.The questions about the target audience were clearly replaced by WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??? Animation that seemed cool in the first half was abused beyond compare, esha looked hideous, Ajay looked worse if possible, there still was time for some songs....If the urban audience was the target they clearly got it all wrong.But still there were some things going for the movie, DIYA MIRZA LOOKED SMOKING HOT, THE SONGS WERE GOOD AND ESPECIALLY WELL PICTURISED, the one liners were especially good and the constant dry, as well as slapstick humour was always entertaining.The scene with blowing money was especially well picturised. Acting was good throughout with no one really doing a bad job, most of the junior actors (though they've been around for 5 rs or more) still need lots of work, even then TECHNICALLY THIS MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD but still a notch below trend-setters like Don and Dhoom 2 (Especially don).So why the not so bad rating..For starters for whatever reasons i actually got how much i expected form this movie and enjoyed it in parts ANY MOVIE MEETING TIME PASS SPECIFICATIONS DESERVES A 5 (im sure the crowd had something to do with it).What i was told by my local friend however summed up the movie for me in the other sides eyes (even though we were in gold)."Mujhe Kuch Samajh Mein Nahin Aaya, Phir Bhi Mazaa Aaya, scene scenery, Maja Masti aur fighting Badiya Tha Haaauun", translated "I didn't understand anything but still i enjoyed it the scene-scenery (cinematography), Maja Masti (chicks in gujrat maja-masti is always something to do with chicks be it talking or other activities), and the stunts/action scenes were very good (the haauun is the standard anding phrase is gujrat its like a nasal ho).Im not sure you want to watch this movie because if your on this forum you probably fall in my category of viewer.Watch with caution at cheap rates if you have to watch it.-s NO LOGIC, abuse of animation, to much English, pathetic script.+/-s maja-masti, scene scenery.+s good songs and picturisation, a couple of great scenes, good humour.total 5/10 (on absolute terms even and considering it met the very low expectations, if you have slightly more upmarket sensibilities than i do, then this is definitely a NO)." 
" Mind Blowing Mahiya !!","It simply blew my mind off. What was Director thinking while directing this movie ? I am sure he must have shown it to others before it was released, did no one tell him how much he has goofed up.It could have been an interesting plot, but thanks to direction, editing and screenplay it never blooms properly.And as couple of posts earlier, the cartoons sucked, not sure what was the team thinking, but cartoons spoiled the show. Whenever it was time for real action, they threw in cartoons and killed the excitement, which anyways was hard to build.**To be avoided at any cost**" 
" A Big Let-Down","This movie was very highly awaited, a multi-starrer movie with all the big names casting in it. But this movie has rather been a big disappointment.Nothing in the movie was convincing except the exceptional songs but even the songs were put in the wrong place and at the wrong time. It is not like any other movie in which all the scenes would be put together to make out a logical film but was rather a film where the director wants to show us some good cars, a hell lot of stunts, thats it! I think I'll have to watch the movie again to understand the movie properly. All in all, I would say a poor film. I'll give it 3/10" 
" Well, forcible comedy with confused multi-cast movie","Well, Anubhav Sinha really disappointed with this movie, which was quite expected. Forcebal comedy, on which i got frustrated.The actions in this movies was worst ever i haven seen. I got confused whether it is cartoon movies or real movie !!! well songs were good. About cast , Ajay Devgan looks good along with Ritesh Deshmukh.Well what u expect from Sunil Shetty !! Eisha looks sexy with her dance, rest Shamita and Diya Mirza were just showcase girl in the movie.Well at end , i guess i wasted my 3 valuable hours. Very poor direction, with weak story line.My advise _ WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK. I bet you will waste Ur cash in it." 
" Cash Cash, Oh my cash!!","Well I just came back from the movie, and it motivated me so much to share my painful experience with you. The movie is lame and awful, sorry for being rude but fact is fact and no one can amend it. Movie starts with nice music track and you expect more to come with such a dramatic opening, but the entire thrill is gone within no time. The reason being:1) Stunts are in cartoon. "WTF!! Are we there to watch cartoon network, and where the hell Tom and Jerry are". 2) Where the hell is choreographer? "Oh! I know the entire budget was spent on payment of superstars". 3) Can somebody teach Diya some acting please, and especially the scene where you are suppose to play dead, you do not have to breath so heavily that even a blind man can see you are breathing after being shoot. Well, were you paid less as compared to other actors, to give such marvellous performance? 4) Please our films should stop adding bits and pieces of English in between dialogues; it really brings down an essence of the movie if you deliver the English flanks in Indian ascent.Apart from that there were some bit of fun from Ajay, but when other actors try to crack jokes it went really to the drain. I would personally do not recommend this film, u will njoy 'Full and Final' far more than "Oh! What I am saying, how can I even compare 'Full and Final' with this", oh yes 'Cash' is worse that any other film, even worse that B grade movies.All I can say in the end is, Cash Cash, give my Cash BACK." 
" Trash","Cash directed by Anubhav Sinha is pure crap.The story is stupid.The screenplay is okay.The stunts are comic-book type.The music is average.The cinematography is very good.The dialogs make no sense Performances-Ajay Devgn acts well.Suniel Shetty is so funny,especially in the scene when Devgn calls him and hear the accent of Shetty.You will break into guffaws.This was the only scene which brought me smile.Ritesh Deshmukh,Zayed Khan,Shamita Shetty,Esha Deol and Diya Mirza are wasted.On the whole Cash is Trash!" 
" Hideous crap","DUS was an awful film but CASH makes it a classicThe film was supposedly incomplete too and hence Ajay fought with Anubhav SinhaThe film is awful and mixing animation makes it all the more amateurish The plot is done to death and the execution is nothing commendable In fact you may fall to sleep in 5 minutes The film starts off with an item song in DUS BAHANE style, Ajay Devgan looks weird in it The film moves in the most unappealing fashion and adding Ayesha Takia adds to the boredomNothing works in the filmAnubhav Sinha does a bad job Music is okaySFX is okayAjay Devgan sleepwalks and looks bored, Suneil is as usual Zayed is okay, Ritiesh is decent Shamita is good Dia is okay Esha is a waste" 
" Vomit inducing.","The film opens with Danny (Zayed Khan) boarding an plane. A girl named Ria (Ayesha Takia), enters the flight, talking very loudly and rudely to a somebody on her phone, irrationally arguing as to why people should not travel on airplanes. She even mistreats the cabin crew and casually asks Danny to put something in her bag. Seeing an opportunity to talk to her as they are both alone in the business section of the flight, he introduces himself as Dhananjay Jumbevalkar and craftily manages to engage her in a conversation and they decide that over the course of the journey, he will tell her a story of three unique diamonds worth 200 carats each.The story begins in 1836 where a miner in Southern India finds a diamond as he mines coal. The miner gives the diamond to his king, who in turn gives it to an English Viceroy. However, the ship in which the Viceroy is traveling sinks and the diamond, too, is lost at sea. Many years later, the diamond is found by a fisherman in Bulgaria, who gives it to the ruler."
