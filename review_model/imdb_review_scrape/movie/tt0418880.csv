" Decent story; Karishma is a show stealer","Okay, so we all know this story is not the most original one around being quite similar to the likes of Fatal Attraction, Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya, Aitraaz, Gupt, etc. However, one thing that set this movie slightly apart is Karishma's character. She is more realistic and is not portrayed as simply an evil vamp. All characters are shown to have gray shades. Akshay is shown to fall into temptation and lust resulting in him having an affair. Amisha is not Miss Goody-Goody Indian housewife but admits that she will not be able to trust Akshay completely after what he's done. Karishma doesn't go on a murdering rampage to kill Amisha but is frustrated and feels defeated by the failure of her sincere love and feelings. All three characters are shown to be more realistic. Karishma's performance is absolutely magnificent, though it can be debatable if it's as good as Priyanka in Aitraaz. The title song and "Jabse Mile Ho Tum" are quite melodious tracks." 
" "Fatal Attraction" Meets "Aitraaz" & it's NOT a pretty picture!","I am sorry to say that I actually had some expectations of this movie. Being Karisma's first film in some years.BUT this film did NOT DELIVER! I was disappointed with the plot, and the way that the story unfolded. The story could have been a real success if the script had been better. The characters where dull, accept for Karisma who does the Glenn Close/Fatal Attraction thing, quite convincingly.I thought that if they had not made the movie such a clich√© it would have been better. It would have been far superior if the guy went to NYC, and finds himself attracted to another women, and starts a relationship with her. (NOT have a one night stand, and then start wondering how he's going to get out of it!) If he's torn between his love and loyalty for his long standing girlfriend and his attraction and passion for a stranger,it would have made the story more interesting. The story as it is could have worked too, if the girlfriend had not been portrayed as a saint, and the inevitable "I can die for him, can you"? competition had not irrevocably ruined things! Obsessive love has been portrayed in a very successful way in films many times. There is no reason that it could not have been done here. But the plot and dialogues are too mediocre and aside from Karisma (even though sometimes she was a bit over the top), the rest of the acting was mediocre at best. Especially Akshay who is a talented actor who can do better. He really needs to break free from these "up and coming rock star" roles. He has outgrown them and he's selling himself short by continuing to portray them. Amisha Patel does her worst acting to date in this film, and she looks insipid and down right annoying!Once again the Indian film manages try to insult and undermine Western Culture by suggesting that "one night stands" are the norm in America. (And consequently in the Western World) which is NOT quite accurate. Akshay's character tells Karisma that she is an American and one night stands are the norm in her country.Therefore, she should stop making a fuss about feeling "used".Karisma has to qualify that she is an American of "Indian" ethnic origin, as a way of justifying her feelings of outrage at being used for sex and discarded. When will Indian films stop undermining Western culture, and portraying the west as morally bankrupt, as means of showcasing their own superiority?The music was all right. I only liked one song. "Jab Se Mile Ho Tum", which actually took the plot forward and showcased Krisma's character's feelings very well. The lyrics and music of that song are n-sync. The rest of the songs where un-memorable.My overall feeling about this film is disappointment. At the end of it I was left wondering what went wrong!" 
" Maran Saathi","I tend to avoid Suneel Darshan films because they are usually pathetic. The reason why I gave this one a go was because I'd heard that Karishma Kapoor was doing a negative role and I wanted to see how she pulled that off. Karishma really hams her way through (like she does in almost all her films) by overdoing her seductress act. Kudos to the person who accurately describes her as a combination of a stoned Marlene Dietrich and the psychopathic rabbit from 'Watership Down'. Due to lousy dialogues and bad direction Akshay Kumar's performance does suffer. Perhaps he just did the movie as a favour because he looks as though he could care less. Amisha Patel isn't acting. She's rehearsing for a soap opera. 'Mere Jeevan Saathi' may have made for an episode of a TV soap. The songs are plain boring but I liked 'Mashooka' because of its catchiness and Alisha Chinoy's voice. There isn't much else to say regarding this film because it's all atrocious." 
" Rubbish","This is a dreadful film....I cannot forgive anyone in the making or acting in this film...The end was just the thing i was hoping did not occur... stupid people and their stupid thinking it was by no means a good ending or any decent ending... Some people in this film should have died ages ago that did not happen and just lead to more time wasted watching this movie...Karisma looked good but even she could not deliver in this appalling film, the other actress A Patel, well we all know she cannot act anyway but god damn was she bad in this film or what... It felt like a theatre rehearsal that went really bad... Why wasn't A patel killed?? More anger, more death better script would have been good... 'Anjaam' the movie should have been used as guidance.Akshay has a major role but is sidelined by poor dialogues, script and poor selection all together...People who conceived this film and thought its good should be executed...The best sequence is Karisma's dance on glass.. thats what gets it a one out of ten i would have given it a zero otherwise." 
" Worst Film of the decade..Karishma makes a disastrous comeback","This is simply one of the Worst Bollywood movies ever made. Planetbollywood.com have announced this as the Worst Film of the year. I believe its one of the Worst Films ever made coming from a director who usually makes good or decent movies. It Truly is disappointing to see a talented Actor Akshay Kumar, who is going throw a series of Big Hit movies in his career, suddenly adding this Super Flop in his filmography. The movie marks a comeback for Karishma Kapoor, who plays an obsessive character, which has been repeated hundreds of times already in Bollywood. Karishma tries to impress in scenes by overacting just like her previous films (Biwi No.1, Ek Rishta, Dulhan hum le jayenge, Hum saath saath hai ETC) Good scripts gone to waste. The movie also stars the very sexy Amisha Patel, but even she couldn't save the film. For those who haven't seen this movie, its a simple tale about a married man who gets successful with the help of a woman. The woman now wishes to marry him buy going through desperate measures, including killing herself. The Main reason this filmed bombed was the ending where Akshay marries her dead body, and his wife happily accepts this? I really hope Bollywood will make these dreadful movies but it keeps coming back. What is Bollywood gonna think of next" 
" Delayed","This film was started in 2001 and released in 2006 after lot of delayKarisma too retired till the film released, Amisha became a 0 and Akshay Kumar had begin to start signing better filmsThe film is similar to AITRAAZ and released 2 yrs later then AITRAAZ though it started before it The delay shows in the film and the handling too is regressiveThe film's theme itself is decayed and adding villainy tracks spoils it furtherDirection by Suneel Darshan is bad Music is old fashionedAkshay is just okay, Karisma is good while Amisha is ordinary" 
" why people should avoid the cinema","I think a score of 1 is a bit too high, it would mean I was mildly entertained. Does Suneel Darshan really think writing a film while on the toilet can be passed off as celluloid material.Plot- none really Bollywood movies don't need plots they have emotions instead but i'll give it my best. Akshay Kumar a up-and-coming singer (the man is nearly 40) gets a lucrative record deal. The record company is owned by an old admirer Karisma Kapoor. Karisma, Akshay and his present girlfriend, Amisha Patel were all at the same college. Akshay goes to America seals the deal sleeps with Karisma and then regrets it, now everyone is back in India and Karisma is doing a Glenn close.I don't watch Bollywood movies because there any good (with the exception of Hulchul which was very good) but for the spectacle, I expect the banal plot, awful dialogue and ridiculous minor characters but what really makes my skin crawl is the way every other line of dialogue is repeated in English. It really does have the worst dialogue, Amisha does it well in a monotone that would make a Uni- lecturer proud. Karisma swans around like Marlene Dietrich with a look in her eyes like the psychotic rabbit from Watership Down. Akshay is well Akshay, 2 dimensional prima donna who will sign on any movie contract put in front of him (check the scene where he is getting his promo photos done, I wanted to laugh but was honestly embarrassed).Spoiler-I'm not saying that a lot of research should be done for the film but a little can help, Karisma slices her wrists and dances on glass and has no injuries, not even a little scare. And a day later she's wiggling around like Marlene again.p.s. can anyone explain the last scene to me. Did they leave the body so they could all go home and get dressed in white and then call the ambulance to pick up the body and not tell the police that a gun was involved. Oh there's a lot more crap but I haven't got the time" 
" The Hit Team of Suneel Darshan and Akshay Kumar ends","Akshay Kumar and Suneel Darshan started working together with the box office hit Jaanwar and then the blockbuster Dhadhkan which despite being a love story impressed me. But, Suneel Darshan just like his brother Dharmesh Darshan came to an end and his end was a box office disaster with Akshay Kumar the actor who gave him his best films. Coming to this film, it is a messed up typical love story gone wrong and terribly editied because Darshan wanted to make some changes which ruined the movie. The movie is about three characters and yes there is a love triangle. But, Vicky(Akshay) and Anjali(Ammesha) like each other while Natasha(Karishma) likes Akshay but Akshay is only her good friend. The film follows the same old aged stupid formula and even the music doesn't save the film. But, the comedy is good and revies 20% of nonsense and makes it worth a watch. But, even this isn't good enough to save the day. Overall, another crap film and I only watched it for Akshay Kumar and I had high expectations being Karishma Kapoor's film after ages." 
" Still a Great Actress","She hasn't been seen on screen for quite a while but this movie proves she still is one of Bollywood's greatest Heroines. Amisha Patel and Akshay Khanna do their Parts good too. If you like Karisma Kapoor films this your movie to watch. You'll be amazed at how with even a short time away from Bollywood she still is graceful and still comes out at the top. This movie gives it's viewers something worthwhile to watch not just any movie that you read about a love triangle and only two people walking hand in hand off to enjoy their lives. The dialog is wonderful the songs are great to listen too. The cast is great too and so are their outfits. They outdid this movie. It may sound like an ordinary storyline but the cast make the movie superb to watch. Worth the money and time. Got to watch it." 
" Respect this movie very much","Don't know why people write angry essays or rewriting the script of the movie. This movie hits teens during the 2000s hard. Shows what Indian movies are made of, powerful and endless love. Majority of the world would of thrown her away and called her crazy, but the male actor said something like "I will let you make the decision at the end" was very respectful, but due to the ending there were many questions of "what if" or reality of life. You're wasting more time writing, must have triggered you." 
" What were these people thinking?","I mean i have seen many bollywood movies and when i was watching this i watched it with my friend and we made this film really funny but you know what was with that whole karishma wanting to commit suicide like 3 times and she was like drowning him in her blood and everyone just waited for her to finish the song and didn't stop her when they saw her feet bleeding. I mean what was that about? I think this movie was really a waste of time and the songs were really bad and crap."Mere jeevan saathi" what kind of title was that? I mean the dialogue was stupid and the screenplay was very bad and amisha patel and karishma weren't acting very well. I mean they looked so fake and those pictures of akshay kumar in that room. I mean that Chinese and hairy ones were crazy!! and creepy!" 
" The script was so bad but the actors tried to make the best of it.","Akshaye Kumar plays yet another character who becomes a pop-star (as if we didn't see enough of that in Bewafaa) and tries to get on with his new way of life with his girlfriend (played by Amisha Patel). But he is plagued by constant attacks (while in India) by the camp of the people whose record deal he refused in favour of the one that made him a star. In short, he is being stalked and attacked by a rival record company. Due to a motorcycle accident, his girlfriend is unable to go to NYC with him, on his trip there to meet record label executives and you can just imagine that he will definitely meet another girl. If you are surprised by the fact that he meets another girl, then you don't know your Bollywood flicks! This other woman comes in the manner of Karishma Kapoor in the first vamp-ish role I've ever seen her in. She plays it with such an exaggerated swagger that you can't help but laugh at some points and cry at others. She's the sort of girl who is used to getting what she wants and the type of girl you love to hate. Upon meeting Akshaye's character, she is smitten and it turns out that she had a crush on him while in college but Akshaye never knew her. She was even very instrumental in making him a star, and over the years her love has grown into a dangerous obsession which Akshaye doesn't notice until too late. Anyhow, he sleeps with her, a major "No No" especially when dealing with the psychotic unstable types (see Shallini in Raaz and Priyanka in Aitraaz). . She follows him to India and begins to make life a living hell for him, all while Amisha's character doesn't suspect a thing, which was so unrealistic. The most surprising part of the film comes at the end when Akshaye does the unthinkable and you wouldn't wonder after this, why this film was a big flop at the box office. For those of you who were shocked when in Paheli, Rani Mukherjee's character got impregnated by SRK's ghost sperm. Well, SRK and Rani have been upstage with this film because in it, Akshaye marries a corpse and that's enough said!" 
" Most craptastic movie EVER!!!","OK, there is no way you could even conceivably take this movie seriously... But for connoisseurs of truly terrible train wrecks of movies...this is the creme de la creme of craptastic films. From the across the board over the top performances, to the insane art direction (dig the bright green carpets with red walls) to the horrible costumes (could Akshay LOOK any more gay?), to the cheesy dialogues and nonsensical motivations to the songs that go on...and on....and on.... (the theme song is repeated THREEE times) ... this is one movie that you will be SCREAMING at the screen while watching in horrified disbelief! Although it's basically a ripoff of Fatal Attraction, it goes so much beyond that film into the realm of surreality. Enjoy it for all it's unbelievable horribleness..." 
" Pathetic","The movie is unbearable and horrible.This is the sickest movie in Hindi language.The diection is HORRIBLE.The screenplay is terrible.The story is a rip off.It tells about 3 people Vicky,Anajli,Natasha.They are college mates.Vicky loves Anjali,Natasha is obsessed of him.She writes a song called Mere jeevan saathi and sends it to him.She doesn't write it.Years later Vicky has his first concert he sings the song.The song is a chart buster.Two man Morani and Torani wants to kill him.Skip a long story.He goes to Angel music in USA.It is one of the best companies.He goes there to extend his tour.SHOCKINGLY he cames across Natasha.Soon he leaves for India.Natasha follows him.Anjali and Vicky are engaged.I think the movie resembles Aitraaz.Although Aitraaz was far better than this movie.Akshay looked good as always but he was wasted.Amisha is useless as usual.Karishma is only good for looking at.She is an overrated actress.I must say she looked gorgeous as ever in this movie.She overacts miserably.Gulshan and the other unknown overact a lot.The others are useless.The screenplay is horrible.The dialogs are worse.The climax is rubbish.The cinematography is UNBELIEVABLE.The costumes are good.The music is brilliant.The picturisations lyrics are superb.The leads lack chemistry.The twists are quite pathetic.Avoid at all costs Rating-1/10(Only because of the songs nothing else)"
