" This is a copy of a 1998 French film .","Bheja fry even though a good movie ... is sadly ,copied "inspired" from the 1998 French movie Dîner de cons, Le (1998). Also known as "The Dinner Game" (English title).Many scenes are exact copy "inspiration" of the French version. The difference being that the French counterpart is an artist who has a great talent of making structures using matchsticks , while as the Indian one is a no good singer, in the French version the customs officer loves football , and the Indian , Cricket. apart from these "regional" details the movie is a complete copy of the already highly acclaimed French movie . The directors and producers keep the Indian public in dark by making them think how well the story line is and what a wonderful "indigenous" movie have they made. It would have been much respectful , it they would have mentioned at least in the credits that this movie was " inspired " from the play and movie written by Francis Veber.Anyways its good to see at least they are aiming their "inspirations " not just at Hollywood movies , but also to the other foreign language movies too . Its a treat to know how well do they copy the real one but anyhow the Movie is a treat to watch and really a must watch movie , the actors and the movie staff have done their job really well. So go ahead n watch the movie .DRAGS for more info search IMDb for " The dinner Game " or go to http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0119038 and the trailer at http://movies.virginmedia.com/synopsis/default.asp?filmid=12&sec=syn" 
" A real Tasty Bheja Fry !!!!","Beginning with, I must say this movie, knit around few characters is a real winner in its own sense. No big casting, few characters and all these characters were a perfect match. The real show stealer was Vinay Pathak in the role of Bharat Bhushan. With the flavor of foolishness and innocence he cruised well along the movie, and this foolishness also brings along a hilarious range of events which is pretty enjoyable. Also Ranvir Shorey in his small role was impressive. Also the length of the movie is nearly 90 minutes which makes sure u are gripped through the entire movie. I would recommend to watch this movie with keeping your working brains aside and just NJOI !!!" 
" If you've not seen this, you've laughed less this year.","Bheja Fry is unlike any comedy film you must have seen in recent past. It has no big names in the cast, you might not have heard about the director either, promotion of the film is a low key affair... No loud comic drama, no banana slips to make you laugh, no double meaning dialogs. But still it easily qualifies for the most hilarious film of the year. It is 100 odd minutes of pure humor. The film surprises you with the unique wit and classic comedy. You might not be expecting anything from the film and might come out highly satisfied. That is the best thing about the film. This is probably the first time the comic potential of Vinay Pathak has been utilized fully. This is one actor with amazing comic timing. The characters of the film are highly believable and you can actually recall at least one person you know/have met which is similar to each character in the film. The film boasts of great acting,great situations and a very simple script. Though its an adaptation of a french film, it hardly takes the credit away from any of the actors.Watch it for sure, because if you've not seen this, you've laughed less this year." 
" Dinner Game?","I am amazed at the reception this movie gets. All you need to do is watch the French movie Le Diner De Cons (Or Dinner Game) to understand why I have given this a rating of 2. It simply is a frame-for-frame copy. I haven't seen plagiarism so blatant in a Bollywood movie. Even simple scenes like showing the doctor the bathroom, the dogs in the car, reference to phrases like nymphomaniac are straight lifts. All Sameer Bellary and his team has done is to hire translators instead of screenplay writers.Bheja Fry beats everything what people like Sanjay Gupta and Anurag Basu have done before. However, watch the French movie. Highly recommended." 
" A very different experience","This movie is quite different and handled very uniquely. The theme, storyline and everything about this movie is so refreshingly new that you are charmed by these. The entire movie is a laugh riot and the acting by the main character Bharat Bhushan ( Vinay Pathak )is just exhilarating. Others including Rajat kapoor, Milind Soman and Sarika have done very well. The movie is about the entire stretch of a night and how a man pays for his mischief that he intended to play on others. A very light hearted comedy and very enjoyable.Then why just 6 stars ? Well reading through some others reviews on this site I find that this movie is a copy of the french movie "Dinner Games" . To verify this I checked on the plot of the original and I found that indeed it is true. This requires that the director should acknowledge this fact in the titles but I don't remember having seen that in the movie titles.Well apart from this fact ( though a very embarrassing one ) the movie's direction is flawless and the story is very humorous." 
" copycat!","Welcome Sagar Bellary to the ever-burgeoning group of 'inspired' directors, whose poster-boy is Mr Sanjay Gupta(Oldb..and reservoir...ahem..Zinda and Kaante fame) Bheja Fry is a direct frame-by-frame copy of 'The Dinner Game', a rib-tickling french comedy by Francis Veber When will filmmakers start giving credit to the original movie makers? Its one thing to use a story as a framework and foundation, but here even the screenplay is copied. The sad part is people who haven't seen 'the Dinner game' hail this movie. Shame on the director and producer of 'Bheja Fry' for not acknowledging the source of this movie." 
" Excellent movie","I do not know, whether its a copy of a French movie as it is said by other people.Some people say its bad just because its a copy, but i go against those statements,because copying is not the point, the point is the good movie of French could be understood only by people who knew French but because Sagar Ballary made the movie in Hindi, a language know by many people in India, the movie could be viewed in India, and give the excitement of of the French movie in India. OK we could tell the movie was bad if the acting was bad, but actually the acting was too good.Seeing the above statement i feel the movie is a 1 time must watch since its an excellent movie and i think it was a worth watching movie since it was a simple good comedy, I do not care whether it was a French copy, I am happy that Sagar Ballary brought the movie to India." 
" Good, Funny Movie","Bheja Fry is a movie that will irritate you to laugh; perhaps a Sunday evening well spent for me laughing out to the irritant of Bharat Bhushan (Vinay Pathak). This 95 minute movie is enough to entertain you whilst you're at the Movie Hall and should not be pondered beyond that. For those looking for some serious humor, forget it and definitely not for those who always wanted an action flick nor for those who wants those French-Speaking-English-Subtitle Oscar worthy movies.The movie is about Bharat Bhushan, who was supposedly one of the scapegoats for Ranjeet Thadani's (Rajat Kapoor) Friday IDIOT' Dinner Party. Well, that is what he does, he invite budding talents to dinner on Fridays and let them sing, dance and he enjoys the fun. The table was turned and he had to bear the beyond-control-idiocy of Bharat Bhusan on a particular Friday. The situation is that of trying to make an extreme simpleton an idiot thus ruining the fun when the idiot never realizes the game. On top of that, what if he never gets angry? That is the peak of irritation mount. That's what Ranjeet faces with Bharat!It was fun to watch Bharat Bhushan right from the moment we saw him in a bus bound for Pune from Mumbai. He was good all along his stay with Rajat at his house on that day, TGIF (Thanks God its Friday). His phone calls  it is ringing to redial are funny even when you know it was coming the next time. You should watch for his phone calls to people that mess up the whole thing and in fact which is the backbone of this movie. I will keep the details of the story line for those willing to enjoy this movie."

" Bheja Fry Is A Trend Setter","A well crafted script, brilliant acting and above all, smart sense of humor make Bheja Fry a trend setter in Indian cinema. No caricature, no action, no crude humor - Bheja Fry proves that there is enough scope of fresh thoughts in Indian cinema.As already posted by others in this forum as well as by other critics, Bheja Fry is possibly an adaptation of a French film, the Dinner Game. However setting it in Indian context and establishing the characters have the their originality and that is what matters.The winner of course is Vinay Pathak for his brilliant portrayal of Bharat Bhushan. Rajat Kapoor and others just fit the characters so well. Possibly the talent of Ranvir Sheorey could be better utilized.Congratulations to Sagar Ballary, Arpita Chatterjee, Sharat Kataria, Suresh Pai and others of this great team. We look forward to many good work from them.And kudos to Sunil Doshi of Handmade Films for sponsoring Bheja Fry. And he must be happy - it is already a hit in box office." 
" Absolutely brilliant, absolutely hilarious !","Nowadays, when Indian directors can't make a decent comic flick, a new director all of a sudden comes up with this absolutely hilarious movie.The movie doesn't have even one of our so called superstars of today. All the actors are mostly into Television or stage shows. But still the movie could put even some big big budget movies to shame. Vinay Pathak is simply superb and Rajat Kapoor adds more brilliance.The best part is the impeccable timing of the dialogs because of which you end up laughing at the end of every line spoken. For almost the entire movie, neither could i stop laughing, nor could the rest of the audience in the cinema hall. This is one of the best comedies that i have ever seen. A must watch for every one." 
" Hilarious without holding an adult tag!","I first came to know about this movie was through IMDb votes. May be because of its star cast (which I respect a lot today) I was not interested. Any ways I decided to watch it because of reason I mentioned. To my surprise it turned out hilarious.It's not one of your Adult comedies which turn out extremely entertaining because of its adult factor.The show runs for about one and half hour. It is perfectly scripted and synchronized to keep you in your seat for all this time, kudos for that. The fun ride never ends; something comes up at every instance as the movie progresses.While reading some of the reviews I got to know the movie to be copy of a French film. What I think is it doesn't matter. For me it was original. To add further I encourage such originals.Acting: To act with such a script was difficult. Vinay Pathak nailed it. Ranvir Shorey was a treat to watch as well.Final Verdict: I would say I have seen such a level of humor only in adult comedies. Thus it stands in crowd. Please do watch it!" 
" A great movie","Bheja Fry is an out and out comedy movie that is very different from the vulgar comedy movies made today. It is clean humor. A must watch for every cine lover, and especially the ones who love comedy. Vinay Pathak has come of age and he should bang the best actor in a comic role award for this movie. The best comedy movie I have seen in a long long time. The good thing about this movie is that it does not create any kind of confusion, a trait on which our generation comedy movies thrive. The length of the movie is also perfect. It has not been dragged at any point. Not having any songs is also a good thing as no song would have fit into the movie. Sarika looks good but she does not have too much of a role in the movie. A complete mature movie viewer film." 
" too good.","This is really an awesome movie to watch. Story moves around mainly two characters and few supporting.All of them did an excellent job. Vinay Pathak did an excellent job hats off to him. He is a gem of an actor.. his expressions looks real. You will keep laughing till the end of the movie..and you wont find a single double meaning stuff. If you are really looking for some fun weekend. Grab your tickets... you will surely enjoy...!!! I enjoyed every bit of movie..!! Good stuff with no big star casts no songs no love story no trees to move around.. no sas bahu.. ..but surely with lots of fun..!!!! Three Cheers to the director and star Cast..!!!!" 
" absolute Drag","I am surprised at the rating this movie has gotten so far. Seems like only people who watch movies and include ratings are teen age boys and girls who would laugh at the slightest hint of stupidity.For those who like some serious entertainment, this movie is a total drag. I haven't seen the movie that this has been copied from. But if thats true than either this is a bad effort at coping (which, by the way Indian directors are very capable of)or the original was also a drag.In any case, I truly believe you can spend two hours of your life in a lot better way doing something else than watching this." 
" A great situational comedy","The name "bheja fry" didn't promise much grandeur for sure and I went to the hall expecting the worst and cursing my friend who has dragged me into this. But what came was a pleasant surprise as the 95 min. film turned out to be an enthralling rib-tickling joyride. Vinay Pathak has long been an underrated actor and he proves his calibre by delivering a powerhouse performance which lifts an otherwise average film to a comic extravaganza. Everything from his looks to his dialogue delivery was spontaneously suave and had the audience rolling with laughter. The story basically is based on one night when a Music-company owner(Rajat Kapoor) invites a "talented" singer (Pathak) for dinner and that night changes his life in many ways.Rajat Kapoor delivers a decent performance. Sarika looks fresh in a comeback role of sorts. Both Milind Soman and Ranveer Shorey does their part full justice but again Vinay Pathak stole the show. Watch it if you want to watch a good comedy........boy!! Indian cinema needs more of these."
