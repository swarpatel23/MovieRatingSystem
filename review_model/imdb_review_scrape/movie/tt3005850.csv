" One of those films, which have all workable elements but still fail miserably.","Hindi Film Industry is certainly looking for new plots to offer something fresh to its starving audience. But working on this encouraging vision, many a times, scripts get approved which do sound interesting in narration or on paper but don't really turn up as even average entertainers on the screen. SOOPER SE OOPER is also one of those shaky projects, unable to make any kind of favorable impact on the viewers in its two hours of duration.Based on an interesting plot of the hero's journey to bring his Mama (Mother's elder brother) back to Mumbai from Rajasthan to get his property's claim papers signed, the film is loaded with almost everything required to make a good project. It has Vir Das(GO GOA GONE fame) who plays the person caught between his villager relatives and a cunning builder eager to take over his property. There is Gulshan Grover playing the Oxford returned learned Mama, Yashpal Sharma as Mama's devoted follower, Deepak Dobriyal & Tinnu Anand playing the builder mafia dons, Kirti as the pretty face and the team of Sonu Nigam-Bickram Ghosh making the soundtrack of the film probably for the first time.Further SSP has a decent cinematography, fine art direction and the vision of making a clean comedy (Shekhar Ghosh), clearly visible in few of its comic scenes too. Yet, nothing works in the desired manner throughout the film and it turns out to be neither a comedy nor a complete social drama in the end. The film is never able to grab your complete attention or make you laugh as the projected comedy and even the actors seem to be losing their interests at times. Particularly it looks like quite a below average, mediocre product, watching Kirti's weird dance sequences, poorly conceived in the competition scenes. In all this is nothing you can enjoy in the theaters but may be a certain section of viewers can do so while watching it on the channels in the comfort of their homes." 
" Lower than the lowest","Director Mr. Shekhar Ghosh is the writer of this film too, so he had to be blamed for this disaster. There is not a single scene, where you can feel that it is a film. Everything is haphazard. I preferred this movie over others due to the lead man Vir Das, because he is known for some unusual and intelligent stuff but this is simply idiotic choice. This is a clear cut case of if you can arrange the money then you can make movie. If one can watch all good movie of a year only then he can easily avoid such type of incident to happen. There is no story, no screenplay. I was just praying to end the movie. Even 1 hour 50 minutes were not going easily. Performance wise even good actors like Vir Das, Deepak Dobriyal , Yashpal Sharma were unable to help the film. Music is given by Sonu Nigam but literally where was music?" 
" An Attempt Made With Multiple Mind States. â™¦ 54%","And those states are: inebriated & sober. The writers probably wrote the base & first part when they were inebriated and that is why it is good. The references they make to the land mafia, corruption and other social causes is pure intelligence. But the second part nullifies the whole point.40 minutes into the screenplay, the plot starts to bore. The characters just don;t make sense, mainly that of Gulshan Grover & Tinnu Anand. Vir Das is charming but his chemistry with the actress is just so half- baked. The humor is good and slightly obscene and that just keeps the film from drowning. With terrible editing & cinematography, Sooper Se Ooper is a lukewarm watch.BOTTOM LINE: Depends on the viewer to decide: whether they like Vir Das & his small acting stints or not.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
