" Nice Family Movie","If you go in expecting a serious movie, then you need help. It is easy to tell from trailers that it is a family/kiddie movie, nothing more. It makes you laugh a bit, has some nice songs (and some very nice music every-time that Yamraj is entering) and is not supposed to be the least bit realistic. The movie is made for the family, enjoy it that way. It's one of those where you have to leave your thinking cap at home. If you analyze it, you'll hate it. The movie is not made to be thought of like that. The trailer lets it be known that Shahid Kapoor is killed, and you can guess by the story line (and by previous reviews) that he'll go back to help his family. That's what the story is about. He has a sister, who needs to be married off. There is Amrita Rao (once again, the actress gets little scope), who loves him and was going to marry him or something. All the youngsters, who just lost their older brother. Dadi, who needs dialysis and all; and the family has no money. And the evil guys, who all want their house. It is after all this is introduced that the movie starts. Though the ending is expected, it still provides laughs. I still get kicks out of Yamraj and the music that plays in the background." 
" Cute, but no brass ring","What a really cute movie. Perfect for a Saturday afternoon with the kids. Not a serious movie, lots of cute comedy. But that's where it ends. If you're looking for a kiddie comedy, fine. But for adult entertainment - it lacks considerably. The plot is far fetched, the characters are not well developed, the special effects are chintzy, and several situations that arise in the beginning of the film are forgotten, left completely unresolved by the end. Pitiful screenplay, but the actors/actresses did okay with what they had. Even with a good cast, it's a bomb. It definitely won't help anyone's career. Watch only if you have a child/grandchild watching it with you. Otherwise you'll feel you've wasted a few hours time." 
" Gr8 movie for kids","Whos says it cant b watched once, it is movie for fun and entertainment to watch out with kids. I would rather rate it better than many movies in which a triangular love story bores u the whole span. It was a Gd experiment of the latest technology , though it was not perfect, yo mesh . I think a gr8 treat for kids and also if u find time , not a time waste at all.s i mentioned before the plot of this movie isn't ANYTHING that one would expect from a Bollywood movie,instead it is more Hollywood-ish. Some of the scenes are borrowed from American movies such as "Ghost" or "Bruce all mighty". The scenes which are borrowed do not have any comparison towards their original Hollywood versions (simply because the Hollywood ones are more superior).Shaid Kapoor gives a pretty good performance, as he realizes that he is a dead-man! which is unbelievable by him. While Sanjay Dutt, who plays Yamraj the angle of death (aka Yamraj MA), gives a very comical performance. The main plot is that Adi (shaid K) must save his family because they are going through troubled times, the only problem is that he DIES!(due to an accident)!! .. Yamraj (Sanjay D) gives him a few days to restore all his family problems to normal and then he will take him back. You see how this plot relates to "Bruce All Mighty" or more similar to "Ghost". Anyway the questions which arises is will Adi be able to restore everything to normal within his alloted time or what if he fails :( ??? ..." 
" Interesting movie--SPOILER ALERT","Worth watching for the one and only "Yamma Yamma Yamma" MA, the great Sanjay Dutt. The whole movie blows apart in the sentimental scenes but the final scene (SPOILER ALERT),where Shahid Kapoor gets to stay back in the real world becoz of Yama's predilection to reveling in drink makes him is funny to watch. Another interesting episode. Yama and his bison are replaced In this the bison is actually a jeep, very funny to watch.Also funny, is Yama's fear of losing his job. The biggest fun is when Yama comes in the final scene as Sunjay Dutt, that was simply awesome.Also, i think the movie rocked unlike the above commenter. This movie is worth watching at least once. Everyone must see it at least once in their lifetime. or they haven't seen an Indian movie actor at his best." 
" The rating is too low for this good movie.","I didn't plan to write a review. I was surprised that the rating is so low. I was going to rate it a 8, but now I am rating it a 9.Indian movies are almost always around two hours and 30 minutes. So no matter how good the movie is, it tends to lose its momentum after a while.The beginning of the movie was slow and not very interesting, but once Yamaraj showed, the movie started to get more and more interesting. At first, I thought that he will let Aditya go back to live again, I was wrong.The concept is new and refreshing unlike the typical Hollywood movies. The special effects are also entertaining. I truly enjoyed it." 
" a cHIld'S plAy!","This movie is very different from normal Bollywood movies, it is very unique. Actually this movie isn't meant for older audiences its more of a children's movie, with lots of scenes taken right from a child's imagination. If you are looking for a realistic movie, then i advise you not to watch this but if your looking for a movie which you can laugh at(considering some of the scenes are pretty funny) and just enjoy without thinking in your mind is this really possible or is that possible then this movie is meant for you! As i mentioned before the plot of this movie isn't ANYTHING that one would expect from a Bollywood movie,instead it is more Hollywood-ish. Some of the scenes are borrowed from American movies such as "Ghost" or "Bruce all mighty". The scenes which are borrowed do not have any comparison towards their original Hollywood versions (simply because the Hollywood ones are more superior).Shaid Kapoor gives a pretty good performance, as he realizes that he is a dead-man! which is unbelievable by him. While Sanjay Dutt, who plays Yamraj the angle of death (aka Yamraj MA), gives a very comical performance. The main plot is that Adi (shaid K) must save his family because they are going through troubled times, the only problem is that he DIES!(due to an accident)!! .. Yamraj (Sanjay D) gives him a few days to restore all his family problems to normal and then he will take him back. You see how this plot relates to "Bruce All Mighty" or more similar to "Ghost". Anyway the questions which arises is will Adi be able to restore everything to normal within his alloted time or what if he fails :( ??? ...This is a good entertainment movie MAINLY for a younger audience(or even for older audience as long as they know how to use their imagination!!)..." 
" don't even think about it","The movie is mind blowing. That is it blows your mind off. A terribly pathetic movie for which i have no words. Shahid Kapoor acts and talks like SRK. Each scene, pose of him will remind you of SRK, is that his tribute to SRK. huh. he is so bad at everything.The story -- mix-up of things. In the very beginning of the movie they tell the movie is gonna be nothing other than scary-go-round around Aadi (played by alarming Shahid).there is a desperate attempt in the movie to look cute with its scores of uh-huhs and oh yeas! in which they terribly fail.everything is bad about the movie -- just about everything. e1 in case someone writes to spoiler about the movie one won't be able to Reason 1) the movie is already spoiled 2) no one can survive the entire movie -- I ran out of the hall in the middle.after every scene i kept shouting - Interval - AND NOBODY IN THE HALL MINDED. but the movie breaks for interval after torturing 90-100 minutes.Yuck! why does not IMDb have -ve rankings." 
" What was Mahesh Manjaraker doing?","I like Mahesh Manjaraker's movies. Viruddh for example was so well made, I went expecting at least a decent movie. But for me this was a terrible waste of time. This movie was torturous at best.But of course, if you have liked Main Hoon Na, you probably would like this one too. There are some nice visual effects but they are used out of context. The story is confused. It has got elements copied from Sound of Music, Ghost, Bruce Almighty and also from Hindi movies like: Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke and Brahmchari. But there is no blend.Characters doing anything at times and the story going in every direction. This movie, had some interesting parts and if it was properly edited, could have saved us from a lot of torture." 
" the movie shows you the happy world which we all imagine","We all live childhood but real person is the one who even after being adult does not let his inner child and this movie is for those, the movie brings your inner child out , the movie is set in complete fictional world but a world which we all imagine where evil get punished and good people stays happy, a movie worth watching forever" 
" Film ho to Aisi","Mahesh Manjerekar was a top director with VAASTAV and KURUKSHETRA and ASTITVA and slowly he begin doing cheap filmsthis is one of his crap filmsThe film has a plot which mixes Mr.India and many more but it's handled very cheaply the villains stand out like cartoons of course even in KMG type films they do, but here the comic scenes are too childishThe film has lot of stupid scenes which are too childishforced songs plus some weird comic scenes between Sanju and Shahid and both competition in making weird faces, weird tones Mahesh is at ziltch here Music is okayVFX is okaySanjay Dutt hams in his role though he is likable in parts Shahid copies SRK in many scenes and hams it badly Amrita Rao annoys" 
" waste of time, money and energy","first of all- a total waste of time, money and energy. you can come to realize why the Indian film industry is yet so far behind Hollywood- even though the gap has been considerably bridged over the past few years. only 2 or 3 really good movies come out every year from this industry. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!!! do not see the movie even if you are given free popcorn and a free ticket. for complete degenerates. horrible acting. worse direction. pathetic special effects. endless number of flaws. bad music. no good looking girls. they even made fun of Indian mythology! how can someone make a movie so bad? please- go do something more useful." 
" Doesn't live up to the hype","Average music, average acting, not to mention an average script, and lastly, average directing. I was expecting a lot more from Sanjay Dutt, as I love his movies. Sadly, I was disappointed. The only half-decent thing is the plot. Its not a ripoff like many Bollywood movies, and has some originality to it. Note that I said some, not all.Shahid Kapur is appalling, he does a horrible job and does not fit into character at all. Amrita Rao does not do anything apart from looking pretty, and I raised my eyebrows with Arshad Warsi's performance. I like him as an actor, he has done great roles, but I don't like this one. The character was very fake.To sum it up: VLHTA is mostly a film that we will be enjoyed by kids. There isn't much point in the movie at all, its what I would call "rubbish". Even Sanjay Dutt's incredible presence could not save this movie." 
" My favorite Bollywood film","I got this movie because I am studying Hindi and I needed to practice understanding. I found it more amusing than educative. First I thought this was some Indian version of Yours, mine & Ours but later Adi's death was kind of revolting. I was like come on, this is a kid's movie for cheap sake. The guys at Bollywood can't even spare the drama from a kids movie, would it kill them to not to include death in one film??????????????????? Anyway, later I saw this as some kind of imitation of the movie Ghost. The songs were good. So this wasn't a waste of my life after all. When I saw Yamraj, I was like great soon Siva, Ganesh and the rest of the gods will show up."
