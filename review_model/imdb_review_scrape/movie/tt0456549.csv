" laugh, cry, wish for more","Great story, great comedy, great presentation, provocative, funny, and also serious. To see Antara Mali pretending to be a man in a woman's body is priceless. Her sense of the ridiculous shines throughout this wonderful addition to the slapstick genre. There is more to the film than the promised comedy, however. The exploration of the contrasts of gender psyche is serious food for thought. As an American I also loved the peek into the lighter side of Hindu spirituality and cultures. I will confess that this movie made me both laugh and cry. I wished it would not end. I can't wait to see what Ms. Mali will come up with next!" 
" So much potential, so little success","The story line isn't a new one, but it does have the potential for lots of fun and laughter. Sanjay (Aftab), is womanizing ad executive who dies but is then sent back to earth in female form, so he can experience what life is like for a woman and thereby learn the error of his evil ways. The comedic possibilities are endless, but the success most of these jokes rests on the shoulders of the gender-bending actor.Aftab and Ritesh (as best friend Ravi) are both wonderful in their respective roles, but nothing can save the film from Antara's dismal portrayal of the female Sanjay. What happened to the beautiful subtle acting we saw in "Company" and "Naach"? Antara's concept of male physicality appears to be sneering constantly and swaying from side to side like an elephant.And exactly how long does it take to learn to walk in a pair of high heels!?! The story spans almost a year and yet Antara flops and stumbles through the entire film, launching herself from doorway to chair like some sort of misguided torpedo! (She miraculously recovers her balance in order to kick butt in a bar room brawl, but has a relapse as soon as the scene is over).If you want to see this film done properly, then do yourself a favor and hunt up a copy of "Switch", the 1991 Hollywood original staring Ellen Barkin" 
" Stop Ripping Off Hollywood, and get an original idea please!","Where the heck does "Antara Mali" get off taking the writing credits for this movie when this is a rip off from a Hollywood film "Switch" (1991), starring Ellen Barkin, and Jimmy Smitts? I am personally fed up with this trying to pass off someone else's work, and original ideas as one's own that Bollywood has been indulging in for years! STOP the plagiarism, and get a clue! I am surprised that someone in Hollywood has NOT clued up and sued the pants off some of these Bollywood producers for this blatant stealing! Bollywood dares to talk of "Stopping the Piracy"! Well first start with cleaning up your OWN act!I feel very strongly about this,as the movie "Switch" was one I really enjoyed, and to see someone coming along, and trying to take the credit for writing a story which is actually the brain child of someone else is despicable. At least give credit where it's due, and be honest enough to admit that the movie is inspired by another production! There have been many movies made that have been "inspired" by some other play, movie,or book etc.If you admit it, there is no shame in it. At least it will be better than blatant plagiarism bordering on stealing. Shame on you Antara!Take a leaf off the book of an Indian movie maker like Nagesh Kukunoor who's work is original, and like he said at the IIFA Awards in Dubai this last week, "There are 1 billion Indians, and between us, we should be able to tell an original story"!" 
" Must Watch","Do not bother for reviews of this movie. It is worth a watch. A total laugh riot. Each and every expression on Antara's face depicted the real frustration of a man in woman's body. You gonna enjoy more if you feel the movie. Its a nice lesson for all those womanizers too. Ritesh is wonderful. Antara is awesome. The plot of the story is good and justifiable. The story flows pretty smooth. I watched this movie with my wife and couple of other friends. We kept on laughing most times. The climax gets a little serious, but passable. It was a treat to see Antara act in an entirely different role, not attempted by anyone else. Enjoy Watching." 
" So incredibly funny!","Okay, this is a comedy. And it's one that's been done before, so many times. You'd expect it to be stupid, simply because it's a B-list film. Hold on to your funny bone, this is hilarious! It is so well done it's almost believable! From Sanjana struggling to walk in heels to dragging (literally) her date home, it's too good to miss. The plot twists keep you guessing what's next. The end comes too soon, you've fallen in love with all the characters, and want to see where it will go in the future! I had actually bought this DVD, set it aside for a day when I had nothing else to do, and didn't think it would be that great. Now I'm glad I own it, I can watch it again and again with the family, and have lots of fun." 
" Annoying beyond words...","Aantra Mali is beyond annoying in this movie. I cannot comprehend why RGV would support movie like this, it is utter crap in terms of acting by the lead, and the direction very amateurish. The only explanation I came up with is that Mali slept with RGV for years when she was lead in his movies and this was payback. I had to turn the movie off after 35-40 minutes, just could not stand Aantra Mali, every line she spoke, she would make these weird and ugly faces with her "battisi" showing, shut that piehole and act stupid little woman. I don't understand why she would do that, that is not how Sanjay talked or walked in the beginning of the move, so who is she trying to imitate? her monkey perhaps...She was overacting beyond words, glad that she has left Bollywood for good; good riddance! Avoid at all cost!" 
" Mr ya miss don't watch","They copy HOT CHICK and ruin itAntra Mali a regular of RGV earlier directed this filmThe film has an interesting plot but pathetic executionThe start is okay and the twist is good but then nothing actually catches you laughingThe scenes go from gross to stupid Directorally Antra Mali tries hard and it shows, some scenes are well handled but mostly the film lacks the conviction Music is okayRitiesh is the saving grace, he acts well Antra Mali goes too overboard and bores Aftab is okay" 
" Antara Mali's overacting, botched rip off","The (ripped off without credit) concept is great but the execution is botched. Antara's overacting ruins most of the fun. Aftab and Riteish did a reasonably good job though the main character is Antara's and it is flawed from the beginning to the end - due to overacting and poor screenplay. It is far from either funny or redeeming; just over the top!There are better comedy movies and better executions of good concepts. For the former, there is too long a list - Hera Pheri series, Dhamaal, House Full etc. Examples of the latter include Bhaag Johnny, Oh My God etc. This movie is the best example of a botched rip-off. Frankly, it is not entertaining even if you set aside the rip-off factor completely." 
" Yet another Hollywood rehash","Miss Mali should let the original writer take the credit of this "inspired " flick. Mr. Ya Miss is a rip off of Blake Edward's "Switch" released in 1991. If you liked this movie to any degree, you will love the original.Ellen Barkin was awesome in the original. Miss Mali - as the previous reviewer mentioned, is more of an acquired taste. She is gorgeous in still photo-sessions. However, in movies must watch her expressions which have a tendency to go a bit overboard at times.The story is very different. It is payback time for a womanizer when killed by his girlfriend(s), he is sent back to earth by God to find one girl who actually loves him - the catch is that he must find another woman as a woman. Watch either versions for the story - it is hilarious and something different."
