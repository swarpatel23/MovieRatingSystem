" Going back in time","V.K. Prakash's Phir Kabhi is a dramatic feature which tells the love story of senior citizens, Hari Singh and his teen sweetheart Ganga. A recently-widowed Hari receives a letter from Ganga in which she invites him to take part in a school reunion party with all their past fellows. This sequence, although a tad clich√©d, is very nicely done and is filled with nostalgic-laden memories presented through several flashbacks into their past lives as students. There also begins a renewed relationship between Hari and Ganga. Hari is surprised to know that Ganga has never been married, and the two start exchanging letters and even meeting from time to time.Phir Kabhi's concept is rather interesting and is well presented. The script is for the most part good, and the narrative is extremely subtle. Director V.K. Prakash effectively directs the film and gives it an engaging feel, although the film has its loopholes, sadly. One example is the fact that Hari's daughter in-law disapproves of this relationship and he quietly accepts it like one of those disciplined mamma's boys. I mean, come on, why would any middle-aged man do what his daughter in-law demanded from him, and who is she to give him any orders in the first place? That was quite pathetic and unconvincing and almost ruined the entire film for me.Where the movie easily makes up for any of its flaws is in the performances. Mithun Chakraborty is excellent as Hari and he looks incredibly authentic in a role that gives him full scope to showcase his great acting skills. It's almost impossible to believe it is actually the one who played the Disco Dancer Jimmy and the action hero of so many flicks. Note the scene right after the death of his wife, when he cannot find his glasses and mistakenly calls his wife. Just see his deep devastation when he suddenly recollects that she is actually no more. Dimple Kapadia is also well cast to support Chakraborty and she delivers a restrained performance. Gulshan Grover is very good in his role, and the rest of the cast lend adequate support.Phir Kabhi is an interesting film and in spite of its flaws, does leave a mark. The performances, particularly that of Chakraborty, easily make it a watchable feature." 
" Once More...","I bought this DVD few weeks back but then wasn't too keen to watch it in a hurry because I knew to watch these kind of movies, I need to watch it with body and mind in it. In between, read the review of the movie and realized that the movie has not been ever released in any cinema halls as there were no takers.This is a love story of the senior citizens where Hari Singh (Mithun) is married for 40 years to Lakshmi (Rati Agnihotri) and is very happy with her. It is after a sudden death of his wife that he has started feeling lonely when he gets a letter from Ganga (Dimple) who was her first love. They were in love during their schools and couldn't marry because of his fear of his father. He starts exchanging letters with Ganga and even starts visiting her. But then her daughter-in-law (Kitu Gidwani) believes that this relationship will never be accepted in the society and it could set a bad example to her grown up daughter. She refuses Hari Singh to meet Ganga. But when she discusses this with her husband, she realized that Ganga is meant only for Hari Singh. Both Son and Daughter-in-Law decides to unite them.Mithun has set an example by giving one of the best performance of his career with equally strong performances by Dimple and Rati Agnihotri. Rimoh Mithun Chakraborty as the young Mithun and Neha Jhulka as Mithun's grand daughter are impressive too.I must admit that this movie is a must watch." 
" A Wonderful Film....","V K Prakash's 'Phir Kabhi' is a beautiful piece of cinema.
