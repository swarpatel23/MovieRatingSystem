" Bollywood in Sci-fi league","I am generally averse to any of the Bollywood movies inspired by Hollywood - they end up half-baked dodo's. How-ever after having watched Koi Mil Gaya I must admit that::01. Bollywood comes to technological age02. Hritik stands above the story and scriptHritik gets into the skin of the character and delivers a mind-blowing performance which patches up for the flaws in the movie and all the rant critics had about being inspired from dozens of Hollywood movies. We truly have an actor who is dedicated and perfection is his ultimate goal.Undoubted the movie is inspired from E. T, Independence Day, Forrest Gump, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and Jack but doesn't appear force-fit and nicely blend into actual storyline. It appears that Rakesh Roshan and Hritik Roshan acted as perfect reality- check for each other. Roshan's should be lauded for the risk they undertook and it has paid off indeed.As in E. T., I was expecting the alien to steal the show - but I guess Hritik proved to be strong competitor. Rekha fulfills her dream of being Hritik's mother (which she claimed at Awards shows, a few years ago!). And Rakesh Roshan must have fulfilled his dream of playing screen-father. Preity Zinta was good.Songs always have been the forte' of Rakesh Roshan movie - thanks to brother Rajesh Roshan. This time around Chitra gets a break. Dances need a special mention.SFX are okay - by Bollywood standards. And Johnny Lever needs a major overhaul - please learn a thing or two from Paresh Rawal.With stupendous success of KMG, I was expecting a trend of sci-fi movies in Bollywood but I guess the hamlet still fears to tread the path less-traveled. Rejoice - we have had a beginning..... and a good one!" 
" Koi Mil Gaya","Hello, I am white and English, and this is the first Indian film I have seen. I would not usually watch them, but chanced upon a trailer on the SONY Asian channel. I enjoyed the film so much I bought the DVD. I have never seen or heard of the actors/actresses and never seen a 'Bollywood' film, but I'm glad I saw this one, I was highly entertained all the way through. I enjoyed the cinematpgraphy, the singing and dancing was bizarre, but fun, and even though I don't understand Hindi (although now I know a few words!) They speak English enough to get the jist. I also noticed the Indian people on this film are more theatrical than white folks, their facial expressions, body language and gesturing tell a story on their own. The only faults I found were continuity and the young girl with the bobbed hair seemed to disappear from the group of kids part way through. Oh and Preitty Zinta is Divine! Good luck!" 
" Solid family entertainment","Just came back from seeing this film on opening day after waiting four months....and can say it was definitely worth the wait.  The acting is top-notch -- Rekha is wonderful as the mother, Hrithik pulls off his character with aplomb, Preity does a splendid job as the new girl in town, and Johnny Lever has never been funnier.  Even the super six do a great job! The story reworks elements from the Mahabharata into an ET-/Close Encounters-style science film story.  All the production elements are terrific:  music score, song-and-dance numbers (including a wonderful homage to Singing in the Rain), camerawork, lighting, and -- yes -- the spaceship special effects.  One particularly amazing dance sequence has Hrithik cavorting with his own shadow. An instant classic that we'll be talking about for years to come.  Congrats to all involved!" 
" The Indian version of E.T.","An Indian version of E.T.(1982) would be particularly outstandingHrithik Roshan plays an abnormal youngster who meets the alien The alien revives his mind and enhances it making him not wear glasses, jump higher than Spiderman, extra-intelligent and a superb basketball playerThis film does impress and was India's first go at the science fiction genre There are also six kids who act as Roshan's friend Roshan's father plays a cameo in this film Only Rekha could have done Roshan's role with such sympathyHrithik Roshan, Rekha and Preity Zinta leave their mark with this film Rajat Bedi is impressing as an annoyed young man who is jealous of very attraction to Zinta Prem Chopra is convincing Mukesh Rishi has done a good job Johny Lever is funny" 
" Just for fun","If you watch Koi Mil Gaya with an open mind with no expectations, it's a really good movie. It isn't made too well and has loads of glitches, but movies are made for the sake of entertainment and this entertains. There are parts where you cant stop laughing and exciting parts as well. Hrithik Roshan has acted remarkably well in this movie. Although the plot line isn't original and some parts are copied from various Hollywood movies, it is an enjoyable movie with good music (although it could have done without 'Haila Haila') and it was basically just plain fun. Worth a watch." 
" Hrithik's Back!","This is a thoroughly entertaining movie (except for the melodramatic scenes in the end) and Hrithik shines in the role of a mentally challenged boy. I have enjoyed the songs, the gravity-defying dances by Hrithik and how well Hrithik has captured the mannerisms of a mentally challenged boy. Some people might compare it to a range of Hollywood films, but let's just appreciate that a different sort of movie has been attempted and for goodness sake let's just enjoy it. This is a great family movie and a great treat presented by Rakesh Roshan." 
" Classic Mentally Challenged Indian Man Meets Alien, Sings Songs, Overcomes Local Bully, Loses Alien, Rescues Alien, Sings More, Gets Girl Story","I apologize if I seem disoriented or hysterical. I started writing this mere minutes after watching "Koi Mil Gaya." This is (apparently) the first sci-fi movie from Bollywood. The story in a nutshell is this: A young mentally handicapped man named Rohit befriends an alien that has been left behind on earth. The alien, a squat, blue, monk-ish looking creature, is named Jadoo. After Jadoo heals his brain (and pumps his muscles full of steroids apparently), Rohit competes for the affections of the beautiful Nisha with a local bully. When the local government finds out about the alien, it is up to Rohit to protect him and find a way to get him home.I got this movie on a whim at the public library. The combination of science fiction and Bollywood seemed too hilarious to pass up. Thinking I might have not checked out the DVD, and never seen it is like imagining some sad alternate reality that can only be repaired by time travel. Jadoo has become a buzzword that instantly reduces me to fits of laughter. It is an almost infinite source of puns. It has surpassed its own meaning to be a word that means anything (like smurf.) "Hey, Jadoo me a beer while you're in the kitchen." "The cat left some Jadoo in the hallway." It can be shouted in victory as you slam dunk a basketball, called out in query to a family member as you open the door, or quietly mooed as you enjoy a tasty bowl of curry flavored popcorn.Rohit – Seeing a 35 year old man playing a mentally challenged individual is already risky. Throwing Yoda-like alien into the mix doesn't bring any gravitas to the situation. When you factor in the Hindi language and songs every ten minutes, it becomes something else completely. In all fairness, Hrithik Roshan is an incredibly physical actor. He dances and emotes with an intensity that is infectious, but most American audiences are probably too jaded to take it seriously. He kind of looks like Stephen Colbert doing a bit. Sometimes his hip thrusting dance moves call to mind Martin Short.At some point you will notice that one of his hands has two thumbs. It is an unfortunate deformity that belongs to the actor. I didn't even notice it on the first viewing. Then I re-watched a scene where Nisha kisses his hand and there is a giant closeup of it. I actually screamed. We had to pause the DVD to allow for some quiet retching. They try to cover this by giving Jadoo a similar feature on his hands, as if to imply that Rohit and Jadoo are linked. It doesn't fly.Its a good thing Hollywood doesn't do the same thing as Bollywood. If they showed off your favorite celebrities deformities, you might be disturbed to find out: Daniel Craig has a massive birthmark in the shape of Lake Superior. The procedure to remove it was so invasive that he got tattoos of Michigan and Huron just so it would blend in. It is covered by makeup when he has to take his shirt off. Anne Hathaway has rectangular pupils. Martin Sheen doesn't have a back. On the other side its another chest, complete with nipples and belly button.Nisha is played by Preity Zinta. She makes up for the whole thumb issue big time. She really is a beautiful woman. Which is why you might be able to identify with Rajat Bedi, who plays her boyfriend. It is assumed, maybe even arranged that they will be married. When he finds out she is spending all her free time with Rohit, he is furious. He picks on Rohit, even beating him up. Still, that isn't anything a massive disco dance number and a basketball to the face can't solve. The special effects are primitive by American Hollywood standards. If you're the kind of person that asks "How does a UFO cast a shadow in the middle of the night?" then you may struggle through this movie. Jadoo's facial expressions are limited to blinks and lip wiggles. The actor inside the costume can't do anything to make him laugh except juggle the entire rig up and down. Darned if it doesn't make me do the same thing!One director's blatant ripoff is another's loving homage. You will see thinly veiled scenes from Spiderman (both 1 and 3), Sound of Music, Singin in the Rain, E.T., Peter Pan, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Space Jam, etc.Not only does it imitate Independence Day, it actually samples music directly from the soundtrack! There is a fair amount of product placement, but nothing approaching the level of a western blockbuster like Transformers (which was in its entirety a product placement advertisement for the Military Industrial Complex). The camera blatantly zooms in on the alien as a child gives him a coke, which his lifeless mouth can only drink through a straw. During one scene Nisha and her boyfriend visit "Cafe Nescafe." Check out the scene where Rohit and his 8 year old friends beat up a biker gang and make a narrow escape by lowering the handle bars on their razor scooters so they can pass underneath a road barrier while the gang crashes behind them.Despite any flaws, Koi Mil Gaya is a good movie. It is innocent and wears it's emotions on its sleeve. An American movie might be far more polished, but it would also be jaded, sleazier, and not nearly as fun. Go get some take-out Indian food, turn down the lights and Jadoo it." 
" Entertaining film for the entire family, but mostly for children","Koi Mil Gaya is a nice film for the entire family, but mostly for children. Not much does it offer to adults. It does not mean the film is bad or something, I really enjoyed it for being a very well-made movie, but it's just not a film anyone would want to watch twice. To its credit, this is one of the only sci-fi films made in Hindi cinema, and it has succeeded as such. It benefits from great music, effective special effects, but above all, Hrithik Roshan's extraordinary performance as a mentally disabled young man. It also has lovely appearances from other actors, including Preity Zinta's light yet great portrayal of a modern young woman who learns to communicate with Hrithik's Rohit, and Rekha's moving act of his mother who is in a daily struggle with her son's defect. But these ladies succeed because they are two actresses of great screen presence. Otherwise the film was clearly made by Rakesh Roshan for his son. I frankly get a bit angered that all three of his films starring his son did not give any notable scope to other actors but were mainly created to promote Hrithik. The film is considered to be revolutionary, while clearly it is not. We had Mr India in 1987 which was in my view better at its time. Koi Mil Gaya is similar to E.T, but frankly pales in comparison. This Jaadoo, while a sweet creature, is plastic. BTW, he can't act (just kidding!). Anyway, the film is worth watching for its innovative concept and light, endearingly childish script." 
" A step in the right direction",""Koi... Mil Gaya" is a step in the right direction for Hrithik Roshan and Bollywood in general. The former finally has found another role since "Fiza" that is worthy of his talent, a role that's neither purely fluff in a likewise fluff or worse film (AMALL,YAADEIN,MDK...) or a crass miscast (MPKDH), and the latter steps into new territory concerning suitable subjects and use of modern sfx. Both are rewarded with a superhit as a result. The film is not doing as well in UK and US as in India where it's on target to leave K3G, Devdas, Lagaan and KNPH behind. The reason is most likely that NRIs are more familiar with Hollywood films which KMG is a copy of, and stick more to mushy family/romance/love-potboilers than new Hollywood like experiments coming from the motherland. The usual description of KMG as a mix of "E.T." and "Forrest Gump" is mostly correct. The film adopts many ideas from "E.T." beyond the concept of an alien landing on earth and making friends with kids. It also borrows from several other Hollywood films. That's somewhat irritating if you are familiar with these films, but fortunately the indianisation and mixing has been done quite nicely, and there is enough material around that does not immediately ring a bell and looks fresh. Also irritating is the product placement, a necessary evil, it seems, to co-finance such a big film without banks or the Bollywood mafia. Technically the film is clearly above average for Bollywood and some of the sfx are near Hollywood quality. The alien can't compete with the original E.T.. It's too plastic and artificial for that, but it grew on me nonetheless. The wire (removal) effects in Bollywood films are usually amateurish and blatantly unrealistic. In KMG they look pretty professional, even when they are obvious (in the song "Idhar Chala") and help create a magical mood. (The song "Idhar Chala" is a little gem, by the way, an instant classic, that will surely get awards for best choreography next year.) The CGI birds look pretty fake on the other hand, and the integration of the CGI for the spaceship's landing crater is halfbaked with incorrect 3D perspective and visible seams. The performances are quite good throughout, but the film clearly belongs to Hrithik Roshan from start to finish. As a boy in a man's body he delivers a performance that can compete with good work from any actor anywhere. Award nominations galore next year are a certainty and wins hardly less. It's the kind of performance that triggers a reevaluation of what someone can and should do and it will hopefully bring him lots of good role offers beyond the stereotypical loverboy with biceps that shakes a leg before he walks into the sunset with his dulhan. KMG is quite enjoyable, not only for kids, and it will have its place in the history of Bollywood as a film that made a difference. And that is a nice achievement." 
" Good movie","Rakesh Roshan after launching Hrithik in KNPH(2000) re-launched him literally with KOI MIL GAYAA 3 years laterThe film seems inspired from ET and reminds us of FOREST GUMP, SPIDERMAN.etc but the film has strong emotional quotient which works in it's favourYou have the 90's type comedians, too much dance, some romance and a lot superficial scenes Yet the first half is full of fun, the scenes where Hrithik are bullied, all the scenes were he is in distress move you Even his scenes with Preity are good while Rekha and he too have several good scenesThe interval point introduces Jadoo here things look too fake compared to ET like him uttering crap Hindi words but you forgive such things in Hindi Movies The film does drag towards the climax and the film is ended too too fastDirection by Rakesh Roshan is the best in dramatics Music is goodHrithik lives his role to the T, in fact for most of the film you forget you're watching Hrithik but Rohit instead He is brilliant in emotions, comedy and everything This film was a turning point in his flagging career Preity too does a decent job, though there are some scenes where she does her usual annoying shouting Amongst kids Hansika is a delight, so is the Jatt guy and the others Johny is funny Mukesh Rishi is alright Prem Chopra hams as usual, Rajiv Verma is as usual too Rajat Bedi is good in his part Rekha excels, Rakesh Roshan is good in a cameo" 
" What a Tribute to true friendship","This is a film that the whole family will enjoy throughly. in fact I cried through most of the second half this film shows what true friends will do for each other they will risk all for those whom they call friends. It is in Hindi a Indian language English subtitles. I truly enjoyed this film to the maximum. in my experience the Hindi films have more of a story line then most Amercian films, and th music is mind blowing. t is a Long film so you have to have at least 3 hours to devote to movie watching. I want to say to the director Brovo I give this film a very high ten stars,*********. Please enjoy this film with the ,kids.Sincerely Sean, the Movie Guy" 
" Hooray for Bollywood","Koi...Mil Gaya proves that Indian cinema has nothing to envy any other type of cinema. Bollywood produces hundreds of films that are pleasant, if somehow naive, for the Western taste, but they are so well intentioned that who can find fault with them? Either you go and enjoy, or avoid them like the plague!This film has a little bit for everyone. Director Rakesh Roshan has crafted this film very carefully. The beauty of the region where it was filmed, is the best backdrop to this movie with the right elements to please whoever venture to the theatre to watch it.The film is greatly helped by the two stars, Hrithik Roshan and Preitty Zinta. Both are handsome performers, as well as dancers. The musical numbers are very well staged. At times they feel one is watching a musical video of an Indian song. While this film will not convert anyone to a Bollywood devotee, it's pretty enough to enjoy. Spending a steamy summer afternoon in air-conditioned surroundings taking the music and dance numbers will make you think: Yes, Hooray for Bollywood!!!!" 
" Is it a proper Sci-Fi?","Don't get me wrong...I love this film. It was a great job, and Hrithik shows some excellent acting skills... But there's where my problem with the film starts...was this meant to be a Sci-fi or just a film about Hrithik's character???This could have been a film with much more and better special effects, and much much more concentration on the ET itself rather than just on Hrithik....I lived through the 1st half of setting the scene, expecting the second half to be so much better once the alien is on screen, coz I thought we would be seeing the tackling of a subject not usually dealt with in Bollywood: aliens....And then once the alien does appear, all we are shown is Hrithik being so great, bla, bla, bla.... No mention of the alien's feelings, or how the relationship between it and Hrithik grows...The only times we see the alien is when it's helping Hrithik...I mean, maybe that is just because it's a Bollywood production, and a Bollywood production cannot NOT have a love story implying a super hero...Okay, hats off to Rakesh Roshan for having been able therefore to adapt his so called "sci-fi" to the Bollywood audience.But it's just sad that that is what the Indian audience is perceived as expecting from a film....Surely, we are ready for a film without the usual super hero and love story....or are we??" 
" The Alien","A middle class family Ranjit and Sonia live in rural India. Ranjit wants to pursue his career on studying and researching on heavenly creatures.

" Hrithik one again proves to be a superstar of Bollywood","This is an honest blockbuster film of hrithik he nailed it like a hero There were a lot of cool scenes in this epic adventure thriller movie preity was above average in her performance of her character rajat was brilliant as the villain rekha was perfect was the mother other were brilliant Jonny was hilarious as always mukesh was superb in his performance as the antagonist overall this is Marsala entertainer don't and never miss this blockbuster songs are all time blockbuster" 
" Top entertainment with tour-de-force Retard turn by Roshan","KOI MIL GAYA -- (I've found someone ...) or E.T.lands in India image1.jpegí Viewed during Bollywood film week, Budapest, Oct. 2016, starring Hritik Roshan and Preity Zinta, with a special appearance by the legendary Indian actress, Rekha. Check adult mind and critical faculties at the door. Just come in, munch on you popcorn, kick back, and EnjoOOOOy. Lots of fun for three and a half hours with plenty of cinematic tricks and trompe l'oeil. KMG is basically a science fiction fairy tale for children of all ages with no holds barred. Director Rakesh Roshan (61) has done his Hollywood homework, basing this movie squarely on Spielberg's E.T. and incorporating a dance sequence that is practically a quote from 'Singing in the Rain'. Through it all dashing Romantic star Hritik Roshan pulls off the challenging role of a retarded young man, with "a child's mind in the body of an adult" with such engaging aplomb that he won numerous Best Actor awards in 2004.Unlike the Hollywood Extra Terrestial, there is no reaching for any kind of scientific validity -- it's all done on a level that any child can understand and that is exactly the charm of this film. There are several basketball sequences where slam-dunks are executed by flying children and forget about normal hardwood reality. This is just entertainment with a capital E and was a blockbuster hit in India, mainly, I guess, for the transformation of usually dynamic handsome leading man Hritik Roshan into a mental retard -- who becomes a hero under the influence of the magical powers of our lovable cuddly blue skinned visitor from outer space. The setting for all this is what seems to be a resort mountain town with magnificent Himalayan mountain peaks against which the usual extravagant Bollywood dance numbers are set. The dancing in this film is particularly eye-catching as Hritik, once empowered by E.T. unleashes some of the amazing rubber leg moves that have made him famous as Bollywood's premiere male dancing star. Anyway, pure enjoyment from start to finish. Preity Zinta has gotten a little plump but the extra roundage has not impaired her dancing duets with Hritik one bit."
