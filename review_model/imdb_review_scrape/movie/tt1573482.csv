" A taut, gritty thriller set in the Mumbai underbelly","I had seen Chandan Arora's Mein Madhuri Dikshit banna chahti huu when it had released and I was much impressed with the simplicity with which the director had handled the story. Then came the acclaimed Mein, meri patni aur woh which again got rave reviews, but I haven't watched it yet.After Striker, I am sure, I am not going to miss any of his movies. The movie has a great ensemble of young & emerging as well as some veteran actors who all flawlessly do justice to their respective characters. The cinematography is superb and takes the audience right inside Mumbai's darkest alleys! The dialogues are delightfully crisp and witty. These are the factors which carries the film forward and even manages to cover up the (very few) glitches in the storyline...If I have to dig for some complaints, it would be the background score, which fails to use the beautiful songs in the soundtrack to the fullest extent, the second love story which was a little too "convenient", and a script which kind of loses track in the second half. But none of these in anyway affect the end product to a great extent. Some audience may even fail to notice them! Siddarth plays protagonist, Surya and is overwhelming as the confident, blessed carrom player. He exudes charm as the boy next door where it's required and is just brilliant when he has to emote in the final few scenes of the movie.While the other actors - Vidya Malvade, Pancholi (as the menacing local goon), Anupam Kher, Seema Biswas are all great in portraying their roles, it is Ankur Vikal (Slumdog Millionaire's Baban), playing Surya's best friend Zaid who steals the show. He plays the ever enthusiastic drug dealer to the best and even manages to overshadow Siddarth's performance is some scenes.Watch Striker for the performances and realism with which the movie carries itself. Highly recommended!" 
" Do not give it a miss.","Its December 1992 and curfew time in Malvani, Mumbai's north western suburb when Suryakant Sarang aka Surya (Siddharth) arrives back in Mumbai from an out of town trip. Communal riots have broken out in the area mostly dominated by Muslims.Surya is stopped by the police, headed by local in charge Faroukh (Anupam Kher). But Surya is restless after he comes to know his family members have fallen prey to the riots.From hereon the narrative alternates between the flash back and current scenario mode.It narrates the tale of how Surya, a lower middle class boy, the youngest of the three siblings rises to become an ace carrom champion in the carrom betting syndicate headed by spearheaded by Jalil (Pancholi).Surya and Jalil keep crossing paths as Jalil desperately wants him to play under him. But Surya nurses a childhood grudge against him. Making matters more complicated is Surya's childhood buddy Zaid (Ankur) who is working under Zaid.Editor turned director Chandan Arora (Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hun, Main, Meri Patni Aur Who) has always narrated character based tales and this time with through the eyes of an extremely well written central character he has showcased a never before exposed on Indian screen, the betting underbelly.The carrom game sequences are fantastically shot what with real carrom champs used. Making them more entertaining is the sledging running commentary by the bystanders.Vijay Maurya and Pankaj Saraswat's dialogues are sufficiently spicy. The camera-work enhances the edgy mood of the film. Sound design is excellent too.Songs are not lip synced and don't act as speed breakers but carry the story forward. In fact even Siddharth has sung a song in the film.Siddharth is nothing short of excellent in the film. Exhibiting a cute boyish charm he is very real and vulnerable at the same time. His splendid carrom playing skills are in full display in the film.Aditya Pancholi with amazing screen presence exudes scare whenever he appears on screen. Ankur Vikal is perfectly cast as Siddharth's druggie best friend.Vidya Malvade gets few scenes but she manages to leave an impression. Playing a fisherwoman running the local dingy bar, newcomer Padmapriya resembling Tabu is wonderful and is extremely expressive.Anup Soni, Anupam Kher and Seema Biswas are good as usual. Nicolette as Siddharth's first crush is good too.Chandan Arora's Striker works for the fact that it actually narrates a never seen before story as also for its authentic setting and excellent acting. Do not give it a miss." 
" Caram Mate","Chandan Arora who had previously given some delightful slice-of-life movies like 'Main Meri Patni Aur Woh' and 'Main Manjhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon' comes up with something slightly different and perhaps darker called 'Striker'. His first two films had dark undertones but on there was plenty of light and funny moments to maintain a balance.That said, 'Striker' is not a depressing movie devoid of humour. It draws plenty of laughs mostly with dark humour and some-not-so-dark humour. The movie is mostly seen from protagonist Surya's perspective. Arora's presentation of life in the slums, the struggles of Surya and his family, the little happy moments, the vulnerability of the people is brilliant. He also touches on the theme of religious clash but never preaches. One of key theme of the movie is the underground betting market which has rarely been so elaborately depicted in any Hindi film before. Surya is a master caram player but he refuses to be lured into the gambling world and only succumbs when circumstances force him.The writing is first rate. The characterization is brilliant. I liked how the Surya character was written as a strong, determined and independent young man who chooses his own path refusing to let anyone lure him into doing things. Whatever he does, he does on his own term. The rest of the characters, including the minor ones, are also well developed. The tasteful dialogues are witty and funny. The steady pacing of the story and its development is splendid.'Striker' is exceptionally well shot. The sound effects and cinematography are remarkable. Note caram match sequences are shot, creating an excellent fusion of tension and suspense. The look of the slum is also captured authentically. The songs are effectively used in the background.Siddharth outstandingly leads the film. He displays Surya's charm, vulnerability and determination with ease. He also appears to be very skilled in caram which only adds to his natural performance. Just as phenomenal is Aditya Pancholi as the menacing Jaleel. Ankur Vikal does a good job as the messed up friend. Vidya Malvade and Padmapriya leave a mark with small but significant roles. Anup Soni, Nicolette Bird and Seema Biswas are efficient. Anupam Kher is adequate.'Striker' is one of the most refreshing films of recent times, one that engages, involves and provokes. Chandan Arora has done it again and this time with something different. This guy should make more movies." 
" Only the game is new here and rest is all the same.","Multiplex culture has opened new avenues for many talented film makers, who have great ideas in their minds, waiting to be executed on the screen within a smartly planned budget. It's a welcome trend for sure, but sadly very seldom we get to see a thoroughly enjoyable flick in this particular genre, wherein a director successfully is able to transform an interesting idea on paper into an equally interesting movie on the celluloid.Chandan Arora's 'Striker' also falls in the same category in which the subject of an exceptional carom player seems to be far more exciting than the actual final product in the theaters. The story of a young unemployed boy, who is great at playing carom and wants to go to Dubai to earn a lot more, had surely got some box office potential in it. But the end product completely fails to win over the viewers mainly due to its repetitive scenes and too lengthy narration. To be straight, the game is new and the treatment is right but a lousy script with many unwanted angles and subplots simply turns a potential good movie into a below average one. Unexpectedly, 'Striker' keeps hanging between different story plots, taking the viewers attention away from its novel concept of a carom gambling racket. Deliberate insertion of 1992 communal riots of Mumbai, further ruin the movie, which otherwise could have been much better if the director had kept his focus on the game and its gamble alone. The movie starts off well with the story moving around characters living in the slums and its small illegal clubs. But soon with the introduction of more undeveloped characters on the screen, it loses its way completely. For instance the love angle in the first half finishes off just like that and never returns back, the 1992 riots come into the narration from no-where without any specific purpose to fulfill and the lady owner of a small hotel is added in the script only to provide a little eroticism on the screen. Moreover the time span of the movie which keeps shifting between flashbacks of few years, also becomes confusing for a while.The casting too, forcibly involves few well known faces of Bollywood, who are there only to add some more commercial value to the project. Like, Anupam Kher has nothing great to do in the movie as a Police Officer and his part could have easily given to a lesser known actor. Vidya Maldave does not look like a poor young girl living in the slums. Seema Biswas is completely wasted in a tiny role. Anoop Soni as the elder brother performs a similar act close to his ongoing T.V serials and Aditya Pancholi plays the bad man exactly like he did a few years back.However there still exists a shining silver line in the black clouds which is represented by the brilliant performances by both Sidhharth as Surya and Ankur Vikal as Zaid. Siddharth delivers a fine natural act, but also gets caught doing it over the top in a few scenes. As Surya he surely gives a competent performance on the lines of his "Rang De Basanti". But the real act comes from Ankur Vikal, who is simply superb in the role of Zaid, Sidhaarth's childhood friend. After few initial scenes he quietly goes on impressing the viewers with his brief dialogues and comes out as a clear winner of them all. The songs are just fine as they don't become an obstacle in the movie but background score catches your attention more. Cinematography is great capturing the slum ambiance in the right way. Actually editing is the main culprit here, resulting in a 2 hour (still) lengthy movie with many repetitive and seen before sequences in the story. In reality the game of Carom lacks the nail biting essence of an electrifying sport. Therefore it becomes a little boring after the few initial scenes and as a result hampers the beauty of an otherwise new sport on the screen.To sum up, Chandan Arora, thought of a good subject which did have a novelty value associated with the game of carom and its gambling clubs. He certainly excels in the few sequences depicting the conflict in the life of young unemployed boy. But with a spineless script in hand, he could not turn the novel subject into a great movie for his viewers. Personally I enjoyed his earlier projects a lot more than his latest one." 
" A good,meaningful movie with exceptional performances","Striker is based in Malvani a suburb in Mumbai and depicts the life of Surya, an excellent carom player belonging to middle class Indian family. The story revolves around Mumbai riots of 1992 and moves back and forth in time. The story captures the betting in carom games by a local goon Jaleel played by Aditya Pancholi. Surya is a common young boy and aspires to go to Dubai and make some quick bucks so that monetary pressure on his elder brother Chandra(Anup Soni) is relieved but he gets duped and loses money. In order to recover that money he starts playing carom for money and then gets indulged in some scam with his friend Zaid. The movie has very good screenplay and dialogues are brilliant. Siddarth portrays his character with absolute conviction and traits of a good actor are truly visible in him. Besides him all actors have played their roles to perfection with special mention of Vidya Malvade and Anup Soni. Music is other good point in this film and Cham Cham by Sonu Nigam is high point. Do watch this movie for a meaningful cinema and especially the movie relates to a common Indian at many levels and the Director Chandan Arora has done a brilliant job and given an awesome treatment to the movie. Watch the movie for exceptional performances and exciting story" 
" Playing carrom in the tough slums of Malvani","Striker is the story of a Marathi boy growing in the rough slums of Malvani under the shadow of the Islamic mafia.Chandrakant,a good looking young man grows up playing carrom in the clubs of Malvani --- a slum area of Bombay ---as Mumbai was known at that time........much of the film is in flashback mode.Of course ,the key to playing carrom is the ability to hit the disks accurately with the STRIKER.........AND Chandrakant knows how to do this with deadly effect.The Muslim don who controls malvani ,Jaleel Bhai ( played by Aditya Pancholi )wants him to play for his clubs by betting money on him ,but Chandrakant refuses the temptation.But he is in bad company of his wayward Muslim friend Zahid .......who lures him to the don's clubs.But Zahid's murder prompts Chandu to break free from the don's influence......until the two are destined to confront each other in the post Babri riots.....The life ,and the dangers and pitfalls of growing up in a typical slum area of Mumbai are certainly shown well in the film.The atmosphere of the slum is authentically picturised.The end is a bit disappointing though ,as it comes too fast.But Ankur Vikal truly shines in the role of Chandu's friend Zahid , which he has played with rare spontaneity .All in all ,a watchable film."
