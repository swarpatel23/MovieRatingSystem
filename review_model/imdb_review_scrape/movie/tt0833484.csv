" rubbish excuse for a film","This movie, is an awful, awful, awful version of the original with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. The Plot is more or less copied word to word with very little originality. The movie lacks any kind of suspense and emotion. Although Irfan Khan may have played commendable roles in the past, his negative character in this film has very little believability. He might as well have been out buying his groceries and became irate at the service with the supermarket and decide to kill a few people on his way home in anger. Thats how believable he was. Tom Cruise's character was very dark. As for the taxi drivers role, Jamie Foxx played a character that had issues in his personal life when Tom Cruise sat in his Cab. Tom Cruise forced him to confront some of these issues and in turn brought out more of his character. Hashmi's character had nothing. He was an ordinary taxi driver with no real background story and could easily have been played by anyone. As for Kothari's role, she was just there to add the usual bit of glamour. Again no real character as Jada Pinkette played. For those of you who can sit there and claim that this is a better version....my guess is, you know very little about film. Personally i think that the producers could have made this a better film by changing Irfan to either Manoj Bajpai or even the Big B. Even then, judging by its originality, i doubt it would have been a great movie." 
" A Blatant copy of collateral!","why why why? is all I can ask Bollywood for producing this crap. I'm managing to give it two stars because the normally good Irfan Khan does his best to add some zest to the role of ruthless assassin made so popular by Tom Cruise. Too Bad Emran Hashmi can't back him up with the kind of fire power Jamie Fox brought to the original film as the unlucky Taxi driver who gets to chauffeur THE KILLER around town doing his dirty deeds. The minute Hashmi's girlfriend played by Nisha Kothari in the Jada Pinkett Smith role, steps on the screen, it all goes to hell. It's just too bad that unlike Pinkett Smith, Kothari or the director (whichever) chose to make her a stripper (unlike in the original movie where I believe the character was a self respecting lawyer) and we get treated to a barrage of Unsexy Smutty Slutty dance numbers featuring the up and coming actress as she professes her scantiness and lust for Hashmi's character. Hashmi is already known for his serial kisses and Bollywood notoriety, but Kothari who is a relatively new actress should watch herself, if she hopes to have a lasting career in the film industry. With the way she presents herself here, she is most likely to be downgraded to the role of serial slutty item girl very soon. She's not much of a looker either, so I just can't understand why she chooses to market herself this way. Emran tries his best to imitate an Oscar winner, while Irfan acts like the good actor he has always been. Too bad it had to be in a bad rip off of a good film!" 
" This is a good Movie","This is really a good movie, you definitely won't be bored watching this movie. It is a thriller but it also has comic moments. Emraan Hashmi acted good and Nisha Kothari wasn't in the movie that much. The movie is interesting. Irfan Khan and Emraan are in a taxi for the night and Irfan is the killer and Emraan is a taxi driver. Irfan is on a mission to kill 5 witnesses of a underworld don, he rents Emraans taxi for the entire night and goes to five different place to kill the witnesses. Emraan finds out that Irfan is the killer after the second kill.He is forced to drive for Irfan and has no other choice. Its a good movie once you see it!!" 
" Excellent Movie!!","This is an excellent copy of Collateral. Actually, much better than the American version. I almost did not see the movie, but once I started watching I could not turn it off. The acting and the dialogues are excellent. Emraan does a great job as a taxi driver and Irfan is again the bad guy playing the role of the hired killer. Nisha Kothari does a decent job of providing glamour in the movie. The location, Dubai is also a good location for the movie. The negatives are the acting of the police team. The three main police actors seems to be hired out of a low-budget movie. This is a good thriller which is hard to find in Indian movie market." 
" Collateral copy","Bhatts have made their career ripping Hollywood films, THE KILLER was a remake of COLLATERAL in fact an almost copy paste. The film starst like an average film with romance and comedy but since Irrfan is introduced, it's well handled, though some scenes are too overdone. The scenes between Irrfan and Emraan are well handled no doubt, though it's almost ripped off from Collateral. The climax however reminds us of SADAK and is dissimilar to the original and lets you down. The cops shown in a funny way goes against the filmDirection by Raksha and Hussnain is decent though the movie is copied Music is good, Teri Yaadon Mein, Dil Ko are good songs Emraan Hashmi in those days was a decent actor who mostly got typecast in his serial kisser roles, after a subtle act in Gangster, here he tends to overdo in some comic scenes but does a good job in second half when his character gets serious, his scenes with Irrfan are good and his scene with Zakir is terrific. Irrfan Khan is simply delightful, in a role which Tom Cruise did in original, he is superb. Nisha/Priyanka Kothari is average, Zakir Hussain is good in one scene he has, rest are okay" 
" No matter how good a copy, its a copy, never watch a copy","This movie is really a copy of another English movie. People in India must really be ashamed that they cannot have original content. No matter how good the copy is, it still is a copy. Watch it only if you have never ever seen an English movie in the past.Twist to the plot, I doubt it. The musician singing in the restaurant being asked a question... Why don't you just resell DVD's of the original movie? The censor board should make it compulsory to mention on the DVD cover and the beginning credits that the movie is a total copy and should be watched only if you haven't watched the original movie.Are Aamir Khan, ManiRatnam and Nagesh Kukkoonoor the only people in India who can come up with something original?" 
" A Total Ripoff Of The Movie "Collateral," But Ends Up Being Better","This movie is basically the movie "Collateral" except with a few twists and a slightly better plot. Literarly most of the scenes are directly copied from Collateral, though I won't spoil which ones. Great movie otherwise. The hit-man in this movie can walk circles around Tom Cruise any day in terms of acting and style. Usually Bollywood misses the mark when it rips of American movies (at least for the American audience), but this time the end result turned out even better. This movie has plenty of action, some typical Bollywood dancing (only three instances) and the hit-man even sings in one scene. If you liked Collateral, or even if you didn't definitely see this." 
" very nice remake","I really enjoyed this movie every scene is worth watching even though every scene is cleanly copied from collateral it has its unique style of Indian blend so if this the idea was Indian well people would say it is an original Indian movie it is a very decent remake of collateral most Indian movies aren't very good remakes usually when they are based upon American movies and now for the acting emraan hashmi is a little goofy even though he does a good job i have to say for irfan khan his character is actually portrayed even more deadly than collateral's tom cruise and he has done a very good seemingly because his character is more developed than that of emraan hashmi overall 8/10 is the rating i give it because it establishes its own unique style on the movie being a remake." 
" Better than collateral","I don't like copies but me and my family could not stop watching this once we starting watching. Collateral is good, but Collateral's ending was cheesy. This one shows all assassination scenes. The dialogue is better and some good songs."
