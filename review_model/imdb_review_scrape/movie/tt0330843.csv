" all round pleaser","With Mani Rathnam and A R Rehman linked to a project, one cannot be in to much doubt that if nothing else the music is going to be mind blowing.
But that was not the case with Saathiya. It not only had mind-blowing music and score it was one of the best movies of 2002. The music and the respective picturisations are excellent, especially in the case of the title song Saathiya'. My other favorite song is the tongue in cheek song Choori  pe Choori'. However all the other songs are very pleasurable as well. The main question was how would first time director Shaad Ali perform on this story, that would be a remake of Mani Rathnam South-Indian movie be as good as the original?  Would he produce an art movie piece as his father (Muzaffar Ali) has done with movies like Umrao Jaan, or would he deliver a commercial piece? What one can be sure of is that Shaad has taken the craftsman of his fathers art movies and put them to commercial use, and delivered a movie that is unique, professional, modern and outstanding.The acting is excellent as is the story line. Having liked Rani from Ghulam to K3G, is wonderful to see her finally taking the lead in a role that does her justice. Her realistic portrayal of Suhani, a modern genre women dealing with the trials and tribulations of married life is excellent. Having not seen anything of Viveks before, is was a surprise to see an actor of his young caliber holding such presence on screen, that it overshadowed SRK. It is evident that this actor will reach high strides in his coming career.
For a change this movie actually delivers a subconscious message, something not commonly done in bollywood movies. The message is lifes to short, tell those around you how much they really mean to you'.  Taking this to heart, I can truly say that I loved Saathiya." 
" Fantastic Film","Yes, the film is almost like any other hindi film and yes its unbelievable how far better it is, than any of its contenders. A fabulous love story of a boy and a girl who marry each other against the wishes of their parents and society, 'Saathiya' shows the human side of love, stressing on the problems human beings deal with and work through in order to maintain a relationship.The songs are amazing and their picturization magnificent. The movie has good doses of fun, emotion and tragedy. Rani Mukherjee looks ravishing and will take your breath away, she almost looks and acts like the perfect wife for any young man. Vivek Oberoi, who is very clearly the find of 2002 as far as the Hindi Film industry is concerned, turns in another great performance, he is absolutely flawless in the film, portraying the many emotional facets of his character 'Aditya Sehgal', with an almost unrecognizable ease. Shaad Ali puts in a fantastic effort for his first film, picking the perfect actors with the perfect locales to create a near perfect film. I cannot yet comment on the replayability of this film as I have only seen it once, but it is almost a surity that the movie would be as good on the second watch. A 10/10 film, and a must watch." 
" Wonderful depiction of life before and after marriage.","Shaad Ali's Saathiya is one of the best films of 2002. Everything about it -- from the story line, the cinematography, locations, emotions, performances to A.R. Rahman's beautiful soundtrack -- makes it a worthy film. The film marks the directorial debut of Shaad Ali, and it shows he has not gone far from his father (the great Muzaffar Ali) in terms of talent and imagination. He extracts good performances from his actors, he has a sense and understanding of emotion and clearly has a knack for capturing the complexity of marriage and relationships, which are infused with impressive lifelike sensibility in this film. Basically the story's success boils down to the fact that Ali portrays it with authenticity. This is a fantastic directorial debut (although he would ruin that image in his future projects BAB and JBJ). Rani Mukherjee is the main highlight of the show, the soul of the entire film. This is her career-best performance. She is simply flawless in every single scene - beautiful, vibrant, natural and convincing. Vivek Oberoi is a talented actor and acts very well, though he is not as good as his female costar. He does have to work on the more emotional expressions, but otherwise gives a complete performance. Gulzar and A.R. Rahman give life to the film with a superb list of songs, each of which is a gem. My favourite songs include "Saathiya", "Aye Udi Udi", "Chhalka Chhalka Re", "Chupke Se" and "O Humdum Soniyo Re". To sum it up, Saathiya is a very impressive, entertaining and realistic picture on relationships and marriage. I highly recommend you to see it." 
" Powerful, Moving, and Important Love Story","This film -- which I had heard almost nothing about before seeing it -- turned out to be a powerful, moving, and important love story.  Rani Mukherjee's performance as Suhani -- the young M.D. and wife struggling to reach out to her husband after they elope -- is top notch and clearly deserving of an Oscar.  Likewise, Vivek Oberoi does a wonderful job portraying her husband Aditya as he oscillates between playfulness and workaholism.  Ali and Rathnam's story is superb -- combining drama and social commentary in a complex and satisfying tapestry.  As always, Anil Mehta does a fabulous job lensing the story -- his cinematography captures a wide range of urban landscapes that subtly adds depth and context to the story (and be on the lookout for an in-joke concerning his name in the film).  And, of course, A. R. Rahman's score is terrific -- particularly when pouring out of a theater's surround-sound system!  Not to be missed!" 
" A romantic movie with a soft realistic tone to it!!!","Saathiya, a movie that i wanted to see because of its beautiful songs. I never expected that the story would be as enjoyable as the songs. This movie is made as simple as they could and yet made it look nice without any huge sets, or without of having characters in the story who are like supposely equivalent to Bill Gates. This is a movie which most of the people could relate to especially considering most of the indian population living in india lives through middle class values which is addressed in the movie. The romance is not overexaggerated. Basically, talking about the movie a viewer would not be disappointed. The direction was very veteran like considering it was Shaad Ali's first film. He did a fabulous job at the climax point. To bring out the performances worthy of awards and praises from the leading actors, Vivek Oberoi and Rani Mukherjee. Rani Mukherjee has done her part better then her male counterpart but I would not dare take anything away from Vivek Oberoi. Vivek lends a good support but it is clear that movie's driving force was Rani Mukherjee, movie belonged to Rani Mukherjee arguably her best performance ever till date. Overall, it is a good heartwarming experience with good tunes to hummm in isolation. Characters will easily relate to you, it is that beautifully played out." 
" Good film...","Very simple love story, but shown in an angle that makes it interesting and definitely worth watching. And it has great music. The singers and musci director, AR Rehman, all do a great job. The choreography is also great. Most of the songs are well-placed in the film...probably apart from the Chori Pe chori one. It's got the high quality you would expect from Yash Raj, and the sweet simplicity of Mani Ratnam... Definitely worth a watch." 
" SAATHIYA OR ALAI PAYUTHEY?","Remakes, remakes and remakes. Some from Hollywood and some from South India. And the results at the box-office are mostly the same. FLOP! But why? Because these remakes can't achieve the status of the original versions (although good story, good performances or good music). Therefore directors are remaking their own films in Hindi but are failing, as well, because there is too much South Indian touch (Nayak  Mudhalvan; Rehna Tere Dil Main  Minnale; Dil Hi Dil Mein  Kadhal Dhinam; Doli Sajake Rakhna  Aniathiypravu etc.). Saathiya, a Mani Ratnam creation, is a great movie. The film's strength is that it is suitable to North Indian milieu but fails to reach the quality that `Alai Payuthey' spread. So where is its weakness then? Vivek Oberoi? Certainly not! It's a difficult job to top Madhavan's great performance in `Alai Payuthey'. Vivek won where Madhavan failed. Rani Mukherji then? She portrayed her character, Suhani Sharma, completely different as her counterpart Shalini did in the original version. Both were great and for me difficult to say who was the better one. So A.R. Rahman? He was the one who gave the wonderful scent to `Alai Payuthey' which you won't forget so easily. The songs and the background score which is filled with soulful tunes are absolutely great. It's one of Rahman's best works and he knows that he can't top it. As a result he didn't bring too many new songs which would destroy his early work. His new songs are nice to hear and fit to the North Indian milieu. The orchestra in the climax where Vivek apologizes to Rani is absolutely mind-blowing. Gulzar then? I must admit that I don't understand Hindi and not much Tamil (thanks to English-subtitling) but the songs have good meanings and are as good as Vairamuthu's work for `Alai Payuthey'. Perhaps Shah Rukh Khan and Tabu? Shah Rukh Khan is fantastic in his 10 minutes and portrayed the role differently as Arwind Swamy did. Tabu is unfortunately not as good as Khushboo who has done a superb job in Tamil. But where is then the problem? It's certainly unfair to compare a youngster's work like Shaad Ali's with that one of a genius like Mani Ratnam's. Ali's direction is very good and is the best debutant director since Farhan Akhtar for Dil Chahta Hai. But small scenes which might be unnecessary are missing to achieve a very good quality. For example, in Saathiya `Aditya' has no one whom he can tell all his sorrows and lands up as a depressed husband. `Karthik' in Alai Payuthey talks with his Malayalee neighbour/houseowner (in Hindi Tinnu Anand) about love, marriage etc. and gets new hopes to set a new beginning in his marriage. The climax also in Tamil which has a more realistic look is better than in Hindi which is too filmy despite Vivek's performance and Rahman's orchestra.  A clear parallel between Shah Rukh Khan/Tabu and Vivek Oberoi/Rani Mukherji could not been attained, as well.But Ali has given the film a more youthful look than Mr Ratnam has done (more hanging out with friends, parties etc.) and like mentioned before, a suitable film to North Indian audiences and it is a film that is worth watching (though not as good as `Alai Payuthey'). Alai Payuthey 9.5/10; Saathiya 8.5/10" 
" What an absolutely wonderful film!","When you come across a film like first-time director, Shaad Ali's offering, `Saathiya', you want to stand up and cheer.  Now, Shaad Ali is the son of Muzaffar Ali who made the exquisite 1981 film `Umrao Jaan', so perhaps his sensibilities and instincts were genetically acquired!  Amidst the dreck that is churned out relentlessly by the world's movie industries, a `Saathiya' is that rarity: a simple film, devoid of pretension, that quietly goes about its business and disarms the viewer with its honesty and intensity.  `Saathiya', which translates into `partner', deals with every aspect of the partnership involved in marriage.As the film opens, a young man, blissed out on the music from his earphones, weaves his way through the heavy Mumbai (formerly Bombay) traffic on his motorcycle.  He is on his way to the train station to meet his wife, who commutes to her job as a pediatrician in the city.  When she isn't on the first train, or the next one, or the next, we watch him, as the night wears on, go from mildly irritated to anxious to completely distraught.
Inter-cut with the scenes of his harried efforts to track her whereabouts, is the story of how they met, how he wooed her, their marriage and evolving, perhaps crumbling, relationship.  Through the flashbacks you get to know them, and with rising apprehension, witness his frustration and fear at not being able to find out what has happened to her.  Has she left him?  Was she abducted?  Is she lying wounded or, worse, dead, in some ditch?
As the film takes you back two years, you see him-young, brash, immature, but essentially good-hearted-meet the young woman for the first time. This first encounter takes place at a friend's wedding, where she snubs him. She is brainy, sensible, focused on her studies, and wants no part of a silly romance.  Now this is nothing new: countless movies have begun in this manner, but where it takes you and how their story is told, is where this one differs from the rest.
The film worked for me on every level.  That it is mesmerizing should come as no surprise: the screenplay is by Mani Ratnam, while the dialogue is by Gulzar.  These masters take the commonplace and turn it into pure gold. With such superior writing, the characters spring into vivid, recognizable life, and give the director and actors so much to work with.  The writers have kept everything grounded in a solid, everyday reality: the different social milieus from which the leads come are familiar to all of us.  The young man is spoilt and comes from an upper middle-class family.  But, his father's affluence is believable-he is a successful lawyer-in the manner of the everyday world.  There is not a trace of `Devdas'-like excess in this film.  The young woman's father is a railway employee, and they live in the railway staff housing.  Her family, too, in their simple, unglamorous routines, is credible in the way of millions of people are the world over. At the only meeting between the two sets of parents, the lawyer carps that it was difficult to find the other man's house because all the dwellings in the area look alike.  The girl's father takes no offence at this; he merely tells the lawyer that that's how the other half lives.  Unfortunately, it's downhill from there: the visit ends with an impasse.  The parents actively dislike each other, and an alliance between the two families looks unlikely.
Once their backgrounds are established in quick, broad strokes, we get down to the business of seeing the lead characters evolve.  His ardour melts her resolve; they encounter resistance from their parents, they elope and set up house on their own.  We watch them go from young, hopeful lovers to stressed-out, bickering married people.  Life in the big city is not easy, as they find out, and neither is marriage.  `Poor dears, come join the club!' you think, as they take faltering, tentative steps toward adulthood. Just like the rest of us, they are trying to muddle through.  You root for them and get genuinely caught up in their lives.The young leads are perfect.  Rani Mukherjee has always struck me as an actress with potential.  Though most of her films only require her to look good, something she accomplishes with ease, she has impressed in films like `Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' and Kamalahasan's self-indulgent yet brilliant-in-patches `Hey Ram'.  Rani fleshes out the character of Suhani Sharma beautifully and makes her someone you care about deeply.  Likewise, the new actor Vivek Oberoi, invests his character Aditya with poignancy and great feeling.  Though Aditya is callow, even silly, you see his passion; despite his posturing, you glimpse his insecurities and vulnerability. This young man is a fine new addition to the ranks of Indian actors.  The supporting cast does not have much to do, as the film focuses entirely on the lead pair, but Sandhya Mridul, as Suhani's older sister, Dina, is quite lovely.  Tanuja, who plays Suhani's mother, perhaps defines what is meant by the term `working actor': someone who takes an acting gig to either pay the bills, keep busy, or just wishes to be involved in any way at all with a quality project.  I'm hoping that it's for the last reason that she took this job.  The part offers no scope for her talent and could have been played by an actress of far lesser skills.  Sharat Saxena, who plays Suhani's father, has come a long way from the inconsequential thuggish roles he played in the eighties, and displays an unexpected gravitas (and a full head of silver hair!) here.At the risk of sounding sacrilegious, I'd like to say that this was a film that could have been made without songs.  It needed no embellishment, and the songs don't further the story or offer any expository detail.  Having said that, A. R. Rahman's music is pretty and a couple of the songs linger in the memory.  I recall a quote from either Gulzar or Javed Akhtar that A. R. Rahman is the only contemporary film composer who is not daunted by lyrics in blank verse.  May his tribe increase!  Gulzar's lyrics, as usual, are sublime, so I suppose it's good that songs were included.  I can barely believe my luck that within a 24-hour period, I saw TWO excellent films: `Saathiya' and the Pedro Almodovar gem `Talk To Her'.  This does not happen often, you can be sure!" 
" THE BEST MOVIE","This is the best movie ever! Don't miss out on it! Vivek Oberoi and Rani Mukherjee have done SUPERB EXCELLENT acting!! The story, its not really very special or unique but the way Vivek and Rani have acted, it seems even better. So if you haven't seen it yet, go see it right now. This isn't something to be missed!!!!!!!!!!!" 
" Composer Rahman and director Shaad Ali Take Saathiya to Great Heights","I saw Saathiya on December 20 at Naz8 Cinemas and again on December 25 at the same venue.I liked it even more the second time and intend to see it many more times on the big screen before I finally own the original DVD of the movie. Vivek Oberoi is a talent to watch.After his triumph in Company, he is superb here.Rani Mukerji as Suhani will greatly increase her fan following with this movie. A.R. Rahman and Anil Mehta who were also part of last year's Lagaan are once again magnificent. Shah Rukh Khan and Tabu make brief appearances in guest roles, but they leave an impact and make a great pair.Someone should cast them together in lead roles in a great future movie.Gulzar's dialogues are the best he has ever written. His lyrics may not be outstanding but serve the score well. Above all Shaad Ali in his first directorial effort has surpassed many veterans. His is the most assured debut since Farhan Akhtar's in Dil Chahta Hai.2002 will be remembered for two movies: Devdas and Saathiya." 
" Remake or original, Saathiya is mindblowing","The pre-release hype was huge, the soundtrack became the second best-selling soundtrack of 2002, and to add, it had names such as AR Rehman (music director), Gulzar (lyricst), and two actors with a huge fan following, Rani Mukherjee and Vivek Oberoi.The film opened with an average opening in India, UK, and the USA, because it was released alongside the much-delayed star studded Kaante. Then, slowly and gradually, the films collections picked up, and the film managed to gross Rs. 15 crores in India, £288,004 in Great Britain, and $324,111 in America, becoming a hit.Suhani and Aditya meet at a local wedding. Weeks later, Suhani moves to Mumbai to become a doctor. Aditya meets her at the train station, trying to woo her, but she won't give in. After Aditya's father disrespects Suhani's parents while coming for the alliance and Suhani going to training do they get married secretly. At Dina's (Suhani's sister) alliance, it breaks of Suhani's marriage, and the couple are kicked out of their houses, and move in with each other. Soon, their personalities clash, and an accident almost changes their lives drastically.Vivek Oberoi delivers his third great performance (following Company and Road), which is amazing for a newcomer. He emotes so well, and has a great passion in his eyes. Rani Mukherjee gives it her all, and steals your heart. She's proved herself as a true actress here.The music is amazing. All the picturisations are upto mark. The title track is best in audio and film, while other great songs 'Naina Milake', 'Chhalka Chhalka Re', and 'Chupke Se' stay with you. 'Aye Udi Udi's picturisation is perfect, and demonstrates the "shows and characters" they give each other in the bedroom!If there is any fool: whether they are South Asian, Indo-Caribbean, gori, kali, Chinese, Arab, PLEASE SEE THIS FILM! We can all learn to live life, and stop all these small problems. Because when someone you love almost passes away or does pass away, everything doesn't matter anymore.10 out of 10" 
" A cute & touching love story","A great directorial debut by Shaad Ali, and what can I say about the young Vivek Oberoi!!! He has bettered himself in every following movie. He is the future star to watch. Days of Hrithik Roshan (the dancing monkey as I like to call him) are long gone and forgotten. All great actors have said that the best way to act is not to act at all. Let yourself show through your character. And Vivek personifies this principle to perfection. He is a genuine actor. No boastful muscles, and no exceptional dancing skills, yet so effective. The key is his originality. He knows his limits, and doesn't try very hard to be the character that he is playing - in one word - effortless. He is the kind of guy you and I can relate to - typical desi neighborhood boy.This movie will make you laugh, make you cry, and keep you glued to the screen. Music is excellent and songs seem appropriate to the occasions where they appear. Script is entertaining, realistic, and very tightly written. The movie is packed with genuine performances. Except Satish Shah, whose character wasn't given much leverage, all others leave an impact. Rani has done a wonderful job, and looks very sweet, as always - chubby & adorable. Direction is spotless. Shaad has done an excellent job keeping the film story from deviating off the theme.Overall, a good entertainer. This one is going into my DVD collection. Oh yes, Sir! By all means!" 
" A Simple movie","The movie is basically above two people who love each other and marry against parents' wishes. But soon after getting married, marital problems creep in and soon both Oberoi and Mukherjee think they have made a big mistake. Watch the movie to see what ensues." 
" Excellent direction, outstanding cinematography,great acting=Great Movie","Yesterday I went to see saathiya at theatre and let me tell you that it is a great movie. Debutant director Shaad Ali has done a great job in directing this movie. Ashok Mehta's cinematography is just too good. Vivek Oberoi has done an excellent job. He shows a lot of acting skills. I personally feel that he is a very promising actor. Rani Mukherjee also acted very well. Among other actors I think Sandhya Mridul acted very well and Tanuja was just natural. The only thing I didn't like the movie was its ending. The ending was too filmy. My Rating - 9.5/10" 
" Top Film","I have just seen SAATHIYA, and I never new that I could be so gripped by a Bollywood type movie. I was loving almost every minute.EXCELLENT.I just wish I could find love like that. Gave me a lump in my throat when I thought Suhani was going to die. Rani Mukherjee ( Suhani ) is gorgeous,and boy can she dance.I hope I can get it on DVD. I gave it 9 and not 10 because I did not like the hospital part. When Suhani crosses the road and gets run over by the van I could not believe what I just saw. HOW did they do that. Looks very real. The film is very colourful. The dancing gets you jumping about in your seat. Lovely to watch good looking women dance together.Everybody needs to see this film if only to make us all realise how ugly it is to argue and be grumpy in life." 
" Bekkar ka Drama","All same old stuff...love love and hell lot of songs.. Pata nahi kab sudhrenge yeh loooooog.. Now a days all the love stories are the remake of the movies from south india."
