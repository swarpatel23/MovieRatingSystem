" Entertaining film.","Sure, some people might not like it. Since, from the posters and promo, it does not really tell a person what the movie is really about. It just says Mere Dad Ki Maruti. (My dad's Maruti car). You don't get an idea about what the movie is going to be about. Similarly, when I had seen the poster, I wasn't really moved by it, to go see the film. I went because of Ram Kapoor. He is a talented veteran actor and one of my favourites.I wanted to watch Jolly LLB instead of MDKM, but went for it. I am so glad I did. Every penny's worth, this movie. I might have liked it even more, because I am a Punjabi and I could relate to the whole film so much. Loved the wedding background to the film's story, loved the cast, loved the acting, loved the dialogues. I am so glad, it was a CLEAN, FUN, FAMILY ENTERTAINER. We do need those once in a while to watch. Liked that there wasn't any kisses or anything, or cheap dialogues, unlike other comedy films that come out which rely on cheap slapstick humour to do well and gain audience's attention.It was light-hearted fun and boy did it entertain. I won't hesitate to go again and watch it. I even suggested this film to everyone I know. It is a must watch, at least once. If you are a Punjabi, you just have to watch it. The whole cinema was laughing and through out the film, people were laughing. The film talks about how youngsters make mistakes and how to get over that mistake, we grow up in the process. It is a good comedy with a message attached. Do not expect too much from this film, but it will entertain you.The best part about the film, is the soundtrack. THIS IS ONE FILM WHICH HAS AMAZING SONGS. All of the songs in the film rock. From Haay, Mai Senti Hoon, to Hip Hip Huraah (the really catchy item song) - to even the title track. It is a rocking soundtrack, which is deffo car playable material." 
" An underrated entertainer","If you liked "Khosla ka Ghosla", you would surely love this family entertainer. I missed this movie when it was in the theaters but saw it at my friends place. Its a classic Shakespearean plot where everything is a mess until the climax. Acting all around was commendable and everybody portrayed their part as the role demanded. Special mention- The lead lady "Rhea" may seem to be a bit challenged in acting but when you think more you will realise that she portrayed the "bimbo beauty" role pretty well and that demanded such expressions initially but her character grew as the film proceeds. Frankly speaking, this movie was sure must watch with friends in the cinemas but i missed that opportunity." 
" Once again an enjoyable light comedy made around the 'Punjabi Wedding' theme.","Taking its clues from "Dude, Where's My Car?" (2000), MERE DAD KI MARUTI manages to convince you mainly due to its interesting theme which actually doesn't revolve around a loving couple but a Maruti Car which gets lost incidentally by the young boy on his date. Now how he deals with the problem & his angry father, along with his childhood buddy and girlfriend becomes the basic premise of this light comedy which keeps your interest alive right till the end. Here I would like to mention that its not a perfect film at all with many illogical instances in its script, like replacing a brand new car with the other ones without any doubts being raised on its looks, an abandoned vehicle hitting a road side tree not being reported or found by police for a whole day and many other major events shown in its one day storyline which are actually not possible within that time frame.But luckily all these questionable logical deductions just take the back seat once its likable key characters make an impression and you start enjoying their journey ahead in an exciting mode. Putting it differently the film starts in the usual manner where in the boy & girl are introduced with a song and some comical moments. In the first few scenes, you just feel that the boys are actually doing it over the top with the efforts showing on the screen very clearly. Even Ram Kapoor seems to be having trouble with the mixed Hindi-Punjabi dialogues in his opening scene and the actor even tends to go the hamming way too, playing the angry father. However as the film progresses it makes you forget all these initial hiccups and the first half majorly works due to its light comic feel, fresh new lingo, the gorgeous girl, many well written funny dialogues and Ram Kapoor indeed.Post interval, it drops a little with Ram going off the screen for a while and new entrants coming into the scene ranging from Haryanvi Car rental owners, a don like dealer of stolen cars and the Cops on their usual patrolling. Yet both the director & the writer, thankfully never lose their track and keep the narration tight with the witty one liners coming one after another to give you a good time. But unfortunately within this fabulous flow they also throw a sequence which could have been avoided as it does take the Punjabi Community for granted and crosses the limit of decency with a sick attitude.The sequence is of an extremely suggestive dance performance, wherein the bride herself is dancing in front of her groom and all the invited guests in the party, with the moves which can put even the Bar dancers to shame. Now if this is how the makers were willing to portray the North Indian people and their wedding ceremonies, then Sorry their research was quite silly and incomplete. In reality the shameful dance number has just been added into the film to bring some more giggles in the theater and nothing else, which in turn displays the lack of taste and vision in its executors. Moving ahead, another major reason why MERE DAD KI MARUTI successfully wins your heart in the end lies in its completely unpredictable climax wherein each member of the cast contributes his or her bit very beautifully. And when a film has a great entertaining conclusion then the viewers are bound to praise it unanimously with smiles on their faces, while coming out of the theaters. So from that angle, director Ashima Chibber has surely delivered a decent winner here, particularly for the north belt of the country undoubtedly. The songs have been used very intelligently in smaller versions or in the background without hurting the pace of the film. And the compositions by Sachin Gupta have also got the much needed energy in them like in songs like "Punjabiyan Di Battery" and more played in the backdrop. The film has been shot well, benefitting the young girl Rhea in particular but the continuity in some scenes was not taken care of (like the beard of the groom in his scenes).In the performance department, MDKM makes you remember two faces the most and they are of Ram Kapoor, playing the father and the charming Rhea Chakraborty, playing the leading lady of the film very confidently. Ram Kapoor successfully manages to impress the viewers largely despite of being loud and visibly uncomfortable in his few scenes (due to the language) and Rhea looks smoking hot as they call her in the film itself. Both Saqib Saleem and Prabal Punjabi as the two friends, find their perfect timing on screen with Prabal scoring a little more because of his hilarious one liners. Ravi Kissen truly excels as the Bhai whereas Karan Mehra (groom) and Benazir Shaikh (bride) play it fine.In all, MERE DAD KI MARUTI is no doubt a hugely likable film for some selected regions of the country and abroad. It has its own minus points which also includes the 'At Your Face' publicity campaign of the brand MARUTI and its various makes, continuing throughout the film without any hesitation as if they have secretly produced the film as sleeping partners.Anyway, ignoring this direct BRAND Promotion, even though the film does revolve around the same old Punjabi wedding theme seen several times before, do watch MERE DAD KI MARUTI as it still has got the content to give you a good time in the theater along with your whole family." 
" A decent watch","A 90 minute film about an Boy who lost his dad maruti Car which was meant to be for his Sister wedding Gift. There isn't much in story,most of the laugh comes from the punjabi language and flavour this film holds. The funniest scenes are between the Dad ram kapoor and Son Saqib Salem,the daughter dancing scene and scenes between saqib and his friend Gattu played by veer das look alike Prabal punjabi. The songs are decent,The whole Ravi kishen storyline added was Bad and probably wasn't needed. It is an decent watch,which can you watch with your friends,nothing special or extraordinary about it. It doesn't stand out as any laugh out loud funny movie. OK for one time watch." 
" A Decent Entertainer!","Ashima Chibber's 'Mere Dad Ki Maruti' is A Decent Entertainer! A Goofy, Harmless film, that needs to be viewed with limited expectations. 'Mere Dad Ki Maruti' Synopsis: A reckless son loses his eccentric dad's Maruti, only to create problems for himself. 'Mere Dad Ki Maruti' has rib-tickling moments, which, truly, do the trick. The Screenplay is fairly entertaining & its crisp, it never drags. Ashima Chibber's Direction is youthful. Cinematography & Editing are average. Music by Sachin Gupta is appropriate.Performance-Wise: Saqib Saleem does a decent job. Ram Kapoor is splendid. He plays the eccentric dad with great energy & enthusiasm. Prabal Panjabi is terrific. He contributes enormously in the narrative & takes away the best scenes as well. Rhea Chakraborty is alright. She needs proper grooming. Ravi Kishan stands out in a brief role. On the whole, 'Mere Dad Ki Maruti' is harmless & crisp."

Saqib Saleem,Ram Kapoor." 
" Enjoyable!","The movie is more than what the poster or the title suggests. Mere Dad Ki Maruti is a Punjabi styled, comedy drama which focuses on comedy of errors rather than logical out-mapping.Lead character is still raw & needs to draw more out of himself if he wants to stay in Bollywood. The VJ turned actor Rhea over-acted and shows how cuties fail to impress in reel. But her hotness and panache compensates for it. Ram Kapoor seems to have continued his role of 'Student Of The Year,' while the supporting cast is average. Ravi Kisan was wasted.Storyline is pretty straightforward and after the interval, everything goes the usual predictable way but thank God, there is absence of cheap humor. If you carry your logical thinking for the sequences, then you may turn disappointed as the romance factor truly hits the divider with vague impact on the story as a whole. Performances are novice while the soundtrack truly boasts of a Punjabi dash. That sounded good. Songs are repetitive and plagiarized giving much emphasis to gaudy melodies...BOTTOM LINE: The climax is truly the best scene of this movie. Although it is all predictable, but certain things made me laugh and I felt good. One time watch! But, if you hate Punjabi big fat weddings and drama related to it, then you should ignore this nice try.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: No | Sex, Nudity or Foreplay: No | Alcohol: Mediocre | Violence: No | Vulgarity: No" 
" Dil kardaa ni mera, barekaan laun nu...","A movie with a pretty different comic paradigm. More enjoyable for audience who likes crazy situations and people making them crazier by their idiotic actions. A simple family and friendship drama, with dialogues creating the most of the humor and Punjabi music at its best. Acting not to be expected beyond average, rather worse in some scenes. Saqib Salim looks perfectly like the normal carefree guy which was required by the script as the lead character. Rhea Chakraborthy, quite convincing as the blonde yet glamorous girl(the director took notice that it's the only thing she'll fit into). Ram Kapoor's fine, but not a lot of expectations met for Ravi Kishan fans. Not rolling on the floor laughter, yet a constant smile maintained till the end. If you enjoy simple, senseless comedy you can relate yourself to, it's a must watch for you." 
" Entertaining family film","Considering the current scenario of Hindi comedy films which have sleazy dialogues, gay jokes and bad taste humor, MDKM is a clean family entertainer (with gr8 music) from the Yashraj films and that's a blessing !!In spite of a thin plot, the movie is a roller coaster fun ride and the writers and director keep you glued till the end. Wait for a good twist at the end.The performances are brilliant lead by the lead Saqib and the supporting roles played by Ram Kapoor (father), Prabal Panjabi (best friend) and Rhea (girl friend). Also watch out for the eccentric dance number 'Hip Hip Hurray' which will leave u in splits." 
" A ride with a good mileage!!!","The movie is fresh and entertaining but it is just about a Punjabi Family & a Maruti car. It lacks good music (my personal opinion) but that's all OK except the title song "Mere Dad Ki Maruti". Anyone would like this film for sure. It has its moments and all the actors were seemed committed to their performances. It has funny coincidences all around. If you haven't been to a Punjabi Wedding like I haven't then this could be your chance :D Overall its a great film to watch with family and friends and don't forget to keep some snacks. For 90 min. or so forget your sorrows and feel relaxed. Moral - Park your car SAFE ha ha" 
" Disappoints","It had all the makings of "Band Bajaa Baraat", sadly it has too too many ingredients cramming into. The pace of the proceedings, the layers and the number of sub-plots fused into the narrative makes the comedy turns into confusion. Seriously the director should have first built the premise on a track or two and layered it as you go along. Saqib Saleem attempts hard and to a certain extent makes himself noticeable. Otherwise a poor man's "Ranveer Singh".Rhea is loud with zero acting abilities. A few of her costumes is atrocious.Ram Kapoor is over-the-top. His character should have been fleshed out before getting into the ranting spree at every available opportunity.Ravi Kishan stands out with his dialogue delivery and performance.The writing on the wall is clear, the production house has fabricated the Mika-Honey Singh controversy just to garner publicity. Nonetheless a few tracks stand out. Save your money to watch it on when aired on telly anytime soon and you have nothing more productive to do.PS: And yes too much Punjabi in the movie can be a sore thumb." 
" Totally Disappointed","Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge built the high hopes for this movie. And this movie perfectly ruined all the expectations. If I do not had high hopes for this film then I would have been said that it was a pretty average movie.In My Opinion :1. Script of the movie ------------------------------- Two out of Ten. 2. Comedy of the movie ------------------------------ Five out of Ten. 3. Acting of the movie ----------------------------- Seven out of Ten. 4. Song of the movie -------------------------------- Four out of Ten. 5. Twist of the movie------------------------------- Zero out of Ten. 6. Love of the movie --------------------------------- Two out of Ten. 7. Emotion of the movie ----------------------------- Five out of Ten. 8. Screen Play of the movie ------------------------- Five out of Ten. That is pretty much all of it. If you practically have nothing to do then you can watch this film :)" 
" Very likable and feel-good entertainer. Must watch","20th Centuary is quickly evolving as promising decade with so many upcoming directors whose films are made on shoe-string budget yet is light-heart entertainer. Mere Dad ki Maruti falls into this category. Beautifully shot in the city of Chandigarh imbibed by Punjabi culture, Mere Dad ki Maruti delivers wholesome fun-filled ride with routine song-dance.Sameer wants to impress his girlfriend and takes her out for a joyride in the brand new car, supposed to be gifted his brother-in-law by his father Tej. In the nick of time , he accidentally looses the car. Sameer must eventually discover the vehicle before his father blast him.New time director , Ashima Chibber does a fine job in creating a hell of a ride as Sameer finds different ways to save himself. This film will be more enjoyable if you are from North India as you can relate well with the culture and language. Screenplay will make sure you sit tight throughout the film and laugh until you cry out. Editing could have been further trimmed by cutting down unnecessary songs. Cinematography is excellent. Dialogues are funny though sometimes difficult to understand ( sometimes hardcore Punjabi). Performances by Saqeeb Salim and Ram Kapoor drives the whole film. Their chemistry as father son is amazing and will surely go down well with audience. The actor who played friend of Sameer was also impressive.Overall , very likable and feel-good entertainer. Must watch . Good 3/5" 
" Nice entertaining film","It's comedy good for time pass. Acting is good and you will never get bored at any moment. Must watch it atleast once. It's a family movie." 
" It deserves junkyard","Score 2/10 This film is full of illogical and boring stuff. A person lost his car and rather than trying hard to find it , he tries some other difficult things to compensate the loss. He is very frightened to his dad, and he is just between the chaos, his girlfriend calls to meet and he prefers to meet her without s thinking about the main problem and dad. What type of person he is? He belongs to a well established family but hell bound to solve a materialistic problem. He is even ready to buy a stolen stuff. Lost car is in the same city but he never tries to roam around the city for his car. Love track is fully Faltu. Literally nothing creative and enjoyable stuff in this film. Only the sentence spoken by Ram Kapoor in climax is good. Performance wise Ram Kapoor is fine. Saqib Saleem (as Sameer) is OK. Prabal Panjabi (As Gattu) is noticeable. Musically two tracks are good." 
" Average fare","Yashraj opened a new company Y Films, their first production Mujhse Fraandship Karoge(2011) was lauded and also worked well at the B.O. Now they return with both the leads in this film alongwith talented Ram Kapoor. The film is made for the youth and the concept is interesting. But the film stands on a skeletal plot, there are several interesting scenes but you have to understand and like that type of humour, thankfully it doesn't cross limits of vulgarity. The film also thankfully isn't too lengthy just like MFK it's length is 1:30 minutes and hence boredom doesn't set it but some times the film does get a bit strecthed.Also for those who don't like such comedy and consider it b grade then it won't workDirection by Ashima is good Music is superbAmongst actors Ram Kapoor mostly seen in small roles nowdays in Hindi films like Hazaaron Khwashein Aisi, Ek Main Aur Ek Tu, Agent Vinod, SOTY and his superb role in UDAAN is superb as the loud Punjabi father. Saqib Saleem is superb again after MFK, Prabal Panjabi who also was seen in MFK is superb too, both compliment well Rhea Chakraborthy as Jazleen annoys with her over attitude Ravi Kissan is superb in his role, rest are all okay"
