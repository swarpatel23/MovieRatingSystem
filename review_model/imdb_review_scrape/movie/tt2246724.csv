" A pretty fine effort","i saw ghanchakkar today.and,i must tell you that the movie is much diff from that you could have imagined after watching the trailer.it's basically a dark comedy.maybe,on the lines of Tarantino movies.the movie almost proves that some Indian directors of today have guts to make serious-realistic-methodical type movies with notable actors.of course,it must be difficult for the makers as because still there is not a decent market for such movies.we know movies like gangs of wasseypur,shanghai,kaminey etc have not been commercially very successful although they deserved to.so,one cannot blame filmmakers any more for making 1 dimensional mainstream typical commercial flicks because there seems to be a market for such movies forever.even i love watching decent commercial flicks like ashiqui 2 etc.so it depends on the viewers how they perceive movies like ghanchakkar.if it's a decent hit,it will be a big boost for directors who wanna make unorthodox-contemporary indie flicks." 
" Open Ended Movie","No director has done it before. Indians cannot accept it. We want or rather crave for closures and this is exactly what this movie is missing.We are a society who has to be spoon fed. We cannot marry up the knowledge to reach a conclusion. Someone has to do it for us.An open ended movie is never going to do well.For me this movie was awesome. I liked every bit of it. The plot, the scenarios, the situations and the acting. Well written and well executed comedy.I think Vidya Balan is criticized for her role but I think she was completely honest with her role. She did exactly and precisely what director wanted her to. Her character was who loved her husband and exploring fashion.Very creative story but not cut out for Indian audience as they are not familiar with amnesia or similar disease." 
" Excellenttttttttttt","Finally a good movie after weeks of boredom. Engages you from very first seen and keeps you on the edge till end.You will definitely laugh out loudly throughout the robbery scene. as the mysteries unfold your head will keep revolving. what to believe and what not, thats the question?A really clean and simple thriller. no overdose of characters. no over dose of acting.just the right amount of 'forgetfulness'.If you watch the movies to 'Enjoy' them, watch it. you will enjoy the acting, the plot, humor, comedy, simplicity and shortness of the story.Have fun." 
" A quirky suspenseful comedy !","Ghanchakkar is a refreshing comedy revolving around a laid back criminal Sanju (Emran Hashmi) and his "fashionable" wife Neetu (Vidya Balan).The film begins with the uneventful life of Sanju having to deal with his wife's bland food and his mother's doting phone-calls. Living a passive life and having somewhat given up his criminal days as a safe opening expert, he takes on a bank robbery job with Neetu cleverly pushing him into the decision.Enter two seemingly unlikely scheming bandits Pandit and Idris the played superbly by Rajesh Sharma and Nimit Das who create the 'master plan'. The heist itself is brilliantly hilarious - Utpal Dutt's mask still cracks me up. After the successful robbery they decide to stay low for three months and forcefully give Sanju the responsibility of safekeeping the money.Three months pass....and Sanju has lost his memory of the robbery...or has he? What ensues is determining who is scheming who! The film does lose its steam in some parts and would have done with some more threads but to the director's credit he still manages to keep the suspense and doesn't dumb the film down. Add to that Hashmi's poker face,which doesn't give much away, adding to the intrigue. Vidya Balan is also quite good as the dominating Punjabi wife.The final act is surprisingly good for a Hindi film and keeps a few threads still open, leaving the viewer to interpret it in his own way. Overall a good effort, I certainly would recommend this unconventional comedy." 
" Seriously Under-rated","This movie is not as bad as its reviews are. In fact, it very refreshing comedy/thriller. I think audience and critics didn't take it in its spirit or its ahead of its time. Any person can enjoy it at any time.Story is very well written. There are no big loopholes in it. Director has done a great job. Though plot was very small but they spread it very well over 2 hours. Acting wise, Emraan has done a great job. I am and never was a great fan of his acting skills but he proved in this movie that he is great actor and you will love watching him. Vidya is miss-cast in my view. Though she is great actor but I think makers of this movie picked her because of her success streak. Otherwise a pure Punjabi actress would do much better job and brought more reality, particular culture and ascent in this role. Even Juhi Chawal despite her age was better choice than Vidya.All in all, its a must watch. Its little bit experimental film but its very easy to digest. One thing I'll must say that it will glue you to your seat till the end though you might feel little boring at some instances. But you'll not regret watching it." 
" Enjoyable Comedy With Scars Of Tomfoolery. ♦ 65%","Ten minutes into screenplay, you are annoyed with Vidya Balan's diction. Thirty minutes into screenplay, you are blown away by the script. Suspense mounts, and you want to finish the remaining 90 minutes in a flash. That is how Ghanchakkar gathers its viewers.Emraan Hashmi is great with his portrayal while Vidya Balan troubled me a little. Her demeanor looked over-smart. The supporting cast is average, most of the time trying & failing to make us laugh. But, the plot is enough to keep us hooked.It seems illogical at first and you may start guessing hell of a lot of ideas on what happened & what happens next, but the epiphany is truly enduring & clever. With a slow-paced second half, it makes us yawn for a while, but the climax will blow it off. The makers have meticulously written the play and that is why it is recommended. 6.5/10.Music & songs are average, editing is good & overall, quite a funny film which doesn't use large amounts of vulgarity.BOTTOM LINE: A comic experience that should be considered. Recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity: Strong | Vulgarity/Sex: Mild | Nudity: No | Drugs/Smoking: No | Alcohol: Mild | Violence: Strong | Gore: Mediocre" 
" formulaic predictability, but overall a good effort.","Ghanchakkar by Rajkumar Gupta is an attempt to dive into fairly uncharted waters in Bollywood. Examples of Black Comedy humor from the past few years in Bollywood include good attempts like Delhi Belly, Saat Khoon Maaf and Gali Gali Mein Chor Hai. Depicting serious events like running away with the loot from the bad guys in a manner where the mob moves in with you is done rather humorously. An accomplished and renowned criminal well versed with safe breaking and combinations who has pulled off possibly the biggest heist in his life meets with an accident and looses all memory of recent events. He forgets about the loot, he forgets about the heist and of course forgets that the mob is about to come after him. In typical caper fashion Ghanchakkar chronicles the events of the mob encouraging our protagonist to remember where he's hidden the money. From the occasional beatings, to coaxing and to even visiting medicinal babas they look for an answer from a man with short term memory loss. Emraan Hashmi as the poker faced Sanju Atre plays the role of the pivotal "victim of circumstances" in black comedies. An Interesting change for Emraan as he switches to a nascent genre. From the Limca book of records "kissing champ" to challenging roles like in Shanghai and Ek Thi Dayaan, Emraan Hashmi has impressed me as an actor who doesn't hesitate with experimenting outside of his comfort zone. Along with his Punjaban better half Neetu Atre (Vidya Balan) they make the most imperfect and volatile couple. As a dark comedy would demand Vidya doesn't play the typical worship your husband coy wife but a loud Punjabi head of the household who would beat gangsters with a broom to protect her husband. Her food may need a few tea spoons of salt but her subscription to Vogue, Cosmo and Femina are up to date. I thought Vidya and Emraan complimented each other well as the eccentric couple to set the tone for a rather delightful black comedy.Emraan's accomplices in the bank heist are "Pandit" (Namit Das) and "Idris" (Rajesh Sharma). They return 3 months later to collect their share of the loot to only get frustrated by a man with a continuously changing story. Is he lying or has he really lost his memory? They give him a week to return the loot or threaten dire consequences. Almost like a boy rummaging through his grandparents suitcase for his present, Emraan tries to piece together the puzzle as to where he could have possibly left the loot. With his Travolta inspired pony tail look he plays the perfect lead in this black comedy. A man who shifts through a myriad of emotions from being calm, collected, humorous, frustrated, confused to what eventually boils down to an emotional outburst of anger. He questions his actions, the intentions of his wife and whether he has been conned out of the money since his memory loss. A lot of satire kicks in to the film such as Emraan's attempt to appease his fashionista wife by wearing a bright red branded nightsuit with a polka dotted top and pajamas as a sense of style and fashion, brandishing a fork like a musketeer when confronted by dreaded mobsters, to receiving a call from his mother during a gun fight with regards to the whereabouts of his loot. After seeing her husband bruised, punched and injured would you expect a house wife to take on armed mobsters, beating them with a broom stick till they apologize profusely for their behavior. Well this is clearly where comedy and woe can co-exist in a film like Ghanchakkar. The way I would sum up Ghanchakkar is formulaic predictability, but overall a good effort. Over the years we have been subjected to many a landmark black comedy whether highly English like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or trendsetting like Reservoir Dogs. A gloomy crime setting with unusual characters that culminates in a fast paced artless gunfight. As a dark comedy Ghanchakkar satires and goes through the motions with a minority of twists and turns, something I wish they had run with. Rajkumar Gupta has played it safe by using the exact same model here like a horse with blinders. He hasn't ventured even the most slightest outside the box. The lazy pace is commendable owing to the nature of the characters. The characters are intentionally not well rounded enough for you to get too engrossed as black satire simply brings pre-existing flaws and contradictions into a harsher light. The method in the madness of dark comedy is showcased from living with gangsters, parodies and references of old classic Bollywood films as a reference for emotion to a mystery man revealing himself in the end aboard a train.I would say all in all Ghanchakkar is a noble effort in cinema and story telling on Rajkumar Gupta's part. No standout performances with regards to acting but each character has played their part to make a good wholesome black comedy as is the case with most of them even in the west. Thoroughly enjoyed the theme song "Ghanchakkar Babu" and that little illustration in the start, Story telling through little details." 
" An interesting premise leading to such a devastating ending...","GHANCHAKKAR is a comedy/thriller directed by Raj Kumar Gupta, starring Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Balan.The film revolves around Sanjay Atre, who receives a call to join two people; Pandit and Idris to steal a bank. Being a small time thief, he decides to end his career with this one last job worth 350,000. After pulling it, Pandit and Idris decide to keep the money Sanjay and only after three months, they will collect their respective shares of the loot. The only problem is that Sanjay has partially lost his memory due to an accident, and doesn't quite remember where he kept the money, but we don't even know if he's telling the truth, or just conning everyone.Alright, the trailer of Ghanchakkar left me awaitng its release due to its premise and star cast. When the film released, I booked my ticket to see the film and it didn't quite live up to the hype I had created.So let's start off with the plot of the film. From what I've written above, the plot seemed solid, yet when executed into a 2hr15m, the movie sinks.I'm going to be honest with you; THIS FILM IS A DARK COMEDY. Yes, the trailer betrays you. Pandit and Idris are seen more comical in the trailer, but are much crazier in the film. And this movie isn't quite funny. Except for a few forced laughs here and there, it tries to keep you gripped to the plot. But we can never do that, due to the fact that no entertainment on-screen tends to bore a person. Inspite of the movie being quite alright, the film's BIGGEST flaw is the end. It is SUCH a letdown. I could have thought of tons of ways to make it better. After realizing the movie hasn't lived up to your expectations, everyone expects the ending to be a BIG one; one that you didn't even see coming from a mile away. But the director sticks to a very common one that literally irritates you. And later when you dwell upon the movie, you say to yourself, "What was the point of that movie?"The acting was great; that I can tell you. Emraan Hashmi seems to be getting better with every movie he does. VIdya Balan was also good, but had much of a background role. And everyone else associated with the film did great. But it was wasted talent, as the plot played a spoiltsport.In the end, GHANCHAKKAR is a pointless film. It builds up your expectations to a point where you watch the film and it just crumbles down to spots. It just proves that Bollywood is trying to hard to be Hollywood. The film would have been alright if the ending had a GREATER and more powerful twist, but it doesn't, so it makes you leave the cinema just disappointed.GHANCHAKKAR- 5.5/10" 
" Fork(ing) funny!","Yeah! The fork here is a weapon to reckon with! If you, with a black sense of humor, can overlook done to death 'abusing the posterior' dialogues and the run of the mill 'déjà vu' character at the railway station then this one will keep you glued!Seriously: The pace didn't drag nor did I find the proceedings repetitive Balan wasn't over at all. In fact she should have been a tad crazier Hashmi carried the role with aplomb - after Shanghai The rest of the cast did a fine job Music is totally different and one of a kind! Balan and Hashmi's chemistry comes alive with well written dialogues, and it's like watching a real life couple Raj Kumar Gupta shows versatility after the serious Aamir and JessicaOn the other hand looking back smiling: Did Uttam really win a lottery ticket? Was Neetu really going to visit her sister in London?Was she really speaking to her sister on the phone? Apart from the suitcase full of money there was a bag too! So, who had it? Was it a coincidence Neetu met Uttam while checking an apartment to buy like she told Sunju when he suspects her having an affair with him? What exactly happened to Sunju that lead to sporadic amnesia? Where did Neetu had the dresses stitched? How much truth did Neetu tell Sunju when he angrily reacts saying she didn't inform him about this and that?The above questions are like salt at times missing from Neetu's cooking, but at the same time add mystery in the right amount to enjoy this crazy concoction! I hope it's a sleeper hit like 'Fukrey'!(Thought balloon: Is there a director's cut? With Sunjay Dutt's special appearance and some (missing) scenes like Neetu with an aerosol.)" 
" Cult Classic................","This one is definitely comparable to the 2007 Anurag Kashyap cult classic 'No-Smoking' If u love cult classics (like I do) you'd definitely enjoy this one. Emraan Haashmi and Vidya Balan have rendered tremendous performances as a couple trapped right in the center of a web of uncertainties and misunderstandings. Their overall condition as well as their relationship as husband and wife is rendered even more suffocating and is stretched to extreme limits because of the constant watchfulness of the two gangsters played very convincingly by Rajesh Sharma and Nandit Das. Nothing can be taken for granted in this film which starts testing your IQ and personality from the first shot till the very last frame...9 stars from this fan..Peace.." 
" Good performers alone cannot save a confused, slow & monotonous film.","If one considers the promising features of GHANCHAKKAR as a film, than they are so many that its really hard to believe that the project can go wrong in such a way. To name the key ones, it is the third film of director Rajkumar Gupta after two highly appreciated ones (AAMIR and NO ONE KILLED JESSICA). It has Vidya Balan, the trendsetter playing yet another unconventional role of a kinky & bold, Punjabi lady. It has Emraan Hashmi who regularly comes up with some not-so-routine experimental projects and has his own big fan following. It has two immensely talented actors Rajesh Sharma and Namit Das who can add a great value to the proceedings, unarguably. The exciting plot of the film deals with 'a crime' and 'memory loss' which gives enough space to the writers to add in some great comic punches and keep you entertained. The film has some interesting songs lead by "Lazy Lad" & its title song perfectly representing the grey characters in its script quite interestingly. And lastly it had some superb promos which were completely different from the usual stuff and showed some big sparks of a 'Hit' to almost everyone.However the bad news is that almost all the above promising features fail to deliver and the film disappoints hugely hanging in between the genres of a crime thriller and a comedy quite amateurishly. It begins well establishing all its main characters confidently and then goes on and on without adding anything significant in the narration following a shocking route. The first half does have some enjoyable moments to offer as promised but post that it all becomes quite slow as well as monotonous and the film has nothing more to say till the unexciting climax where the suspense is revealed.Actually GHANCHAKKAR falls flat due to the main reason that its not at all an engaging comedy as projected in its strong promos. Neither the characterization satisfies the viewer nor do the characters have something substantial to say other than what we have already seen in the trailers. Unfortunately the biggest disappointment comes from Vidya Balan only who keeps trying to justify a very confused and badly written character throughout, in an over the top manner. Emraan Hashmi too keeps struggling with his weak character uninterestingly and so do the other actors on the screen in their few scenes. In fact the only two focused actors are Rajesh Sharma & Namit Das in the entire film, who successfully give you the occasional entertaining moments here and there in gaps.As a novel story-plot, GHANCHAKKAR surely had got something great with a huge potential, waiting to be exploited in the best possible way on the screen. But the writing team surprisingly ruins it all and goes below the expected level just after the initial 30 minutes of the film, leading it to nowhere. As a result the viewer is simply eager to know the secret in the end and then walk away hurriedly. The film neither shapes up as a comic entertainer, nor turns into an interesting investigative crime thriller as it progresses which actually remains its main drawback right from the beginning. Though Amit Trivedi tries real hard to raise the tempo with his innovative background score and few pulsating tracks but without a specific direction it all goes in vain and fails to make an impact.To say it all, GHANCHAKKAR had all the required ingredients to make an excitingly delicious dish for the starving audience. But sometimes even that is not sufficient to make a worth trying recipe and the film is a fine example of the same quite clearly.Plus it is also one of those projects which repeatedly questions the funny functioning of our Film Censor Board, probably having different set of rules for different film-makers. And that's because in some films they readily agree to the abuses being spoken so clearly, but in the others the same objectionable words are taken out, muted or avoided with a beep sound. Moreover, I am really unable to understand that why this is not taken as an offence when a particular dialogue which has been muted in the original print of the film as per the Censor Board's instructions, the same dialogue is repeatedly shown in all the TV Channels in the homes so openly. Now isn't this making fun of our own official governing body or not?Anyway on that debatable note, its advised to watch another engaging crime thriller on DVD instead of GHANCHAKKAR this weekend and save yourself from a big disappointment in the theater." 
" The director tries to cash on the image of his actors' last movie to the maximum..","If Vidya Balan is in the movie, its next to impossible to start your views about the movie without her. After the long list of the movies she has done previously she has proved her mettle and become the better version of Lady Amir Khan (I know many people will kill me for saying this!!!). I don't know whether it was her conscious decision to choose this movie or her director persuaded her to cash on her Kahani Image, but it works well. The entire marketing campaign also seems to be designed on that line. But let me tell you straight away, though she is extremely good in the movie, the hero is undoubtedly Imraan Hashmi.For the detailed review, read : http://mayahirahasya.blogspot.in/2013/06/ghanchakkar.html" 
" Mindless","The movie tries to hard and falls flat at the end. Could have been a good plot, but its so bad as a story that no work on it could have saved it. Climax kills you as its the most silly thing one could have shown. Movie drags unnecessarily and somewhere in the second half you just want it to get over! When someone writes a thriller, it is important to have a good story and situations must be logical. But here the writer cares for neither. They can trust a stranger and keep money with him, but not simply divide and keep own share, and that's just the beginning. So much more happens without any logic. In a typical thriller, they try to show different possibilities and finally present a hilarious conclusion, which neither amazes you nor makes you laugh. Extremely bad movie, I would say!" 
" Suspenseful comedy that's ahead of its time","Remember when Andaz Apna Apna failed miserably at the box office? No one would have guessed that it would become of the most religiously beloved Bollywood cult films of all time. Ghanchakkar is in a similar boat, where the complexity of both the comedy and suspense aspects of the films are completely outside everyone's comfort zone. The films ending is what most people complain about, but that was, in my opinion, the cherry on top of a brilliant dark comedy." 
" Super excited movie","Good concept
Good suspension
Good thriller
Nice to see if you want the best way for your time today" 
" The wait is over...the perfect companion piece to Mithya","Gupta's first feature, 'Aamir', obtained its 'inspiration' from the Filipino cult-classic' 'Cavite', and as such, I thought he should not have been so blatantly obvious about it, notwithstanding it's excellent soundtrack (something his next feature also had in spades). I did enjoy his next, 'No one killed Jessica', which was culled various newspaper reports on the case, and made for an engaging drama (less a thriller, more a drama, IMHO), and was lookin' fwd to this, in spite of thinking' that the plot was probably being lifted from Danny Boyle's 'Trance', and wishing he wasn't so blatant about his inspirations though. (I have since changed my opinion about this one and 'Trance', having seen both)Poised, I hope to be cult classic. Must've confused the hell outa the marketing team, who've managed to (wrongly, and to the movie's detriment) pitch this as a comedy. There sure are dark comedic overtones, but make no mistake, this is a drama first, thriller next, with little doses of uneven dark humor sprinkled across. In retrospect, it tells a very simple story. Memory loss (yes, think 'Trance' again), heist, is-he-lying, or is-she kinda setups. Boasts one of the best performances from Balan (who almost tops her own turn in 'Kahaani'), while giving everyone something to do. Hashmi has proved he can be a force in the acting department, given the right director (Banerjee's Shanghai saw him at his best), and he's fantastic here, since the movie hinges on his selling us his character's predicament. And here, we come to the crux of the matter: Hashmi's so good, that I was able to downplay the bad writing/direction that have gone into removing any semblance of consistency from the central conceit, all in favor of making it a whodunnit-kinda farce. While this is refreshing from the POV of not knowing what might happen next, it falls flat on reflection, and that 'falling flat' happens within the movie's duration itself, unfortunately. Excellent camera-work and background score complement Gupta's ambition, but to me, this will be his also-ran-but-try-harder-next-time effort from his end. This one has one of the best endings I've ever seen committed to celluloid, but that still wasn't enough from me still thinking of what could've been, and writing thus. No need to for me to state this explicitly, but this is definitely much superior to the run-of-the-mill product playing even in multiplexes, so I do hope the people encourage these Indies by watching them at a cinema close by. Definitely a keeper, even in terms of DVD/Blu."
