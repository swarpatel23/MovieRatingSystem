" A fabulous movie","Let me start by saying that this movie has everything right about it. From direction and cinematography to performances and music. The locations are breath taking.Imtiaz Ali yet again delivers a "hat ke" love story. Its not exactly a love story but a tale of two people who want to get free and experience life. Both the characters have there own painful pasts and when they come together they let it all go and try to start it all over again.Their journey is the theme of this movie. Alaya Bhatt and Randeep Hooda deliver power packed performances with a great supporting cast.The movie forces us to think about the society we live in and how people struggle to lead a normal life. Be it a rich family or a poor villager. They have there own challenges.I won't go more into the story line as that is something to be experienced.This movie comes with a message and we are left to think what freedom and liberation means.I will strongly recommend this one." 
" A Masterpiece piece of Art !!","THIS MOVIE IS A MASTERPIECE...This movie has a soul...a silent scream of a person that has nowhere to go and no one to speak to...and so life is just a HIGHWAY !! Two people from different economic strata, brought together by fate, yet having similar childhood of mistrust, trauma and abuse. There is that void..a deep hole within the soul... that can never ever be forgotten and never be filled ever again. This movie has so many layers deep within it... like how men react differently to traumatic childhood by being aggressive and secluded within, longing for the mother figure to comfort them, and women on the other hand become carefree, wanting to just run from it all and always longing for that father figure that can take care of her always. Imitiaz Ali has researched it so well that you can feel the pain, the inappropriate joy ...and the crazy feeling of comfort in the most strange circumstances. Brilliant piece of art with such a grey hue and painted on landscape of colors !! Alia bhatt..has talent..plenty, plenty of it, and randheep hooda is brilliant. Imitiaz Ali knows the soul and heart of a woman and recreates it well in all its brilliance... a MUST watch Film !!" 
" randeep hooda acted really well. aliya was good. the movie reminds me of Clint Eastwood movie the perfect world.","The movie is thought provoking and it deals with a social message. Lovely cinematography with a power to heal, to nurture and free you soul. It made me want to almost pack my bags and take off into the unknown, the joy of lying down beneath the stars, beside a river or even just driving through snow-capped mountains is enticing to say the least. Tie this with an intense relationship involving two individuals carrying wounds so deep that unconsciously draw them into each other's spheres of existence, changing their lives forever. A journey that takes them to the core of their being leaving an impact that is life –altering, forever. As is the case with such connections, happy ending are often rare and the movie kept it real. Well directed and well acted movie. 1000 times better than Gunday." 
" Imtiaz Ali's personal and close to his heart film","I regard Imtiaz Ali so highly that I dread watching his every new film. I fear that his new creation will disappoint me. No man can always hit the bulls eye every time. After watching the film, I feel ashamed that I had any doubts about him. The guy is a true genius and his every movie is like poetry on film. Lucky are the actors he decides to work with. He brings the absolute best in them.Highway is his most personal and non-commercial film. It is as if he decided to reward himself after making lots of successful mainstream movies and made a movie close to his heart. I expect even people who liked his previous movies may not like Highway. It is easy to dismiss it as too far-fetched to happen in real life.Both Alia and Randeep are great – Alia more so as it is essentially her story. Her natural look without makeup suits the role. Best way to watch a movie is to know nothing about it. So I am not going to reveal anything of the plot.Be patient while watching Highway. The last half hour will blow you away." 
" A Cinematic Triumph -- "HIGHWAY"","This is really very hard for me to put this in down in words what I loved about Highway or why I loved it. There are moments when Alia Bhatt's character, Veera, laughs and cries and doesn't know why she is expressing her emotions this way. Honestly, I decided not to review this film. Not because I don't want to, I really want to. Except this is one of those rare times where I might not be able to explain why I loved a film so much. Highway is a film that starts like a typical genre film about a girl being kidnapped. The rest of it is not like a genre film about a girl being kidnapped at all. It is probably not even like an Imtiaz Ali film. Then again, this might be the film he's been wanting to make all this while. Everybody loved Jab We Met (2007), a film so likable and perfectly mainstream. Love Aaj Kal (2009) and Rockstar (2011) divided the audience. The latter more than the former but the latter also garnered more passionate support thanks to Ranbir Kapoor's performance and A. R. Rahman's brilliant music. Highway will certainly divide the audience as well.There is a moment in the film where Veera asks Mahabir (Randeep Hooda) if he likes mountains or beaches. I'm a mountain person. It's not that I dislike beaches but I just prefer mountains. I think this would have a lot to do with whether you connect with this film or not. This film borders on a fantastical road movie, sometimes it becomes a love story and then it becomes a film about a girl's emancipation from her cage. She connects with nature, outside and inside. The first half of the film is more conventional but the more it went away from conventions; the more I fell in love with it, by the time it went for interval I already had goose bumps. It happened gradually and at the end it reached a crescendo.Alia Bhatt is absolutely stunning in this film. She acts her heart out. She made an appearance on her mentor's chat show recently and said she considers Parineeti Chopra her competition. Like anyone who has seen her in Student of the Year (2012), I laughed off her comment as wishful thinking. Here she is giving solid competition to her and probably even outdoing her at places. More than anything, I admire her decision to do a film like this one when she could have done any other, safer film. I'm sure she will do movies that make her a star and capture the attention of the mainstream audience but it feels great to witness young talent taking a bold chance instead of treading the usual path. The film has a denouement. After the climax, the film goes on for about 10 minutes and she lets it all go. I was absolutely astonished and overwhelmed with emotion. The inexplicable kind.Randeep Hooda plays the typical brooding silent but angry criminal. He doesn't overdo it; neither does he underplay it so much that we don't see a performance. This is a performance that could get sidelined because of Alia Bhatt's explosive turn but it is definitely his finest hour. Anil Mehta captures the beauty of the north Indian terrain and the vast expanse of the Himalayan foothills. There is silence in his images. A. R. Rahman hardly goes wrong. Patakha Guddi and Maahi Ve are one of the most wonderful songs he has ever created. I'm beginning to think he writes lyrics for them as well and then a lyricist translates them into Hindi.There might be many flaws in the film as far as balanced critique is concerned. It's a slow- paced film but so is life. Its ideas are sublime and silent but so is the bliss and peace during a meditative state. When films try to be spiritual, they end up being intellectual. As I confessed at the beginning of the review, I wouldn't be aware of the flaws because I was too busy being in love with the film and love, as they say, is quite blind. They also say it's not the destination but the journey that matters. Everyone quotes it but not many know what it means or want to feel it. I don't know if I know what it means but Imtiaz Ali knows and he has beautifully depicted it on screen. All our roads lead to one destination. How we go there is on us. It's my way or the "high"way. Ali takes the second route and offers us a chance to travel with him. Travel inside. There are so many filmmakers who would make thrilling entertainment out of the same material. They might have the character being raped and turn it into a social document or a gripping race against time escape-movie. Imtiaz Ali has the guts to infuse the film with love. It's not a love story but a film about love, it's a film about breaking free from the things that bind you, taking us away from love. It is never maudlin or sentimental. It doesn't stop to be a heavy-handed sermon either. It's a cathartic, profound experience.I was a puddle at the end of the film and I don't know why. How do I explain why I was tearful? Artists can always do things they want to without having to explain their creative decisions. Critics are not artists. We are just an audience who has been given the privilege to write about our reaction to cinematic products, works of art and everything else in between. I apologize for not being able to give you valid reasons why this is an artistic triumph but I feel it is. Imtiaz Ali may not be considered an artist. For me, he most certainly is and Highway is his most beautiful expression." 
" Magical...","When we just begin to loose hope in Hindi Cinema, movies like Highway are made which makes us fall in love with Bollywood all over again. Highway is definitely not a typical Hindi movie made these days. It has a soul in it. Watching Imtiyaz Ali's movie is like reading a book. Every emotion is expressed in such a way that you remain in a long hangover even days after watching his creation. May it be 'Socha na tha', 'Jab we Met', 'Love aaj kal' , ' rockstar' and now 'Highway' in one point or the other one could relate them self with the characters.Highway is one such movie where silence is the weapon used with just the characters talking with their performance. They don't need hefty dialogues, well nor do they need mere words to convey the emotions that they are going through. The most surprising factor was Alia bhat. No one would have imagined after watching SOTY that she could deliver such a terrific performance. But she has nailed it as Veera. Veera makes us smile, cry and also laugh when least expected and makes us fall in love with her. Randeep Hooda is up to the mark. Mahabir is tailor made character for Randeep. I cant imagine anyone playing Mahabir with such an ease. Not to forget, the major credit goes to cinematographer as well. The location are captured in such a way that you can almost smell the Highway and feel the chill of chilling mountains. I could not afford to even wink my eyes, especially in the second half of the movie as the screen has turned so mesmerizing which has a capacity to leave ones eyes struck to the screen and the mouth open in an awe. I heard few people complaining that the climax is not satisfactory. But, I personally think that this was the perfect climax for such a story. The movie will stay with you long after you are out of the cinema hall. Which rarely happen these days.Don't go to watch it with high expectations. You will be disappointed. Just go with a calm mind and slowly get indulge in the beauty of this magical movie." 
" Imtiaz Ali's best work till date","I absolutely loved it. It had such an impact on me that i couldn't stop thinking about it whole night. The cinematography was ethereal. The direction was beautiful. I've always loved Imtiaz Ali's direction. I don't know why people criticize him. He is one of the best directors we've in bollywood. The cinematic understanding that this guy have is unbelievable. RANDEEP HOODA man o man what a breathetaking performance. He absolutely nailed Mahabir's character. This has to be the most underrated performance in years. The guy is seriously talented and deserves much more than he's getting. Alia Bhatt was amazing. Considering it was just her 2nd film she did exceptionally well. The real hero of the movie was Imtiaz Ali. The layers that he put in the characters can only be done by an artist with exceptional talent. 4.5/5 from my side." 
" Highway - all the way","'HIGHWAY - Imtiaz Ali' Its all the way just my way or the Highway Imtiaz Ali is NOT the 'on your face' kind of Director but he certainly is very well on the saddle/the hand behind the wheel  totally in control. So whether you like it or not, the story simmers and seeps through the crevices deep into your veins, slowly, no hurry; no intention to make any point. It's Imtiaz all the way and he sure, is a wanderer subtly like all his earlier movies (jab we met/ rock-star/ 'Love Aaj Kal'/ 'Socha Na Tha'), he shall take you on a ride to India and make you realize how much you have missed all these years, not wandering. He is probably the guy who could have easily fitted well with NatGeo. May be he lives the moments that he wants to live – through his movies, may be he entices you, invites you to live/ relive those moments, may be. So this 'Highway' also moves. It lives up the name, a constant hum of alternate emptiness while the visuals zip past, picture perfect - perfect, anamorphic widescreen shots; just the right exposure wherein the inter-wined scenes give out an Expanse all around. Lot of bonnet- front panned shots which open up visual sectors wide angled as you move ahead, these and those reverse shots from where the camera turns a full 180 degrees to take you back to the front. I mean, achieving all this in a feature film is tremendous especially when the whole movie is shot with natural lighting. And along with it, a subtle (not loud) story chugs along beautifully. Nothing is aggressive ever, even when people get aggressive once a while it's a highway, remember!Imtiaz had this passion of sanctifying the childhood. He does that in all the movies; it keeps his present intentions well heeled in what went by. It's always important for his stories. Sure then, the protagonists are always trying to free themselves up, get out there in the open. Its an yearning, well yearned for! It keeps the things in perspective, unbound!!To sum it up: you can't just be passive, nonchalant, yuck-Yanky in Highway. It sure breathes in some restlessness, differently for every different people; you want to react, getup, breathe out!!! And Highway helps you gulp out the welt, 'welp'! The narrative is smooth, the lessons are bitter; dialogs are simple, sound is perfect, music is just the right amount and blend (AR Rahman).What would you look for --- Imtiaz Ali, who has a different script (always) and is amazingly observant while being silent (always shows you both sides of the coin in all his movies – while slyly hinting at the upper class society), Strong female lead as always (even Alia Bhatt has been made to act – high notch, very promising now), Randeep Hooda – just fantastic, very original, very mature, needs to be casted more often (if only Gunday was made with him and Ranveer), India – because you still haven't seen it all, felt it –need to be on a highway.What not to expect – 'Totta Maina Ki Kahani', 'Naach Gaana' PT style, bubbly looks, third-rate jokes. That's Imtiaz's way or take the Highway!" 
" Beautifully scripted movie along the roads of north India.","IMHO...Excellent... beautiful... superlative... three words i am very wary of using when describing a movie... the rarer i do it, the more importance it holds.GET ON THIS HIGHWAY.Ramesh Sippy had his Sholay, Alia Bhat has her HIGHWAY. This young actress, i never thought good of (i gave her Student of the Year a wide berth). Here she has kept me riveted for a good length of time with her facial contortions... her voice, her silence, her eyes, her dressing..... everything. her transformation from a cocooned girl to a free butterfly during the course of the movie is sublime. ill give her a perfect 12 out of 10. and she didn't have to resort to ANY skin show; no T&A here, pure genes at play. She shines. the movie belongs to her, and she excels.the story is simple, the subplots un-complicated. be it the horny accomplice (well its essentially a kidnapping story), the good at heart sidekick, the adequately sinister/ curiously enigmatic randeep hooda (more on him later, he deserves a separate writeup), the camera work, the locations, the un-obtrusive soundtrack and music that grows on you. i found very little to complain about in the movie. probably Alia's Stockholm Syndrome kicked in too early into the movie, but im willing to overlook it.Randeep Hooda has the kind of brooding, lingering, intense screen presence that you'd associate with say a Ajay Devgn. tough to find fault. the way he hisses his expletives, the snarling of a person with a repressed background, the slow unfolding of a soft core, the endearing body language and sheer rugged sexiness. WOW. from the rustic dialect, to the clothes, to the grime filled fingernails... the effort to live the character is commendable.the background score and the songs, the overall tempo of the movie is very well complimented with the accompaniments. the purpose of good music is not to make its presence felt, but to ensure that its absence will hamper the narrative. That happens here. i don't remember a word of any song sung in the movie, but i know it was essential to drive the movie forward.The locations depicted in the movie, the adept camera-work made me want to whip out my cell phone and take pictures of the screen. the mountains, the overhanging cliffs along the routes, the beautiful countryside (kashmir/ rajasthan, lovely roads)... the lenses have been taught to fall in love with the locations. Zero doubt about it.watch the movie... Watch The Movie... WATCH THE MOVIE...good acting, good direction, good camera-work, good story, a well handled sensitive subplot, brilliant characters... what else do you need?" 
" You are now on the highway. Please Applaud !","I have a soft corner for Imtiaz Ali. Dating back to an interaction two decades back. I almost stood up when I first saw Jab We Met. The surprises at every corner of the road traveled by Shahid and Kareena were absolute delights. He evoked a classy sense of humor in Love Aaj Kal and then I watched with disconcert not sure if I had liked RockStar. Having been drunk on the heavenly music of the movie by Maestro A R Rahman and after practically selling Pataka Guddi to everyone who wanted to hear, the wait for the movie was finally worth it.The verdict straight away. I wanted to stand up again. Just microscopically short of being a marvelous and a great movie. The opening kidnapping scene takes you back to Roja, when another master Mani had led you to the hills and captured them with the camera caressing nature careful not to pollute it with attention too much. I bit my lips praying that the wonderful songs by ARR were not tucked into the screenplay to pop up jarringly to justify themselves.The film is not about a story. It is about treatment. It is about loving your country well enough to make it appear more alluring than a dozen other over rated countries. It is the ability to see beauty as much in a whole row of dilapidated trucks lost in time as in a snow laden country racing by, or taking the road less traveled alongside a river with virgin gurgling waters.The protagonist Alia lands up, in a sequence of events, on a road journey with her apparently malicious perpetrator. Being on the run is not used as an excuse to showcase scenery but knowingly used as a tool to allow the individuals who are hurting from deep within to unravel themselves. If you do not allow yourself to be sucked into their lives you may find the plot-line dreary because you cannot connect with the alternating misery and happiness of the main leads.The girl is from a wealthy and powerful family and appears gung-ho about life. Till the road journey scratches her surface provoking her to abandon efforts to get back to her cozy life and instead tease out the wound which appeared to have healed externally but is hurting deep within. The experience mirrors in the male lead Randeep's evolution in the journey. Brilliantly interweaving personal stories within the main matrix of a kidnapping used as a tool to lay out the emotional wares, Imtiaz is simply outstanding out doing himself in the process and marching into uncharted territory without sacrificing the entertainment index.Talking too much particulars and specifics of the movie will actually destroy the experience of watching it and the hard work put in creating the various moments an accumulation of which actually completes the experience, will be lost. Softly nudging the story along is AR Rahman with his soulful numbers never ever appearing out of place and taking care never to intrude into the narrative and when it does with Pataka Guddi, Alia simply traces out the music with her fingers in the air. She even sings a lullaby with not a note lost.There are many winners in this movie. Randeep Hooda, a wonderful actor who has been floundering for some time now trying to make a niche for himself has found his cut with this role. He performs it with the right amount of restraint never once going overboard or hamming to overwhelm his own character.Director Imtiaz Ali brings a lot of serenity with his very clear presence behind the camera. The editing is seamless aided by great photography except when camera shots on top of a truck giving the front and the back views are totally disconnected, the rear camera showing a well tarred road and the front one showing a narrow rough road. Obviously very bad editing at that point. Perhaps they thought no one would notice it but it jars!There are wonderful real people all along the screen play and they live up to their individual roles with natural vigor creating memorable characters. Imtiaz merits each character in the story with an uniqueness that allows them to stand out on their own and make a mark in the few moments that they are on screen. Last seen only in Lagaan or Swades.And as for the main female lead. Dare I say that this is the performance of the year? Perhaps in the last few years only Vidya Balan has come this close with her natural flair in Kahaani. Here we see a full throated performance from Alia who gives herself up to the director and his vision. This is one of the most spirited natural performances in recent times. Be ready to get choked in a final long gut wrenching climax carried on shoulders fully by the young girl. The signs of a star certainly.Want to be surprised? Want to flush the bad experiences of some bad movies recently? Enter this Zen like audio visual experience. And you will not regret. So why not a full five star rating. Because the film is allowed to intentionally flag at some places making the narrative appear to be taking a pause. But this is highly debatable in terms of the impact they could have on the final output.It is the total sum of all the effects that complete the experience for the audience. It is difficult to believe that the movie has not been shot chronologically. So perfect is the transition from scene to scene. This is a craft difficult to create and easy to comment on. For today I will just applaud! Well done Imtiaz!" 
" Spiritual","Well the movie is simple,realistic,beautifully shot,has nice music and is diligently acted.If you are looking for an out of the box movie,this movie is not for you. It is for those soul, who believe more in spiritual form of love rather than physical.It touches you at various level, though revolving around a linear storyline.The movie also touches upon various important social issues without being redundant and preachy such as child abuse,class difference etc.It also never appears to be overacted, though the scene in the second half where Alia confronts ghost of her past seems quite elongated.All in all a good clean family movie with a soulful core and a genuine message you can take back home.One of the best works of Imtiaz after Jab we Met ..one of the most soulful indeed.Though we all know practically in real life a lot of things are not possible ,but these movies sometimes gives us a hope to believe in good ...and in spiritual love.After all some movies are meant to make you oblivious about reality...for sometime." 
" A drive on the Highway worth taking !!!!","Highway (Review) – After 'Rockstar', director Imtiaz Ali is now back with his latest road movie 'Highway' starring Randeep Hooda and Alia Bhatt in the lead. Even though there wasn't as much hype, the movie had created a healthy buzz. 'Highway' begins with Veera Tripathi played by Alia Bhatt being kidnapped while she is on a highway with her fiancé by a group of gangsters and one of them being Mahabir Bhati played by Randeep Hooda. Veera is kidnapped by Mahabir Bhati and his gang as she has witnessed a roadside shootout at a petrol pump by the gang. Veera is the daughter of a VIP in Delhi and the gang is unaware of it and when they get to know about it, they continue keeping her in custody trying to blackmail Veera's family for ransom. Veera who is initially traumatised by the whole saga slowly gets used to being with the gang and starts enjoying her time with them as she would never have had that much freedom back home. Veera once describes the entire trauma that she underwent as a child in her family to Mahabir after which he starts to be a bit more considerate towards her. Mahabir and his gang alongwith Veera keep travelling from one place to another all over India. Meanwhile the search for Veera is on in full swing back in Delhi. This forms the first half of the movie. What happens to Veera? Will she finally be back with her family, is to be watched in what is the best part of the movie, the beautiful and an engaging second half. The best technical aspect of the film is the cinematography as the highways and the mountains and the streams in Himachal Pradesh are captured beautifully. Performance of Alia Bhatt might seem like a shadow of Kareena Kapoor in 'Jab We Met' for the first 5 minutes but later enters into her own zone and has performed brilliantly in a couple of scenes. Randeep Hooda plays the tough guy throughout the movie and also a man showing his emotions when reminded of his mother very well. Music by the maestro A.R. Rahman is also worth appreciating as a couple of tracks like Patakha Guddi, Sooha Sooha and Maahi Ve stand out. Rahman leaves his stamp in Maahi Ve especially. Oscar winner Resul Pookutty has done a brilliant job in sound design as well. Imtiaz Ali has done a commendable job in making this movie and presenting the way it should be without adding unnecessary junk. Movies of this kind need to be promoted and encouraged as they form a perfect bridge between class and mass films thereby paving the way for other filmmakers to make similar attempts. Watch 'Highway' for its authenticity, ethnicity, brilliant camera-work and a beautiful second half. My verdict – 8/10" 
" A high cinematic experience","I used to consider Imtiaz Ali to be quite overrated, but with Highway, my opinion of him has changed dramatically. Highway is one of the most beautiful films of recent times in Hindi cinema, in terms of both photography and storytelling. Telling the story of a young girl kidnapped in an act she herself would eventually consider pure bliss, Highway starts as a road movie and what could have become a suspenseful thriller of sorts, turns into a deeply involving love story between two aching souls. The captive girl finds a true saviour in her captor and eventually falls for him, showing little interest in coming back home. The movie is not without its clichés, and the sub-story of child abuse the young woman had been through as a child tends to be a little corny, but then everything is handled with great delicacy. It is emotional but totally controlled and sensible, all thanks to Ali, who deals with the complex subject with impressive understanding and Aided by brilliant cinematography, the movie is beautifully shot across some of North India's most breathtaking locations, but not only does it capture the beauty of India's exotic mountains and the magic of its simplicity, it consistently stands as a celebration of the human spirit and conveys a meaning of freedom is spite of the potentially troubling proceedings. The film is slow paced, but totally engaging and absorbing, and that's because the story is expertly developed, with the ensuing portions of romance working quite effectively. Everything grows naturally, and what starts with a quietly serene narrative style is gradually filled with music up to a point where the narrative is nothing but music and high spirit. And for that you have to thank the master himself, A. R. Rahman, whose stupendous soundtrack and score enhance the film and its story. The songs are in sync with the proceedings and always reflect the characters' state.The acting is excellent even by actors appearing in minor parts. The lead pair is played by Randeep Hooda and Alia Bhatt, and the two have fantastic chemistry. The romantic tension between the two is built up with great conviction - it never looks peculiar in spite of the nature of their parts, and never looks missing in spite of the lack of too much physical interaction. Hooda is tremendous as Mahabir, brilliantly underplaying the essence of a man who may look cruel and fearless, but beneath this tough exterior there's a poor, compassionate and quietly tormented soul. But the movie belongs to young Bhatt, who's pretty and bubbly but just totally immersed in the spirited character of Veera, so much that even she herself might not have expected from herself. She seems to really get the resilient nature of her part, but rather than playing it, she lives it, presenting an exhilarating portrait of strength, determination and positivity.Highway ends on a poignant but realistic note, and the ending is extremely cathartic and satisfying. It ends up being a greatly affecting love story which surely is inspiring to watch, and besides that it is a true visual treat worth watching more than once. A rewarding cinematic experience, highly recommended." 
" Surprised!","I am not a great fan of Imtiaz's earlier two movies. This movie had everything to like. That's why I said I was surprised. Starting with the cinematography and camera works. The first half is very gripping and the story just flows like a quiet river. Second half is equally good. Background score is awesome. Liked the way the songs have been used to take the story forward. AR Rahman is awesome as always. No lip-sync songs. Only background ones.I also found the movie to be a bit spiritual in way because its impossible to think the two central characters would fall in love (or may be they didn't, they just empathised with each other). Now just compare this with physical love.Randeep Hooda looked his part. Must have worked hard to live that character on screen. Alia is good. We have to wait for her next movies to see how good she is. Imtiaz has done a great work to make the story believable. Mahabir's character development in particular was well written.I would give extra two stars for the director's honesty. (Because I think his earlier two movies had shades of economics, read commercial.)This has to be one of the best Hindi movies made." 
" Great Film !!","'Highway' is one of those few original stories Bollywood produces once in a while and satisfy those looking for something different, rather than the same old rehashed love/action movies. The cast meshed perfectly with each other, both Alia and Randeep had obvious chemistry. Most of the movie is shot against the beautiful terrain of India in a particular lighting that sometimes makes you feel you're watching an indie art film but that only adds to the presentation.The score is amazing and compliments the particular scenarios.The reason i gave this is a 7 is because the movie does have its rough edges, the two most pivotal moments of the film were extremely rushed i.e. when Veera gets comfortable with her kidnappers and second, when she eventually starts falling for her kidnapper Mahabir. More time should have been focused on these arcs in order for Veera's change of heart seem more believable to the viewer.You could easily write a book with this story and IMHO would have done more justice.Despite this its a great movie and well worth your time and money." 
" Captivating and Heartbreaking Romance/Drama With Intriguing & Deep Characters! (P.S. There's No Stockholm Syndrome Involved)","With 'Highway', a captivating and heartbreaking Romance/Drama, Imtiaz Ali is back to his charming and likable sensibilities like that of 'Jab We Met' and 'Love Aaj Kal', after the terrible 'Rockstar' (though its first half was excellent). The only exception is that in this movie, the characters have proper depth and originality which is quite rare in Hindi movies. Other than Anil Mehta's visual mastery (cinematography) and A.R.Rahman's enchanting background score, it's young Alia Bhatt's groundbreaking performance that gives the movie its soul.Veera (Alia Bhatt), who's a girl from a rich family, is incidentally kidnapped by a group of thugs, headed by Mahabir (Randeep Hooda), after she accidentally witnesses a shootout. The journey and few circumstances eventually make these two people affectionate to each other. I'm completely sick and tired of audiences and critics going on and on about how the movie is about Stockholm Syndrome and almost celebrates it, and how it's morally disturbing in a country where women's safety is a concern. First of all, Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which the hostage expresses empathy/sympathy towards its captor/aggressor, which is mainly one way the ego defends itself. Military/fraternity/college hazing or ragging, and earlier Hindi movies like 'Kabul Express' and 'Raavan' might be taken as examples of this syndrome, but not this movie. People who watch the movie closely and properly would clearly understand that the movie is nowhere near to this syndrome; it mainly speaks about two souls, who were captives of their own lives, finding freedom and solace in each others' presence during their incidental journey. Veera, who was a victim of child abuse and always felt claustrophobic in her own house, finally finds herself free as she passes through these beautiful places across north of India. Mahabir, who has had painful and not-so-memorable childhood where his mother was the only caretaker, ends up in a life of robbery and thuggery to take revenge on the society which kept his mother and him in such menial circumstances; his heart melts when Veera, a girl from the kind of rich families he has grown to hate, shows such affection towards him in spite of knowing the kind of person he is, and he feels guilty thinking that he doesn't deserve such love after the kind of life he has led. And thus, a bond is etched between the two lost souls.I never expected characters with such depth in Imtiaz's movie, but I really applaud him for his effort. It was refreshing to see such characters in a Bollywood movie. The story is quite intriguing as well. Hope he continues this trend rather than going completely mainstream.Now let's come to the star of the movie. Alia Bhatt, who in her debut film ('Student of the Year') had a not-so-substantial and glamorous role, completely stuns you with her riveting portrayal of Veera. Whether it's the upbringing in a movie family, or the brilliant efforts of her Director Imtiaz Ali, or her proper research on the subject, whatever it is... you don't expect such a powerful and moving performance from a 20-year-old from her second movie. Alia proves to be a skillful actress, just like her half-sister Pooja Bhatt, with her in-depth character portrayal and wide range of emotions. The laughter-cum-breakdown scene over the rock over a stream, the tears-of-joy moment at the bus station, and the family confrontational scene towards the end are her emotional highlights of the movie. There's a scene in which she suddenly starts dancing on the road to techno-pop song in a Britney way and one of the kidnappers starts dancing behind her in typical Indian steps; the situation shocks you as much it does Mahabir, but it's quite hilarious and entertaining as well. Randeep Hooda is commendable as well for his portrayal of Mahabir, and forms a good support as the angry and brooding thug/kidnapper who finally finds happiness by letting go of all the anger. The highway across the Northern Indian terrain itself becomes one of the characters in the film, and the terrific way in which Anil Mehta captures it is exquisite. From the dry empty deserts and the rural folk music of Rajasthan, the roadside vendors, the street dhabas, to the gushing streams, the wafting clouds, and the snowy mountains of the Himalayas... all these just add to the beauty of the movie. And A.R.Rahman's minimalistic yet spellbinding music helps to carry the movie forward in its simplistic charm.It's a journey worth taking and relishing. The situations and characters provide a lot of ground for discussions."
