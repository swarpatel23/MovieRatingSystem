" I wish this was made with a better vision, at a bigger scale & supported by one of the Big Khans.","Certain films are made with a noble vision and a specific purpose which is courageous as well as an important one in the present world cunningly obsessed with religion in a questionable manner. And YA RAB is certainly one of those appreciable attempts which questions the Islamic link with the terrorism and then puts up many blunt arguments from both the sides, impressively quoting the HOLY QURAN in some solid, well written dialogues.Technically speaking, yes the execution gives you the feel of a tacky film with lots of shouting, hamming and overacting by the main actors. The production values are compromising and the film also follows a highly preachy way to say all the right things. But the message is indeed an important one and it needs to reach all the youngsters out there who are sadly used as a means to propagate terrorism by influencing their immature thought process. Director Hasnain Hyderabadwala comes to the point right from the first scene itself and clearly counters the way The Holy Scriptures are being interpreted in the wrong manner by all the Religious teachers or leaders for their own hidden interests. For instance, a valuable dialogue in the film says that, "Strangely the whole world has found only one word in The HOLY QURAN i.e. JIHAAD and is spreading its wrong meaning all over the globe to justify various things." Further it clearly reveals that this particular word & wrong interpretations of the Holy Text is not only being used by the others but by the community people too with a motive of misguiding the innocent youth and using them as their disposable tools of terrorism. Another important sequence in the film also strongly points towards the 'Blind Donations' a person usually gives to the religious leader, taking it as his moral duty which in reality might be contributing as a fund raiser to some objectionable underground activities leading to terrorism. And I really feel this is a quite significant point to understand by every person of any age, irrespective of his religion or region.Looking at the film from this particular perspective, YA RAB is a genuine effort made to show the right meaning of Islam and its sacred teachings. And the film also has certain worth watching elements which take this positive thought forward in a pretty decent way. Like, it has an intelligent little boy who remembers his holy scriptures by heart and understands them much better than many grownups around. An elderly religious leader, who knows, accepts and declares that everyone is wrongly interpreting the things and misleading the youth, whereas this is not the Islam I have learned and understood. And then there is a well known neurosurgeon, who is religious by heart but also a highly qualified medical practitioner who knows the importance & use of both religion and science individually.So in the writing department, we do have some well conceived characters, powerful dialogues and few counter explanations too revealing all the actual meanings. But the film does have its own shortcomings in terms of presentation, execution and performances which convert it into a loud melodramatic project made with a focused and positive mindset. For example Akhilendra Mishra could have done it more calmly without shouting and stretching his tone dramatically. Ajaz Khan shows the sparks in few scenes but still needs to come out of his acting school sessions fast. The lead pair along with the entire supporting cast are just OK and the 2 major saviors in the performance section remain S.M. Zaheer as the learned Maulana and Manzar Sehbai from Pakistan playing the thoughtful neurosurgeon. In fact I was most interested in watching the film for Manzar Sehbai alone remembering his towering performance in the masterpiece BOL (2011). And he didn't disappoint me at all standing amid all the other loud performers, especially in the climax. Cinematography captures the final moments of riots, ambulance and chaos competently and background score does make its presence felt, particularly in the tense sequences.In all, YA RAB is a kind of precious effort which should be ideally watched by all simply ignoring its weaker points, performances or production values. Director Hasnain Hyderabadwala has made it in search of a better world around and his noble effort does need to be applauded by one and all, unanimously. However I seriously wish YA RAB gets remade soon with a better vision, at a bigger scale and featuring one of the BIG KHANS. So if any one of them is listening then just go for it or any similar effort, as this would be your earnest gift both to your profession as well as to your respected religion.in search of a better harmonious future for our coming generations." 
" entertaining movie with some messages","I had read two articles that were bad. I just watched the movie, Feb. 12, and I really enjoyed it. My favorite character was Dr Mazhar khan. he fought so hard for saving that babies life, and it the writers established the connection through Amreen as his assistant. it was a beautiful connection. Dr Mazhar reminds me of many many of my respected elders. I like how the Shake of the bad Shake was also interviewed and such.I seriously enjoyed the song placement, it was absolutely beautiful. the first one while Imran was reminiscing while watching over her. and the second one during action. the songs fit so well.And Ajaz Khan, the reason I was attracted to this, was spectacular. I was surprised so much by the ending, it was beautiful though, especially what the sister had to say to Javed after that. Absolutely beautiful. Ajaz playing a Hindu and helping and fighting for not the Muslims (as they were misguided by the bad Shake) but as ACP he was fighting for Allah. absolutely beautiful movie. The one thing I hated about Ajazs character was the "oh s**t" line, that was stupid.I seriously enjoyed the language in this movie, absolutely enjoyed it. The movie really took you through so much by the amazingly developed characters, like Javad and especially Dr Mazar.Just a beautiful movie that shows mob mentality is affecting so many today, not just Muslims but the whole world, because when one Muslim does something the whole world mobs against Islam. And when a person of not Islamic faith does something some of us Muslims over react. We should be calm and cool like Dr Mazhar.I seriously loved how Imran was fighting and protecting his wife and child towards the end it was beautiful, I didn't like how he cried so much when he first heard of Amreens situation, but the physical fight he put up for his wife and child was touching.Also when his dad told him to stop the car and stuff, Imrans obedience to his parents was beautiful. One part I didn't like was Imran saying I would take you even if you say please for shopping. And the other was when the bad Shakes wife was complaining about preparing the dinner table for her husband. People should take pride in taking care of someone in such a way, especially a loved one. What do you want to do for your loved ones? Take care of them right? And making food for them is a burden? This makes no sense to me.My favorite line by was by Ajaz to Sumaiya "Be proud to be Muslim" line "Fakhar hona chaiye" line. I didn't like how Sumaiya was ashamed to be Muslim though. But Ajaz's line there was beautiful.Closing notes, I really enjoyed the ~12 year old, he was a joy. Speaking the truth, especially when he spoke how the Quran speaks against suicide, and his grandpa is big Shake and if suicide did take you to Janna he would have been the first. All Muslims know this for a fact, but people that are not Muslim think that Muslims think suicide is acceptable, this is unbelievable. Even a small child strongly knows against it, this is how 100% Muslims think. It's unbelievable how all people that are not Muslim don't realize that Muslims think this. All Muslims know suicide is a ticket to hell, and the ones that commit it are brainwashed, and the ones that teach it are not Muslim. I seriously liked how they showed how they brainwashed,There are some bad people doing things bad in name of Islam, but it is important to know they are not Muslims. In fact if you look at the history, the worst Muslims were created by the secret agencies of powerful countries. The non-Muslims are the ones who start the brainwashing of some powerful Muslims by giving them luxury and money. Then the problems roll from there. The movie showed the bad fake Shake talking to someone on the phone, this was huge, on the other line they never show it who it was, I guarantee this scene was cut out, I guarantee you a person who was not Muslim was funding the bad Shake to do this. Guaranteed. Fantastic movie." 
" Religion is perfect but not its followers..."Ya Rab" Review...","So, basically this movie is based upon the fact that Muslims are not terrorists because terrorism has no religion, no face. Previously, we have seen quite a few films like "My Name is Khan" and "Shahid" that tried to speak on such matters. "Ya Rab" may not be a typical Bollywood film but it has elements of peace, prosperity and unity with a strong message. I loved the movie for its honesty and portrayal of events and some nice performances. You might notice a few familiar faces like "Aijaz Khan" from Big Boss as ATS Officer Ranvijay Singh. Overall it is a must watch for every Muslim and Non- Muslim so that "We" both can understand each other truly and judge ourselves." 
" Film YA RAB ...........Lesson to misguided religious teaching......","This film is made through the heart and in the spirit to teach the peoples not to be misguided................This film is a genuine effort to show the truth behind all unwarranted lies related to "QURAN, Islam and MUSLIMS'' and to show them the mirror.All Maulanas and Muslim scholars who have high regards for Islam and intend for the betterment of ''Islam'' are respected everywhere.....This film is to unmask the impersonators who want to spoil the image of Islam in the name of Islam In this film there is something to be said about a film that speaks out loudly against the religion of intolerance and the culture of violence" 
" Real face of Islam Teachings","YA RAB movie showed the real Islam and misconception of word JIHAD and the way jihad word is being used in wrong way for political reasons.Al last the truth wins...Ikram (Raju Kher) is a practicing Muslim living happily with his family in Lucknow. His brother, Maulana Jilani (Akhilendra Mishra) is a much respected Muslim face. Having a huge following, the maulana gets his followers out of trouble with the authorities thus adding to his power. But the maulana's intentions are not what they seem to be. He has a sinister side to him, that of inciting mobs and spreading terrorism. He specialises in choosing boys for suicide bombing missions and brainwashes them in various ways including showing them films of atrocities against Muslims.On the tail of the maulana is the ATS cop, Rann Vijay Singh (Ajaz Khan), who has information that something is slated to happen in Lucknow on a certain date. Khan's love life has been shattered after his Muslim fiancée learnt that her brother is also a terrorist. She decides to atone for him by not marrying! Gradually,Ran Vijay has zeroed down on the maulana and worked out that a suicide bomber will destroy a crowded mall in the city. He makes it to the mall only to see the bomb going off.The bomb blast will haunt the maulana as one of the victims is his brother's pregnant daughter-in-law, Amreen(Arjumman Mughal). Ran vijay'a hopes rested on her since she was seen talking to the bomber before it went off which meant she knew him. She is the only witness to the bombing but she is brain-dead. While the surgeon Dr.Mazhar (Manzar Sehbai) wants to keep her alive till the doctors can bring the child out of her, the maulana makes all the efforts to kill her including threatening Dr.Mazhar with mob violence and destruction of his hospital."
