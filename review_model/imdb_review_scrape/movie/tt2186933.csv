" Luv (Love) the Watch Shuv (Shove) the Justifications","The movie has characters which are so accurate and genuine but then the plot has a hint of fiction in it. Had it been set on a non fictitious platform the movie could have pulled out brilliantly. Soundtracks give a good touch to the movie as it is quite slow paced and we do need something to move along. The script again could have done much more had it been tidied up a bit. Thematically its quite accurate as well with the locations. Just the fiction part ruined the perfection of the movie. The acting is good, Kunal Kapoor needs to drop the slow model walk that he does else its fine, Huma Qureshi justifies her role as a Punjaban and has done a good job, Titu mama (Rajesh Sharma) is outstanding, rest of the characters are also good. The comic punches are original, the script is refreshing compared to the run-of-the-mill fast paced comedy drama's. Watch it but don't justify it and you will surely love the Chicken Khurana that stews in the plot." 
" good one to watch !","To be honest, the story isn't the most original story out there. Then why does the film work so well? The music is great.Titu Mama is the character everyone talks about after they exit the theater and for good reason. He was too funny ! Huma Qureshi is wonderful as Harman, she did really well as a punjabi girl.Chachi was good too, small role but impact-full. If there is any character in this film who felt perfectly placed in a film like this, it would be her.Story is not that great and impressive but overall it makes us laugh a bit. Movie gives a light feel and one can enjoy watching these kind of movies." 
" delicious recipe for wholesome entertainment","I remember, once I had my privilege to taste my uncle's spicy mutton curry. It's been more than a decadeÂ…and I am yet to find the secret of the recipe and those lip-smacking flavors again on my taste buds. I am sure, you all have yours favorite too when it comes to the best of recipes, one dies to have.Debutant director Sameer Sharma's LUV SHUV TEY CHICKEN KHURANA is quite a delicious dish in terms of providing wholesome entertainment for a complete 'Indian at heart' family. It has all the vital ingredients like the most sizzling characters who sure resemble with many in your neighborhood or in the native family, aromatic locales & lingo that take you back to your roots and a perfect mix of mild-peppery-spicy moments; only thing that could make you cringe in your seats, is the preparation time to reach till its finale but trust me on this, the more you wait for the food, the better it gets in taste. You will never regret your precious time spent in waiting.At his first effort, Sameer Sharma scores big in the impressive 'slice of life' writing and the casting that never falls flat, not for once-not for even in its least significant characters. Besides the competent kunal Kapoor & huma in the lead, its veteran Vinod Nagpal, Rajesh Sharma as titoo mama, Rahul Bagga as jeet who all make it a feel-good watch for everyone in the family. Rush to the restaurants serving it or just wait to try this at home but please have it on your plate" 
" same recipe but in a new style","i just watched LSTCK.. and it was a nice movie...script was nice...and all the performances were great...but i must say best 1 was 'titu mama'.... LSTCK is very simple story but director's way of story telling was great..and all the actors including supporting actors were simply great..at first i thought that movie is a little bit slow but gradually it started to unfold in a great way......i don't remember when i last saw kunal kapoor but his performance was also good...and man i must say that huma qureshi is really a very good actress..she's just two films old and i have become her huge fan.... i recommend this movie to all this is such a light hearted comedy film.." 
" A good movie to watch after a long time. Don't miss this","This is a good simple movie after a long time. This movie gives you some gentle comedy rather than masala type comedy. The story is of a boy (Kunal Kapoor) who stole money from his Daarji (Vinod Nagpal) and went abroad. After many years he found himself nowhere and was under pressure of a local gang.He came back to India to beg/borrow/steal money from his family again. His Chacha (Rajendra Sehi) was surprised and doubted him for his return. Daarji's Chicken Khurana was known as the best Chicken but unfortunately Daarji lost his memory and he did't even tell anything about the recipe. Kunal was offered 1 crore for this recipe and this was the only hope for his money and future.Huma Qureshi has given a stellar performance. Kunal Kapoor has given a decent performance but nothing to shout about. Rajendra Sethi as his chacha is outstanding as always. Titu Mama(Rajesh Sharma)is excellent. Other supporting cast has also given their best.Music adds a lot to this movie. Music by Amiit Trivedi is stellar. The theme music of this movie perfectly suits and the background score is also very good. Songs like Kikli Kalerdi adds some good taste to the movie.Yes, it also have some cons but generally, we don't get such type of cinema in Bollywood. This Movie is a must watch for everyone." 
" Simple and Good !","Overall a good movie to watch ! Not much fun, because it has sad or emotional moments as well.Actual theme of the movie i.e. food (chicken khurana) starts in second half. If director/writer could have shown it in first half as well, then movie could be better and shorter.Leading cast Kunal was very honest to his role. Sometimes scenes are a bit longer (Editing as well), but I liked the scenes when Kunal and his 'love' were together. So, the story has a kind of small love angle as well.Rest of the casts, no matter whether it is 'mamaji' or 'buaji', all have done well ! Small brand movie, but sure to help you in smiling !" 
" Slow but sweet..watch it for Huma Qureshi though :)","There's not a lot to say here. The title as I've put it says a lot. The movie is a bit slow (thats my only critique), but worth a watch especially for those who appreciate watching scenes that depict the vast fields & the culture in a typical Punjabi home (open heart, ability to do 'jugaad', luv shuv {as the title suggests}, and wits amongst family members)...in short the typical life of Punjab (filmy style) - all these have been sweetly depicted in the movie. Further, the overall direction (as I said..surrounding the Punjabi life as has been shown), the music, the performances (though not awesome but good nonetheless) would serve you quite good. The roles I liked were the ones that brought a smile to my face..1. Huma Qureshi in her traditional attire and performing the role of lovely cute doc was something I looked forward to before entering the movie hall and I was not left disappointed. Her Wasseypur timing of dialogues and expressions are still in place and I believe this actress is sure to go long places if she continues that :) 2. Teetu mama..loved his role..won't go into details but lazyness, food & a good heart were some of the characteristics that defined it! 3. Kunal Kapoor - okay a second critique here but a minor one this time..he could have acted a lot better I felt, but you can ignore that understanding he's out back 10 years living in London in the movie and is not habituated to being a typical Punjabi while several things revolve around his mind. 4. The performances of side characters (dadaji, chachi, chacha, bhai, etc) were also good.Neways..overall, I would reiterate what the title says - its slow but yes..can be classified as a one-time watch, quite simply, for the simplicity and the sweetness depicted in it :)" 
" A Terrific Film!","'Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana' is simply A Terrific Film! The Screenplay is fabulous, The Direction is perfect & The Performances are outstanding. An Under-Rated Gem from 2012!'Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana' Synopsis: Omi Khurana's London dream has just ended. On the run from a dangerous UK gangster who he owes money to, Omi returns to his native village in Punjab, pretending to be a well-heeled London lawyer. Much has changed since Omi ran away from home a decade back after stealing money from his doting grandfather, Darji. The old man has since become senile and most importantly, forgotten the secret recipe of "Chicken Khurana" a dish that made the Khurana dhaba (restaurant) famous across Punjab. Omi's childhood sweetheart, Harman is soon to be married to his cousin, Jeet, though neither seems too happy about it. Adding to the quirkiness of the Khurana family is a free loader uncle, Titu, who once did a stint at a mental asylum. Will Omi be able to cover his deceit and lies for long?'Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana' works from start to end. The story appeals, the characters work & the overall outcome, is damn good. Sameer Sharma & Sumit Batheja's Screenplay is fabulous. It delivers a story that's different, but at the same time, endearing & moving. A special mention for the lovely dialogue. Sameer Sharma's Direction, on the other-hand, is perfect. He has handled the film like a pro, although this is his directorial debut. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are proper. Music by the supremely talented Amit Trivedi is impressive. Performance-Wise: Kunal Kapoor is delightful in the central role. Without a doubt, this is Kunal's finest performance to date. Huma Quershi is wonderfully restrained. Rajesh Sharma is incredible. What a scene-stealing performance! Rahul Bagga is highly efficient. Vinod Nagpal is very good. Rajendra Sethi is always note-worthy. Dolly Ahluwalia & Vipin Sharma are brilliant in cameos.On the whole, 'Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana' is worth a bite!" 
" An enjoyable one time watch, but not a funny comedy as promoted.","Before moving on to the review, let me clarify two major points used in the film's promotional campaign by its makers which is bound to give you a slightly wrong idea about the movie altogether.The first one being the genre of the film which was strongly promoted as a complete comedy or laugh riot on the lines of few earlier hits based on Punjabi themes such as KHOSLA KA GHOSLA, VICKY DONOR and may be OYE LUCKY LUCKY OYE too. Now yes the film is completely based in Punjab and it does have many comic touches coming at regular intervals. But still they are too less to call it a complete comedy as said in its promos. In fact the total comedy punches in the film are not more than what you have already seen in its theatrical trailers. So instead of a pure comedy, it would be better to consider LUV SHUV TEY CHICKEN KHURANA as a light comical film featuring an emotional touch of a Punjabi family and a childhood love story woven around a food theme.Secondly, coming to the film being called as "The First Food Film of India", yes its name says so and the last hour of its script also revolves around the subject. But again its first half never talks about this basic theme and the "Chicken Khurana" actually comes into existence only in its final hour. Hence if you are willing to watch LSTCK taking it as a great (Punjabi) comedy, then you might not get the same in return. But if you wish to see a decent entertaining film, taking you on a realistic tour of Punjab and its people, then you are sure going to find it largely satisfying in most of the cases.LSTCK has a nice, cool start straight away moving into a remote village of Punjab from abroad. The first half mainly deals with introducing its various characters with some perfect one liners and well chosen cast by director Sameer Sharma. And due to this superb ensemble of actors performing well on the screen, you don't mind the slow pace before the interval and keep enjoying it despite of having no mention of the actual "Chicken Khurana" in details. In short the film actually starts post intermission when the original creator of the recipe dies without saying a single word and then the leading hero thinks of discovering the dish again with his own efforts.Hence the whole drama of the film around the 'Secret Dish' unfolds in its final 45 minutes only and not before that. Still the viewer doesn't lose his interest at all because the debutant director successfully manages to keep him hooked in the other entertaining sub-plots of the film which include a childhood love angle, a hidden inter-caste marriage, a rival Dhaba Owner ready to pay anything for the 'Secret Recipe', a lazy relative who doesn't like to work, a psycho don, a fake spiritual guru and an emotional Punjabi family bonding represented with authenticity. Yet, I also found that a few characters could have been exploited more for generating a great comical touch like the Punjabi psycho don, the fake spiritual guru and the rival dhaba owner, especially in its first half. Having said that, LSTCK actually becomes a decent watch due to its superlative performances from the entire cast lead from the front by Huma Qureshi (of Gangs of Wasseypur fame) and Rajesh Sharma who are both simply outstanding in the film. If truth be told then just take out Rajesh Sharma (as Titu) from the film and see what difference he makes to the overall impact of the project clearly. The exceptional actor remains the central pillar of the script and plays it commendably. Huma once again showcases her hidden talent after GOW and her physical appearance perfectly matches the role she is given.Kunal Kapoor is pretty decent, underplaying his character well without going overboard. Munish Makhija (as the Don) remains enjoyable and Dolly Ahluwalia (as the fake spiritual guru) is a delight to watch, who ideally deserved a lot more scenes as I felt. Vinod Nagpal(as Khurana) is fine in his silent role and Rajendra Sethi is superb as the emotional uncle and so is Mukesh Chhabra as the budding property dealer. Rahul Bagga impresses being the cousin brother and both Seema Kaushal & Anangsha Biswas are great in their emotional acts. Besides I really enjoyed the few scenes of Vipin Sharma posing as the rival dhaba owner, who performs with perfection.Another ace in the film is an unconventional yet enjoyable soundtrack by Amit Trivediwhich rightly fits into the exact requirements of the film like a 'T'. One enjoys 'Kikli Kaleer Di' and "Luni Hasi' being played in the background a lot and then wishes to hear them again walking out of the theatre. And the same can be said about the Cinematography and Background Score of the film which strongly make their presence felt as you are watching it.Summing up LUV SHUV TEY CHICKEN KHURANA is not a great masterpiece made on the similar lines of many previous hits revolving around the Punjabi theme. It surely could have become the one with a better paced first half and more comical punches as expected. But still in the present version, it does turn out to be a nice enjoyable one time watch with a fresh subject, well supported by a superb cast and a catchy musical score." 
" Excellent movie,must watch","Scanning through the movies available on board,just came across this one and hadn't even heard of the name before. Decided to give it a try choosing over the typical Dabbang 2,Heroine and blah blah. In one word,the movie is excellent.It is of the genres like Phas Gaye re Obama,Tere Bin Laden,Tanu Weds Manu and the rest of, off beat types.But really well made movie. Omi Khurana has done the acting well and the storyline is also good. I like the Character of Chachi,Titu and Dadaji. Harman (Huma Qureshi)has displayed good acting skills as a doctor. It is a family movie with many light hearted scenes which make you laugh and make sad too.Story has several twists and turns and at the end all is well and there's a happy ending.The story has been well written without any gaps.Loved the movie and watched it twice even during my return journey...Superb watch and recommended." 
" A diamond in the rough","At first I found this film slightly odd .The second time , this little gem of a film , grew on me as a wonderfully eccentric , subtle comedy with well written characters .Omi Khurana ( the very handsome Kunal Kapoor ) returns from London in debt after going missing for a decade from his loving paternal grandfather's ( Daar ji - Vinod Nagpal ) ancestral home in Punjab .His return delights his paternal aunt Lata ( Seema Kaushal ) & his cousin Jeet , but is viewed correctly with quiet suspicion by his Father's younger brother , his perceptive & dignified uncle Hemraj ( Rajendra Sethi ) .Another person perturbed with Omi's return is his childhood sweetheart , Harman ( Huma Qureshi ) who is a local physician now - but at heart , is still the unpolished , delinquent school girl who's cut out of the same cloth as the shady Omi .While Omi is blase about how he left Harman , she is secretly still in love with him - an affection she is wary of & tries to curb at first , with her assessment of Omi's true character & the bad influence he wielded on her in their school days .While Omi lies about being an affluent Ferrari-driving lawyer who lives near the Buckingham palace , with the Mittals as neighbours ( a lie readily accepted by his aunt Lata , Jeet & Lata's eccentric brother,Titu - but not his Uncle Hemraj ) he conceals from his family that he's really there to rob them again to erase his debt to London gangster , Shanty .Harman's dirty-dancing brother Lovely, who runs a store selling undergarments & is trying to become a real estate agent, brings Omi an offer of INR one crore from unintentionally funny , dhaba owning rival , Kehar Singh ( Vipin Sharma ) for Daar ji's famous dhaba & the recipe for Daar ji's secret 'chicken Khurana'.Omi is stumped since the recipe is known only to Daar ji , who is now , old , adorable & recognizes no one but a crow - whom Daar ji believes , is the love of his life, his beautiful , dead wife Muskaan ( Omi's grandmother ) & keeps singing to the scruffy black crow besides absent-mindedly & hilariously , responding in 'dhaba style' to people , "tandoori or makhani ?" etc .Apart from the delightful Kehar Singh ( whose idea of insulting Lovely & his merchandise , was to call him a " kabootar " & that " 6 din mein ched ho jaatein hain tere underwear mein " ) other memorable characters are Daar ji's cousin,'bua ji' , a pot-smoking god woman; Dalidri, the loving man-servant who considers himself a family member ;
Titu Mamaji , the eccentric scooter-riding uncle who sleeps on the terrace , carries a radio , wears an undershirt everywhere , complains about his sister Lata's bad cooking & is suspicious of Jeet's sexual orientation ;Manty , Shanty's gun-wielding enforcer who follows Omi to Punjab & gets hilariously gets homesick for his 'pind' & his 'bebe'.This is a delightful film which stands up well to repeated viewings & has some ribald songs & a lovely background score. Good direction & editing. Well written script." 
" An Old recipe with new honest flavor.","This story is about a young NRI, who ran away from his home 10 years ago. He faces some problem in abroad and comes back to his family for solution. During his stay in India he realises that his family still loves him so he takes some decision as a family member.although the story is not new, but with different innocent characters and funny moments it gives you a light feeling. With Punjabi accent and desi (native) life style, one can feel that characters are neither fancy nor unreal. The acting is good. Cinematography is decent. Story pace is little slow. I specially liked amit trivedi's background score and Punjabi tracks.In short, this is a good, light, funny, family movie. This is not a typical 'masala' movie :)." 
" Surprise package","Watched this movie out of the blue, had never heard about it. What a pleasant surprise, really enjoyed. The simplicity, the light hearted humor, fact that characters are so real makes this a great watch. Such a shame this was not a bigger commercial hit, many people would have missed this little gem. I think the IMDb rating is unfair, this deserves more. Music is also very complementary and though with a distinct Punjabi flavour, some great tunes. Loved the background score in particular, really catchy in places.I don't understand the Indian public - 'bakwaas' movies like chennai express is a huge hit and genuine movies like LSTCK don't get noticed." 
" Fun movie; Punjabi gusto on display; Great acting by Huma Qureshi; Interesting story about putting love in your cooking","This is a light, happy, seemingly genuine and amusing story plucked out of everyday Punjabi family nuttiness. The story is based in UK and Punjab. The hero is forced to return to India after 10 years and is trying to wriggle out of an impossible debt to some UK Punjabi baddies.The language is specified as Hindi but there are plenty of Punjabi words everywhere, giving it an authentic Punjabi dehat (rural) flavour without overdoing it. And, there is a lot of Punjabi food. The actors seem truly Punjabi too, except Rajesh Sharma (as Titu mama) who seemed out of place with his looks.Rahul Bagga (as Jeet) (also seen in the 2010 TV serial, Powder), Vicky Kaushal the film actor, in a small flash - back role, and Vinod Nagpal (as Darji, with the long noisy farts, who is a veteran of the 1985 TV serial Hum Log, movies like Khosla Ka Ghosla!, Pink, Jolly LLB 2, and many other appearances), were a delight to watch. Kunal Kapoor (as Omi Khurana) and the hero, was not impressive.Huma Qureshi (as Harman) has acted outstandingly well...she is the star of the movie. Her every scene and frame has been done with consummate skill. She was a treat to watch. She was the wow element and made the movie worthwhile to quite an extend.The mourning scene (and the get together) was very well done.The film poster is lovely....colourful and expressive.Also good were the background Punjabi rap songs.The name given to the movie was very apt....the very words tickle and pique your curiosity.A nice story and a fun movie over all...don't miss it!" 
" A light hearted subtle entertainer.","Talk about watching movies out of guilty pleasure, "Luv shuv tey chicken khurana" definitely finds its place among them. The average IMDb score might not bode well with some people, but this is a solid movie. Even though it doesn't boast of any esteemed name or a stellar cast, the lesser known cast delivers a solid performance that makes you dwell about their normal lives and find it believable. The subtlety with which some emotional scenes are depicted garners a pat on the back for the cast and the director. It has its weaknesses though with its lead actor Kunal Kapoor delivering an inconsistent performance. His facial expressions and his words didn't seem to resonate with each other, maybe I would go as far as calling it corny. Otherwise overall a good film, left me with a good feeling." 
" Watch the movie for its characters","What a cute little love story! Watch the movie for its characters, the screenplay, the subtle funny lines, the settings! No over the top comedy, or loud over-the-top punjabi lines (even though the entire setting is in kinda rural Punjab). An absolute delight. Amit Trivedi's music is tasteful - if you have liked Sneha Khanwalker's Oye Lucky Lucky Oye music, or Dev D by Amit Trivedi, you'll find some similar feel in the music. Besides the music is so nicely weaved into the screenplay, there is no 'actors breaking into a song suddenly' kinda situation. The movie is so well cast. Fine acting by the lead pair, esp Huma Qureshi. You feel the character. Vinod Nagpal is a delight. Back in the days of Hum Log (as Basesarram), he always hummed some song. Here also he does in some scene, and thats cool. Such a well made movie."
