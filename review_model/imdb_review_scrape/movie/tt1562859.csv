" Worst movie of the year","I am not against mindless entertainers (I love One Two Three), and I was able to enjoy some moments in the previous two editions, but this movie is a complete waste of time. None of the scenes are funny and there is just no coherence, all the characters are shouting at all times and going overboard. I got a bad headache after watching it, I am glad that I didn't have to pay to watch it. Clearly worst movies of the year doesn't even deserve a 1 star. There is hardly any plot and the incessant shouting and fighting and impromptu song sequences do not help in any way.My sincerest request to the director, please don't make a Golmaal 4 and please stop abusing the name of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Golmaal!" 
" No story, stretched out comedy","Golmaal was great. Golmaal Returns was good. Rohit's next All The Best was alright. Golmaal 3 sucked hugely.Indeed, this film is not a sequel. The characters lost their history. Meh, at least you should have started with a completely new set of characters and cast. Or at least you should have renamed all the characters.The film has no story, the reason why it sucked I feel. It has more of physical comedy rather than verbal comedy unlike the previous two Golmaals. Thanks to the writers Farhad and Sajid? Rohit Shetty, you should start writing yourself for your films, because that is the reason for the success of your first two Golmaals.The first half, before the intermission was pretty good, despite a poor start. Expectations from the second half were more, but nothing such happened. Climax popped out of nowhere. Johnny Lever's character, Puppy was the saving grace.If you want to enjoy anything out of this movie, then you should keep your mind out when watching this film. The film didn't stay true to the line of the lyrics of the theme song "humne kiya tha jo waada nibhaya hai". Instead I'd say it was "tumne kiya tha jo waada nibhaya nahi."" 
" Not up to expectations","First Of all I agree with critics. According to me the first half is watchable second half I was looking towards the door for escaping out of cinema hall. The story of G-3 lacks twists n turns, gags are old fashioned. It looks like just an attempt to hit the festive market of India to get money and keep rolling.Second half lacks proper screen play, sound effects and slow motion during action sequences are boring. It looks like we are watching a 2 mins action for 10 mins that too monotonous action.Guys give me a break please have some level for throwing PJs, have a pinch of creativity to it.Best luck!!" 
" What was Rohit Shetty thinking???","Finally the much awaited Golmaal 3 released and not to my surprise it was really disappointing. Rohit Shetty might have given good comedies like Golmaal, and average comedies like Golmaal 2 and All The Best earlier, but this one was a complete let down. I should more simply put it this way that with every subsequent release, the quality of movies made by him are decreasing. There was nothing new to offer in this movie and all the jokes were old. As always, comedy in the movie was character based rather than situation based. What the director was offering was comedy which would make us laugh on characters that had something wrong with them like someone could not speak, someone stammered and someone forgot things(just like Aamir Khan from Ghajni) and there were no situations as such which made a person laugh. Even good actors like Ajay Devgan and Arshad Warsi could do nothing to save the really really weak script. As always in Rohit Shetty movies, there was a lot of noise, lot of commotion, an irritating Tushar Kapoor, some larger than life fight scenes, but no good humor this time round. Mithun Chakravarty for most part of the movie was just making painful funny faces that left one irritated. I am sure he would not want to do another movie which is even close to similar to this. The story of the movie was very predictable and I would not like to shed any light on that because that would be wasting your time. I should say that this movie did not even qualify for a brainless humor flick. For most part of the movie, everyone was fighting with each other as if they were 5th standard kids. In the end I would just want to say that by all means you should avoid this movie, and still if you are willing to see this movie, it would be on your own risk. And by the way this movie is not a sequel to the previous parts but more like an episode based on the same characters." 
" Gets you laughing or does it?","I was not a big fan of the previously released Golmaal movies but since i heard some good reviews about this one i decided to go watch it and now its more a dilemma. The movie has no proper storyline and somehow the director Rohit manages to bring all the characters together and get them dancing. Ajay devgnn like always has a larger than life appearance with his smashing entries. Mithun da was exceptional and really liked him moving his body. Shreyas was pretty OK though he seemed to try very hard to make you laugh. Arshad like always has his cheesy lines. Tushar was not very impressive and kunal hardly has much to do than listen to "Shut Up Laxman" The movie will definitely make you laugh but makes you wonder is this what a comedy flick is about?Comical masala by Jhonny lever and Vasooli bhai was appreciable and also the periodic humor added by the police offer.Kareena was very impressive and in a way gave strong support to devgann.Its not a total waste of time but i guess the director has just took the fans for granted.If you can neglect all the flaws and the major one being it has no plot you can really enjoy the movie and laugh out loud!" 
" Fun!","Golmaal is back again! 4 years ago, Golmaal created a rage of itself. 2 years ago, a slightly boring sequel released. 'Golmaal 3', turns out to be the best of the installments, as it offers laughter and emotion.'Golmaal 3' is fun from the word go. It keeps you hooked at your seat, the emotional scenes are truly wonderful. Performances and Direction add as a plus-point.'Golmaal 3' borrows slightly from Hollywood hit 'Yours Mine And Ours', but again, it is mostly a fresh fun flick. The track between Mithun-Ratna Pathak Shah is indeed wonderful, and it's indeed a treat to watch Mithunda breaking into his classic song 'I Am A Disco Dancer'.Rohit Shetty's direction is top-notch and the dialouge are simply superb. Music by Pritam is fun. Cinematography is perfect.Acting wise, Mithunda is excellent. He willingly spoofs himself from his superstar days, and gets each movement right. Ajay does very well as the hot-headed hero. Kareena plays the tomboy with ease. Tusshar repeats his act nicely. Kunal Khemu is good, while Arshad Warsi appears over-weight, but fun. Ratna Pathak Shah is lovable. Prem Chopra's cameo is a hilarious! Johny Lever as a forgetting don, is flawless and delivers the highest laughs. Sanjay Mishra and Mukesh Tiwari shine in their roles. Ashwini is decent, while Murli Sharma is in top form.On the whole, Golmaal 3 is fun, it makes you laugh and cry, at the correct places. Go have a good laugh! Thumbs Up!" 
" What/where is the point?","Hello this is Jewelraz, I am going to review this movie from my own perspective of view. I have seen Golmaal 1,2 and just finished watching Golmaal 3. It's was really exciting and joyful to watch Golmaal 1,2 but this last squeal is awful. Absolutely no story and it seems pretty boring. Also criticism is all around this movie. They have criticized Amir khan twice, Also they have stated a statement on Shahrukh Khan's Movie. Rohit Shetty(the producer) just kill some time by twisting several songs which used to be so amazing and beautiful and popular(still) in the past like Disco Dancer, Yaad A Raha hein. I mean what's the point of this movie? Can't even make people laugh, Golmaal 1 & 2 was far more better than this movie." 
" Fun and entertainment with 'Golmaal is back again!'","Golmaal is back again! This is the punch line of the movie and yeah, the real Golmaal is back after the dull sequel Golmaal 2. This time director Rohit Shetty introduced emotional sequence and no doubt they are best. The movie keeps you hooked at your seat for the full time but at the last scene you must feel that 'you need something more, something different'. From Golmaal Rohit Shetty started dumping a lot of cars in fight scene and it is still continue in 'Golmaal 3'. After 'Jab We Mate' Kareena is again in tomboy role and it just suit on her. Ajay Devgan is superb with his emotion and dialog delivery as well as in action scenes. Its really cool to see Mithun Da after a long time and with his classical song 'I am a Disco Dancer'. Tusshar worked more on his role. 'Bhula' don Johny Lever is undoubtedly hilarious and don't miss laughing all the time.Great Sequel!!!" 
" Kareena Kapoor stole the show this time, she was literally one of the boys and it's really a huge breakthrough for Bollywood where the Heroin must have a hero.","GOLMAAL 3 â€“ CATCH IT ( A ) Golmaal 3 is such a pleasant surprise and lives up to all the expectations. It's a nonstop fun like the 1st Golmaal movie. Where Golmaal 2 was all over the place and not funny enough, Golmaal 3 dealt with one story at time and put all the entertainment into one single story. I was laughing hard all the time, its literally one of the funniest movies I've ever seen where you don't have to think a lot. Ajay Devgan again proved that he is a veteran actor and whether its comedy, social or action movie, he gives his 100%. Kareena Kapoor stole the show this time, she was literally one of the boys and it's really a huge breakthrough for Bollywood where the Heroin must have a hero. She proved that she is the bestest in all contemporary heroines working in Bollywood right now. Arshad Wasi, Tusshar Kapur, Shreyas Talpade, Kunal Khemu, Mithon Chakraborthy, Johnny Lever and Ratna Pathak did a fantastic job. Rohit Shetty brought his whole gang yet again and put the Box Office on Fire. Bravo!" 
" What a sad, sad film. Ironic for a "comedy".","Regarding Golmaal... as the next one comes out, its quality goes down. Rohit Shetty thought that the formula he used in Golmaal 2 (no strong storyline, cheap, PJ humour, loose funny sequences tied together) would work in 3 as well. 2 was a hit. And I think this one will be too. But, God... why did it have to come out on Diwali? All the lights just went out.No, seriously, I swear it. I believe that what constitutes a good film, regardless of a weak storyline, bad script, everything, is if it's able to make you feel the emotions you're supposed to feel. If that happens, then the movie qualifies, because then you know it has a soul. That is exactly the reason why a non-sensical movie like Kick-Ass was a blockbuster. It made you FEEL it. Golmaal... bekaar.And to add to the fact that this film has no soul, it has a very average script, very poor music, no storyline at all, poor sense of humour, OK-OK direction. Alright, I agree that the performances were good... but what's the point trying to give your best in something, when, well, there IS nothing to give your best in! Yes, exactly, that's my point. The purpose of this film was to give bollywood its first ever trilogy, and to try to spread laughter this Diwali. But then, you only ever laugh at a good joke, that makes you FEEL itself! That is why only rare comedy's have provided genuine laugher... like Bheja Fry, Hera Pheri, etc! Even Golmaal 1 had a soul. But no, the soul preferred to leave in 2. And it didn't bother to come back for the three. I give it two stars for the two times out of I-don't-know-how-many it made me laugh, genuinely.This is the problem with Bollywood. As I've said in one of my articles on Bollywood (Quantity + Lack of Originality = Bollywood found on http://hubpages.com/hub/Quantity-Lack-of-Originality-Bollywood), there's a reason why Bollywood has produced the maximum number of films and 0 Oscars.Seriously... people need to start thinking before making a film. It's all in the mind. You have a good idea, use your mind for that, use your hand and all the greatest trained people to give that idea shape. And tell me which person calls that product bad.Move on, Bollywood. The world has. Don't get left behind. Life is, after all, despite what 3 Idiots says, "a race"." 
" A really bad movie","When Golmaal 2 was released I thought that it had devalued the brand Golmaal, but Golmaal 3 is beyond any doubt the worst of the lot. I can't imagine such a trash movie from the cast and crew of Golmaal - the original movie. Tushar Kapoor ceases being funny after an extent and the director has not realised this and has given him an extended role. The action is mindless and has been stretched too far. Ajay Devgan is such a good actor and he has been completely wasted. Humour is given to the public is very small doses. Johnny Lever is the saving grace of the movie. I don't think anyone should waste his or her money on such a waste of a movie. I am a big bollywood fan and it has happened only twice in my 25 years of life (and believe me I have seen many films) that I have wanted to leave the theatre in between a film. To some extent it is a "inspired" from Hollywood movie Yours mine and our. In all don't waste your money and time and don't go for the movie and I seriously hope that if Rohit Shetty is planning on making Golmaal 4, he comes up with something better." 
" very good","LVUWAASAAAglE+oHFnl+NwoXhNCpDSJok0l7o+4zbMfFLDbla5LKI6lR0zdzVvr8 RxYiDZUrCVZB7KFAtQFo5loFZrWM9u3j741RheTlMOtsQBW6Y7HwQ6ki5f80ZV7n a7N58ButZlPy2q2pjbkgWhCjGtQvT081rgzmzKOO0VYT5BDZtLP4Lpr6CH82WfWE ItG4PES5TgQ2iQtErjK8LOaAYNnQDRzHZtTSiCieIrN8NDEIS4SAR9dRTpDAb8Vy 9e/XY/N16NfxfSRT8HnntRva+br4llNf4wLpwkS0hy8oo8tlEPYvBTLkPS5AveMC vDIG2dk5q90u/F1HzJps8U97vEFhtzhx1/DmHFea3XkddhR/MDm4I9/Z9Bt2BUvu bZGfne0sgl4fD86B12C/xUXSbDSgbpkp" 
" Don't even bother buying a pirated copy of this film","It's a good thing that the ToI finished their city survey before Golmaal 3 was released, or else all of Bangalore would have scored a zero on sanitation. For such is the miasma of garbage that emanates from this apology of a movie.The dog, weirdly named Facebook, puts in the best performance of the film. He drools, chases Mithun on cue, bites his butt when required and generally maintains a suitably consistent expression throughout the film. But he's a dog, and there's not much else he can do with his face.Unfortunately, there is no excuse for the rest of the cast to follow in his footsteps.One of the most irritating aspects of this movie is the sameness of expression and action in almost all of the 'comedy' scenes. Even if some of the jokes are new, you get a feeling that you have heard them somewhere before, mainly because the dialogue delivery and facial expressions are so metronomically similar. The chief offender in this regard is of course Johnny Lever. In Golmaal 3, he plays what appears to be a gross caricature of the sum of all his previous roles. This would have been an interesting take on his character, if it wasn't for the fact that all his previous roles are caricatures in themselves.Throughout, the film is absolutely deluged with references to other films, previous films of this cast and in some cases other actors. This tends to pale after a while and towards the end, becomes downright irritating and of course, predictable. Mithun reprising his Disco Dancer role, complete with song and knock-kneed gyrations, is one of the few exceptions.The plot, such as it is, is nothing to write home about; indeed if one were to write home with such a plot as this, one would risk being thrown out of home permanently. Set in Goa, it's a melange of various elements: kids (I use the word loosely) not knowing they are adopted, long-lost loves who are their adoptive parents reunited (still virginal after decades, such being the power of their love), kids not getting along with each other until the shocking revelation that they are, indeed, adopted sparks a new-found camaraderie amongst them, several slapstick fight scenes and impromptu songs every now and then.How this tripe was sustained past the interval is still a mystery, because by the time the slide came on halfway through the film, it felt like I had watched two feature films already. However, the director fearlessly plods on, throwing joke after stale joke at the hapless audience. One scene in particular stands out, and while being one of the few that are remotely funny, again only serves to show how repetitive the structure of the movie is. The newly-wed 'parents' (Mithun and Ratna Pathak Shah) are watching TV while the five boys (Shreyas Talpade, Arshad Warsi, Ajay Devgan, Tusshar Kapoor and Kunal Khemu) are silently squabbling in the background. The first few scenes of "what I will shove up your ass" are genuinely funny, with the nice touch of the victims reacting appropriately to the size, shape or other characteristics of the object being threatened to be shoved. However, even this faint charm quickly pales as the scene is repeated about a dozen times, till the last of its comedic appeal has decomposed into farce.Kareena Kapoor as the irritating do-gooder with an iron hand in an iron glove (she has a couple of nice lines and almost a fight scene) plays a rare role where she has no romantic interest, save for a brief allusion to some sort of possible dalliance with Devgan. She is seen in several bedroom scenes with Shah and Mithun, the haddi to the ageing kababs. It's no wonder then, that at the end of the film, when the five 'brothers' are finally at peace with each other and she asks "Can I join your gang?" that the word "bang" closely seems to follow. Special mention must be made here of Tusshar Kapoor, who plays the mute caricature and Talpade who plays the stammering caricature. Both roles insult the real people who suffer from these disorders, but in Tusshar Kapoor's case I was glad that he did not have a proper speaking role, and it is now clear (to me, at least) why he is such an anemone in that sea of minnows called Bollywood.Overall, this is a film best watched in absentia, by which I mean that if you can pay for the tickets for someone else to go, and sit at home yourself with a cold beer and a nice book, it would be money well spent. I'm going with 1 out of 10 for Golmaal 3, and if there is any talk of Golmaal 4, I will personally free Ajmal Kasab and point him in Rohit Shetty's direction."

" Worst typical bollywood film","I purchased this movie on youtube, and believe me unable to tolerate it more than 30 min. Worst typical Rohit Shetty movie, just skip it. Better sleep for 2hrs. Will never watch any Golmaal series or Rohit Shetty directed at any cost."
