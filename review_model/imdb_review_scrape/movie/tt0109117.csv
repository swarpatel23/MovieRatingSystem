" The best Hindi comedy ever made!","There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only film!). Unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma who is Raveena's assistant/friend is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the flavour of the film! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this film time and again.P.S - For those of you who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc." 
" Funniest Indian movie of all time.","This movie is simply excellent. For some reason it wasn't a success at the box office in India. In New York, however, I have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie. This is definitely the funniest movie to come out of India.  Everyone gives a good performance; Amir Khan; however, just takes over and puts the movie over the top." 
" funniest movie of the century","There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be  box-office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. For once, an Indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churned out a Kader Khan type stereo-typical hoax. The movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. The complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the a street-smart guy, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. The villian played by Paresh Rawal,and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa" make you laugh in your sleep. Although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddy camerawork, and despite being "loud" at times, it remains one of the scarce "funny" movies Bombay has come up with after movies like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar movies. It is sad that it didn't do well at the box-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned." 
" Best Indian comedy of the Khan era!","It's simply ridiculous how underrated this movie is. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It never lags, it never slows down, it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. That along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti deliver some great bad guy comedy, but Viju Khote and the Ajit-wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad-guy intentions. If you want to laugh, and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. Most indian movies tire me out by the end, cause they are 3 hours long. This movie is just as long, but I wish there was more when it ends, cause it's an amazing flick." 
" Best Indian Comedy Ever!!!!!!!!","This is my favourite Indian movie of all time. It is comic genius. Salman Khan is hilarious. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. Karisma Kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. There is not one dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. I especially loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) 'regains his memory'. I've seen this movie so many times I've lost count. And I'm so glad to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as I know A.A.A it is not a replicate of a Hollywood movie (THANK GOD). Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi/ Urdu and loves good comedy.Watch it you'll love it!!!!!" 
" This comedy has a script !!!","Its a spoof, its an intelligent comedy, it has some a pathetic action and choreography (and mind it, it is intentional), good hummable songs, good performances by the entire cast, brilliant by Amir, Salman and Paresh and over all an script which is so rare in Indian cinema that too in comedy (watch David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra etc). Story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. They come across one such way when they find out that a rich NRI is coming India to get married. Rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other. Entire cast is perfectly cast right from Deven Verma till Viju Khote. Songs are rightly placed and are funny. Surprise package is Salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy.All an all a fum film which you should not ignore if you like and watch Indian Cinema." 
" One of the funniest movies in the last few decades. MUST SEE!","Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first  being Namak Halal (even though that was technically a drama). Story is  nothing groundbreaking, but the complications that are added to it make  it awesome. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just watch his expressions  in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is amazingly good at comedy, I  never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two  characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as Aamir's faces.  Raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. The  real pick of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual.  The plot is rather simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless  sons of poor fathers. They don't believe in hard work and just want to  get rich the easy way. So both their brains come across an idea to woo  a rich man's (Paresh Rawal) daughter (Raveena Tandon) who comes to  India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet on the trip and join  hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl.  When they succeed, they now have to get rid of each other. Somehow both  of them get into Raveena's house, Amar as an injured guy and Prem as  his doctor. From here on they try to oust each other. But things are  complicated as Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls for Prem and  pursues him. And rich man's evil twin brother (Rawal also) tries to get  rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and  sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work.  This is a movie you do not want to miss. Watch it! It will be worth it.  I even own the DVD, its that good. And if you like this movie, I'd also  recommend Gol Maal if you haven't already watched it. Other good  comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new)." 
" Most Comic movie in Recent times","Andaaz Apna Apna is the most comic movie of the decade.You can't stop laughing during the movie.Right from the first scene to the last, your giggles don't stop.Amir Khan is brilliant.His comic timing is superb.His dialogue delivery, gestures,uninhibited style all compel you to laugh like hell.Salman Khan is good.Paresh Rawal is his usual best.The dialogues by Rajkumar Santoshi are good(Amir Khan mouthing Purush-Mahapurush).The music reminds you of good old times.The scenes where both the characters Amar Prem try to outwit each other,they try to woo Raveena and the fighting scenes in the Climax are really funny.It is very difficult to decide which is the most comic scene.All of them are on top of other.Definitely one of the best feathers in RajKumar Santoshi's Cap. I think this movie ranks no.1 in Comedy genre of Bollywood(at least in 1990s when there were very few comedy movies)." 
" Best Indian Movie Ever","i have been watching this movie repeatedly, since it came out. even though it is 8 years old now, it still cracks me up. the jokes are still hilarious and the way the characters are portrayed will make anybody of any age laugh like they've never laughed before. Enjoy it" 
" Brilliantly Marvellous","Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I treasure and its one movie, I don't mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! This movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I do put it over Hera Pheri... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes you'll watch out but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! Aamir & Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but I'll put the characters in order of favoritism: Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew but for Mogambo, he's more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. Gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (who is as Balla had once said, "A Fraud and a Cheat!"). Now, Gogo's only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, Gogo realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... Gogo's struggle against the sinner-world.Rank # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is Ram Gopal Bajaj's twin. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness, instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's Dad), though Teja doesn't regret his actions. Teja's sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own Poultry & Bakery Farm. Teja also needs to return back the loan to Gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). In order to achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!) Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for Mumbai. Amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveena's father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to London, if needed.Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.I won't reveal any more characters because Jesus Christ! I just wouldn't stop typing! The movie is outright stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final encountered between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. It teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask Prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where Salman is targeted by Aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to London and the part where Gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!The movie was considered a flop back then and I bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling Home DVDs and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!" 
" Hilarious...","It'll soon be 10 yrs since this movie was released....still makes me laugh.... If u enjoy this film, try the new Hera Pheri....t'is as hilarious. And my favourite bit of the film must be when Salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point...and he actually says it out loud!!! U just wanna bash him....but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing!!!! Fantastic film.... 10/10" 
" Humor differs with culture, quality clearly not","This top 250 2016 film might be considered funny depending on your sense of humor. On the other hand, the story, script and acting does not match a IMDb top 1000 quotation. Almost three hours is too much for the simple story, the over the top acting, the odd sound effects, etc.. Most of all, the acting of main actor Aamir Khan is far over the top and can become annoying. If you want to see a good Indian movie, do yourself a favour and look at the film's average score of the top 1000 users/scorers at IMDb." 
" Woeful - Carry on Film style comedy at best.","Over the last year or so I've been attempting to watch my way through the IMDb top 250, and as a result have watched several Indian movies due to a recent influx of films to the list. While some films have been good (Lagaan, Drishyam, Gangs of Wasseypur as examples) there are those such as Andaz Apna that are woefully lacking in merit to be rated as highly as they are. The story line, filming style and sense of humour are akin to the British Carry on movies only with more musical interludes and an extra hour in length. The story line sees our two main characters competing for the love and affection of a wealthy heiress who has recently returned from London. What follows is a series of attempts to get close to her all the while inadvertently avoiding and preventing the death/capture of the girl by an evil criminal! Sounds ridiculous? that's because it is! It's certainly not all bad and there are some moments of humour and slapstick that do raise a smile and there are little parts of the story that are inventive. However overall this film lacks enough genuine laugh out loud moments and there is little to hold the attention throughout, especially when there are some clear directions the story is going in but it leaves you waiting and waiting before they materialise on screen.Don't base this film on a sole judgement of Indian movies, I know a number of people are unhappy at the inclusion of several 'overrated' movies in the IMDb Top 250 however it isn't the whole story, other Indian movies do warrant their inclusion, unfortunately Andaz Apna isn't one of them." 
" One of the best comedy movie ever made in Bollywood","The movie Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy movies ever made in Bollywood perhaps even Hollywood. When the movie released i was a 8 year old and I heard it was a flop but I never understood till now why was it a flop...but let me tell you one thing...this movie would have more money by selling home Cassettes and DVDs and by showing in TV movie channels than any hit movie in theaters. This movie has been shown countless times in Movie channels and I think even now the public love and the TV producers keep repeating the movie again and again. I personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 -100 times and I still love it.....The performance by both Aamir khan as Amar and Salman khan as Prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of Aamir khan as a street smart guy....his dialogs in the movie are Hilarious... the story is simple and heres how it goes.....Amar and Prem are poor , lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and Amars father is a barber. Then they both get a news that a Millionaire 's daughter from London is coming to India to look for a suitable match ...both Amar and Prem think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich.....therefore they both head out to woo Raveena Tandon..(the millionaires daughter)......in their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry Raveena.....the comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing.......and then there is Raveenas Uncle (Millionaire's look alike brother) Teja who wants to take revenge from Raveenas father.....since he is broke and Raveenas dad is a millionaire......his plans include kidnapping Raveena to blackmail Raveenas dad for which he hires 2 butlers.....but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie (watch the movie to know).......then there is Shakti Kapoor as crime master Gogo who is also incredibly funny......The thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sorts.....Aamir khan uses his "aaila " brilliantly and Salman goes like "OOima "........and for Gogo there is " Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega" ......each and every scene is so funny......I especially liked the one in which Aamir khan and Salman goto get Raveena from Teja and they both go in a Luna having "chillar" money in a bag....that scene is so funny..I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ......this is one movie that I would recommend having a DVD and you will never regret......." 
" Ha..ha..haaa.haa..","This movie is an amazing comedy.. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. Though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh!! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their roles. After 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this." 
" AAA: Another Awful Atrocity","Andaz Apna Apna might well prove how bland, unoriginal and unfunny Indian humor is. Throughout I couldn't help myself but to think how anyone could find this funny in the slightest. The acting, amongst the story are plain and boring, and the whole film is an extremely unnecessary 2 and a half hours. Andaz Apna Apna may go down a the worst movie in the IMDb top 250. For anyone that is crusading to complete the list, you may have the unfortunate time to have to view this film. Why it has been rated so high is well beyond me, but it is there for now. One of the worst films I've ever seen, alongside Superbabies."
