" A pornography video shot on a married couple's honeymoon - based on a true story, an educational film","A movie worth watching. Unlike typical Hindi movies, this one is based on the most rising crime in contemporary India ... crime of shooting pornography films of oblivious married couples and circulating them illegally. This movie is fast paced and goes directly to its point. It revolves around aspects that is the most important for the audience to know. Aspects such as, what kind of people are involved in the business, what makes it successful, the reasons for such video production, success and so forth. An educational movie, I would say. Besides, it is a decent entertaining movie as well. The series of events and its strong bond to reality makes it worth watching. I mention its bond with reality because most of us refuse to face certain facts of our life and live on with it. This movie definitely highlights the life of a person who lived a life most of us do and the emphasizes on how he fought for reality and tried to make his life worth living even after all the difficulties he goes through. Well directed, inspirational, educational and entertaining. A must watch!" 
" very very good movie","This movie is very good and one of the main reasons I wanted to watch this movie was that I wanted to hear the last song at the credits. I was surprised to:I expected Emran Hashmi to be the bad guy in the movie because in the other movies I've seen with him in he is the bad guy. It takes up real life issues about a man battling a porn website and the people who run it. Good scenes of violence. 10/10 is my rating for this movie, it is very good. I wan't disappointed at all, it is a great movie. Buy and watch it. You will not be disappointed at all. It has some funny bits in too so it is humorous. 10/10 is the good rating for this movie." 
" Sharp, Fresh and Memorable","Kalyug is one of those films that despite being better than 95% of Hindi films, was never going to do amazingly at the box-office simply due to the unknown lead cast, the theme of pornography and very confusing trailers that did nothing to entice viewers.The plot, starts off like a superspeed version of a typical Hindi film, ie: boy (Kunal) meets girl (Renuka), they fall in love, get married etc, but then comes the twist...In a midnight police raid, the newlyweds are arrested and interrogated separately about a video that has been released on the internet of their honeymoon night, police coercion tactics leading Renuka to believe that her husband is a sleazy pornographer, she commits suicide leaving her completely innocent husband distraught.Whilst out on bail, he manages to track down the creep responsible for the hidden camera in the hotel room (played by Ashutosh Rana), during the ensuing fight, the sleazeball loses his bag, which he leaves behind as he runs off onto a moving bus.Kunal finds in the bag, a large amount of cash, more videos of hidden camera porn and information related to a porn website being operated from Switzerland that specialises in this type of content hosted by an Indian pornstar "Annie" (Deepal Shaw). Kunal then flies off to Switzerland to settle the score. (Using some of the money from the bag... other reviewers seem to have been confused by this!) In Switzerland, he visits a sex shop to try and get some information about the pornstar "Annie" (Deepal Shaw), here he meets Emraan Hashmi, who works in the shop simply because they pay him... it's pretty much his take on life, "do anything for money". Unsurprisingly Kunal hires Emraan to help in his search for the people behind the website.We find out that Deepal Shaw's character is another victim of the porn industry as she was SOLD into it by her extended family in the aftermath of the Gujarat earthquake (another point that a few reviewers don't seem to have understood!) So now obviously we have the set up for the grandstand finale between the good and the bad.Amrita Singh is brilliant as the evil mastermind behind the website, her performance is outstanding as are many of the lines she is given. I won't give away exactly what happens with the ending, but needless to say, justice prevails! The movie may be a bit too long (a couple of Deepal's songs could really have been cut altogether), but then with Jiya Dhadak Dhadak and Aadat on the soundtrack, it's not possible to say the music was bad! Emraan's character is ripped off Joaqin Pheonix in the much darker "8mm", but I am definitely not saying the movie/plot is a copy, it clearly isn't! I recommend this to any fan of Hindi cinema who is looking for something that is truly a bit different." 
" social thriller, entertaining potboiler that sans little logic","Well this is 1 hell of a ride. Love the dark cinematography, Gothic setting n style of sin city...Amazing backdrop of Switzerland, could have added more scenes there though, since the film was so short, barely 2 hrs.Minuses include the money logic of how Kunal landed with that much money to do all he did. And of course, this film follows the commercial bollywood route of a masala potbolier with few distinct villains to fight when pornography as a whole has many many operatives.So its basically a fictional account of a site called indiapassion.com and its widespread.Good entertainment, thought-provoking and more films like this should be made to create awareness and reach out to the public via its commercial elements. The kissing scenes of the first night scene could have been avoided though." 
" Real, every day issues.","A good film which brings out the real issues in the real world. It incorporates situations that occur in every day life, which can affect a persons reputation and character in a negative way.personally I have heard and witnessed several mobile phone video clips which are personal to the individual exploited and published without the consent of the people in the video or who made it.People who run these porn sites should not be doing these kind of things and this film shows, how greatly it can affects a persons life......even to the extent of committing suicide or even taking an oath of vengeance.Overall, a good film which people in the real world and this generation can relate to. i.e. modern technology is getting more advanced as we speak. Cameras can be hidden in any everyday devices.Beaware people." 
" A great movie based on worldwide issues.....that does need improvement","This movie in my opinion, was great. KUNAL KHEMU makes an awesome adult debut and does it very well. His looks, acting, and hair just stole my heart. Yes, there were a few flaws in the movie that did not make sense; but the movie was good nevertheless.To begin with, KUNAL DARR (kunal khemu) is an ordinary guy who lives with his father. One day, he hears a shocking news that his father had expired in a train accident. He later starts working in a gym. One day, he receives a phone call. The caller, mistakingly thought that he was his father and told KUNAL that he had to pick up Renuka (SMILEY SURI). KUNAL tries to explain but it doesn't work.Nonetheless, he goes to the train station to pick RENUKA up and eventually brings her home. In one week's time, the two fall in love and get married. In the day of their marriage, KUNAL's friend gives him an invitation to spend their honeymoon in a hotel. Hence, the couple spends the night in the hotel, and unfortunatelytheir romance is caught in tape and made into a blue-film by hidden cameras. KUNAL and RENUKA are later arrested and charged for making blue-films. Unable to bear the embarrassment and confusion, RENUKA commits suicide in front of KUNAL'S eyes and he is terrified. KUNAL is now terrified. He explains to his lawyer his story and is able to get a bail. There, he seeks vengeance. Several clues leads him to Sin City, Switzerland. He encounters ALI (EMRAAN HASHMI) and hires him to find a porn star named ANNE (DEEPAL SHAW), whom he saw in the blue-film. However, after he finds her, he comes to know that she is a victim herself by the porn industry. After an earthquake in Gujarat (which was a stupid idea), she comes to live with her uncle. Her uncle sold many things to feed themselves. When it came to a day when there was nothing else to sell, he sells ANNE. She was forced into selling her body and doing other tragic things. With the help of ALI and ANNE, will KUNAL be able to capture the villain and the person who destroyed his love? What will happen to ANNE? What will happen to KUNAL? What will happen in the end? Well, watch the movie to find out. The performances by KUNAL was amazing for a newcomer. He really deserved best debutant award, but it was a hard decision since SHINY AHUJA also debuted in the same year. However, KUNAL KHEMU does have to work in his speech skills and his accent does have to be a little better. But, he sounds cute, nevertheless. SMILEY SURI is barely there, but does OK with the part she is given. For some reason, she looked bad in the film. DEEPAL SHAW is average, she plays her part well enough. AMRITA SINGH was fabulous. She looked so professional and acted great as the villain. EMRAAN HASHMI did good as well in his small sweet part. HE made the movie better to watch.Now, here comes the errors. In the movie, KUNAL is portrayed as a not-so-rich and ordinary guy. However, despite this how is it that he is able to hire a lawyer? Pay for RENUKA's tickets? Hire ALI? Give ANNE money? And the money was a big amount. This was the part that did not make sense.THE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!! It was wonderful. I just loved ADAAT (both remix and original). ATIF ASLAM is just great. JIYA DHADAL DHADAK JAYE is also marvelous. RAHAT FATEH ALI KHAN is just amazing.OVERALL, I give this film a 8/10. IT'S A MUST WATCH. P.S. PEOPLE BEAWARE. THERE ARE HIDDEN CAMERAS IN ALMOST EVERYWHERE THESE DAYS." 
" Promising Theme... Disappointing movie","A newly wedded couple caught on camera during their honeymoon in a hotel. Their porn videos are released on the net... The girl commits suicide and the guy wants revenge on the people... A movie that deals with Pornography, which according to its promoters is a 1.56 billion dollar. Exceptionally brilliant music--- Jal's Aadat and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's Jiya Dhadak Dhadak. All seemed so well and perfect that anybody, just like me, would get motivated to watch with this movie which deals with the pornography industry. So one fine Saturday, I get the DVD, play it and guess what??? BANG! The movie's a complete disaster! Its not like the movie's that bad as I felt about it but its just that the writer (Mahesh Bhatt) and the director (Mohit Suri) needed to do a lot more homework than what they actually did while making this movie. This movie could have been great had the script not have so many loops and holes in it.I mean picture this- A guy who is so poor that he works in a gym as a trainer and gets such a low salary that he lives in a one-room flat. After getting married to the girl he falls in love with (whose entry itself is very stupid), he cannot to afford to spend one night in a hotel and his friend actually pays for his stay with his wife for their honeymoon but bang bang! When the guy gets trapped in the porn controversy and is labelled a porn star, he has enough cash to get himself a lawyer and guess what? He can go to Switzerland (Mr. Director, care to explain how?_ on his own expense and after reaching there he hires a guy Ali (Emraan Hashmi) who's a pimp (yes, he has enough cash to hire the guy).Other than that, Deepal Shaw is another pain and it only feels great to see she's not getting any more work. Her story of how she became a porn star is funny as hell! Ashutosh Rana is completely wasted and so are the beautiful numbers, Aadat and Jiya Dhadhak Dhadhak and for die hard Jal fans (like me) it was way too irritating to see Mr. Bhatt waste another good track in a shady film.Other than that, Amrita Singh carries the film entirely on her shoulders with a lot of help from the music. Kunal Khemu is a good actor but for some reason, just doesn't have that much needed charm which is needed in a leading man.Mohit Suri's sister is there because she's Mohit Suri's sister even if she does look like a man who needs to shave! Wonder why they took her! Emraan's character was forcefully pushed into the script (just like Shahrukh's was in Shakti) and it very much shows on screen. However, its Emraan whose entry adds that zing to the movie and makes it watchable till the end. Had they worked harder on the script before getting the movie rolling and had they chosen someone else to play Kunal Darr's character, this movie could have made it to the list of some of the greatest movies produced by the Bhatt camp. A great plot badly written with mixed performances and great music end up making an overall average movie which you wouldn't regret nor cherish watching." 
" modern times : fresh films","dear movie lovers. before i write something about this film, i have to say: i hope that this is not a remake of some other American movie, i have'not seen. it would be a shame because of it's freshness.OK let's talk about this film. the story is about " human-trafficking" a very delicate subject especially in Asia. you have to approach a story with such a heavy subject in a subtle way.the story is actually divided in three chapters. the first and the last are simply amazing. chapter 2 lacks the subtle way a little.but why complain , this is a heavy duty subject, packed in a exceptional- entertaining way without getting ridiculous, with a brand new actor who can be measured with the likes of keanu reeves or Orlando bloom. And one of the finest villains i have seen in along time.its fresh its modern see this one" 
" Good story, weak execution, appreciable effort","So, here you get Hindi cinema's take on the pornographic film industry. Another film which tries to explore the dark side of society, but unfortunately without great success. Mahesh Bhatt is the one responsible for this story, which is said to be based on a true incident which inspired him back in time. Generally, when Bhatt tries to take a short break from his routine job of mostly ripping off foreign movies, he does a lot better. He definitely does better this time, but the script is still quite poor and many flaws can be spotted from time to time. The direction of Mohit Suri is very faulty. Actually I quite liked Woh Lamhe, which was fairly enjoyable and well-acted, but here the execution is too weak and simplistic. The result is a film that is more of a mediocre potboiler which looks like another clichéd revenge saga. It is not that bad though, because the film is quite entertaining at times and it definitely has its moments, but as an issue-based film, it is hardly convincing.The moments that I liked in the film include mostly the sequences involving Kunal and Renuka. Later on, with the entrance of Mrs. Simi Roy, there are some interesting sequences which later fade. Kunal Khemu, who was a fantastic child actor mostly in Bhatt productions such as Zakhm, makes his debut as a leading man. Ironically, he still looks very young for the part and so the credibility is reduced, but then he is very competent where only acting is concerned, and does very well throughout. Amrita Singh, too, returns to movies after a long period, and expectedly she is quite terrific as the devious and greedy Simi, effectively creating a vicious persona and rising above the script with her presence, which remains as strong as it used to be. The supporting cast includes many actors, most of whom are terrible. Anu Malik's soundtrack, however, is one of the best things about the film. Kalyug is overall an above average movie at best, but the effort is appreciable." 
" One of better films by Bhatt camp though a bit flawed","Bhatt films are known for their skin but many times they do have good stories which may not be original but yet must admit they are at times good films like Gangster. Kalyug which released alongwith the trash by YRF Neal N Nikki and EK AJNABEE which did average business, Kalyug performed better but not much as expected. The film is set in the porn industry and the main story does seem real especially the problems in Kunal's life. The film starts off as a routine love story with songs but changes geers effectively, the shocking twist is well handled, Kunal's search for justice may seem filmy and hard to digest but it's well handled. Amrita Singh's scenes are well handled too.Emraan's character may seem filmy but it does seem vital in the plot. The way Kunal goes about in Zurich may not seem real enough but yet for the vendetta it seems well handled, however Ashutosh Rana's profile does seem inconsistent. The pre-climax is well handled and also the climax.Direction by Mohit Suri is good Music is decent, Jiya Dhadak is seeped in melody and made Rahat Fateh Ali Khan a noticeable face after Paap, Jhuda Hoke is a nice number though copied from Jal with rights unlike Chocolate.Kunal Khemmu seen as a child artist and known for his performances in Zakhm is superb in his main role, his expressions, dialogue delivery and everything is topnotch though he did look a bit too skinny for his debut yet a great performance for a debut. Smilie Suri is okay, Deepal Shawl is raw but leaves a mark Emraan Hashmi does a good supporting act, Amrita Singh made an effective comeback though at times she does ham it up Ashutosh Rana has an ill defined role but does a good job Rest are okay." 
" This movie certainly belongs on Lifetime","No, I didn't watch it there, but that is where it belongs.It could have been shortened at least a half an hour by taking out all those love songs and walking through the field or on the beach, but I guess that's Bollywood.I watched it because the lead (Kunal Khemu) came from Kashmir after terrorists threw out his family and ended up in Mumbai. A timely story, but he wasn't fighting terrorists, he was searching for those who took pictures of he and his wife on their honeymoon and plastered them on the Internet. No, you won't see anything - they don't even kiss on screen.But, we do get a little samurai action towards the end as one man finds his conscience. Of course our hero destroys the porn business, releases all the girls, and rides off into the sunset with the star (Deepal Shaw)." 
" Promising yet disappointing","With the theme centering on the porn industry and probably inspired by real-life events in New Delhi where short sexual clips (of unsuspecting couples) were circulated via MMS, the movie starts off with a lot of promise.The Bhatt camp has often taken upon itself to make movies with bold and daring themes and this is certainly one of them. However, there are more holes in the script, plot and narration than a wedge of Emmenaler cheese. Logic takes a back seat while the story moves towards the end via any road that the director seemed to find convenient as he was shooting it.With far too many of these to recount, the only thing one is grateful about is that its a short movie.The saving grace is the acting of Amrita Singh (a brilliant comeback), Emran Hashmi & Kamal Khemu in patches. Deepal Shaw manages to keep the same expression on her face whenever she appears on screen. The song "Jhalak Dikhla Ja" is absolutely brilliant and worth listening to over and over again." 
" Good subject with good songs but weak direction!","Well, Kalyug is definitely a hard hitting subject which has been dealt with a decent direction , but not really exciting direction. The star cast is decent with Kunal showing some good potential, amrita Singh in a good negative character of the porn queen who wants to be numero uno in porn industry replacing Hustler and Playboy. But the lady shows more of hungry and lust full character with a weird sense of business. Hmm , this really doesn't show much talent of the director . deepal shaw is good till the moment she is exposing herself and is keeping quiet. The other actress , if I am not wrong her name is similie is good looking , may be she can get work in another few movies. A surprise package is apna desi porn star Imraan Hashmi , who looks at least better than his previous sex flicks and extra marital saga as he doesn't get a chance to lock lips with any of the ladies in this film and try some piece of acting. The songs are really the pull factor of movie as one doesn't want to leave chair while the songs are being played on. Songs are in fact , the strongest point of any movie from bhatt camp. Overall, the movie can be watched in spare time and its not really bad, I mean you can have at least have break even on the ROI (return on investment )."
