" A surefire benchmark","Indian film industry is the most prolific in the world and yet very few of our movies make their mark on the global scale and I am not talking about the financial aspect of this industry but the lack of imagination and finesse. Hence the Indian masses cannot be blamed for their taste in cinema simply because they have rarely been exposed to truly magnificent cinema.This is partly because most of the commercial movies are profit-centric as they ought to be but these movies revolve around a nucleus of a few 'stars' and the producers bank on these 'brand-ambassadors' to make the movie click; plus the profit from the sales from the movie soundtrack is a very crucial part in the success of a movie and this incumbency on songs is unparalleled which leads to so many abrupt speed breakers in the narration of a story so that these songs can be accommodated. And it works sometimes but the calamity is that every movie is focused around the same philosophy.This movie stands apart because it does not fall prey to any of the above. There is no 'brand ambassador' for this movie. The forte of this movie lies in its simplicity, sincerity and substance and much of that credit goes to the director Divakar Banerjee.At the crust of the movie are two of the finest actors in the country today; Anupam Kher as the ordinary middle class fifty six year old man (Khosla)in Delhi whose only drive in life is to build a new house for his family that has his wife (Kiran Juneja), his elder son Balwant(Ranveer Shourie), his second son Chirounjilal aka Cherry (Parvin Dabas) and his daughter. Balwant is a jobless waster and Cherry works for an MNC but wants to leave the country for a better job in America.Navin Nishcol (Bapu) and Vinay Pathak (Asif Iqbal) are also assets to this movie.Boman Irani(Khurana) is a very wealthy and sly business man who captures the plot of land that Khosla had bought for building his dream house. Now if Khosla wants the plot of land that belongs to him he must buy it from Khurana, the problem though is that he doesn't have the money as he spent his life's savings to buy that plot of land. This movie is about how an ordinary middle class old man tries to reclaim his stolen (robbed) dream back from the powerful clasps of this crooked property dealer.The film looks real. Actors don't wear designer costumes, there are no exquisite locations but what it does have is ingenuity and a sense of realm. The movie does not focus on a couple of 'brand ambassadors' but does justice to characters and all the actors have done a commendable job in keeping it real. The characterization is superb. The dialogues are witty and have a subtle Indian flavour in them. It also has a hint of dark sense of humour. The opening scene is funny but is inconspicuously and heavily sarcastic which is excellent dark comedy material. You will see many of those in the movie. I would agree that Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron is an excellent reference point.The movie does not exaggerate and neither does it take itself lightly. There are many scenes in the movie that manifest the problems of the common man who lives a mundane life and is helpless. Those who watch movies are these common men and they would love to see something that they can relate to.The best Hindi movie that I've seen since Lagaan. Will remember it for is originality, sarcasm and its intrinsic common man appeal." 
" Bollywood at its BEST!!","After Lageraho Munnabhai...Bollywood could not have got any better than...THIS. All along these years, we've been watching films that crawl without any story or soul...only effort going into them being a good make up in terms of ostentatious song and dance routines only to make it more sale-able. and all these years, even I've been watching all this. Appreciating some...sulking at others, craving for the movies as they were in times of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Sai Paranjape. Khosla Ka Ghosla comes straight out of that genre and sweeps you like gust of fresh air. Since most of you must be knowing the story, and for those who don't, they must be going and watching this at all cost, Khosla Ka Ghosla is one of the finest examples of storytelling in recent times. Every character is sketched out so immaculately that for even a second you can't say that you don't know this person in real life.An absolutely brilliant background score makes this movie a thorough joyride with the highs and troughs dealt with extreme intelligence.As for the performances, we know what Anupam Kher is capable of and Boman Irani is definitely a class apart. Navin Nischol, in spite of his personal troubles, makes a very impressive comeback. Kiron Juneja is very good. Parvin Dabas and Tara Sharma give perfectly restrained and energetic performances respectively.But the one who takes the cake away for my money is the support cast lead by Ranvir Shorey... Every time he opens his mouth, he leaves you in splits....and mind you...no slapstick there...everything very common...very everyday like... but brilliantly delivered. His chemistry with Vibnay Pathak in The Great Indian Comedy Show seems to have rubbed off onto KKG too and both give absolutely mesmerizing performances along with the rest of the cast.Every scene, every dialog...gives you a great sense of happiness...which you might not identify then and there itself in the theater, as in the case of Lageraho Munnabhai, but you'll definitely ponder over it and a smile will cross your face even after you've come out of the theater and it will stay with you for a long long time.Brilliant piece of Cinema...Go watch it!!!!Nine and a half on Ten!!!" 
" Outstanding!!!","Khosla ka Ghosla is one of the best films in 2006. But because of its simple cast, it has been underrated and has not got the recognition it deserves. In fact, before I went for the movie, I myself thought that this was a bore. It is a beautiful and realistic film. There is simple humour, which just helps in 'digesting' the plot. The good thing is that all the actors, (even the ones speaking just one or two dialogues) give a superb performance. Anupak Kher acts really well. I have no words to describe Boman Irani's acting. He is amazing. he just does not act the same in any movie. I also liked Navin Nischol's acting a lot. Apart from that, Parvin Dabas, Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey give terrific performances. Dibakar Banerjee has directed the film beautifully. It is beautifully paced. Every scene is an important scene in the film. It is not dragged. As far as music is concerned, music is not really needed. But I think Bapi-Tutul and Dhruv Dhalla gave superb background score. KKG just reinforces the fact that there is no dearth of acting talent in India, just that one must not go for a film just because it has a star cast. A star would have taken the simplicity of the film. In short, KKG is an awesome film, and one which everybody will relish." 
" Khosla Ka Ghosla is an appetizing pure vegetarian thali in the age of non-veg junkies. Go relish it!","How many times have you come across a film that makes you smile while you have a lump in your throat at the same time? Such are the dwellers of this nest that you feel sorry for them for the trouble they land themselves into but such is the treatment of the film that rather than being a compulsive tearjerker it has that feel good effect on you (without being overtly mushy either).Never since the times of Sai Paranjpe or Basu Chatterjee has one come across as authentic portrayal of the middle-class in films as you get to see here. Khosla Ka Ghosla talks about a family in Delhi headed by Mr. Khosla (Anupam Kher) who invests all his life's savings to buy a plot on which he dreams of building his own bungalow. But after buying the plot he finds the land being encroached by a builder Khurana (Boman Irani). He uses paisa, pehalwan and politics to get his land back but is too diminutive in front of the mammoth Khurana. Finally the straightforward family attempts devious ways to get back their land.Despite the film being delayed for long, the narrative still comes out as fresh and original. An average audience can so much relate to the characters of the film since none of them play the conventional larger-than-life Bollywood hero but a common man. Where else can you find the male lead of the film (Parvin Dabas) with a name that goes as Chiraunjilal? Kiran Juneja playing Khosla's wife, in her minuscule bit, is such a refreshing change from the sugar sweet Farida Jalal or the melodramatic Reema Lagoo kind of on screen mothers. Or for that matter Ranvir Shorey as the elder brother isn't the usual dominating or over-protective type clich√©d character.The scenes that unfold come out so much out of real life situations. The only inspiration that the film derives is from real life. The semi-autobiographical script by Jaideep Sahni is original, amazing and entertaining. Debutante director Dibakar Bannerjee extracts fine performances from every member of the cast and never lets anybody go overboard or under-act. The comic timing of the characters is simply flawless. The theme of the film might be a serious issue but the treatment is very light-hearted. Songs are restricted just to the background and Kailash Kher's 'Chak De Phatte' gels perfect with the proceedings. The background score attributed to Boman Irani's character, every time he enters the scene, needs a special mention.Post Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Maara, this is Anupam Kher's best performance. He has performed such common man characters before and plays his part effortlessly even here. From Munnabhai MBBS, Being Cyrus to Khosla Ka Ghosla, Boman Irani perhaps is the only villain who can successfully add a natural comic effect to negative characters. Parvin Dabbas, Vinay Pathak, Navin Nischol and Kiran Juneja are apt in their roles. Ranvir Shorey plays the most hilarious comic characters to have come out in recent times without being goofy at any time. The actor is simply amazing.Khosla Ka Ghosla is an appetizing pure vegetarian thali in the age of non-veg junkies. Go relish it!" 
" Realistic Entertainer","Last night I woke up at 8.30 in the night after sleeping for like 6 years at a stretch after the overnight stay me and my friends had. 9 PM. On air is "Khosla Ka Ghosla". Now I really wanted to watch that movie when it was released but just didn't had the time to and right now, I wasn't in the mood for it but since nothing else on TV was worth a watch, I decided to see the film.After a while I realized that 40 minutes had gone by and not for one moment did I feel that KKG had a scene so far which was boring or unnecessary. KKG is truly gripping. It sucks you into it and you'll start getting concerned about Kamal Kishore Khosla (Anupam Kher). Khosla is a very innocent middle-class service man who gets a plot of land from Kishan Khurana (Boman Irani) out of his life-savings, a lump amount of 30 lacs but things get terrible when Khurana doesn't exactly let Khosla get the land until Khosla would pay Khurana another 10-15 lacs.As much as I would love to say that Khosla Ka Ghosla was a movie which belonged to Anupam Kher and Boman Irani, I cannot deny that it belonged to the other artists as well. What I like so much about Khosla Ka Ghosla is that it does not star big mainstream artists in it except Boman Irani & Anupam Kher and if it did, maybe it would have lost its simplicity. Anupam Kher has been doing really lesser number of roles as compared to what he used to in the 90s but after Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara, Kya Kool Hain Hum and Rang De Basanti, Kher almost steals the show again. Khosla Ka Ghosla is very very realistic and that is its USP. Of course there are a few little flaws in the script but that does not stop KKG from becoming an entertaining ride without moving away from the realistic world. The brand of humour used in the movie is simple and enjoyable and one thing which I liked very much about this film is its characterization, I cannot deny that I liked every character present in the movie and it felt that they were straight out of someone's lives. Although Khurana and his assistant reminded me of Lucky Singh & Kuku in Lage Raho Munnabhai bit, basically because of the role they played.Boman and Anupam of course do play the parts beautifully but one performance which I liked a lot was that was Bappu's (Navin Nischol). Now what Bappu is doing in the film, I cannot say because I feel that would give out a part of the story. Ranvir Shorey and Vinay Pathak come together again after they did once in Jism. Ranvir as Anupam's elder son and Vinay as the guy whom Boman had betrayed play their parts with ease and rock it. Tara Sharma's accent is weird but I liked her here and the director gets credit for that. Parween Dabas too... actually its not the actors that are there but the characters. Such is the magic of d√©butante director Dibakar Banerjee and writer Jaideep Sahani. Full marks to the director who's earned my respect.The music by composers Bapi, Tutul and Dhruv too is great. "Chakk De Phadde" sung by Kailesh Kher which is also the OST of the movie is nice and totally in mood of the film. The other tracks too offer great help in carrying the story forward.When Anupam Kher had said that this is a tribute to Hrishikesh Mukherjee's film-making style, I'm sure he truly meant it. Khosla Ka Ghosla is simple, innocent, realistic and entertaining. Go watch it if you want to see a quality film. Much better than the Karan Johar or Rakesh Roshan flicks which are recognised by Filmfare, not for their creativity but commercial success. Khosla Ka Ghosla made my mood. Three cheers to the movie! 7.5/10 from http://muviegeek.blogspot.com" 
" Awesome......a must watch after Hera Pheri","This is the best comedy movie I have seen after Hera Pheri. Very few comedy movies make it to my list of all time favorite which include stellar classic comedy movies like Jane Bhi Do Yaroon, Andaz Apna Apna, and Hera Pheri. And this movie deserve to be on the list. Pure clean comedy movie. Not a single dull boring moment. Such a movie which every Dilliwala (Delhi-ite) can relate to one way or the other.And the best part is authentic Dilli ki (Delhi's) language and amazing comic timing of each and every character. As always Ranveer Shori and Vinay Pathak are at their best. From that Haryanvi jaat to locales of Dilli to the wearing off paint of houses to police's attitude. Every thing is so real. I have no words to describe but to say thanks to the director, cast and crew for an amazing work they have done." 
" A slice-of-life comedy","Khosla ka ghosla is a movie that gives you a bit of masala and a bit of realism all packed in a single movie. There is conventional Hindi movie stuff like background love angle, family ties, revenge, predator-become-prey .. and then there is Ram Gopal Varma type realism .. and what you get at hand is a hilarious movie with awesome performances from everyone.The movie revolves around a typical middle-middle class family consisting of a housewife mother, a not-so-well-paid government employee father, a jobless big-on-plans elder son, a computer engineer working-in MNC younger son and a probably-student daughter. A family as muddled and comic as most of our families are.The movie has awesome performances by two of the most versatile actors of the industry - Anupam Kher and Boman Irani, who lead the show. Equally good is Ranveer Shourey whose slightly haryanvi accent and matter-of-fact dialogue delivery sets him apart. Navin Nischol is a veteran who was a really good choice for the role. Tara Sharma is also quite well cast, though Koel Purie could have been a better choice.The things that strike you in the movie are the typical characters, the sarcastic humor, the realism and the wonderful Delhi feel that is hard to miss. The actors are really well chosen and all the offices/homes etc. are also pretty typical of the characters. The characters themselves are typical of the kind of people you come across in real life, which adds humor to the whole story.Overall, the movie is really good fun to watch." 
" One of the better Hindi Movies!!","Very original and well made with great acting,Khosla ka Ghosla is really one of the better bollywood movies made at low cost.Boman Irani is just too good as a crooked property dealer,he delivers another masterpiece.Ranvir Shorey comes good again after Pyar ke Side Effects.I have never seen such a good Vj turned actor. :)Anupam Kher,Parvin Dabbas,Tara Sharma,Vinay Pathak,Navin Nischol all of them are very good in their roles.The originality,simplicity of every character and script are strong points of the movie,and it struck right at time,when demolitions in Delhi are being carried out." 
" Very close to reality","When I first heard about the movie "Khosla Ka Ghosla", I thought it is yet another nonsensical comedy. But now after seeing the movie I feel that the makers of the movie could have done even better had they not used the current title. I don't say that the title is not apt for the movie but at first instance it gives a totally different impression of what the movie is going to be like than it actually is.Kamal Kishore Khosla (Anupam Kher) is just another head of a middle-class family who spends his entire life's earning to buy a plot in Delhi. He wants to build a new house for his family that has his wife (Kiran Juneja), his elder son Balwant(Ranveer Shourie), his second son Chirounjilal (Parvin Dabas) and his daughter. Chirounjilal works for an MNC and is trying hard to get out of the country and his elder brother Balwant is just another unemployed big-on-plans self-proclaimed genius.Boman Irani(Khurana) is a rich businessman who illegally takes possession of the plot of land that Khosla had bought for building his dream house. The estate agent who sold the plot to Khosla is a member of Khurana's team. The offer the agent makes on behalf of Khurana to Khosla is buying the plot at half the market value (the amount Khosla had already paid).The movie is very close to reality. Many such incidents take place in Delhi NCR. I myself have heard about many such cases which were common when Gurgaon was not as developed as it is now.Getting back to the movie, the rest of it shows how The Khoslas try to get back possession of their plot leaving no stone unturned and turn out to be successful too.All the actors starting from Anupam Kher and Boman Irani to Navin Nishchol and Parvin Dabas have performed very well. And not to forget the quick-witted one-liners by Ranveer Shourie that compel you to giggle even in a movie like this." 
" A must watch for all those who want a bite of the reality in the Indian or and community for that matter, overall a great informative and nice movie","In the beginning, i thought that it was a pure comedy movie. It was a bit slow in the beginning but later on it turned out to be a nice informative flick. Had a pinch of romance also. The movie tells us how some people help you in your bad times and how some are the other way. Khosla's role (played by Anupem Kher) was finely played and he was entertaining as ever. As the title suggests, the movie revolves around how khosla's try to get back their home from a bad guy. They try all means from being straight and then finally how they manage with other means to get back their plot. You can compare the title even with 'Lage Raho Munnabhai'. The movie is also very inspiring. Khosla had two sons, both tried their ways of getting back the plot and how the one ( computer engineer from IITD ( i saw him wearing IIT-DELHI T-shirt) ) makes a plan along with one of his Visa granting chap to get their plot back. Earlier they tried police, social groups and also wrestlers but all in vain. Police and even social workers were also up for money. Everybody, all khoslas and the bad guy did superb acting and portrayal of the society today. Overall, a great movie to watch with your family and kids." 
" Strikingly heartfelt......Wonderfully enacted","This film belongs to Anupam Kher. Such is his performance, that one feels anger, pity, sorrow and hatred alongside him. He creates sheer magic with his character (a meek, hardworking 50-something father of three) and nurtures it to what is befittingly a happy end.Khosla ka Ghosla is a quick witted, light hearted comedy/drama that has kept up to the potential of its star cast. Boman Irani (fresh of the success of Munnabhai) delivers yet another masterpiece. You try not to hate his character, but fail on every count. The surprise package of the film has to be Ranvir Shorey. He has grown by leaps and bounds as an actor and has matured immensely from his VJing days. He has essayed his role with a lot of self-exuding method and panache. Parvin Dabbas and Tara Sharma have quick sharp performances. As I mentioned, you really can't fault the star cast.If there is a downside to the film, it has to be in its appeal to the masses. This reflects in the film being an honest to goodness story that fails to connect with the everyday 'junta'.Indian cinema is coming of age and this is yet another step in the right direction.7.5/10" 
" It can't get better than this...","Recently watched this movie and was totally blown away by the simplicity of it. Is it so difficult to make a movie with a tight script, good character building and great acting. After watching KKG, it seems so easy. There is nothing which gives out that this is a Bollywood product. No great locations (Yashraj style), no designer clothes (Johar style), no melodrama (Barjatya style), but still more than managed to hold the viewer's attention.But then what else do you expect from a movie with real 'actors' like Anupam Kher, Boman Irani and not to forget, Navin Nischol. I won't go into the script, but it suffices to say that only once in a while do we get to see movie with a middle class man at its center. And then again, he is not a young, college going kid, who falls in love with a girl, but (gasp) a retired employee, who dreams to build his own house. How frequently do we get to see films with characters we can relate to? KKG breaks the typical Bollywood mould in many ways. Just watch it to believe that there are still some good thinkers and creators left in the industry." 
" Brilliantly enacted","'Khosla Ka Ghosla' should be undoubtedly one of the best bollywood movies made in recent times. The movie revolves around a very realistic plot and depicts the dreams, anxieties and helplessness of the common man. I truly believe, these are the kind of films that ought to be made more often in bollywood. The kind which reflect on everyday life and make you think while having a good laugh. Running around trees and the alps does nobody no good. The biggest plus for the movie was that all the actors could actually act ( no irritating star kids in this one ), each and every character in the movie can be related to very easily. Kudos to the director and all the actors. Ranbir Shourie in particular was hilarious. I always liked his sense of humor when he was a DJ but, he has taken it up a notch with this one. This one is a must watch." 
" A Superb Comic Thriller","According to me, there are two genres of comedy... One is artificially injected with crazy jokes that intend to make you smile, and the other is simple everyday dialogues and sequences which have no such intention, but... you end up laughing like hell! Khosla Ka Ghosla (literally Khosla's Nest!) is one such pure entertainment that can liven up even the dull-est of the souls. From frame one, the "action" begins and next two hours you just wont let anything disturb you watching it.Khosla (Anupam Kher) has saved every penny he earned in his life for building a dream home on a newly purchase plot at South Delhi. Just as everything seems set for a ground breaking ceremony, a powerful builder, Khurana (Boman Irani) encroaches the plot and shatters all his dreams.How the motley crew of his family and their friends help Khosla finally realize his dreams, forms the rest of the story. The "plot" develops in such a thrilling manner that there are moments you would actually pray for Khosla's mission team.Casting is perfect. Apart from great performances by veterans like Anupam Kher, Boman Irani and Navin Nischol, you will enjoy even the characters played by off-beat actors like Ranvir Shorey (Frankly I didn't knew he can act so well), Parvin Dabas, Nitish Pandey and Vinay Pathak.I would call it "A Superb Comic Thriller". Excellent Job Mr.Dibakar Banerjee." 
" Brilliant Movie","I saw this movie today and I must say it was totally Brilliant.Its very original and very well Directed.Dibakar Banerjee has done a very good job the script is very simple and straight forward but some twist in the end.To be honest I wasn't expecting it to be good at all.But good direction and light comedy made this movie a very good movie.I would recommend this movie to everyone.It can be very good entertainer. Anupam Kher,Tara Sharma,Vinay Pathak,Ranvir,Parvin Dabas Boman Irani and others have done a fantastic job.They all justify their roles very honestly.Best part about this movie is everything is very simple and realistic.And my favourite no songs in between interupting the story and pace of the movie. I hope more such kind of simple and practical movies come out instead of movies like DHOOM which are cheap RIP-OFF of Hollywood movies." 
" A fresh breeze after long time in Indian Cinema...","Every one who involved in making this film should be greatly appreciated, especially Director Dibakar, Anupam kher, Ranveer, Parveen Dhabas and every actor who just lived in their character all through the movie. Believe me, you will never feel you are watching some thing which is made up but witnessing some thing just out of our daily life with wit, spontainity, hard-hitting truth, innocence, manipulation, emotions and comedy which is an undercurrent in every frame. Ranveer, Anupam and parveen and each one will mesmerize you with their acting provess which is COMPLETE in every sense. A lot of people in the cinema world who are spending on making miserable films with not even of a wafer thin quality should learn a lot from this movie. Dibakar!!! You did a splendid job!! Also every actor.."
