" Apart from the unconvincing climax it is a decent metro entertainer overall.","A project completely dependent upon the already famous comic persona of TV actor-anchor, Manish Paul, MICKEY VIRUS is a fairly entertaining film if we keep aside its awkward and unconvincing climax ruining the fine build-up. It has an enjoyable first half, mostly providing the funny moments through its Computer-ish dialogues, having a strong youth appeal using the Delhi ambiance, which also lacks the perfection as seen in VICKY DONOR). Yes, the humour element in it takes a back seat since the film turns into a thrilling crime mystery post interval, still the racy pace doesn't let you feel the missing factor and the new twists in the story line keep the interest alive. However as the secret is revealed, it doesn't turn out to be that convincing or hard hitting at all, hampering the overall impact of an engrossing watch as it ends.Thankfully made on a fresh subject, the film begins on a shaky note but then goes on to deliver the promised humor constantly, mainly through its well written lines. Revolving around a computer hacker caught in a messy trap, it has some cool graphics, better than many other films of the past using the same element. At times romance disturbs the progression but the justification arrives later as the con begins and there are very few drops in its narration before the long climax. Both the background score & cinematography keep the energy going along with a few above average songs including "Sajna Ve".As expected, Manish Paul impressively is the part of almost all the entertaining sequences of the film and he once again proves his excellent comic timing in its debut film too. Elli Avram looks stunning but doesn't get much to do as per the script (except serving the glamour quotient of the film, as required). Out of the friendly group, Puja Gupta gets the maximum scenes and she is fine, whereas Raghave Kakkar, Vikesh Kumar and Nitesh Pandey (Professor) are just all right. Manish Chaudhari repeatedly delivers a similar kind of act as seen in his previous films but the one actor who comes up as a clear winner among the supporting cast is Varun Badola, who is simply lovable as the assisting inspector.As the first notable attempt from director Saurabh Varma, MICKEY VIRUS mainly scores for its novel subject, well worked upon lingo, entertaining first half and Manish Paul. However with a different & severely edited climax it could have been a much better venture for sure. Also with a subject majorly dealing with the city culture (hugely dependent on gadgets), it is going to find fewer takers in the interiors and smaller centers. So keeping this fact and the film's fresh, out of the routine subject in mind, I would like to rate it as a nice, well attempted metro entertainer, just missing the target due to its final reels." 
" Mickey Virus : Bahut Kutta cheez hai yeh Mickey","Welcome to the world of hackers and Trojans – with enough idiosyncrasy and meticulousness, writer/director Saurabh Varma narrates a story which is seldom witnessed on the silver screen. With its titular resemblance to the sleeper hit of 2012,Vicky Donor , Mickey Virus is a complete departure in its theme and subject which delves into the murky world of cyber-crime and hacking keeping the humor quotient intact.Set in New Delhi, the plot is centered around a lazy mastermind , a genius hacker Mickey Arora (Manish Paul ) who is hired by the Delhi Police led by ACP Sidhant (Manish Chaudhary) and his assistant Bhalla(Varun Badola) to crack the racket of the cyber gangsters who have created ruckus in the city through serial murders. Mickey is a slacker , hangs out with his gang – Chutney, Floppy and Panjo who are whiz-kids in their own admissions and is smitten by the sexy lady, Kamayani(Elli Avram). After a lot of resistance due to his work-phobic attitude, he succumbs to the demands of the ACP who is hell-bent on this 'Hacking ki duniya ka Sehwag' but little does Mickey know that he is sucked into the whirlpool of dangerous nexus with life-threatening ramifications. What happens next !Varma picks the nuances of Saddi Dilli with flourish – the grey marketplace of Nehru place where people even sell 'W' alphabet of the keyboard as 'M' (After all , its oolta M !)are captured with great details. He has done his research on the subject well and this becomes more apparent from the plethora of information bombarded on the average viewer related to internet and software lingoes(server crash, firewall, buffering..).After a few funny sequences in the beginning, he throws us altogether into a different orbit of intrigue and mystery and keeps us riveted till the climactic revelation. There are particularly no glaring flaws but I wish Varma could have been more innovative while dealing with the serious portions and the romantic angle involving Manish and Elli. He appears myopic while handling the cat-and-mouse game where every tick of the clock matters.Manish Paul is a delight to watch ! As a débutant (with a passable cameo in Farah Khan's disastrous TMK as Master India), he exudes charm and confidence with his impeccable comic timing.His vocal rendering(Pyar China ka maal hai ) is equally quirky !Elli Avram looks jaw-dropping gorgeous and is sincere in her part. Mickey's hack-gang comprising of Raghav Kakkar, Puja Gupta and others give him a credible support.Manish Chaudhry is very convincing as the stern cop, but the real combat machine here is Varun Badola who triumphs with his ingenious straight- faced humor and mouths crackling dialogues with typical Haryanwi accent.If suspense thrillers are your cup of cake, then go for it – You will have a good time ! And that's not all, there is a scope for its sequel too !My Rating : 3/5" 
" Trojan Infected! ♦ 50%","Bollywood finally welcomes a caper comedy which samples the much-awaited "hacking" element. Only, the film, with a let-down plot, overstays and gives an impression that it did got infected by the Trojan... the Bollywood Trojan!The mumbo-jumbo is fantastic for a commoner, but if you are a computer-freak and know a thing or two about hacking and stuff, you are in for utter disappointment. Why? Because the samples, borrowed from various sources (other films, quotes, books, memes, usual parlance, etc.) lack plausibility. The degree of technicality is a gimmick: the film showcases the fictionalized material of computers, hacking & cryptography.The plot is ludicrous, mind you! The makers/writers have taken a predictable heist plot and juxtaposed it with teeny Delhi & the computer fundamentals. Cast is fine, where Varun Badola stands out. Elli Avram should munch on probably the first & the last film of her career.Music & songs are good. And the B'wood Trojan I was talking about is the climax sequence, which happens in a type of garage (remember the tons of movies that end at a derelict garage/warehouse?) where the characters narrate what happened so that the viewers can make sense of the plot; wonderful! And you will ask where the hell was the virus involved? You mean the Mickey Virus? Oh, please!Finally, the witty lines, generous humor, Dilliwalli language, 2 plot twists and the sex quotient of the newbie makes me rate it average.BOTTOM LINE: In an attempt to create a breakthrough, Mickey Virus gets infected halfway. Yet, for the heck of it, Mickey Virus is a calm/mindless watch on a Sunday afternoon. Of course, you could wait for the rentals. Faintly recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: Very Mild | Nudity/Sex/Vulgarity: No | Mouth-Kiss/Foreplay: Very Mild | Alcohol/Smoking/Drugs: No | Violence/Gore: Mediocre" 
" Mickey Virus doesn't need an anti-virus....","Mickey virus is basically a story based in Delhi where youngsters deal with this world virtually behind a computer screen that is hacking. It also has a hackers gang and a few cops trying for a 100 Crore Rupees heist. This movie deserves a lot but wont get what it deserves due to lack of awareness. For me Manish Paul was amazing and Elli Avram as KungFu Chameli was charming. All the other characters were good and funny like "floppy,chutni,pancho" etc. Manish as Mickey for me was way beyond my expectations, as a host he is awesome and as an anchor too whether its a reality show or an award show. "Pyaar China Ka Maal Hai" sung by Manish himself and "Tose Naina" sung by Arijit Singh are melodious. Overall its gonna be a fine evening/weekend watching it. Its fresh and I salute the Director Saurabh Verma for trying a not so common new subject. 8 out of 10 stars." 
" a treat to d intellectual :)","Mickey virus: Girls u r in 4r a treat. Its 'Wake Up, Sid' Tees n Jeans , d lean physique of Hugh Jackman and Ayushman Khurana's cuteness ol put together in 1 computer Hacker. Dis movie will start on a slow pace,der will a tinge of humour which will keep u seated in the hall. Thediction is geeky. Wid names like Floppy, Professor and substitutes like upload, google karle,etc . The dialogues are pleasantly entertaining.But the actual bomb (the climax) explodes nearing the end of the intermission. This movie is gonna test ur intellect. All those who enjoyed 'Aashique 2', 'Ranjhana', might not enjoy this movie but for those who enjoyed the intellect pleasing 'The Lunchbox' are gonna love this movie. It will have webs n webs of reasoning and actions intertwined for the audience to unravel as they watch the movie, with no clue whats gonna follow, the story twists and turns so rapidly. There are hackers, the police, a corrupt politician's bank account, some naive romance and an overall cuteness. The thrill v got when watching 'Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!' and 'Johnny Gaddar' will be experienced once again. The creative direction has catered well for the Indian Audience, making hacking look all colorful and animated and hence easily understandable. All actors could act for a change and act well. Right from the lead actor, Manish Paul, to the minors like the Taxi driver and the watchman have played their part well. It even gave us life lessons. Ha!Novel, logical, wid more homour and lil non-sense, and a mind boggling storyline. This one of a kind movie on Computer hacking is a must watch !" 
" A decent IT entertainer","I enjoyed the movie. The young hacker was well played by the newcomer Manish. And the two other major characters , the police ACP and his side kick Valla, was played quite believably by the actors.
There are some welcome twists.
Kamyani was played with delectable visuals by Elli avram. Her entry point as the cartoon character Kung fu chameli was stunning in an yellow sari.
The rapid progression to love seemed forced but the focus of the screenplay was on the other issue.
The laid back but shrewd character of young hacker was portrayed well.
Shades of Noir thriller comes into the fore towards the end.
Some amount fun is there in the interplay between the lead characters.
Well worth a watch in an evening." 
" All the hype-hoolah surrounding film is drowned by a wafer thin plot. Neither comical nor thriller","When the trailer of Mickey Virus was unleashed on the internet, everybody started comparing the movie with critically acclaimed Vicky Donor(probably both the films were Delhi based and title sounded same). However, if Vicky Donor was heaven then Mickey is a ride through hell.Delhi Cops are on the verge of cracking a case which involves high intensity of hacking for which they seek help of young-clad, computer geek Mickey. As they start solving the case, series of events unleashes new mystery involving lots of twist and turns.First time director Saurabh Verma chooses the script which promises to deliver an intellectual-comic thriller but believe me neither there is any story nor any direction. The plot is confusing as is the screenplay. First half is monotonous and perfunctory. Chemistry between Manish Paul and Ellie Avaram is half baked. Things turns bit interesting after the murder but loses the steam with a blink of eye. Cinematography is okay. Art direction is fine. Editing is loose. Dialogues are over-the-top. Music is disappointing. Manish Paul shows some potential as Mickey Virus but needs to improve on his expression. Ellie looks gorgeous but has long way to go in terms of acting. Varun Badola steals the thunder and is the only silver lining in the film.Overall, all the hype-hoolah surrounding film is drowned by a wafer thin plot. Neither comical nor thriller.Poor 1/5" 
" A novel concept that dies in the end","Mickey Virus was quite a novel concept of hackers which however fell short of making a mark - courtesy the ending and few script errorsThe film seems to follow the concept of Vicky Donor of Punjabi slang here too we have an anchor making his foray into films and also the characteristics.The film has an interesting story which hooks you sadly the second half starts to drag but the worst is the amateurish handling of the climax which tosses the film.Direction is decent Music is okayManish Paul is no actor yet and has a long way to go but he does his role well, which is different from his anchoring, He has to improve a lot especially in emotions yet for debut it's fair. Alli Avram is not too convincing, Manish Chaudhary is as usual fab but getting typecast, Pooja Gupta is okay, Nitesh Pandey is good and others are okay" 
" Good entertaining movie......recommended watch.","I watched the movie last night..... it is great fun.After a full day at work.....and with deprived sleep, when you walk into a cinema past mid-night, you are bound to dose off during the show......but not when you are out to watch Mickey Virus.From the start and all the way to the end....keeps you well awake.....bursting out into laughter and fully entertained.There is some seriousness towards the end but that too filled with good mystery/suspense.Overall, good job. Well done to the directors, actors and the rest of the team.Watchable again !!!! Will schedule it again with friends back in Bahrain :)" 
" Mickey virus as the title says enjoy movie","This movie is on the hackers as everyone knows that hackers stole from your computer anything as they like. Todays, date everything is done on computer as money transaction, money transfer etc So this movie is totally on the stolen money through the bank with the help of computer by hackers. This movie used new actor and actress. As manish paul is actor of movie and Eli avram is the actress of movie both have done great work. Actress can't speak Hindi so they dubbed it. Its new trend in the Bollywood not to use Indian girl except they use outsider and dubbed them I don't know why they do that but she shows her great body and good work on movie she looks stunning and beautiful. Story of the movie is about manish who is an hacker who use to work for fun . But he is not that bad guy. Police want to capture some people who are hacker and killing the people too. So they use manish to find those people. But story got changed when manish accidentally steal the money from bank and after that whole new story of the movie started. So, it's a suspense movie you have to watch to find out what's happen next. But movie is better than its promo look on TV. Great fun movie absolutely watch the movie and don't start taking out fault in the movie if you started taking out the mistake in the movie there is lot of it and I wasted my lot time in thinking that because manish does not look like good hacker just types the random keyboard button like that are the example of mistake in movie it will waste your time instead of that enjoy the movie because it got good song totally entertainment movie." 
" Quite Entertaining","This movie exceeded my expectations as I was not expecting to be so entertaining. Its director's debut film and he had really done a good job. Story was very well written. There were very few goofs which are certainly difficult to notice. Few holes in plot but not very deep.Target audience of the film is below 30's so director has used all flashes and masala which mentioned age group likes. Acting was slightly at low end. Manish Paul acting was not up to the mark. Same is with true with most of actors in this film. But Manish Chaudhary and Varun Badola both have done great job.Music and songs are good and it will not annoy you or distract you while watching this film.Its a packed mystery/thriller from start to end. Once started, you will ignore all calls of nature or have to ignore calls of nature till the end. If you don't trust me then watch it and find yourself what I mean. Seriously its a FANTASTIC thriller and great time passer." 
" I really enjoy this Indian film!","This is what happens when millions and millions are not invested! Minds get creative, and within the right direction the result is smart, funny, and twisted.Even though this movie is cheesy on its elaboration by Hollywood 's standards, it has all the elements to keep the interest from beginning to end, the plot is a little predictable (if you have paid attention to details) Still, it manages to mislead in some of the predictions that any of us would have made. Seeing that most of the reviews where from India, I almost did not watch it; happily I made the right decision! The first part of the movie is kind of funny, and the screen is filled up with a beautiful,actress, and as commonly on Indian movies the songs serve a double porpoise, filling into the fun and romantic aspect as much as the dramatic and adventurous theme.Certainly, if you are looking for an uplifting time, this is a movie for you (still be ready for some unfortunate moments for some of the characters that we get to care, but resembling some natural things I just have to say: "c'est la vie". Overall if you are interested on foreign-entertaining movies as I am this one will provide for a good time." 
" One of the better thrillers from Bollywood","I am a huge fan of thriller movies but I was always disappointed by the lack of quality thrillers from Bollywood. Most of the Bollywood films are Rom-coms & over the top action. This movies comes as a surprise, as one of the first cyberpunk thriller movie from Bollywood. The premise is decent, but don't expect to see real world hacking, just a few random terminal sessions and swoosh banking sites hacked, computers cracked etc.. This movie is shot in Delhi & the local slangs are spot on. Manish Paul is surprisingly good in his first venture, he carries role surprisingly well. Director has done a decent job too. Overall a Good film." 
" Unpredictable One","I hesitantly downloaded the movie from a torrent site assuming that it would be the same typical bollywood movie with similar lines and farce illogical love stories. But to my astonishment, it was not like that. The movie shows that bollywood has still some gems of creative work. From the very outset the story of the movie is not predictable as is habitual in contemporary bollywood movies. And this fashion advances till end.Story is revealed timely and slowly in the manner that you ll find no boredom till the end. TV anchor and débutant Manish paul has done a superb job and he has done justice with the role. Expressions are touchy and natural. Elli Avarm has brief role in the movie though, but she is charming and beautiful. Her figure is sexy but contrary she has no acting skills. But in Bollywood one actress can survive with this kind of show of body only,for, in Bollywood for a women body counts more than acting and hence she's good in that.Overall it's a good movie and recommended." 
" Amazing Thriller with Flavor of Comedy and Emotions","I hardly get any time for writing reviews nowadays, due to my busy work schedule. But after watching this movie, I really wants to write review as none of IMDb reviewer is interested to write for this movie. This movie is really very interesting with flavors of Comedy, Internet, Emotions, Mystery and my City Dilli. Though few scenes are not as good as expected and looks like a cool dude firangy girl sort of boring love story but once the story starts its pace, its amazing. I will not ruin any sort of suspense or write any spoiler but its not a average comedy or love story, its basically a high tech murder mystery movie with lots of emotions. On Acting part, I am amazed with the work of Manish Paul, I hate him as an anchor but here he is superb, and the scene before interval when he visits actress apartment made u cry. Varun Badola as a Cop gives comic relief here. Manish Chauahn looks like Aamir of Talaash and a very serious cop. Rest all characters are okay and did superb work as newcomers. Songs and their timing are fantastic. Director proves his smartness in his debut venture. And I love my Dilli locations.... I hope more these sort of small budget movies will come in future and entertain us. All The Best Mickey Virus for Box Office Business. Rating 9/10" 
" I want this virus","Mickey Virus is India's first film about hacking, and its a very well made one. Mickey Virus starts off as a comedy but slowly the turns and twists in the 2nd half make it a crime thriller. The Films main story is about a bunch foreign hackers dying in India, why are they dying, who is behind this game is the main plot. Acting wise its a Manish Paul show all the way, in his debut performance he impress, and shows glimpses of a star. First time director Saurabh Varma proves his talent in the first film itself, he makes a fine film, with a complex and fresh story.Overall if your looking for a good film with good entertainment and you are tired of the run of mill bollywood films, watch mickey virus you will not be disappointed!!!"
