" A worthless official remake of a Cult Comedy from the West.","From the last few years Bollywood has been open to fresh ideas and low budget experimental projects especially after the success of small films such as BHEJA FRY (2007). But where Bheja Fry was a complete rip-off, the present BUMBOO is the official remake of L'EMMERDEUR or A PAIN IN THE ASS (1973) written by Francis Veber who interestingly was also the man behind THE DINNER GAME (1998), the original source for Bheja Fry. It seems that the famous comedy writer-director Francis Veber has too many fans or followers in Bollywood. A few years back David Dhawan made his DO KNOT DISTURB (2009) inspired from Francis's THE VALET (2006), and now we have an official remake of one of his most famous movies which has been remade more than thrice. After its first release in 1973 directed by Edouard Molinaro (in French), the film was remade by Billy Wilder in English with the title BUDDY BUDDY in 1981. Director Kartal Tiber made it in Turkish in 1982 calling it BAS BELASI. And Francis himself directed its French remake with the same title in 2008.Unfortunately the latest Indian remake of the cult comedy remains the worthless of them all without offering any kind of entertainment in its short duration. The original story revolves around a Hit man who checks into a hotel right in front of the court to shoot his given target. But his adjoining room is taken by a frustrated man who wishes to kill himself after a broken affair. Now how this man becomes an obstacle in the Hetman's mission is the whole gist of the movie. It's a black comedy which has many interesting sequences in its 1973 and 1981 versions. But in BUMBOO the writers fail to impress completely with their deliberately added tracks such as the scenes in the police van which were not there in the original. Moreover with an all over the top & amateurish climax it becomes a painful experience bought for a price.Debutant director Jagdish Rajpurohit, who also plays a cameo in the film, tries too hard to make you laugh, which doesn't work at all. The execution of its various (supposed to be funny) sequences is unimpressively over stretched which is unable to generate any kind of laughter among the audience. Apart from the direction the main culprit behind the failure of this remake is its inappropriate casting wherein Sharat Saxena doesn't fit into the lead role of a helpless hit-man at all. Kavin Dave has only got the funny looks but hasn't got the other essential elements to feature in a comic movie. Sudhir Pandey once again overacts in his short role. But only Sanjay Mishra is the one who gives you some good moments in this bizarre attempt. Musically the film has nothing to offer just as its script. In short, Bumboo is one of those lousy remakes which ruin the magic of watching their original hits. So better avoid it and go for any of its earlier versions, preferably the very first one made in 1973." 
" Almost better than the original","Confession: I saw the French original (L'emmerdeur) in French (I am a French translator) and was totally entertained. When I saw Bumboo, however, I had no clue that it was a remake (after purchasing rights). I was totally entertained again. The best part is that this film has been very well adapted and in fact is in some ways better than the original. BTW, I felt the same about Bheja Fry, which again is a copy from a French film by the same writer.Small budget films are harshly massacred by high-brow critics. I see it happening with Bumboo too. Most reviews always fail in India because they do not give importance to the entertainment quotient. This is an entertaining film with full value for your money.The plus points of the film are: excellent adaptation of the original plot; sticks to the original quite closely; local humor; not too much of crass or vulgar comedy. The taste of most of our audiences have been ruined by crass comedies -- so the audience may find this refined comedy difficult to understand and digest. Of course, some bits of hamming, crass jokes are there.The negative points: the original script was good, but in the adaptation the same level of perfection is not there. Some average jokes (mainly because of the low budget) have crept in. Due to low budget perhaps stalwarts like Vinay Pathak and Rajat Kapoor are not there. They would have taken this film to an entirely different level. Most of the cast are just about adequate. Sterling performances would have really raised the bar of this film.Excellence in script writing is what this film lacks. Which is sad because no real effort on the story was required. Direction too is just about good. With better scripting and direction, this film would have been a hit. Better acting and the film would have been a super hit.Do watch the film because it is highly entertaining -- despite its several faults. Want to end with another confession: I was so engrossed in the movie and laughing out aloud that I had no time to check the reactions of the audience." 
" It is Based on an original story by Francis Veber","This is a Watchable comedy.Its not hilarious, but not terrible either.A one-time watch! I would say a good entertainer with a good humorous flavor of comedy. Must not miss this one.Bumboo is based on the west movie story line Francis Veber.It is a good and amazing attempt by Jagdish Rajpurohit and team.The Screenplay needed more wit. Jagdish Rajpurohit's Direction lacks finesse. Cinematography is below-average. Editing is sharp.A small Synopsis of movie - Bumboo movie is based on one simple idea. Every person meets someone, who screws it up and makes life miserable (In the 'Bambaiyya' lingo it is called as 'Vaat Lagna'). In Bumboo the movie each character screws someone or the others happiness. Each situation is humorous and ends up into comedy of errors." 
" Watchable!","Based on an original story L'emmerdeur written by Francis Veber, 'Bumboo' is a Watchable comedy. Its not hilarious, but not terrible either. A one-time watch!'Bumboo' Synopsis: A suicidal photographer & a sharpshooter end up in the same hotel, with different intentions of course. Things run wild when these two form an unlikely friendship. 'Bumboo', despite some merit, needed to be funnier. Although the length is well-balanced, 109-minutes, the comedy falls flat in the second-hour. The first-hour is pleasant & even humorous, but the second-hour plays a spoilsport. The Screenplay needed more wit. Jagdish Rajpurohit's Direction lacks finesse. Cinematography is below-average. Editing is sharp.Performance-Wise: Kavin Dave is apt for the role. But its Sharat Saxena & particularly Sanjay Mishra, who come up with brilliant performances. They dominate the show! Sudhir Pandey is loud, but delivers. Mandy Takhar needs to polish her acting skills.On the whole, 'Bumboo' is a fair watch."
