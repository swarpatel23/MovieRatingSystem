" This is the worst movie I ever watched.","This is by far the worst movie I ever watched in all genres. The theater was absolutely empty. Cheap production quality shows right from the beginning.The movie is as slow and monotonous. Its a 10 min movie stretched over 2 hrs in the worst way possible. It lacks content and never catches your attention even for a second. Poor direction, poor script, poor screenplay and sub par acting. For the Gory parts - I am absolutely sure these guys did not watch a single Hollywood movie for inspiration. The good thing is its absolutely original how else could it be this boring.I would rather watch a guy eating KFC chicken for over 2 hrs than watch this movie. Please save yourself and your family. This is video terrorism if such a term exists. Issued in public interest." 
" All Terrible Everything. ♦ 23%","Much like the status in title, it talks about the origin. And while it talks cliché, it fails to show the source i.e. how did the lead character become a zombie?With terrible cinematography, direction & setup, India's first zombie origin film sucks to depth. The first half is full of simple, no- narrative sequences which evinces the individuality of the lead character. The last twenty minutes actually shows the gore, zombieness and all that's expected in a horror movie; only it doesn't scare a bit.Makeup, effects, music & cast performance is the only laudable thing, but since the foundation itself crooked, they don't matter at all. 2.3 out of 10 for incomparable stupidity & insanity on screen. And the romance just tops it with ridicule.BOTTOM LINE: Not recommended as it will eventually waste time to say what we all perhaps know through our surrounding info flow. Very bad attempt.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity/Vulgarity/Sex/Mouth-Kiss/Smoking: No | Alcohol/Drugs: Mild | Violence: Mild | Gore: Strong" 
" Rise of the Zombie is India's first Hindi zombie film in a 100 years of Indian Cinema","We are a country that is so rooted in superstitions within the horror genre, we haven't gone beyond the ghosts and spirits.. But at the same time we also realize that we have the new generation that is glued to the international popular culture and zombies are a huge part of it.It was a bit of a challenge as you want to put on screen (a film) that has no connection with the already made zombie films. Mostly zombie films are survival films where a bunch of humans survive a bunch of zombies and all the madness that ensues in between. But we wanted to introduce the Indian audiences to the concept of zombie with the story of its origin. So every zombie has a story of how he turned into a zombie and we tell the story of one such human being and what happens to him and how he is unable to cope with it." 
" A well crafted Zombie-origin film for Indian audience...","Zombie is one such concept which oscillates between two extremes when it comes to audience reaction....either one is crazy about this genre or strongly repugnant to it. From Romero's idea of Living dead to Rodriquez's quirky, pulp zom-com there have been numerous experiments with this genre resulting in a cult following for the same. Totally unexplored in Indian cinema the genre is catching up pace with various releases this year. With a limited audience for this genre majority of the audience has to be educated & then they can acquire the taste for Zombie films which borders between blood & gore.It was a daunting task for Luke Kenny & his team to come with a serious zombie film & that also one which showcases the gradual transformation of a human to a flesh devouring living dead. The film starts with a camera zooming on to different aspects of nature establishing the protagonist Neel Parker's passion towards photography which is also his profession. Being so involved with himself & his love for wildlife photography he starts getting far away from his emotional belongings – love & friendship but he doesn't seem to get bothered by these "minor" jolts as long as his best companion "Camera" is with him. Thus, after a rift with his GF he moves to some jungle in Uttarakhand & indulge in his passion, where his camera, the nature & his thoughts are his only companions. The serene existence within laps of nature has been aptly highlighted with long footage of Parker's peaceful daily life which gets topsy-turvy with a bite from an "unknown" bug..and there begins the transitional journey from a human to a zombie.Through the bug bite the director duo straight away hints on a virus being the root cause behind the catastrophe. The transformation at physical and psychological level has been showed with precise detailing with Parker's gradual denial towards human food & growing interest to consume living animals starting with ants.The strive against one's impression with gradually getting transformed into a monster has been depicted with dexterity. Through back & forth narrative we are subjected to the progressive loss of his earlier memory & at the same time snippets from his previous life could be seen. Here audience could empathize with the fate of this man. At certain point the flashback becomes monotonous & scenes getting repetitive which hampers the pace.Credit should be given to the debutant director duo (Luke Kenny & Devaki Singh) for not shying away from the showing gory part of a zombie's existence. Unlike majority zombie films which focus on group of human blasting away zombie's head to glory; here the focus is on the inner demon as a person gets metamorphisized. From insects to birds to humans the devouring sequences are somewhat graphic which might not appeal to many Indian cine-goers. In one such scene Parker snatches out a heart from a man's body while in another he is squeezing the eye out of the socket from the body of a girl. In fact faint-hearted should strictly refrain from watching this (& those who are still amateurs to cannibalistic films should be cautious).But then those sequences supported with the silent background score creates the atmosphere & ambiance for the eerie setting. Human are most dangerous animal on earth – indeed the cannibalistic sequence have more shock value than any RGV's horror films with screeching background music. Pagiwala's camera captured the essence of the film. From the rejuvenating, calm wildlife to the destructive mayhem scenes are captured effectively. To compliment his camera work the sharp editing & Jhanjhani's make-up did the trick.Devaki – Kenny duo should be applauded for choosing such a convoluted horror script and then showing it in the simplest way possible. The film also takes a dig at human psychology. At core we all humans are nothing less than a zombie pouncing on other living creatures. At one flashback scene Parker is shown to eat some cooked meat & next moment the camera zooms to blood soaked teeth just after having a bite of a living creature – end of the day the crux is the name. Also the film hints on the bottleneck of today's stressed out existence whereby we are getting distant from our loved ones & turning out to be someone else without having any time to feel, think, love & care.The film ends with Parker totally transforming into a total flesh eating monster while his girlfriend (in some nearby metro city) sets out in search of him. The story gets to continue with "Land of the Zombie" (to be released in 2014) whose trailer is shown at the end. Here we get to see the whole town turning into a living dead & searching for flesh. In typical western zombie films the humans are few & they have to kill for their own survival.Luke Kenny did a commendable job with acting as well as direction. Being the captain of the ship he understood the concept & the character to the core which gets reflected in his performance. Towards the end of the film the introvert, quiet, dashing photographer could be seen no more, what is left of him is a flesh eating monster. Kirti Kulhari,Benjamin Gilani,aswin Mushran were adequate in their respective roles.2013 opens new gateways & brings the audience to a new genre – Zombies or the Living deads. With zomcom "Go goa Gone" on the pipeline we are hoping for varied zombie films in near future & more audience acceptance for this genre. As a starter this zombie-origin film did set the mood even though this one was probably (strictly) for a niche audience. Go for the chilling experience!!!" 
" Literally THE WORST zombie movie ever","And I've seen most of them. This was truly abysmal - terrible writing, bad acting, and it was absolutely so boring.
Don't even think about bothering, it's horrific." 
" Great story, great drama, awesome camera work, and Luke Kenny delivers. Zombie and indie film fans will not be disappointed.","'Rise of the Zombie', not to be confused with the 2012 film, 'Rise of the Zombies' starring Danny Trejo, is a film that zombie fans, as well as independent film lovers don't want to miss out on. I like it, maybe I love it. Director Luke Kenny plays Neil Parker, a wildlife photographer who, after deciding to spend a few days in the wilderness to clear his head after a fight with his girlfriend, is bitten or stung while taking photos of insects, small animals, and breathtaking landscape. Over the next few days his world slowly spins out of control; a dark and violent journey into what will soon be the incident that gives birth to the apocalyptic spreading of the zombie virus as we know it. Devaki Singh, writer and also co-director, tells a beautiful, terrifying, and believable story while Luke Kenny, co-director and lead actor sells his role brilliantly. 'Rise of the Zombie' is every bit as much a psychological thriller as it is the gory, body-parts-piling-up, flesh eating zombie horror. 'Rise of the Zombie' is not a blood and gore 'quick fix'. It's a film that doesn't replace quality for cheap thrills. It has a real story, real characters, real drama, and a real delivery that you have to wait for. But even with a slow start to the violent ripping of intestines and chewing-off of faces, that we have all come to expect and love from zombie movies, the wait is as much a part of the experience as the culminating horrific climax. It left me fully satisfied and wanting more. Although India has been in the filmmaking business for just over a hundred years, 'Rise of the Zombie' is the country's first zombie film and it will easily land in my top 20 favorite zombie films list. Even without all the subtitles, it's more than worth the ride to see how the beginning of the zombie apocalypse began in the mind of Devaki Singh. Highlights: The artistic way cinematographer, Murzy Pagdiwala uses the cameras and lighting to capture amazing landscapes, the small village traditions, as well as the violent motions during attacks not complement the story and add depth to Neil's emotional and mental decent, but it shares a piece of Hindu culture most have never experienced. Why Not 10 Stars?: The film is not spoken in English and the subtitles freeze up on about six or seven sentences for the majority of the film. I felt that this caused me to miss some of the storyline that I needed to connect with other characters more deeply.Don't forget: In the last few minutes the title 'Rise of the Zombie' appears on the screen. At the screening I first saw this film at, it was stopped there. After I watched it again I realized that it is not the end of the film and you may think the best part is in the three minutes following." 
" Well directed and very well Shot..","To be the first Zombie Origin movie from India there is a lot of barriers that hold you. Trying something that no one has tried before is difficult when it comes to Bollywood. You have to plant the seed deeply in the minds of an audience that doesn't like much change from the regular. Rise of the Zombie has done just that, beating the regular and is now being accepted by most in the country.The movie is about a Wildlife Photographer Neil(Luke Kenny)who gets infected when he's busy taking pictures in the wild. Then begins his pain and suffering. This infection causes his mind to loose control over himself gradually turning him into a Blood thirsty Zombie. The memories of his fight with his girlfriend Vinny(Kirti Kulhari) and not being able to contact any of his friends makes him more weak and lonely in the wild adding to his pain and agony. The movie continues very well till the end takes you thru every phase of turning into a Zombie. This is unlike any other Hollywood Zombie movie you have seen.Songs are good in the movie and all the Actors have done a good job especially Luke Kenny and Kirti Kulhari. A MUST WATCH MOVIE..." 
" I've Seen Them All...","The Zombie horror film genre is not new to me. In the past I've seen directors like George Romero(The Night, Dawn, and Day Of The Dead), Lucio Fulci(Zombie 1979), Jorge Grau(Let Sleeping Corpses Lie a.k.a The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue), Andrea Bianchi(Burial Ground: The Nights of Terror). Add to this list The Re-animator Trilogy directed by directors Stuart Gordon(1) and Brian Yuzna(2,3), and The Return Of The Living Dead 3 - a.k.a. Mortal Zombie(Brian Yuzna). These films are available on the internet. Search for them and either download them for your personal collection or watch them online for free. And there you have it. After watching all the above, watch Rise Of The Zombie(2013). You'll see the basic idea was copied from the above mentioned films. Plot: a man travels to remote forest location, where he sets camp and is generally alone. Man is bitten by unknown insect while exploring forest. Gradual transformation turns man into Zombie with an insatiable appetite for fresh meat(preferably human). Lone Zombie infects another human who in turn becomes a Zombie, spawning a mini-army of Zombies. Film ends here, where an teaser for Land Of The Zombie(2014) is placed. First of all these days its all about making money, even for independent film directors. At the start they have a meager budget and so have mediocre special effects. So they wait for the profits of the first film to kick in and hopefully dream of making either a sequel or franchise. Verdict: nothing new for the genre so zero points for creativity. The makeup effects and gore in the film is pathetic for a seasoned horror fan like myself who has seen better. The background score is decent to the movie and does not let the film down. The acting is decent and photography and location is adequate to this film. Actor Luke Kenny(who plays the Zombie) has acted before in films like Bombay Boys(1998) and Rock On!! (2008). He is a decent actor but I fear he will never rise above low budget B-movies. Actress Kirti Kulhari has even acted before in Dharini (2002), Khichdi: The Movie (2010), Shaitan (2011) and Jal(2013). She is a good looking, talented actress and I feel that if she gets the big break, could move into mainstream Bollywood films.They say that this is "INDIA'S FIRST ZOMBIE FILM". Then what about Tahkhana(1986)? This was also a Zombie film in my belief. The Ramsay brothers have been the mainstay of Hindi Horror. But since their departure, no company has focused more on the genre. Ram Gopal Varma Verman did brilliantly in movies like Raat, Bhoot and Phoonk. But since then his directional style has suffered. Vikram Bhatt is another superb horror film director with films like: 1920, Shaapit: The Cursed and Haunted - 3D. In conclusion: we need more heart and soul in our films. Then we'll surely succeed in reawakening this genre.More Ramsay Brother's Horror films: Purana Mandir 1984, Veerana 1988, Purani Haveli 1989 and Bandh Darwaza 1990." 
" dark and disturbing","This isn't a great film, but it does have an interesting premise. Zombie movies almost invariably focus on what happens after zombies enter the world, not the creation of the plague itself, or if they do show patient zero it's just a quick glance as they transition. This movie follows the last days of Neil Parker, a nature photographer who is bitten by an insect and contracts an illness that turns him into the famous monster.Neil likes to lose himself in his work, often disappearing without notice for weeks. After his most recent trip he returns to an angry girlfriend who ends their relationship. After one last night out with a friend for his bachelor party, Neil decides to head out into the wilderness to clear his head. The trip starts well enough, but as he's taking pictures of some insects he gets bitten by something, we're never shown exactly what, and gets a nasty wound on his arm.At first he basically ignores it, but after several days the wound is shown to have gotten bigger and uglier, with inflamed skin and large pustules. Still, he only cleans the wound and bandages it, hoping that it will get better on its own. Around this time he also begins experiencing some delirium from the illness and develops a sudden craving for insects and animals. Eventually, those cravings turn into something darker, until finally he becomes something subhuman.There are numerous graphic scenes of him succumbing to his new hunger, but what was really disturbing to me are the scenes of his dreams. At first they start as memories of happier times with his girlfriend, but gradually they begin to get disjointed and fragmented as the illness breaks down his human side. Anyone who has ever been severely ill will recognize the symptoms of fever dreams we sometimes get when sick or under severe stress, but the way it's depicted here is as a downward spiral with no end.Essentially, it's a front row seat to Neil's slow death, with him gradually realizing that he is losing himself. His memories change from a comfort of happier times to a torment that haunts him even as he loses the awareness of who he once was. Frankly, it's disturbing.So that's the part the movie gets right. Unfortunately, there is a lot it doesn't. The acting is often stiff and amateurish, with the actors almost seeming like they are just regular people that the producers asked if they wanted to be in a movie. And the cinematography is real B-movie grade stuff, with wide shots that serve no purpose except to keep the audience at arms distance instead of pulling us in, or terrible lighting that makes it hard to know exactly what's happening.But the worst aspect of the movie by far is the directing. The pacing is so bad that it makes the movie almost unwatchable. The only way I could get through it was by skipping ahead several minutes at a time to avoid overly long scenes that took forever to get to anything interesting. Watching a ten minute scene of Neil just sitting in the shadows watching the people of the village have a party was excruciating. Nothing happens, just people walking around and talking, and there are several scenes like that. And they make the odd choice of having his first indiscretions happen off screen, only hinting at the events in brief flashbacks, but bring us along for numerous animal and insect feasts.They also linger on his loved ones, who eventually begin to realize something is wrong because Neil has been gone so long, but bizarrely these plot lines are started but never finished. So much screen time is devoted to them calling one another and asking if anyone had seen him that finishing the movie without any of them ever finding him or figuring out what happened just makes you wonder why they bothered including them at all.Better editing might have shaved 30 minutes or so from the film and made it a better watch, but in truth it had so many problems that I'm not sure. There's a kernel of a good idea in the story, but the execution of that idea is completely muddled by dead-end story lines, bad filming, and directionless directing. Which is too bad, because some of the stuff here is pretty emotionally loaded, like the scene of Neil sobbing after losing several days to his fever and picking up his camera to try and bring back some sense of who he used to be and the things he once loved. It's a heartbreaking scene of loss and fear that, in a better film, would be a real gut punch. Ah well. It's on Netflix if you feel like giving it a watch, though I wouldn't be married to the idea of watching the full movie." 
" Gem of a Movie","Well, this movie did come as a super surprise to me. Before i started I hardly expected anything out of the movie, thinking it must be one of those crappy zombie wanna-be movies, but 15-20 minutes into the movie I was just engrossed into it. Its a well written, directed and acted movie, kudos to the team.The movie is about a wildlife photographer who gets bitten by an insect while shooting and his transformation into a zombie. It shows the whole process, emotions and fight of a person while turning man to zombie.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is into the Zombie genre and is looking forward to a good zombie movie." 
" Rise Of The Zombie is Compelling and Astonishing!!!","Those who are unaware about the 'Zombie' term, It means animated corpse resurrected by mystical means such as Witchcraft. At least, This is what Wikipedia says. The 'Zombie' which we have been introduced with (Especially by the "West" culture) means 'Living-Dead'. Zombies doesn't behave like normal human being, As they are Half Dead and Half Alive. Zombies cannot eat normal food, As they eat all 'Living Ones'. Especially Humans, Animals and Insects. In short, A Zombie means 'Monster'.Till date, You have witnessed Horror Films which has Woman in a White Saree who is a Spirit and she is out for a Revenge. But here's a Film called Rise Of The Zombie which takes Horror Genre into totally different level altogether. Authentically, Rise Of The Zombie is India's first-ever Zombie Genre film which the makers intent to make as a Zombie-Series-Trilogy. Rise Of The Zombie is a First-Part from the Zombie-Trilogy.Let me also "Warn" you Rise Of The Zombie is not at all for Weak-Heart people.Neil Parker (Luke Kenny) is a passionate wildlife photographer who pays more attention to his wildlife than his human life. As a result his relationships with the real world suffer. When his girlfriend Vinny (Kirti Kulhari) walks out on him, He resigns himself to isolation and nature. But a chance occurrence changes all that. While doing the Mother-Nature's photo-shoot, Neil get's bitten by something. Slowly story follow Neil's journey into a darkness that has to be seen to be believed. A monster that seems to be rising out of the depths of desolation and agony, soulless, depraved and out of control.Luke Kenny has performed his part very Brilliantly. As an actor, He is well-aware when he has to go Natural and when he has to be Materialistic. Luke Kenny makes you believe the Pain, Sorrow and Thirst of a Monster thru his performance. Kirti Kulhari is another Mind-Blowing actress with her amazing acting skills. I fail to understand why Film makers ignore superb talent such as Kirti. Kindly note her in the first (Introductory) scene where she is upset and worried at the same time for the whereabouts of her lover. Ashwin Mushran and Benjamin Gilani are good in a small but Brief roles. Their role continues in the second part of the Trilogy (Of course).Directors Devaki Singh and Luke Kenny both have chosen a very Complex-Horror script (Written by Devaki Singh) and made it in a very Compelling and Astonishing way. The first hour is little dragging at few points, But a special tap on the shoulders of DOP Murzy Pagdiwala who keeps you hooked to your seats with his masterpiece camera-work. Surprisingly, The film also has a wonderful musical score which gives you an International Feel. The Editing is tight and sharp. You might find lot of Silent Explanations in the scenes, But as i mentioned earlier, This one is the first part of Trilogy.Rise Of The Zombie works for it's unique concept which speaks Fearlessly on the Big Screen. Hats off to makers Devaki Singh and Luke Kenny and the entire team for making us understand that Indian Horror has much more to offer.Don't you 'Dare' miss this honest effort." 
" Wow Bollywood should be ashamed of this ultra crap + Garbage","First of all I am BIG not BIG HUGE fan of Zombie movies.

" Interesting take on the modern zombie folklore","Interesting take on the modern zombie folklore. This movie well done for a indie movie. . . Some acting was better than others, overall entertaining. . . Special effects were good. . . The premise borders on true events, such as in Haiti. (See the movie Serpent and the Rainbow.) . . The Western world has gone hook, line & sinker for the modern zombie genre. . . Brought to us by George Romero, Zack Snyder, Tom Savini. (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead) . . That when a movie comes out that goes into a different direction that the established formula, people cry foul. . . I's a good movie, I'll watch it again, if you haven't see it, watch it. for yourself and form your own opinions." 
" My mother's advice.","My mum always said "if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."So I won't.Thank you." 
" Just awful","Writing, acting, story, flow, every aspect of this movie was terrible. Finishing watching it was painfully hard work. I've seen every zombie movie I can find and this was 100% the worst."
