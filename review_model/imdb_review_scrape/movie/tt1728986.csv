" It is enjoyable at the condition to leave your brain at home.","Watched "BOL BACHCHAN". It is a typical Rohit Shetty's film. Just go to theater with your heart and leave the brain at home. Then you will enjoy the movie. It is a paisa vasool movie. It bores in the starting 45 minutes but after that, you will start enjoying it. Rohit Shetty has a different style of filming movie and always tries to show something different in action. He proves himself right again. Music is as usual weak of Rohit Shetty's films. One track could have been popular "CHALAO NA NAINO KE VAAN RE" but I think it was not well promoted. Screenplay by Yunus Sajawal is weak. It is jerky. Transition is not very smooth. It is forced. Dialogues by Farhad -Sajid are awesome at places but same time somewhere worst too. Ajay Devgan is marvelous in action as well as in comedy scenes. Abhishek Bachchan is irreplaceable as Abbas Ali. He has proved himself after "DOSTANA" that no one can carry a gay character better than him. He is simply mind-boggling and very enjoyable as Abbas Ali. When he comes as Abbas Ali movie sparks. Asin is a too good actress but totally wasted in this film. She does not have any good scene, so she can show her performance. I am shocked with Krishna Abhishek. I am a big fan of him in Comedy circus. I just laugh and love to watch him. There is some magic when he performs in Comedy at small screen but in this film, I am disappointed. His magic is missing in big screen. After all it is enjoyable." 
" Don't Watch!!","Please don't watch the movie. Just a waste of money and time. There is nothing in this movie that is watchable. Songs are not good, the movie is a remake of a classic movie Golmaal which is narrated very badly. Ajay Devgans role in the movie is to bash the villains and mobs in the city and walk away in a slow motion. I don't know how can it make sense?? The songs come in the place where they are not at all needed. Romantic songs in an tragic scenario. Abhishek is just a gay and he'll always be like that since Dostana i guess. Prachi Desai has given a decent performance in the movie but still something is missing that makes her a good actor. Asin has given a performance like in every movie, we can't expect anything good from that girl. Overall my rating is 1/10." 
" Rohit Shetty's version of the old and classic Golmaal with an Aneez Bazmee climax disappoints.",""Boy under armpit, hyper city noise pollution" & "I will make him remember milk no 6 " define Bol BachchanThe movie is about a village and its care-taker Prithvi aka Ajay Devgn. Asrani invites AB aka Abaas Ali to his village where Prithvi gives him a job as his super-man. (No, I am not kidding, these are the words used). What follows is a poor remake of the classic Golmaal. Twin AB, twin mothers, twin bathrooms and what not! Some dialogues like,"Pest control yourself", "A brother in need is a sister indeed" sound crass.Ajay as the village's anna-datta and an English lover is the only positive that the movie offers. ABs Abhishek side is plain simple and Abbas' side is crass; straight out of Dostana's books. Krishna irritates to the core. Asin & Prachi simply add to the glamor quotient. Isn't Asrani tired of doing the same role again and again? The songs are passable. The climax is straight out of Aneez Bazmee's No Entry & Welcome, hanging on a tree. Rohit Shetty did a great job with Golmaal-1 but all his later ventures are turning more silly than comic. Although this one isn't as bad as other movies of such genre, this one is not worth a cinema ticket. Conversely, if you have the appetite for such cinema, get ready to be treated !" 
" Kudos to Abhishek Bachchan!","Bol Bachchan is a typical Rohit Shetty movie with a little more substance. It has cheap jokes - this time on lousy understanding of English by Prithviraj - character played by Ajay. It has those characteristic action sequences - people and vehicles flying in the air. It has few songs, which are light and melodious.But this film should be remembered for an actor who has worked out of his skin to entertain audience - Abhishek Bachchan. I have never seen Abhishek show so many emotions in a single film. He is good at comic roles - if we see Dostana and now Bol Bachchan. Action sequences and sharing chemistry with females is where I find him a little uncomfortable. He should not be compared to his dad now. He has carved an audience for himself." 
" Hope this trash from a Hit director stops the avoidable trend of remaking the Cult Classics of Hindi Cinema.","When a director is back after delivering a fabulous string of 4 big blockbusters in a row, then it's indeed going to be a hugely stressful event for him undoubtedly. Because not only the viewers but the industry also is bound to expect a lot from his project keeping in mind the excellent track record of his successes. And when further, the same director is back with a remake of one of the Top 10 All Time Favourite Comedies of Indian Cinema then obviously the expectations are going to reach sky high.So here we have director Rohit Shetty striking again with his updated version of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Cult Classic GOLMAAL, to which he tries to give his own twists and turns instead of copying the original as a true fan. In fact this very intelligent step of the director remains the only plus point going in his favour, as there are not many in this world (including myself) who would appreciate seeing an updated revised version of that incomparable original classic having a tremendous repeat value of itself.Now what Rohit does in his BOL BACHCHAN is that he re-writes a completely new & fresh script around the basic storyline of the original GOLMAAL and never makes the viewer feel that they are watching just a pure re-make. On a positive note, this is exactly how it should be done as there is no way that any director can re-live a classic film like GOLMAAL after more than 3 decades with the same elegance. So though we have the same plot being worked upon here, still Rohit tries to rope in some new characters, more comic mannerisms and few more forcibly funny sequences to make his BOL BACHCHAN a completely fresh film based on a famous masterpiece.But unfortunately, the sad part of all this hard work done by the director and his team is that they hugely fail in the process and their newly added ingredients in the re-written script of GOLMAAL simply do not work or fall flat. In other words, the last 20 minutes of the film, even make you wonder that Is this really a Rohit Shetty film running on the screen? Moreover, the disappointment doesn't stop on the writing and execution level only as all the actors in it also remain a big let-down throughout which was not at all expected in a film by the director, who is known to have the pulse of his audience.BB starts off unlike a comedy and surprisingly there is no great funny stuff to be enjoyed in its opening 40 minutes. With such an uninteresting start, all the high spirits of watching it actually turn negative and this continues till the intermission working against all the expectations from the Hit team of Rohit Shetty and Ajay Devgan. In the second half too, the director tries to add more elements than required which actually result in a poor mess. Particularly the inclusion of a gay character in the script remains the weakest part of the film as neither the actor (Abhishek) nor his director are able to handle it well.Honestly, I only enjoyed watching Neeraj Vohra &Prachi Desai alone, despite of the presence of all the know actors in this big banner project. Ajay, more or less remains in his SINGHAM hangover only & Abhishek tries too hard to be funny without any success. Frankly I neither could laugh on the English dialogues of Ajay nor on the weird kind of Kathak dancing of Abhishek which was really awful. Asin is just there to look beautiful and Archana Puran Singh does make a sincere effort to generate some laughter. But overall they all are not able to put up a good show collectively. Plus I remained hugely dissatisfied from the supporting act of Krishna, who unarguably was given a role much below his actual caliber.BB also falters in its action and cinematography department as whatever happens on the screen looks like 'all seen before' in the director's earlier films only. Its high time Rohit should realize that he cannot use the same kind of camera-work, slow motions, fighting stunts, flying people and car blasts in all his films repeatedly. Musically also the film doesn't have anything great to offer apart from one interesting song "Chalao Na Naino Se Baan Re". Just like the film, its title track also goes over the top showing the over-confidence of both its actors and the director.To be straight, BOL BACHCHAN is just not a Rohit Shetty film full of light entertainment as compared to some of his previous ventures. I loved watching his GOLMAAL 3, ALL THE BEST and SINGHAM, but BOL BACHCHAN is simply not anything even close to these. Interestingly one sequence of the film (when Archna Puran Singh is introduced in a Nautanki), also reminded me of a similar scene in Mukul Anand's HUM, wherein Kader Khan is discovered in an exactly similar situation by both Anupam Kher & Anu Kapoor.The director revealed his fascination towards the cult classic GOLMAAL (1979) when he started using the word in the title of his chain of films beginning with GOLMAL: FUN UNLIMITED in 2006. But now when he has re- made the classic officially, he simply misses the opportunity and comes up with a project which will be surely remembered as a "Bad Attempt" in his career.However, there is one silver lining in this black cloud that after BOL BACHCHAN, perhaps the silly and avoidable trend of re-making the golden classics of 70s & 80s would come to an end. Because if this doesn't stop here, then be ready for seeing many more such trash remakes of those cinematic masterpieces, which surely indicate the emergence of a "Creative Block" in our Hindi Film Industry." 
" Mix of Hrishida + David Dhawan","Rohit Shetty after hit comedies turned to action with SINGHAM(2011) which was a runaway hit. Rohit Shetty's ALL THE BEST was a lame adaptation of Hrishida's earlier classics. BOL BACHCHAN is inspired by Hrishida's GOLMAAL(1979) which however is modified, Just the basic concept is the same and some twists. I wont be foolish to compare it to the classic as RS is no Hrishida Bol Bachchan doesn't only resemble GOLMAAL but the story has been done to death by David Dhawan in COOLIE No.1, Saajan Chale Sasural and Chor Machaiye Shor. There are many scenes copied with dialogs from Chor Machaiye Shor(2002).Like the scene where Ajay and Neeraj Vohra lend in Abhishek's house and also the dialogue by Abhishek Izzat kam ho jaati hai. Also several more scenes are similar to CMS which was a flop. BOL BACHCHAN's biggest asset is the dialogs especially the half broken English dialogs for Ajay Devgn. To start with the film starts with an item number with Amitabh, Abhishek and Ajay Devgan in their own voices and then Bachchan gives a warning that only his name is in the film. Seconds later we are introduced to Small B in a simple avatar. Then Ajay Devgn is introduced with all the slow motion shots, loud background score.etc Every scene of Devgn is shot in the same manner which gets repetitive soon. Rohit Shetty seems to have not forgotten SINGHAM or perhaps he intendedly let the hangover of that film creep in, Ajay's character is moulded like mix of Utpal Dutt and Singham character. some scenes have the same background music of Singham too, even the action scenes are similar with the same over the top slow motion punches, the extras leaping slowly after being hit. There are some funny scenes like the first scene by Ajay-Abhishek, even the scene where Abhishek cooks an alibi about his name and his brother later. Abhas's intro is quite funny though long drawn. Abhishek's dance is funny. Also the scene where all his 3 mothers arrive on the scene. The best part is the hinglish dialogs inspired from TASHAN but work well. The film keeps reminding us the GOLMAAL reference, from the play act which is named GOLMAAL which also has comedians VIP imitating Utpal Dutt(better then Ajay Devgn imitating Utpal in 1 scene) and also a scene showing Golmaal(1979) on TV which is a copy paste of a similar scene from COOLIE No.1(strangely the same movie was shown there too) The second half has some funny scenes too but some scenes don't work too, like the forced Asin lookalike track, Rohit Shetty tries to cram in too much just for the sake of laughs which is boring at many places, like in many scenes we suddenly have Abhishek and Krishna break into some weird jigs which don't work. The climax too is long drawn and isn't impressive much. Also there is the usual masala of Rohit Shetty which is playing with cars, blasting cars, buses.etc which is repetitive.Direction is average Music by Himesh is okay, CHADAON NA NAIN is good, Chori se nazrein by Ajay-Atul is the best track Dialogues are awesome, especially those mouthed by Ajay DevgnAjay Devgn with a tattooed torso(which doesn't gel with his villager role though) with a well built body looks great. He plays his part with a mix of the SINGHAM Angry Young Man act and also mixes it with comedy and does it very well, for an actor who was initially awful in comedy, slowly his comedy is getting much better though at times his act does get boring. His high pitched baritone dialogue delivery is also at times irritating, yet he does a good job especially when it comes to delivering the English lines. Abhishek in his first attempt perhaps in full over the top comedy tries his best, he does a good job especially in the gay act, as Abhishek too he plays the serious scenes very well, in comedy too he is good at times but at times tends to look uncomfortable. Prachi Desai looks cute and does a decent job Asin however annoys with her dubbed voice Amongst rest Krishna gets lot of scope and does the most of it, in his second innings thanks to Comedy Circus, after the dismissal debut in YEH KAISI MOHABBAT HAI(2002) which is forgotten, Govinda's nephew does a good job though at times he does get too loud and jarring VIP is however releagated to the backseat. Archana Puran Singh is superb in her act thankfully not hamming it up with her shreaky voice like she does mostly. Though not as great as the late Dina Pathak in the original. Asrani was a regular in Hrishida films hence it's strange seeing him in a lame remake of GOLMAAL which was one of the best films by Hrishida. he is as usual. Neeraj Vohra after recently making small appearances finally gets a meaty role which reminds us of Om Puri in CMS, he does a great job He gets most of the best dialogs too. The villain is okay" 
" Bol Bachchan is a laugh riot","Superb movie.Nit & clean comedy movie BOL BACHCHAN. I just watched the movie. Too good comedy. Bol Bachchan is a laugh riot. After a long long time a hilarious comedy me has been released. The main plus points of the movie is the fantastic dialogue of the movie, the funny English of Ajay devgn makes really laugh everybody all time in the movie. Beside this there are also so many things which makes everyone really laugh. Ajay Devgan and Rohit shetty pair proved again that only this pair can make the best commercial movies. Ajay Devgn's acting and comedy(mainly of wrong English) are too good.Abhishek Bachchan's coming timing also very good. A full entertaining package for everybody with family. Going to be a super-duper hit." 
" Time-Pass!","Rohit Shetty's Much Awaited 'Bol Bachchan' is a Time-Pass Fare, that shouldn't be taken seriously. Its strictly pop-corn entertainment, that doesn't even attempt to be remotely remarkable. If having fun at the movies is what you're looking for, then 'Bol Bachchan' is waiting for you.'Bol Bachchan', inspired by the classic 'Gol Maal', tells the story of how one man's lie, leads to a puzzle of confusions. 'Bol Bachchan' has a hilarious first-hour, with each passing scene standing out. The interval point, is simply superb. However, the second-hour loses pace & the climax seems a bit stretched. Yunus Sajawal's Screenplay is funny & entertaining, but it definitely could've been stronger in the latter hour. A Special Mention for the dialogue written by Sajid-Farhad. The dialogue are simply hilarious! Rohit Shetty's Direction is good. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are efficient. Action-Sequences are over-the-top. Music by Himesh Reshammiya & Ajay-Atul, is energetic.Performance-Wise: Ajay Devgn is excellent, yet again! He very playfully plays his part & delivers the funniest lines with ease. His broken English is sure to bring the house down. Abhishek Bachchan does an equally good job. The actor scores as Abhishek & is simply flawless as Abbas Ali. Asin & Prachi Desai get limited scope & they both deliver mediocre performances. Krushna Abhishek, Asrani, Neeraj Vora & Archana Puran Singh are simply fantastic in supporting roles. Amitabh Bachchan appears in the title track.On the whole, 'Bol Bachchan' works till it lasts." 
" A delicate balance of funny and cringe-worthy moments","To the old, sweet, amazingly funny, classic comedy, Golmaal (Hrishikesh Mukherjee, 1979), apply the Higgs Boson particle to it ie attempt to make it a 'mass' film, an 'entertainer'. So add liberal doses of silliness, unnecessary plot complications, shrillness, crassness, slow motion fight sequences and many, many blown up vehicles. Also add a few sequences & a few jokes that really make you laugh. Just pray that the cringe-worthy moments don't outnumber the LOL moments & that depends entirely on your sensibilities. The broad outline of the original story is retained. Ajay Devgn, local tough & rich landlord, employs Abhishek as a supervisor. Unfortunately, Abhishek, a Muslim in the film, has to pretend to be a Hindu in front of Ajay. One lie leads to another and soon he has to invent a gay, Muslim identical step brother, a mother, the mother's identical twin sister etc. Prachi, Ajay's sister, is Abhishek's love interest. Asin, Abhishek's sister, is Ajay's love interest. And Jeetu Verma is there as Ajay's evil cousin only so that muscles can be rippled and bones broken. Neeraj Vora as Ajay's sidekick and Asrani and Krishna as Abhishek's uncle and son, respectively are there to attempt to wring a few more laughs from you. Ajay's character likes to speak English and mangle it beyond belief, and this ability provides many of the comic, funny moments of the film. You watch in awe, wondering what he will come up with next, a bit like when you watch Sidhu comment on cricket. It works in short doses and appears a bit stretched in the second half. 'When elders get cozy, youngsters don't put nosy' or 'Thank you for the Complan Boy' (compliment) don't seem rib tickling but given Ajay's fulsome delivery and the situation, it does generate quite a few laughs. Abhishek plays his two roles quite straight, pun intended. The sequence where the gay character has to dance to a medley of songs in unison with two of Ajay's henchmen is crass but makes you laugh in parts. Asin is strangely muted in the film, while Prachi also has a small role, without much meat. The movie is too long, the songs aren't great, the fight sequences too similar to what we've already seen from Rohit Shetty's earlier films. There is a vision here to make it a comedy for the masses and judging by the loud laughs from the audience, he's got it right. I feel, with the same cast, just keeping it along the lines of the original could've worked just as well, but I fear I would be in the minority in the industry. Would love it if there was a face-off between an intelligent, well made comedy (like a Vicky Donor, Khosla ka Ghosla) & a 'mass' one like this, with similar level of star power in both. I wonder which film would then have a bigger box office ? More at www.apurvbollywood.blogspot.in" 
" Waste of time","Bakwaas story... In spite of this, very good direction by Rohit Shetty. Very good acting by Ajay Devgan, Abishek Bachchan. Koja Abbas was good too.Scriptwriters for the movie should get the worst scriptwriting award for this movie... Even a fifth grader could come up with a better story than this. But Rohit Shetty has done an excellent job of directing a bad story. Since the story is absolutely worst, it seems Rohit Shetty has painstakingly gone through the trouble of giving the movie a life. If the movie was directed by a bad director, the movie would be a total flop. Kudos to Rohit for his brilliance.Ajay Devgan was very humorous with his English." 
" A Must Watch !","Ajay Devgan and Rohit Shetty did it again. A awesome humor movie with nice songs.the typical Rajasthan look with colorful clothes to language is also cool. Ajay Devgan is as usual cool in comedy as well as action. And many comedy circus Comedians even got chance to work in movie with Krushna as in Lead supporting actor. And as most of you must have got the trailer of Ajay Devgan's English from the promo video's, believe me his English is the most funniest part in movie. Abhishek bachchan did a good job too in acting and after years Himesh Reshamiya is back with awesome song.Just go for it and enjoy." 
" Laughed out Loud!!","Yes!! this movie is awesome, and with very good comedy. In short movie has a good story, the crew is excellent, and fantastic acting by Ajay Devgn, and Abhishek Bachchan. Sometimes you just to have come to cinema with open mind. Don't over-think much about this film, as it just goes with the flow :). Ajay Devgan and Rohit shetty pair once again proved that only this pair can make the best commercial movies. Ajay Devgn's acting and comedy( just mainly of using wrong English words) is too good. Abhishek Bachchan's acting timing is also very good. Its a full entertaining package for everybody with family. Prachi Desai looks cute in the movie. This movie is going to be a super-hit. Awesome 10 out of 10!" 
" Lesser the expectations, more the entertainment","It is a known fact that Rohit Shetty is synonymous with nonsense. With a fight composer's blood running in his veins, he spares no penny in over-the-top action sequences that would put Tollywood to shame. His comedy is bi-polar as well, ranging from inane and retarded to occasionally, genuinely funny. Music has never been tasteful in any of his films nor has the importance of characterization and plot. After his career highlight, 'Singham', Shetty partners with Ajay Devgan (also co-producer) in this outlandish remake of 'Golmaal' (Shetty can't get over it) which would be as forgettable as his previous films were it not for some funny dialogues, situations and Ajay Devgan.Abbas Ali (Abhishek Bachchan) is running out of luck in Delhi as he loses the case around his ancestral property. Along with his sister, Sania (Asin), he pays heed to Shastri's (Asrani) advice and moves to Ranakpur to work under Prithviraj (Ajay Devgan). Unfortunately, in a brave attempt to save a child from drowning, Abbas opens the gates to a controversial temple and after the tension around Prithvi's family feud cools, his friend had no choice but to introduce Abbas to Prithviraj as a hindu, named Abhishek Bachchan. From hereon begins a series of goof-ups, cover-ups and unabashed lies that conceal Abbas' true identity. However genuine his intentions may be, he would always have to confront Prithvi's stringent policy of honesty with fear. Ajay Devgan is the major reason you would bear this film. His comic timing, expressions and dialogues are the saving grace. With equal ease he transforms into the angry Singham version when enraged. Abhishek Bachchan is passable. Comedy isn't his expertise and he does try hard but in an unconvincing manner. Others could've played his role better but then they're not a Bachchan. Asin looks beautiful but has little to offer in her acting, Asrani was splendid and Krishna Abhishek is hilarious especially when he weeps in nervousness. Archana Puran Singh was hilarious switching between two characters and Neeraj Vora, although loud, portrayed some natural comedy. The film works in many of its dialogues, confusing situations and being a spoof of several films. Where it falls flat into Rohit Shetty (nonsense) territory is its overdone mockery of the English language, the ridiculous action sequences, the wasteful song and dance and the immature climax that drags the film to unnerving lengths. With smaller expectations, the film delivers the goods. Popcorn entertainment is what we can categorize it as and after a few laughs, you won't regret spending the time and money. 6.81 on a scale of 1-10." 
" Simply funny and Entertaining movie","now logic,no pressure on brain.. just watch--> interpret --> laugh ;) spending on this type of movie is truly worthier . Direct translation of Hindi Dialog to English . Amazing . Those who like fun, funny, laugh therapy.. just watch it. 2+ hrs full entertained so putting this type of review...Cast : Ajay Devgn, Abhishek Bachchan, Asin Thottumkal, Prachi Desai, Asrani, Archana Puran Singh, Neeraj Vora, Krushna Abhishek, Jeetu Verma... Director :Rohit Shetty Producer :Ajay Devgn, Dhillin Mehta Story : The film is inspired by Hrishikesh Mukherjee's 1979 classic comedy Gol Maal. Genre :Comedy" 
" bast of the Rohit Shetty Ajay Devgn and abhishek bachan....","i don't see no other way to make batter this film..this is really good comedy movie..ajay has prove again that he can play any role he want and he make that role perfect..Bol Bachchan will undoubtedly draw in fans of muscleman Ajay Devgn (Singham) and his longtime collaborator, director Rohit Shetty (Golmaal: Fun Unlimited), for a healthy run at the box office. But its biggest surprise is Abhishek Bachchan, who reveals an unexpectedly subtle side and a talent for verbal humor in one of his best performances to date. Rohit Shetty yet again displays his penchant for picking the right actors for the right roles in Bol Bachchan. Ajay Devgn as the angry young Prithvi excels in a role that seems absolutely tailor-made for him. Abhishek Bachchan is entirely believable as the helpless simpleton Abbas. Asin scorches the screen as a desi girl with loads of attitude. Prachi Desai comes up with yet another fine performance in this enjoyable flick. Bol Bachchan also benefits from its slick storyline, developed by Farhan Yunus and Sajawal Sajid. Sajid has come with real strong dialogues too, which would definitely be lapped up by the masses. Screenplay by Yunus Sajawal is equally efficient. Editor Steven H. Bernard and art director Narendra Rahurikar also lend a distinct crispness and stylish feel to the movie." 
" A movie for the entire family that can make you laugh and laugh till you drop!","Comedy-of-errors has been the most explored areas in drollery. The humor growing out of false identities has been explored by many directors and producers in Bollywood since its inception. Some very popular films based on this sub-genre are "Golmaal" (Hrishikesh Mukherjee), Coolie No.1 (David Dhawan) and the Housefull series by Sajid Khan. Rohit Shetty, the director of the hilarious Golmaal trilogy, also tried his hand at making a film based on comedy of errors by making the movie "All The Best". The film was a success. However, Rohit had created a brand out of Golmaal movies. Whenever we talk of Rohit the first thing that comes to our minds are the hilarious characters in the movie that provided us many laugh-out-loud moments. Rohit has also shown us a glimpse of his expertise in the action genre with Singham. Now, he tries his hand once again at the comedy-of-errors genre with his latest flick Bol Bachchan, which is a rip-off of the cult classic Hrishikesh Mukherjee film, Golmaal.In the movie, Ajay Devgn plays a wrestler and the most powerful man in the village. His character has been inspired from the character essayed by late Utpal Dutt in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Golmaal. The character played by Amol Palekar in Golmaal has been portrayed by Abhishek Bachchan in the new movie. However, there are a few changes that have been incorporated into the characters. While we saw Utpal Dutt had an affinity towards pure Hindi Language in Golmaal, Ajay Devgn's character is so much influenced by English that he translates every proverb in Hindi into English. This makes up for some hilarious one-liners like "when the elders getting cozy, young don't get nosy" or "he will die Tommy's death"! Amol Palekar had played the role of a singing teacher and also posed as his twin brother. Abhishek Bachchan, in the movie Bol Bachchan, portrays the role of a dance teacher and also poses as his twin brother. To make the character more genuine and in tune with the audience, Abhishek has played the usual sissy act when posing as the dance teacher.Rohit Shetty has followed the 1979 classic to the hilt. That is the main reason why his movie has not wandered off at any point. He was aware that it was pointless to try and be better than the original cult classic, therefore he sticks to the pilot act and has kept the classic moments and characters intact. Therefore, in Bol Bachchan as well, we will see Archana Puran Singh (who plays the role of Abhishek's mother and also poses as her twin) entering through the back door, just like Dina Pathak's character in the 1979 movie.To make the movie more grasping, Rohit Shetty has included one character in his movie and that is of Ajay's rival cousin from the neighboring village, played with elegance by Neeraj Vora. This gives Rohit a scope to try his trademark action sequences which involves blowing up cars and mindless fight scenes. However, sometimes we feel that he might have over-done in a few scenes. Certain scenes like Abhishek's dance sequence before interval could have been curtailed. The non sense English by Ajay seems a bit over-the-board and after some time, one fails to grasp on to the humor that his one-liners present.Nonetheless, Rohit Shetty does not complicate the script and keeps it simple. There is no slapstick humor and the scenes are genuinely to be laughed at. All the characters have been portrayed with perfection. The most notable name will be Abhishek Bachchan who plays the role of his life. Final Verdict, Bol Bachchan is a family entertainer and will certainly make you laugh and laugh till you drop!"
