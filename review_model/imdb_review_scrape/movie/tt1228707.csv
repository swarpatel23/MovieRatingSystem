" Can't describe in words how bad it is!!!","I am really astonished not to find this movie in IMDb bottom 100. I mean people, come on, you gotta vote to honor this movie with a place in the list. It can easily be said to be one of the worst( if not the worst ) Bollywood movies of the decade.The acting, directing, screenplay, songs, cinematography all simultaneously *beep* big time. I was curious to find how Mithun-son performs on the big screen. Yes, he delivers awfully with a disgusting voice, effeminate character, overacting, horrible dancing and pathetic action scenes. The other members also did not perform well. I am really shocked to find Rahul Dev has starred in this movie. Though he performed well I rather watch him in his other movies. The plot was meaningless. I can't believe a 25 year grown up can't wear a shirt or wear both the socks in one leg unknowingly!!!!! The murder mystery could easily be worst and most predictable ones the Bollywood has ever come up with. In short, you must watch it to find how bad it is and do vote to secure its place in the bottom 100 list. I even can't believe they put such a hilarious tag line for the movie "Crime is a disease, meet the cure"!!!" 
" so bad that its unmissable!","Jimmy is that rare thing - a film so bad that it's good. True Bollywood connoisseurs have a list of these, which usually includes Sheetal's Honey and Manoj Kumar's Clerk . These are films that exist in a parallel universe. These are films that feel delirious, like the director was either smoking something strong or was suffering from some tropical malady. Basically these are films that become sources of pure, unintentional comedy. Jimmy is that and more. It's a blast from the past. Director Raj N. C. Sippy transports you straight to the 1980s, when he was making films like Satte Pe Satta and Shiva Ka Insaaf . So Jimmy, played by Mimoh Chakraborty, is a virtuous son who is an automobile engineer by day and a DJ by night. His loving mother follows him around with breakfast but he never has time to eat it because he is too busy trying to repay his dead father's loan. They don't have much money but the mother serves breakfast wearing pearls. Jimmy falls in love with the worst car driver in the world. She hits him three times and even breaks his leg but soon they are singing songs. Only she's a rich man's daughter and of course trouble ensues. This is the kind of movie in which villains laugh and glare. The dialogue is comically bad. But my favorite moment came when the girl's father told a nasty suitor that his daughter cannot marry him. He screamed " you are a rejected person." There is no craft to speak of here and the camera-work is perhaps the only thing worse than the acting. So the only question is: how does Mimoh fare? Well as the advertising promised us: he does have dance in his DNA. Mithun Chakraborty was once hailed as this nation's disco dancer and his son can burn up the dance floor. Unfortunately for him he wants to be an actor. For that, he's going to need everything from a script to a better voice to a stylist. Many hours after the film, I was still wondering what was going on with Mimoh's hair - at one point, it goes from straight to curly in one scene. And who selected his clothes? In a hospital scene, he is wearing a red T-shirt that says 'Let me show you my pony'! What separates Jimmy from the routinely bad movies that hit multiplexes every week is its total disconnect from Bollywood reality or any other reality known to mankind. I cannot recommend that you spend 200 rupees on it but do see it when it's out on DVD, preferably after you have imbibed some intoxicants yourself. I haven't laughed this much all month." 
" A laugh riot about Jimmy","This is such a laugh riot unlike DeshDrohi which released the same year in 2008." 
" Jimmy lacks soul, MImoh promises!","I've been a big fan of Mithun Chakraborty, and his son Mimoh makes his silver screen debut with 'Jimmy'On the whole 'Jimmy' is an average fare... the film's script is outdated. Director Raj N Sippy and Writer Ranbir Pushp are the villains here. Minus Mimoh, nothing really works in this venture. Watch it only for Mimoh!Performances: Mimoh makes an excellent debut, He's a astounding dancer, He acts well, but he needs to loose weight and work on his voice. Vivana looks pretty but she doesn't get much to do. Zulfi Syed leaves you speechless with his performance, He hams it up. Rahul Dev gets his work right, despite an ill written role. Shakti Kapoor isn't in command. Adi Irani, Vikas Kalantri, Eshaan Khan Valabh Vyas try hard.Jimmy Jimmy Aaja Aaja {I mean to Mimoh}" 
" Movie Was Terrible but its Mithun's Son so cool","I was looking forward to watching Jimmy, but since it was not showing in any Cinema in London. I had no other option but to watch it on DVD piracy, which ain't too bad. Let me Firstly say the movie had a horrible script and the dialogue and screenplay was so old fashion. This movie will not appeal to anybody of tis generation, this is something Mimoh should of understood. The Actress in this film is there to help launch Mimoh. All eyes are on Mimoh in this film. He is a fantastic Dancer, but his acting needs a little improving. I am sure that he can mature in the near future, but he will have to lose weight and have a new hairstyle. Mimoh was worth watching but this movie is poor. Good luck to Mimoh in the future and just wanna say Mithun (of 80s) is a class act of Bollywood." 
" Amazing show my Mimoh....Mind Blowing Movie!!","The movie starts with a bang....and it hits you straight at your face. What amazing performance...be it acting, dance or action scenes. After a long time I have seen such a mind blowing performance. Mimoh rocks...not as good as his father but if he works hard he can deliver a GUNDA performance (some people will get what I want to say). There are some minor issues with the technicality of the movie but overall the movie was great. An award winning performance by Mimoh. I am now a huge fan of him. Will be looking forward for his future performances. I hope he wins an award this year for the performance in this movie. Hope he at least gets best debut award for this movie."
