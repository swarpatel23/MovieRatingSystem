" Nothing remarkable","The wikipedia article of this film says it was a disaster...no doubt.The story is about a young medical student who is kept forcefully in the house of a local don as his concubine,and when his younger brother arrives here to assist him in his business, he finds the girl and pities her, and does all he can for her, amidst gangsters, cops and his own conscience.The truth is, this film is too simple for anyone to watch. The best thing is Manoj Bajpai's acting, and the ending track - that's all. Everything else is alright but nothing remarkable...the cinematography, direction -nothing.It is NOT a bad film, and CAN be watched, but I don't see how this film could've run, and I don't understand why money and resources are wasted on such films." 
" What a miss by its makers!","A film like LANKA can easily be compared with an important catch in a Cricket match where the ball just pops out of the hands of the player attempting it. The phrase is used here to describe the film because it has everything in it, needed for a good film but still the makers are unable to utilize its each potential merit in the right way.Titled LANKA the film does take its inspiration from 'Ramayana' to some extent but then every Indian film has something or the other close to the Epic's divine story as its full of very emotional and heart-warming content. However in the present version the emphasis is on RAVAN â€“ VIBHISHAN relationship with a different added angle of their love interest. The story revolves around two brothers and a girl with whom the elder brother is having an open relationship in which he keeps exploiting her physically as a Keep. The younger brother being a silent observer of this relationship is not able to bear the injustice and slowly develops a liking towards the girl owned by his influential brother leading to his revolt.Now the basic plot and other elements thrown in by the writers in the film have everything ranging from love, hatred, exploitation, injustice, sex, revolt, confrontation and even police nexus with the influential. In addition there is also a plot of regional caste differences and village rivalry roped in for the smaller centers. But despite of having so much on paper to exploit on screen, the film fails to deliver and comes out to be just a decent first attempt by its director Maqbool Khan.Though there are some well directed and acted sequences in the film which count, but sadly they come after long gaps which reduces their impact on the audience. The script moves at a very slow pace, becoming uninteresting after a while leading to boredom. The specially inserted Item song and another slow number do not provide any help too and remain ineffective. The writers leave so many questions not explained properly in the narration, like why the girl's family is surrendering so easily and regularly to the ugly and unethical demands of the big brother or Why the hero doesn't take any action throughout the movie to save his love? May be he was asked to save it for the climax, which again is nothing impressive from any angle.Yet there is something to cheer in LANKA and that's the superlative performance of Manoj Bajpai who once again proves that he can always leave a mark even if the script of his film is a big letdown. The Cinematography also serves as the second positive point in the film after Manoj. Arjan as the younger brother tries to talk through his eyes successfully but I still felt he could have been much better. Tia doesn't disappoint with a pleasing presence on the screen. Yashpal Sharma is excellent as usual but if only the script had given them all something exceptional to perform, then LANKA could have been a worth watching venture.As for now it can only be watched if you are a true fan of Manoj Bajpai, as the actor remains the single asset of the film unarguably."
