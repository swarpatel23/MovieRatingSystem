" Feroz Khan deserves Best Villain Award","Assalam O Alaikum! Since my childhood, I am a die hard fan of Mr. Feroz Khan especially the movies made by his directorial skills. He was and is ahead of making best technical films. (Late Mukul Anand was after him). Janasheen has a flaw in screenplay otherwise it has the best performance by Mr. Feroz Khan, a great camerawork especially in the motor bike race scene which has been seen first time on the Hindi Cinema and Sr. Khan has one more feather in his cap of presenting the Car Race scene way back in "Apradh" (1972). Beautiful Locales which he captured almost all around the world. Fardeen and Celina were good and Johnny Lever was okay. Actions were great, "Matrix" kind of thing. Don;t go with your family to watch this movie. I hope you understand what I mean. It is a must kind of thing in F.K. International Presentations like the products made by Late Raj Kapoor. It is a watchable movie and it till now it is known by the Box Office Collections which were Fantastic in the North Side. 3.5/5 Allah Hafiz" 
" awful stomach churning fare....","The famous Feroz khan used to be noted for his modern lavish productions that pushed the boudaries of indian cinema but sadly this film despite the slick promos falls flat on several occasions. What starts off as a poorly acted and insesitive film ends up being poor. Sadly the main fault in this film lies in its story that is a poor mish mash of poor D grade bollywood storylines, it has everything thrown in... murder, revenge love, action and of course the hoards of bikini clad women who really serve no purpose at all. without the bikinis the songs as just plain forgettable. The superbike championship was a nice innovative idea that tries but fails. this film is also choppy and bitty. scene's that do not seem to flow together.songs thrown in hap hazzardly. A very poor attempt by the man who brought us classics like "App jaisa koi" in Qurbani." 
" Feroz Khan should have redone the script!","The first thing you notice about this film is that it's directed by someone who usually knows what he's doing. I don't know about the script though. It seems like something went horribly wrong along the way.Okay, here are just a few of the many flaws:1. Poor graphics 2. Poor continuity 3. Poor Dialogue 4. Wardrobe malfunction 5. Poor use of props (what was thew use for that monkey & the drag queen in this film?) 6. Poor editing 7. Poor stunts and visual effects8. Poor scriptJust to mention a few.The script (for the sake of description) deals with a young girl and her brother whose father -- is a drunken musical genius whose bad manners and judgment cost him his life one day. The young girl (who will later grow up to be played by Celina Jaitley) is in love with a young boy (who will later grow up to be played by a geekier looking Fardeen Khan) whose mother is dying of Cancer and whose father is sending him to live abroad with his aunt in Sydney, Australia because of this. Fast forward 14 years down the road, Lucky (Khan) is now a hotshot motorcycling champion and all the girls are hot on his trail. So is a mafia boss (played by Feroz Khan) who believes that Lucky is the reincarnation of his own son who died in Afghanistan during a 1981 war. Add to the mix of this, the fact that Lucky is now estranged from his father who chose to live in India following the death of his wife. On the anniversary of her death, Lucky's dad brings Jessica (Jaitley) to Sydney to meet with Lucky but to their dismay, he refuses to meet with them and already has a girlfriend whom he loves. Things go horribly awry when the Mafia boss tries to buy a piece of property called 'Angaara' from Lucky's father, to which his wish is not granted willing. Johnny Lever and Archana Puran Singh's talents are terribly wasted in the film that chopped them into unnecessary supporting cast members." 
" What a waste...","Produced, directed and edited by Feroz Khan. Surprising that he didn't write the story aswell, because Janasheen is basically a star vehicle for Mr Khan and Khan junior. The basic premise of the movie SPOILER is: rich mobster bumps off 'competitor' only later to find out he was the father of his 'adopted' son. The story is promising but has unfortunately been given little room for development. The story is just a foundation for motorbike races, fights, songs and beautiful women.The movie lasts appr. 2 1/2 hours. Subtract from this eight songs of about 6 minutes each (i.e. one song every fifteen minutes), fifteen minutes of racing and fifteen minutes of fighting. This leaves less than half of the movie for the development of the story. Which decreases even further if you subtract all of the irrelevant annoying scenes, such as beautiful women fawning over Fardeen Khan (he ain't all that) and scenes of Feroz Khan praying.Janasheen loses even more of its attraction because of the many inconsistencies. Ranging from simple things such as arriving in a silver station wagon, but leaving in a red convertible to being in a car that gets hit by a train and not even having a scratch on you. As the movie progresses illogical instances increase. Perhaps Mr Khan was running out of film?In short, Janasheen has very little to offer unless you like to see beautiful women, Feroz Khan wearing more makeup than Kelly Osbourne and RuPaul put together and motorbike races. Too bad these races aren't even that realistic. I can't remember ever seeing a race in which so many riders crashed nor have I ever seen a race in which sparks literally fly (you'll know what I mean when you see it). **/5 stars" 
" Late Feroze Khan's Last film","Feroz Khan made several great entertainers like QURBANI, JAANBAAZ but this is his poorest work and his last try too at directionHe seems to want to glorify himself and his son and hence made this excuse of a filmThe film goes around with sub plots, sudden songs, long bike chases and then a melodrama about Feroz-FardeenThe film has a weak screenplay and seems all choppyTHe romance angle is puerileThe film actually is laughable The film shifts from 1 plot to another suddenly All doesn't make sense and plus the scenes are so badly handled The last scene is a perfect e.g. of a bad scene plus Fardeen's bad actFeroz Khan makes an embarrassment of a film Music is okayFeroz Khan is repetitive, Fardeen Khan is bad Celina is awful" 
" It's Feroz Khan - all the way!","Janasheen :Ok, after KMG, I recently saw Janasheen a few days back. I personally liked it a lot! It's a brilliantly directed film. The USP of the movie is, it's style of making(love Feroz Khan's work always), music, Celina factor, and the exotic locales. Plus, the presence of Feroz Khan himself in it - so powerful is his role! He's the show stealer of Janasheen, and no one! He is electrifying!The script of the film is just plain ordinary. Nothing to write home about. That's where it suffers the most - its weak screenplay!About the performances, it's F.K., all the way! His dialogues, his appearance, his acting, body language, and the signature tune, everything is just amazing! He sets the screen on fire everytime he appears. A great come back by him after a gap of so many years! Imo, he has confirmed his "best villain award" here.Fardeen Khan sucks once again. He has yet again proved that he is the worst actor in Bollywood right now. He looks dashing, as always, but disappoints with his poor/mediocre acting. Forget about facial expressions at all. Moreover, his insipid role(as compared to his dad's) doesn't help him to shine either. Like I said before, F.K's role is so powerful that how could you expect poor Fardeen to handle the heat! Imo, he has been murdered by his father(whether it was intentional or unintentional). People should learn some sort of lesson from Rakesh Roshan here(this is for you, Mr. F.K).Celina looks like a doll. She has nothing to do in the film, but to look beautiful! It was a role in which her acting skills weren't required... so, she is all good with what she does. Her dancing movements are good! Overall, she is much better than Fardeen, at least.F.K's work, as a technician is flawless. He has directed the film beautifully, but is undone by a poor script. That's the failure of Janasheen.The music is superb. Every single track is beautiful and melodious. Great work by Anand Raj Anand.Another highlight of the film is its score. The violin tunes are just lovely.Overall, a good entertainer. Watch this one for its style, music, beautiful locales, gorgeous Celina Jaitley, and last but not the least - Feroz Khan!Rating : 6/10." 
" Cool adrenaline flick","I liked this movie.  It's a good Friday night flick as it has no serious, thought-provoking, or emotional aspects to it. The action is absolutely awesome. I am amazed at how the motorbike contest was shot.  Where such high speeds are involved, it is extremely difficult to shoot such a scene.  As ridiculous as his getup might have been, I like Feroz Khan and his being a crazy 60s-style villain.  I heard a rumor that animals in this movie were not treated right.  If they were abused, the animal trainers should go to jail, and this movie should be trashed.  Anyways, songs were nice.  This was an all-out action guy film, so don't watch it if you're not into this genre."
