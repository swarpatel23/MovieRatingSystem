" The dark page","Page 3 is one of those films Madhur Bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth. The film is compelling, but, like most of Bhandarkar's films, it is one-sided and overly pessimistic. This film is all about tabloid journalism, gossip, celebrities. The film exposes the lives of socialites, whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful, peculiar and repulsive. They party, they care for nothing but fame, they plan parties at funerals, they are craving for more money and a higher reputation, they will do anything to get due exposure in the media, to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspaper's social column known as "Page 3" with huge photographs which will be the center of people's discussions. They are attention seeking, salacious and hypocrite. The film industry is shown as sleazy, with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers. That's where our lovely heroine, a young social column reporter Madhvi Sharma, is thrown. All these people from Mumbai's elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article. Later in the film we learn that even those who are Madhvi's friends are no different from these high-society people. This was tough viewing for me, although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interesting.The film's music is average. The only passable songs are "Kitne Ajeeb" and "Huzoor-E-Ala", sung by the two melody queens Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle, respectively. Otherwise the soundtrack is bad. One song which was particularly horrendous is "Filmy Very Filmy". The film's writing is quite good. The second half is far better than the first, as it turns more matter-of-fact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse. That's where the film has to be applauded. It was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and Konkona Sen Sharma's character's disappointment was very easy to relate to. She was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive. Atul Kulkarni's part was very small but he did full justice to it. Boman Irani is solid as the newspaper's editor. Sandhya Mridul is lovable as Madhvi's sassy roommate Pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it. The film's ending is really well-done, and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings. Page 3 is a good film, it is interesting and at times moving, but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated, overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous." 
" The Write Word","The Write WordWhat you see is what you get. Not really! What Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and brilliant 'Page 3' does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose lives(read party habits) we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain. The page 3 phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic. How exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate. Bhandarkar cleverly avoids that. He is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And in doing that, he pieces together the various elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altman(although I'm not comparing Bhandarkar to Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive. Whether it is a page 3 wannabe NRI, the gate-crashers, the newly-rich, an upcoming model, a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress; all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate character-sketch, even if their parts may be miniscule. And therein lays the film's appeal. Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for Nation Today. Initially content with her job, she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moral-policing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone. Hence the movie is not only about Madhavi, but also equally about Deepak Suri(Boman Irani)- Madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery, Anjali Thapar(Soni Razdan)- a socialite suffocating from the social pollution, Abhijeet(Rehan Engineer)- a homosexual make-up artist and Madhavi's roommates Pearl(Sandhya Mridul)- the sassy airhostess and Gayatri(Tara Sharma)-an aspiring actress. It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters(and more) in one story, but full credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for penning a tight screenplay. The dialogues by Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail. Any narrative, no matter how good, can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances. Thankfully, 'Page 3' brims with actors and not stars. Konkona goes through her author-backed role with effortless ease. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part, but almost overdoes it. Atul Kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character. At times, the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possible(paedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed. Ultimately, Bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism, but he takes it a step further. He takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world. These are the same people that indulged in new-year's revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by nature's ferocity! Clever writing, skillfully incorporated songs, able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values. 'Page 3' is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema.Abhishek BandekarRating- ***** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent29th January, 2005" 
" A must see, a good movie after long time","I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director.I did not watch his other movies. They came and went.But Page-3 is nicely made. Seems real. Like Satya from RGV did.The mental sickness of the so called high society is the summary of the movie. In the midst of all the sickness, its difficult to lead a normal life which the protagonist, Konkana Sen, does. Serious movie, not to be watched with children or expecting wives. Page-3 of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in much more filth then what is reported. How this Page-3 is also a business prospect is shown in the movie. Event management firms get paid to arrange parties and make a rich but not famous people famous overnight by clicking photographs with the celebrities invited to the party.The western culture has crept into the high society of Mumabi quite deeply. The movie shows it boldly, no holds barred.Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here." 
" Too compelling yet without propaganda","The first review I saw of Page 3 said "what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say?". Should he say something so decisive.The most beautiful thing about Page 3 is it doesn't take sides. No propaganda whatsoever. This is the film that captures so many angles of an issue(I don't know what do I call as an "issue" here) and yet like any mediocre movie doesn't come up with an solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it started.The movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic. I wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead. So watch Page 3 if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times." 
" Mumbai high society exposed brilliantly!","Page 3 is most definitely a very enthralling and captivating eye-opener that very cleverly exposes the hypocrite lifestyles of Mumbai's elite. From the fake kisses to the plastered smiles, Page 3 leaves no stone unturned in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption, and scandal lurk in every dark corner in the world of glitz and glam. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where Social Darwinism is the prevailing mentality. Everyone is constantly craving for more money, more fame, and a higher reputation, driving them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from signing film contracts at a funeral to child molestation. Anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a such a wide gap between the social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of both of these classes through the eyes of the protagonist. She observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind-boggling frenzy that the socialites live in. Bollywood, business tycoons, politicians, and the underworld are all intertwined in a completely convoluted mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a nice track as is the peppy Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Terrific film with excellent character development!" 
" Succinct expose of high-society shenanigans","Yet again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a ride to the wild side. And a remarkable one it is, literally and figuratively.Mumbai hi-society -- stars and starlets, glam dolls and witch doctors, business tycoons and broker types, yep the whole stinking lot -- are in sharp focus here. In typical tabloid fashion, their worlds unfold, with every colorful story a clever sub-plot in itself.A struggling starlet dumped by the producer after getting her pregnant, the stewardess and her high-profile husband, the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, the reporters and the police captain; all shades on display and countless hues in between.Bhandarkar does a swell job of digging up the dirt on the drama kings, the dancing queens and the living dead. Atul Kulkarni packs a punch, as does Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as the ex-crime beat reporter, but she could have been dolled up a little in keeping with the job change and the party circuit.Highly focused (running time 140 min) and refreshingly different film, well worth the money." 
" Beautifully themed, directed and acted movie. A must watch.","Madhur Bhandarkar has given it all raw. But the best part is he hasn't forgotten to give the ingredients. It has come short and crisp to the viewer and it is the audience to make the choice now. Page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to it.Madhavi (Konkan Sharma) is a journalist and enjoys her work. A simple and peaceful life adores her with a caring boyfriend and a nice roommate Pearl. She covers the Page 3 (Celebrity Page) of Nation Today, where she has a very supportive editor Deepak Suri (Boman Irani.) But life takes turn for her as she hits the first bump and takes herself away from Page 3 and goes into Crime bit. Omigosh! a whole new world was waiting for her there. She is shocked, excited, stunned with the revelation. Her reaction has resulted in losing the job. At the end she is back to Page 3. Now when she meets any celebrity in a party, she knows the actual looks of each, hidden under the illusive face.The movie has a message and it is crude. The audience needs to get it in their own color. The theme and the screenplay was fantastic. There are some very good thoughts applied to prepare the audiences. Like the foreplay-club is shown before the pedophiliac exhibition, the short suspense before gay-actions in bathroom. The dialogs are strong and the actors are really good at delivering it. Charu Mohanty's 2 words speaks volumes and he is very successful in uttering those two words with such ingenuity, it leaves an impact. The set selections could have been better. The songs don't stand anywhere; but they were needed in the background. Atul Kulkarni has a small role with high-impact. There were a few flaws visible. Atul Kulkarni explaining Konkan Sharma that honesty should be tagged along with intelligence. There could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a preach. The meeting between Thapar and his daughter doesn't call for acting. That scene looks very unprofessional.Overall it is a must-watch movie with selective options before the pedophilia incident. That may spoil your mood." 
" Brave but flawed","Madhur Bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism today.Celebrities party endlessly, they like to be seen at these parties, and to get due exposure in the media. In fact the film would have us believe that this exposure MAKES celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this. IMO there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a "I need you, you need me" kind of relationship. However, the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa. Anyhow, in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column (page 3 of the newspaper) reporter Konkana Sen Sharma. She is shown as this celebrity maker, very popular at the social gatherings. She has a good friend in the gay Abhijeet and in the struggling model Rohit (Bikram Saluja). She rooms with an air-hostess  the sassy Pearl (Sandhya Mridul), and a struggling actress - Gayatri (Tara Sharma). The editor of the newspaper is Boman Irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by Atul Kulkarni. The movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level. The rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part, the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios, exploitation of power, hunger for media exposure. Into all this is layered in homosexuality, a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot, rampant drug use, pedophilia, police "encounter" deaths. In light of all this Pearl's desire to have a super rich husband, a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car, the bitching women, all seem benign ills.The film has absolutely excellent acting by Konkana Sen Sharma, Atul Kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion. But the supporting cast is more than competent (Boman Irani is very good). This is what saves the film for me. Mr. Bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash. I wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively. He berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful. We have an item number in the framework of a Bollywood theme party, the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a Western beat. I hope the next one from Madhur Bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the Hindi film stereotyped ingredients. The film is a brave (albeit flawed) effort, certainly worth a watch." 
" Amazing hard-hitting movie!","Madhur Bhandarkar goes all out to touch upon taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of the modern society. One gets the impression of the director even from his earlier movies like Satta and Chandni bar. The issues just hinted on in the latter movie are explored and exposed in totality here. The casting is amazing and one can see the judgements on each scene from many angles. Mostly, the movie leaves you wondering on lots of facts around. As you start guessing the things, you end up at most being close, but missing the mark in many a scenes. It leaves a lasting impression in the end.Actors to watch are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani & Atul Kulkarni among others. The dialogues are well written and you feel you've lived around some of these people. There are still some scenes that make you think of more depths. The songs are in the background saving time and Lata's voice in a very meaningful song "Kitne Ajeeb" leaves you feeling you're left all alone in the midst of the modern society!" 
" An excellent worth seeing movie","The movie is a real show of how unemotional and selfish the upper society has become. It has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person. No character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical Indian movies and no character is 100% bad rather all are just different. The movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions. I would recommend all to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers those hip-shaking parties of Bollywood for the Page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. But this is not all, then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed. Even she is fired from the job. Then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do Page 3 again. Not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie. I would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie. Please do not afford to miss it." 
" Great, Meaningful movie.","We have talked about our society and stupidity of society and fake world many times. But it will never reach the place where it supposed to be reached. Public only will know powder coted story instead the truth. 
This movie have diacussed that bitter truth very realistically. Such movies are very rare. 
I wish good luck for all the actors and actresses and all crew including the director of the movie." 
" Madhur Bhandarkar's take on Print Media...... a Bit Subdued......","Madhur Bhandarkar is well known for conceiving hard hitting social issues to the screen. His films are based on the bitter realities of the society or system. "Page-3" remains one of his earlier endeavors on the subject. In this film, he has exposed the world of entertainment journalism through Page-3 which is dedicated for the glossy world of celebrities and late night parties. It's the story of a young journalist, Konkana Sen Sharma in her first film, who covers stories for the page just to find the news sold is not more than glamour and celebrities and the real stories get non of the footage. Overall, the print journalism is nothing more than a business in which the news are lobbied for the sake of money and power.The story is indeed relevant, but the presentation doesn't make much of the impact for its average development. In a way the main subject doesn't come out strongly due to the camouflage of several characters and subdued character of the protagonist. The film suffers a much from the poor character development. The film has a collage of several personalities but non get a proper attention for which the film fails to hold you at places. The star power, a dynamic storytelling which appeared later in Bhandarkar's "Fashion" somewhat was missing in this one. Overall, the film raises a nice issue but the film lacks a depth and clarity to tell its story.Rating: 2 stars out of 4" 
" Glamour Versus Reality...","With stark comparison of reality and Glamour; Page 3 succeeds in delivering the message it was made for. It shows the naked faces of so called socialites who are regulars at Social parties but are seldom seen at actual work locations. With that being said, this movie does the justice to truth as it is not biased against all A-List socialites. It showcases certain characters that are true to their identity. Atul Kulkarni says about a certain character that ****** is one of those people who not show their work but actually do it.Viewers are taken into darker pits of High class society and what happens behind tall walls of Posh Farm houses. Pedophilia and child trafficking is one of the dark issues woven in the storyline. It also portrays the hold these people have on media. All in all a good movie to watch in case you believe that A-List is all full of Angels." 
" Anything goes","Crude, some times crass - to me that's the summation of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - Page 3. He has no point of view - just shallow, funny digs at stereotypes. What is the movie about?? Is it about reporting a clan of people (so called Page 3 types) who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life - that they have no time for anything else. And you are either in it or out of it. Is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and Page 3 is just a supplement; perhaps an entertainer for checking out who's who and what's what. Don't mix the two. And then there is power play - that would happen in every walk of life. So what have you told at the end of it all - nothing - just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie." 
" So far the best product of 2005. Previously, I was writing the reviews with the name taufiq awan","Assalam O ALaikum! Madhur Bhandarkar has attempted different themes in his films i.e. action social drama TRISHAKTI - directorial debut and AAN, social issue like CHANDNI BAR and political drama like SATTA. Madhur is a passionate narrator. Madhurs latest venture PAGE 3 also deals with an uncommonly sensible subject. PAGE 3 delves into the lives of the rich and famous means the upper level of the society. PAGE 3 takes the viewer to a world thats weird, where relationships and friendships are erratic and people living dual lives. You can say that the PAGE 3 of any newspaper depict and poke fun at the personalities of Page 3. The movie impact is hammer-strong as one expects it to be from a Madhur Bhandarkarss movie. Madhvi - Konkona Sen Sharmahails from Bangalore to Mumbai to start her career as a journalist and gets a work at Nation Today newspaper where the editor Deepak Suri - Boman Irani gives her the job to cover the Page 3 parties of high society. Madhvi shares a rented apartment with Pearl - Sandhya Mridul and Gayatri - Tara Sharma, a film struggler. After an incident, Madhvi give up Page 3 and starts doing crime reporting with Vinayak - Atul Kulkarni but after the shocking reality in life she comes back to the Page 3 but for the other newspaper. A PAGE 3 is a good and appraises effort because of its content and subject and also because of the honest try at conveying light communally related matters. There are some appalling exposures and a well handled scene like a businessman is exposed for child abuse, a male-model gives in to the demands of a gay make-up man and the Boman Irani fires Madhavi from her job. Madhur Bhandarkar has handled such a subject well and also the best work after CHANDNI BAR. Music by Shamir Tandon is well-designed and Cinematography by Madhu S. Rao is satisfactory and true to life dialogs by Sanjeev Dutta and Madhur Bhandarkar are excellent.Konkona Sen Sharma is good but its not an award winning performance. Sandhya Mridul and Tara Sharma shines in a major role. Boman Irani is stupendous and he will be next Paresh Rawal. Atul Kulkarni and Bikram Saluja acts honestly. The role of the cop played by Upendra Limaye registers a strong impact. And all other supporting artists were adequate.On the whole, PAGE 3 is a well-intended attempt and it has better scope at multiplexes of metros mainly. 3 out of 5. Allah Hafiz" 
" Hotch Potch.","A good director in Bollywood is a rare phenomenon and a good director who has the courage to expose the ugly alacrity is rarer. You are drawn to a movie either by the cast of the movie, the title, or by the director. In this instance, it is the director, who has made some brilliant movie's like "Satta" and bummer like "Aan", nevertheless, Bhandarkar, is someone to watch in the plethora of pubescent directors making popsicle movies. The Cast is relatively unknown except for Atul Kulakarni and Boman Irani. Konkana Sen Sharma is relatively unknown except for a little known, albeit brilliant. movie called "Mr&Mrs Iyer" directed by her mother Aparna Sen, where she was phenomenal. Does she translate well to this movie? the answer is no. The one I feel that has emerged into an actor is Sandhya Mrinul as "Pearl" the blunt and feisty room mate. That is the point of this movie-what you see is not what you get. The elite and the handsome end up as society scumbags, pedophiles and gays. The not so likable crime beat journalist ends up with the best pearls of wisdom. The movie is past paced as in "Satta" except it is not the same caliber. The movie gives a feeling that it was put together in a hurry with shallow production. This is more apparent in the beginning where the camera does't linger too long on anyone nor a meaningful dialog uttered by someone. I do not see much potential for Konkana Sen Sharma since most of the time she has blank expressions. Boman Irani is fine actor and Atul Kulkarni who is probably one of the finest actors in Hindi Cinema-the likes of late Amrish Puri, albeit, the Scipt fails both. All said and done this a good movie but not artistically exuberant, in fact it belongs on Page 3."
