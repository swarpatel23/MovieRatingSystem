" Decent Flick...","A remake of the 1998 Hollywood-hit 'Stepmom', 'We Are Family' is a decent film, but, it caters to Women mainly, lacking universal appeal. Debutant-Director Siddharth Malhotra, pays homage to it's original... but again, the emotion what 'Stepmom' offered, this film lacks in that department.'We Are Family' is about a divorced couple, played by Arjun Rampal & Kajol respectively, their 3 kids and their would-be Stepmom, played by Kareena Kapoor.'We Are Family' has it's share of wonderful moments, and to be honest, the first hour is power-packed. The problem begins in the Second Hour, the Screenplay goes for a toss. The culmination in the original, was a pure genius. Whereas, the culmination of this remake is out of emotions. It doesn't leave the impact, as per expectations. Another sore point is its soundtrack by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy. None of the songs are memorable.Production Values, as expected from Karan Johar, are first-rate. Siddharth Malhotra makes a fine debut as a filmmaker. The adapted Screenplay drags itself in the second hour. Mohanan's Cinematography is passable. Editing by Deepa Bhatia is good.In the acting department, Arjun Rampal is superb. He plays his part with control and patience. Kajol is believable, as always. Kareena Kapoor is good. All the kids, are highly efficient.On the whole, 'We Are Family' is a decent film, that has some potential working on it's advantage. Watch it if you must!" 
" Step in","We Are Family is an official remake of the famous 1998 Hollywood movie Stepmom. The story of the film is just perfect for a Hindi film because that's what Indian audiences like and can relate to. I never understood, why bother to remake a film which in itself was not particularly great, but the movie certainly lacks the verve of Stepmom and as expected it resorts to sentimentality far more often. I did not expect much from We Are Family, and it was just the way I thought it would be. The movie is a melodramatic tearjerker of its sort. It is of course much more realistic in its overall portrayal but there too it had its share of loopholes, being a tad too dated and conservative for its time.The film is of course highly predictable, but it has its touching moments from time to time despite being generally unconvincing. At first the film was really poorly developed and later on it turned into a very sentimental and emotionally unrestrained tale which is fairly enjoyable and occasionally moving but never particularly memorable. Towards the second half, the film has a very familiar Kal Ho Naa Ho feel to it, but while the latter was flavoured with great comedy and a witty touch of New York's realism, We Are Family sometimes lacks soul. In its favour it can be said that it's focused, but at the same time it's a bit too long for the story it tells, although not very long per se, where Hindi film parameters are concerned.One of the main reasons I decided to go through the film was of course the casting. Kajol leads the film with a heartfelt and natural performance which is compelling and moving. Kareena Kapoor supports really well in a restrained act, but at times I felt the story did not dig enough into her character's thoughts, dilemmas and fears before she took the decision to do what she did, and that's one of the examples of the faulty script. Arjun Rampal is convincing as the caring ex-husband. Among the kids, they're above average to okay but the cute-as-a-button Diya Sonecha was really likable, even if not particularly for her acting. She at times reminded me of the adorable little kid playing the younger daughter in Shekhar Kapur's classic Masoom. Many movies have shown films about families in times of trouble and their way of dealing with it together, whether it's Terms of Endearment, Stepmom or the Indian movies Anuraag, Kaash. We Are Family is one of them. I still wonder why it was so necessary to make it, and though it generally lacks the power to captivate and stay with you after the show has ended and is lacking in substance, it's still a well-acted and generally watchable movie despite its flaws." 
" Wow, that was painfully boring","I've seen Stepmom, and quite enjoyed that movie. So at first I never planned to watch its Indian remake. But the "Reham-o-Karam" track changed my mind, coupled with the opportunity to watch Kajol exercise her histrionic muscles.Should have kept with my first instincts. The film is just plain boring. There's not much else to say. I don't think the scenes are written very well, and the dialogue is clunky and unrealistic. Plus, one never really gets a chance to empathize with these characters because they all seem just so selfish and immature.The songs, both aurally and visually, are boring and while the performances are adequate, they never rise above the rest of the flick.I think perhaps the makers thought we'd be grateful enough having an official desi remake of the type of Hollywood movie we South Asians love: one filled with rona dhona. But come on Bollywood, don't be so lazy. Give it to us with some true desi emotion." 
" emotional","Despite what some people might say, this movie was great. It was filled with emotional moments. Every actor/actress delivered a strong performance. Even the kids were great and believable as the characters.And yea, I doubt this would happen the way it did in real life, but isn't the point of making movies is to step away from reality for a few hours? If you wanna see something sad, something real, something about love, something about trust, something about sacrifice and something about family...then this is your movie. Don't expect perfection but it comes close enough........A mother is the truest friend we have, when trials heavy and sudden, fall upon us; when adversity takes the place of prosperity; when friends who rejoice with us in our sunshine desert us; when trouble thickens around us, still will she cling to us, and endeavor by her kind precepts and counsels to dissipate the clouds of darkness, and cause peace to return to our hearts. ~Washington Irving" 
" Although it's based on Stepmom, it's unique in it's own way","I've watched Stepmom several times and sure it made my eyes water, but the story wasn't so much about a mother dying as it was a story of two women finding a common bond for the sake of good (the kids). The structure of the film flowed very well and was wrapped up in a nice little bow.This version made me cry my eyes out. It was good in that it focused on the kids and the mother helping the children transition to a life without her. The storyline was a bit disjointed in that there seemed to be some flip flopping between the mother feeling territorial.Some other notable differences in my mind are Kajol not using medicinal marijuana! Just kidding, although she doesn't, but the impact Shreya has on the kids is not depicted and Aman moving back is unfathomable to American audiences but is perhaps more realistic for Bollywood moviegoers. Also, I'm not a Julia Roberts fan, but her performance as a woman inheriting children was much more compelling than Kareena Kapoor. Maybe I'm comparing apples to oranges, I'm just saying. Lastly, the music. It didn't seem as if the music was always appropriate for the content of the scene - it was an interesting artistic choice.Overall, I enjoyed the film and absolutely LOVE Kajol. Her scenes moved me every time. And Arjun Rampal is much better to look at than Ed Harris. Sorry Ed." 
" Reviews are wrong","The negative reviews of this movie have a common theme among them - it doesn't match up to Hollywood. Well off course it doesn't and nor should it. If you want western films - go watch a Hollywood film! Thats what Hollywood is for. Bollywood is there for us Indians to identify with the characters and emotion. If Bollywood were to become like Hollywood - then whats the point! The film itself was overall fantastic. The best part about it is that it doesn't sell itself on its music. It sells itself on the story and the superb acting from all the actors. I watched stepmom after watching We Are Family and I was impressed how the bollywood version took it one step further and showed life after Kajols death...whereas in Stepmom it didn't. So who says Hollywood is better than Bollywood? The last 10 minutes were fantastic, especially where the children run up to their mother and cry. In those moments, nothing needs to be said by the actors, its completely said through their expressions.I recommend this film to any bollywood fan." 
" Watch it with your family!!","I haven't watched Stepmom, so cant compare this with the original Anyway, this itself is a very good movie you can watch with your family or your spouse. This is not a kind of full entertainment movie, of course, the movie has its light moments, but the main task is far more than brainless entertainmentSiddharth Malhotra, the debutant did a very good job as the director. Performance wise, Kareena and Kajol were equally good, both of them acted very very well Arjun Rampal was also good, he did complete justice to the character.. In fact, he is one of the very few actors in Indian film industry, who can portray this role The kids were very good, especially, the eldest girl. Some of her expressions were just WoWWW!!! The youngest girl was so cute, she was like a doll in Bumm Bumm Bole also The other child, the boy was also good, don't know why, he did not get that much role as of the other two.Music department, not so great I saw many people praising a song Hamesha & Forever, I didn't feel anything for the song In fact, the other songs like Aankhon Mein Neendein, Reham O Karam and Let's Rock were niceA good movie, on the whole.." 
" Once again a glossy, unmoving & deliberately spiced up film on the subject of terminal illness.","The latest offering from the house of Dharma Productions and Karan Johar consolidates two widely known facts about their projects post AGNEEPATH and GUMRAH which came in the early nineties. One that they now make films majorly for the overseas markets and the multiplex viewers with story-plots revolving only around the rich and upper class section of the society. And two that their films necessarily have to be all glossy, colour perfect and beautiful having no place for the harsh realities of a normal life.WE ARE FAMILY also exactly follows the same pattern, where everything happens so perfectly and nicely within a rich family to such a level that it all becomes completely uninteresting, unmoving and pointless. In short the only merit of the movie in my opinion is that this time thankfully it's an Official adaptation of Chris Columbus's STEPMOM (1998)featuring Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon.But the negatives start right here from its inception, as I really couldn't find the reason to adapt an ORIGINAL which was so English in its concept and also not entertaining enough to get inspired from. May be the makers, as usual only had the Foreign markets and multiplexes in mind to do so.Anyway, being an honest adaptation, WE ARE FAMILY starts exactly in the same manner as STEPMOM, which in reality becomes utterly confusing for the viewers. Here we have a man still frequently visiting and spending quality time with his three kids and wife even when they have been divorced from the last 3 years.Quite strange! And on top of this he is hugely interested to introduce all the kids to his loving girlfriend for no reason at all (because the main plot of terminal illness starts after this initial sequence). Now when the kids are happily living with their mom after 3 years of divorce between their parents, then why he is intruding so much in their happy home. At the most he should only visit at regular intervals to meet the kids and that's it. If he is still so much involved with the family then why not accept the mistake and come back to them right away?Moving ahead with this impact-less start, WE ARE FAMILY goes into the same old mould of Dharma Productions famous flick "KAL HO NA HO" revolving around the ages old formula of terminal illness of the hero. The only difference here is that instead of a love triangle, we have a caring mom in the film, who brings her ex-husband's girlfriend in her own home, as she wishes her to become the mom of their 3 kids after she is gone. Interesting may seem to be on the paper, but on the screen it comes out to be utterly unconvincing, slow and even boring despite of some good performances by the trio of"Pati Patni aur Woh".Debutant director Siddharth P. Malhotra, makes a typical Dharma Productions film but minus the Hit music and the much needed entertainment factor. The narration keeps on moving at a constantly slow speed and is only able to impress in the last 5 minutes alone when the story shifts to the future mode, where all the 3 kids have grown up to become 3 good looking youngsters. Moreover all the comic scenes in the film, seem to be deliberately added upon to somehow spice up the proceedings and provide few relief moments to the viewers. As a result, the end product is not able to hold your interest throughout its two hours of duration.Though equipped with two most sought after names in the Industry, Sidhharth fails to extract some energetic stuff from the duo and you simply miss the fire in their scenes together. In simple words, Yes, Kajol and Kareena are there on the screen once again, but they are not able to deliver what was being expected from them by their viewers. Individually Kajol is excellent and Kareena is impressive. But together, the script does not give them anything to excel upon. Kajol's transformation from a healthy lady to a dying patient remains one of the few good things in the movie and the talented lady once again proves that she can easily rise above a not so fine script too.Kareena displays her acting skills particularly in the second half but her character is not anything different from what she has already done before. Besides, I also couldn't understand why the director tried to portray her as a vamp in the first half. The Original flick never showed Julia Roberts in a bad light in any of its scenes right from the start and that's where the Indianised treatment of the second lady fails completely.Arjun Rampal as the confused father is fine and the three kids put up an honest show with their sincere performances. But unfortunately, the film has nothing in particular for the kids coming to the theaters with their parents. The other major letdown in the film is its uninspiring music shockingly coming from the multi-talented Shanker-Ehsaan-Loy. The soundtrack is a big disaster with the main song even having few resembling notes with "Tere Hai Zameen Tera Aasman" from THE BURNING TRAIN. Further, the Cinematography had to be eye-catching since the whole film is set in the foreign locations and also has many glossy backdrops related to the fashion world.So overall, WE ARE FAMILY falls flat in absence of anything exceptional or new to convey to its audience. But you can try it, only if you are interested in its honest performances and cast." 
" Do not see it if you want entertainment","I went to see the movie mainly because I saw few reviews saying it is a entertaining movie. But take my words 'It is not entertaining at all except one song(lets rock)'. Personally I did not liked a movie having so much of centiment through-out the movie but if you are seeing the movie with your family you may like it.First half is good but it was unbearable for me in the second half. Here is some good and bad things about it...good: 1. You should take your kids to see the movie as there are three beautiful kids in the movie who in actual best part of it. 2. Cinematography in Bollywood standard is quite good. 3. If you liked 'Kabhi Albida na Kahena' you may like it. 4. As expected Kajol, Kareena, Arjun done their job, specially Arjut Rampal lifted his acting up one level.bad: 1. Does not do what a film should do-take the viewers fully into the story. I heard few people beside me laughing in a very emotional moment. 2. Music is so so. 3. No entertainment as such. 4. Could have been better if the duration bit short." 
" we are family","this film was a very good film because it had a good story,a good actors,good theme and a very good ending if you watch it you can feel the emotions the characters were going through although it's a old film it's a film you can just watch again and again.it melt my heart away since i saw it. it wasn't that good but it should not be rated a 5 out of 10 it should be 7.5 or even an 8 out of 10. you have not added some main actors/actress in it such as: Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal and some more. main actress did very good acting the members of the did as well but the actor with cancer played a perfect role for the movie she played a women with cancer and she finds another mum to take care of her kids and she only has a few days to live it's a very touching film" 
" Boring and cliched","Such a boring movie, with unlikeable characters, cliched situations and bad dialogue. Nothing to redeem the movie at all. Performances are so average, it's like the actors sleep walked their way through the film. Certainly worth a miss." 
" An Indian Version of "Step Mom"",""We Are Family" is Karan Johar's adaptation of Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts starrer "Step mom," a family drama on the rivalry between the two female protagonists on motherhood, played by Kajol and Kareena Kapoor. Indeed the performances of both make it an enjoyable yarn with amiable performances from the three kids. Despite its glibness or a lackluster epilogue, the film is able to impart emotions and grips you most of the times.Rating: 2 stars out of 4" 
" 'Relationships thrive good, when set free; no strings attached'","I haven't watched "Stepmom", so, had the fresh angle for it. Acting of Kajol is beyond doubt, fabulous. But, for the movie; Kareena takes the cake. Loved the kids. They did all good. The story is well plotted and played. Certain scenes would no doubt, make you feel 'Emotional' and would draw you close to crying. No unnecessary hilarious scenes were injected. The thing I liked about the Direction/Screenplay was the abrupt shift from Senti/Emotional scenes to Comedy/Fun turn. These were really good. Siddharth Malhotra definitely will have lot of expectations to fulfill from his on-coming movies. A definite and superb family movie with the clear message that 'Relationships thrive good, when set free; no strings attached'. Instead of expecting and bombarding someone with vows and responsibilities/duties; let them develop on their own. Arjun Rampal acted well; calm and composed, as required. I'd be definitely watching 'Stepmom'. 10/10" 
" A Good Family Drama","Its sometimes hard for children to know and how to deal with situations that one is not able to control. A divorcée, finds out that she is suffering from terminal cervical cancer and decides to ensure that her children are looked after by the woman who her ex husband has been seeing, which leads to a conflict between the two women.A movie that carries a lot of emotions related to motherhood, starring Kajol, Kareena Kapoor, Arjun Rampal, child artists Nominath Ginsberg, Aachal Munjal and Diyya Sonecha.Kajol and Karan Johar, the producer of this movie, has roared with talent. Here, once again, she has shown why she is regarded as one of the best actresses in the Industry, even though, she looks pregnant and is pregnant. Kareena Kapoor, needed a good change from the roles the characters that she has been recently been perform and she has it in this. As the "other woman" she has done an excellent job, as has Arjun Rampal as the ex husband and father. Finally, the child artists – all have really performed well and in particular Divya Sonecha as the youngest, "Anjali" and Aachal Munjal as "Aleya," a teenager, who unable to accept what is happening around her.Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, is good as always and in particular as certain Elvis Presley type song, "Rockn Roll" genre. There's no glitz and there's no glamour in any of the songs and one will be disappointed if they are expecting any.This may be a copy of the 1998 movie "Stepmom," but the débutant director, Siddharth Malhotra, has handled the topic very well and manages to convey the emotions that are involved and especially where motherly emotions are concerned.Though a tearjerker and one will need tissues with them, this is a good family drama and is worth watching. But if one is expecting glitz and glamour, then they will be disappointed." 
" Nice film","I like the film. It was decent and emotional film. I don't know why some people found it bad and boring. Their choice but it liked it. It was emotional and nice. Posting this review after so long. After watching bad reviews decided to review it" 
" Nice and emotional film","It's very nice and an emotional film. It's not everyone cup of tea but its a nice and a sweet film thought it didn't performed well at the boxoffice but I liked the film. It's a good watch. Kajol played her role very well, from a jealous ex wife to a sweet mother who take care of her children. Her emotional scenes made me cry. Kareena and Arjun also played their part well also the children did a good job. Overall it's a nice and a simple family film. I know it's not a commercial film but still its good. I like it. Kajol should do these kinds of roles often. Loved the chemistry and hate to love relationship between Kajol and Kareena"
