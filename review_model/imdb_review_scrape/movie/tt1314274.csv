" Hulla a movie that could've been better","Hulla a typical movie made for the multiplex audience with a touch of humor with an uninspired climax. Hulla is story of a Stock Broker Agent Raj Puri played by Shushant Singh of "Legend of Bhagat Singh" fame who has moved into a new flat with his wife but gets frustrated and looses his cool due to numerous incidents thats keep happening in his apartment.This Movie starts off well and goes on pretty smoothly till about 40 Min's keeping the audience glued with some one liners but looses its way right when you cross the 40min mark. Though the movie has its bit of good acting seen with Kartika Rane, Rajat Kapoor and Vrajesh Hirjee. Its got to be Kartika Rane who plays Abha the wife of Raj Puri who actually seems pretty pleasant on-screen. Not to forget some decent acting by the watchman played by Chandrachood Karnik. Got to mention, the music is by Indian Ocean which doesn't the suit the movie theme or even the movie's pace. I guess Indian Ocean are far better on Stages. The movie has a pretty depressing second half and ruining the audience's respect for the movie with some total unusual ending which actually shows you the loopholes of the story. Jaideep Verma the director could've done a far better job than what his end product of Hulla is. I would say its definitely a watchable movie. Watch it with no expectation and you won't repent spending your precious 110 Min's." 
" A fairly good watch","I knew about the premise of the movie - about a stock broker being unable to sleep well in the night due to the building security guy's whistling through the night. I wasn't sure how one could make a 2 hour movie on that. Jaideep succeeds to an extent with the fairly simple theme. There are a few scenes which are really funny and keep the movie going on and you engaged with the proceedings. The constant confrontation of Sushant and the watchman does get a bit repetitive after a while. However, a fairly decent watch - some good performances (Vrajesh Hirjee is tolerable and actually likable for a change to give you an idea), some good music by Indian Ocean though the songs do not go with the mood of the movie, a few scenes with good laughs - not bad for a Sunday afternoon watch." 
" HULLA makes you whistle intermittently","Incidents that affect a common man in a metropolis are slowly making their way on the Hindi screen. In HULLA, it's a whistle that blows things out of proportion. Who would've thought of making a film on an uncanny subject? But fresh concepts are always welcome.Making people laugh is tough, but HULLA makes you break into a smile, at times laughter, even guffaws at vital points. The sheer novelty of the subject and its execution catches you unaware. While there's consistency in terms of execution, it's the written material that's inconsistent.After setting up things so beautifully in the first hour, you expect an encore in the second hour. But it's not engaging at all. In fact, it's a repetition of what you've watched in the first half. The story stagnates and the movie hardly moves. Clearly, the writing in this hour lacks meat." 
" No story at all","Lacks substance and very poorly directed. On the pace of it the film is supposed to deal with normal lives and the problems we face in day to day world. In the hands of a good director it could have been rather good. However, the script is too staid, and the direction plainly disastrous. It was quite an effort to sit through the entire thing. After the couple of hours, one cannot really identify with any of the characters, and it leads to a total lack of interest about the narrative and what happens to the bunch of people. Rajat Kapoor is wasted, mainly because of the poor quality of direction. The concept of a guy being disturbed by each and every noise could have been made into an interesting movie, but unfortunately this is not one. The recommendation is to avoid the same." 
" Hilarious","This is a hilarious story on a rather trivial matter. Raj Puri moves into an apartment in a society, things appear quieter than the hustle and bustle in Mumbai, which is why they chose to live further away from the city and work. However, things begin to deteriorate once he finds out about the weird neighbors and the security arrangement. The security guard has been asked to whistle throughout he night to keep potential burglars away. Things begins to take a turn for worse as Raj beings to find ways to get some peace and quite at night. Things continue to escalate and by the end he is obsessed to the point where getting back with the secretary and the rest of society is all he can think of, losing sight of his personal/professional life and what is important in life. The end is somewhat somber, but I found rest of the movie to be hilarious, I have not seen a comedy this good in a while." 
" Great Beginning but Bad Finish","Rarely one gets to see such a simple movie being made, about simple problems of life. "Hulla" is one such story. DÃ©butante director and writer Jaideep Verma tries to woo the audience with a simple story of a mumbai man, whose cannot sleep because the security man would not stop making noise. The subject is one which is sure to interest the urban people, specially in Mumbai. He does make a great beginning and you smile and laugh as well. But despite the excellent actors, the movie goes no where after the first hour. You keep on seeing the same thing again and again. The dialogs of Rajat Kapoor and Sushant Singh go from bad to worse. There could have been so much portrayed but the writer ,J.Verma surely fails the director, J.Verma. So in the end, yes the movie does give you some smiles but the final 1 hour leaves you bewildered."
