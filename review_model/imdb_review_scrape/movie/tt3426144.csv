" theme is strong but unable to create a strong impact","After a long time someone touched the hot topic of AIDS in Indian cinema. All songs in this movie are good and few can be expected to be in demand by Indian youth for next few months. The story is weak and sometimes disconnect from the main theme of the movie. The theme on which it is made is powerful it does not leave an everlasting impact on mind. In sum,this movie is one time watch and that too for "Erica Fernandes". Her voice and acting is appreciable. This movie is shot in Manali - a beautiful location in Northern India which revolves around a social work institute that is run by two individuals both having AIDS. This movies attempts to create awareness about using condoms, avoiding unprotected sex, and educate society not to discriminate AIDS patients. I should appreciate the director and producer of the movie to work on such a relevant topic."
