" Another one of the Archie - Veronica - Betty movies","The movie meanders along the same college campus with the by now stereotypical Archie (well a bespectacled Archie in this case), a rich and rather pompous Veronica (a pretty Rashmi Nigam) and the poor, lost Betty (the yucky Tanisha) in this case.Oh and there are other stereotypes, the best friend who harbors a not-so-secret crush on poor Betty. And many many more.A touch of freshness is brought about by the earnest Akshay Kapoor. As also Yash Tonk's interpretation of Goldie. Rashmi Nigam looks good but needs to improve her wardrobe. As for Tanisha, the lesser said the better. Please please Tanisha, do the audience a favor and quit acting.The movie does have a rocking score by Vishal - Shekhar. Check out the "Dupatta Beimaan" number, its hot."
