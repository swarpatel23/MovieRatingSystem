" Preity Zinta's fabulous performance...","After having a successful turn with Kya Kehna, Kundan Shah and Preity Zinta reunite for another picture that revolves entirely around her. This is a film that has it all: comedy, drama, emotions, romance and values. It is portrayed quite well all through, but it certainly wouldn't have worked if not for Preity Zinta. Don't know what it is about her. Watching her on-screen is a refreshing, encouraging experience. Her bright smile, her laughs, her screams, her real-life happiness that appears so natural on-screen, all make you believe that life is beautiful. Even when she's sad and you see tears in her expressive eyes which naturally sadden you as well, you cannot but feel optimistic. She switches sorrow with happiness and vice versa quickly yet convincingly. This is not just the beautiful character she's got, it's Preity herself. Not once has she been called a bubbly and vivacious actress. Her ability to inject these positive qualities as well as her real optimism into even the saddest of characters is unique and commendable. This is the greatness of an actor. Not every actor can do it, but Preity can.Preity plays Shalu, a girl who is a product of her father's extramarital affair, and who's been adapted by her father's wife (Rekha) after the latter's death. She is not aware of her identity and cannot understand why her mother does not show even remote affection for her while she clearly does so towards her sister Nimmi (Mahima). Yet, her love for her mother and her beloved sister is immense, and she is presented as a girl who is happy and full of life. She does not spend time crying for all ill fate, she fights for her happiness. Her character's love and ability to sacrifice her own happiness for her family could have made any other actress look cheap and pretentious, but Preity is compelling and moving.Shalu is a very simple yet extremely memorable role. She is a big prankster, at times unkind, but that's what helps her forget her sorrow. Preity integrates her boyish charm into such instances. The scene when she misleads Arjun Rampal's character on his way to the company, the scenes when she mistreats him ("Hey Driver! Ksh! Ksh!"), the scene when she feeds her mother's political rivals with a peppered pastry (by the way, the instance when they have smoke coming out of their ears is annoying and unnecessary); all these are examples of her character's mini-negative shades, but also of her unconditional love for her mother.Rekha is one of the greatest actresses, no doubt, and she is restrained and dignified here, but like the beautiful and talented Mahima Chaudhary, she suffers from an extremely underwritten role. Preity may not be as beautiful as they are, she is neither as dramatically accomplished as Rekha nor as attractive as Mahima, but it's her film all the way. She makes the best of her author-backed role, making Shalu authentic, charming and very easy to relate to by playing her with spontaneity, energy, depth and sincerity.Dil Hai Tumhaara is not a great film but it is a heartwarming family drama which was made in the most traditional way. The last few scenes become increasingly and typically emotional, but they are moving enough and effectively bring to a positive ending. You just feel its profound, unrestrained Hindi film style all over, but it works. All the songs, without exception, are melodious and beautiful. Having said that, the main and only reason this film works consists of two words: Preity Zinta." 
" An ideal picture of love for one's family","Most Indian movies are infused with family values, love, honour, trust and obligation to one's family. Very few I have found as touching and sweet as Dil Hai Tumhaara.SPOILERSThe story starts 20 years ago. We see the loving happy family of Rekha, her husband and their daughter. All is not how it seems, for Rekha's husband has another family on the sly. By chance Rekha discovers this and on the same night her husband and his 'second' wife die in a car accident. On his death bed he makes his wife promise that she will look after his other daughter Shalu.As the years pass we see the two girls grow into young women. Approximately twenty years have passed but still Rekha sees 'her' daughter Shalu (Preity Zinta) as a reminder of her husband's infidelity. And her treatment of Shalu as a result of this has left the young girl emotionally scarred. Rekha is far from the evil stepmother for she has given Shalu everything except a mother's love. Despite this Shalu loves her mother dearly. But she has turned into a rebellious young woman. Because she can do no right in her mother's eyes, why bother... The love she has lacked from her mother, her sister Nimmi (Mahima Choudhary) has made up for.The story gets shifted into second gear when young executive Dev Khanna (Arjun Rampal) shows up capturing both of the girls' hearts. His heart however belongs solely to Shalu. But when Shalu finds out her sister is madly in love with Dev she does what comes naturally to her. She puts her family first, but not before her mother in a rage reveals the truth to both girls.What is very moving about this movie is the deep love between the two sisters. They truly do not let a man come between them, for both are willing to sacrifice their love and happiness for the other. Not even knowing that they aren't really sisters changes anything. Also the love a lover is willing to sacrifice simply because the other requests this. And ofcourse the love of a mother for a child. Eventually also for a child that is not her own. But as I said in my summary 'an ideal picture of love' for this picture we will very rarely see in real life. And herein lies the strength of this movie. For once it isn't annoying to watch unrealism at work, but comforting because we would all wish to experience this unrealism. The closest most however will come to it is watching it on tv (for three hours in this case).Besides the lovely story, the acting is also very moving. Preity Zinta has taken on a pretty common role for her doing. As Shalu she is the main character and love-interest. Before long she will be able to switch to auto-pilot as we see so many American actors and actresses do. Rekha is very impressive as the mother. We see her turned into a strong independent woman after her husband's demise. We see her fighting to hold on to the past and her grudge but - thank goodness - losing in the end. But most impressive I found Mahima Choudhary. Not having watched many movies of her, I was pleasantly surprised not only by her appearance but also by her acting. Having seen her wailing and screaming in Dil Kya Kare I didn't have high hopes for her, but I am increasingly becoming her fan. Perhaps it was her character or perhaps it was the way she made her character look real, but in any event I would have to say that she was the shining light in this production.What I didn't care for much though was the love story line. It is the only thing in the movie that seemed childlike and not very realistic. How could such a casual 'relationship' between Shalu and Dev turn into such a deep love. He might have fallen for her bold character, but considering she didn't express an interest in him untill she found out who he really was, makes one wonder why she fell for him. Perhaps the story would have benefited if Arjun Rampal had been written out of it alltogether and the storyline of best friend Jimmy Shergil deeply in love with Shalu would have been expanded and given more depth. It would have been nice in this case to see that nice guys don't always finish last.****/5 stars" 
" A sweet family drama","This film is one of the most beautiful movies that I have ever seen that shows the love between a mother-daughter and two sisters so well. Its extremely cheesy, but at the same time, so incredibly real.My favourite performance was from Rekha. The role was small-ish, but she did it really well and I really understood her character. Mahima Chaudhary shocked me in this movie, I thought she would be a sidelined character with barely a role and average performance, but she did a very good job.This was the first Preity Zinta movie I ever saw, and honestly, I became a fan after seeing this. Her performance not only was excellent, but she gave out this great charm, like a presence. I really liked that about her.Jimmy Shergill was average, the role was small, and he could have been better. Arjun Rampal, was okay, but the character had no depth, and you are left questioning it. He overacts at certain points, and despite being very handsome, fails to make an impact on the audience.Overall, this movie is moving, and very emotional. The music is average. The director could have put a bit more work into it, but apart from that, it is pretty good, though dramatic. In short, it is enjoyable but cheesy." 
" very interesting movie","It starts off with a mother-stepdaughter conflict. Rekha cannot come to terms that her husband had a mistress and a daughter through her. Circumstances force Rekha to shoulder the responsibility of bringing up the daughter (Preity Zinta). Her own daughter (Mahima Chaudhry) takes to her stepsister immediately. Meanwhile, Rekha just gives her stepdaughter the cold shoulder.That fact established, Shah plunges into the romantic angle. Shalu (Preity) and Dev (Arjun Rampal) are in love with each other. Trouble is, Nimmi (Mahima) loves him, too. More, Sameer (Jimmy Shergill) loves Shalu.While you are still unravelling that one, Shah introduces the villains hatching some complex schemes. Mittal (Govind Namdeo) wants to become the mayor of Palanpur, Himachal Pradesh (where the story is based). The only way he can become one is to overthrow the current mayor Rekha.With so many sub-events to tackle, no wonder Shah loses his grip and ends the film in a hurry. That is offered thus: a woman who sees her husband's betrayal every time she sees her stepchild, has an abrupt change of heart after 22 years. No valid reason given for that change of heart. A teary speech is all it takes.All the characters, except Preity, who enjoys an author-backed role, are half-baked. Rekha, as the mayor, is never shown at work. The entire film sees her tackling only one problem --- the price of apples! Also, her house in the small town of Palanpur appears to be a mansion that has a transparent floor with water flowing underneath! Like her last film, Raj Kumar Santoshi's Lajja, Rekha's performance is top class. For the first time, she appears as a screen mother to two contemporary actresses. She looks gorgeous in the beginning of the film as a young mother. Later, she takes up the mature role of an elderly woman with dignity.Preity is superb. Her last film with Kundan Shah, Kya Kehna!, won many accolades for her performance. Her spontaneous smile lights up the screen. As the neglected child, Preity does not spend her time crying and wallowing. Due credit for this should go to Shah. Preity is presented as the bubbly, vivacious girl, with a sensitive heart.Though you wonder: given how close she is to her sister, why does she not breathe a word to her about her love life? Mahima looks great and dances well, and does justice to her role as the prim and proper girl who loves her younger sister to death. Here, Shah ought to have concentrated on her a little more and given depth to her role.Arjun Rampal catwalks into the role with his easy smile and not-so-natural acting. Thankfully, he has no emotional scenes to tackle. His character raises a lot of questions. One: why does he allow himself to be pushed into marrying Mahima without a whimper? Jimmy Shergill as Preity's childhood friend has scant screen time. His skill as a ventriloquist is questionable. His puppet seems to have a life of its own, even talking at the same time as Jimmy. Once, the puppet is shown sitting away from Jimmy, and manages to talk and move its hands.Shah doesn't seem to have paid attention to detail. While he establishes that Arjun comes to Palanpur from Delhi (at least six hours by car), there is a scene shown when Arjun gets some pastries smeared over his tie and shirt and wants to go home to change. He is shown changing his shirt at his Delhi home! A bit absurd? At one time Preity is afraid to go to Delhi alone from Palanpur and drags Arjun along. The second time, she simply runs out at night alone. Shah simply seems to have forgotten that Arjun's house is in Delhi, not Palanpur.Preity and Arjun's office in small town Palanpur is shown as a modern designer office. Strange for an office that is incurring heavy losses and is on the verge of closing down.Watch Dil Hai Tumhaara if you happen to be a Preity fan. And if you want to be treated to the rare opportunity to watch Bollywood diva Rekha." 
" Very nice.........","I went to watch the premier of this movie...i didnt expect it to be nice but i went anyway...but i was wrong ....the movie was nice......i think Preity Zinta acted well....the story is also nice......i recommend this movie to anyone who likes to watch funny movies and also family stories....:) my rating = 8/10" 
" Full of Wonderful Pure and Heartwarming Emotions","It's a great movie and regardless of what happens at the end, the beautiful emotional bonds shown through out the movie can really touch a person's heart. The sisterly love is really heartwarming. Also, the role of Jimmy Shergill as Preity Zinta's childhood friend is praiseworthy. It's beautiful to see how a guy can love a girl soooo much. He loved her till the very end and was always there for her. The thing that bothered me a lil bit was that Preity Zinta never found out that Jimmy Shergill loved him so much. But that just makes the movie a little more realistic. But poor guy, the girl he loved to death will never know that he loved her so much. His role in the movie was truly wonderful. Overall, it's a good movie that will DEFINITELY touch your heart especially if you're a romantic person." 
" Priety Zinta and Mahima Chaudry suit working with each other perfectly.","Saritaji (Rekha) is a widowed wife and lives with her stepdaughter Shalu (Priety Zinta)and her real daughter Nimmi (Mahima Chaudry).Rekhas affection for Mahima Chaudry is hate for Priety Zinta because she is a stepdaughter.Mahima Chaudry and Priety Zinta are like real sisters and Mahima Chaudry feels sorry for Priety Zinta.Shalu finds friendship and affection in Samir (Jimmy Shergill), a smalltime ventriloquist who seems to understand her better than anyone else does.When both of them fall in love with the same guy Dev Khanna (Arjan Rampal)Mahima Chaudry sacrifices her love and she starts liking Sameer and everyone is happy.This film is a great film and one of the best that was released in 2002." 
" predictable, but nice","i was really anxious to see this movie because i am a huge Arjun Rampal fan and was therefore not really interested in the plot itself but more interested in how he handled the role.  before this movie, i was also not really a Preity Zinti fan.  i was stunned on both accounts.  preity zinti is a wonderful actress and arjun's role, although nothing outstanding, was acted out well enough.i am looking forward to a role where he will be given some real dance sequences though.  the music was great, especially dil laga liya maine, and preity looks beautiful here.good effort." 
" Outdated","There are many times film flops because they are considered outdated. Dil hai Tumhara was in news cause of return of Preity Zinta and Kundan Sharma after Kya Kehna, however it flopped. The film starts off well, however the light scenes are too over the top at times while Rekha's flashback is similar to EK HI BHOOL The love triangle is well handled and some dramatic scenes are well handled, sadly there are too many subplots, the main story is forgotten in between. Another flaw is the the typical Hindi film syndrome of sacrifice, songs, romance.etcDirection by Kundan Sharma is regressive but some scenes are well handled Music is saving grace by Nadeem Shravan who were on top list those days, Be it Mohabbat Dil Ka Sukoon, O Sahiba, Dil Laga Liya all songs are fabPreity Zinta does her role with energy and zeal(a bit too much at times) but yet she is fab in emotional scenes Mahima too is good Arjun Rampal seems uncomfortable in light scenes but does well however his role is too sketchy, his emotional scenes do see him fumbling Jimmy Shergill is given a secondary character those days he was known as a romantic actor Rekha is good in her role, Govind Namdeo hams, Alok Nath is okay rest are okay" 
" Fair Enough.","I went out to see this movie out of curiosity of how two great actresses Rekha & Preity Zinta would make the movie interesting. The movie is fair,Preity Zinta looks fabulous and has acted gracefully throughout the movie. She displays the role of an ideal step-daughter who sacrifices her love for her family. The movie displays many relations and is successful in doing so. Especially the mother-daughter/ sister-sister relationship is shown very well. However the movie is very predictable and the viewer looses interest after the first half. The strengths of the movie are Rekha and Priety Zinta who have done a decent job of their assigned roles.Arjun Rampal and Jimmy Shergill have stereotypical roles. Overall a fair rating would sum it up."
