" Poor man's Chak De","Chak De India, one of my favorite films, excellently shows how King Khan transforms a pathetic team into world champions, dealing with several realistic dilemmas throughout the journey. Being tolerant enough of DDDG's story having the same goal (no pun intended) as Chak De, I do not like the fact that several scenes, dialogues, and even game strategies are blatantly copied.For example, the pre-climax speech by the coach is exactly the same. If I'm not mistaken, the order of wins and losses, including two games with previous year's champions in game #2 and the championship round (Aston/Australia), is the same. The unexpected strategy between two feuding players on the team with the more talented one passing to the less one is a xerox copy with the players running at the same angle and are at the exact same position on the field with the same number of opponents guarding each player. The list is endless.There is only one big part of the plot analogously different from Chak De, and surprise, surprise, it's lifted off of the other Bollywood sports movie of 2007--Apne. This is the bit about racism--losing out at the finals some 15 odd years ago because of racists threatening the coach. Then, the same coach reluctantly comes back to rewrite history. And of course, they have to throw in the random cheap item song "Billo" that jars with the flow of the film.The saving grace and highlight of this film is John Abraham. His performance is his best 'til date, and his enthusiasm for football shines through the screen. He has now definitely cemented his place in the industry, and people must be eagerly awaiting his future projects. It is also nice to get another chance to see the on-screen chemistry between John and Bipasha after a long time. Bipasha disappointingly doesn't give an impressive performance. Boman Irani isn't bad, but I feel this is the worst of all his performances. Arshad Warsi is cool as always.Keeping in mind that too many Bollywood films are plagiarized, I would be a hypocrite if I say I don't like dishonest work. This time I had seen the previous work beforehand, contrary to the norm, so it bugged me more. Still, the movie is well-made and a bit entertaining--mainly the second half. The first half is a drag. I wouldn't dish out the extra bucks to watch this if you have already seen Chak De India. However, if you haven't, and for some reason do not want to watch Chak De, then Goal will be an enjoyable film." 
" This GOAL doesn't hit the top corner!","Let's start with the most important question-Is this a bollywood version of GOAL (2005) starting Kuno Becker? Well, it's definitely a no. And now to the other important question-is it as gripping as its Hollywood counterpart-the answer again is no! But that doesn't mean that DHAN DANA DHAN GOAL isn't watchable. It's an average movie with some interesting sequences.Set in London (and in particular the South Asian hub Southall), the story revolves around a bankrupt football club-SOUTHALL FC which is struggling to keep itself afloat. It has no sponsors and no money and hasn't won a match in nearly two decades!!! None of its players are professionals but a bunch of full-time dads, butcher shop owner, garage owners etc. It is completely made up of expatriate Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. Adding to their woes is a greedy commentator cum businessman, played by Dilip Tahil, who wants to grab the ground of the football club to build a shopping mall and theme park. To sum it up the club is in dire straits and the only way of survival is to win their League Championship and get the prize of 3 Million Pounds!!! Really a tough ask for Southall FC.Thus the story revolves around the resurrection of the football club through a former player of its-played by Boman Irani. This time he takes the mantle of the coach after living in wilderness for 22 years!! Arshad Warsi and John Abraham are the key players of the club around which the team revolves.Bipasha plays the team's doctor.The main problem with this movie, in my opinion, is that it tries to pack a lot in those reels and that stretches it rather close to 3 hours. That wasn't required. The basic premises is right but the execution isn't. Some sequences are good-like the one that involves Boman Irani trying to convince John Abraham to play for Southall FC. The final match is another sequence that stays with you. I am not too convinced with the racism angle involving John Abraham. And especially, in today's time when an iconic club of England-Arsenal doesn't have one English player in its starting line-up!!! The picturisation is good. The locales of England are something that we bollywood fans have grown use to. But the sequence involving the home ground of Manchester United will please a lot of serious soccer fans! All the performances in the movie are good. John's soccer skills are very very fine! Arshad Warsi and Boman Irani are good too. Bipasha is just there-nothing spectacular on her part! Overall 6/10. Not Too exciting!!" 
" A Good Movie For Soccer fans","When I went to watch this movie, I knew that it was based on "soccer," which is like a national sport in this country and almost everyone, no matter what religion, caste or colour they are, support a team, whether it is in the Premiere League or even a local league. Every Saturday or Sunday and sometimes during the week days, many people go to watch their teams play.Shaan, captain of a local team, Southall United, is struggling not, only just to help the club to survive, but also help the players who are all Asians - Indians, Pakistani and Bangladeshi. One day, he is called in a meeting to be informed that the club may be demolished due to financial reasons. But he promises the owner that he will do whatever he can to make sure that this doesn't happen. Unfortunately, the owner soon passes away and it is up to Shaan to take control. He then goes in search of an ex - Southall United player, Toni Singh as he believes that he can save the club from closure. On re - building the team spirit, one of the players, in search of a physiotherapists, suggests Rumana, who is Shaan's sister. She agrees and during training session, she informs Toni that she has a good striker in mind but who is currently playing for their rival.Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal is s movie that is purely based on soccer and stars John Abraham, Bipasha Basu, Boman Irani and Dalip Tahil, Arshad Wasi, directed by Vivek Agnihotri and is written by Anurag Kashyap. John Abraham, whose films have not done really all that well this year, has for sure proved that he is talented by giving a good performance and fits the role very well. The same goes for Arshad Wasi. But Bipasha, who, while promoting the Taj Mahal for the Seven Wonders of The World, was photographed kissing the Manchester United striker, Christiano Ronaldo, and was rumoured to splitting with John Abraham, has very limited role in this movie. But another actor, who has proved his versatility, in movies such as "Lage Raho Munnabhai", "Munnabhai M.B.B.S" and "Don - The Chase Begins," Boman Irani, is again good in this movie and has proved that he can play his roles of an aggressive character very well. Vivek Agnihotri has also done a good job of the direction as has Anurag Kashyap in writing it.This is a very well researched made movie, in terms of research as well and what has made it better is that it was almost entirely filmed at London's Chelsea Football club, one of the current top teams in this country. The grounds used were those of the club. Howeve, in one scene, Manchester United Football Club can be seen and one scene is filmed inside the "museum" area where there are names, etc, of the players who were killed in the Munich air crash. The film makers were reported to have received a lot of help from Chelsea Football club and there were reports that some of the Chelsea players even kicked the ball around with some of the cast. But this movie has also shown reality and what some foreign players come across on the pitch - racism. Only recently, some players did complain that racism does exist stands where fans call some of them "names." But there are procedures that enable this to be stopped whenever possible. Also, what was correctly shown is that Indians, Pakistanis and even Bangladeshi people, born in this country do support various teams. The songs are not bad at all considering that there are not many.Since this movie has drama, tragedy and romance, it is a good movie and more so if you enjoy watching soccer." 
" A riveting sports drama from the land of Cricket","OK, first things first, India has cricket as it's unofficial national game (kabaddi, ask any1 here and u'll get a blank face). But still, soccer is ultra popular in West Bengal and small factions...So, the chances of this movie doing well were always bleak, and so it didn't do well, but this film was good....i mean GOOD...John fitted the role of a racially abused striker almost perfectly, Arshad was a little sidelined towards the end, still he played a matured role with enough maturity.The team was full of oddballs, but Boman pumped them up, okay, that ManU bit was a bit overboard, still good...U get inspired from champs, don't u...Bips was there just for bollywood style fun...the babe in the item song was uber hot...Arshad's wife was well casted and enacted, and the tale of Southhall's fan was a good twist to the same old tale...The finale was gr8...Overall, a good sports drama...and those who think what happened to John doesn't happens nowadays, wake up idiots, don't u see what the aussies did to India..." 
" stay away from this garbage","i love soccer. i don't normally watch bollywood movies other than the few good ones that get out in a year. however, because of the football angle i decided to give this movie a shot. i suffered. john and bipasha have proved beyond doubt they can't act and the idiotic and shallow characterization only makes it worse. this movie's script/dialog/screenplay/direction is so bad it makes boman and arshad look bad. now those two guys really have a flair to enliven proceedings but even they cant save the movie here. probably the only sensible thing they did was get a soccer choreorapher or whatever the guy who sets up the soccer play is called. but then that also is driven by such a clichéd script it is really not worth anything. if you like football you'd rather just switch to a champions league match to get your dose of soccer action. i rate it 1/10 for making such a bad movie about a sport i love. after this movie i puke every time i see bipasha." 
" Goal fails to inspire ...","The most awaited sports action drama of the year Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal starring John Abraham, Bipasha Basu, Arshad Warsi, Boman Irani and Naveen Andrews. Well the only thing audience waits for after getting inside the theater is "When this crap is gonna end?"Its a trend these days to make sports based movies. But the only thing related to sports in DDDG is the title and one or two goal scoring shots. Following the league of chak De India goal takes everything what chak De stood for and beats it to death. In fact goal defies all the basic norms of a sports flick. There are no nail biting finishes, no sight of inspiring football and yeah no motivational speeches. Director Vivek Agnihotri made an average debut with "chocolate", a bad but stylish adaptation of Usual Suspects. But in Dhan Dhana Dhan goal its tough to find one good scene in this whole movie.The situations are bizarre , the characters are shallow, the soundtrack is awful, the sports action is no where to be seen and the Script is a disaster. Goal is about the south hall football club which is in deep trouble. They haven't won a single match in the last 20 years they don't have any sponsors and now the club faces the fear of being thrown out and hence destroyed forever. The team captain Arshad Warsi owns a kebab corner" GLassy Junction", the team consists of few beer gulping pot bellied laggards who are more interested in blaming each other for their losses then to concentrate on the game. But for a team you need a coach." BAM comes Boman Irani" a great footballer of his time who is now a pathetic loser drinking his life to death. Sounds familiar... wait for it there is more to come. Now a team also needs a striker who by the way happens to be the dimpled cheeks John Abrahim. But Arsad Warsi and John despise each other. So the racism hits John and he is out of his Firang club and joins south hall. But a team also needs a physician... Kaboom here comes Bipasha Basu the sexy sister of our captain who by the ways is waiting for any opportunity to throw herself on our striker John.After collecting the team Vivek Agnihotri focuses on so many sub- plots of racism, patriotism, father son relationship and in the end he delivers a product which only taran adarsh can watch and appreciate "read it here". But he sets one thing right and that is right from the beginning of the movie he clearly communicates to the audience what to expect in the coming 2 hours. The opening 10 mins of the movie sets the bar so low and when the south hall club owners dies with a ridiculous heart attack( I m assuming it was that only) you cant do anything but laugh and hence when the Item Number pops up in the streets of London ... nobody is amazed. The stupid football players who flaunt their torso after hitting the goal and you wish they should never score again.A football team consists of 11 players where every individual plays a crucial role but DDDG consists of 4 players with one or two cameos from the remaining cast. To be honest till the end of the movie i was not able to count 16 players who form the team. I guess Boman Irani doesn't believe in substitute. Nobody except John looks like a player.Director knew from the beginning that this epitome of stupidity wont fetch him money on the box office that is why he tried to rake in some moolah by idiotic product placement. There are so many things which are wrong about DDDG but the major blame is on the script. The movie fails to connect with the audience on any level and that is because Vivek agnihotri never tries to do that. By the time the movie reaches the climax and start singing their anthem( which by the way made no sense coz it was not used properly) you just stop caring who wins or who loses because you will be looking for the exit doors to open.1/5" 
" Nice, But....","I am always a sucker for movies about sports, and this is no exception. Went by for a premier show, and I wasn't disappointed. Although I can't say that I'm blown away either. The producers ran into copyright issues with the title of the movie, and had to change it at the last possible moment. I would really have been drastically disappointed had this been a rip off from Santi Munez's tale in GOAL: The Dream Begins. Thankfully it wasn't. Instead it is *inspired* from another old movie named Major League featuring Charlie Sheen, the only difference, that was about baseball, and this is soccer. Add to it some Bollywood masala, and you got yourself a classic.The story is simple. There this town Southall, which is basically an Indian community, and they have their own movie theater. But they have failed to pay for their soccer grounds and the city community wants to sell it off. So the only way to save their grounds is to win the championship, something that the club hasn't managed a single time. But as it turns out, they get the team together, and somehow pulls it off. LOL, there is a interesting side plot featuring John Abraham's character and his family history, also an interesting scene in the Old Trafford dressing room. It's always nice to see the Theatre of Dreams.Bipasha Basu is excessive corny than necessary. John Abraham flaunts his biceps throughout. Arshad Warsi gives a reserved performance, Boman Irani is fantastic as ever. There's also real nice performances from Rajendranath Zutshi and Dalip Tahil. Yet, at the end of the day it fails to live up to hype. It happens to be a sad remake of yet another lesser known Hollywood movie. The music is good, although sometimes it feels blatantly unnecessary. The camera work, cinematography is good. And those soccer skills owns !! 8/10 !!!" 
" Lovely story","Loved the story and build up. Good acting by Arshad Warsi. Great depiction by Vivek Agnihotri." 
" Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal Review","The first half of the movie just opens up the story and keeps you imagining for the next half of the story and the second half of the movie is very interesting and exciting. The last 30 minutes of the movie are excellent. The music of the movie is very catchy.John Abraham is good and perfect for this role. Arshad Warsi is also present throughout the movie and has done a brilliant job here. Boman Irani in a role that demands aggression and intensity is good. Bipasha Basu looks sexy throughout, acts well although her role is limited. Dalip Tahil and the rest of the football players support ably.The movie is overall good to watch" 
" Excellent film..........","Introducing Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal is directed by Vivek Agnihotri. he movie showcases a sport loved by millions around the world, Football. So does Goal live up to the expectations? Read on..Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal StoryThe Southall United Football team led by captain Shaan Ali Khan (Arshad Warsi) is in a deep crisis. The team has no quality players, lacks sponsors and has very few supporters. The football stadium is under lease with substantial amount of dues, the Southall United team is in a do-or-die situation. They must win the Combined Counties Football League to save the ground and the club. Shaan with the help of Coach Tony Singh (Boman Irani) takes up the challenge and leads the bunch of players who lack focus and determination. Sunny Bhasin (John Abraham) has big football dreams, but his dreams crash when he is not selected by the club in spite of being the best player. Reason The color of his skin! Tony Singh convinces Sunny into joining the Southall United team. Unfortunately, Sunny and Shaan cannot stand each other. On the other hand, Shaan's sister and Southall United physiotherapist Rumana (Bipasha Basu) is in love with Sunny. Inspite of the mess that they are in, the team grows under the able guidance of the coach. Sunny is now a huge star. Enter the villain, Johny Bakshi (Dalip Tahil)who lures Sunny out of the team just before the 2 most crucial matches.The coach of the team is hiding, as he was responsible for the team's loss in the 1985 finals. The team also consists of talented but players who lack focus and determination. Goal is about achieving the impossible, from absolute no-hope to glory. The movie is a simple human drama, it celebrates human spirit and director Vivek Agnihotri has handled it exceedingly well although the script lets him down to a certain extent. Talking of the script, it has quite a few flaws, some actions defy logic and a few characters could have been better written. The execution is good and the dialogues (Anurag Kashyap, Rohit Malhotra) make an impact. The movie falters slightly mid way past the interval. There is something missing, that doesn't make you cheer the Southall United team to victory, this could go against the movie. Also the editing could have been sharper. The runtime of the movie is almost 2 hours and 45 mins. Whats that weird item number doing in the movie? It should be chopped off. The music is above average. The title track and the background score are superb. If the movie succeeds, this could well be the next Sports anthem after the Chak De India title song. The football choreography (Andy Ansah) needs a mention here, its brilliant.Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal Performances The performances are EXCELLENT.John Abraham is very good and perfect for the role of Sunny. His football scenes throughout the movie are a treat to watch. This is not a supporting role for Arshad Warsi, he is present throughout the movie and as usual he is brilliant. Boman Irani in a role that demands aggression and intensity is great. Bipasha Basu acts well although her role is limited and doesn't demand any histrionics. Overall, everyone in the movies has done a wonderful job. My opinion Overall, Goal is a brilliant movie with excellent performances. No, don't expect a Chak De India, it's in a different league altogether! At the all important Box-office, like I said earlier success of Chak De India will help Goal. I would give this movie 9/10." 
" Inspiring sports movie","This movie was so epic and hilarious and entertaining I loved the movie so much I found it very interesting and really inspiration for me and sports Songs they are really impressive and outstanding Storyline was superb screenplay was brilliant editing is mesmerizing direction is strong enough John is superb bipasha is superb arshad is superb boman is superb raj is superb khusal Punjabi is superb Background music is superb My rating is 7/10" 
" its not a goal","Goal proves to be better than Vivek Agnihotri's earlier movie Chocolate.This movie is about a Football Stadium which is leased to South Hall United Club. But cause of poor form and bad run in the league South Hall didn't had much money to pay money for renewing the lease. Now they have to win the league to win the money and renew the lease which is their only hope. So the captain of the team Arshad Warsi brings in Boman Irani as the new coach of South Hall United Club, former legendary player of the club. Boman thinks they have a good defense but the attack isn't that good so he ropes in John Abraham as the striker. John's father is a big fan South Hall Club and always wanted john to player with his community.will Jhon, Arshad and Boman will be able to win the league for the first time for South Hall Fans ????????Arshad was very good in the movie but i didn't felt same for John. Boman again proves why people loves him as an actor. Bipasha character is just to provide a love angle not much of weightage but bipasha was good in the short and sweet character.The climax is one you can say the best part of the movie. So Goal is a one time watch able movie."
