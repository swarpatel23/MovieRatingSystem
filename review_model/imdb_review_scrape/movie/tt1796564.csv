" Suicide is better than watching this....(don't deserves to be called a 'Movie')","If IMDb would have negative rating then I rate this mess -100. But I can't do that. This is the weird movie I have ever seen. The animation is really like hell. All the characters can be seen over acting. I am sure the actors were hired in maximum daily wage of Rs. 500. But they don't deserve even acting for free.Although this movie was made for children, but I recommend parents to look after their children not to watch this shitty thing. I've seen the first half after which I strike my forehead into the wall several times to punish myself because of watching this. I don't know why the people in the film industry dare to make this type of movies. Even they know that they are truly burning their money and wasting their time."
