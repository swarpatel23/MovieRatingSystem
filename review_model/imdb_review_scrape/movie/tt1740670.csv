" Very good entertainer","First i want to tell that i have never written a review for a movie. But after watching Dus Tola when i come to IMDb to rate this real good movie and found that there was not a single review for this flick i decided to write.This is a village oriented movie with a very good plot, good acting and great direction. I was totally engaged in the movie and was fully captured by the situation. The story of the movie as the title says "Dus Tola" revolves around a "har/Mangal Sutere" of Ten tolas. It starts delightfully and gradually makes it serious as the story goes on(like most of stories of this type). In the movie there are two very hilarious situations which mill make you laugh actually i think not just a laugh but will make you laugh loudly.In short this is a good family movie for good time pass and will surely provide you good entertainment." 
" Nice movie which went without notice","I got a DVD of this movie and after seeing Manoj Bajpai name as main lead, I thought to watch. This movie surprised me.The story revolves around our main lead Shankar who is goldsmith and a necklace of 10 tola (a unit of measuring jewelery weight. Shankar gives this necklace to his girlfriend and she ditches him for it and marries to another rich guy. After that what happens, it shows the win of truth over greed. The movie was very interesting and engages you for full time except the last 5 minutes.The casting is excellent and you can't think anyone else in each of their role. A must watch, who likes the cinema of Hrishikesh Da and sometime Priyadarshan." 
" Pathetic","Useless movie to watch. Don't waste time on it. One of Bollywood crap." 
" Running Strong On A Single Factor. Plot Factor. â™¦ 70%","It does give you a feeling of a Television soap, but I am mesmerized by the story previously seen in the Malayalam hit Poochakkoru Mookkuthi (1984).Taking romance to the next level by showing the hidden truth behind the relationships in villages, Dus Tola comes out as a sarcastic take on the lives of people of a village. It also gives the human nature a new definition in celluloid. Other than an abnormal casting, everything works for the movie. It does lack humor but compensates it with songs & enough melodrama. 7.0 out of 10 for a fine entertainer.The climax is a sure-shot winner.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity/Sex/Nudity: No | Vulgarity: Very Mild | Violence: Mild | Gore/Smoking: No | Alcohol: Mediocre" 
" Rip off from Malayalam movie Ponmutta itta thattan","I am yet to see the movie but from the summary of this movie it is the same as a great super hit Malayalam movie Ponmutta ita thattan.Satayn's direction is great as the success of the original shows. If it reaches 75% of the original it will be great.I will update it after seeing the movie. If you get the chance please see the original movie too,with subtitles as language will be a problem as the movie is loaded with subtle humor.See all movies of the director Satyan Anthikad and you will see how a movie can be made with acting rather than distractions and a well tailored script."
