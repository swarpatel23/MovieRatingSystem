" a cheap lift from Decalogue 6 thou shall not commit adultery","its nothing more than a cheap lift from Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue six, thou shall not commit adultery.the movie fails to inspire, and is a drag, trust me, watch the original one.its a classic.the film by shashilal nair, crated controversies, of course for wrong reasons, i was inspired to see the film as the film contains some steamy scenes of Manisha Koirala, but unfortunately , there is none....A perfect example of how bollywood can destroy even the most well made movies." 
" He is 15  well, accepted. She is 26  no way. Appearing older than 36 and heavier than 63, dunno what did the boy find so sexy about the women?","The tragedy with this movie, if the censor norms are to be followed, is that the hero of the movie (the boy) won't be able to see this movie for the next 3 years in any theatre as he is just 15 and the CBFC has rated the film " STRICTLY FOR ADULTS". And with this classification by the censors, do we assume that the other adult movies which are un-strictly rated as A can be dealt with more leniently.Anyway, about the movie, it's an ultimate test of your patience. In fact, the first 10 minutes made me wonder whether it was a silent movie until a word was finally uttered at the eleventh minute. And our ex-Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vaypayee has some tough competition here, because the dialogue delivery by the characters are much slower than his speeches.Assuming it to be an experimental cinema with an unusual theme and without any songs or the regular masala items, expectations were high, but I was sorely disappointed. A boy, who lives only with his granny in some posh apartments, has his telescope constantly focused on the windows of the opposite flat secretly watching the personal activities of a woman. He is 15  well, accepted. She is 26  no way. Appearing older than 36 and heavier than 63, dunno what did the boy find so sexy about the women? Add to it her lousy dressing sense and a boyfriend who looks like her son and comes to her home regularly for some sex sex bang bang escapades. And all this while the woman never bothers to shut the windows of her apartment.You can shut your eyes though. Not out of shame or disgust but boredom. A plot that could have been interesting if explored properly, this one is neither entertaining nor titillating. Ek Choti Si Love Story, Ek Bada Sa headache." 
" A copy that doesn't quite make it","This less-spirited Krzysztof Kieslowski's movie, "A Short Film About Love", fails in so many accounts. This is a good example for film school students on how a movie could still fail in spite of having pretensions to the contrary.The plot doesn't make any concessions to its setting and does not make any attempts to connect it to its Indian setting. Character development needs much to be desired and it drags on. Overall, the movie gives as much pleasure as a coitus interruptus. It doesn't quite start right, picks up a little steam in the middle and fizzles because the director doesn't know how to end it.Nair tries to capture the obsession and disappointment of the boy from the original film but loses it by trying to dilute it to placate the Indian viewer. Unfortunately, this film is likely to disappoint its intended target, the educated urban Indian and Indian Diaspora and will never appeal to the average Indian movie-goer who cannot relate to the treatment.
Maneesha Koirala overacts and doesn't seem to get the nuances that her character should have. Aditya Seal is satisfactory. The rest of the cast appear like props without much to do.If you have to see this movie, please stick to the original." 
" this movie is a piece of crap","This movie is so awful doesn't make sense at all such slow scenes to it through although the sexual ones were enjoyable but i just hate this movie it's just bad what world does Shashilal Nair live in first he makes a movie like one 2 ka 4 and now this bull it's just bad mostly the scenes drone on and on on what Manisha Koirala does and well that's just what the movie is about senseless scenes less dialogues just a plain bad movie about a director (Nair) to get the fun out of Manisha Koirala's body and movements just a plain bad movie on a director who's hard to understand Shashilal Nair please get a life and pay attention to what you do in your movies because clearly you just make a movie and give people the idea that just pass their 2 hours by on watching bull in the cinema" 
" Ek choti si sex story","Dude, this movie totally sucked. You should've seen the trailer which made it seem so philosophical and so touching and so heart breaking. You'd run to the nearest place this movie was screening after that to see what happened? Nothing of what you expect is found in this movie. Its completely tuned towards lust and sex rather than what the tagline says, for both the boy and the girl. You'd think that the writer at least came up with a good idea but could'nt pull it off, so deserves a little bit of credit. Wrong. This movie's director and writer has completely ripped off another western movie's plot and idea, as well as the story." 
" Great potential blown off","This underlying plot and story had great potential and it was really curious to see how the director would handle such a complicated situation and what kind of psychology would be involved or if the boy really gets the girl? Unfortunately nothing is done and none of the emotional pain or complications are ever explored. The boys is portrayed as nothing more than a voyeur who spies on the woman. His intents seem more sexual than anything else. The woman doesn't handle the kid in a rather expected complicated fashion but eventually ends up taking him in, overacting all the way. Yeah right. The media made a lot of noise about this movie's censorship but it doesn't have any real explicit sexual content. In the end, it seems that someone got a good idea but did'nt know how to proceed." 
" Disgusting..Worst film of the year","This is one of the worst Bollywood films ever made. It tells the sickening story of a 15 year old boy who loves a 26 year old women. Its weird, cos the boy is just so annoying and looks stupid. He spends long hours just spying on her with his telescope. Thats right, 50% of this movie, is the boy spying on her. Who is this film aimed at and what kind of people will enjoy this kind of trap. Its like gazing at a security camera hidden in someones room. With respect i would like to add that if the actress was beautiful and sexy, maybe the film would of had a reason to watch it. Manisha Koirala looks old, scruffy and ugly. There are little scenes of sex which is rare in Bollywood. Even these scenes were unsatisfying and turned me off. Manisha has made some of the most bizarre movies in Bollywood, Who knows why she chose this path. Some of these movies include Tum, Escape from Taliban and Market. The twist is even more disgraceful, where the boy stops looking at her and instead she starts spying on him. Rubbish acting from all actors in this movie, bad direction from Shashilal Nair. Do not watch this movie, a big waste of time." 
" Good bold plot but could be better","In Bollywood very few films were made on romance between different age groups, Few films like Dil Chahta Hai(2001),Leela explored it The film is an adaptation of Krzysztof Kieślowski's A Short Film About Love (Krótki film o miłości 1988)The film however focuses too much on erotica which could be controlled, also there are logical errors like the scene when Ranvir Shorey confronts Aditya, surprising other people in the building don't respond? I know thats trivial. However another issue with the film is showing Manisha as a 26 year old girl, with the kilos put on, the frumpy hairstyle and dressing sense she looks awful and not at all hot and looks older.Direction by Shashilal Nair is good but writing could be betterAditya Seal makes a confident debut, Manisha Koirala plays her role well, we all know she is talented but sadly due to her drinking habit and other issues in her life she lost her beauty and looks miscast Ranvir Shorey has a brief role and he is okay rest are okay" 
" Controversial, yet not really engaging.","The controversy about "Ek Chhotisi Love Story" seems to overshadow the discussion about its quality. Many people thought the sex scenes are too daring. Others believed, the relationship between a 15 year old boy and a 26 year old woman is a very evil thing. I leave everyone his/her moral, but it seems rather strange in a country where marriages with minors are still being arranged. But ... that's somehow off topic.I want to talk about the film, not morals. And sadly, there's not much good to report. The movie is lensed in a stylish low budget way. You get lots of monochrome colors and hand held camera appeal. That adds to the voyeuristic flavor since the plot revolves around Aditya (15) who is in love with a woman (26) he watches from his window. The first ten minutes have no dialogue. And no quality. The director tries to make us connect with Aditya by showing us exactly what he sees. By making us the voyeur. What works in theory, doesn't work here. Not at all. The woman didn't fascinate me. She bored me. And if that happens, one can not relate with the boy's feelings - and that's all the director wanted to achieve in the first place.But it's not all lost. The second half, when the boy finally makes contact with the woman, is an improvement. Nice to see an actress (it's actually Manisha Koirala from "Dil Se") having a couple of kilos more than your average supermodel. And her scenes with the boy are interesting and daring - in a dialogue way. A lot of the more daring stuff is hinted at or talked about. Not seen. But "ECLS" doesn't know how to continue. Actually, it doesn't even know how to end. The little momentum the film gets when the two meet gets lost quickly and it ends boring. Thus leaving the viewer with a bad overall experience.And now, what about the sex, huh? Much ado about nothing. Really, seriously. I was laughing when I saw the scenes. Not because they were bad, but because they were tame. Yes, they were rather daring for a traditional Bollywood movie, but come on! How could anyone get all angry about the movie because of those scenes? They don't even involve the boy. Not that they should - but I was truly shocked by the people who hear that someone heard that something bad was in some movie - and promptly start a riot. Why not invest that energy somewhere useful? Well, I'm digressing again. That's perhaps because "ECLS" is not really worth a lot of words. I appreciate that it's not conventional. But it's not good either. So it gets a 4/10" 
" A gentle, small film with fine performances","This film is at the center of controversy, which seems to benefit everyone, including the filmmakers, whose film is a genuine hit.  The controversy is courtesy of a couple of glimpses of a bottom that the lead actress Manisha Koirala claims to not be hers but that of a body double.  Sure, Manisha comes off a bit curvaceous in the picture, but the extra weight only adds to the drama of her character.  The main storyline appears lifted straight out of Kieslowski's "A short film about love," which was one of the films in his "Decalogue."  It's a sensitive, well-directed story of a pubescent boy (Aditya Seal) who steals a telescope and spies on the life of an older woman in the building across from his.  The boy falls in love with this single woman, who leads a rather unfulfilled life.  The boy's naive, platonic feelings clash against the weary, wrinkled persona of Manisha's character. The film does consider the love of the flesh, but in tasteful, meaningful sequences that make the audience feel an emotion deeper than the rage of the chauvinist, sex-starved provocateurs that have brought violence to this film's screenings.  Perhaps, they are rioting at the film's measured pace and lack of musical numbers, but what else could they expect from a film inspired by Kieslowki?  Just think what they will do when Bollywood starts lifting films from Godard and Tarkovsky?  That's the real danger to world peace." 
" Pathetic, typical Bollywood example of banality and shameless plagiarism","This movie is an assault to the senses and an insult to intelligence. Crappy Bollywood thieves churn out senseless copies of foreign classics, sans all their dignity, artistic value and finesse. As if murdering Hollywood movies wasn't enough, they are now gleefully mutilating avant garde European filmmakers like Kieslowski and Antonioni. The less said about the actors the better. What else can you expect from mindless copycats? Bollywood stinks! They don't even have the decency to acknowledge the originals. With the amount of money at their disposal, Bollywood guys could have made better movies. At least they are financially much better off than their Iranian, Romanian and Turkish counterparts. But it is the the utter lack of imagination and creativity that afflicts the filmmakers in this part of the world. The exceptions to this (Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen and a few other such people) have always been relegated to the periphery of the popular cinema circles of India. Truly unfortunate." 
" Mildly Engaging","The plot for this movie is lifted from "Krótki film o milosci" or A Short Film about love , a Polish film by acclaimed Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski.This was Shashilal K. Nair's debut movie , before he drifted to make movies on the assembly line of a factory much like most of Bollywood Cinema . This film was completely lifted off its Polish counterpart , as suggested by the highly imaginative name of the movie , but alas the plot and Kieslowski's subtle portrayal of the ubiquitous yet inexplicable phenomenon of "Love" , is lost in a tiresome translation to the likeness of an Indian movie poster maker's rendition of Van Gough's Irises , close but not really worth your time !" 
" Milk","There is a saying. . . don't cry over spilt milk. But apparently in India if you spill milk while crying you have to sit in it. Seem weird? Watch it for yourself. Other than that I think this movie did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of 'A Short Film About Love' a film by polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski. I think this was the first Bollywood movie I have seen without a song and dance routine. I was very impressed with the cinematography and the music, although the audio was incredibly harsh mostly do to the recorded VHS version I was watching. The story is a slow and somber one so I would not suggest watching it while on sleeping pills. . . but the main actor did a marvelous job."
