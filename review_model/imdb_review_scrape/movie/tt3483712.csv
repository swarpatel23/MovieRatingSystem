" Entertainer","I was not expecting much from this movie. May be that is why it surpassed my expectation. Their are some cons in this movie, but it has got some pretty good twists in it and will make you watch till the end. Love story part is not up to the mark. It is just a cliché. It even will make you laugh at several occasions. But that was obvious. The songs are really good. 'Tere Hoke Rahenge' is quite brilliant. The entire movie is visually very pleasing. You wont feel any lag at any point of time. This is definitely not a movie for the critics. I recommend this movie for everyone who intend to have just some fun time...!!!" 
" Cunning Script with LOOPHOLES","Nice and Entertaining Film. This time Eemran Hashmi Fans wont be disappointed. After the Average movie "GHANCHAKKAR" . Eemran Hashmi will be seen on screen after a gap of more than a year.Story Starts with Raja a Small Co artist Dupe's people with his friend Raghav(Deepak Tijori). They hit the jackpot when they dupe goon-turned- businessman Vardha Yadav (Kay Kay Menon)The cat-and-mouse game and how the duo shake them off their back makes the film interesting. Then how they plan to sell the cricket team to KK MENON. Yogi(Paresh Rawal)Prepares Raja for the big thing. Why does paresh rawal helps him? For that u need to watch the movie.The Songs can be ignored coz they come whenever they want actually spoiling the mood of the film. I think the director only needed to patch them up :P . There are several loopholes in Raja Natwarlal when it comes to logic and the conning could have certainly been more cunning and conniving. One of the film's biggest confusions is how the scene shifts between Mumbai and Cape Town. Emraan is in a business deal with Kay Kay and the next moment he meets his girlfriend who had fled to Mumbai after fighting with him! And after their adventurous ride in the rainy streets of Mumbai, they are back in the lift of a hotel in Cape Town. Lets ignore that and just sit back enjoy the movie. How they con KAY KAY and how did they loot crores of money. Total PAISA VASOOL . SURE SHOT BLOCKBUSTER" 
" Raja natwarlal in Tarantino and Soderbergh style....","Raja natwarlal is way beyond my expectations and it pleasantly surprised me. Oceans trilogy fans will love it. I liked the twist in climax but the plot is too impossible in real life. So far best con movie of 2014. Emraan hashmi did decent job with new handsome look on-screen. Paresh rawal and kay kay menon are plus point to the film, especially, kay kay menon's best acting impressed me. Deepak tijori is back after long time and best suited to his role, reminded the old days of sadak, khiladi.... I don't know the names of rest of the cast but all done good job. Story line has many twists and turns which grasps your attention. Bottom-line is, heist movie fans shouldn't miss it, give it a try, worth your time..." 
" Highly implausible yet totally entertaining","Similar in vein to films such as Snatch, Hustle and Life of Crime; this Emraan Hashmi starer will probably rank as one of his best films and is a welcome uplift after the mediocre Ek Thi Daayan. Hashmi should be applauded for taking risks with films that other much bigger names in Bollywood don't. He may not have the star power of the Khans but, with the exception of maybe Amir Khan, he has recently been willing to experiment with roles a lot more. Here he's paired with Humaima Malick in her first Indian film and she does a decent job as the girlfriend in tow; whatever India's verdict on her debut, she will still have her outstanding lead role in Shoaib Mansoor's "Bol" under her belt. Kay Kay Menon flips form psychotic to ice cool villain at the flick of the switch but, as always, he never fails to deliver and is believable as the rich and corrupt antagonist. The assassin who is hired to kill Raja (whoever the actor is) is excellent despite minimal dialogue and limited screen time. One of South cinema's biggest music directors, Yuvan Shankar Raja, turns in some modern numbers that just may linger; either way, thankfully these items numbers don't detract from the narrative too much. Just suspend disbelief because of course a lot of the twists in the plot are totally implausible but we need to remember, this is fiction with the sole purpose of entertaining the masses. Not an imperfect film but miles better than most releases Bollywood has had to offer in this genre this year." 
" A Moderate Con Flick Involving Appreciable Performances.","Raja Natwarlal is unmitigatedly acceptable. The film serves as one of the better con films compared to other bollywood projects belonging to the same genre in recent times. The story expounds the life of a small-time con artist who after confronting unexpected circumstances sets out on a mission to avenge the death of his closest ally. The first half of the film is quotidian, just like any other heist film. It is the second half where the plot actually gets intriguing and engaging. The film doesn't seem to tire its viewers as it possesses a tolerable run time of 140 minutes. Besides this, an amazingly drawn out conclusion similar to that of Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' fills you with absolute contentment.The casting department is worthy of admiration for gathering such a group of commendable performers. Emraan Hashmi, once again in a similar lead role, is rapturous. Humaima Malik's enticing good looks poised with conventional acting skills unquestionably make an impression. Paresh Rawal is brilliant while playing Emraan's mentor in the film. Kay Kay Menon, while playing the major negative role is elegant. Deepak Tijori in a short but crucial supporting role is garden-variety.Film's direction is laudable indeed. Kunal Deshmukh has definitely managed to be conspicuous especially towards the end. Screenplay by Parveez Sheikh is neat. Dialogues by Sanjay Masoom are witty. Cinematography and Editing departments have undeniably managed to make a hit. Music by Yuvan Shankar Raja is fresh and alluring. Summing everything up, the movie is decent. Neither the best nor the worst. However, it is way better than all those masala flicks which get undeserving responses from the audiences. Emraan Hashmi buffs will definitely embrace this one." 
" Good con-thriller","Con movies are rare in bollywood,good con movies are even rarer.It is a genre that is not attempted much in bollywood.The ones we had were disastrous ones like Cash,Tees Maar Khan etc.The only good ones I remember are Badmaash Company and Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl. So Raja Natwarlal comes as a pleasant surprise.It goes without saying that there are plot holes and the songs could have been avoided but the director has kept the pace of the movie interesting and the climax is well directed and something you wouldn't expect. Emraan Hashmi and Paresh Rawal are superb and look every bit convincing as the endearing con-men. Kay Kay Menon's character is caricaturish but he makes good use of it. Watch out for him in the final scene. Humaima Malick needs to look good and she does that. Mohd. Zeeshan Ayub is good in his cameo.Well I wouldn't call Raja Natwarlal the best film of the year,but it is certainly amongst the most entertaining ones.It is way better the trashy south remakes we get every week in the name of entertainment." 
" The Con is On, and its Beautiful","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsGone are the days when all you expect from an Emraan Hashmi flick are a strings of kisses followed by several passionate moments. Like many of his last films, "Raja Natwarlal" too is a clear departure from his stereotypical mold; matter of fact it's starkly different from most thrash dished out by Bollywood these days. Emraan Hashmi's avatar as a con man 'Mithilesh Kumar' will startle yet entice you at the same time. The actor has indeed evolved since his "Murder" days, and how! With a slew of potent performance in an assortment of memorable films over the last few years (barring "Ghanchakkar" and "Rush", which were let down by weak scripts), he has without doubt carved a niche as one of the country's brightest stars.In this Kunal Deshmukh helmed film, Emraan plays 'Raja', a brilliant conman who dupes common men and makes merry out of the gains. His character paints a clear picture of one happy-go-lucky man, who has a heart of gold (evident when he gives out some Rs. 6000 bucks to a street kid selling cigarettes), and makes you wonder where the movie is going. However, there is a twist in the tale; Raja's closest friend and mentor – an elder brother like figure - Raghav, played by Deepak Tijori (endearing in a bit role), is shot dead in front of him one fateful night, after a huge con in which the duo pull off more than they bargained for.The conman inside Emraan takes up a new kind of pace in order to eliminate the uber-stylish and sleek Vardha Yadav (played by Kay Kay Menon with sinister flair and malicious aplomb), seeking revenge for Raghav's death. For this, he seeks out Yogi (Paresh Rawal terrific as always), an expert at long cons. The film follows their attempt to avenge Raghav's death, with a little bit of help from a motley crew of small-time con-artists. The entire journey from India to Cape Town and back will keep you on tenterhooks, and is interspersed with spells of laughter to lighten the mood intermittently.The film's strongest point is its casting. Each of the actors is perfectly-suited to the character they're portraying. Though some performances are stronger than others, there are none that feel forced or unconvincing. Hashmi plays the street-smart conman trying to pull off a long con smoothly with equal swagger and vulnerability, and together with Paresh Rawal, creates a sizzling rapport that successfully holds the film together in instances where it wobbles slightly. These two class actors make even some of the filler scenes watchable. The screenplay is linear till the time veteran actor Paresh Rawal makes an uncanny entry from Dharamshala. His get-up and dialogue delivery will certainly make you believe that the screen brightens up every time a senior actor like him makes his presence felt. Paresh as Yogi, is the mastermind whose help Raja takes to con the big man Vardha. Kay Kay Menon is fantastic as always with his Vardha, a savage in a suit, oil- slick and lean, desperately keen on acquiring a cricket team, ready to bludgeon his way towards this. Pakistani import Humaima Malick looks hot and that is how her character 'Ziya' is meant to be. Her acting talent is realistic, and she suits the role surprisingly well. Special reference needs to be given to Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, who's mighty impressive in his small bit as a hit-man. Wish he had a meatier role in the movie. Besides Zeeshan, the other side-kicks in the film too have played their parts very well.Parveez Sheikh's script is strewn with crackling scenes that are matched in equal measure by Sanjay Masoom's witty dialogues, which infuse the narrative with verve and chutzpah. The story is packed with money, cons, romance, friendship, greed, confidence, over-confidence, kisses, chases, corrupt cops, cricket associations, twists – all of which are astutely handled by director Kunal Deshmukh. The plot travels from Mumbai to Dharamshala to Cape Town, but Deshmukh retains firm control over proceedings. He also shrewdly ensures that Emraan's signature style kissing is inherently embedded in the script. The serial-kisser can give Hollywood a cutthroat competition in that department, hands down. Cinematographer, Raaj A. Chakravati's work is also worth a mention."Raja Natwarlal" wins you over by the sassy swagger of its tricks, its conmen, and scenes like the climax at the 'HDMC Bank', all with its tongue lodged firmly in cheek. The film begins with a small con game and towards the climax, ends with a huge, elaborately planned con, making the audience applaud with our hero, Emraan Hashmi. We can safely say that this time, the con is well and truly on." 
" This Con Man Will MakeYour Day","Raja Natwarlal is third film of director and actor's pair.This movie is about a con man Raja(Emaraan Hashmi) who wants to take revenge from Varda Yadav(Kay Kay Menon) with the help of Yogi(Paresh Rawal).Movie starts with Raja(Emraan Hashmi) who con people on the station bridge with his brother Raghav(Deepak Tijori).Raja planned to rob one man with rupees 80 lacks.Raghav told him to stop being insatiable.But Raja forced him to do this.After robbery they came to know that those money belonged to Varda Yadav(Kay Kay Menon).So,he told his men to kill them but they only found Raghav and killed him.When Raja came to know this and he decided to take revenge with Varda Yadav.He went to Yogi(Paresh Rawal) for the help.Yogi took test of Raja to check whether he is ready for the big con or not.Raja passed and so they put a trap for Varda Yadav.Will they succeed?Positive : + Paresh Rawal+ Music+ ClimaxNegative : - Humaima MalikScreenplayCinematographyOverall : If you're a big fan of Emraan Hashmi then surely you'll lovethis movie.A good choice for this weekend." 
" Very entertaining, with lots of twists n turns. Apart from the main plot being copied from The Sting, this is a complete different heist thriller.","I saw this on some TV channel. Yeah i know that its a copy of The Sting. Having enjoyed The Sting i thot lets check how much Raja Natwarlal is copied frm The Sting. Believe me apart from the main plot (a young con man seeking revenge for his murdered partner teams up with a master of the big con to win a fortune from a criminal who murdered his partner), there is nothing copied from The Sting. Very different heist, different twists, different methods of conning. Some may compare it to Oceans trilogy or Focus or other heist films. But Raja Natwarlal is a very exciting and very entertaining film. Lots of twists n turns to keep guessing. The acting was simply perfect. Hashma and Rawal gave lovely performances. The villain (K.K. Menon) was convincing in being nasty, smileless n a crooked fella. The twist and turns is great and the film is almost perfect. The only (two) bad things bout this movie is the title of the film n Hashmi's denim shirt." 
" Twist & Turns with Talented & Experienced Star Cast","I watched the trailer and knew that the movie will have something new to offer. The main Lead "Emraan Hashmi" has given another good performance after 'shanghai' beyond his portrayed and perceived image by Mahesh Bhatt's movie. The name itself is catchy and makes audience curious to watch the movie. The plot has its ups and down, Deepak Tojori was seen on the big screen after a long time and then you get to see KK Menon and Paresh Rawal. The Actress 'Humaima' fits the need of the character and do justice to her debut film. This is one movie with no misfits. Everything gels well in the script from starting playful, fun times to the feeling of revenge, simple strategy and execution. The movie also leaves a scope of a sequel , that would be tricky business. The sequel, if comes would be expected to deliver high hopes of the audience. Appreciation for all the directors, as the simple concept was taken to extra-ordinary level. Kudos !" 
" Raja Natwarlal","Raja Natwarlal - the name didn't ride on any big hopes prior to its release. It marks the fourth collaboration of director Kunal Deshmukh and Emraan Hashmi and that too outside the Vishesh Films camp. A con- caper at its heart, Natwarlal entwines all the possible elements of a typical Hashmi potboiler - drama, revenge, twists and the customary lip locks.The Plot. A street-smart thug named Raja(Hashmi) inadvertently crosses paths with a deadly Cape Town-based don, Vardha(Kay Kay Menon, deliciously menacing)when he, along with mentor Raghav(Deepak Tijori), steal away a hefty sum from his men. Raghav is killed by Vardha's men and Raja swears revenge.He takes the help of a rather cynical ex-con guru Yogi(Paresh Rawal)in devising a royal scam to rob the don off all his ill-acquired wealth. With an agenda that they would auction a fake cricket team to Vardha as the sport is ostensibly his only weakness, the stage is all set for the battle of wits!Reportedly inspired from the 1973 Hollywood flick, Sting, Raja Natwarlal manages to keep you hooked with all its twists and turns. With an undercurrent of humor and crisply written dialogues, the narrative springs out good sequences , particularly when Raja and his motley of con-men stage a fake meeting of Vardha with the cricket board Chairman with a pest-control-in-progress tag outside the room. What doesn't work here is the love track between Raja and his girlfriend, Ziya(Humaima Mallik) and the monotonously choreographed dance-bar numbers. And every time, the action ticks off , it is soon ruptured by stupidly placed songs .Even the beautiful picturizations amidst the scenic locales of Cape Town and the music by new-find Yuvan Shankar seldom do the damage control. It would also require a suspension of disbelief for the discerning viewer to see how an overtly incredulous tycoon gets tricked in the name of a fake cricket league.With a mediocre intensity this time, Emraan Hashmi pulls off the act efficiently. He imbues Raja with a steely resolve and manages to give an emotional depth to the character. The movie redeems much of its lost strength from accomplished stars like Paresh Rawal who is superb as the satirical con-coach and mouths hilarious two-liners and Kay Kay whose performance is near immaculate. It was rather disappointing to see the talented Mohd Zeesan Ayub(Raanjhana) wasted in a sliver of a role as the mute hit-man .Humaima, who proved her potential in Pakistani films, hardly impresses here and is reduced to an average glam queen.Sumeet Nijhawan(Maazii,Diskhiyaoon) is adequate as the wicked policeman.Raja..isn't a great film, but at the same time doesn't disappoint you with its mischievous shades." 
" Really Like The Ending Twist!!","Emraan Hashmi came back to commercial 'MASAALA' film after almost one and half year, And yes he's back with his charming on screen presence.Now come to the REVIEW...Yes this is a nice film with a new kind of story line (At least it's not a remake of south movie] Emraan did a great job as usual (Actually he really improved his acting skills). Deepak Tijori was in a small but effective role. Not many scenes given to Humaima to show her talent but yeah she is good. But apart from Emraan I did really like Paresh Rawal's character he was extremely good as a con master.The film was not as great as I expected. The Jodi of Paresh & Emraan as 'Guru & Chela' was worth a watch. Story was not that great a little bit less engaging some times (1st half was really not that engaging but the 2nd half where it catches the suspense) The climax was the highlight of the film. The ending twist was superb.Overall It's a nice film with enjoyable moments (Songs were really nice especially 'Tere Hoke Rehenge' 'Namak Paare' 'Kabhi Ruhani Kabhi Rumani'). And if you are a Emraan Hashmi fan then you must watch it.You will not be disappointed at all." 
" Could have been so much better. Still appreciate the effort!","RAJA NATWARLAL: "A movie that had good potential fails to make a solid impression!" [2.5/5]Emraan Hashmi returns to the BIG screen after last year's GHANCHAKKAR. Before I begin reviewing I must say that he likes signing in for the movies that are promising and has potential to deliver something new and different.This one too is & it's worth appreciating. But the problem lies in how the movie is handled. Anyways, the story is about Raja, who is a small time conman who gets his partner killed in an attempt to break into the big league. Then to avenge this death he seeks out a bigger retired conman to help him. Together they hatch a plan to steal the rich guy's money so that Raja can marry his bar dancer sweetheart and avenge the death in one swoop.The story at its core is OK and the little clever touches of con games are funny and entertaining at times. However, neither the characters nor their motivations are strong enough for us to root for either the conman or the rich cricket crazy dude getting conned. You are indifferent to their fates and that is totally dangerous in a movie which depends on your liking the con guy to make the story work. To make matters worse there is the romantic angle which just doesn't work and which pulls the narrative down in its best parts with some soppy songs and unnecessary kisses.The star cast is great- Emraan as Raja, Paresh Rawal as the master con and Kay Kay Menon as the rich guy are all great actors and their chemistry makes the movie extremely watchable in parts. They manage to create a good feeling of tension in a few crucial scenes. New actress , Pakistani import Humaima Malik is too thin to register on screen and the only way you can tell she is there is when there is some spangly costume floating about on the screen. I was nice to see Deepak Tijori again on screen looking older and better without his old funny hairstyle.Raja Natwarlal could have been infinitely smarter, funnier and way more taut given the story it was working with and the star cast. Instead what we get is patchy pieces of good action, silly songs and a storytelling session as we are tucked into bed(meant for some excessive runtime) Anyhow, watchable it is. [2.5/5]" 
" Decent con film","Kunal Deshmukh after Jannat Series and Tum Mile which was a dud returns with Raja Natwarlal, In fact half of the cast from Jannat 2 return in this film. The film starts with Emraan a con artist who cons people and then finally in a twist he looses his friend and mentor which makes him seek revenge The film has good twists, though some deja vu moments, even the romance is typical Emraan Hashmi film style with our heroine playing a bar dancer. The film has too many songs too like at the start we have 3-4 songs in quick succession. Yet the film manages to entertain and grips you at many places However illogical it gets at times, yet the manner in which they con Kaykay is well handled, The finale too is goodDirection is good Music is decent, Tere Hoke Rahenge is a good song, rest are all good but the songs are too many and at times wrongly placed.Emraan Hashmi has played streetsmart characters earlier, but there is lot of depth in his performance which shows his growth and he suits the part superbly Paresh Rawal gives the film an edge and does a great job Kaykay Menon is superb in a role apparently modelled on Sahara Chief Subrata Roy, he is fabulous as always Deepak Tijori has a good cameo and does a great job, seen after a long time he gains good sympathy for his short role Sumeet Nijawan has a solid, menacing presence as a bad cop and does a good job, while Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub is wasted terribly Humaima Malick is however not too impressive as the lead heroine though it can be overlooked as it's her maiden attempt in Bollywood" 
" A Better Con Movie Than Shah Rulh Khans Happy New Year","Basic story...A small-time con man assembles a team to help him avenge the death of his partner-in-crime at the hands of a powerful gangster.This is the same base story that was used in happy New Year that was released in the same year. I am surprised I had not heard of this movie considering it had Paresh Rawal and Kay Kay Menon In there.
I am not a huge fan of Emraan Hashmi but this came up on Netflix and since there wasn't anything else to watch I thought I'd watch it. Went in with having no hopes but boy was it engaging.
The songs are not needed. Cut those out you've got a solid 2 hr film. Recommend watch." 
" A good con film","review of raja natwarlal I have always liked Kunal Deshmukh as an director.His works include jannat,jannat 2,tum mile and now raja natwarlal.There has,nt been a lot of good con films in the past.Raja natwarlal begins on a slow note with Emraan Hashmi and Deepak Tijori conning a few people.The first half of the film is enjoyable though lacks a sense of humour.The second half introduces Paresh Rawal as con man too.They plan a con on a business tycoon,Vardha Yadav who killed Deepak Tijori.The performances are great.Emraan Hashmi stands tall as usual.Paresh Rawal is great in his part.The rest of the cast play their parts well.The screeplay was good although a few loopholes here and there.The climax is one of the best climaxes i have ever seen.After all said,A good con film after a long time.REcommended"
