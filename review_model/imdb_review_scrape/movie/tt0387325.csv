" Decent movie with a great cast and good humour throughout","I really disagree with the ratings so far. I'v seen this movie a few times its an enjoyable affair... The movie has good humour,story and cast..lets not forget its got one of the comedy kings in Paresh Rawal... I would recommend this movie even though it is long but its not as bad as the ratings suggest.. In this day and age when we see numerous slapstick comedies released for box office success well its better than that for sure.The movie revolves around a struggling writer in need of a good love story who tries to get a couple together who are children of two best friends but the children are very different to each other and enemies at start. Yhe movie does get serious and has a good storyline... the best humour is from the one and only paresh rawal but nothing taken away from the other cast, they were good too." 
" Typical "formula film"","There was nothing different about this movie at all.  It was a typical Bollywood "formula film."  Belonging to the comedy genre, the humor was, for the most part, pretty stupid.  One or two of the songs were okay.  This movie was too long--almost 4 hours.  It's tough to sit through a movie with poor-quality comedy for so long."
