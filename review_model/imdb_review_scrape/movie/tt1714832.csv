" Do Dooni Chaar - I can relate to it Yaar !","I am a middle class salaried person, having two children (one son and one daughter), a wife having the typical middle-class mindset and a moderately furnished house. Till three years back, I was riding a scooter only (still I ride the scooter only for most of the time). In 2007, upon shifting from Rawatbhata (Rajasthan) to Delhi, I bought a car (Maruti 800). So when I saw the promos of this movie, I at once decided to watch it because I felt I would relate to it. And my prediction came true.Do Dooni Chaar (two twoja four) is the story of a typical middle class family living in a metro like Delhi whose head is not a permanent employee in a govt. office or a reputed company. He is a mathematics teacher (that's why the name of the movie is a mathematical one) in a private college, getting moderate salary and he supplements it by doing tuitions. He rides an old Bajaj scooter and lives with his family (consisting of his wife, son and daughter) in a moderate single bedroom flat. Like almost all the middle class Indian families, they have to spend more than their capacity for the sake of pomposity, relationships and social prestige. Like several middle class children living in metro cities, their children also like to make girlfriend / boyfriend, visit Mc Donald for eating and make quick money for out of pocket expenses which their parents are not able to provide them. Like most of Indian middle class parents, they also want their children to study in reputed English medium educational institutions and become something big in their lives. For that sake, they control their own expenses but ensure that the children's future is not adversely affected for want of money.However this Do Dooni Chaar family has a family head with a difference from likewise family heads. Though like a typical middle class housewife, the wife wants her husband to earn some extra bucks even by compromising his conscience, the head of the family has his own morals to cater to. They pay bribes to the corrupt Indian establishment under compulsion (like most middle class Indians have to) but they do not do anything likewise themselves. The first reason is conscience. However the bigger reason is fear of doing something bad (or unlawful, to be exact). However when they have to suffer humiliation upon using the neighbour's car upon the special occasion of attending a marriage in close relation, the self-respect of the head of the family (the Duggal family) gets hurt to that much extent that he decides to buy his own car. Now what happens in making arrangement for down payment of the car which is not a small amount for a hand-to-mouth family in the capital city and how several allied things come to the fore, form the post interval part of the story.Do Dooni Chaar is an excellent and very well made movie. While watching the movie I was feeling as I were Rishi Kapoor, my wife were Neetu Singh and my children were their children. Everything shown and every character shown (especially the family members) are so realistic that even for a moment you do not feel that you are watching a fictional story of an imaginary family. And it is this realistic touch of simple middle class Indian life and simple middle class Indian characters that makes this movie a winner all the way. Whether it's Rishi's prohibiting his daughter from doing a call centre job or it's his blaming himself for his son's spoilage or it's Neetu's complaining to her husband for making her leave her job or it's her fuming over the monthly income and expenditure budget of the family; everything is natural. It's the typical Indian middle class family which barely manages to live a reasonable life but still dreams big. And still owning a car and owning a house are the biggest dreams of the typical Indian middle class people.The movie also effectively underscores the nobility of the noble profession of teaching alongwith the fact that teachers (especially in the non-govt. sector schools) are the one of the least paid salaried people in India which is a major factor behind the poor educational standards in our country.Rishi-Neetu are awesome in their performances with their off screen chemistry coming alive on the screen. But the actors (Archit Krishna and Aditi Vasudev who is the anchor also) playing their children have overtaken them by their brilliant performance. All others (including Akhilendra Mishra as their neighbour and the actress playing Phupho to be specially mentioned) have also done exceedingly well.Music is not great except the marriage song - Banni Hamaari Chaand Se Pyaari. The art director has done a splendid job by capturing the life in Delhi with utmost reality. In fact the whole Do Dooni Chaar team deserves a big hand alongwith the writer-director Habib Faisal. The only thing which may not appeal to the non-Delhites and non-Punjabis is the overdoz of Punjabi language. But that's not a big issue.This movie reminiscing the Hrishikesh Mukherjee-Basu Chatterjee movies of the seventies and early eighties, is just like a gust of fresh and cool breeze in the cinematic environment suffocated by so-called NRI movies. I recommend this light-mood family drama wholeheartedly and unconditionally to all the movie buffs." 
" Two times 3Â½","Do Dooni Char is one small episode portraying a middle-class Delhi family struggling through their financial limitations. It is a humorous and enjoyable feature though it is more impressive for its authenticity and realistic feel rather than the story itself. That's where the film scores. The spirit of Delhi and its middle-class families is wonderfully captured. The sets, the costumes and the props are all very simple and thus create an enchanting sense of everyday realism which is very missing in Hindi films. The writing itself is not particularly great, but the film has its moments and it actually deals with problems not usually dealt with in Indian movies, such as the modest salaries professional teachers get paid for their efforts and how this affects their image. This specific issue is conveyed through the main element of the narrative, namely the lack of a car in math teacher Santosh Duggal's family, which also includes his wife and two children. He is forced to use a scooter and at some point this starts saddening him and those who surround him. Quite a lovely way of conveying a concept, and it is generally well done, but at times the movie is way too messy and hard to follow. The film has one more plus and it is the casting, particularly of Rishi Kapoor, who delivers a moving and convincing performance with natural ease. Neetu Singh Kapoor is very good, especially considering the fact that she had not acted for decades. The kids do well and Aditi Vasudev is also good in narrating the film. Do Dooni Chaar is one nice film which is not flawless but is colourful enough to entertain and enlighten." 
" Small budget movie but a great and excellent concept.","Do Dooni Char is one small episode portraying a middle-class Delhi family struggling through their financial limitations. It is a humorous and enjoyable movie throughout but is more impressive for its authenticity and realistic feel more than the story itself. The story is where this exceptionally good film scores. The spirit of Delhi and its middle-class families ha been wonderfully captured. The casts,sets and the costumes are all very simple and thus create an enchanting sense of everyday realism which is very missing in Hindi films. The film has its moments and it actually deals with problems not usually dealt with in Indian movies, such as the modest salaries professional teachers get paid for their efforts and how this affects their life.The pairing of Neetu and Rishi Kapoor adds to the advantage of the movie and makes it much more better.Its great to see both of them on screen together after decades. The story deals with the life of Santosh Duggal,played by Rishi Kapoor. He is forced to use a scooter and at some point this starts saddening him and his family.The movie is also about the dream of the family to own a car.A lovely way of conveying a concept, and it is generally well done.The biggest plus point is the casting, particularly of Rishi Kapoor, who delivers an excellent performance. Neetu Singh is very good, especially considering the fact that she had not acted for decades. Do Dooni Chaar is a great film that relates to the life of many Indian middle class families and reminds of our childhood days.A real entertainer for me." 
" Great work!!","Thank God, I'm watching lot of good films nowadays!! It is good for mental health!! Do Dooni Chaar is a movie that is excellent in all aspects. Be it the casting, the dialogues, the direction, or anything. Just one word, excellent!! There have been crap movies in the past, there have been movies in which the director attempted to do something good ,but ended up as a failure. I suggest such people watch this movie. This is a textbook for people who want to make simple films with great intentions. Of course, Do Dooni Chaar hits the right target, and that is the success of the director. No wonder, after watching this movie Sachin Tendulkar wanted to act in this director's movie. And one more thing, this movie is produced by Arindam Chaudhury, the famous economist and the founder of IIPM. He has done a good thing to produce such a great movie. So, what's the movie about?? It revolves around the life of Duggal family, consisting of a dad, mom and two children. Real life couple Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh have come up together on screen after so many years, ant the chemistry is extra ordinary. The girl and the boy who acted as their children are equally good. The story is completely natural, simple and refreshing. The movies like Do Dooni Chaar should be made, this is doubtlessly a real gem in Indian cinema, one of the best movies of the recent times!! Habib Faizal, you rock!!" 
" A strong script and Rishi Kapoor make the firm worth it!","I don't remember when was the last time i saw a movie with such a simple but strong storyline. I won't term this movie as a comedy but it definitely had humor in it. The plot of the movie is so simple that any middle class Indian would be able to relate to it, the dream of Duggal Family to become the owner of a four wheeler from a two wheeler(as you can already make out from the title). Rishi Kapoor essays the role of a low earning maths teacher which he played to perfection, hardworking and still hated by his students(reminded me of some of my school teachers), Neetu Kapoor was the housewife who in parts reminded me of my mother, hardworking and tired but still non complaining. Add to that two kids who always have complaints from there parents as they are trying to become a part of the high society friend circle. The house and the society in which the Duggal's stayed kept me guessing through out the movie as to which part of Delhi was it as it could have been any middle class Punjabi dominated area of Delhi. Add to this a lot of complicated situations to the life of the Duggal's in their effort of buying a car and you get a complete family package. It is a movie without the usual glam sham which you expect from a Hindi movie but considering the story and the excellent acting of Rishi Kapoor, I don't think there was a need for any. See this if you like simple family movies without any melodramas." 
" The real taste of Delhi.. funny and quite authentic","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The storyline is funny, the acting is good and the best part is the movie is not too out there. My biggest pet peeve with most bollywood movies is that everything is too loud and exaggerated.. This thankfully isn't one of those movies. The story is about a middle-class teacher and nothing is out of the ordinary. No glamorous daughter who hangs out in pubs all night, no over-dramatic wife, no weird spoilt filmy children. As a matter of fact, the attention to detail with which the director has shown a middle class family is just too darn amazing.. There are so many little things you can notice about your average everyday middle-class family that not only make you wonder the amount of effort that was put into researching, but which also make the movie genuinely funny and likable! Like I particularly liked the scene where Rishi kapoor adjusts the wires of his nightlamp to make it work (presumably as it was without a plug), or how neetu singh is washing the verandah in slippers and socks.. such little things! The acting is also very good.. rishi kapoor makes it look effortless.. neetu singh does a convincing role of your everyday housewife.. the kids even though in college thankfully aren't also prancing around singing songs in college either... If you need to see the real Delhi this is the movie you should watch.. really good clean fun!" 
" captures middle class India caught in consumerism","Was flipping through channels on Sunday night after having nothing better to do and saw this wonderful movie do dooni char. Captured essence of middle class life so succinctly and reminded me of my childhood. Best was ending of movie when narrator (daughter of protagonist) claims that consumerism is not bad. In family's desire to buy a car they could rediscover their dad, started taking pride in their lives and his brother and father came close to each other. Their effort to win lucky draw by opening thousand boxes of detergent reminded me of how dutifully mom was collecting each edition of local newspaper when they had a maruti draw or how I used to try KBC phone religiously in college. Typical middle class dreams and desire to fulfill them. How one has societal pressures of showing one in good position in marriage at one's relatives, how neighbors fight and learn to live together and how old teachers always live in heart of students." 
" Each generation should watch.","The movie basically depicts the hard times came for a school teacher as the teacher cannot keep their family happy with the salary they get.Life can be tough for a man who teaches in school and also giving tutions,make the future of many student but cant make their own children future due to their less salary.The teachers, and their issue with their self-worth in the face of growing inflation and demands of their family. The middle-class school teacher who works overtime to support his income and to send his children to good schools, ends up in a moral dilemma, when it comes to fulfilling the needs of his ever unsatisfied teenage children. The movie is a perfect watch for all generation and teaches everyone a lesson.All the mummy's and daddy's who haven't watch the movie should buy the DVD and watch it with your children,you will love it,and those children who think their parents are not fulfilling their wishes will understand that their parents are actually struggling." 
" Entertaining Middle Class Movie. Makes one proud of a honorable life lived.","Excellent middle class movie. Average teacher lives a honorable life with a wife and 2 smart kids. Does his best in his job every day and helps his students become brilliant engineers and doctors. But teachers job doesn't pay much so faces social status dilemmas in day to day life. Kids and wife love him and have great respect toward him despise their regret with the fact that he cannot bring them luxuries of life that their friends have.Sensible comedy. Decent action. Relates to day to day life in India in a very proud way.The movie is about how they overcome day to day events/disappointments/regrets as a result of their social interaction. Rishi kapoor chose an excellent story and role. I associate myself personally with Rishi kapoor and hope to be as strong to resist the life's temptations and live a honorable life. If you cant buy a car, it hurts you that day when somebody points out that fact but you forget it sooner than you think. if you surrender to that temptation and buy a car with undeserved money, you will be less confident and feel the shame for the rest of your life. Its a trade off between 'BigGainNow+LifeLongRegret' vs 'UnhappinesNow+LifeLongPride+RoleModelForYourKids'.I will not waste any opportunity to show this movie to my family. Should be in my DVD collection." 
" A rare movie showing real middle class picture","Long after "Khosla ka ghosla" has a good movie with middle class background has come up. I would say the movie is far better than anyone can expect of Habib Faisal.The movie starts with a very simple layout and continues the simplicity of middle class throughout. Definitely the characters are perfect suited for their roles and the storyline. Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh came out very realistic. This movie has changed the picture of Rishi Kapoor-the rich dad to Rishi Kapoor-a middle class man.The movie portrays a normal family with mummy like housewife saving a rupee wherever possible; father still using age-old scooter; decent and trying to be a boy daughter; and a ambitious son doing just good with his demanding girlfriend. The best part is there were no Golmaal-type events or songs to make the viewer happy or sad and everything comes out very naturally except for 1-2 scenes. I assure you the climax is not very expected type but you would appreciate the originality and attention to detail.Basically, the movie contains a great deal of drama, comedy, sentiments and definitely suspense as to what happens of the CAR. If you liked "Khosla ka ghosla-quest for middle class house" this "quest for a car" is your type. No food for thought-just entertainment." 
" Pure Family Entertainer.","I enjoyed seeing the couple together after many years :)
They still rock.
Movie is a real family entertainer.. Sit back and enjoy" 
" A good watch","I watched Do Dooni Chaar on TV a few days ago. It was on my list but I could not find it on YouTube surprisingly even though it is not a latest release.The plot is so realistically enacted. The typical lower middle class Delhi family is so believable. Rishi Kapoor is superb but hats off really to Neetu Singh who transforms effortlessly to a lower middle class typical Delhi housewife. She is just so believable in her role, far removed from the super sophisticated, upper class Kapoor wife that she is in real life. The son and daughter are also good as is the rest of the cast.The sets and cinematography are wonderful. The dialogues are real. This is really a nice watch especially for those who can connect with the Delhi set up." 
" A simple movie with simple hopes and dreams","It is kind of movie that drives you with their character.When you are watching this movie you will feel that you are one of the character.It shows the reality of a middle class family with limited by income,but unlimited hopes and dreams.I watched this movie a years ago,but still I can feel that happiness which I felt at the end of the movie.This movie consists of a father,who is a school teacher(In subcontinent which is a less paid job),so to run his family he has do some coaching classes.But still he cant manage his family.A daughter,who is very ambitious,she wanted to buy a car by working in a call center but her father did not allow.A son,who wants to earn money by hook or crook.He managed to bet in a local betting agency which is illegal.At last a mother,loving typical Indian mother,who is very supportive to her children. The theme of the movie is to show the reality of middle class dream in this expensive world.The characters are very well played and acted.If any one wants family drama with some good comedy I suggest this movie very much." 
" A compelling modest family story.","A compelling modest family story.It begins with a teenage girl and how her family is, its a story about a honest math professor and how he manages his family with a modest salary and without any additional pay. The modesty and the reality comes in many forms to the eyes of a viewer and moves many as most of our country have passed or passing through this phase and most of them do not know how to deal with middle class economy.This professor is good at math and thus good at home economics too, but when a huge expense comes on his shoulders, the question whether you give away honesty or stick to it and tackle it being the same person. This is a film so he tackles it very well a there is a bit of fate too so that's just a part of it.Now, it's expected, no twists, a simple tale that too confines to one middle class family only. Who would buy such theme, but the script is very well knit with the relationships turning from sweet to sour to sweet and how they fumble at times and how the family copes with those too. Thanks producers for buying this script as it has made the whole movie worth a watch and thanks for Rishi Kapoor for showing us what it means to be a simple man with all eccentricities controlled.The most prominent thing is the chemistry between Rishi and Neetu Kapoor who has just translated their real life chemistry to reel and have brought it out so well that for the most part I forgot their real names too.The other most important thing is the costumes and the art direction, the locales are so natural that you can feel being at a home amidst known acquaintances. It took me to a known world where people were behaving as they should and as expected.And the winner is the script that came out so well with a theme that could have easily faltered if not enacted or directed well.All kudos to the director and writer Habib Faisal, man you have brought an earnest and a worthy winner in times where people look for quick money and values seem to be fading.This movie deserves a watch and such themes be brought out more.My rating is 4/5 for one of the best movies of year that brings tears of joy at the climax." 
" Simple yet educational family drama","This movie has depicted the lifestyle of a lower middle class Indian family in the most appropriate and comical way.Teachers do not get as much salary as engineers or doctors, but they shape the future because they decide what our coming generation is going to be like. Of course with the increasing popularity of massive open online courses, a teacher's relation with his students on a personal level is decreasing day by day. But that does not mean, that teachers are not going to be important. Something very similar to this is proved in this movie.It showcases a lot of things that can go wrong in a family. From quarrels to sulks, from shouts to tears, from over-confidence to regret, you will get to experience almost all the emotions.Go enjoy these little moments of joy!" 
" Feel the same pain as duggals","The simplicity with which the director Habib Faisal tells the story is outstanding.The problems and dilemmas of the middle class families in India has been portrayed in a humorous way.The movie starrer most famous and perfect couple of bollywood,Rishi and Neetu Kapoor,and as always,they are brilliant in their characters. Do dooni chaar depicts the hard times of a middle class family has to go through.Life can be tough for a man who teaches in school and also giving tuitions,make the future of many student but cant make their own children future due to their less salary.The story,the scenes and the problems are something that we can relate to.It touches our heart many times and we all the same pain as the Duggals."
