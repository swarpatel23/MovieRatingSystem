" Pot-pourri of the Human Condition","Looks at the riots of 1984 caused by the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the massacre of the Sikkhs in the bloody reprisals that followed. A love story and family wrangles are interspersed with the political/social commentary as are some singing and dancing interludes, making this film a little hard to classify. What starts of in typical Bollywood fashion as a light romantic comedy, then plunges into some extremely disturbing footage of atrocities and then manages to shift again into a retro village drama scenario." 
" Best movie.","This is one of the best Indian movie I've ever seen. The story was very good. Direction and acting was also very good."
