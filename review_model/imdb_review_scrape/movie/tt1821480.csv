" A rare combination of performance, script, direction, and aesthetics that will leave you stunned","Leave your bag of popcorn outside the theater. You would honestly not have the time to crunch it as you watch this fantastic film with bated breath. For Kahaani is a ride so thrilling, your mind would be tripping with a million possibilities, even as your tongue invariably ends up either tied, or hanging in the air with anticipation.Kahaani is essentially the story of a heavily pregnant London based Tamil woman's search for her missing Bengali husband in Kolkata, underplayed exuberantly by Vidya Balan. The supporting cast comprises a helpful cop Parambrata, a selfish detective - Siddiqui, an eccentric life insurance agent - Saswata, and a bhadralok Police officer - Khwaraj, and last but not the least, of a 300+ year old city - Kolkata seeped in the throes of celebrating the mother of all festivals - Durga Puja.The film unfolds like the pages of a gripping novel by Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and is shot like that of an Alfred Hitchcock or a Satyajit Ray. Using real people, places, and situations to underline the nuances of the story is a task that's handled brilliantly by director Sujoy Ghosh (also the co writer) whose recent claim to shame - an abysmal Aladdin, or a horrendous Home Delivery shall soon be forgotten just as Madhur Bhandarkar's debut dud was.In addition to the sterling performances and the plot is the terrific technical support. Be it Amitabh Bacchan's rendition of Tagore's 'Ekla Chalo Re', the background songs (mostly of RD Burman), playing innocently as the characters travel the length and breadth of the city, the costumes by Sabyasachi, the 'just right and yet dramatic' background score, the non-condescending cinematography that captures the city as if it were a character, and the supreme screenplay with a spattering of real Bengali, act as just the right spices to turn this into a delicious dish, that's both exotic as well as commonplace.Watch this film to experience something so satiating, you would surely ask for more (a rare for a thriller!). I give this a 10/10 not just because this is one of the best thrillers ever made in India, but definitely one of the best films to have ever come out of Bollywood. Kudos to the whole team! Trust me! Ami Sotthi Bolcchi!P.S: Please do not discuss the story with anyone else, unless they have watched this film." 
" Kahani -- A long awaited Gripping, Original Story with Awesome Direction","Genre --- Suspense, DramaReview -- Kahani is indeed a worth for your money. A sincere effort to portray an incredible story, which would leave you baffled, would leave you keep guessing what is going on and what would happen next. We have seen several suspense movies that have a good build up but are utter disappointing in the end. Even after the climax, it would keep surprising you till last shot. Truly a nice movie that you can with you Family and kids without hesitation. No abusive language, no "story Ki demand" type intimate shots. A clean and gripping storyline. I liked that fact that story did not pushed a possible romantic element neither unneeded songs between characters and kept it straight and focused.Story of Girl (Vidya) looking for her missing husband, is just the start. Movie is shot is Kolkata with characters that are real, you can relate and can smile to natural gestures. Movie keeps you clutched to your seat. Its a story of nice people stuck in their own mess up routine, offer help to the pregnant lady. Even with new actors, jumping in with their cameo every now and then, each has done full justice to their role.The story has been wisely written binding intelligent writing along with actual Kolkata.Verdict-- If you have been awaiting for a Good Bollywood Flick, with original narration and quality acting, the movie worth's every penny. A pleasure to watch with family or friends.Music -- Consists of two songs, different from stream line cinema. Amitabh Bachhan has brought a new spirit to Rabindra Da's "Ekla Chalo Re". The other song -- "Ammi Shotti Bolchi" is a authentic rock song on Kolkata theme in Usha Utthup's evergreen Bengali voice.Rating -- 8.5/10http://bollywoodwaale.com/movies.php?movieid=14Anjaneai" 
" Vidya Balan rocks in Kahaani!","Kahaani directed by Sujoy Ghosh is one of the most finest,efficient thrillers I have witnessed in recent times.The first half may be a bit stretched but still its good but it is the second half that keeps you engaged thoroughly and the climax is superb.Story:- Vidya Bagchi(Vidya Balan) playing the helpless , who has arrived from London to Kolkata in search of her missing husband Arnab. With a sympathetic cop helping her on this mission, Vidya combs every corner of Kolkata. But all leads go cold – the guest-house he was staying at, the National Data Center where he'd been assigned, even the Indian immigration authorities have no records of Arnab Bagchi. When it seems like her husband's disappearance might be inexplicably linked to a most-wanted terrorist, Vidya pokes her nose around in dangerous places, angering the Intelligence Bureau that is trying desperately to keep some secrets hidden.Sujoy Ghosh,who directed the disastrous Aladin in 2009, is excellent this time.Although there are many sequences in Kahaani which work,but since mentioning them would spoil the fun.The screenplay is taut and brave.The dialogs are very good.The editors could have trimmed the movie,to make it more sharper.The cinematography by Setu is stunning.The locales of Kolkata are a treat to the eye.The music is very good."Ami Shotti Bolchi" sung by Usha Uthup and "Ekla Cholo Re" sung by Amitabh Bachchan stand out.Performances:- Vidya Balan rocks in Kahaani.She is an actor to watch out for.She is amazing.Parambrata Chatterjee as Rana is sweet.Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan,the Intelligence Bureau officer is superb.Saswata Chatterjee is good too.Special mention of the two boys,one in the Mona Lisa hotel and the other as the tea vendor are cute.Amitabh Bachchan's narration at the culmination is fine.I am giving nine out of ten for Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani.It is not only to be watched for fans of Vidya Balan but it is also for those who are not.Its your loss,if you miss it." 
" This is what story-telling is all about!!!","First and foremost I would like to clear out one thing about me.I am a Bengali but in spite of the fact that I got a mesmerizing view of the Bengali culture and the city of joy-Kolkata (which I haven't visited for ages), this review is not biased.Ever wished you watched a movie that left you completely spellbound? Yes this is one of those movies that lingers on in your head even after you leave the movie theater.The star cast right from Vidya Balan(as Vidya Bagchi),ParambrataChattopadhyay(as police offer Satyoki Sinha/Rana),Nawazuddin Siddiqui(as second-in command Intelligence Beaureu),Saswata Chatterjee(as a hired assassin),Kharaj Mukherjee as a kind cop to the manager of Mona Lisa hotel and lastly the two kids who interact with Vidya is simply amazing.There are several high points in the film.Vidya as the portrayal of the pregnant woman delivers a range of emotions.She is at times tough and firm on finding her missing husband.At times, she is vulnerable,frustrated because of the missing clues. She is charming in the way she talks with the kids and playful in the bus-ride with officer Rana.Then the subtlety with which Rana emotes the love he feels for Vidya and the hesitation while picking locks to find out evidences.The brash hard talk act by officer Khan and then the evil menacing act by Bob Biswaas.Brilliant!!Moreover Sujoy Ghosh(the director) uses Vidya's pregnancy cleverly- every time she trips or even sweats too hard, you become afraid.The story totally grips you and leaves you at a dramatic high.And what can I say about the climax.Tremendous shock value!There have been very few times when I have experienced such pin-drop silence in the theater.Take a bow Sujoy..You have given Bollywood a gem of a thriller.For those fed up with the dark and gritty underbelly of Mumbai and the bylanes of old Delhi in recent movies, there are splendid sights of Kolkata and the iconic Durga Puja.It's a treat to watch the Howrah bridge,Hoogly river and the Victoria Memorial.Regarding music.Its great.The movie starts on a good note with "Ami Shotti Bolchi" and Amitabh Bachhan's rendition of Tagore's famous song "Jodi tor dak shune" elevates the mood to a completely different level.The director keeps the narrative clutter-free, sans any songs or side-track.Kahaani shows that when everything falls in place for a film — story, writing, acting, editing, cinematography, etc — things can't go wrong. Kahaani is one such film; everything's right about it.Watch Kahaani. Period" 
" \m/ must watch \m/","Do not listen to what people tell you based on the rumors, go and watch it!! The story is just fantastic!! A lot of thought has been put into every minute detail of the movie!! All of it to culminate in an awesome finish. Vidya Balan has as always done her bit perfectly and is supported well by her co-star Parambrata Chatterjee.The cinematography in the initial stages is fair. The direction is legendary. Every single scene has a part to play in the climax. Go watch it \m/. You'll be glued to your seats for sure!! And don't bother to think of what's gonna happen next, cos just like any awesome thriller, you're gonna be proved wrong ;P" 
" Brilliant script followed with top notch direction,editing, cinematography and performances..!!","Now this is some movie..Brilliant script followed with top notch direction,editing, cinematography and performances..Engaging suspense thriller..There seems only one ACTRESS in Bollywood at present..She was just too excellent..But the script was the show stealer..One of the best ever climax I've watched in Bollywood..Will blow away your minds..After watching the movie one will definitely doubt whether this is the same director who has given duds like 'Home Delivery' & 'Aladdin'. But he has given one of the finest cinemas in Bollywood with his latest flick. He has shown the true Bengal as one of the characters in this movie. Really splendid to watch some of the scenes shot in the cityVidya Balan is giving her best to date in all his recent movies. She hasn't failed yet. One blessed actress she is for the industry. No doubt even if she collects a national award every coming year. such a talented actress. So brave to chose such difficult scripts and make it look like cakewalk in the end is just amazing.All the characters in the movie have done justice to their roles. Every one complementing each other, the script the story & the direction. The climax is just so powerful and will give you goosebumps. Not seen like in Bollywood before. Don't miss out this Masterpiece..!! A must watch movie for all.!!" 
" Kahaani Is An Enthralling Watch :D","Who would expect that someone who directed 'Home Delivery' could create magic. Sujoy Ghosh's 'Kahaani' is a mouth watering treat for any movie lover. Right from the very beginning till the end the tight narrative keeps the viewer on his toes without any hiccups whatsoever. Starring Vidya Balan as Vidya Bagchi(Bidya Bagchi) as a wife who is in search of his husband Arnab Bagchi and in its course arrives in Kolkata all the way from London even though she is pregnant. The story follows her search at the same time playing with your mind with many twists and turns. After a long time have I seen a film in which every actor has given a peach of a performance and thus requires a special mention. From Parambrata Chatterjee who plays the role of inspector Rana who helps Vidya find her husband to Office Khan played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui to even Saaswata Chatterjeeas who plays the serial killer Bob every one is brilliant. I am really looking forward to more actors from the Bangla film industry to shine in Bollywood. The script is tight with loop holes you don't even bother worrying about and to add to that the haunting background score that gives you the true feeling of a thriller. Though it awkwardly seems a bit longer than its 2 hour running time I still won't mind watching it again. And yes Vidya Balan our very own Meryl Streep is almost certain to get another filmfare and national award. Of course the year has just started but i might just be disappointed if she doesn't get it. Ha! really satisfied with Kahaani.7.5/10 for Kahaani and another 0.5 for the collective acting performances of the cast. Audience which included a lot of family and friends - 3.5/5" 
" The refreshing combination of Parambrata and Balan and the motley of emotions and the ease with which they exude them in "Kahaani" make for an outstanding watch.","Setu's account of Kolkata is delightedly sincere and not superfluous cinematography - the dynamic colours and the simplicity of the artless lanes of Kolkata, admiringly, have not been lost in rhetoric black and white. The same forthrightness has mirrored to a huge extent in Suresh Nair and Sujoy Ghosh's masterful and impressive narration of Bagchi's fable of lost and deeply lost until found.Vidya Bagchi's (Vidya Balan) hunt for her lost husband Arnab Bagchi (Indraneil Sengupta) brings her down to Kolkata from London. With a seven-month old baby magnifying her power, an infinite exploration of the byways of Kolkata with the help of a local policeman Satyoki Sinha (Parambrata Chattopadhyay) begins. Disordered links and remainders of Vidya's past conversations with Arnab are her fragile hopes. Undeterred, the firewall specialist rummages through the tightly encrypted codes of the mystery, webbed by even more securely encrusted faces. The refreshing combination of Parambrata and Balan and the motley of emotions and the ease with which they exude them in "Kahaani" make for an outstanding watch. Balan's ability to tailor her sentiments - sympathy, anger and despair - multiplies the strength of her character. The swiftness of the movie leaves no time for the audience to mentally prepare for an upcoming situation. While Vidya accepts herself as "Bidya"in the City of Joy, gifts a chocolate to the kid in the lodge and breaks the lock of National Data Centre; the contract killer Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee) playfully murders people and Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) smokes out his dedication towards his work besides a mouthful of white air. Just when a wide array of emotions are at their peak and the frantic search is riding high, Amitabh Bachhan's rendition of Tagore's famous song "Jodi tor dak shune" transfers the mood to a completely different level. The festive mood of the city, the preceding and the succeeding of it, the red of sindoor and the expressions of the idols of Durga have been phenomenally well-utlised in the movie. Balan is a breeze of fresh air in Bollywood, which is suffering from the curves of furniture heroines and "Kahaani", another robust step after the recent "The Dirty Picture" towards reinforcing the position of heroines in a traditionally hero-driven Bollywood. The subtlety with which the soul of the city has been interlaced in the screenplay, while not losing grasp on the flow of the story even for a moment, is a testimony of effectual storytelling. There is not a single scene in the movie where Parambrata has been overshadowed by the presence of Balan. His acting skills are distinctly sharp and flowing. Sujoy Ghosh's choice of actors for the various characters in "Kahaani" has made an immense contribution towards the kind of impact it leaves on the viewers long after they abandon the theatre. After all, "Shotti" sounds better as "Shotti", not "Sotti". The climax, even though prudent and reasonably well-baked, is slightly dramatic and seems to conclude the movie before clearly justifying the actions of Vidya and Satyoki, especially the latter. The momentum of the story towards the end beats its own record and the circumstances merging with the mood of the city seems to be not so much of a coincidence. Bagchi's "Kahaani" is one of those that would define tougher standards for the forthcoming Fridays. Why on earth would you like to miss the benchmark? Watch it. Definitely!" 
" Salute VIdya Balan. Vidya Takes Kahaani to another level","Bollywood is branded for creating movies from a male perspective. The women's stories are not really exemplified conscientiously. But, out of the blue, the women-centric flicks is fast turning out to be a bankable genre. KAHAANI is a commanding story, has an authoritative central character, has several dominant and thought-provoking moments, which makes it an all-persuasive film. Vidya Balan makes Kahaani come alive. It is several notches above the stuff we've been subjected to in the past. The movie triumphs in evoking emotions. You experience compassion, resentment,defenselessness and triumph at a variety of stages. A wonderful movie-going experience, you come out feeling a sense of pride, pleasure and fulfillment after having watched KAHAANI. There no surprise if Vidya get all the best actress awards in 2013 also. Just do not miss it. Hugely recommended!" 
" really unexpected from Bollywood","from Bollywood which generally has no place for women centered films, here comes the most amazing powerful suspense packed thriller, starring non other than the charismatic Vidya Balan, the movie is a milestone and a rare treat from Bollywood, definitely a must watch. the screenplay is so tight to find flaws, and the supporting cast has done a great job. Although the ending is not as thrilling as the whole movie, but still it is exceptional and unforeseen, its still great.And I must say, i was disappointed by Bollywood..(this time they have done it original, no copycat/remake/based upon/Hollywood's copy).. pure original mind blowing suspense." 
" Kahaani Review: Scintillating Blockbuster, Must Watch","There are a few movies which will keep you glued to the screen. You will be sitting on the edge of the seat and your mind will be making a million possible permutations to deduce what will happen next. Very few of them come from Bollywood. If ever there was a blockbuster movie from Bollywood, Kahaani is better than that. Read on to know why Kahaani is a must watch.Plot: It's a crowded metro. Hundreds of travellers are waiting to reach their destination. They are killed with a chemical weapon. Two years later, Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) is a pregnant woman comes to India in search of her husband, Arnab Bagchi (Indraneel Sengupta) who has been missing. She can't find a trace of him and is determined to solve the puzzle. In the search for Arnab, Vidya stumbles on Milan Damji who is a lookalike of her husband and is a prime accused in the metro attack.All the clues to the case are being eliminated one by one. The Intelligence Bureau is involved and the hunt is on. Vidya is being helped by a local police officer Rana alias Satyaki (Parambrata Chattopadhyay). They are warned by the Intelligence Bureau to stay away but how long can they continue their search? Why was Arnab missing? What is his identity? Will he ever be found? These are, but a few questions that the story will answer you. Be ready to be taken on a roller-coaster ride.Analysis: The movie is a drama-thriller. This genre requires exquisite attention to detail and a very well written script. A small blunder can make or break your movie. Kahaani has it all. With a brilliant story (Sujoy Ghosh and Advaita Kala) and a screenplay that runs along at a pace that will make you glued to the screen, the director has paid attention to every possible detail to ensure nothing is left in a hush.Coming to performances by the cast, Parambrata Chattopadhyay as Rana is subtle and delivers a splendid performance. He is a well-known figure in Bengali cinema and his entry to Bollywood could not have been better. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, as the IB Deputy Director, is just picture perfect. It is tough to imagine that he is the same character who played the pickpocket in Munnabhai MBBS. In a role as a ruthless cop, he does ample justice to the role and delivers a power packed performance.Rest of the cast; Saswata Chatterjee as a hit man, Darshan Jariwala as the former IB agent, Indraneel Sengupta as the rouge agent Milan Damji and as Arnab Bagchi, and every other member of the cast have delivered wonderful performances and not one of them looked out of place.Finally coming to Vidya Balan, what do I say about her? With Five brilliant performances in a row, she is unstoppable. She manages to reinvent and elevate herself with every performance and in Kahaani she just does that all over again. If The Dirty Picture won her rave comments from even the harshest of critics, Kahaani has just pushed the barrier a few notches higher.She not only carries out the role with complete perfection, she looks every bit of the character that is written for her. She has conveniently steered way ahead of her competitors to stake the claim as the best actress in India. The review is stretching out too long or else I could have written an entire essay on how brilliant her performance was.The director Sujoy Gosh has just opened the gates to endless praise. He has handled the subject in a manner that would shut even the harshest of critics. The element of suspense is kept throughout the movie and not once does the script turn out predictable. Crisp dialogs, backed by wonderful performance just makes it all the more better.The camera work by Setu is apt; Screenplay by Sujoy Ghosh, Suresh Nair and Nikhil Vyas is just perfectly paced, Editing by Namrata Rao is crisp, and costumes by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (for Vidya Balan) and Suchismita Dasgupta just blend into the story perfectly. Music by Vishal Shekar is subtle and the rendition of Ekla Chalo Re by Amitabh Bachchan is just fantastic. In the end, the movie is a case of all the right things at the right place in the right hands.StudentLive's Verdict: I will just keep this short, Kahaani is a must watch. If Paan Singh Tomar started a different trend in Bollywood, Kahaani just takes it further. Don't even think of giving this one a miss. I will go with 4.5 out of 5 for Sujoy Gosh's Kahaani. It is a wonderful gift to cinema on Women's day and Holi.P.S: Pardon me for the slightly lengthy review, Kahaani deserves every bit of praise. Source: www.studentlive.in" 
" A Nutshell Review: Kahaani","The film begins in 2008, where we bear witness to an unnamed man whose identity is hidden behind a gas mask, experimenting with a lethal chemical gas on lab rats, before we get to the city of Kolkata where the same weapon of mass destruction got used in a terrorist attack on a subway train that unfortunately wasn't stopped in time. This almost stand-alone setup and prologue will keep you guessing its significance to its story, since the film continues two years later, where Balan's Mrs Vidya Bagchi arrives in the same Indian city from London in search of her husband Arnab (Abir Chatterjee), who as a software engineer worked at the National Data Centre and maintained daily contact until his sudden disappearance two weeks before, with the uncharacteristic cessation of contact prompting his wife to travel thousands of miles to look for him.Worried, the heavily pregnant Vidya heads straight to the local police to file a missing persons report, and from there starts to visit some of the regular joints her husband could have been in, including his hotel room which had absolutely no traces of the man, nor with people she encountered at those places having any recollection of having seen him, based on their hastily taken matrimonial photo. Assisted by policeman Rana (Parambrata Chaterjee), a slight, mild mannered cop, they soon stumble upon an investigative web filled with unanswered mysteries, and a bewildering suggestion that her husband may not be who he had claimed to be all along. The name Milan Damji gets floated about, a government agent in the mould of Jason Bourne, who may hold the key to Arnab's disappearance, again with clues that he may be more than meets the eye, and at this point your imagination will start to run wild as to the myriad of possibilities the story written by Sujoy Ghosh could turn out.Ghosh also takes on directing responsibilities, and he has crafted one heck of an engaging thriller amongst some of the best I've seen with scheming twists and carefully plotted turns involving government officials, beat cops, and Intelligence Bureau officers led by the non- compromising Khan (Nawazuddin Sidiqui), who epitomizes a no-nonsense approach with a willing streak to sacrifice pawns to nab the king. With Vijay pushing for the truth, a slew of bodies start turning up courtesy of a hired killer set loose to silence everyone she talks to, giving rise to that sense of danger and death at every wrong turn, it's a closely matched up cat and mouse game everyone seems to be playing against one another on both sides of the law, with Khan's questionable tactics giving rise to the propensity of collateral damage authorities are willing to suffer for the sake of the greater good.But Ghosh also remembered to balance his superb thriller with emotional anchors, and does this brilliantly through his crafting and development of the protagonists Vijay and Rana, whom we journey together in their search for facts and truth. They play off each other's strengths like Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, with Rana's unassuming disposition balancing Vijay's sprightly nature and relentless determination, making this one of the best cop- civilian pairing I have ever seen as well, being all natural and therefore believable. Credit has to go to Vidya Balan for her sensitive portrayal as a woman hell bent on tracking down her loved one and seeking closure to the sudden mysteries in her life, and Parambrata Chaterjee for his portrayal of a man taking it upon himself to help, and unwittingly finding himself being attracted to and infatuated with someone he has sworn to protect as well. It is this forbidden attraction and romance that's underlying and brewing that he brings out well without going over the top, exhibiting loads of sentimentalism that worked wonders for their chemistry with each other.Production values are top notch. I absolutely love the gorgeous city of Kolkata which I've seldom seen in Indian films, and here we weave in and out the crowded, bustling city area and into much laid back neighbourhoods, with a fantastic capture of very natural misc-en- scene being a lovely ode to the city, featuring its sights, sounds, people such as the working class from tea sellers to master craftsmen, and festivals. Production designers Kaushik Das and Subrata Barik ensured a very natural look and feel, while cinematographer Setu didn't impress me much with his shaky cam technique that had plagued too many Hollywood films he tried to emulate, but thankfully the second half of the film decided to ditch that misguided documentary feel for camera work that's more sustainable and traditional. The music by Clinton Cerejo and Shekhar Ravjiani worked extremely well in the background without bringing in too much attention to itself, nor do we have jarring breakaway musical interludes to blunt the storyline. Such is how everything worked together to complement everything else in the making of the film, to churn out a result that's worthwhile of repeat viewings for clues that one may have missed the first time round. It's filmmaking and storytelling at its best, and even I was more than glad to have decided to watch this instead of postponing it. Kahaani propels itself into my shortlist as one of the best this year, and it is certainly highly recommended if you're desperately looking for an intelligent story, great performances, a film that went the whole nine yards in its desire to become a classic." 
" ... The Changing Face of Indian Cinema.","Let me say right now that this is not your usual Bollywood run-of-the-mill. If you are expecting typical Bollywood masala with hide and seek romance, dancing around trees, superhero fight scenes and 'filmy' dialogue, you will find it in the remaining 999 films that the Indian film industry has on the 2012 assembly line. What works for "Kahaani" is its atypical narration arising from a well written story, first class cinematography in tandem with good soundtrack, and the performance of a leading actress whose very mention signals the changing face of Indian cinema.Arriving from London, a heavily pregnant Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) heads straight to the Kalighat police station in Kolkata to enquire about her missing husband. With the help of Rana (Parambrata Chatterjee), a rookie cop, Vidya begins to unravel the mystery behind her husband Arnab's disappearance. Together, their investigation leads to dead ends, but not before learning that Arnab may be linked to a terrorist agent operating as a mole within the Indian Intelligence Bureau. Wrestling with this possibility, Vidya finds herself digging into a high profile federal cover-up, even as an assassin trails her every move.Co-written by director Sujoy Ghosh, "Kahaani" is a well crafted thriller that is simply too good by Bollywood standards, current or past. Gosh has not only set a new benchmark in Indian cinema, his overall production quality is far superior to some of his counterparts across the globe. Even so, the true mettle of his work is in resisting the temptation to glorify India's stand on terrorism through nation-wide propaganda. Instead, Gosh pays close attention to the screenplay and how it develops through the narration. Pacing is consistent with a serious tone, but well punctuated with some suspense driven moments and subtle humor when you least expect it. Another strongpoint is in keeping the audience guessing all the way to the diabolical twist in the end. To avoid spoiling the surprise, I will just say that this could be borrowed from a certain Angelina Jolie film, but be that as it may, the conclusion here is totally unpredictable and forms the icing on the cake. There are some factual and chronological goofs but there is no point going there because no film is 100% perfect.Dating back to the late 17th century, cinematography captures the historical essence of one of India's oldest cities – a 300 year old artifact if you wish – in superb celluloid rendition. Gosh gives Kolkata a pulsating heart without unnecessary exaggeration, while simultaneously capturing the hustle and bustle and nooks and crannies of the city with deft camera work. Using this huge backdrop along with the festival of all festivals, The Durga Puja, Gosh underlines the film's formidable theme of motherhood in seamlessly integrating the fragility of a woman with her in-built yet God-given power to sustain life. From joy to heart-wrenching sorrow, Vidya Balan personifies this ideology with perfection. Fresh off the critical success of "The Dirty Picture", Balan is emerging as a powerful force in female driven plots. While this could very well change the perception on Indian cinema, this a welcome change and one that is long overdue. I am smitten as I am awestruck. Also worth mentioning are Parambrata Chatterjee as Rana and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a difficult IB agent. Together, their roles add vital support to Balan's as well as holding up the plot structure.As this is my first Hindi movie review, I only hope that I have given this movie the recognition it deserves. Considering my fondness with all things Hollywood, Ms. Vidya Balan and director Sujoy Ghosh have renewed my faith in Indian cinema. I cannot wait to see Balan's next movie. Watch this space." 
" A Compact thriller which should be seen to witness that great thrillers are made in India too :)","A perfect noir or thriller is like a Cornetto Ice-cream which you start licking with excitement that doesn't fizzle away in the course of your action. In fact temptation gets multiplied as your taste bud is surprised with hidden nuts, choco chips, wafers along with added flavor which makes one forget about everything. In the very end one finds that unexpected solid chunk of chocolate whose aroma stays in your mouth for hours. Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani is one such taut thriller that will engross you with interesting twists and turns gradually reaching the climax that takes a complete somersault. From the very first scene of a man in a gas mask testing some lethal chemicals on rats in a lab, Kahaani has you gripped. And then enters Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant women in an unknown city in search of her husband Arnab Bagchi who is a scientist working in NDC, Kolkata. There lies the mystery as from every corner Mrs Bagchi is proved that her husband hadn't been to this city. Even his existence seems to be a mere figment of imagination. Things get complicated as IB department of country shows interest in the case. Revealing a single suspense of this gripping thriller will be a crime and it is must watch for all lovers of suspense thriller. Sujoy Ghosh's script as well as direction is restrained yet poignant with metaphors revolving around Maa Durga and her fight with Asura (the demon). It is one of the rare scenarios where the script and the execution respect audience intelligence. In fact the ending compels the audience to revisit the scenarios and then one realizes the dots do connect. That's the most successful poi of this riveting thriller which can be compared to best of the thrillers in the world. The cone of this Cornetto is city of Joy Kolkata who is the true protagonist of the tale. The violence lurking in the by-lanes of the city, the mystery flowing with the murmuring sound of the Ganges, there is an air of conspiracy and Ghosh's script rightly captures that. Ritesh Shah who wrote the dialogs of the film deserves mention to consummately penning down the thoughts of Ghosh. Thankfully there is no cliché involving Kolkata which were shown in earlier film made on this city. Adding to the beauty there is Setu's camera-work which portrays Kolkata like never before in Hindi celluloid. Ghosh is gifted with brilliant technical team who did their best to make a captivating thriller in such a shoestring budget. Namrata Rao is another "hero" of the film. She gave the razor sharp cuts much needed in a thriller like this and her editing abilities will surely get her phone ringing for more thrillers. The background score did the much needed haunting effect to compliment the proceeding without going overboard. There are two songs in the film. "Ami Sotti Bolchi" which is there in the beginning is kind of introduction to the city as well as story. Usha Utthup's voice creates the aura of suspense. Amitabh Bachchan rendered his voice to Tagore's "ekla chalo re" which somehow worked. Vidya Balan is the pillar of Kahaani. Her character V(B)idya Bagchi is epitome of strong quintessential woman who is strong to take care of herself and at the same time vulnerable to regular emotions of life. This is the role which actresses will die for and luckily the role chose Vidya Balan who is beyond competition. One of the finest actress of our generation she can display any role with perfection. From Ishqiya to Paa, No one Killed Jessica she went a notch higher with The Dirty picture and now sealed the top spot with "Kahaani". She deserves the best actress awards once again. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the loud mouthed IB office Khan had superb screen presence. His voice modulation will lead him to such meatier roles in near future. Parambrata Chatterjee aptly cast as Inspector Sinha added the soft side to the story with his unsaid love for Vidya. He was powerful even when he didn't mouth any dialogs through his expressive eyes. Saswata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas was scene stealer. Whenever he landed on screen people knew something is going to happen and with his expression he just stole the show. One of the finest actors in Bengal today, he must get noticed after this brilliant performance, in national circuits as well. His scenes with Vidya in the metro station just prior and after the interval are one of the best sequences of the film. Revealing his character will die down certain elements of suspense. Kharaj Mukherjee as podge thana head was adequate and provided some comic relief without getting too loud. Indraneil Sengupta, Dhritiman Chatterjee, Darshan Jariwala, Falguni Chatterjee (as manager of Monalisa lodge) let their presence felt. Special mention to the two kids who can give the big stars run for their money. Kahaani again proved Story is the real winner. If you have a good story you can compromise on budget and still make a engaging film. Kahaani should become a guide book for those who want to make thrillers. With Agent Vinod,Shanghai,Talaash on the cards hopefully good thrillers will revive in celluloid. Till then salute to the whole team of Kahaani and hope Sujoy Ghosh forgets his "Alladin" days and make another thriller as riveting as Kahaani. Watch Kahaani and experience neo-bollywood aami sotti bolchi!!" 
" Super script...","Well to start with, the plot was really awesome. since the beginning of the movie i doubt no one has ever wondered that vidya is going to play a crucial role at the end. the movie is basically about terrorism but it has been portrayed to maximize the presence of a female character who was looking for her husband. If we try to see in depth, the movie itself contains a lot of things which we are not aware. Govt loopholes, carelessness and similar things. I would say this movie should be taken as an example of how we can really look for true crime operators.Kudos to the director. Extraordinary direction and scene selection. Thanks a lot." 
" An excellent contemporary film!!!","I watched this movie today. A very good natural movie pictured in a simple way without any camera tricks or hi-fi shots. Vidya Balan has really acted well. Parambrata Chatterjee, a new face has done justice to his role. In a nutshell its a serious movie of social relevance with an element of suspense, which we cannot predict. Unlike usual movies, this is a female-oriented movie executed well especially by Vidya and the other cast & crew. We have seen in the past many bold leading actress like Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, who were not just "heroines supporting heros". Vidya is such an actress of great talent and caliber in this era.Its a good watch. I give an 8/10 for this movie."
