" Disastrous film of Rajesh Khanna","Rajesh Khanna seems to be out of work in last few years and perhaps he was trying to cash on the glory of such a sleazy film for a comeback The film is simply nonsense with stupid scenes and over the top hamming by Rajesh Khanna, a real torture Check out the scene when Rajesh Khanna gets asthmatic attack while making out, there are several scenes that are pure tortureDirection is bad Music is badRajesh Khanna makes you tear your hair with his brainless hamming, Laila is irritating too, both are on heavenly board now rest are okayThe film was a disaster and was outrighly rejected by the audiences" 
" Poor concept but still worth to watch.","Well,i recently watched this movie and honestly say that it really disappointed me,really poor and weak concept but still coming of the legend Rajesh Khanna after a long ago was good to watch.What is the story is that Rajesh Khanna has married a very young woman(Laila Khan)who after marriage is not satisfy sexually with him and starts her affair with another man Raj secretly,but soon she is caught in big problem when her old husband comes back.Now after analysing the story you will be able to think that there is nothing new in this movie to waste money for.Some bold scenes in the movie by Laila Khan was good.My vote for this movie is 4/10."
