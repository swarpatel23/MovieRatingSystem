" The movie is OK","The movie is OK. It's nothing special. Same old same old. Emran Hashmi is very cute and all but he needs to seek new types of roles. He is a 'womanizer 'again' in this movie. Diya is a bar dancer whose brother is mentally disabled. Emran falls in love with Diya but can't marry her or else he loses his wealth. When he confides in his grandma, she tells him to marry the girl his father wants him to and continue his affair with Diya. Diya refuses. Emraan's uncle Jouh who is extremely close to him dies which makes Emraan realize that money stays here love goes with u. Therefore, he decides to get married to Diya and live his life as a poor guy but his grandma says he will get the money. There, nothing special, right?" 
" Poor Man's Sharaabi","Anurag Basu who partly directed KUCH TO HAI(2003) and directed SAAYA(2003) both flops and then gave a superhit MURDER(2004) returned in few months later with Bhatt's nephew Emraan Hashmi with TUMSA NAHIN DEKHA The first teaser was out showing Emraan kissing Dia forcibly on the street and it created a rage, People thought it was Murder 2 but sadly the film falls flat on it's face. Not because it doesn't hav much kissing other then that scene, the problem is that it comes across as a poor man's SHARAABI(1984) SHARAABI still remains one of AB's best films though it was copied from Hollywood movie ARTHUR now Bhatt too copies from the same original movie and much more then Sharaabi. The film does have some good scenes but very few to outdo the harm done. The scenes between Dia and Emraan and their love story is well handled, Dia's change of feelings for Emraan is well handled, The twist also is well handled but sadly Anurag Basu or Mahesh Bhatt( as per trivia Anurag was hospitalised in between of the movie and rest of the movie was completed by Bhatt) don't know whether to make an emotional film(Bhatt's hallmark) or make a romantic film or make a comedy.Bhatt films never boast of great comedy, who can forget the rubbish Duplicate though some lighthearted films of theirs were good like HUM HAI RAAHI PYAAR KE but mostly their comedies were overdone and never one of their hallmarks. Another drawback is the predictability in the movie, The attempts to humour fall flat, we have exxagerated characters, too many songs and the climax that tries really too hard Emraan's relationship with Anupam Kher though a pale shadow of Amitabh and Om Prakash in SHARAABI is well handled and also Anupam's death is well handled but the climax falls flatDirection by Anurag Basu/Mahesh Bhatt is average, some scenes are well handled but many scenes are overdone, the best scenes are between Emraan and Dia, Emraan and Anupam, Emraan and Dia's brother but the screenplay ruins things and also they should've made the film a dramatic film or romantic film and chosen a better plot Music by Nadeem Shravan is awesome, the songs are seeped in melody though most sound like Bhatt leftovers from 90s yet some songs are superb and well picturised, the best song is Yeh Dhuan sung beautifully by Roop Kumar Rathod and Shreya Goshal, Bheed mein is superb too, Maine Soch Liya, Woh Humse Khafa Hai, Dhanak Ka Rang and Mujhe Tumse Mohabbat Hai all come with valid situations Camera-work is decent though some scenes could be better lit, besides Dubai has been passed off as Mumbai in several scenes.Emraan Hashmi plays his part well, this was his 3rd film and after giving great performances in FOOTPATH and MURDER he yet again proves his talent especially in emotional scenes and romantic scenes but in comedy he tends to overact Dia Mirza looks good and does her job well Amongst rest Surekha Sikri does her role well which she does several times mostly on TV, Pooja Bharati is okay, Atul Parchure excels, Sharat Saxena overacts"
