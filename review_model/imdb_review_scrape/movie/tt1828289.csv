" Dishonesty serves no one","No nonsense no song movie taking place in Delhi starring Nana and Mohit Ahlawat. Hanumant Singh (Nana Patekar) Police officer, with differing principles, newly joined police officer Mohit (Mohit Ahlawat) ethical? play out this drama in a background of politics and goons. Hanumant Singh & Bunty Bhaiya (Anurag Kashyap) work for big political leader Rajmani Singh (Zakir Hussain), an usual corrupt leader.Numerous twists and turns dominate the movie with Rimmi sen playing the role of a journalist. Money plays a dominant role throughout the movie. Movie is well made without any heroes or villains as all are gray shady everyday characters." 
" Cops, Suspense, Nana","Shagird is the movie every fan of Ab Tak Chhappan has been waiting for. Nana Patekar reprises his encounter specialist cop act, this time in darker shades for director Tigmanshu Dhulia and again carries the film on his veteran shoulders. It finally portrays Dhulia's potential which was being promised to us for long and delivers a thrilling chor-police movie, though not as memorable as Ab Tak Chhappan perhaps.From the beginning we find out that the film is a no-nonsense gripping thriller with the emphasis on storytelling rather than traditional Bollywood entertainment. There isn't much on the songs front, but there are enough twists to make even the experienced fan interested as the story never gets too predictable.Youngster Mohit Ahlawat has been given a golden opportunity to shine alongside Nana and almost makes the most of it. Zakir Hussain is outstanding as the corrupt minister and this could be his best performance yet. Shagird also stars maverick new-age director Anurag Kashyap in his longest role as an actor yet. But again, none of them would even be noticed if it wasn't for the charismatic Nana (who has recently given majestic restrained performances in Raajneeti and Ab Tak Chhappan and another one here in Shagird) as the no-conscience police officer Hanumant Singh who is like a demi-god in the Delhi Police, known for his bravery in the field against the criminals. But what lies beneath is what the young shagird, meaning understudy, Mohit Kumar (Mohit Ahlawat) finds out quickly. Does he have enough courage and grit to stand by his morals? Find out. Watch Shagird if you're Nana's fan or if you want to become one." 
" Nana Patekar - A Master Actor!","Tigmanshu Dhulia's 'Shagird' is a well-made, gripping film, that has many twists & turns on its side. But, above all, its Nana Patekar, who deserves the highest praises. Like Always, The National-Award-Winning Iconic Actor, pitches in a Masterful Performance & Own This Film!'Shagird' Synopsis: A rookie cop questions the tactics of his superior, and attempts to track the abductors of his girlfriend.'Shagird' went unnoticed at the box office, and that's truly sad. Its a well-made, gripping film, along-with some clever twists & turns. The film does have some minuses, but overall, the pluses outshine the minuses. Tigmanshu Dhulia's Screenplay is gripping & offers some very good twists. His Direction, on the other-hand, is competent. Cinematography & Editing are ordinary. Nana Patekar's Masterful Performance is truly the Highlight of this under-rated flick. The Amazing Actor sinks his teeth into the part & performs like a freaking rock-star. This performance is among his best to date. Among other performances, Mohit Ahlawat does a fair job. Zakir Hussain & Anurag Kashyap are superb. On the whole, 'Shagird' is a well-made film in all respects. A Must See for Nana Patekar Fans!" 
" A roller-coaster ride","Tigmanshu Dhulia had carved a niche for himself through his very first directorial venture - Haasil. And this underrated movie is another illustration of his abundant talent. It's a brilliant movie whose class can be felt and understood by seeing it only.Though several Bollywood movies have come before the audience which are based on encounter-specialists and several others have come which are based on the corrupt cops. However this movie is unique. It's neither Gangaajal nor Apharan, nor Ab Tak Chhappan nor Kagaar nor Ye Saali Zindagi. It has a class of its own. Encounter specialist cop, Nana Patekar is thoroughly corrupt and works for the corrupt politician, Zaakir Hussain, eliminating his adversaries and those who can prove dangerous for him. He gets a newly recruited junior cop, Mohit Ahlawat to work under him in the police station. The real drama starts with the kidnapping of some journalists consisting of Mohit's sweetheart, Rimi Sen too. Some hardcore terrorists are released for getting the journalists free and alongwith them is released the ex-henchman of Zaakir Hussain, Anuraag Kashyap. How the main protagonist Nana Patekar and his Shagird (pupil), Mohit Ahlawat get involved in these developments and what's the climax of this story is a treat to watch.Shagird is a rare thriller made in Bollywood which keeps the viewer spellbound right from the very first frame to the very last frame. There is no unnecessary dragging and no useless incidents to add to the length of the movie. Even the smallest incident shown in the movie has a link with the main story. It's something unusually pleasant and evidences the proficiency of the script-writer and the director. The narrative keeps the viewer hooked throughout 140 minutes long duration. The first half prepares the ground for the second half and the second half keeps on rendering electric currents to the viewer, scene after scene. There is a twist in the tale even in the ending scene. The superfast pace of the movie does not give the viewer any time to think. But it does not challenge his intelligence and after watching the movie completely, if the viewer ponders over what he has seen, he does not feel cheated because everything is logically knitted and in proper place. Even the title of the movie is just perfect according to the story told. The second half of the movie is just like a game of chess, containing checks and checkmates upon the chessboard of the Indian police system. It reminds of Abbas-Mustan's movie - Race in which it becomes difficult for the viewer to identify as to who colludes with whom and who deceives whom.Though the kidnapping episode is not very impressive and the Mohit Ahlawat-Rimi Sen romance track is half-baked, these are minor flaws in this otherwise highly admirable movie. The director has shown his better sense by keeping the movie sans any songs and the flow of the narrative is nowhere blocked. The background score and the technical aspects of the movie are topnotch. The action and chase sequences are outstanding. The cinematographer has captured Delhi and nearby areas quite realistically and impressively.I also admire the director for keeping the movie free from expletives which is also unusual now-a-days. Given the milieu of the story, he could have filled it with expletives under the pretext of showing reality. But it's very nice of him to keep the movie clean. He has not shown any vulgarity also.Nana Patekar has outshined his co-actors in the author-backed role of the smart, yet corrupt cop who is very fond of old Hindi movie songs and whose knowledge about them is extra-ordinary (like the author of this review). His role reminds me of the main protagonist of a Hindi pulp-fiction bestsellter - Vardi Waala Gunda (penned by Ved Prakash Sharma). However I feel that he is now typecast in such roles. Mohit Ahlawat has wasted a golden opportunity and he is just average. Anuraag Kashyap has proved that he is not only a class director, but also a class actor. Rimi Sen and others are OK. Murli Sharma leaves his mark in the cameo of a coward journalist. But the distinction marks go to Zaakir Hussain who has infused life into the role of the corrupt politician.Tigmanshu Dhulia has taken cinematic liberty of ignoring several aspects of the Indian police system in telling his story but he can be excused for that because keeping the narration focused at the desired place instead of covering several diversified things on a large canvas, has helped keeping the movie engrossing and entertaining. He has shown as if all the encounters and killings by Indian cops are motivated only and nothing happens in Indian police stations except killings for vested interests and warming own pockets which may not be true.My final words - I strongly recommend this movie for the thriller fans who will find the experience of watching this movie akin to a roller-coaster ride. Just sit in front of the screen and keep on watching it holding your breath tight. It's an edge-of-the-seat thriller.A great one time watch." 
" This is the best India Cop Movie in two decades","SALUTE TO THE WHOLE TEAM of SHAGIRD. No match to this movie. Much better direction and production, 100 steps forward to Ab Tak Chappan. Again you need sharp mind to understand this movie and enjoy the reality of Cop System specially about Delhi NCR's Land Mafia and politics. A MUST WATCH movie. I have watched it at least 10 times till the date and this will be a better movie to watch even after 10 years as I know no one can make this kinda movie in future too easily. This the best movie I ever saw in my life so energetic with better pace than any Indian Movie. You feel like you are watching some of the best JASON STATHAM action Hollywood Movie. Even there are too less movies which can be compared as good as Shagird in Hollywood too. JUST A REAL ACTION, DRAMA movie and if you know a little about Indian Politics and system then any one can enjoy this. While watching this movie you will forget about pop corns. Film making 10/10 Direction 10/10 Cinamtography 10/10 Acting 10/10 ..............n..........10/10" 
" Best movie of the year","Ít seems, no we ARE living in an era, where the majority supports commercial, soulless, romantic crap ass movies, with no message at all, except for telling us that the industry is pretty much dead. Best bollywood production until now of this year, or hell yeah last year as well, better then those show off movies of salman khan like dabangg, ( chosen as the best movie of last year, disgusting), Nana patekar is the best actor their is no doubt, and has worked out his character very well here, didn;t expect less from him, i watch character movies with soul, anyone who can relate do this instead of commercial society depended sheeps, should no no MUST watch this movie." 
" Simply awesome!","Simple awesome! That's how I'd best describe this movie if words were limited. But words won't do. You've got to watch this film to know what I mean.A cop story against the corrupt system, which is so often covered in Bollywood, but with twists and turns and action scenes that you will NEVER expect, and awesome dialogue work by Nana Patakar will keep you hooked for the entire length of the film.Music is alright, the storyline is the best. There is no choreography.Seriously, this film deserved more attention.9 on 10 for Shagird." 
" Its like AB TAK CHHAPPAN Part Two, but not as polished as Shimit's gem.","Tigmanshu Dhulia is one of my favourite directors, but I have always wondered why his films manage to get a very low profile release even after his established status of a talented director? Anyway looking at the promos of SHAGIRD, I was not convinced much as the film just looked like a sequel to AB TAK CHHAPPAN with Nana Patekar doing a similar kind of role of an encounter specialist. And after watching it I was proved right as the film exactly walks on the similar lines with only the underworld mafia being replaced by the political dons and some more corrupt officials within the police force.Usually Tigmanshu always comes up with a novel concept as in HAASIL, CHARAS and the forthcoming PAAN SINGH TOMAR. But for some unknown reasons he adapts an already very well exploited theme of Police- Underworld–Politicians nexus in SHAGIRD which was quite strange looking at his track record. May be he was too confident of the unexpected twists and turns in the script to get him some favorable results. But unfortunately, all those shocks about the hidden characterizations come too late in the narration and therefore fail to work in a big way.The first half of the film is fine but very similar to the one seen in ATC. In the same manner Nana is a famous rude cop who shoots before anybody speaks and his team has a fresh entrant as Mohit who has just joined the police force. As seen in ATC, Mohit too is afraid of killing a criminal for no reason at all in a fake encounter, which he later learns along with the changing circumstances. The movie takes a fresh turn when three journalists are kidnapped by some terrorists groups to get their demands fulfilled. But this kidnapping sequence only becomes the weakest part of the film as the real brain behind the plan and its hidden purpose all remain pretty confused in the script.Post intermission there are more shocking turns in the script which keep the viewers engrossed. But as I felt the twists come up rather too late in the script, which make the movie a bit longer than actually required. Moreover, the sudden weird kind of climax also leaves the viewer in a questioning state which is not at all a good sign for the commercial prospect of the movie. The abrupt change of characters in the script sometimes looks like overdone when we see no feeling of respect or regards in any character for his colleagues or friends.So if you are already a fan of the brilliant work by Shimit Amin and Nana Patekar together in AB TAK CHHAPPAN (which is also there in my 'Movies To See Before You Die' list), then SHAGIRD will not be that exciting for you since it's a mere extension of the same plot. But in case you haven't seen ATC then SHAGIRD may impress you a lot with its smart execution and fast pace. Basically SHAGIRD leaves a mark mainly because of the fabulous witty one liners spoken in his own unique style by Nana Patekar and a brilliant sensible cast brought together by the director and his team.No doubt Nana leads the film perfectly as usual, but it's actually all the supporting actors who all together give you an enjoyable time in the theater, provided you love the genre of hard-hitting political crime thrillers. Zakir Hussain as the Party leader is outstanding along with Mohit Ahlawat who is surprisingly good. Rimi Sen is just OK in her awkward wardrobe for a reporter's character. But the subplot of Mohit and Rimi's romance simply falls flat and irritates. As a bonus feature you get to see Anurag Kashyap, the director in the role of Bunty bhaiya, who is fine but nothing exceptional. The Cinematography in this song less film, needs a special mention here particularly for its opening shoot out sequence in the narrow lanes of Delhi-6.In all, SHAGIRD is a good one time watch, especially if you are a fan of Nana Patekar. But I was expecting a lot more from the combo of Nana and Tigmanshu. In fact, I found this as the director's least worked upon project till date. The film leaves you with a mixed kind of impact in the end and would appeal to only a limited section of the viewers. It's like a sequel of AB TAK CHHAPPAN but lacks the finesse and polish of Shimin's worth watching gem." 
" well written executed but movie direction is poor dramatic","Nana did great job as well as other actors director and story writers were same i guess but script was also written good nice dialogue delivery but somewhere in the direction movie felt dramatic even though deserves one watch" 
" Delivers Surprise After Surprise; Deciphers Human Nature. ♦ 71%","I am somehow surprised with the way this movie deals with itself. It showcases the various sides of human nature, most importantly greed.Corruption is in center-stage here as Nana Patekar defies the odd and establishes his own aura in the police department. His connection with the ministers go awry when greed kicks in & that is what the movie is all about. Supporting cast is great & the characters played by them is very genuine. A parade of surprises in the second half will blow your mind, as the plot paces. Anurag Kashyap & Zakir Hussain are charming.But, Training Day (2001) is better as Shagird goes low in film-making factors. No, Tigmanshu Dhulia is a genius, but camera work & editing & BG score are what I'm disappointed with. A little more polishing could've made me rate higher than 7.1.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for people who enjoy action-crime movies like Ab Tak Chappan! It entertains!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity: Mild | Violence/Gore: Very Critical | Smoking: Strong | Drugs: No | Alcohol: Mild | Sex/Nudity/Foreplay: No | Vulgarity: Very Mild" 
" A Cult Classic Shagird-The Disciple (2011) - India's Training Day","Tigmanshu Dhulia is a hit or miss director with his cult classics like Haasil, Paan Singh Tomar & Saheb Biwi & Gangster cementing his place as best directors of bollywood while his Charas ,Bullet Raja often counted as a miss.Shaghird is categorised in the later but I believe it to be a movie which is hugely underrated.A cop in bollywood movies is often depicted in a stereotypical manner a dishonest cop will be corrupt,selfish & stupid , while an honest cop will be courageous & intelligent.This is also valid for politicians etc.,the anti hero or a complex character is seldom shown. Hence police corruption is seldom shown in its true form, I believe Shagird is an exception & so is the Protagonist SI Hanumant Singh & likewise his Shagird SI Mohit.The opening scene is a revelation which shows 2 cops of Crime Branch extorting money from a businessmen.The police corruption in all its form is shown in the movie along with the Politician-Police-Gangster nexus & its depth in the system.Hanumant Singh is a crooked encounter specialist who works for a powerful politician & does his dirty work in exchange of the protection offered to him.He knows every written & unwritten rule in the book as well as knows how to break them for his good.Hence he acts as a extortioner,kidnapper,hired gun in his pursuit of money.He knows the limits of his relationship & hence is planning an escape from India but only blackmailing his boss the politician for the needed money by a threat of exposing his nexus with the criminal named Banty Bhaiya.Amazingly as most of the characters in the movie who are conned or harmed by Hanumant are bad themselves we identify with the character,also due to his dedication to family & his manners.His Shagird a new SI in the CB is equally smart but is also ethically sound which result in some witty dialogues delivered masterly by Nana Patekar who like Ab Tak Chappan is in tremendous form & fits right in,unlike Ab Tak Chapan, Hanumant Singh is more funny as well as more diplomatic. The subtle difference in the body language is absolute brilliance.The final twist is that like a true disciple SI Mohit turns out to be corrupt himself waiting for a bigger opportunity & hence he cracks a deal with the politician & story unfolds.A must watch for brilliant dialogues, fast paced storytelling & moreover as a relevant commentary on police corruption in India.A thoroughly entertaining & interesting view. PS it is only inspired from training day & not a usual bollywood copy." 
" Different cop film","Sometimes some films are not even watched by people as promos don't excite them or perhaps lack of stars who draw audiences and make crap films. By the promos i felt the film was another cop films done to death but the film is totally different. It shows cop in the worst light ever and yet it comes across as realistic and not caricatured. The film has several twists and turns and keeps the viewer on tenterhooks, most characters have grey shades Even the innocent guy whom we think will never go wrong, takes an about turn There are some flaws like the kidnapping part could be much better and more better depicted. In all fairness the film is entirely hatke and shows us some never seen before scenes Direction by Tigmanshu Dhulia is superb as always There are no songs in the film and thats a relief The tributes to old songs(Nana keeps giving trivia of old film songs) are well wovenNana Patekar is yet again flawless in his role only he could play. He is simply outstanding Mohit Ahlawat after no show in James and Shiva shows some talent this time, he is more loosened up and gives a good performance Tigmanshu Dhulia is known for extracting best performance anywayz Rimii is superb as usual, Anurag Kashyap makes a brilliant debut(surprising Tigmanshu made his debut in Anurag Kashyap's GANGS OF WASSEYPUR) and does a superb job though his role could be more meatier Zakir Hussain is superb though he has done such roles many times Vishwajeet Pradhan is unintentionally hilarious in a small role, Virendra Saxena is superb rest are adequate" 
" Old and dated Shagird","Old and dated Shagird Nana Patekar plays a smart cop who is not honest but likable. He mouths smart and witty dialogues, Kills anyone for money, wires money to New- Zealand and takes the politicos by his stride. Ab tak chappan guys is more witty and plays more dangerously for more green bucks. But the buck stops here with loopholes. Haasil director Tigmanshu Dhulia who once made a good college - political drama, doesn't go strong with Cop-politicians game. Indeed he calls it Chor -police khel rahe hai. The casting was good from the likes of Dil se and Bandit queen and so was the screenplay. The witty humor and rustic north Indian touch were fantastic . Although a senior inspector mouthing those lines may look unreal but was good. The Tarzan one was really hilarious.The casts include Mohit Alawat, a tall and handsome hunk into the police with the unfading dearth of mysteries around him. He is one actor play best without dialogues. Other casts like Zakir hussein was brilliant. Looks like the casting director Tigmanshu Dhulia himself picked the whole casts from Ram Gopal Varma's factory and it strikes a general note. Anurag Kashyap tries hard to play a cool Allahabaadi criminal and mouths some silly humors too. He was fitted in the character. Only misfit was the female protagonist, Rimi Sen, who plays a modern journalist from Aaj-tak covering all king of stories and wears a spaghetti top. The loopholes continues with senior Inspector holding a press conference, in-charge of terrorist kidnapping case, cops beating terrorists in tihar jail, embezzling crores of cash crops and many more. But when I treat this movie as Masala action twister, it doesn't betray me.The twists are boggling but story is flat. Nana Patekar plays Hanumant singh like the way he is. He got most of the screen space and screenplays and he did quite a good. He lacks when he cries and fails completely. There was no need to bring the old muse Hrishita Bhatt for kissing old politicians, Thank God, we were saved from another item number.The music and background score didn't made and mark and went unnoticeable. Not so Far yet Not so Near.It lies in between Haasil and Charas." 
" Fail","This movie desperately tries to be "Ab Tak Chhappan" but fails miserably. Nana is brilliant as can be expected. But Mohit still remains a non-actor. The movie fails because of a convoluted script which tries to be smart & because of a totally inept & incompetent director trying to helm things which certainly seem to be out of his forte (whatever that might be). I had hoped this one would be at least enjoyable than the usual Bollywood trash (with Ranbir's Shahids Imrans Akshays, Salmans SRKs et al) but I was severely disappointed. I can now gleefully strike off the director from my "looking-forward-to" list.If you want to watch Nana at his 'cop best', watch Ab Tak Chhappan - good lil movie with a decent script. Avoid Shagird."
