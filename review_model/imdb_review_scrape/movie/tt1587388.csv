" A documentary style movie which will make you laugh, cry and think","Supermen of Malegaon is documentary of a man's journey through a movie (a spoof on superman) making process with obstacles of money, communal restrictions , technology etc . Its the journey of dream of every man (particularly in India where everyone thinks its very easy to make a movie)to become star or star makers. It is a fantastic well paced comedy documentary with nice blend of human emotion in it .Through the movie you will fall in love with all those people who are involved in this movie making process (particularly the director and the guy who plays superman). Its a tragedy that movie of such class never got released in India but thanks that DVD is released so you can see it. I will rate it 9/10. A must watch for everybody."
