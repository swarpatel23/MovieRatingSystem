" Another regressive commercial trash","With Paan Singh Tomar, Kahaani, Vicky Donor becoming big hits it ensure that there are many sensible viewers who are ready to see mature films with hatke topics dealt in an entertaining fashion. While one hand there are film makers like Anurag Kashrap,Dibakar Banerjee, Vishal Bhardwaj,Tigmanshu Dhulia who are trying to elevate the level of Indian cinema and at the same time there are the Rohit Shetty,Sajid Khan,Aneez Bazmee and hoards of South Indian inputs decelerating Hindi cinema back to 90s loud inane films. I have no problem with commercial cinema. Even Rang De Basanti or 3 Idiots are commercial entertaining films but they aren't as regressive as Rowdy Rathore. The trend started with Wanted followed by Dabang,Bodyguard,Singham whereby you have a muscled hero fighting with huge sized villain to take revenge. There are ample violence, slow-mo action sequences and loud dialoguebaazi where by the hero acquires the persona of a superman killing all in the way. There will be a family angle to instigate some over the top melodrama and obviously a dumb bimbo who is there to titillate audience's hormones with her midriff. Sadly Rowdy Rathore falls in the same category with nothing new to offer. In fact Prabhu Deva has changed nothing from the original making it a loud meaningless film only to catch the attention of single screen viewers to earn profit. There is nothing wrong in earning money but there should be an aesthetic sense to do so. At least Prabhu Deva should have presented the simple story of a cop getting killed by goons and his look-alike taking revenge differently. The hero is louder than the villain, the heroine is dumb than the ass and the janata frustrated with mundane life enjoying the slow-mo brutal action sequences. There are ample songs with sexual innuendos which are lapped by the hypocrite audiences and even the censor board giving the films "U" certificate. IMDb represents world cinema and as Indian we should show some respectable cinema to world. There are numerous topics to deal with, numerous stories to tell. Many directors are making good films, even stars like Aamir Khan is making good cinema in commercial milieu which we should highlight. I can't force people but it is high time who give more respect to films like Shanghai & Gangs of Wasseypur (releasing soon) than lapping on age old formulaic films so that Indian cinema gives more and more fresh stories. The trend started with Dil Chahta Hai shouldn't go down. Even if they want to remake Southie films there are some great south Indian films which can be remade, why do the same thing just for the sake of commercial benefits??With Bol Bachchan & Chennai Express in the pipeline the scenario seem to be more bleak in terms of quality cinema  and the journey to regression continues :(" 
" Akshay is Rowdy!!!!!!!!!Don't Angry Him!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Rowdy Rathore directed by Prabhu Deva is a brainless film(story-wise) but a high-leveled entertainer with a new king Akshay Kumar!Akshay Kumar has been having a no. of flops right from Chandni Chowk To China to Desi Boys.Housefull 2 was a major flop among critics but somehow managed to be a blockbuster.But Rowdy Rathore is something different.Although,it has no story still entertains and captivates you!Story:Shiva (Akshay Kumar) is a small time conman in love with Priya (Sonakshi Sinha), a pretty girl whom he met at a wedding he wasn't invited to. Into this picture perfect world enters six year old Neha who inexplicably believes Shiva to be her dad! And if this wasn't bad enough, Shiva also becomes the object of a series of life threatening attacks by a gang of deadly criminals who seem to know something he doesn't. While trying desperately to save his life and love, Shiva stumbles upon a deadly secret. A secret that will take him to a small town in Bihar; a town terrorized by a ruthless politician and the mafia he controls; a town whose inhabitants only hope for redemption is ... Shiva!Several sequences work out in Rowdy Rathore,these are:i)The entry of Akshay Kumar as Shiva.The sequence where one could not help but cheer with whistles,claps! ii)The introduction of Sonakshi Sinha. iii)The entry of Vikram Rathore(Akshay Kumar) and the fight sequences following it. iv)The scene when a police officer's wife slams the chair of the villain. v)The start when Akshay and his colleague 2G share the money among each other.Truly hilarious. vi)The climax.Brilliant!The movie also has its share of flaws.The movie could have had a better story,even the,'Chinta Ta' step makes you irritated after a point.Even there are some scenes which preferably cannot be watched with family,like the one when Akshay Kumar stares at Sonakshi's stomach.Its humiliating.The direction is brilliant.Prabhu Deva does a good job after Wanted.The music is fine.The dialogs are clap-worthy.The action sequences are classy.Although they get a bit-violent but its a treat to watch how the hero beats the more than 100 goons in a slow-motion.Performances:Another thing of Rowdy Rathore is the excellent performances.Akshay Kumar is excellent.Be it action,romance or comedy,the actor has an awesome skill each type of role.He is the real Khiladi! Sonakshi Sinha is good too.She has acted very well and is much better than how she acted in Dabangg.Nassar is efficient.He rocks!Yashpal Sharma is fine.Paresh Ganatra is funny as 2G.Kareena Kapoor is so-so in a cameo.Shakti Mohan.Maryam Zakaria and Mumait Khan sizzle in the item song.All in all,Rowdy Rathore is a perfect movie for the weekend.I am giving it a seven on ten.Akshay Kumar is Rowdy,Don't ANGRY him!" 
" Low IQ Direction","Meaningless Disgusting Crap made just to earn profit. I don't really understand the concept of these movies,why are they liked in masses. They just followed the trend like previous bollywoods hits i.e Dabang and Singham - A Strong armed Police officer with mustaches. Wearing Aviator framed Shades, Tamil Fight action scenes. Senseless Dialogues repeated in every 15mins. Idiotic emotional drama. Idiotic Villain. Cheap Item song to attract pervert crowd. Akshay Kumar is a respectable person and a good actor,I really used to like him.God only knows why he's selecting such types of movies PS- The movie was so dumb actually made me write a review for the first time." 
" Sheer Entertainment!","Writing this review almost a week after Rowdy Rathore has released.So i suppose most of you would have caught up with the flick!But im writing it none the less. Before starting off with the review i must confess i have watched both the telugu as well as the tamil versions,Ravi Teja's Vikramarkudu and Karthi's Siruthai respectively.I suppose comparing the three wouldn't be of much use,as all three of them have their distinct style.But i would give Karthi a slight edge over the other two(But i maybe biased though):P Rowdy Rathore starring Akshay Kumar , Sonakshi Sinha and directed by our desi-Michael Jackson(aka) Prabhu Deva packs quite a punch i must admit!Rowdy Rathore as most of us know..is another remake from down south.And by and large most southern remakes have worked wonders(case in point gajini,wanted,singham). Now back to the review. The story goes about like thisShiva (Akshay Kumar), a small-time thief in Mumbai, falls in love with Priya (Sonakshi Sinha), a girl from Patna, who is in Mumbai to attend a marriage. Its love at first sight between the two. Shiva tells her the truth about him being a thief and resolves to give up crime forever.Enter a young girl called Chinki who thinks that Shiva is her father.Shiva is forced by circumstances to keep the girl.Shiva slowly starts loving the innocent child.Priya finds out about the girl and decides to leave for Patna.Shiva is heart-broken.All of a sudden a bunch of goons start chasing him and the girland another Akshay(Vikram Rathore) steps in to save them and ends up giving his life for the same. Cut back to the past.Vikram Rathore (Akshay) is a brave and honest cop who wages war against the evil ganglord (Nasser) of the village(Now where have we heard that before??:P) Now here..comes the twist in the taleShiva needs to take up the place of the slain Vikram Singh and what happens next for you to guess(or rather watch..but i suppose its easier to guess). To know what works and what doesn't with the movie..." 
" Akki the best ever action hero in India","Just finished watching Rowdy Rathore and I have to say this was one of the best performance by an actor, and one of best action masala movie in recent time, Akki shows those his contemporaries how to pack a punch with style, how to kick like Bruce Lee and how to look deadly like tough man Arnold Schwarzenegger. What an AMAZING EXPERIENCE!It has been quite some time since I watched a quality raw action movie in bollywood, with an actor who is technically better than all Bollywood action heroes, just watch the action sequence in the flashback scenes,, it was raw, gory and yet executed with some skills and technique, and wasn't just a one punch like other actors and the goons go flying. It was brilliant performance in both characters, with brilliant cinematography, breathtaking scenes and outstanding acting by Akshay Kumar. Sonakshi Sinha did her part well and looked beautiful.Finally, go and watch it, because you would regret if you miss such an entertainer in the big screen. 10/10" 
" The Rowdiest Film Of The Decade !","Just Came After Watching Rowdy Rathore....Now I Feel That No One Can Give This Below 8 Or 10 !!! Its An Awsum Action Packed And A Bit Comedy And I Would Openly Recommend All The Bollywood Action Lovers To Buy The Tickets Now And Go To Watch The Movie With Whole Family !! The Children Especially Are Gonna LOVE IT ! It Was A Long Time Since Any Action Movie....And If U Love Action Movies I Think That Will Want To Watch This Movie AGAIN AND AGAIN !!! Sonakshi Sinha Played Her Role Beautifully And The Whole Movie Was Balanced (Splendid action, Awesome photography, Breathtaking Scenes ,Some Raw Style And Of Course An Outstanding Performance By Akshay Kumar) !You Won't Be Wanting To Leave The Hall And Would Like To Watch It Again And Again ! You Wont Get Up To Leave The Hall For A Second ! So , In Short Its A Great Movie And I Would Recommend You To Watch It !" 
" Will Prove Itself as 'Bada Khiladi' in Box-Office","Shiva (Akshay Kumar) is a small-time con man who falls in love with Priya (Sonakshi Sinha). Into this picture perfect world enters six-year- old Neha, who inexplicably believes Shiva to be her dad. And if this wasn't bad enough, Shiva also becomes the object of a series of life threatening attacks by a gang of deadly criminals who seem to know something he doesn't. While trying desperately to save his life and love, Shiva stumbles upon a deadly secret. A secret that will take him to a small town in Bihar; a town terrorized by a ruthless person (Nassar). Prabhudeva does a fine job here and possibly better than WANTED in the field of creativity. WANTED was a dark and grimy present time action movie. But Rowdy Rathore has vivid colorful executions, the perfect 90's feel in every sense and ruthless action sequences as well as the dramatic parts. Cinematography by Santosh Thundiyil leaves a mark. Costumes are not a vital part but Niharika Khan & Prarthana Chadha's sleek costume designing comes to notice through many pretty outfits of Sonakshi Sinha. Even though Akshay Kumar's clothes don't leave a mark, but who can forget the 'Rangeela Coat's of Colorful Pants wore by Akshay Kumar in 'Chinta Ta'. Shiraz Ahmed does a noble work by doing some alteration in the main story. Sanjay Sankla's editing is top notch. Choreography is a damn good advantage of the movie as Bosco Martis, Saroj Khan and none other than Prabhudeva have left their mark here. That's why the songs are a delight to watch. Background scores by Sandeep Chowta impress.Dialogues by Shiraz Ahmed is perfect. After SINGHAM, such daring one- liners took place again in Bollywood. "Ilaaka Tera Dhamaka Mera", "Apun ka Phatka 440 ka Jhatka" and so on.Sajid-Wajid's music yet again leaves great mark after Housefull 2. The perfect combination of South and west can be easily witnessed in their music. Tracks like "Chinta Ta Chita Chita", "Dhadang Dhang", "Chammak Challo" and "Aa Re Pritam Pyaare" work wonders for the movie and saves the energetic feel in the movie. And one another extraordinary element of the movie is action directed by Anal Arasu. The films has three main action sequences. In the interval by Vikram Rathore, In the flashback portion by Vikram Rathore and in the climax by Shiva. The action scenes are sure to leave mark on your brains and hearts. The moves and techniques are awesome and makes incredible similarity with Southern hard-hitting action movies.Get ready to see Akshay Kumar in his top form. Besides his excellent comic timing, his ability as a prime-time entertainer resurrects through Rowdy Rathore. Akshay plays a double role in the movie. Shiva, a thief and Vikram Rathore, a tough no-nonsense cop. While Shiva is a entertaining role, Vikram is a serious, violent and angry cop which reminds me of Akshay Kumar in "Main Khiladi Tu Anadi", "Sangharsh" etc. The monumental act by Akshay Kumar takes the movie to new heights.Sonakshi plays a hot and sweet chick, different from her role in Dabangg. But this time also she handles her role very skillfully and her Indian traditional image yet again suits her.Paresh Ganatra as Shiva's buddy is funny and witty. Nassar as the antagonist manages to handle his part very strategically. The actor who plays Nassar's brother does well even his role is very succinct. Others like Mushtaq Khan, Yashpal Sharma, Gurdeep & Darshan Jariwala do their parts well. The child artist playing Vikram Rathore's daughter is very sweet. Kareena Kapoor, Prabhudeva's appearance shine the moments.On the whole, Rowdy Rathore is not star-studded but Akshay Kumar proves that he alone is enough to handle proficiently. Rowdy Rathore is gratification for the masses but will be hugely disappointing for those who are not compatible with immature entertainment. If you are a Akshay Kumar fan, please go watch it. If you love masala movies, keep this one in your must-watch list. Others who seek matured concept can easily skip this one. On the whole, Rowdy Rathore, just like its name is rumbustious and wanton and hits hard on where it's supposed to, entertainment." 
" A Nutshell Review: Rowdy Rathore","Akshay Kumar plays two characters here, each with his own half each side of the interval to accommodate the stories of ACP Vikram Rathore the fearless cop, and of Shiva the cunning thief, whom we get introduced having as glib a tongue as he has silky smooth hands every ready to pinch any valuable from anyone. We get up close to Shiva first, and his unlikely romance with Paro (Sonakshi Sinha, whose breakthrough performance was Dabangg). Vowing to give up his thieving ways to gain the acceptance of Neeraja, his henchman 2G (Paresh Ganatra) and he commits one last heist, only to find a six year old girl Chinki in the trunk of supposed valuables they stole, and compelled to have to adopt her in the meantime when she is adamant that Shiva is her dad. All these confusion will get straightened out by the time the interval rolls by, but until then, the narrative is relatively choppy, flitting between Shiva's pursuit of Paro, and his disdain for Chinki.But it's after the interval where things got a little bit more interesting with the story of Vikram Rathore coming into the picture, and making Rowdy Rathore pretty much worthwhile. Fans of many South Indian cop films will find this Hindi remake of Vikramarkudu in familiar territory, and films of the same genre will probably tote the same narrative structure as well, with honest cop blessed with super human strength (as part of the fun) going up against corrupt officials and thugs who rule villages with iron fists. In some ways it's almost serving a cathartic function of sorts, when films offer escapism to those who feel oppressed, and find an outlet to cheer for the unlikely coming of a hero, if only on screen. With anyone challenging oppressive authority, schemes will soon be in place to remove the thorn in any corrupt side, but I must say witnessing Vikram Rathore tear through evil like hot knife through butter, was really something that anyone can cheer to after a hard day's work, especially if one has one's fair share of injustice experienced during the day.It was publicized that Akshay Kumar hasn't played an all out action role since, well 7 years ago, but I thought Tashan wasn't that far behind although he had to share the limelight with his co-stars. Here he owned both characters he played, with the only distinguishing factor between Shiva and Vikram being the subtleness in the design of the mustache he wore for each character. Action sequences are naturally over the top in any Masala film, and this one has its fair share of incredible stunts topped with countless of explosions. There's something a little bit disturbing though in the action choreography, in its effort to follow Hollywood yet again, that slow-motion techniques favored by the likes of Zack Snyder, found its way to this Bollywood film, and in a pivotal sequence, looked very much inspired by Stephen Chow's Kungfu Hustle, even after so long.But the best parts of Rowdy Rathore isn't the action, but the characterization and the Indian- English dialogues they're made to express. In Vikram Rathore he stands by his fearlessness of death, and threats to anyone daring to put his daughter in harm's way, with that twirl of his handle-bar mustache and smile, capped with his mantra that he does whatever he says. Shiva on the other hand, although of less brawn but equally, if not more cunning, continues Vikram's good work as Rowdy Rathore, only to add a new flavour to Vikram's threat that he now also does what he doesn't say, sending his enemies into a frenzy only because they cannot fathom what Shiva has up his sleeves.The song and dance sequences got largely limited to when Shiva and Paro get to express their love for each other, inclusive of spatial travel to far flungs of India, and it's a little bit surprising as to the numbers of songs, and frequency the narrative got interrupted. With the second half intensely gripping, it got abruptly paused for a rock-song sequence that not only brought both actors out of character, but ruined the mood it so carefully set out to craft and instill a forthcoming brooding sense of revenge. Still, it managed to pull in more star power especially in its title track of Chinta Ta Ta Chita Chita with Kareena Kapoor and Superstar Vijay as cameo Item performers.There's a third story arc squeezed in at the end that came too rushed and was on overdrive to deliver the Rowdy Rathore portion. It was fun to see how the corrupt get their just desserts when having to go up against one of their own - the mantra it takes a thief to catch a thief - and the finale was a pretty much long drawn out affair that started off out of the blue with a sudden kidnapping of sorts. It's true that one can always fall back that a Masala film gets license to do whatever it wants to, but I just felt that if it could have been a little bit more disciplined with its structure, rather than to throw in curveballs on locales and characters, it had potential to become a cult classic. Still, for those of us who crave the quintessential Masala film in a long while, then Rowdy Rathore promises a rocking rowdy time!" 
" Paisa Vasool","Rowdy Rathore - the immensely hyped return of Akshay Kumar as Action BAAP - delivers what it promised - a Mass Action fiesta with a heavy dose of South Indian which now loved in Noth as well Masalas.The story is about Shiva (Akshay Kumar), a small 'Rowdy' who charms & steals not only wealth but also every ladies heart in a blink. Shiva falls in love with Priya (Sonakshi Sinha), a pretty and smart girl from Patna. Into this enters six year old Neha who believes Shiva to be her father -Vikram Rathore . The further movie deals with what changes and responsibilities does this little girl brings to his life and how he becomes the only hope for people of a small town in Bihar to get rid of a ruthless MLA Nasser and his mafia goons.Those who have seen the original either Vikramarkudu or Siruthai may find this one less appealing provided you are not an Akshay Fan. But for the majority of its core target audience this will be a perfect entertainment treat post IPL season that everyone was looking for.Its the perfect blend of comedy,over the top action, songs, dance, dialogues etc., everything that we were expecting from such a movie" 
" Rowdy Rathore = Solid Entertainment...!!!!","Rowdy Rathore is a 'Dkhamakedar' masala movie.....Akshay Kumar...... 'OUTSTANDING' he proves that he's the master of action.... With his dialogues he shatters the theater, Awesome. He has brilliantly played the role of Vikramsingh Rathore...Sonakshi is good but doesn't have much to do.Paresh Ganatra and the rest are good.The movie starts slow but the Interval point is earth shattering...!!!!Because of the slow start I'll rate it 7/10 or else I would've rated it 8/10.... This movie belongs only to Akshay Kumar, (Vikramsingh Rathore and Shiva....)" 
" Khiladi Rathore In Action!!","ROWDY RATHORE (Movie Review)ONE LINER:Khiladi Rathore In Action!!EXPECTATIONS:Expectations were high initially as Akshay returning to action after a long time, produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Prabhudeva directing His next venture after Wanted..VIEWS:Well this has again been a wrong promo policy. When the theatrical came and then songs promo came and then other promos came the film seemed to be over the top and cheap and below standard in my views. But after watching the movie I'll say that its not the case.. AK film KHATTA MEETHA suffered due to bad promo policiy too as it showed it as comedy but it was a nice serious movie. First 30 minutes of the movie are totally below average.. as the comic scenes at that moment does not create any impact nor the love angle is well shown.. but after 30 minutes the Movie goes on a high and high from when the girl came and emotional and serious RR starts.. then it creates a pure masala entertainer movie impact till end. STORY & SCRIPT:Story is old but the script is quite good.. Love Angle should have been scripted well.DIRECTION:Prabhudeva starts bad but after 30 minutes get the grip and never loose it till the end.. Only the Love scenes could have been directed well than he did..MUSIC:Music by SAJID WAJID is totally disappointingly average. TERA ISHQ and CHAMMAK CHALLO are the better tracks. In my view CHINTA CHINTA is totally poor song and its repeatedly use seems useless. Dhadang Dhadang and Aa Re Pritam just OK. Music could have been much better than this so as same for the background music.. it should have been better.CASTING & ACTING:AKSHAY KUMAR came back to his favourite genre Action and he has acted very very well in RR .. He is the most Positive thing of RR. He played role of Vikram Rathore with high and role of Shiva great to with his bravo comic timings.. He Makes RR watchable..SONAKSHI SINHA has acted quite good. But her role is not well developed.The character played by the girl of the daughter of VIKRAM RATHORE has acted very well .. She is superb.YASHPAL SHARMA & GURDEEP KOHLI are good..NASSAR as the antagonist is quite good.. really acted very well. the actor played his brother is ordinary and so his son character.MUSHTAQ KHAN has good comic moments and dialogues. Other actors are OK.PARESH as AK friend is just OK.PLUSSES & MINUSES:PLUSSES:1. AKSHAY KUMAR's acting.2. The emotional scenes.3. The role of the girl.4. Strong intermission. And strong post and pre intermission scenes.MINUSSES:1. First 30 minutes.2. Music.3. Background Music.CONCLUSION:Bare first 30 minutes and enjoy the remaining film as a great MASALA ENTERTAINER. AKSHAY KUMAR back in form..Wana Go for a Nice Dhisoom Dhisoom Entertaining Movie go for ROWDY RATHORE..RATINGS: 3.75/5." 
" Rowdy Rathore(Despite the Mixed Response) is a complete winner","Today I had the perfect chance to watch Rowdy Rathore and to be honest, I was impressed. The move is another masala entertainer like Dabangg. The film has the same typical revenge story and the funny and epic action to entertain. The first half of the movie is mainly comedy and romance. The second half is the actual part where the story gets its main grip with the twists and turns and the double role actually works out well. The actual twists are what make the story interesting. Yes the comedy is good but the move towards action and the change of the full storyline with confusion is a good feel. The movie is said to be the 3rd biggest opener after Bodyguard and Agneepath. Songs are good, Chinta Ta Ta and Dhadang is good while the others are fillers though the Rowdy Mix is pretty good. Akshay Kumar shines and he is the main reason to watch the film. He executes his double role well and his action is awesome. Sonakshi Sinha proves to be good after an average start from Dabangg. The rest are OK. On the whole, Rowdy Rathore is a good film though it is a typical story these are the kinds of the film that people like and I don't mind these kind of films. There were critics who criticized the film however the audience only wants masala action comedy films nowadays and the box office collections are the main proof. The final result is a yes, though the film may not be your best crtically acclaimed film it will be a good film. Go for the movie but don't expect the earth from. Another major fact to mentio is real Akshay Kumar fan you will love it, if you aren't an Akshay fan you won't like it as much as Akki fans. I don't mind Akshay Kumar and he is good and this movie is actually one of his best action movies. PS: Don't Angry Akshay and watch the film, it is his comeback to action and despite the silly action you wil still be entertained!" 
" Watch it for its second half like a Manmohan Desai masala film made in South.","A regular film-goer can recall several films from the recent past with a great first half and a not so happening second. And in most of the cases such films fail to make any major impact on the viewers as well as on the box office. But if a film goes the other way round then it has the most favourable chances to win over the audience.Luckily Prabhudeva's second directorial venture in Bollywood, produced by UTV and Sanjay Leela Bhansali comes in the latter category of movies with a fairly good second half as compared to its first. Following the sole motive of entertaining the viewers (keeping aside the logics), the director is mostly successful in its aim due to many engaging sequences post intermission full of action. And that is what actually saves ROWDY RATHORE from going on to a negative path.An almost exact remake of Telugu Hit VIKRAMARKUDU (2006), which was also remade in many other languages, RR strictly follows the path of its original without any new or major alterations made by Prabhudeva. He remains focused on the entertainment factor throughout but in the process makes an uneven film before and after the interval which drops at several places when it comes to emotional drama in the script. To explain the experience of watching it in its two halves, just imagine sipping an above average soup before going for the main meal at your dinner table. So, the first half of RR is like an OK starter with three fine toppings of a fresh & ravishing Sonakshi Sinha, few comic sequences of Akshay and 3 enjoyable well choreographed songs which don't let you write off the film right away. It starts off with a calm first hour stressing more upon the romance and less on the basic plot. But then Prabhudeva comes up with an energetic 15 minutes just before the interval which pull everyone back into the film forcing them to expect something much better in its next hour.Post intermission RR suddenly becomes an enjoyable ride with some well directed action sequences reminding you of the good old cinema of 70s which followed entertainment without any logic. In fact this better part of the film can easily be compared to a Manmohan Desai kind of attempt made in the South with fast paced sequences coming one after the other without giving you any time to think. For instance, the conman replaces the Inspector (Akshay in double role) without any hassles or questioning, the heroine follows him to the same small remote area as her parental town, the child simply accepts the second Akshay as her father without raising any doubts, there is no information given about her mother and the villains are easily beaten badly by a single man with his amazing power. But despite of all these glitches, the narration keeps you entertained with its funny one liners and well edited action scenes, not giving you anything to complain particularly in its second half. So if you love watching escapist kind of cinema, just for entertainment as earlier seen in Rohit Shetty's SINGHAM, then you would love Akshay returning to his action mood. Yet ROWDY RATHORE is not another WANTED delivered by Prabhudeva with a weaker first half.Therefore as a director, I cannot comment upon Prabhudeva's ability since he has only made "Strict Remakes" in Bollywood till now. The dancing maestro very well knows how to keep the viewers engaged and entertained in his movies. But how he would handle the same entertainment quotient in his own original project remains doubtful. Nevertheless in RR he takes ample support from both the fine cinematography and an energetic background score to generate a universally likable impact till the end. Also the action showcased in the film further helps him in generating a positive final result in a big way.Musically Sajid-Wajid have done a nice job but again they cannot take the whole credit here as the main track of the film "Chinta Ta Chita Chita" remains a true adaptation of its original Telugu song from VIKRAMARKUDU (2006). However both singer Mika and the Choreographers (Saroj Khan, Prabhudev & Bosco Martis) really deserves a special mention here, since the songs become hugely watchable just because of their great dancing steps complimenting the beats.Akshay returning to his favourite action genre entertains the masses both as a conmen and a police officer. But undoubtedly, he makes a much better impact post interval in all those action and confrontations scenes. Still, RR may not be able to generate the same response for him as WANTED did for Salman (which was appreciated by both critics as well as masses). The pleasant package of the film is Sonakshi Sinha who looks ravishingly fresh & beautiful on the screen, more than her pictures circulating in the print media. She definitely has a strong screen presence but only requires a good author backed role to prove her acting talent. Nassar once again excels in his role of the main villain with a superb portrayal of the Bad Man. Mushtaq Khan provides few lighter moments in the second half and Yashpal Sharma impresses in his helpless character. Both Paresh Ganatra as Akshay's friend and Gurdeep Kohli as the lady inspector are fine but Gurdeep surely becomes a victim of step treatment given by the writers.In all ROWDY RATHORE satisfies you mid-way with only a great & entertaining second half wherein Akshay performs in his full form as the action hero. But with less romance and more action thrown in the first half it could have been another WANTED for the director without any doubts. So for now, it may get a mixed response with a particular section of viewers (who love watching Manmohan Desai kind of cinema) appreciating it a lot and another slamming it down for its logics taken for a ride." 
" Everything is LOUD & EXTRA ...","If anything is to say about this movie .... Everything is Loud & Extra ! Extra Action, Extra Songs, Extra Sound, Extra Dialogues, everything is just loud & extra.May be that takes this movie to take great ups & great downs, there is no such thing in between.This is typical Bollywood movie with good songs, great action, some emotions BUT with south Indian touch.The movies takes following ups & downs of your likes, Don't like: First 30-40 mins story doesn't take even a start. Unnecessary songs, Akshay going behind Sonakshi is not that entertaining (& unnecessary) that makes you feel sad (for tickets)Like: Once the story gets starting then there is no stopping, at least for some time. Yes, till intermission you actually get involved in movie. There is not sonakshi & any other dramas, just a story.Don't Like: After intermission, movie still goes to the first part of unnecessary things happening, movie going bit slow & no where near the story things happen.Like: Yes, the end part or climax, this is again coming back to story & see lots of action & fun.It's really nice to see Akshay in this role, following Salman. Truly Akshay's best movie in recent times. Akshay has taken the part very seriously & reminds KHILADI !Sonakshi ... really don't know why she is in movie, but Bollywood film & without actress .. can't imagine, may be that's why she has done her job of looking cute & nice. But sometimes, she looks Rowdier than Akshay (specially in dance steps)Other South Indian Actors have done a BAD job in showing their BIHARI tones ....Those are laughing moments !Anyway, if you want to watch a bollywood movie, this may be good movie in recent years....Overall 6/10 !" 
" DON'T ANGRY ROWDY!!! go watch the movie!!","Finally , after a long time I have seen a fantastic remake of south Indian film which is , in fact better than the original!! Bodyguard , ready and wanted were disastrous remakes , but this movie is like Singham and Force. Story - Shiva (Akshay Kumar), a small-time thief in Mumbai, falls in love with Priya (Sonakshi Sinha), a girl from Patna, who is in Mumbai to attend a marriage. Shiva makes his way into Priya's heart and she also starts loving him. Shiva tells her the truth about him being a thief and resolves to give up crime forever. But before that, he decides to swindle one last person for a large sum of money. This leads Shiva to Chinki, a young girl, who thinks that Shiva is her father. Flummoxed by what is happening, but forced to keep Chinki with her {as a police officer (Yashpal Sharma) keeps his eye on him}, Shiva slowly starts loving the innocent child. Although he tries keeping Chinki away from Priya's eyes, the latter finds out about Chinki. Angry and hurt, Priya leaves for Patna. Shiva is heartbroken. Soon, unknown goons attack him, taking him to be a latter named Vikram Rathore, Chinki's real father. While many unknown persons help Shiva run to safety with Chinki in his arms, he is soon surrounded by the goons. It is then that IPS Officer Vikram Rathore (also Akshay Kumar) makes an appearance and saves the day. But he is grievously injured in the fight and later dies.So Shiva decides that he must fill into Rathore's position and finish off all the mafia goons, which leads him to a village of Devgarh.Acting - AKSHAY KUMAR GIVES A HAT-TRICK OF HIT MOVIES back to back with Desi Boyz , Housefull 2 and now ROWDY RATHORE. The whole movie rests on his shoulders and he does justice to his role in a totally fantastic and a brilliant way.His dialogue delivery is more than fantastic. Sonakshi Sinha lives up to the expectation and rest all performances are OK. Ratings - 8 / 10 . Don't angry Rowdy and enjoy this blockbuster!!" 
" Why can't i give a " ZERO"..!","God.. this movie is just a waste of money...Just another tees maar khan , Don't Angry Me! Akshay Kumar bellows this often in Rowdy Rathore. At one point, the command even plays out as background music. I think viewers need to keep their brains in their wardrobe to co-opt the line.To all the directors, producers, actors who are inflicting eighties-style, low-IQ, deafeningly loud, unapologetically crass, mind-numbing movies on us, I just want to say: Don't angry me! Don't exhaust me! Don't bludgeon me!.God why are u guys doing a assault on viewers brains..!!"
