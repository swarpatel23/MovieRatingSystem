" WOW! This is called a movie!","I am usually quite skeptical about the new bollywood movies because there is nothing much except flashing naked bodies, senseless songs, silly dialogs and stale story line in them. However, occasionally Bollywood does churn out some jewels. This is one of them and this one took my heart. The story? Is very simple, I almost knew the ending but I was still urged to watch it all. Why? I don't know why! But what I know is that the movie captures the life of a typical Indian middle-class family and puts it on the screen in the most subtle way. Especially those sensitive moments are portrayed in the most beautiful manner. For example, when Mithilesh (played by Rajpal Yadav) meets his to be wife for the first time, you can feel the tingling sensation within  i.e., the same sensation when you 'saw' your spouse for the first time before marriage. The story is so down-to-earth and close to real-life that you feel 'living' through it.Highly recommended! Kudos to the people who made it! A sure buy for my DVD collection to support such performances in the future." 
" This is a Real Good Family Movie.","This movie is special, it has nothing like special Effects or Fights, or abroad location songs. But it has one simple thing, and that is SOUL. This movie is so simple made and everyone can compare their own lifes to this movie in a way.The main characters are so good in their roles that you feel the smoothness in the movie. The first half of the movie is the best, the second half is gets a bit slow pasted, but still good to keep you in the seats and enjoy the movie.The songs are very good, especially the one when Kay Kay sings at the party, its breath-taking.There are so many movies where the directors go out and say this is a family movie, just like the whole cast of Salaam Namaste when they shouted out that its a movie for families too..but the ones that have seen it they know how Vulguar the movie was at times. But this movie is a true family movie, and Iam sure your family will enjoy it, mine did for sure..:)" 
" The Remarkable Rajpal Yadav!","Chandan Arora's 'Main, Meri Patni... Aur Woh!' is a sweet & simple film, that Proves what An Actor Rajpal Yadav is. In the lead role, Rajpal delivers a Remarkable, Tour-De-Force Performance that deserves an ovation. It's among the finest performances from the 2000's! 'Main, Meri Patni... Aur Woh!' Synopsis: A short, nondescript man, Mithilesh Shukla marries a tall and beautiful woman. Now jealousy and Mithilesh's own insecurities threaten to wreck his happy home.'Main, Meri Patni... Aur Woh!' is a sweet & simple story, that talks about a common man's insecurities. The protagonist Mithilesh Shukla, played by Rajpal, is a person who many can relate to. His jealously, low self-esteem & complexities are relatable to every common man of this country. The Screenplay wonderfully narrates & justifies the story of the common man. Chandan Arora's Direction, is good. Cinematography is perfect. Music is soothing.Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Rajpal's performance deserves an ovation. And its truly among the finest performances from the 2000's! As his beautiful & tall wife, Rituparna Sengupta delivers a restrained performance. Kay Kay Menon scores in a brief role. Varun Badola deserves a mention.On the whole, 'Main, Meri Patni... Aur Woh!' is an under-rated gem." 
" A breath of fresh air","This film brings in a breath of fresh air amongst the sleazy, slick films churned out of the Bollywood factories. If you had enough of big films with foreign locations, super star cast and dud stories, this film is refreshing. It reminds you of the modest budget films of the 70s featuring middle-class characters like those portrayed by the likes of Amol Palekar. Rajpal Yadav is superb and holds the film with his earnest acting. Rituparna Sengupta compliments him with an confident performance. Jehangir Chowdhary's cinematography of the every day life in the city of Lucknow is colorful and vivid. Although the film has a thin plot, it is watchable just for Rajpal Yadav's portrayal of a Librarian who has severe inferiority complex about his short stature and the misunderstandings that dwell in his mind as a figment of his own imagination. The film becomes too predictable with the usual clichés of misunderstanding inserted at suitable points. It moves at a snail's pace and requires some more content with sharper editing. Kay Kay Menon is definitely wasted, but does his job well. Nevertheless, I would recommended viewing this movie as it leaves behind to you the sincerity poured in this presentation by the director Chandan Arora and his cast." 
" A pleasant surprise","I must say if I had seen the cover of this film and saw Rajpal Yadav and Ritupama Sengupta as the leading cast, I would have avoided the movie altogether. Luckily I was really bored and this film was showing on Star Gold, there was nothing else on so I thought I'll give it a go.I was pleasantly surprised, from the first moment when Nasiruddin Shah was doing the commentary, I couldn't look away.Although, Rajpal Yadav deosn't have the qualities of our megastars in terms of looks, dancing ability and fighting, he was the perfect guy for this role. His performance was great, his facial expression reflected his feelings perfectly.His opposite, Ritupama Sengupta, also provided a great performance. The realism was great and I'm sure like myself audiences will be able to relate to some aspects of the story.The best thing about it was I genuinely connected with the characters and was wishing Rajpal to do the right thing.You will not be disappointed. Watch it." 
" simply charming!","A movie that tugs at your heartstrings with its simplicity and abundance of charm.Plot Summary: Chote Sahab (Rajpal Yadav) reluctantly agrees to look over a prospective bride, Veena. He sees her and falls head over heels, they connect at some elemental level and get married. So what's the problem? Veena is a stunningly beautiful, tall woman and Chote Sahab is a dumpy short guy. You know what they say about the insecurities of the short men.. He sees trouble everywhere - the vegetable seller, the milk man, the tempo driver, his friend, her friend, all seem to be better looking and taller than him! He tries to wend his way through this minefield of more suitable men, using means both comical (fires the milk man!) and slick (gets her to tie a 'rakhi on his friend's wrist!). But her friend (Kay Kay Menon) is harder to get rid of. Misunderstandings abound, the inevitable breakup happens... watch the rest.However, the charm of the movie is not in the rather simplistic plot but in its execution. Rituparna Sengupta is stunning as Veena - beautiful and vulnerable but never sugary sweet. See her in the ending moments of the film - stellar performance. Rajpal Yadav has been a favorite of mine since I saw him as the "video pirate" Guru in Kal Ho Naa Ho! Here he plays the diffident, suspicious yet simple, husband very well. Kay Kay Menon shines as Veena's friend - he does a great job as the free spirited slick Akash. The best part of the film is the down to earth locale of the city of Lucknow. The University, Hazratganj, the residential colonies, the teeming traffic - this is a slice of ordinary life rarely seen in films. Music is divine - I will have to watch out for more music by Sanjay Jaipurwale. The outstanding numbers are the Ghazal 'Guncha Koi Mere Naam Kar Diya, Saki Ne Phir Se Mera Jaam Bhar Diya', and 'Doob Jaana Re".Watch it if you want to see an authentic setting framing a great story about real people. You will not be disappointed!" 
" Enough of escapism cinema - here's simplicity at its realistic best!","In the era of escapist cinema, a film about the trials of a common man is like a whiff of fresh air. The movie largely relies on its simplicity which the audience instantly connects with. All the more if the protagonist is an overbearing and possessive husband it adds a different layer into the story.Rajpal Yadav:: Seriously nobody else could have reprised this role more effectively. In the early years, perhaps the role could be equated to Amol Palekar or Farooq Sheikh. The way he portrays his low self-esteem is indeed commendable. Rituparna Sengupta:: She carries herself with so much grace and beauty that you develop an instant liking for her. No wonder the husband becomes protective of this beauty. Pity, she couldn't capitalise on the success of this film and move forward in Bollywood.Kay Kay:: This powerhouse of talent needs no words to describe his performance. Simply, spot on.Varun Badola and Vinod Nagpal:: Nice to see TV artists on big frame. Performance-wise, quite adequate.Special mention about the "Guncha" song by Mohit Chauhan. Very soothing, yet soulful lyrics.Ideally, this movie could be termed as a ode' to Basu Chatterjee's and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's body of work.Finally, Chandan Arora deserves a pat on his back. Pity, there has been no significant news in terms of his directorial ventures." 
" What Happens When Your Wife Attracts More Attention Than You?","That's not exactly what 'Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh' is asking but it's more or less what a young insecure librarian, Mithilesh Shukla ruminates. 'Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh' is a charming little movie. What really appealed to me about it is the way the comedy and drama have been intertwined and yet it manages to remain real, simple and down to earth without being over the top or sugarcoated. It really indicates how many young men with low self esteem (especially those insecure about their physical features) perceive themselves and people in their surroundings.Rajpal Yadav fits Mithilesh Shukla like a glove. He delivers a very sincere performance. We see the film from his point of view. But, as a result of this the two other main characters suffer (because we don't know much about them). I would have liked to see more of Akash and Veena. The luminous Rituparna Sengupta is a complete delight to watch and she obviously chose a good film as a comeback to Hindi cinema. Kay Kay Menon is excellent as always, even in his brief role.The songs are relegated to the background and flow well with the screenplay. Lucknow is filmed beautifully. Thanks to Chandan Arora and Ashok Khanna for telling us this story in a simple (but not boring), sweet (but not sugary) and real (but not documentary) way. A must watch especially for those looking for something a fun and a little deep but not overwhelming." 
" A Must Watch Movie","This is one of the best movie i have seen where every character was looking so perfect.MAIN MERI PATNI AUR WOH tells the story of a bachelor, Mithilesh (Rajpal Yadav), a librarian with the University of Lucknow, who does not want to be bound by marriage. But he succumbs to family pressure and agrees to see a girl in Bareilly. Thus, Mithilesh comes face to face with Veena (Rituparna Sengupta).Mithilesh finds himself captivated by the pretty, charming and educated Veena, who is a few inches taller than him. Surprisingly, Veena gives the nod and consents to the marriage. Mithilesh is thrilled, so is his family.But there's trouble in paradise! Every compliment paid to his wife and every interaction of his wife with any male begin to haunt Mithilesh and remind him more and more about his lack of height and ordinary looks and his wife's beauty and charm.Mithilesh now finds himself trying to outdo or at least outsmart every potential competitor right from his milkman to his best friend Salim (Varun Badola) and even the local rickshaw driver Hussain. He even gets into an argument with a vegetable vendor when he offers tomatoes at any price that Veena will decide.At this juncture, walks in Akash (Kay Kay Menon), who is everything that Mithilesh aspires to be -- tall, smart, a complete liveware. Akash and Veena are friends and they enjoy each other's company. And Mithilesh finds himself to be a stranger when the two get together. Mithilesh's inferiority complex start troubling him and he starts reading books, goes for exercises, even visits a local quack to increase his height. If that isn't enough, he learns to even drink and smoke like Akash. Finally, Mithilesh decides Veena deserves someone like Akash, someone definitely better than him. And from hereon, life takes a twist for this young man! MAIN MERI PATNI AUR WOH could've been one enjoyable ride, but after a promising start, you suddenly realize that the vehicle has run out of gas. Just about everything is well laid out in the first hour itself, right from Rajpal's first meeting with Rituparna to the reasons that instill an inferiority complex in him.One reason why MAIN MERI PATNI AUR WOH works is because the actors are all perfect for their chosen parts.Rajpal Yadav contributes enormously so was Rituparna Sengupta looking beautiful and gorgeous.Kay Kay is a great actor but had very Little role in this film. Varun Badola is another bright actor who deserves to be seen more in films. All in All a must watch family film." 
" Simple story about the complexes in a simple mind","The director does a good job of exploring and bringing out the insecurities of a simple, very plain-looking middle class man who somehow lands a gorgeous woman for a wife. He's constantly reminded of his shortcomings (pun unintended :) and lack of charisma in innocent, everyday incidents. The movie delves into the depths of his complexes, which grow with time, consuming him completely. Yet those complexes are so very real, experienced by each one of us everywhere in our own lives.The one not so real aspect was the wife's sweet innocence throughout the story. Unlike real women, she never once compares him to other men (which of course would have proved his complexes to be well-founded)! The movie thankfully does not have the Bollywood signature of clichéd dialogues and exaggerated, melodramatic acting and direction. That makes it watchable. Rajpal Yadav is very talented, and does a great job of portraying a man aware of his inadequacies. Rituparna did good justice to her character, which unfortunately lacked depth and realism. K K Menon was a superb choice for the charming and suave friend of the wife who unconciously overshadows her husband in everything." 
" A Simple Movie with so many messages","This is a movie that one should definitely watch. Everyone of us try to be simple and nice to the people. However as we interact with people, we start making comparison and living in perception. Most of the time we hurt ourselves only by doing this. The movie revolves around this perception and how one believe leads to another. The script and story are simple and close to reality. A Very Good Movie with many messages.This is a movie that one should definitely watch. Everyone of us try to be simple and nice to the people.

" An Excel in its own!","This is one of those films, which u expect to be another same ol same ol sort of stuff. So did I, when I first saw the trailers. I did not watch the movie in the theater something which I immensely regret now instead I watched it one fine night on the television with the commercials. And believe me when I say this, it will not disappoint you. Mithilesh Shukla is a shy, introvert man who stays in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. A librarian who is afraid of getting married, presumably in fear of rejection. His mama uncle, on his melodramatic mother's influence takes him forcibly to meet a 30 yr old girl Rituparna Ghosh in Bareily a night's bus ride from Lucknow. Mithilesh falls in what we call LOVE-AT FIRST-SIGHT, but he himself is pretty sure the girl Veena wont accept him. But she does. So they get married to live happily ever after. bRRRRakes..! Not yet,not yet! Soon after marriage Mithilesh's insecurities starts cropping up. He suspects everyone wants to court his wife, from the milkman to the grocery man to his best friend Salim. He takes every precaution to keep his Wife away from them. He even arranges a Rakhi-tie for Salim and his wife. But then enters Kay Kay Menon, Veena's old school friend who Mithilesh thinks is way above himself as a persona. What happens from here on is for you to watch.Everything about this film is fresh and it has great charm about it. To start with, Naseeruddin Shah voice-over about Lucknow and Mithilesh or Mithilesh's family. The actors are fabulous.A special mention for Vinod Nagpal as Mamaji and Rituparna Sengupta as Veena. But Rajpal Yadav is the show-stealer. The sets are real, all of them which gives the film a real feeling. There is a Dhaba scene at night which was beautifully shot. Or those moments of anxiety when Mithilesh is about to meet Veena. The locations are amazing. NO Switzerlandbut Lucknow has been captured beautifully so has Bareily. I can go on and on.Thank You Chandan Arora for making such a wonderful film possible.

" So much more than just a movie","I created an IMDb account today just to write about this movie."Why!",did you ask?"Because this brilliant vignette has drawn me closest to feeling compelled to write about primal human emotions - apprehension, excitement, love, contentment, suspicion, tragedy and redemption." This is not just a movie. It is a supreme portrayal of realistic, candid emotions displayed with panache, which will leave your heart overcome with satisfaction and warmth, your fingers running through your silky hairs in a spate of incredulity, as your mind tries to assimilate the flashflood of an unusually rich emotional experience, and your lips glistening with a glint of subdued smile. You will not want to disclose your happiness to everyone - some might be suspicious why your face looks so radiant and your eyes look so overwhelmed even one week after you watched that movie. That's right - it's not one of the movies which you watch, feel good for few hours, and then forget. The experience is a persistent one, which will linger on for a long long time.The ensemble of artists is not very starry, but the performances delivered by each one of them is perhaps one of the best one can find in this medium of art. The characters are very commonplace and hence easy to relate to; I think the strength of the story lies in its pragmatism and the prudence of its portrayal thereof. Moreover, nothing in this movie is a filler. Nothing. Every frame, every song has been put there for a reason. And believe you me, the songs are just awesome. So that's it. I have loved this movie each of the 10+ times I have watched it. And I have listened to its songs to cheer myself up from gloom, solitude and despair. But you have to watch the movie to appreciate the depth of the songs, and to appreciate the depth of relationships. Plus, let me tell you this - if you are less than 5'7'' (like me),and a bachelor(like me), you will LOVE the movie even more.Remember, its not just a movie. It's so much more !! Enjoy all of it." 
" Bravo. Well done.","This is one movie that simply touches you and leaves a pleasant after taste. This is one wine that lingers on and on any one would beg for more (I would).Set in a middle class environment, the story revolves around a short man and tall woman. The lady is a stunning beauty and the man is just average and some how get married.The trouble starts when man gets a bit jealous and perhaps suspicious because his good looking lady is a constant object of attraction for others. Sometimes this is hilarious.Either way, this all leads to some serious misunderstandings but the movie comes to a graceful end that will go through the throat." 
" Safe for everyone to watch.---Maharishi Verma","Wow! This is called a movie.Director Chan Dan Arora's Main Meri Patni Aur Woh (Me,My wife,and Him)has all qualities of a good cinema,because handles the simple story very well ,but it's the narrative style that works.The simplicity of his film is another plus point.There is no action or visual effects, which are not enough to save a poor film,but the performances of lead actors will surely wins you over.This is the story of Mithilesh Shukla a short but good-hearted person,Who is married with Veena a tall educated woman but the problem starts when she is getting so much attention than his husband,which is not liked by Mithilesh.The story is simple but the way of the narration is different. Rajpal Yadav is likable as Mithilesh Shukla, Rituparna Sengupta's performance is above average.Kay Kay Menon does his job well.The movie is set in Lucknow, U.P( Which is my home city).And for my surprise the songs are better than I expected,doob jaana and chand varga are hummable tracks.This is one my favorite films and i recommend it to you believe me it will not let you down. Ratings--9/10 Read my other reviews." 
" Simple and touching","The story is based on a very simple premise. The director has done a good job at slowly unfolding the emotional mire that the lead character (played by Rajpal Yadav) goes through. At the outset, it is about the inferior feeling experienced by Rajpal Yadav due to his short stature, however, it can be just as applicable to many of us, just height getting replaced by something else we are too conscious about. Rajpal Yadav has delivered a great performance. Rest of the cast has done a fine job. The later part of the second half could be improved. Overall, well made and thought provoking, not for someone looking for the typical masala movie."
