" A sea of emotions","I had read somewhere that being in love with someone is a great thing because it makes you feel alive. Joggers Park confirms the statement. It is not about the Joggers' Park situated in Bandra West, Mumbai. It is about two joggers who come to know each other by meeting there and the life changes for both of them.There is an old Hindi movie song whose one stanza says - NA UMR KI SEEMA HO, NA JANM KA HO BANDHAN, JAB PYAR KARE KOI TO DEKHE KEWAL MANN (In love, there is no bar of age or birth as a lover sees only the heart of the beloved). And Joggers Park is a beautifully told saga which underscores this saying in a highly emphatic manner.A retired judge comes across a working girl, half his age in the Joggers Park. The girl is outspoken, lovely, confident and emotional. Interacting with her leads the aged man of principals who is a stern patriarch in his family, to have the feeling of the melting of the paraffin. A whole new world of emotions, interactions and social life opens before the aged gentleman who has never happened to see anything outside the court-room, the legal files and his traditional joint family. The girl, on the other hand, too gets more and more fascinated to the mature and benevolent nice person who sometimes becomes possessive towards her like a kid. However, ultimately both come to realise that this relationship, howsoever satisfying it might be, has not future and the society will not allow it to be made public. On the girl's side, the need of social security gets the better of her love and on the male's side, his responsibility towards his family overpowers his deep and delicate sentiments towards the girl. But the touchy last scene of the movie reminds the viewer that the thread of love cannot be broken by distance of the involving individuals.The d√©butant director late Mr. Anant Balani has done a terrific job. He has handled the sensitive and delicate theme of the movie with utmost maturity. The film has its flaws and lean patches, yet the overall impact of the movie upon a sensitive viewer is nothing short of a marvel. The biggest plus point, in my opinion, of the movie is that while treating the plot, the director has lent utmost respect to the central characters. Whether or not, you approve the relationship between the lead pair, you cannot help yourself respecting them. They are never short of dignity. The supporting cast has also been shown in respectful light and the story teller is very much correct in not exposing the scandalous affair and giving a different and highly mature end to the story.The characters are purely the flesh and blood human-beings. Nobody appears to be a fake character. Every main sequence of the movie has a human face. The human side of the two protagonists as well as the family members of the judge is revealed and emphasized with elegance. After all, loving somebody is not a sin and all emotional male-female relationships are not destined for the wedlock. But then, does this fact reduce the importance of the relationship or the sentiments involved ? No ! Declares the story teller. The relationship between the loving couple has been shown as purely platonic. They enjoy each-other's company, they respect each-other, they care for each-other and they strive to see and listen to each-other. But ! Nowhere is there any element of sensuality. And that shows the director's better sense and mature handling of a love story of a 65 years' old retired judge and a 32 years' old working girl.The musical score is pretty good though repeating the Adnan Saami song again and again in the background, irritates. The ghazal of Jagjeet Singh - Badi Najuk Hai Yeh Manzil is nothing short of a treat for the melody lovers. The cinematography is good. The loving couple is seen several times near the sea which (perhaps) symbolises the depth of their relationship. Other technical aspects are also upto the mark. The movie is lengthy but it is not a minus point because to portray the evolution of the relationship properly, the narrator needed time.The lead pair has delivered towering performances. Victor Banerjee has not done many Hindi films but he an actor of the genre of Nasiruddin Shah, Girish Karnad and Om Puri and since his early days of Shyam Benegal's Kalyug in 1981, he has seldom disappointed with his performance. The kid like feeling and behaviour of Justice J.P. Chatterjee who is in his sixties, has been excellently portrayed by him, giving the relevant scenes of the movie, an utterly human look. Perizaad Zorabian, on the other hand is not only pretty but a highly efficient actress who has portrayed the sentimental but daring and confident Jennie so well that it is difficult to imagine any other actress in that role. Among other cast which has got cameos only, Divya Dutta as the straight-talking and mirror showing daughter and Abha Dhuliya as the completely traditional and never suspecting her husband, devoted housewife are excellent.Why do we use the term - falling in love ? Falling itself is a negative term. In love, a person rises, not falls. Even when you are already committed, being in love with someone does not make you a sinner. After all, love just happens. It is not something deliberately attempted. The thing that constrains the expression and advancement of such feelings is called MARYAADA or the behavioural boundary-line associated to a person's status in the social life. Indian culture and the Indian social set-up put family honour and social repute of an individual on top of his priority list. And love is meant for sacrifice. Isn't it ? See Joggers Park and realise yourself." 
" An enjoyable movie","I always look forward to watching Bollywood movies, especially ones that are different than the norm.  In this movie we see the relationship evolve between a married, well-renowned, retired judge and an independent 30-something woman.  Both Perizaad Zorabian and Victor Banerjee were good in their roles, but Perizaad was especially very good in her role as the bubbly independent woman, Jenny.  She really stood out as an incredible performer and she will be someone to watch out for in her future roles.   I watched the movie twice just because I enjoyed her peformance so much.  For music lovers, the Saigal re-mix and the tracks by Adnan Sami and Jagjit Singh are particularly memorable.This movie wasn't preachy as it shows the dilemma faced by a man who is married and has grown-up children.  From one perspective the burst of energy that Jenny infuses in the judge's life makes one think that he shouldn't forsake Jenny's love for family honour, but on the other hand he would be hurting not only his family but also Jenny.  So watch Jogger's Park to see whom he chooses!" 
" A nice and simple story","Jogger's Park is a movie about Love, about friendship, about a young woman's fight for survival in a big city like Mumbai, about a retired judge.Jogger's park is a matured love story. A love story between a retired person and a 30 something woman. The movie is funny, simple, & honest to its story.The movie is shot in Jogger's Park which is actually a park located in Bandra West in Mumbai. The movie is about the feeling a retired judge develops for a single woman staying all alone. A woman who is different from the rest of the world. She stays all alone in mumbai to fight for her bread & butter. JC a retired judge has worked for forty years before retiring and realizes his life was all work and no play. He decides to do something different when his kids suggest him to go for jogging in Jogger's Park. There he meets this damsel Jenny who is a freelance worker in Mumbai. Jenny's entry brings a radical change in his life and they develop feelings for each other. But then he is scared of the society.Then something happens which changes his world. Both Perizad & Victor Banerji have acted well & fit to the role perfectly. Subash Ghai has chosen a very nice story to tell. Beautiful scenes from various parts of Mumbai have been presented in the movie.In short, movie will make a good watch." 
" Decent film with a a twist","There have been several films made on elderly man falling for young girls, In fact it was adressed in different forms like in a form of a comedy like SHAUKEEN or a satire. However rarely films see the mature side. There have been even sex related films like Ek chotisi love story. This film is more on mature side and takes look at issues in a mature manner, the romance isn't sex laden but more on pure love. The film has several great moments and it's well handled. Though certain subplots could be better like the Hiten track and the other lover part.Direction is good Music is decent, Ishq Hota Nahin is a good song used throughout rest are goodVictor Banerjee is superb in his role, Perizaad too is awesome Hiten Tejwani is decent, Divya Dutta stands out as usual, rest are all good" 
" Brilliant performances and a Good movie.","It is a very good movie. Victor Banerjee, Perizaad Zorabian, Divya Dutta and others were all very good. This is a tasteful treat, no melodrama, no junk, just a clean tasteful movie which is very well directed. Screenplay is good and the performances make each character so believable. Perizaad is half of Victor's age, but they both fall for each other. Or as they say in the movie "You don't fall but rise in love". This can happen to anyone. This is something so natural, and the Director and Story writer have beautifully handled something so delicate. In a normal case, I would have hated Victor's character for cheating on his wife, but at no point in the movie did I feel even slightly upset with him. Its a very good movie."
