" As the film is based on FACEBOOK relationships, so here I press the LIKE button.","Taking forward the new genre of "Youthful Movies" in Bollywood, here is a film which is a delightful watch with some sparkling performances full of energy and style. Intelligently made within a short duration of around 100 minutes, the film starts off in flying colours justifying its trendy name in a spirited style and then keeps on entertaining you mostly till the end. The Facebook generation should appreciate the attempt as it is just made for them specifically and captures the young mindset almost perfectly.The production house has planned its project well with an all fresh talented star-cast, a debutant but famous music director and a small budget film shot in its limited locations. The dialogues are sharp and entertaining, the sequences are pretty engaging and momentum keeps on going with very few dipping scenes (in its second half). Actually what really works in the film is the chemistry between its four key characters which never becomes heavy or goes over the top. So the film is quite balanced in that direction.Both Saqib Saleem (Vishal) & Saba Azad (Preity), excel in their respective characters and win your heart straight away. In fact Preity earlier also impressed a lot in her short cameo in DIL KABADDI. Nishant Dahiya (Rahul) & Tara D'Souza (Malvika) support them superbly with their good looks and keep the spirit alive. The actors playing the naughty friends of Saqib successfully bring few laughs in the theater especially in the opening sequence inspired from the famous American PIE series of the West.Musically, the film gets an energetic score from Raghu Dixit, with songs looking fine while you are watching them but still I felt their melody part could have been better. Overall the film gives you a good time in the theater mainly because of its performances and strictly not anything else.But here is my "Million Dollar Question" to the director Nupur Asthana and the writers of the film : "When everything was so perfectly and easily available to you right at your doorstep, then Why on earth did you choose such a rotten an overused story-plot for your film, which the viewers have already seen so many times before on the screen?"Speaking the truth, the makers very ridiculously choose the same old plot of disguised identities over the net in their film, reminding you of 'YOU'VE GOT MAIL' and many other similar movies in which the lead couple keeps chatting with each other on a site, posing as someone else. Regrettably this becomes the main drawback of the film making it entirely predictable right from the introduction of the Social Networking Site, FACEBOOK in one of its initial scenes. But luckily the execution of the plot and the talented bunch of actors save the film from being just another version of the ages old plot and the viewers keep on enjoying it despite the fact that they already know, what's going to happen next.However the fact remains that if only the makers had thought of a new & unexplored plot for their present well directed attempt then it could have been a big HIT of the season indisputably. Yet, do watch it if you are young or young at heart and love the Facebook mania, currently the in-thing all over the world." 
" Bad title for a good movie","My room-mate insisted and as earlier I made him see movies that I like I had to go this time with him. So, there I was at Cinemax, wonder mall @10.30PM last night with a disgust in my mind and little hope that I would like this movie. The scary thought was that the movie had songs!!!Let me analyze the movie first and would provide my verdict at the end.Theme: The story is set in fashion technology college. Vishal and Rahul are friends and Malavika and Preity are friends. Vishal take the identity of Rahul in facebook and similar happened with Preity. They chat, impress each other and fall in love. The catch here is that in real life Vishal and Preity can't tolerate each other. One minute with each other would translate into a fight. Well, a known premise with predictable twists and climax. Concept matches (very slight and I'm just nitpicking) with "10 things I hate about you" and "You've got mail".Character development : The main assets of the movie are its vibrant characters. They are young, enthusiastic and bring the energy on screen. From start importance is given to main leads though you never get the feeling that some odd boys and girls are playing the part of being their friends only. Direction : Crisp, smart and shiny (why did I use 'shiny' I don't know. It just felt right). Apart from the climax scene never I found the direction is out of control. The direction really helped developing the characters more. Good job there director sir!Screenplay: The concept is old, tried and tested. Making a movie at this time based on an old concept and drawing audience to it is not easy. It has no big stars, not much promotions, and bad songs...and a worst title ever. So, it had to had something right for it to survive. Screenplay and dialog writing are the two strong pillars that it depends on. Screenplay is smart and you could relate to the story without feeling out of place. And dialogs are a real gem of the movie. When is the last time you've heard in a movie where two girls chatting and one jokingly says to other "sada boyfriendbati bhabo"!!! If anyone of you had watched it...I'm not aware of ur opinion but I liked the dialogs. They are the reason the movie could be a hit (or should be)(well, there are few moments when its tacky and too predictable twists. I agree those are weak points but its like riding a faulty Mercedes. The ride is smooth and comforting but the engine stops working sometimes but for very short time)Acting: The two main protagonists play their part very well. Its a treat to watch them fight or pulling each others leg. Apart from few scenes it never felt that they are acting in a movie. Apart from the main lead..the other important and unavoidable characters are their friends. All characters are drawn very wellCinematography: I'm not sure about cinematography. No extra effort there. Nothing exceptional there that I could mention in a review.Background scores and songs: I did not like the songs. Period.Editing: Editing is good. Never felt the movie was stretched beyond its limit.Overall entertainment value: I liked the movie. Maybe I went with a negative expectation (not even zero) It surprised me more. i did not expect it to be such smart, hip or light. It did not bore me (well a few moments though). If not in a cinema theater...a DVD watch is must. Verdict: Like most of you even I had disliked the movie the moment I heard the name. What kind of looser keeps a name like that! That was the only repulsive factor which discouraged me to even pay attention to its trailers. I'm happy that I knew nothing about the movie and that can be one of the many reasons I liked it more. The movie is funny, light, smart and entertaining. A perfect movie to catch on a lazy afternoon with your friends." 
" A Terrific Entertainer!","'Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge' is a terrific entertainer, that is refreshing, crisp & very arresting. The script is water-tight and very youthful, while the direction & the performances, are simply superb. It's a winner!'Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge' Synopsis: Two incompatible collegians, with fake social network ids, are assigned to work together for their institute's annual celebrations.'Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge' is youthful & crisp. The Screenplay is water-tight and very fast. Also, the characters, all of them, are very interesting & appealing. Nupur Ashtana's Direction is superb. She has handled the film very well. Cinematography is eye-filling. Editing is good. Music by Raghu Dixit, is peppy. Performance-Wise: Debutant Saqib Saleem does remarkably well. This guy has the energy & the potential that one asks in a Star. Saba Azad is lovable and suits the character perfectly. Also, The On-Screen chemistry between Saleem-Azad, is vibrant all through. Nishant Dahiya is passable. Tara D'Souza looks gorgeous and scores as well. Prabal Panjabi is average. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge' is a winner all the way. Go for it!" 
" A feel-good movie for me.","Of course, it doesn't deserve a 9 star rating, but for me it does." 
" Quite A Movie","I really loved this Movie. This is the movie that I will never grow tired of watching. If you fond of Hindi movie then you must watch it :) This is not just a saying. it is true.people do not like to watch Hindi movie or people do not enjoy watching love story will definitely like this movie. I checked it with some of my friends who hardly watch Hindi movies. But after forcing them watching this movie no one denied it as a good film. that was quite an achievement for me :)If you have time for watching a Hindi movie. before trying anything else you should watch this one. i assure you that you will not be disappointed." 
" good chick flick","In the sixties , movies used to show actors in their thirties pretending to be students in college . Now seventeen year olds are shown pretending to be 21 year olds in college courtesy Yash raj films .......All to enjoy the freedom of boozing and doing the things that adults do--yeah , even the girls !!And the new vehicle for starting romance is the internet ; more specifically , the star of the net--facebook , what else.....Yeah , forget dating sites and all that , these college kids are hooked on to facebook for finding a partner.....So whats the story ??A goodlooking girl and a goodlooking guy use the profiles of an even better looking girl and better looking guy to chat with each other......for they are not so confident about their real self .As they begin to like each other , they want to meet . But both don't know who they are chatting to , and send the real persons of the profiles to meet each other .So there are four people in the ring--the two real people whose profiles are being used , and the two fakes who are using the profiles to chat with each other .But who is in love with whom ??They all themselves are confused about that , because the fakes like each other on the net , but don't like each other in real life.....So how will romance blossom , and between whom and whom ??But don't worry ; as the cliché goes--love will find a way.....But until its finds a way , there is some fun , some college dhammal , some entertainment , some partying , some college pranks to be pulled......All candyfloss stuff for the bubblegum crowd......So go have fun !!Verdict--watchable ." 
" Fantaaaastic movie!! :-)","This is the first Indian movie I've ever seen, and I've got to say: I'm IMPRESSED!! I'm looking forward to more movies like this! This isn't like the average "chick flick" that comes to mind, ya know...girl seeks "popular hot" boy, girl somehow gets "popular hot" boy (even through all the crazy things she does), this movie is REALISTIC and portrays how even for EXTREME hating-each-other's-guts opposites Vishal and Preity, there is STILL a thin line between hate and love. Unlike most high-budget Hollywood movies, this movie does a WELL-BETTER job of exploring that (which surprises me why movies like this one don't get recognized like they SHOULD), and let's face it, the songs are simply CATCHY! Good choreography and singing! Have I mentioned it's funny?!? Gotta love the supporting roles and all the silly things Vishal and Preity do to pretend to be Rahul (Vishal) and Malvika (Preity)! And simply the movie overall, I can't find the exact words to define it, but 'tis simply FRESH! While it surely follows a common plot (starting a relationship not face-to-face, as seen in "Catfish" and "You've Got Mail"), "Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge" gives the concept it's little spin, as Rahul and Preity, who hated each other with a disturbing passion, are able to look past their differences and things they hated about each other and find things that made Preity and Rahul love each other.To simplify it, this movie shows (through it's vivid acting, quality, originality and thought) that love, a beautiful thing, can make you laugh, smile, be happy...even if it's with that one person you thought you hated but once you found love you realized you could turn your differences away and into a beautiful thing. Heart it!" 
" Do you wanna make fraandship!","I thought this was an exemplary effort. From the very start to the montage in the end, this was some imagination at work. Relatively simple case of complicated online identities and adolescent issues, but the sharp dialogues and the leading couple take it a notch up from being a normal college flick. Some of the lines absolutely cracked me up! What works even more - the hero's sidekick...the drag sequence was hilarious. What doesn't work - the other couple, who could jarr at times.Kudos to Yash Raj for moving away from run of the mill again. Go ahead watch this on a Sunday evening, time well spent." 
" Youthful romantic comedy with a silly title !!","This movie from the Yash raj films youth banner is relatively fast paced and enjoyable and is worth watching once. In fact the silly title actually takes a bit of sheen away from a well placed and youthful romantic comedy.In my opinion, the script has similarities to Hollywood flick 'The truth about cats & dogs'. Its a love story set in the milieu of the social networking sites that have gone on to take over the world. A simple story of mistaken identities and The lead pair perform really well and fit in effortlessly into their respective character's skins. Saba Azad is quite delightful as Preity. She had already impressed me earlier as the object of Rahul Bose's infatuation in Dil Kabaddi. Saqib Saleem is a new kid on the block and has acted quite naturally in the movie. In fact, the only scene where i felt the director and the lead pair was not convincing was the climax scene.Supporting actors were competent in their roles but no one really stood out for me except for the lead pair.Y Films which are an off shoot of the Yashraj banner seem to be the banner from which they'll bring out their youth oriented movies and if this is movie is any indication of their future output then we can expect some fresh films to be released soon. P.S. - i really love the Y-Films logo and the intro clip."
