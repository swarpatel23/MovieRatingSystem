" An endearing experience","No high drama, no pubescent hysteria, no artifice,Yes, Bubble Gum is a sweet and sensitive ode to growing up in an age when there was no Facebook, no internet and no mobiles. Then, in small town India, teen love stories were made up of cycle chases, where young boys furiously followed their girl friends and tried desperately to muster up courage to make the first move. Fourteen-year-old Vedant's love story with Jenny, the local cop's daughter has such an innocence and angst to it, it brings a smile to your lips. Specially when there emerges Ratan, a brash and bold young rival in love who insists in stealing Jenny away with his relentless gifts of mint cigarettes and bubble gums. This teenage love story works only because it has such an authentic feel to it and is poles apart from the run-of-the mill teen romances that spill over from Bollywood's assembly line.But more than all this, Bubble Gum is a moving film on parenting, specially in a case where one of the kids is physically challenged. Both Tanvi Azmi and Sachin Khedekar create picture perfect monographs of parents who try to cope with the highs and lows of creating a harmonious balance between their two kids. In a telling sequence, dad Khedekar asks wife Tanvi who is the real handicapped kid: robust, restless, angst-ridden Vedant or hearing-impaired and mature Vidur? Bubble Gum beautifully showcases young Vedant's envy, frustration and anger at the special attention his brother gets and resents the fact that his parents insist he includes his brother in his group of friends. Needless to say, the love between the brothers is unquestionable but the mood swings, the tantrums and the squabbles are equally realistic too.BUBBLE GUM is a refreshing, heart-warming tale that makes us nostalgic of the good old days. This 'Bubble Gum' must be blown! A must watch" 
" One of the most authentic films that captures the innocence and vulnerability of being a teenager","First of all, don't be mislead by the title. I too was under the impression that this would be a sugarfluff teen romance but trust me when I say that most of you won't want to miss this.It's been a long time since I've watched an authentic slice of life film (from Hindi cinema) that really captures what it was like to be a teenager. Most of the film is seen through 14 year old Vedant's point of view. Sanjivan Lal's film is very detailed and he pretty much captures every essence and innocence of what it was like growing up in a Southeast Asian community in the 80s. The references to pop-culture of that time are entertaining.The art direction, costumes, makeup and sets really capture the feeling of the 80s before the digital age (when there wasn't an abundance of mobile phones, computers and compact discs). There's some fine camera-work and editing. It's not overtly stylized but just good enough to not distract the viewer from the story.As well-made as it is on the technical side, the strongest highlight of 'Bubble Gum' is how the director and writer bring their vision to screen and the actors' performances. I'm glad to see Tanvi Azmi get fine roles in great movies again. She is one criminally underrated actress and here she is excellent as the loving mother trying to maintain the balance in the family. Sachin Khedekar is dependable as usual and is nothing short of wonderful.The two newcomers, Delzad Hiwale and Sohail Lakhani, who play brothers Vedant and Vidhur, deserve top most praise. They play their parts with full conviction delivering such natural performances that at times, it's easy to forget that you're watching actors. I hope this unpredictable world of cinema gives these two young actors the opportunity to have a shining career and that they continue to do fine work.'Bubble Gum' holds nostalgic value for me. I can really relate to the story. Sanjivan Lal's sincerity shines. I wish more movies like this gained enough recognition and continue to be made. By the end I was wearing a great big smile on my face. I couldn't recommend this precious little gem enough and I'll surely be revisiting it soon." 
" A brilliant flawless movie ...............","Well what can i say about this movie.....i won't have words to express my gratitude towards the whole team who did a superb job in making such a colorful movie which touches heart every time i watched it...all characters were so realistic that i went into my childhood days when I loved chewing Boomer and Big babol ....so nostalgic.....I liked all characters but rattan and Vidur were amazing.....But its an irony such movie who have no big names wont be able to make an impact on Box office...What happens to bolywood these days making some nonsense movies and if a director not so much famous makes a decent attempt nobody prefer to watch their movies Love u bubble gum and heartily thanks 4 being such a sweet movie...MUAHH" 
" Something everyone can relate to","Let me just start out by saying THANK YOU Bollywood for making a great film in this age of one trash after another.With that being said, I wouldn't be lying if I said everyone who grew up in the 80s or 90s or even before that would find something to relate to in this movie. It has so many nostalgic moments, from chewing bubblegum to street fights to love letters to secretive romance.I could really relate to a lot of things in the movie so I was really attached to many details in it. This was also made possible with the aid of great writing and excellent acting.This is NOT a romantic movie, so don't go in there expecting lots of romance, romantic dialogues, lines, etc. Its a journey of a young boy from feeling abandoned and being naive to being mature and feeling loved. If you liked "Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander", you will love this movie. Give it a shot!" 
" A Low profile movie on teenage..... plain, sincere, and commendable.....",""Bubble Gum" looks more like a TV Movie without big stars, sets, posh costumes, or lavish song numbers. What it does is a plain story telling, based on a nice subject. It's a teenage drama dealing with the anger, frustration,bonding, attraction to opposite sex that starts to grow during teenage and gives a nice message to the parents on understanding the changes and aspirations that take place in them. Such a nice theme somewhat is wrapped in a very plain film that lacks much of shades and situations in drama. There is not much to endear in the story nor the story looks very well narrated, which makes the film forgettable. Despite the low profile and the plainness of the film, the performances of the children and Sachin Khadekar and Tanvi Azmi as parents are commendable.Rating: 1 star out of 4" 
" Splendid Movie","Well i am speechless.... Nothing to say about this movie. Really splendid work done, it makes me nostalgic each and every time i watched it.Really i cried, when i watched this movie first time.I sometimes feels the characters in the movie are same like me or they are pretty close to my heart.Why these type of movies are not getting so much public support or advertisement.Hats Off to the Team..... Thank u.. and pl do make some more movies like this." 
" Brilliant and Unforgettable","This is one of the most underrated movies of Indian Cinema. Flawless, beautiful and light movie." 
" Brilliant","what a beautiful movie this is... one of the movies one can watch over and over again. The way it shows how 2 brothers bond over few days, holi festival and some arguments is just brilliant. Do not underestimate the magnificence of this movie by judging it by its star-cast. Believe me, those child artists and other actors like Sachin Khedekar, as the father of a deaf and mute child and another vulnerable teenager, deliver way more than some of our beloved superstars have ever had. The story is set in an era when there was no facebook, no mobiles and no other way to communicate to a girl than sending a letter. Set in 80's, it is about the difficulties an average teenager faces, which goes parallel with the story between those two brothers and how the elder one befriends and helps the younger with his problems.Do watch this movie for the elegance it has."
