" Sanjay Dutt Rocks!","Yes, this is a remake of John Q. Yes, you cannot help compare to Denzel. However, this is a definite top 10 movies of Sanjay Dutt. He has given solid performance. He is on top of his game in this movie. You cannot help but be involved. I have seen John Q and was wondering if it will be a waste of time. However, as movie progressed Sanjay has really made it worth the watch (both time and money!). Recently there has been a string on nonsense movies coming. So I was impressed. However the plot is bit radical especially a made for Indian audience ending. However, I don't think this is anyone else but Sanjay's movie! I just hope the choice of actors were better. Amisha is not suited for the role at all. I think Antra would have done better. Amisha was not able to bring or compliment the emotions needed. Even her make up was not suited for the role. She is pretty dumb to adapt to roles. I saw her teesri aankh. Even there she was lame. For her role she should have made an attempt to learn the sign language. So in this respect this was a half hearted attempt by the director and producer. I don't think failure of movie can be blamed at Sanjay. At best he is the only asset to the movie." 
" a bad remake of Denzel Washingtons's John Q","Expecting a good movie after having such a strong script like John Q and the director of Dus,was very disappointed.Average acting .Only one song ,which thankfully lessens the length of the film.Amisha Patel is a big joke in such a intense movie.Well best watched on DVD if you have the time and are a sanjay dutt fan.I would recommend watching the original John Q on DVD if you can,as it shows one of Denzels best roles.The plot on paper sounds very interesting ,how a man takes people hostage ,to save his son who needs a heart transplant and does not have the money to pay for his operation.The director should have worked harder on the screenplay and it had such an identifiable story line which if it had been made well ,could have been a good hit." 
" A Movie To Remember!","I first saw this movie en route to India on the plane. I sobbed & found it all very heart-wrenching & I couldn't wait to return to Toronto to get a copy. Here is a master at the height of his creative power and he is so believable as the father. The movie worked for me & I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is as good as John Q. and I think that it is fair in life to have a passionate man & a reserved woman as a couple. Long live Sanjay & may his troubles disappear like feathers in the wind.I am puzzled that some think that it was not an enjoyable film. I disagree entirely and I think that it is one of the best films that I have seen for a long time. My judgement of any film rests on this fact: Has the actor convinced me that this story is true? I was entirely caught up in the plot and believed every bit of the story and found myself sobbing as the story unfolded and I believed that my response could only have come about because of the wonderful acting from Sanjay. I believe that he was well supported by the others but maybe he is like a star that outshines everyone else. Is there a female who is his equal and will we see her teamed with him in another movie when his troubles are over? Magnificent actors can seldom find the right partner because they outshine everyone else." 
" Never push a father to the edge...","This adaptation of the 2002 Denzel Washington starrer 'John Q' stands above the average fare doled out in 2006. Tackling the serious issue of health care red tape, this movie has its moments. Ravi Rajput(Dutt) is a doting middle-class father of a cute 7 year old(Master Pathak).When the son takes ill in a heart complication, Ravi has to raise 15 lac rupees for the heart transplant operation in order to save his son's life. But due to callous hospital administration who want the money upfront and an uncaring health insurance company, Ravi has reached his wit's end. Ia a fit of rage, he takes the hospital under siege adamant to save his son's life. Will he succeed? Or will the machinations of bureaucracy destroy an innocent child's life? Without giving anything away, I will say that this movie manages to move you. Sanjay Dutt delivers a knockout performance-- a gritty and realistic portrayal of a simple, blue collar worker who loves his son very much; and will do anything to keep him alive. The supporting cast barring a terrible Amisha Patel as Ravi's wife is competent. Jaya Pradha in a fine comeback shows that she's indeed a capable performer. Gulshan Grover also does a good job as the DCP who has to take Ravi down. The music of the film is simple but powerful; and conveys the mood of the film very well. Director Anubhav Sinha leaves out the flashy technique and does a fine job letting the film flow. I wouldn't be surprised if Dutt is in the reckoning for a Best Actor statuette this year. He is entirely believable as the hapless father who's trapped in a situation he doesn't want,but is left with no choice.He has you rooting for his Ravi Rajput,even though you know that he has taken the law into his own hands. If you are fed up of the trash that's coming out in the name of cinema these days, rent 'Tathastu'. At just under 2 hours, it is strong enough to hold your attention for the entire duration and will not leave you disappointed. Highly recommended. 9 on 10." 
" John q in Hindi","Anubhav Sinha after the crap DUS returns with worse TATHASTU the film which could be realistic and brilliant ends up being a typical Hindi film The film is a copy of JOHN Q and repeats the mistakes too The reality goes out of the window when Sanju storms the hospital with a small gun and keeps the people on hostage what follows is an uninteresting regular film where we get to see other side character's turmoil, an ever long sermon by Manoj Pahwa and the same politician scamDirection by Anubhav Sinha is decent Camera-work is goodSanju excels in the scenes showing distress and lives up to his role but when he takes the gun in his hand, his characterization fails, he comes across more as a goon and bhai rather then a poor father and his act fails but yet a brilliant perf otherwise Amisha is bad, her crying scene is comical and annoying Gulshan grover is good jaya Pradha is adequate rest are okay" 
" A decent movie with decent performances","Well, I would say this movie is a sentimental one, but not like the sentiments in flicks of Shahrukh Khan. The movie is all Sanjay Dutt. Amisha Patel as usual doesn't have anything to do. Jayaprada makes a good comeback. The storyline is pretty decent. The movie is all about a simple minded lower middle class father who is ready to go any extent to save his ill son, whose treatment costs something he would never make out in his whole life ,1.5 million rupees. I feel my rating of 9 justified, coz, these days again the movies have started getting boring. And Sanjay Dutt has become more matured in his action as well as choice of movies. Critics may try to point out weaknesses in this movie, and yes there are many such as average screenplay, but ultimately the movie succeeds in making a good impact on us. We will feel satisfied after we watch this movie and will be happy for watching something like this." 
" Please don't watch this one","One of the most badly made movies. Apart from Sanjay Dutt everyone else overacted. Amisha Patel did'nt have an idea of what she was doing. Screenplay was very weak. I don't think so a director was required for this movie. Instead of wasting resources on such movies, it should have been used for better purposes. On the first day fourth show more than have the theater was empty. It is highly recommended to avoid this one.It is disappointing right from the beginning. there was'nt a single moment where the audience could enjoy, apart from laughing on the serious scenes.Audience which has paid for its admission has a right to demand for better stuff." 
" John Q?","What a crap movie. Ik bought this one only because I like Sanjay Dutt as an actor. This man can act any role, see Mission Kashmir and Munna Bhai. But in this movie he plays with one of the worst actresses in Bollywood, Amisha Patel and the little boy chubby boy what plays his son who could not act in Bhagban and who still cannot act in this movie.Thathastu is based on the Hollywood movie John Q with Denzel Washington. A little boy has a weak heart and has to be taken for surgery. His father is poor and does not have enough money for a surgery. So the little boy has to die. His father cannot take this and takes takes the hospital's emergency room hostage until the doctors agree to perform the operation.Besides the fact this is a copy of a Hollywood movie AGAIN, this is a very bad copy... AGAIN! If people cannot make a better movie than the one that already exist, than don't.The script is very bad. The whole movie Sanjay has to be the good father and it lays to thick on the movie that it is not believable. Sanjay has to many boring speeches like the writer want to teach his audience some moral stories like it has been written for little children. At the end you know in one very long speech why this movie is called Thathastu. Very bad written, very Bollywood.The little chubby kid who plays the son cannot act. There are so many children in India who can act, but do not get the chance, I don't get that. Amisha Patel is next to Bipasha Basu and Priyanka Chopra a very bad actress. She does not know what she is doing. Her role in not significant, but even though she sucks.People, if you haven't seen John Q, go see that movie and skip this one." 
" I am still repenting why i saw this movie","Yes, this is a remake of John Q. Yes, you cannot help compare to Denzel. However, this is definitely one of the worst movies of Sanjay Dutt. He has given worst performance. He is at the bottom of his game in this movie. You cannot help but keep on forwarding the movie in case u are watching it on computer,sorry for you if you find yourself in a theatre while watching. I have seen John Q and was wondering if it will be a waste of time. However, as movie progressed Sanjay has really made it stupid to watch . Recently there has been a string on nonsense movies coming ,this movie tops the list.The plot is completely meaningless. I just hope the choice of actors were better. Amisha is not suited for the role at all.Amisha was not able to bring or compliment the emotions needed. Even her make up was not suited for the role. She is pretty dumb to adapt to roles. I saw her teesri aankh. Even there she was lame. For her role she should have made an attempt to learn the sign language. So in this respect this was a half hearted attempt by the director and producer. I think failure of movie can be blamed on the whole team.I am still repenting why i saw this movie and why the hell m even commenting on it.May God forgive me ..............."
