" Mind-Numbingly DUMB!!!","After "Ramu Ki Aag" and "Karrzz", I came to the conclusion that Bollywood couldn't come up with anything worse than that!!! Bout obviously I was wrong! All because of this movie I lost two very IMPORTANT THINGS of my life!! 1. Valuable Money 2. Valuable Time During the 1st 20 minutes i kept on looking at my watch to figure when this movie would end!! The only relief in this movie was the 10 minute interval that i got at the local multiplex and i could buy my caramel popcorn!!! The movie had a great concept....But the director somehow managed to ruin it TOTALLY! Most predictable ending! Really Dumb dialogues!! Everything was SO clich√©! Please don't spend your time and money to watch this movie!!!!"
