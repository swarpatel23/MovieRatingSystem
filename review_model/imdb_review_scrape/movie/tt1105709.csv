" A must watch Thriller","From this year, I have observed that the Hindi cinema is taking a new leaf, more realistic, strong scripted and less dreamy story line, all in all its good to watch some really good movies in 2009. Way to go Bollywood.....Coming to the movie, from the start it will take you inside more deeply with every scene and your mind starts to think what could be the end? I definitely say the direction is way too good and every time he goes into the picture, you urge for one more second to find out the suspense. However, the sound effects could be better.Akshay has done a fantastic job i think he should have to look forward for some serious roles and just have to take a step back from his comedy stature. Javaid has fulfilled the character requirement and the rest are good. Ayesha Takia was'nt of much impact in her role. The movie is a good way to spend a Saturday night and believe me you will enjoy." 
" could have been better","i saw this movie. i liked the story. but i felt there is some problem in the direction, they made the movie like a family drama or something like that. a bit of chill and would have made it better. in whole cinema in just one scene it looks like thriller, the scene where akshay and Ayesha searching the house. I also felt tired watching the same scene again again when it shows akshay going into the pic and his journey to the boat. in the movie they can give some clues about the ending to us, at once the ending feels like the '80's movie. but hats off to the production team to try a new genre... but whatever it is, it is not a thriller, you can say it mystery movie." 
" Definitely superior product than Akki's previous no-brainer outings!!!","Its not bad as it's projected to be. Akshay Kumar's flop-series have resulted in denting the prospects of 8x10 Tasveer. In my opinion, 8x10 is indeed quite an intelligent movie and deserves intelligent audience to appreciate it.Akshay Kumar:: Delivers a good performance. And yes, special mention to his fresh look. Seems like he is back in shape. Jaaved Jaffery:: At the risk of being repetitive, he indeed has potential. Pity Bollywood doesn't pay attention.The rest of the star-cast is adequate. The look of the movie is very much Hollywoodish and this cannot be refuted. Even the cycling scenes are aesthetically done. Notice the execution when the GMC revves the engines - indeed Hollywood standards. And yes, the execution and portrayal of Akshay Kumar ability is of top standards. The narrative deserves special mention here. At a given point in time, the audience is shown what is warranted thereby keeping the suspense alive. Kudos to Mr. Kukunoor (well, he has followed this format in Teen Deewarien earlier).I seriously hope 8x10 gets critical acclaim for Mr. Kukunoor for he well-deserves it and indeed catapults him into the big league." 
" Nagesh Kukunoor vs. Akshay Kumar. Who's the villain?!!","Saw the movie today and I feel this is director Nagesh Kukunoor's best, after Iqbal. And also his first murder mystery thriller! Everything is quite cool about the movie whether it's Canada's locations, cinematography, the music, special effects, performances & above all, the story & direction. Akshay's screen presence & Javed Jaffrey's comedy is what engages your eye throughout. And everyone else adds their bit of strength to the cast like the cutie pie Ayesha Takia, evergreen Girish Karnad & Sharmila Tagore and the rest. I've begun to believe that Nagesh is the Manoj Shyamalan of Bollywood cinema! They've kinda similar feel towards film-making. Nothing so negative about the movie but I felt Akshay could've emoted better. Anyway, you'll have a mighty surprise to know who's the killer in the end, probably a chill! So, who's the primary 'evil' behind this fascinating murder mystery? Nagesh Kukunoor or Akshay Kumar? You decide after watching the movie :)" 
" u need to see it , go watch the "8 * 10".......akki rocks..","my rating - 8/10. another super performance from the best in the business "AKSHAY KUMAR". akki has a super natural power to go in the past time through pictures , the time whenever those pics were taken... n he uses this power to solve his own dad's murder mystery.. the story is simple but the visual effects r very well done... n the music is outstanding,both songs n background score , n i m glad that there is only one song in this movie.. the length of the movie is also ideal , almost 2 hours..."u need to see it , go watch the "8 * 10"" (i need the picture , go get the "8 * 10") just hail the king of kings "AKSHAY KUMAR"...." 
" Quite a respectable whodunit/thriller (don't be guided by the cover description)","This is set in Canada where Akshay Kumar plays a Park Ranger. It seems he has a small psychic ability among his skills. On occasion he can gaze into a photo and drop into trance briefly where he is able to see what happened about the time the photo was taken. He doesn't do this often as it taxes him physically. His father drowns apparently from a heart attack but a former policeman who knew the father believes it was murder. A photo has been taken just prior to the drowning. The Akshay character then goes into the photo a number of times seeking the perspective of each person in the photo at the time. I hadn't been sure about getting it. The cover photo is very dark and references to it make it sound quite violent. Actually we found it was no more troubling than an episode of 'Midsommer Murders'. In fact there are a few more murders after Dad goes down but they are circumspect and not graphic. The description on the back of the DVD didn't even seemed to match the plot of the movie: almost like we'd got a heavily edited version or different one. The emphasis was on the supernatural but really a bit of going into a photo is pretty minor 'supernatural". It says he can touch the past of dead people by touching something belonging to them BUT THAT WASN'T IN THE MOVIE- all he could do was the photo-trance thing! (this wasn't the only inconsistency) The Indian reviewers found the movie left a few questions, and described the revelation of who had done it as 'shocking". We agreed with that we queried some of the plot at the end but not enough to ruin it by any means. Nor were we at all shocked by the revelation of the killer. It isn't a song & dance Bollywood nor is it art-house. The music is in the background. Canada looked picturesque and the plot unfolded at a good pace. Akshay Kumar did a fine job with the character (and we wish he'd skip comedy and stick with straighter movies.) They flirted for a moment with adding a silly side to the former policeman that wasn't necessary but otherwise everyone acted well. This is a movie that didn't do well in India and has received mixed responses) perhaps because it is more Western) but was quite a watchable and respectable thriller/whodunit. There is suspense but it isn't scary, dark or violent." 
" Beware!!!..donate your 150 bucks to a poor guy instead...u'll feel better","Now that's what we call a film ..errrr sorry a B-grade film.. Sux bigtym. The film looks like it was hurried for release, but that's not the case coz it has been ready for release for d past 5-6 months or so. Then why does the film look so unpolished?? Even there was no ample publicity for the film. Akshay Kumar was OK-OK but the rest of the cast really let it down. I wonder what was Aayesha Takia doing there. She only has a single expression on her face n dat of "uninterested" type. She seemed to be quite uninterested in the film. Action scenes were few, and the ones that were there didn't look convincing. The storyline could have been better. The script should have been developed. there's no element of surprise in the film and for a mystery film this is the end of thrills.Also the fact that at the end the director and the scriptwriters choose to go the 80's and the 90's type of bollywood thriller movie. A long lost twin brother returning back even though there was a change here, the long lost brother turns evil and wow they thought they had something new in their hands. That really made me and many other people laugh out loud. Also i remember a same plot although not entirely but do you remember "Andaaz Apna Apna"?, yes the comedy caper starring Aamir and Salman Khan, now do you remember paresh rawal's character? aka the twins??, yes you got it, now you see, the director wanted this movie to be a laugh riot like "AAA" but what the hell was that?.the first half of the movie was really quite decent. I really had some hopes while going back in after the interval, but how cheated i felt. The second half of the movie turned into a silly B-Grade bollywood thriller. I wish i had a photograph taken right before the script writing for this movie started, so that i could know who is behind this piece of crap.I go for 2 out of 10 for Akshay Kumar's 8x10 Tasveer Watch it at your own risk or better go and watch a b-grade bollywood thriller, at least you won't have high expectations with that type of a movie." 
" Bollywood has turned Nagesh into a whore","Nagesh Kukunoor was one of my idol directors from India. I had never expected anything so cheap from him. Not only the story is a worthless piece of rat-droppings, the direction is crappy too. Akshay Kumar has done what he could, which unfortunately could not save the movie. This is sad time for Indian directors. The director who is capable of making Dor, Iqbal and Hyderabad Blues should never make a cheap thriller like this. This is not only dumbing down his own work, but the whole Hindi art cinema industry. I would also like to plead to Hindi movie fans that, Instead of trying to increase the ratings, please rate Hindi movies seriously. This will help promote them further. Movies like this deserve low score, which makes other better movies recommendable." 
" I still cant figure out the genre of this movie","I am a big Akshay Kumar fan, and even though many people told me that this movie is disappointing, I still couldn't stop myself. The movie starts off really well and you really feel the intensity. But I am still unable to figure out the genre of the movie..You cant call this a suspense because most of the realities in the movie comes in the end..The movie had a potential...but the ending was so terrible that you would start hating the movie...I almost thought Akki has pulled off another movie like Bhool Bhulaiya...(which I thought was the best suspense/thriller I have ever watched)..After watching this movie, I feel like giving it a negative rating....Singh is King and then Tasveer, Akki..come on man you are better than the Khans...." 
" Worth Watching At least once.","A thriller that will keep one glued to the seat all the way through as it revolves around a man who has the ability to see the past and he uses it to help others, even though it can kill him.Starring Akshaye Kumar, Ayesha Takia, Girish Karnad, Sharmila Tagore, Anant Mahadevan, Javed Jaffrey, Pia Shah, Benjamin Gilani, Uttara Baokar and Rushad Rana, this thriller genre movie is directed and written by Nagesh Kukunoor.Akshaye in such genre movies is always good and he has performed well but I must say that some are beginning to find his style a bit of a bore and he should not just stick to similar roles – he is capable of doing other roles and he should do them. Surprisingly, his co – star, Ayesha Takia, who I did not like in her previous movies, "De Taali" and "Sunday," has also performed well as was Javed Jaffrey, who has gone on to perform tremendously well after "Salaam Namaste" and also performed well in "Dhamaal." But what really made it better for me was to see two favourite actors of mine – Sharmila Tagore and Girish Karnad after such a long time. Director Nagesh Kukunoor has also done a good job of this and more so since this is his first thriller genre movie, though he was suppose to direct a movie based on the life of the late playback singer Kishore Kumar. However, I get the feeling that this has been shelved and it would be rather sad, not just because of me, being a fan of Kishore Kumar, but also having watched "K for Kishore" and knowing the amount of time that Nagesh Kukunoor must have spent on the sets listening to the participants and making comments, must have made it difficult for him.The cinematography and especially the underwater sequence were breath taking and this will make one want to know what is going to happen next. The only negative side to this is that sometimes its quite predictable. On the whole, it is a movie that is worth watching." 
" A Thriller without thrills and excitement.","Nagesh Kukunoor, the director started off brilliantly a decade back and gave some exceptional movies like "Hyderabad Blues", "3 Deewarein", "Iqbal" and "Dor". But his last movie "Bombay To Bangkok" and the current "8X10 Tasveer" stand nowhere close to his own set standards. The same can be said about Akshay Kumar, who seems to be lost in the gigantic hype surrounding himself. After "Chandni Chowk to China" this will be the second setback to his otherwise hit record.The movie is based on a supernatural theme where Akshay can travel into the past by gazing on a picture and its individual characters. The subject looks exciting enough as we read or write about it, but the execution on the screen is not convincing at all as it lacks all the thrills and edge of the seat treatment required by the plot. Nagesh seems to be interested in making an artistic thriller, with long boring scenes, uninspiring writing and lazy editing.The story moves slowly with no worth mentioning scenes or sequences. Even the over publicized shot where Akshay jumps from a cliff into the water is amazingly canned but has no relevance at all with the narration or script. Akshay seems to be quite confused and doing his role without any conviction. There was also news of both director and actor facing tough times together shooting abroad. Sadly, that shows on the screen and also in Akshay's recent interviews given for the movie. The time gaps which occurred while making the movie may also be visible to the sharp enthusiastic bollywood fans. Interestingly the main picture in the movie, which has got all the focus gets easily caught as a reworked photograph with background pasted later.In a suspense thriller, the climax holds the key to its success. The more interesting and shocking the last minute revelations are, more are the chances of movie hitting the bull's eye. Moreover in a murder mystery it is always better that the culprit should be from the characters known to the viewer. If a sudden new entrant is introduced to be the killer then it takes away all the shock value and results in an unimpressive climax. This is the problem with "8X10 Tasveer" where the finale is too lengthy and not powerful as expected.Acting department has got Sharmila Tagore and Javed Jaffery at their best. Javed should have been given more comic freedom in his expressions by the director as that would have added a lot to the movie. Akshay is not in form as he is always. In many scenes it looks like he is deliberately stopping himself from doing a comedy act. Ayesha Takia looks cute but lacks the depth required for the role. Benjamin Gilani, Girish Karnad and Ananth Mahadevan are OK in their short roles. Cinematography is top rate, specially the chase and actions sequences. But its time our film makers should realize that usually songs are not meant to be there in thrillers and murder mysteries. All the songs are simply unwanted and not worth remembering also. On the other hand Background score is fine as per the demand of the subject.Now about the Inspirational influences of the movie:1. The camera view from the inside angle of an eye seems to be influenced from the movie "Being John Malkovich (1999)" 2. Akshay moving into the past and then people ready to bring him back with medical support is very close to the similar sequences in "Flatliners (1990)" 3. The movie poster with Akshay eyes staring in, has similarity to the poster of Anthony Hopkins brilliant movie "Instinct (1999)"In the end I would only like to say that after watching "8X10 Tasveer", I came to one conclusion that, both the talented director, Nagesh and hugely successful actor, Akshay now urgently need to re-invent themselves once again." 
" Awesome thriller & awesome Akshay.......","Tasveer is a superb thriller in all aspects. The cinematography, the BG, the locales everything was just so perfect. Tasveer in its own has set new standards of film-making, esp Hollywood style film-making.Coming to the movie, it is initially slow paced, but is needed to build up the story. As the film progresses, the pace is very well maintained. The BG music was just perfect to set your mood for a thriller. Its a movie shot very stylishly with amazing locales, added with some breathtaking stunts shot excellently. Nagesh certainly deserves an applause for such high quality direction usually seen in Hollywood movies. Regarding the climax, I didn't feel anything unusual in it. The climax really shock's everyone which is most important in a thriller. The thrill & suspense has been very well maintained till the end, and your curiosity to know the culprit just increases every passing minute.Coming to the acting part, Akshay Kumar's just amazing for this role. I cannot think of anyone else for this role other than Akshay Kumar. AKshay play's this role with extreme ease & grace and delivers a top-notch performance. Akshay was at his best performing those daredevil stunts, esp. the one where he jumps from the cliff. This film just proves that Akshay can play any role with effortless ease.Ayesha Takia was fine. Javed Jaafrey as expected was good with his humor. Rest of the cast was up to the mark.Music was excellent, with just 3 songs. BG was just perfect.Direction from Nagesh was just top-notch. Would like to see him making more thrillers.Lastly, Tasveer is a visual treat to your eyes, containing all ingredients of a perfect thriller movie. Highly Recommended!" 
" Really a superb movie !!","It's my habit to read the critics first and then watch the movie. But again I find our uneducated critics writers has rated this movie with 2 stars. what a fuss!! Go and sell vegetable in the market. (last time this happened with RNBDJ) Akshay Kumar really rocks in this movie. I will rate it 7 out of 10. This is a new concept in Hindi cinema which is giving us a picture which is solely based on the power of a man which makes him to see events from a photograph but only for 1 minutes. But as we have some Hindu believes, this movie clarifies this with a myth about souls. Remember - if the photograph will be destroyed then you will be lost inside the past as the photograph is the only source of your travel to past and future. Every moments thrills in this movie except watching Javed Jaffery.situations are amazing, locations are superb.Ayesha Takia also did a good job. On the last scene , she is really horrible. This is a must watch movie and you will find Akshay Kumar in a new look and new role after a long time." 
" A Nutshell Review: 8 X 10 Tasveer","It's probably a coincidence that the latest Bollywood offerings the last week had to do with photographs. In Aa Dekhen Zara, Neil Nitin Mukesh plays a photographer who discovers the secrets of a camera that has (well, I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag) powers to do with time. And in 8x10 Tasveer (photograph), Akshay Kumar plays forest ranger Jai, working for Environmental Protection in Alberta, Canada, who possesses the supernatural ability of transporting his soul back to the past, assuming the point of view of the person in the photograph whom he's staring at.Unlike The Butterfly Effect, his abilities are more passive. He cannot manipulate events as experienced by the body he's staring out from, and neither can he linger around for more than a minute, as each transportation brings about some severe weakening of his macho physique, akin to being knocked out by a heavyweight champion. So it's a risk he has to undertake in order to assist strangers who sought him out to help in locating their loved ones, and nothing will prepare him to use this power to solve his dad's murder aboard a luxury yacht.Akshay Kumar didn't get plenty of love from the box office for his previous kung-fu movie Chandni Chowk to China, which I had enjoyed actually. While I find this suspense thriller an above average flick thanks to Kumar's charismatic presence, one just cannot shrug away the sense of familiarity and deja vu in having watched a version of this film somewhere (someone jog my memory please!). 8x10 Tasveer still contains a decent "whodunnit" storyline that will keep you guessing, but only because it has that rug on standby just beneath your feet, which I think some would cry foul in being thrown an unexpected spanner from the blind side into the works.Supporting Jai in his quest to seek the truth, even as he subscribes to unorthodox methods, is ex-cop Happi ("Happy with an I") played by Javed Jaffrey (who voiced the villain Charlie Anna in Roadside Romeo), taking an interest in the publicized death just because he was on the receiving end of tremendous assistance given by Jai's father in helping him to settle down in a strange new city (of Toronto!). Happi's an interesting character injected just for some light hearted laughs though, being a character afflicted with OCD and kudos to Jaffrey in having to play this socially awkward character misfit who should have deserved more screen time.The narrative did feel draggy for a bit, despite clocking just under 2 hours with only one short musical ballad serving as a romantic interlude between Jai and his lady love Sheila (Ayesha Takia). And while you know that at some point Jai will have to perform a brute-force investigation by peeking through the eyes of everyone in a photograph, it just takes a while to get to that stage, before shifting into high gear during the last 30 minutes where you're likely to be surprised with a sudden turn of events. On one hand there was a sudden lift in the lull of the mystery, but on the other you'd feel it's one of those plot developments that felt a little of a cop out. It did answer some questions should you rewatch the film though, but seasoned mystery fans would likely clamour for more than the usual.And does anyone think Akshay Kumar does look like Nicholas Cage with that hang-dog look and closely crop hairdo? That 8x10 Tasveer poster did make Akshay resemble Cage in that Ghost Rider poster, and this film did feel like one which Cage would have no problems stepping into as well. 8x10 Tasveer is decent, though there's nothing that will particularly make you sit up and exclaim Wow." 
" 8 x 10 Tasveer is a bad movie","8 x 10 Tasveer, it's a failure on all counts and a film best avoided. Intended as a suspenseful thriller, 8 x 10 Tasveer is a hopelessly dumb film that suffers on account of an ill-conceived script that's ridden with logical loopholes. At every turn you find yourself questioning the film's ridiculous logic, befuddled by all the inconsistencies and creative liberties that you're expected to turn a blind eye to. When the suspense finally unravels, 8 x 10 Tasveer delivers a back-story so convenient, you could throw your hands up in the air and laugh at the sheer stupidity of the enterprise.Over the years, and with a few exceptions like Hyderabad Blues 2 and Bombay To Bangkok, director Nagesh Kukunoor's name on a film's credits has come to represent a fairly high standard in storytelling. Even without big budgets and fancy resources, the director delivered engaging stories and endearing characters like those in Iqbaal and Dor, to name just two. With his latest, 8 x 10 Tasveer though, Kukunoor turns in his most poorly executed effort. Random scenes are slapped together arbitrarily, loose ends never tied, and the narrative suffers from pace problems. x 10 Tasveer is neither thrilling nor imaginative, and apart from the lush photography, it's an exercise in futility. Director Nagesh Kukunoor attempts a film-making format he seems neither familiar nor comfortable with, and as a result the film lacks the integrity of his previous successes. For Akshay Kumar this film marks another misguided step after the ill-fated Chandni Chowk To China; this is after all, neither the mindless entertainment he has come to master, nor the art house credibility he aspires for.On the whole, 8 x 10 TASVEER disappoints. The film goes wrong, in fact horribly wrong, in the penultimate 20-25 minutes, which is the lifeline of any suspense-thriller. Nagesh Kukunoor has lost the plot this time!" 
" Taxing","This movie is full of random occurrences and loose ends which leave the viewer frustrated to the core. Not what I expected from ace filmmaker Nagesh Kukunoor.Story-wise, the film does not make much sense since everything is conveniently depicted without any nuances behind the process. Okay, so Akshay's unfortunate twin is behind the whole mess, but how does he manage to land up everywhere going unnoticed? How does Akshay survive the burning of the Tasveer? How does Sharmila Tagore escape the brutal attack by her son? Why do two stupid lines motivate the evil twin to commit suicide? How did Ayesha Takia keep fooling Akshay all the time? When did she meet his evil twin? And the biggest question of all, what bearing does Akshay's photo entering specialty have at all in this film? By the way, the explanation of how he developed this ability was no less frustrating itself.Performance-wise, Akshay is good. Ayesha is great here but has been cheated by the script like almost all others; especially Rushad Rana who seems to be what Jugal Hansraj is to Yashraj films, a compulsion. A waste of a good actor.Why do I give the film 2 stars then? One, it is well-polished in its graphics, pretty comparable to western films. Also, Salim-Suleiman's outstanding music is a complement to even lousy films, more so in the case of this one.Unlike many other reviewers, I wouldn't recommend this for even a one time watch. This is best given a miss."
