" just another in a big lot","well ! Just another entry in a big and i mean really big, lot of complete, mindless, effortless and useless ripoff of a Hollywood flicks. This one's an a to z copy of 'fools rush in', visit that page for story synopsis. As for recommendation, see my rating. And be wise. Stay as away from this movie as you can. Even if it's on some movie channel, and you can watch it for free. Believe me, a complete waste of three hours of your life. I still don't know what these guys think when they plan a movie. With Hollywood movies available so easily even in rural areas, i don't know how long can they continue doing this. But currently, that's what looks like is happening."
