" Best alternative to sleeping peels","After watching this movie (if you managed to complete), sleep is guaranteed. I watched this cause I forgot to check reviews beforehand and believed that Naseeruddin Shah do good movies only. The concept is good and will create interest in initial, but failed miserably as the story proceeds. I would blame Write and Director (same person) for making such a stupid movie and wasting theirs as well as others time and money. Cast performance is OK OK, but nothing for Shah to do. Movie is supposed to be a thriller, but there's is no thrill watching some stupid dreams and instant healing of people as a after effect of those dreams."
