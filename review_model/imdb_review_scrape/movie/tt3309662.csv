" The person deserves to be given a Jackpot who can dare to say that he enjoyed this.","When I first heard the famous Shahrukh Khan dialogue "Picture Abhi Baaki Hai Dost", it at once reminded me the original version of this expression which was more brutal and at your face, used in director Kaizad Gustad's debut project released in 1998. The film was BOMBAY BOYS which impressed many with its novel narrative and just when everybody in the theater thought that it was over with a blank screen, there came a voice over saying "Aye Khatam Nahin Hua C@#$%#". And the dialogue became quite famous in youngsters in those days along with a fabulous song "Mumbhai" sung by Javed Jaafri.After this moderate success, the director made BOOM in 2003 which was a big disaster but had reputed actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Jackie Shroff, Gulshan Grover, Jaaved Jaafri and glamorous girls like Padma Lakshmi, Madhu Sapre, Katrina Kaif and Zeenat Aman playing the key roles. However it is a different thing that most of these names today regret doing that film for their own obvious reasons. Post the major debacle there was news of few stalled films plus controversies at regular intervals before director Kaizad Gustad made a comeback with his JACKPOT after a gap of 10 years having Naseeruddin Shah in the key role once again as was there in his BOMBAY BOYS.Now the reason to begin with all these forgotten references of the past is that even after a decade of amazing developments, changing mindsets and new age cinema, director Kaizad Gustad made me feel exactly the same as I had felt while watching his mindless BOOM back in 2003. And the only difference was that in BOOM I did have faces to look at sitting by my side when I couldn't understand what was happening, whereas here in JACKPOT there were only empty seats to look at feeling helpless.The film began in a pathetic manner with a completely sick dialogue of Naseer roaming around in a weird get-up and then just after 20 minutes, I had a strong urge of asking the few people sitting in the theater that whether they could even understand any single thing in the film till now. The interval came at mere 45 minutes and by then it was pretty clear that this was nothing but a big opportunity wasted by both the director and his actor-producer in a very over-confident and irresponsible manner.The so called thriller based on a team of con-men failed to make any sort of impact till its laughable climax and honestly after a while I was not even interested in watching Sunny Leone doing all those things she was expected to do in this senseless, unexciting and irritating venture. In short the only thing which game me some relief moments in those 100 minutes was the song "Kabhi Jo Baadal Barse" and that's it. So in my opinion, you should clearly get the clue to stay away from this bad attempt and if any JACKPOT is there then it should be readily given to the person who can dare to say that he really enjoyed the film and liked its suspense too." 
" Jackpot Goes Crackpot. â™¦ 11%","Everything's a little strange about the latest venture by the man who gave us Bombay Boys. The cast, their performances, the plot, the title sequence, the twists and the songs: all are so weird, you will not stand a minute of any of the foolhardy joke happening on the screen.What was Naseeruddin Shah thinking? After his JohnDay debacle, this is too scary for me to remember as a film he acted on. Sachiin Joshi should just stop. Just stop and live the rest of his life doing anything but movies. And if your curiosity for the film is solely based on Sunny Leone, I can't imagine your disappointment on her rather unimpressive show at both acting and flashing. The story revolves around a con work where both side of the parties seem clever, yet are dumb-witted.Now what is Disney doing in here hatching a 250 acre plot to start a Disneyland in Goa? Terrible thinking of the writers. Cinematography is the worst thing about the film and if something does amuse you, the camera work will nullify it. Direction, show-shining, editing & use of songs are just beyond terrible. Nothing works in flow and thank heavens it only lasted for 100 minutes.BOTTOM LINE: Spare your time & cash for this is 2013's greatest blunder.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO" 
" Do not pin your hope on the film. Misses the jackpot","In the early 90's , Kaizad Gustad struck a chord with Indian audience with niche films in form Bombay Boys. Over the years, he has lost energy to tap in quality product. Jackpot is yet another dud from Kaizad Gustad which will be forgettable once you leave the theater.Jackpot tells the story of con attempted by amateur gang members. Things turns topsy turvy when they discover about reverse con played upon them.Right from the openings credits inspired by a James Bond film to the typical action thriller set in Goa, Jackpot does not liven your spirit at any moment. Kaizad Gustad tries hard but falls flat on the face with weak script. The film do have some twist and turns but it never re- ignites the mood. Cinematography and art direction are below the mark as if you are watching some 90's drama. Naseeruddin Shah is only silver lining in the mess. Sunny Leone and Sachin Joshi are over the top.Do not pin your hope on the film. Misses the jackpot . Poor 1/5"
