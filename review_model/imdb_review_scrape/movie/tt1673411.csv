" Mutharamkunnu PO","This movie is the Hindi version of the Malayalam Hit - Mutharamkunnu PO, directed by Sibi Malayil and written by Jagadish in association with Sreenivasan. Jagadish appears in this movie as well and enacts the same role he handled in the original version. Checkout http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237479/. I prefer the original version better. Rajpal Yadav has done pretty good. Movie is worth watching. As per the star cast and localities, it reminded me the Malamaal Weekly premise. Its been shot in the same place. The way the movie is taken will confuse the viewer whether its a Priyadarsan movie. But its not. And Rajiv kumar has done a decent job directing this one without spoiling the actual movie." 
" Good and simple comedy.","Recently,i saw this movie and i was not able to differentiate whether this was Priyadarshan's creation or not.Rajeev Kumar(Director) has done pretty much like the Priyadarshan.The story is simple,letter's of both the wrestler's in each other's home due to confusion creates a revolution in the movie,while this confusion is continue,Postman Chandair is secretly in love with one of the Wrestler's daughter and can only marry her when he will win the wrestling against the king of wrestler's "The Great Khali".Although,the movie is failed on the Box Office but yet the coming of "The Great Khali" has increased the response of the people.I will tell you go and watch it you will really enjoy the movie.Thanx"
