" Excellent cool movie, a must watch...","It Endorses the family values which are fast disappearing in todays world. Reaffirms that if you love or work sincerely, without expecting any returns, you may truly get what you set out to achieve. Brilliant performance by Akshay. He is very restrained yet very strong and emotive. Katarina looks ravishing and communicates very well with her eyes. Her Hindi has also improved tremendously. Rishi Kapoor brings in a whiff of fresh air from his yesteryear's. Javed Shaikh of Pakistan also played good role. It'll make you both feel good about yourself. If you like light well paced romantic movies, this is excellent movie. If you like light well paced romantic movies, this is excellent movie." 
" A marvelous acting by Akshay Kumar","Story is good,it revolves around Katrina Kaif(jasmeet, Jazz), A London born and raised Indian girl,She wants to live her life her way and not according to his parents but movie takes a twist with entry of Akshay,whose love forces Katrina to marry him.Besides movie also shows friendship of Indians and Pakistanis in London.Some dialogs and scenes showing greatness of India are also there.Katrina is looking fabulous in movie.Punjabi people will have great fun watching movie. on the whole a nice time pass.Rishi kappor has also done a great acting.Upen is also good.the only thing that sounds insane in movie is Akshay falling in true love with Katrina on first sight and whole story moves further on this base." 
" A Fun Film","It was a fun to watch. Akshay was amazing. It could have been better but all in all a good time pass flick. I only went to watch the film due to Katrina .. but ended up applauding the Character of Akshay Kumar The plot is simple yet so complex. Guy loves the girl. Girl doesn't but so much happens in between that you cant just help laughing. Rishi kapoor is very funny in his role of a worried Punjabi father.Katrina is gorgeous she and Akshay make a good couple. The acting makes this movie good although the first half was a bit boring before Akshay's entry.. I think this film should do well.... All in all a fun film.. watch it .. enjoy it..then forget it..." 
" Best! Romantic and beautiful!","One of my favourite movies.. The chemistry between Akshay and Katrina is on point. It's one of those movies u can watch over and over again." 
" A masterpiece","Watching a movie after a year of it being released hardly gives you the kick when you see it when it's still hot in the theatres and everybody's going ga-ga about it. However, this is one movie that I watched twice in succession. Come to think of it and I bet you can hardly remember doing that yourself. And if you are one of those guys who look for perfection in a movie it's the closest you can get. The movie is mostly shot in London and has this customary beginning about NRI families who have trouble with their kids being brought up in a western society but don't get disheartened you ain't in for a shock. Also, don't go by the story of the movie which doesn't draw you to the movie but for once give in to your instincts about the movie being a success story at the box office and I can assure you that you are in for a treat. You might not be able to relate to it but given the performances it sure is going to tickle a nerve in your heart." 
" Though Weighed Down By Bollywood Conventions, Namastey London Engages And Attempts To Shed Light On The South Asian Diaspora In London, Just Don't Take It Too Seriously","Namestey London is a refreshing film in that it gives centre-stage to a British woman of Indian origin, and does not portray her as a one-dimensional, rich-girl vixen, tempting the Bollywood hero away from his constant, truly Indian, girl-next-door. Instead the central character of Namastey London, Jasmeet 'Jazz' Malhotra, played by real British Asian Katrina Kaif, is being pressured into travelling to the Punjab to have an arranged marriage. Moreover, Jasmeet's Muslim friend Imran is in a similar position, a man with a white girlfriend who is deplored by his family.Namesty London is an enjoyable film, with a quirky, engaging plot and characters. The cast is generally good, with comedian Nina Wadia fine as Jasmeet's mother, Javed Sheikh assured as Imran's dictatorial father, and Akshay Kumar suitably playing up to his zany character, but never overdoing it as Arjun, Jasmeet's arranged husband. But Rishi Kapoor deserves a special mention. His performance as Jasmeet's father is not only funny and delightful- he also manages to find real anxiety and confusion.Unfortunately, with the exception of Kapoor, Namestey London as a whole attempts, but fails to achieve the deeper, more profound socio-political shades it seems to be aiming for, and it is with this that I take exception. Despite having a refreshing set-up and more than one-dimensional characters, Namastey London cannot quite shake off traditional, as well as superficial, Bollywood conventions about British people, whether Anglo-Saxon or of Asian extraction.The first is the assumption that ethnic Indians raised in the west are more westernised than native Indians, fully absorbed into the dominant western culture, living the fast, modern, materialistic life- full to the brim with confidence, even arrogance. While some do, this is not a typical experience. Rather, it seems to me, native Indians can be more like this. Such Indians are likely to be wealthy, urbanised Indian residents. Go to a 'Caf√© Coffee Day' in one of Bombay's more fashionable districts, in Bandstand for instance, overlooking the bay, and you may find young Indian women from wealthy backgrounds talking loudly, and self-consciously, about guys, jobs, fashion, and other girls, all in a vulgar way, as they try to imitate their image of westerners.In my experience, no doubt informed by my being a British Asian, the majority of British Asians tend to have grown up in a fragmented cultural environment, divided between the dominant western culture outside the home, which has historically not been welcoming to them at times, and the insular, ossified, traditional culture that their parents stick to at home, trying to recreate an India which, rather ironically, is fading away.I feel that the makers of Namestey London have tried to grasp this cultural fragmentation in Jasmeet 'Jazz' Malhotra's situation, not least in displaying her cultural fragmentation in her two names, the formal Jasmeet and her nickname outside the home, Jazz. She has a stern, backward-looking father and a forward-looking mother wishing for her daughter to become modern and westernised. I have no problem in understanding that people in real life have such backgrounds, except that I find Jasmeet's particular character, as explained by her family's circumstances which have produced her character's psychology, to be too simplistic and therefore unconvincing. 'Jazz' clearly comes across as the product of a preconceived, modern, urbanised Indian imagining of a young British Asian woman, rather than a fully researched and thought through British Asian character, rooted in a more secure sense of reality. True, the actress who played her, the fast-rising Katrina Kaif, is a British Asian, but strangely her performance seems to have been more informed by her years in the United States. Contrast her performance with Rishi Kapoor's, as noted above, and you will see that this doesn't help the film.The second Bollywood convention that the film retains concerns its depiction of Anglo-Saxon British people. There is no doubt that many British people have had something of a colonial hangover in their relations with Indian immigrant communities, which has manifested itself at times in the form of racism. However, the British characters in Namestey London are nothing more than stereotypes of a jaundiced colonialist Indian imagination. It makes for unintentionally uproarious comedy- such as when Charlie Brown introduces Jasmeet and her arranged, but still unofficial husband, to his relative. Charlie's relative is, funnily enough, a descendant of an East India Companyman, who himself seems to have been transported from a cantonment at the height of the Raj. And though it is good to see, in the same scene, Jasmeet telling him of the many successes of modern India, something which needs stressing to many in the west too hung-up on India's continuing failures, this is lazy film making- they should show this through situation and character.Still, though it is weighed down by traditional Bollywood conventions, Namastey London does engage the viewer and attempts to shed light on the South Asian Diaspora in London, just don't take it too seriously." 
" An Excellent Feel Good Movie","It makes you feel good about your country. Endorses the family values which are fast disappearing in todays world. Reaffirms that if you love selflessly, without expecting any returns, you truly get what you set out to achieve. Brilliant performance by Akshay. He is very restrained yet very strong and emotive. The part where the Englishman from the erstwhile East India company rants about India being a nation of snake charmers and the answer that Akshay politely gives him would gladden any person's heart. Katarina looks ravishing and communicates very well with her eyes. Her Hindi has also improved tremendously. Rishi Kapoor brings in a whiff of fresh air from his yesteryear's. Watch it with your better half. It'll make you both fell good about yourself." 
" Best movie ever made in Bollywood in this Context!","I fell in love with you since the first time i saw you and the commitment Akshay made that he won't leave until he saw her getting married that makes that character my hero,as a guy who went through same similar circumstance my only saying to all the fan of this movie is to only let them know that if you love someone truly never give up. No matter what the up's and down is there anyone could overcome it.Look at this, some guy from from native village in India never loose his hope for the girl who is truly westerner in every aspect. If he can get the love of his life than if anyone can but funny thing not everyone can be Akshay and so not everyone could fall in love Katrina." 
" Engaging Bollywood Masala","First and foremost, Namstey London is a treat to the eyes. The modern day London has been captured very well. Namastey London comes across as a pleasant surprise in more ways than one. Be it the characterization, the well executed script or the breathtaking visuals of London.... it succeeds in capturing your attention. All the characters are well written and the screenplay is very tight, keeps you interested throughout the movie. This is undoubtedly Vipul Amrutlal Shah's best work till date. His last venture 'Waqt' was termed as very melodramatic. The movie is sentimental make no mistake about that, but it works. It works brilliantly.Manmohan Singh (Rishi Kapoor) is settled in London for the past 20 years or so. Jazz or Jasmeet (katrina Kaif) is Manmohan Singh's spoilt daughter. Manmohan Singh brings Jazz to India and gets her married to Arjun Singh (Akshay Kumar), a rough and tough Punjabi who can barely speak English. But Jazz too is equally determined to marry her British boyfriend Charlie Brown. Arjun is helplessly and hopelessly in love with his beautiful but unyielding wife.The first half is pacy with many moments which tickle your funny bone. Rishi Kapoor is marvelous in his role as a frustrated father of a spoilt girl. Katrina Kaif looks stunning and does her part quite well. The second part is longer and belongs completely to Akshay Kumar who has matured immensely as an actor. He makes you laugh and he makes you cry. Akshay Kumar truly exceeds expectations. The scene where he explains what India is about to the foreigner is unarguably the scene of the movie.All in all Namastey London is a must watch. Don't miss it." 
" Good movie","Jasmeet aka Jazz is a spoiled girl who in spite being born to an Indian couple considers herself a British. She doesn't consider her selves as an Indian until she was taken to her father's village by her father, Where she meets a man who changed her life forever.The is overall quiet entertaining. It is also trying convey messages regarding the Indian cultures and values. It shows that celebration means not just to go out and have drinks with your friends. The background score is excellent. Salim-Suliaman did a good job. Songs are okay but not too impressive. Akshay Kumar did well in his role as the 'Funjabi' boy. Katrina Kaif surprisingly delivered a good performance. She suited her role well. She had the British-Indian look and it is there in speech as well. She did have her moments. The movie actually belonged to Rishi Kapoor with his excellent performance. Others also did well.Overall the movie is worth a watch. 8/10" 
" Kaif wins your affection, but Kumar wins the heart!","This film reminded me of so many others produced by Bollywood (or Indian) directors...Bride & Prejudice, The Namesake, Monsoon Wedding - each carry similar themes of the strained relations which arise between Indian immigrants living abroad and Westerners, and portray tensions within Indian immigrant families between first and second generations as well.Why is it that the Westerner love-interest in these fims is always wealthy? A wealthy Brit (Charlie Brown of Namastey London), a wealthy American (W. Darcy of Bride and Prejudice), or a wealthy New Yorker (Jacinda Barrett in The Namesake)? Why do Indian films usually show the prejudice of the upper classes of Westerners?? Perhaps it makes for more interesting story-telling..Unlike other Punjabi fathers portrayed in similar films, I found the father figures disturbing in Namastey London. There was a violence, rage, and anger in their characters, acted out towards members of their family in debilitating and humiliating ways, which made the fathers completely unbecoming individuals. Jazz' father humiliates her, and his wife; and, Imran's father does the same. I much prefer the gentle Punjabi fathers portrayed in films like, Bride and Prejudice, and Bend it Like Beckham, over these two gentleman.Jazz' character was extremely believable in terms of her unwillingness to see herself as Indian, and Arjun's character does a tremendous job of turning her around...The best feature of this film is the gentle, genuine, and honorable manner in which Arjun's character slowly wins her over. Worth seeing for this reason alone - enjoy!" 
" Good, but could have been better.","Namastey London, tells the tale of British-Indian young lady, named Jasmeet (Katrina Kaif), who is taken to India by her parents to marry a nice, Indian man, Arjun (Akshay Kumar). However, this marriage is in trouble from the get-go, due to the fact that Jasmeet (or Jazz as she likes to be called), is in love with another man. The movie is a mixture of mainly two other films, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam,and Purab Aur Pachhim. However, despite the fact that this movie carries similarities to these other films, it has the ability to hold its own ground, and this is primarily due to four factors: the acting, the cinematography, the Indian patriotism, and the humor.The majority of actors have done their jobs well. Akshay is relaxed and comfortable in his role, as usual. Rishi Kapoor, is a stand-out in his role of a very loving, yet traditional father. However, it is Katrina Kaif's acting which is the problem. Katrina looks beautiful, and her physical acting is well-done, but her voice and diction still need serious work. In this movie, she was allowed to do her own voice-over, despite the fact that her Hindi is poor. The director thought that since she plays a British girl, this would be fine. I disagree. Even NRI's can speak Hindi well to a certain extent, but Katrina's Hindi is horrendous, and after a couple minutes of the movie, becomes very annoying." 
" Good Movie!","I enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh so much. Akshay is kinda getting old for the young hero role but his acting was great! He made me laugh the most. One thing that bugged me during this movie was that Katrina was supposed to be born and raised in England, but she did not have a British accent at all! She spoke English like an American. I am half Indian, born and raised in the USA and i know a British accent when i hear one. I think Katrina usually has an American accent when she speaks English but that doesn't explain why she didn't act in a British accent! But anyways, she was beautiful in this movie and i loved it! GO SEE IT!" 
" a incredibly good movie","i saw this movie in a theater near my home. it is a very good Indian movie. it is typically a masala, bollywood movie, which means it is full of entertainment. you will regret if you will not watch this movie in a theater near you. the director has done a great job. it has the complete dosage of comedy, romance, emotions. the music is also very good. i think it will the one of the biggest hits of 2007despite of the cricket world cup going on. it a complete roller coaster, some of the scenes in the movie are 2 hilarious . the first half is out and out comedy. the second half has a little less comedy. but it is also entertaintment. talking about the performances. everyone is good. katrina has improved a lot. rishi kapoor has done a fine job.but the actor who has done a great job is akhsay kumar. you will surely love this man. you will laugh with him, you will cry with him. he is extraordinary in the movie. so watch this movie if you haven't watch a good movie for quite a while. and plz don't watch it on cd or DVD. u will regret this. it is one of the few best movies which u can see on a big screen." 
" mixed bag but worth it","I saw 'Namaste London' today and was pleasantly surprised. Ever since the Namaste London trailers began on b4u i have wanted to see it, just because it looked fun. Overall it was a lot better written and acted than i expected.The film is set in London, the Punjab and then London again. The film starts off well and you really get a sense of how much fun jazz has.However in my personal opinion the early nightclub scene was a bit much!. This scene was meant to display how westernised/uninhibited jazz and Imran were but it is guilty of making women at UK nightclubs look like prostitutes and the nightclubs like places for roman orgies!! (i have been to various nightclubs at home and abroad to feel justified in saying this!). With scenes like that it is not surprising that the father drags his daughter off on a family holiday.The scenes set in India are beautiful and there is a lot of comedy as prospective husbands are introduced to jazz, in fact the India segment was so well written that i was sorry when the happy/unhappy couple return to the UK (now looking less vibrant after the Punjab).Once home the heroine decides that despite everything she wants to get married to her English boyfriend. the love-struck hero meanwhile has the unenviable task of winning jazz's love, keeping his pride, impressing the British, reconciling Imran and his family (a nice little sub-story) and not falling into the trap of being too good to be true.The music is good but not memorable. This movie seems to be a family film (comedy/love/sport/conterversial issues/family relationships).However this family film lacks the usual catchy songs. Not one song apart from 'Rafta Rafta' (which is no 'Aisa Des Hai Mera') is above average. With other films producing great songs ('Dhoom Again', 'Barso Re', 'Salaam-e-Ishq') you do feel disappointed.The characters are a mixed bunch. The father played by Rishi Kapoor is at times endearing (with his family in the Punjab & at the end), but most of the time he is completely repellent and overbearing (as many have pointed out he is always unnecessarily humiliating his wife and daughter). The mother has a very small role but, when she does speak in Hindi, what she says is always true and for me she was the best character. The English boyfriend is good-looking but a bit of a jerk. In fact the British boyfriend is a very well written character just bad enough for you not to root for him, but not slimy enough to be a villain. Having said that there is no doubt, even from the beginning, which suitor jazz will end up with.Before dealing with the main characters, I would just like to criticise the portrayal of the British. When the Singh side won the rugby match I cheered too as the boyfriend had behaved appallingly, and I was glad when Imran didn't cave into his snooty prospective in-laws wishes. However the rest of it just irritated me, because I felt that there were things that had been needlessly dwelt upon. I didn't like the way imran's girlfriend at the beginning was portrayed as the easy white meat, nor the ways she dresses and acts. Call me oversensitive but even if British women are less conservative in their love lives than their Indian counterparts, the girlfriend in this movie is not your typical British girl in terms of wardrobe and blandness!. Another more important scene is the engagement party where the patronising, ignorant and plain rude white guy who is set right by the hero. Now these people do exist and the character deserved the put-down he got but why was this stereotypical display of racism and bigotry included?! The ignorant racist scene is obviously meant to show 1)jazz's realisation of how proud she is to be Indian 2)how the boyfriend doesn't respect her or her culture 3)how educated and eloquent the hero is. However is it really necessary?.Yes, it makes you question, but not as the makers would have you question. Can jazz not appreciate her roots without this? Can the audience not see how wonderful India and her people are for themselves? Do we really need the whole 'Rang Basanti' / 'The Rising' / 'lagaan' element from Akshay?. I find it hard to explain but it all just seemed a bit gratuitous, and forgive me but the inclusion of this scene shows, that for all the Namaskar gestures Indians can not forgive or forget (probably justified though).To give ashkay his due in terms of acting he made a very good job of what was a clich√©d role and was very believable. Something which SRK & Salman couldn't have achieved. Only problem is I don't like the look of Akshay at all! The ORANGE hair and the smile in particular. Obviously the character was supposed to be attractive rather than handsome, but why could not the role have been played by someone a little younger than 40 year old akshay? The age difference between him and Katrina is not disturbing, but I would have rather seen a 'Funjab' BOY rather than an overgrown boy. Akshay needs to stop playing the 'loverboy roles' and do something more 'omkhara', more 'water' (more 'Don' even!). Katrina was very good and believable." 
" A standard NRI film which exploits foreign locations and Indian emotions to the hilt","Namastey London attempts to discuss the regular issue with NRIs. They all want their children to be born and brought up in the foreign lands but when the question of their marriage arises they all want the prospective bride or groom to be an Indian. While Namastey London brings up this genuine problem in its story, the solution it offers is simply ludicrous.An NRI father Manmohan Singh (Rishi Kapoor) wants her pampered spoilt daughter Jasbeer aka Jazz (Katrina Kaif) to get married to an Indian. So he gets her to India where he starts hunting grooms for his daughter. One day he sees a man flirting with his daughter (and while this would appall any father), Mr. Singh instantly decides that this guy would be the perfect match for his daughter. While Jazz is justifiably not interested in this gaav-ka-gawaar (Akshay Kumar) because of the vast cultural difference, Singh, much against his daughter's wishes gets the two married. And the audience is supposed to support the father because the village simpleton groom he chooses is none other that our hero ¬ñ Arjun (Akshay Kumar).Post marriage they all land up in London where Jazz disapproves of their marriage. The audience is now expected to sympathize with the hero because he was duped into a false marriage. What about the injustice done to the heroine by forcing her into a wedlock? Kindly overlook that. In fact you are now made to detest the heroine's decision of marrying a British who is divorced thrice. Obviously you know who will get the girl in the end. And how? Our hero doesn't fight back for all that's happened to him. He goes into the Shahrukh Khan mode of waiting with all the confidence in the world that one fine day the heroine will surely come back to him.Namastey London is a standard NRI film which exploits foreign locations and Indian emotions to the maximum. The idea is simple ¬ñ shoot the film extensively abroad and patronize Indian cultures and values throughout. There is also a prolonged sequence where Akshay Kumar gives big gyaan to the British people about the greatness of India with lines like 'we have 24 languages, some 600 newspapers and 12 crore readers'. So what? And the scene has no connection with the story whatsoever other than invoking patriotic feelings and exploiting sentimental values.The screenplay is replete with many such redundant scenes that don't amuse in any way. For instance, there is a scene where Katrina comes across Prince Charles in Buckingham Palace (duplicate, of course). The scene neither evokes excitement nor laughter and one simply fails to understand its significance. In another scene there is a gay smooch in a disco. What for? Nobody knows. The way in which Akshay Kumar plays rugby and even wins against the British is simply ridiculous. Then there is a song picturized in the fields on Punjab amidst tractors which could be awarded as the most 'unintentionally funny' choreographed song. Some scenes are blatantly incorporated only for brand promotions.Now the much-hyped talk of whether the film is a remake of 'Purab aur Paschim'. The answer is 'No'. Because the film is not inspired from just one film but derives heavily from many films of the late 80s which dealt with the theme of an English mem getting married to a desi babu like Govinda's Banarasi Babu or Anil Kapoor's Abhimanyu. The scene in the climax where Akshay Kumar speaks English for the first time in the film is clearly inspired from Rekha's Biwi Ho To Aisi. A lot of Pardes effect is palpable in the second half esp. when Katrina refuses sex to her English lover before marriage. And Namastey London is the nth film that has a Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam ending with the only difference that you can predict the end of this film in its first scene itself.The next big hype on the film was the Himesh Reshammiya ¬ñ Javed Akhtar pairing coming together for the first time (unfortunately not for the good). Himesh is as nasal as usual. But what's disappointing is that the usually dependable Javed Akhtar goes on to write inanities like 'Aanan Panan', 'Chakna Chakna' to 'Rafta Rafta'. And what exceptional work did the much-talked about international cinematographer Jonathan Bloom has done in this film that our desi cameraman from Ashok Mehta to Anil Mehta can't do? We are so used to Akshay Kumar's on screen comic image by now that whenever he attempts to do emotional roles, he ends up making a mockery of his own image. The only saving grace is Katrina Kaif who is immaculately beautiful throughout the film.In one of the dialogues of the film Katrina says, "I don't watch Hindi films". If Bollywood continues to churn more films like Namastey London, it won't be long when we all will be mouthing the same dialogue."
