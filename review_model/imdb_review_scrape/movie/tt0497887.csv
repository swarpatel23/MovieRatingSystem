" Whay kind of gin is that?","Bhola (Siraj Khan) leaves his same village to go live with his uncle in Mumbai. His uncle is a screenplay writer and his cousin is a director. He is a bit of an idiot and the banter between him and his cousin reminded me a little of Abbot and Costello with the short guy being Abbot. Bhola, who drinks is tea in Dolby sound, wants to be a movie star hero. His family appeases him by sending him to acting class and English speaking class as all Bollywood stars must be able to infuse English into their speech, even if they don't understand it. Bhola meets a pretty girl Raveena (Bharati Sharma) from the US who wants to be an actress, and she thinks he is an idiot.The humor mentions stars by specific names and I would imagine if one was familiar with the Bollywood scene, these would be funny lines. Instead we have to be satisfied with lines from a Bollywood star Kumar who says he will do a script on two conditions: One the title must begin with the letter "K" and secondly they change the plot. The actor then suggests "California" for the title.The film discusses how much American movies have borrowed from India. The humor is corny and much of it relies on similar sounding words which for some reason translated well into English. Some of the translation was rough: "I have earned very less in this industry." The production included only 2 musical numbers. As always the menu allows you just to select the songs.Parental Guide: No F-bomb or nudity. 2 people in bed, implied sex."
