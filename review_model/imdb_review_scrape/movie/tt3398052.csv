" Deliciously amazing!","Whenever we see a romcom, we expect something new but come out saying that it was the very mainstream one. But not with this one. It's an epic Romcom that also delivers a beautiful message which only few people will be able to receive. Its amazing to watch how two people get bonded over food. The script is phenomenal, dialogues are superb, directions are fab! Truly hats off! I mean, if you're looking forward for an amazing weekend, you should definitely book the tickets. Be it with your, lovers, friends, family whoever. You will thoroughly enjoy the 2.5 hours of watching the movie. I recommend to watch it in a good theater. Speaking of the cast, Parineeti Chopra, undoubtedly has done a FANTASTIC job, all over again in this one. Her very typical and desi Hyderabadi accent will WOW you! ARK was also good. Please go and watch the film. Its good to watch such talented actors on the big screen." 
" Delicious!!! A Must-watch feel good movie","Didn't expected much while moving in to watch. However,I loved the whole movie.Didn't felt bored even for a minute.It was entertaining throughly.a light-hearted comedy.good casting and acting.Both parineeti and Aditya were charming,they did well with their Hyderabadi-lucknowi accent and looked completely into the character.I mostly liked because of the story,which was quite different from the usual regular movies.It's not that it has just delicious food but it also has a binding story with a message.direction was good didn't stretched the movie,songs were not forced,after a long time watched a good Bollywood movie.A good one to watch with family" 
" Worth Watching it - A Modern society's cute love story","There is nothing new in this story, many people even can predict the movie, But still its worth watching. Acting of Pariniti and Aditya's are superb. Small small elements and dialogs are very nice. Movie is realistic and if you are still enjoying your lively love life, this is the movie you should watch. There is nothing new in story but it still holds you till the end. Thanks Bollywood for giving such nice movie. Its a nice play with very nice message, lot of fun and superb dialog delivery. Watch it with family, as there are very few movies now a day coming out from Bollywood for family. Direction and locations do not have anything special but they makes the realistic scenes and perfectly suites the movie." 
" A must watch!! will bring a big smile on your face....full on entertainment","Amazing acting, story and direction. Definitely one of the top 10 Bollywood films to watch if your a Bollywood lover. Its not the usual dragged love story. Aditya Roy Kapur is a complete delight to watch, if you loved him in Aashiqui 2 you'll love him even more in Dawat e Ishq. Parineeti and Anupam Kher were very good too (their Hyderabadi accents were very good). Karan Wahi makes a sweet guy entry with his first film. If your a foodie it will be even better for you. It is a sweet film with love, comedy, a good message, and its fun filled. You will definitely be smiling walking out of the theater. It wont harm you but definitely amuse you." 
" Fresh and Nice one to watch.","Daawat-e-Ishq- 2014 Director: Habib Faisal There is nothing new in this story, many people even can predict the movie, But still it's worth watching. Acting of Parineeti and Aditya's is superb. Small small elements and dialogs are very nice. Anupam Kher is a wonderful actor and he proves his mettle once again. He gets into the skin of character and supports the proceedings of movie with grace. Music is just amazing. Dawat-E-Ishq has a fresh and exotic aroma to appetite you.There will be many people who didn't like the film but I think you can watch this film with your family because the content is very clean and beautiful. Deliciously Amazing" 
" Great feel good movie","This is a fun movie to watch and completely entertaining. We loved how parineeti chopra and aditya roy kapoor acting. They are both natural and make the acting look effortless. Anupam kher is also great. The chemistry between Kher and pareeneta, as father Daughter duo is amazing well portrayed. Its a movie with a good social message as well. And a great display of social chemistry in India. Overall its a good and fun movie to watch. Indian cusine is also portrayed so well, never really done in any other movie i know. Well directed movie and a non-conventional storyline. This is a fun movie to watch and completely entertaining.

" A lajjatdaar recipe for love","The way to a woman's heart is also through her stomach - this twisty idea is enlivened by director Habib Faisal in his collaboration with Yash Raj banner flick, Daawat-E-Ishq which provides a spicy and eclectic romantic affair blending the cuisine culture of Hyderabad and Lucknow. Faisal is known for his penchant to craft authentic middle-class milieu with his rooted characters under the context of relevant social topics,and this time he examines the stigma of dowry practices which has maligned the institution of marriage, but in a lighter vein.Disillusioned with love and tired of matrimonial encounters with over-demanding prospective bridegrooms, Gulrez aka Gullu (Parineeti Chopra),an shoe-sales girl, hatches a con-plan to avenge her humiliations by duping them into fake marriage and imposing charges under section 498A of anti-dowry act. In that way, she can also get hefty sum of money to fulfill her long-nurtured 'American' dreams. She cajoles her resistant father, Bujji(Anupam Kher) an ordinary high court clerk who succumbs to her emotional blackmail. This leads them to Lucknow, where they stumble upon one of their 'bakras',Tariq Hyderi aka Taru(Aditya Roy Kapur) who happens to be an extraordinary cook. Taru is bowled by the feisty girl's charms ,and while Gullu gets gradually swooned by the aroma emanating from the Biryanis and Kababs of Taru's kitchen, their plan is thrashed sweetly by the blossoming love.It's a richly textured premise which offers us an irresistible array of starters , a somewhat delicious main course but the dessert spread turns out to be rather bland.Cutting through the colorful nuances of the city of Nizams, Hyderabad, the narrative also presents a warmth-filled camaraderie between the father and her daughter. The film's latter half dwells in the revelry of Lucknow and its rich culinary traditions which forms a canvas for the romance between its protagonists. The Blemishes - it suffers from logic issues. The climax looks hurried and doesn't convince us about Taru's sudden change of heart for Gullu.These lacunae are however washed off by the spirited performances of the film's central characters. Parineeti Chopra imbues Gullu with full radiance, sparkles and confidence. Its a comfort zone for her to be in her 'feisty' self, but the actress takes an extra leap to get her Hyderabadi diction impeccably right, a trait that was grossly goofed-up by the ace star Vidhya Balan in Bobby Jasoos. Anupam Kher's comical nervousness reminds us of his superbly staged act in Special 26, and he shines in all sequences requiring emotional gravitas. And most importantly, Aditya Roy Kapur makes a revelation, playing the revered restaurateur with a cocky delight. Dawat-E-Ishq has a fresh and exotic aroma to appetize you, but that doesn't last too long to tingle your taste buds." 
" Detoxifying Delicacy","In this festive season many big budgets movie are coming up with top stars, most of us are saving time and money for them. Frankly speaking despite a talented star cast I didn't had much expectation from this movie and was saving for future releases. The movie positively surprised me with the content, the delivery by the lead actors and overall execution. Daawat-e-Ishq is a tale of a young girl who is rejected by many grooms because she is unable to meet their dowry demands. She eventually makes a plan to find out the greediest groom and make him pay for it. The cast has put in great effort especially the lead cast. Though one may argue that Parineeti is used to doing loud characters, but the ease with which she carries off this role makes you crave for more . Aditya Roy Kapur's role is different from what he has played till now and frankly I can't think of any other actor who would have put more into the character than himself. Anupan Kher again proves to be a class act. Support cast, cinematography, editing are also good. One another good point in the movie is it never takes itself very seriously. Even some scenes which you would expect to be somber are lightly done, so it never loses the overall mood of the film. The dialogues and props also deserve a special mention for their ingenious humor and relevance. The only down point which I felt was the music which could have been better and have had leveraged the chemistry between the two lead actors. Also the movie slows down in part especially in the second half.Overall a good movie with a very important message. Miss it if you don't like light hearted, meaningful comedy. Otherwise take your family to this delightful treat you won't find it distasteful." 
" Taste is not up to mark of this dinner invitation","Director Mr. Habib Faisal work is OK. He enhanced the mood and scenes by some good shots. There was just an idea in the name of story. Idea is good but development is not. Screenplay offers nothing new. Dialogues by director himself are good and completely suits the mood of film. First half of the film is slow although sweet but second half is half cooked, slow and baseless. Incidents increased in second half but film slowed down because of not well justified scenes. I was unable to justify the first turn of movie that when the leads were aware about that Haidri Kebab is there target then why did they choose to go there? Climax action were not required at all and it looked very childish the way they executed it. Even the action sequence, when lead escaped with cash was complete non happening. Performance wise Parineeti Chopda is very good. Aditya Roy Kapoor is OK. Anupam Kher is fantastic. He uses his body language as a great tool to emote. Music by Sajid –Wajid is melodious and lyrics by Kausar Munir is good." 
" A bit of a bland feast.","Ever been for a meal to a place known for its quality fare and come away disappointed? We all have occasionally. Daawat-e-Ishq is one example of just such an outing. (YRF...some consistency will do wonders). The story-is of young Hyderabadi Gulrez (Parineeti Chopra in a too pink lipstick) whose prospects for "jahez" are limited and thus she gets no suitable boys-even when they seek her out and fall ostensibly in love with her. An indignant Gullu then hatches a plot which involves snaring a prize catch with promises of much dowry, conducting a false wedding ceremony and then slapping the anti-dowry Article 498 A on them to get them to cough up huge sums as damages-in or out of court. This with the help of her doting but dithery dad (Anupam Kher). Guls however reckons without the rustic but honest charm of Tariq Haider "Taru" (Adiya Roy Kapoor in shirts which would put Govinda to shame) from Lucknow. He is loud, brash and not much to look at but has great insight and also actually wants to marry for love and not money alone. He is also the scion of a family which owns a highly popular restaurant and thus the way to this woman's heart is definitely through her stomach. Between kababs, biryani, shahi tukda and phirni, their jalebi of a love story ferments and soaks up in the "chashni" of friendship and mutual liking. And throws her off her balance... The acting was mediocre across the board. Parineeti was bland and mechanical and did no justice to the chatpata role she had. The only surprise was Aditya Roy Kapoor who thankfully for once was NOT a washed up drunk and even conveyed a fair amount of emotion through surprisingly warm dark melted chocolate brown eyes. The Hyderabadi accents were OK but the Lucknow portrayals were not. Also, for some reason there was a surfeit of pink in the film-from lipstick to an all pink Holi. Two of the songs are lovely-the title track and the Sonu Nigam number- Mannat. Kausar Munir's lyrics impress yet again. Lovely words to be wooed with. The story or rather its enactment lacked depth and was oversimplified. (Excuse me a bit while I go plan my own heist---anyone know where I can get a fake passport made?). There are a few sizzling moments between the lead pair but not enough to make us go "yum". What are missing are the accurate characterisations of people and places as in "Ishaqzaade" or the unaffected spontaneity of "Do Dooni Chaar". These comparisons, though irksome, will be made as the quality of these films is unquestionable. With all the ingredients of a delicious meal (actors, director, producer, music) it fell short of seasoning." 
" Bland, half-cooked, half-hearted Dawat-e-Ishq","This movie seems like it was made in a hurry. A lot of loose ends, substandard performances by the cast and crew and lack of finesse in script, screenplay, characterization and direction is rampant.Nothing great about acting either. Anupam Kher, Parineeti Chopra, Aditya Roy - all appear to be themselves not the characters they are playing. Had Anupam and Parineeti, who play Hyderabadi characters, worked on Hyderabadi accent and style, it would have added a lot of value and amusement factor to the movie. Instead they've just said just 2-3 phrases, like putting "ich" in every other sentence to appear Hyderabadi. Parineeti is getting repetitive - same expressions, same demeanor in every movie.Aditya Roy Kapoor's character looks more like a buffoon and Karan Wahi acts so subdued as if scared of something.The movie is about the social-evil of dowry. How a girl and her father plan to get even on the dowry-mongers. But the "plan" is extremely childish, to say the least and is actually a plan to further bore the audience who are already half asleep. The lesser said about the two ludicrous "action" sequences, the better it would be.I had high expectations from Faisal Habib, he disappointed me. My advice - do not attend this dawat." 
" A nice movie that will make you smile","Daawat e Ishq was nice movie with a good social message, good performances from all actors. I'm a Parineeti fan so I went to see the film. But must say I like Aditya's acting even better. Some fabulous songs. The Hyderabad's accent is quite amusing. The story may be a bit Hindi movie style but then you should not look for logic everywhere. Doesn't revolve much around the food as you might guess from title. Aditya's acting was impressive. Parineeti acts good always n so does Anupam Kher. Title song and Mannat songs are very good and have become my favorite. The way both the songs have been pictured are beautiful. Overall a good movie experience at end of which you would come out with a smile." 
" Mixed Bag","Yashraj films is a banner that produces several films which mostly work but sometimes things don't work, They gave us crap films like Neal N Nikki. Daawat E Ishq releases in shortwhile after MARDAANI their last film which worked. The problem with the film is it's promoted as a romantic foodie comedy but the film is about dowry which is socially relevant but somehow things don't work out well, the entire change of identity and the scheme doesn't work out that well, even the romance seems hurried and could be better The ending too doesn't work out well,yet the film does have some good moments between the leads, also scenes between Anupam Kher and Parineeti are good but the film could be betterDirection by Habib Faizal is quite good though it pales front of his last film Ishaqzaade and Do Dooni Char. Music is decent, Meri Mannat is a superb song by Sonu Nigam, the title song is decent rest are okayAditya Roy Kapoor makes a good comeback after Aashiqui 2 and YJHD and thankfully he doesn't play drunk, he gets into his character skilfully and plays the part superbly Parineeti Chopra is superb however she is getting typecast Anupam Kher is simply outstanding and steals the scenes rest are all okay, Karan Wahi makes an okay debut" 
" Yummy","I like this movie; the acting was fab no one can deny that pari & ARK were awesome they've done an excellent job. While watching; for many times i forgot about ARK and see just taru as well pari she was soooooo great as always; for the music all songs were amaziiing ithink the movie lacks some spices in the storyline or it would have 9 or 10" 
" Acha good movie hai this Daawat-e-Ishq hahahah","All good about this Daawat-e-Ishq really enjoyed with fmly good work good acting and last is good luck" 
" Definitely worth a watch","This movie starts beautifully, and draws you in. Wonderful heartfelt performances, soulful and energetic music that fits with the Hyderabadi / Lucknavi cultures - this movie had a lot going for it.So what was missing? A heroine that one could root for, characters that were consistent. The father is an intelligent, poor, kind hearted typical Indian middle class soul who has spend decades walking the path of honesty and yet he suddenly flips and enthusiastically joins his daughter in her plan of crime because of an accident. This was not believable. The heroine was obnoxious - a poster child for everything that is wrong with the so-called new feminism. She is ill mannered, rude to guests, downright unethical, selfish, bordering on psychopath, the way she steals money from the hero without any compunction. It is only when she goes down the path a while, that she feels any repentance, which is too little, too faint and too late. And yet, just for the wonderful performance by all concerned, the beautiful direction, editing and cinematography, watch it. Movies like this should be supported - we have too little of these movies in the industry. Note to the team - next time, strengthen the script!"
