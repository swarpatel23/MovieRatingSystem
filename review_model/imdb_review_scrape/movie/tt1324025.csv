" Ridiculous, just plain dumb","The musical intro to the movie "Dus" was innovative, exciting, and sexy! Every movie since has tried to imitate it, most unsuccessfully. This one is no different. I think they forgot the one ingredient "Dus" had - really sexy men. Okay, so much for the intro - it gets worse from there. The acting is just so-so, the script is awful, and the plot line/premise is just plain dumb. When Kokila and Koena are attacking the men that attempted to molest Mili and Julie, the action was so poorly choreographed that it would pass for (bad) dancing, not fighting. There are so many incidents of "nonsense coincidences" in the movie that it strains the imagination and hurt my brain. Munnu and Pappu are annoying and irresponsible, and you actually start to root for the police every time they are arrested. I gave this film a "2" because there was one point where I laughed out loud, but it was so unmemorable that I can't think of the scene. Not great review for a comedy, just skip it." 
" Great potential comedy becomes huge disappointment","What do you do when you have a good story for a great comedy? Well, I would say you make the best of it, and create a blockbuster. The story altogether has many possibilities: two women are forced to get married if they want to inherit their father's money and estate, two girls are forced to get married after having made a mess of every introduction to possible candidates, and two guys on the run for pretty much the same reasons.The "gay-issue" plays a part in this movie, although you have to read between the lines at times, and not assume that the writer only used it to create funny moments. Nevertheless, what happens is that the bad sound, the terrible translation for the English subtitles, and especially the bad acting of several of the actors make this a disaster.And that is really a pity, cause the story has much potential. Let's hope someone takes the same story for a better make-over some day!"
