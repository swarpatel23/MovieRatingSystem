" Realistic and wonderful movie","This movie was excellent. It was a truly adult theme and very realistically made. This genre of movies has not been explored in India because of social taboos but it happens all the time. People fall in & out of love, they may never be 'in-love' with their spouse but think they do and keep looking for a deep romantic love. This movie explored all this with tenderness & dignity as the dominant themes. What's more, it was not primitive in it's treatment of the story i.e. the previous tone for movies would have been to kill these people who fall in love outside of marriage or suddenly turn their spouses into abusing monsters - to justify the people falling in love - who die and bless the new couple in the dying scene to be together! The movie had a realistic and logical conclusion. The only thing is that it could have been shorter. Nevertheless, it was not boring. All the actors have given it their best shot." 
" Karan hits a new low","Kabhi "kank" na dekhnaa!! This movie had the best ending of any BW film I've seen. The only way to improve on the ending of this film would have been to move it 190 minutes closer to the beginning.I must congratulate KJ on blending unsympathetic, whiny, self-absorbed characters with a convoluted, self-indulgent and incredibly overblown storyline. I should also thank him for making me think kindly of Mother India, which now seems like a 10 minute comic riot when compared to this month-long episode of "Hamare Zindagii ke dinoN". I was easily able to understand how desperation to get out out of it caused Big B to have a heart attack. Talk about life imitating art! Still, it must have been less painful than being stuck in the nightmare of that movie. The guy is well-read, thoughtful and well-spoken off screen, but is painted a sleazy lecher in the first 45 minutes of this film. When Preity says "this marriage is over", my only reaction was "but this movie's still got 40 minutes to go!" Poor Kajol should have avoided this stinker like the plague, opting for classy, high-quality drama like "Girlfriend" instead.I now have a soft spot for Preity, and hope that starring in this clunker doesn't weigh her down with too much bad karma. Now I'm off to do pooja for whichever deity inspired the FF button, to say thanks for preventing my suicide." 
" Experiment gone awry","I make onion poha for breakfast thrice a week, with the bare minimum ingredients possible. One day I tried to experiment some (inspired by the stalls outside my Engineering college) and tried some sugar (caramelized onions anyone?), extra turmeric and some red chilli powder. The result was anything but edible but I humbly gulped it down.KANK is an honest attempt to break away from the mauled of sugary romances by the new age love guru Karan Johar. An honest attempt, huh? Its the result that speaks volumes in the age of fast-food and fast-love. What we get to witness this time is not the time tested elaborate shaadis, karwa chauths or the big fat Indian family reunions, reminiscent of his and Yash "uncle's" earlier movies. This time its the bold subject of infidelity - the sensitive (ahem!) portrayal of seeking love outside a loveless (???) marriage. How far does Karan succeed? Lets check it out through the eyes of a neutral, unassuming viewer.KANK is the story about Dev (Shahrukh), a footballer whose career dreams are broken along with his leg when he meets with a freak accident, which makes him a recluse. His ever complaining ways puts his marriage with Rhea (Priety), a successful woman, on the rocks. In another part of New York city, there is marital tension between Rishi (Abhishek), & Maya (Rani) for reasons only known to Karan dude. Maya is a cleanliness freak and doesn't know why she is married to Rishi even after 4 years being together. She thinks that she is trapped in a loveless marriage, whereas her hubby still goes ga-ga over her. In the midst of all this mayhem, we have the swinging sexagenarian Sam (Big B) who could be the poster boy for Viagra and Dev's endearing mom played by Kirron Kher.Its baffling to comprehend the first meeting between the protagonists Dev & Maya on the latter's wedding day and the subsequent exchange of words between total strangers. She is confused about the marriage right from the word go due to godforsaken reasons. Cut to the present times and the duo meet up under similarly make-belief circumstances. The sequences revolving around a bizarre character "Black Beast" is corny to the core (now I wish I had seen Krrish!). The first half is laced with incoherent scenes like these, barring a few. The screen lights up whenever Big B is there, he provides the much desired light-hearted moments. His tete-a-tete with Kirron Kher is quite funny.Well, coming back to the crux of the movie, the protagonists become pally, meet up regularly and discuss ways to save their crumbling marriages. At this point, Karan dude goes over the top again and gives us the work which resembles that of an overzealous amateur. The scenes where Maya teaches Dev the art of giving a good massage in a furniture store and Karan trying it on his wife and Maya metamorphosing into a seductive hunterwaali clearly takes the movie to abysmal levels. Then the inevitable happens, the duo become too close for comfort and decide to cheat on their respective spouses - what set out as mending work created a bigger monster.Now lets talk about the performances, which forms the most important aspect of a Karan Johar movie as he employs the best in the industry. Shahrukh plays the role of Dev with conviction and nobody else could have bettered him here, but hey wait a minute, haven't I seen the same expressions in half a dozen of his earlier movies? Rani is competent but one hardly tends to sympathize with her character inspite of crying a bucketful. Abhishek Bachchan is the surprise packet, he goes through a range of emotions as if he is already a veteran, great acting from the junior. Priety looks glamorous and in a couple of scenes manages to overshadow king Khan too, but was that cleavage show necessary? Kirron Kher too does a great job but its Big B who again proves yet again that he is the real king and this time he gives a certain Mr.Hashmi a run for his money. He is ice cool in the first half and philanthropic towards the latter stages.All said and done, the stellar cast raises the bar of the movie but then to what extent? A movie with such a half baked plot and treatment can't be saved from the obvious, it disappoints. The screenplay leaves a lot to be desired and that poses a question in front of Karan dude - Is it really worth to break away from the mauled? An ardent fan of his movies would be satisfied watching the protagonists running around trees and mustard fields and elaborate traditional celebrations of filthy rich families.Nowadays I make onion pohas with a dash of lemon and they taste just fine. I guess I've learnt that the right way of making it by pondering over my mistakes, without going overboard with experimentation. Good luck Mr Johar!" 
" very disappointing","Karan,I wait for your new releases anxiously but this one was disappointing.It was not that the whole concept was bad,but it could have been better.There were very negative elements in the movie which i think were not taken care off.Dev had been shown as a bad father because he is always found his son scolding and even at the end he prefer his selfishness instead of his child.If Maya could not be happy with such a good husband then she will be never satisfied with anyone else,cos there is not a single reason shown in the movie which shows that Dev can love her more than Rishi.I feel that Riya and Rishi were very good pair for two of them and still they wanted something more.Till the end of the movie Maya and Dev have not realized their mistake.Dev's mother preferred living with Riya ,his son is happy with his mom and doesn't miss his father anymore,Rishi compromised marrying again to fill the emptiness in his life and these two selfish characters are happy in the end disturbing so many lives.If end would have been shown as realizing what blunder they did and would have shown cared for their family,it could have win audience applause,Rishi and Riya were not at all wrong instead both of them were so lovable then why they had to undergo from such a pain?It could have been a hit if the story line would have been better." 
" Most overrated film","Saddest take on extra marital relationships. No justification for anything. Why SRK falls for Rani? How is she so different from Preity? Why is Rani angry with Abhishek? What does SRK give her? There is no justification and as a viewer I do not get interested in any relationship whatsoever. Because nothing looks real. One does not feel any emotions and the stars are crying all the time! Everything looks artificial and concocted. The director does not seem to have any depth and any understanding of the sensitivities. One should have a look at Arth and Silsila to see how this kind of cinema should be attempted. Good locations and costumes do not make up for an atrocious film." 
" Please do not watch this movie","Watch it only if your life depends on it. Perhaps. In a country where millions of people are living below the poverty line, are dying of curable diseases like malaria, living like rats and dying like flies ... making movies (even bad ones) about rich, confused, NRI a**h***s is not only pointless but OUTRIGHT WRONG. Or may be it is not such a bad idea after all - "if they have no bread, let them eat cake". This movie can be described by these words - TORMENTING, TORTUROUS, HORRIBLE, EXCRUCIATING, AGONIZING, HARROWING, PAINFUL, TORTUROUS and MIND-NUMBING. Also sitting through this movie proves that there is something seriously wrong with me and that I should reevaluate my life." 
" Lack of focus and conviction","So, how do we make movie.Step 1: Start from an idea Step 2: ... No point going to this step and onwards because that's where the thinking part ends in this case.The idea was good, different and definitely unconventional. The execution was flawed and suffered from lack of thinking and complete inability to knit a story around that idea.Let's start with lack of identity in and relevance of characters: Sam - couldn't figure out why is this character in the movie. He could not resolve anything, could not set an example of any kind. If he is trying to be Hugh Hefner, so be it - don't mix or dilute that character with stints of love for his late wife.Kamaljit - Such a fine actress - totally wasted because of the same issue as above.Maya - why is she unhappy? is she very fond of cleaning and Rishi very fond of throwing trash around; she wants to do or achieve something in life that Rishi is not letting her to? is she in love with some other guy before marriage (like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam) and she is stuck here? Not explained at all in the movie.Dev - Why is he so irritated all the time? What does he want in life? Why does he feel bad when Rhea kind of shows her generosity when she declines the promotion but he makes sarcastic remarks when he wins some small time cup in the beginning of the movie but she is unable to make it because of her interview? His love towards Maya all these years (even though he was married) and his waiting or letting the trains go, keeping a close watch at her etc. comes as a big surprise to the audience as well (at least tell us about it so that we can at least appreciate and understand your character and try to defend you.. because ultimately it is going to be your story)? How was he wronged to an extent that he had to leave his son, his mother because of some Maya after more than 5 years of marriage? What led him to pull the chain in the end when he didn't even know that Maya wasn't living with Rishi anymore? Totally confused guy with no sense of life.Rhea - Understood. She is a career oriented woman and work comes first and family second. That's a personal choice and I appreciate that. She is very successful and took the magazine to No. 1 spot in less than 2 years (she joined when her son was 5yrs old). But her way of dealing with personal situations is very immature - don't believe she played any role in dealing with people issues to make the magazine such a big success. And what was the meaning of - Now we are No. 1 and now let us go back to our husbands and family. Are you saying that leaving husbands and family was part of the project plan to bring the magazine to No. 1 spot and that now there will not be any effort to keep it that way. Trust me, fight for sustenance at No. 1 spot is far more hard than achieving it.Rishi - The most reasonable character in the movie. Although we don't know what is going on in his mind and how he wants to resolve things than just being totally committed and in love with Maya..but still.. we can grant him some room.Arjun - A cute little angel with Chicken Little looks. He could have played a significant role in the movie to turnaround things and situations. But he is a kid...he gets to suffer in the end...so let us leave him for now.In short - if we have so many weak characterizations playing the lead role in the movie, howsoever good the concept is - it is bound to fail.The only good thing in the movie (that is why 1 star) 1- Music. Great Music!! But the songs, lyrics and the situations were totally out of sync with the storyline.Mr. Johar - I have been a big fan of yours and I am sure you know this but I don't know why you missed it this time - There's a lot that goes into a movie to make it watchable than designer dresses, new york streets, and the most expensive and talented set of actors in Indian film industry. Please take charge of the movie and understand your responsibility and accountability to get the best out of them. This is not a Karan Johar movie - this is a movie that happens to have Karan Johar's name as the director." 
" A disappointing rendering of a sensitive emotion","Hello Karan, This one's for you...Did you know that extra marital affairs or relationships are NOT built on flimsy grounds. It takes a lot of courage, pain, thought, guilt, yes, no, yes, no and finally when the partners give in (particularly when both are married) there is a lot of intensity, commitment to each other and hidden emotions which are so strong that you start to "feel" even if you are a listener/counselor/friend/confidante.. So just imagine how deep such a bond is, when it breaks the fetters of society. I am surprised that a person of your SENSITIVITY handled this theme with such a casual attitude.... And SRK who is at his emotive best in other films just lazily glides through this... as if the entire gamut of emotions is happening to someone else.. and Rani was a BAD choice despite her histrionic talents she could not handle this one... Kajol would have been better...since the basic rendering of the theme was so poor and disappointing, the characters did not depict any sensitivity/intensity/guilt/reason for an affair... no point in going into other cinematic content... it is a long awaited but disappointing finale..Study human relationships next time... before you venture into adult stuff..Good Luck anyways" 
" Beginning of the end..","The storyline is weak. It lacks a good foundation to build a good plot...though I am glad that Karan Johar took the initiative to break out of his routine-happy-movies...he definitely missed the mark. Could this be the beginning of the end for him?....The content was unconvincing, fake and unreal. There is no justification for any of their actions, namely Maya (Rani) and Dev's (SRK). To put it simply...it's just something the general audience will not be able to digest.The backdrop is all too familiar with Kal Ho Na Ho and the songs aren't that great either. The film felt like it was on a never-ending roundabout...so much could've been edited and so much of it was unnecessary...felt like I was in the theatre for ages. BUT... nonetheless, I personally think the acting was satisfactory- and that goes for Preity, Rani, Abhishek, ..and maybe even SRK.I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be a big flop." 
" Don't waste your money.","This is possibly the most advertised and well promoted movie in a long time. It has more stars than can be seen on most nights from Gurgaon. It is supposedly the most expensive Indian film made with a budget of over 70 Crore (~ USD 15 million) most of which might have gone towards paying the stars. The songs have been repeated tiresomely on the TV music channels and the radio channels. It has been one of the most awaited for movies in a long time, with advance bookings opening on Wednesday for the Friday show. We were among those who managed to get tickets for this weekend. So how was it? Awful.The story. Dev Saran, a football champion, breaks his leg in an accident and becomes a good-for-nothing, while his wife Rhea is a successful magazine editor. Insecurities abound and he is always in a bad mood. Rishi Talwar is a suave party planner, while his wife Maya is a teacher who can't have kids. More insecurity abounds, and she is always sad. The movie was supposed to be about relationships. It was supposed to offer insights into dealing with the situation of finding your soul mate after you are married. If it had stuck to this plot it would have been a good movie. I am no expert at relationships, but in this case I can confidently say I have more insight than Karan Johar or any of the cast and crew of this movie. Karan's first mistake was to showcase the two couples as struggling in marriage. This is unnecessary. A couple can be perfectly happy in marriage and yet find someone else to be their soul mates. This would have a much more difficult situation. His second mistake was to give both protagonists Dev, and Maya a weakness, or insecurity. This is the basis of their relationship and is totally flawed to begin with. Why could they have not been normal people who find interesting things in each other rather than comfort for their insecurities? Karan's third mistake was one that all Indian directors seem to make and I am beginning to believe is probably part of Indian upbringing now. People only listen to their elders on their death bed. On Samarjit's (Rishi's dad) last wish, Maya and Dev confront their partners and tell them the truth. But after being kicked out, they lie to each other, hoping to gain some sympathy with the audience for being nice. Unfortunately letting 3 years pass till you are accidentally reunited is not true love, or soul mate material, so oops, missed again. There were other characters and plot lines, something about a child kidnapping Black Beast, a friendly tie-up between the Hugh Hefner with Indian morals Samarjit (Sam) and Kamaljit (Dev's mom) and a really weak link between Rhea and her boss at the magazine, but none of them were necessary. The acting. Shah Rukh (Dev) is the worst. His list of expressions is reducing from movie to movie and he is better off playing roles with very little facial expression needed like Swades. Preity Zinta (Rhea) had no role so no scope for acting. She looked good yes, but if that's all that was required of the role, then someone like Malika would have been enough. Rani Mukherjee (Maya) was all gloss and at a loss for any kind of emotion. Maybe the make up was too constricting and all too obvious with the fake tears literally rolling effortlessly down her cheeks. A below par performance for a critically acclaimed actress. Abhishek (Rishi) was the saving grace. He is maturing into a fine actor. Granted his character was also the most real of the entire cast, but he managed to use that to his advantage and got the audience, me, to feel sorry for him. Amitabh, the playboy, should retire, his wrinkles just too scary for big screen. Kiron Kher was OK. Arjun Rampal, Kajol, John Abraham and Saira Mohan were wasted. So a big plus for Bachchan Junior and huge negative for everyone else. The Cinematography and music Too repetitive. I got bored of seeing the NY skyline, something I never thought was possible. Columbia University and the station were overused. If this was really a story about relationships it might as well have been shot in Fursatganj. Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy under deliver. Gone are the days of Dil Chahta Hai or even Bunty Aur Babli. In General The first half deserves a 1 star rating while the second probably a 2. One other thing, I was uncomfortable with is the film rating. It was a U/A. I saw lots of kids in the theatre and am not sure how this movie got a U rating. Is it okay for kids to know about kinky sex these days? Omkara got an A rating and I would rather kids see that than this. Maybe that was his biggest mistake  making this movie suitable for everyone and not concentrating on the adult audience. Definitely not worth spending money on this one. http://iamnovip.blogspot.com/" 
" Loved this Movie!","If you enjoy watching Bollywood movies about relationships especially real life marital relations, I think this movie is worth watching. At any rate, Karan Johar had courage to make this film and made it intensely serious as well as adding good comedy at the right moments. The songs are enjoyable and the performances by all the main actors were superb. It takes courage to take on the topic of infidelity and Johar does so brilliantly. We can relate to the characters on some level. It was wonderful to see the father-son team of Amitabh and Abishek team up in their mostly comic scenes. Shah Rukh Khan does intensity very well. Even though many Bollywood movies love to play with the idea that the couple that starts out in a movie isn't the couple that will end up together at the end, most Bollywood movies give it a fairy tale type ending where everybody is happy with the end result. But KANK does good by showing that there are repercussions when following your heart, and it doesn't feel good when we break another person's heart. This movie really explores the emotions and dilemmas that are involved in extra-marital affairs which I think is important for people to explore. Keep making these great films Karan!" 
" dismal","I had not watched the movie till lately.But unfortunately had to watch it.And i got so disgusted that i had to search for the site, become a member to post the comments! Because if by any chance it reaches the makers of the movie, i want to tell them that it was a sheer waste of money and energy, and should not be repeated in a country like ours! First of all, the movie is shot in foreign location when according to the story there is absolutely no need for doing that. The makers are clearly aiming at the overseas audience who will appreciate anything and everything in the name of India..not their fault.I don't want to write much about the flaws of the movie as a lot of people have already done that on this very site. However, what is worth mentioning is that the concept was very good n could have been a very good movie.. The problem is that the protagonists are not normal people with normal problems n expectations. They are on the wrong stand through out and so manage to gather no sympathies what-so-ever. It is also impossible to identify with these people and therefore we don't feel like crying every time they cry(which happens way too often) instead, towards the end, every time they break into tears, we feel like yawning.Shahrukh Khan could not have been worse, Rani was wasted and Amitabh Bachchan was disappointing beyond limits. Preity Zinta kept a straight face throughout, i know not why!! All in all, a sensitive topic completely wasted. Only one message to the makers, the audience is not so naive anymore.. it takes a lot more to make a good movie than huge mansions, designer clothes, half clad white women in 2 or 3 party songs, and dozens of bottles of glycerin. You can do much better than this. And if the promos of your next movie are remotely on these lines, i really wonder if Karan Johar will remain Karan Johar anymore, who can attract crowds only by his name." 
" A big disappointment...","Normally my expectations for Karan Johar movies are very high, but I am really disappointed this time, because the plot of the movie is very bad and very boring. There are no great and sudden scenes in the movie. Everything goes slow and expected. You can guess the climax of the movie from the every start. There are no trills, no excitement, no surprises. There is just a couple of dramatic scenes and that is all. I don't know why Karan Johar has decided to tell the story in this boring style, but there is just one thing I can say to him right now: "DUDE, YOUR MOVIE SUCKS" I will definitely try not to get fooled by trailers of a movie further on." 
" A good attempt flawed beyond belief","Storyline # 1 - Dev Saran (SRK) is a football champ who breaks his leg in a freak car accident and retains a permanent limp. He is married to Rhea (Zinta) and has a child. His insecurity lies in the fact that he could not achieve what he wanted to in life. But what makes it worse is the fact that he seems to hate that his wife, on the other hand, is the 'man of the house' while he lives off her. This makes him terminally ill with 'male chauvinism syndrome' as it were as he huffs and puffs his way across this 3.5 hour debacle.Cut to storyline # 2. Maya (Rani) a humble school teacher is married to Rishi (Abhishek) who is a party planner in NYC and a childhood friend of Maya. Maya is shown as someone incapable of having children and a cleanliness freak.Both marriages are on the rocks thanks to inexplicably unreasonable characters Dev and Maya. Dev is always mad about one thing or another without a break. I was wondering why Rhea stuck it out with as long as she did. On the other hand we have Mrs.Weepy-Eye Maya who never really explains why it is she cant satisfy her honest husband's genuine needs. If he requires a little passion in bed then she would rather 'discuss' it than do anything more. Needless to say the man is patient and puts up with this borderline insane woman.Then we have Rishi's Playboy dad Sam (Amitabh) who is waltzing around with girls a quarter his age while mouthing sentimental stuff about his dead wife. Yawn! When Dev and Maya meet the first time, being the strangers that they are, Dev actually manages to have a profound conversation with this complete stranger with questions like "Do you love him?" Seems like Johar was so eager to let them get used to each other from the very first frame and realism apparently doesn't matter anymore. A few meaningless lines later off goes Maya into her bridal suite and off goes Dev into a passing car.4 years pass by. Don't worry. That means nothing.Takes one to meet and understand one indeed. Dev and Maya meet up again due to some random accident and voila! We have the two couples exchanging greetings with each other. When they both "realize" that they are in the same boat they decide to help each other out with some ridiculous tomfoolery around beautiful NYC. You will have to see these scenes to hate them.A few songs and hip shakes later we have the couple checking into a suite somewhere as they have just realized that "Hey! We don't need to fix our marriages. Lets fix each other up with one another!' while poor old Abhishek and good old Zinta are gyrating in a night club somewhere oblivious of where exactly the "party is that night".KANK is about relationships outside marriage and what happens if one were to say 'meet their soul mate' after marriage. Very noble indeed. But the flaw is not with the question but with the answers Johar Inc. provides. Neither are they reasonable nor believable as 3.5 valuable hours of our finite lives are exhausted in this meaningless merry-go-round of 'relationships'.Performances hands down belong to the Bachchans. If you thought you had seen the last of Big B then you better watch out. Despite being borderline vulgar the legend pulls off an amazingly new and refreshing role of a Casanova. In the same breathe there is his kiddo Abhishek. In the entire cast he seemed the only dude who had any honesty in his performance. If there is anyone to benefit from this Titanic of a movie then that is Abhishek. Ranihang on. I forget when it was she acted in the movie between all that crying! Good lord woman! Have some integrity for crying out loud! Preity is OK in her very reserved appearance although I felt more sympathetic for her and Abhishek towards the end than these 'love birds'.I kept SRK for a different paragraph for a couple of reasons. This man needs to start rethinking doing movies for Johar. He has hammed like you have never seen before. If in Kal Ho Na Ho he wouldn't diethen in KANK he doesn't live. Not for one minute. His loud and over the top acting makes me wonder if he indeed was the man who made a classic like Swades. It's a shame his choices have gone downhill again.Music is truly over rated since it sounds like a lot of tunes you have already heard before. Editing and camera work is more on NYC rather than scenes. How many times will we get to see NYC, Mr. Johar? Some of us live there you know.All said and done KANK is a good attempt gone very wrong. My advise  skip it and save yourselves a few hours of your mental and physical health." 
" I didn't like it","I watched this film as soon as it came out purely because my brother was dying to see it.Shah Rukh Khan should never have agreed to act in this film nor should Rani Mukherjee. They must have been desperate for the cash.It was AWFUL, never would happen in real life. Music was dreadful. I left an hour early because it dragged so much.I just felt ashamed for even watching this film.Would not recommend at all.Save your money and spend it on something useful like a pencil so that you can poke your eyes out instead of watching this film." 
" Fantastic film, and a bold attempt","before seeing this film , i had great fears about what could Karan Johar do this time( hated k3g). I was pleasantly surprised actually, i was pretty shocked how this is a total different director from the days of k3g. this film is bold( in terms of social norms in India), it says that the institution of marriage shouldn't be a rigid structure where people feel trapped by it. The thing I like about this film , is that you can't hate anybody in this film, everyone of the 4 main characters has moments when you love them and sympathize with them, and other moments where you want to smack them for their idiocy. i loved the comedy in the first half, and loved the drama in the 2nd half. the film has also high production values, the music is superb,the locations are amazing and Anil Mehta cinematography is top notch as usual.the film is little lengthy( which I didn't care about), and it could use some editing...otherwise, this was a very entertaining , thought provoking film that i didn't expect from Karan Johar."
