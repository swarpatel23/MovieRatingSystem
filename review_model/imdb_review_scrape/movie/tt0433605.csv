" Innovative movie with a good story","Naach is an incredible story. I liked it, as I have all RGV movies. It is based in the reality of human emotion and not just the heightened emotions of technicolor love stories, although I like those movies too. Antara Mali and Abhishek are a great pair. Wonderful performances. And the cinematography is great, fantastic-- superb. I liked that this film is set in the world of Bollywood. Everyone knows it is a hard business, but this illustrates the struggle of these artists without being schmaltzy. The dancing is so abstract, but I admired it. Some songs I fast forwarded through because they slowed the film down. The dialogue is good and I recommend the film as long as you can control the remote. Ritesh Deshmukh also gives a great performance." 
" Large canvas of beauty!","There are movies and there are MOVIES. Similarly, there are Ramgopal Varma creations and then there is NAACH! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, NAACH is Varma's best work till date. Agreed, the story is weak, the proceedings not quite comprehensive and the climax(to put it mildly) unconvincing and rushed. But then, this movie is not about story or characters. It is about Ramgopal Varma and his style of film-making. Varma has always defied the norms of Bollywood with his craft of the cinema. He refuses to crowd his movies with unnecessary song and dance routines, slapstick comedy, logic-defying action and most importantly, excessive melodrama. He doesn't play to the gallery at all! That is the reason why his 'SATYA' is still considered the most hard-hitting portrayal of the dark underbelly of the Mumbai underworld. His characters(SHOOL, AB TAK CHAPPAN) are just as believable and real as the person you cross roads with! His camera-work(KAUN, JUNGLE) is ever inventive and his editing(COMPANY), groundbreaking. And what is perhaps most surprising about this maverick film-maker is the frequency at which he keeps churning out movie after movie. And in doing so, he has created a niche audience for himself that waits for his films with earnestness! NAACH is Varma's tribute to this niche audience of his! Actually, NAACH is Varma's argument against all that is practiced in Bollywood which he would like to overthrow!NAACH is artistic masturbation at its best! And I have always been for artistic masturbation. GAJAGAMINI is one of the most criminally ignored films! The best works of Goddard, Almodovar and Tarkowsky have flowed(no pun intended) from labours of artistic masturbation. NAACH is Varma fantasizing about his vision of cinematic splendor and justifying his style of cinema. Therefore, in this process of presenting an artistic argument, the story and characters become collateral! And hence, inconsequential!NAACH then revolves around the lives of Abhinav(Abhishek Bachchan) and Reva(Antara Mali). Abhinav is a struggling actor and Reva an aspiring choreographer. Both intent on making it in the world of Bollywood. But their ideologies are different. Abhinav has no problems subscribing to the accepted to make his name, inspite of the fact that he resents formula cinema himself. Reva, on the other hand, wants to revolutionize the style of dance and music. Obviously, the idealist takes a long time to climb the ladder while the pragmatic reaches there instantly. But despite the success, Abhinav craves for the company of Reva. What Varma establishes here is the dormant yet inherent desire inside every actor to satisfy his creative and artistic urges that no amount of money and fame can satiate! In telling the stories of Abhinav and Reva, Varma also informs us about the machinery of Bollywood that governs what is produced and what is rebuked! Star-tantrums, artistic differences and egoistic upheavals determine the outcome of the final product. Reva(a play on Ramgopal Varma's initials- RV) is Varma's personification of his idea of beauty and cinema. Just as she defies the conventional style of dance, Varma uses her body to define grace. In fact, in every contour of her body, Varma shows us true beauty. So pure are his metaphorical references, that none of the scenes can be thought perverse. If people find this movie vulgar, then every sculpture at Khajuraho and Elephanta and every painting at Chola temples are vulgar too!There is a scene in the movie when Ritesh Deshmukh tells Antara Mali that her ideas are ahead of her times. Ironically, so is this movie! NAACH is unlike any Varma movie, but it is about Varma movies! Go see it, and devour this large canvas of beauty!Rating- ****** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent" 
" Naache Antara Mali","'Naach' is among the last positive outcomes of Ram Gopal Verma's experimental phase when he still offered good movies before he delivering one disaster after another. The film is by no means perfect and comparisons to 'Rangeela' and 'Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon' will be made. However, all three movies are treated differently and have their own unique presentation. 'Rangeela' is a musical fantasy about girl's dream of becoming a movie star. 'Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon' is a dramedy about an ordinary girl struggling to become a star. 'Naach' is about two characters: an idealistic Reva, who is deeply passionate about her art and wants to explore that, by her own means, through films; and a practical Abhinav whose ambition is to gain fame and wealth by becoming a superstar. The lead character/s in all three movies have one destination, films. It is the varying journey that makes each film unique.Ram Gopal Verma's direction is quite interesting. He uses washed out colours throughout the film except during the songs. The songs are well executed, colourful and energetic. The choreography is remarkable and the soundtrack is awesome. The pacing of 'Naach' is slow at times. Verma seems to have an Urmila hangover which is evident in how he portrays Antara in some sequences. Instead of allowing Antara to bring out her own sensuality (which is evident in the first songs, in the rehearsal scene and a few more song sequences), he pretty much 'dresses her up' like 'Rangeela's Mili in the song sequences. Verma has a fascination for shooting scenes from different angles and here he uses his cameraman well.A major fault of 'Naach' lies in the casting of Abhishek Bachchan. The actor does not convince at all. His dialogue delivery lacks spontaneity. His facial expressions look forced. He lacks energy which was required in the song sequences. Some fault also lies in the way the character is portrayed. Abhinav is not very likable and one would not expect Reva to take him back so easily after he unceremoniously dumps her (because she refuses to accept his help) when she is most in need of emotional support and now, after she has made a name for herself, he's crawling back in tears. Even Reva's dialogue about 'recognizing the Abhinav she met in the bus' seems stale and nonsensical. I did not want Reva to end up with Abhinav but what bothers me more was how an intelligent, smart and headstrong woman like Reva is portrayed to easily forgive because of a few tears. Ritesh Deshmukh is wooden.The heart of 'Naach' is Antara Mali. This is her film. She immerses herself entirely into Reva and captures her essence, passion, strength, courage and stamina with grace and elan. In addition to being a natural beauty and owning a fascinatingly flexible body, she is a terrific dancer. Perhaps is is her spirited performance that makes Abhishek's acting worse.'Naach' has its disappointments but for me, Antara Mali, the execution of the songs and some notable sequences made it worth watching. I wouldn't mind a revisit." 
" Artistically impressive but overly serious and slow","Not much to say about Naach. It is an endearing story of two strangers who meet each other and learn to know each other through the art of dance. The film is beautifully shot, and the making is inspiring and intelligent. Abhishek and Antara give spirited, restrained and realistic portrayals. The film however is very slow and the development of the story is a bit stretched and long. It doesn't make the film uninteresting, but it significantly reduces its level of appeal and creates some disturbing aspect to it. Nonetheless, Naach is a quality film that perfectly gives expression to the talent and the unique style of Ram Gopal Varma, and it should not be missed. Go for it!" 
" Not bad","Even if Naach doesn't stand a chance against the other 2004 Diwali releases, in it's own way, Naach is a decent fare. Ram Gopal Varma has again courageously attempted a completely different subject. Cinematography is fantastic, and Antra Mali's dance sequences have been shot brilliantly. I love almost all the songs in this album. The biggest flaw in this movie is that it doesn't really have a story. Even the little paragraph on the back of the DVD cover only describes the characters. The movie just attempts to develop the characters, which it does an excellent job. Antra Mali is coming in way too many films, and she is getting annoying. Abhishek has acted quite well. Ritesh Deshmukh was hard to recognize. He has also performed well." 
" Naach my cup of tea","In most parts a lethally dull venture, Naach is about this dancer/choreographer (Antara Mali) who regards herself as some kind of auteur, beyond the petty commercial compromises that people around her, including her actor beau (Abhishek Bachchan) build their careers on. Nice idea, only it turns out that she has the most howlariously bad concepts about costumes and dance movements, stuff rotten enough to make even the forces behind those ultra-cheap South Indian potboilers squirm in severe embarrassment.The story follows a yawn-inducing predictable pattern...dancer and beau meet and have an affair (yes, sex included)...beau gets success, but she spurns his attempts to help her...beau throws attitude and they walk out on each other...dancer meets a most unlikely director who wants her 'to do what she wants'...incongruous effort bags even more incongruous popularity...beau's attempts to reach out are rebuffed until a climax where he bursts out about how he can't live without her...D-uh end.Actually I didn't really expect this film to be much good. So why did I watch it? Because I have an Antara Mali fetish. She's an actress with IMO sufficient talent to reach grand heights provided she has the opportunity. Alas, her role in the film looks far better on paper than in actual execution, ironic for a film that's supposed to be about an uncompromising character. To give her credit she puts in a game effort, shining well in the few scenes that actually ask of her as an actress. I just wish the movie had been more worthy of her. Abhishek Bachchan also throws in a few good punches, the last scene salvaged somewhat by a simmering turn which pleasantly reminds you of his father.Only recommended if you can sit through humongous piles of dogcrap for the return of a few grains of good moments courtesy the lead actors." 
" A Man's Film","Good dancer, great flexible body with all the right curves in all the right places: why not make a whole film out of it?This is a POOR excuse for a film: a weak plot, appalling acting, scarce dialogue and even the dancing is not exceptional. All these MINOR considerations set the stage for the true purpose of the film: the female body. Not in a good way, but in a filthy way you can imagine a perverted old man enjoying (just like the one in the film ironically).The whole film is a collection of agonizingly slow sequences of dance, that clearly emphasize the BREASTS, which are either plainly on view, or at the centre of the screen or shown through skin-tight extremely short tops. The LEGS also have ample screen presence in all their various positions: open, closed, stretched, bent, crossed,...the film was long enough to try all the possible combinations.Sadly, the actress had no facial expression, but she made made up for it with her body talk.The film went even further by accentuating the genital area with either the conveniently designed costumes or the strategic placing of hands. At one point there were also explicit body movements and the dancer reaching a climax...and that was the ONLY CLIMAX present in the film!You can easily go to sleep and not miss a thing, but don't worry, at any given moment you'll be guaranteed to see breasts and legs on display! Enjoy!NOTE: If the film was a tribute to innovative dancing and against the commercial film industry, it failed miserably. If this is the case it's EXTREMELY ironic, because it delivered spot on to a mass public, eager to see a poorly covered girl. If on the other hand it wasn't, then it was just an excuse to expose some flesh." 
" Good plot, well directed, well written, poorly choreographed","Ram Gopal Varma is a in a class of his own. This is a movie about the aspirations of an aspiring choreographer & an aspiring actor. The choreographer played my Antara Mali wants to go her on way without compromising to nobody to achieve what she wants. The actor played by Abhishek Bachchan is willing to compromise to attain what he wants. Theirin lies the problems. The problems between these two characters form the basis of the movie. The script is pretty strong. The scenes between the leading characters is very well done. But the choreography lacks strength in the later part of the movie. Especially since it is a movie about the blossoming of choreographer, song dance sequences toward the end of the movie was kind of really boring." 
" Aaja Naach Le?","Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web. This one is a good portrayal, although I do not agree with it entirely. Taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, seems like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara.. both are good! The former has better acting talent, although the latter is catching up nicely.Anyways, I like Anthara's character. She is true to her art, not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical. She is a dance scientist, actually she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her. Hey.. Donald Trump.. maybe you gotta ditch Melania, here is Anthara and you've already built a Taj Mahal... ain't this easy? Abhishek on the other hand is a practical fellow, who wants money, power, fame, etc. Hence these two albeit were struggling to get a break into the film industry, cannot get along, given their different styles and approach to life. This is very typical, but what I like about the movie is that it says what an Abhimaan would say in its total runtime, in one scene! What's new? This movie takes a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it. There is always something different about RGV's movies, this one is different too, it is way too slow for his standards. In parts, it drags one almost to sleep.Noticeable It is tough to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the movie. I think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) Also, looks like Anthara is a pro in Yoga, she is way too flexible, almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby is improving as an actor with every movie. I am sure his filmstar blood is paying off rich dividends. The title song was really good, the music overall was above average." 
" Absolutely one of the most ridiculous movies ever","Ram Gopal Verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some Hollywood flick. His every film after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre. Occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one. For the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!) and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in Bollywood. They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep. And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.But hey, you're not alone!! The editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production. Only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose. Ha, joke's on you. Don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear. Puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG?!Antara Mali cannot act. RGV's lost his marbles. Abhishek tried hard but failed. No plot. No story. Nothing. She must've paid RGV handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch. What a super deal. No need for an acting career.Such absolute rubbish can only be "Made in Bollywood" of course!" 
" One of RGV's better ones","In spite of all its drawbacks Naach is a pretty good movie. The story is interesting, the characters are unusual, the songs and choreography too try to do something different. Abhishek Bachchan acts very well. Antara Mali is not bad when she is doing the serious, unsmiling scenes but the one emotional scene by her is rather ghastly. Her utter lack of makeup is very nice though. The songs and dances even though a bit weird, are acceptable as different. What pulls them down are the minimalist costumes, which consist of strange Jurassic feathers and wings and scraps of chiffon. The story is about Reva who wants to achieve her goals but on her own terms and Abhi who will do whatever it takes to achieve his. They become a couple but of course their ideologies had to clash at some point." 
" RGV makes Naach Rock!","RGV rocks with Naach. Naach is when two personalities meet - an individualistic and objective artist (dancer), Reva and an ambitious but succumbing actor, Abhinav. Reva wants to stamp her identity in her work. Abhi wants to be famous and rich although he realises that it makes him look foolish. Reva is sure; she is sure that she is right; she is sure that her way is the only way; so she is ready to wait for the world to bow down to her feet. Abhi is insecure. Abhi is pathetically in love with Reva because deep inside he desires to be what Reva is. Reva loves Abhi because he is among the few who know she is right.If you have read Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead then you will find that Reva is a Howard Roark while Abhi is almost a Peter Keating!Naach is a must watch  for its choreography, for its camera, its writing  which is minimalist, and the performance of the actors. The effort RGV puts into making the characters credible is praiseworthy. You will have no problems believing that there are people like these. The movie keeps you restless throughout the movie, an RGV trademark.Some people will go to the theaters for Antara's skin, but the once who have seen enough skin and muscle in their lives will be able to tear through the distorting mesh and enjoy the movie at a higher level.The negative to the movie is its music  not very good music for a musical. The music was experimental, as it should be, but wasn't experimental enough.The humour comes in the form of spoofs and sarcastic takes on Bollywood and it's so called Gurus.This movie does rock." 
" Could have been better!","Abhishek Bachchan annoyed me with his turn in this film. Thank God for Antara Mali who plays the other lead, I would have puked or something. I loved the premise of the film because it revolved around dance (hence the title 'Naach' which means "Dance" in Hindi) which I absolutely love and Miss Mali danced her tush off in this one! But, there just has to be a but and it comes by way of ABHISHEK BACHCHAN!!! He just acted like a spoiled-brat-out-to-get-some-action when he spots Mali's sexy (a great dancer who aspires to work and bring something new to the Bollywood dancing scene) character. She is a newbie in town who defied what her family had lined up for her, to come to Mumbai in search of her own dream. He is an out-of-work youth who is also defying his parents by going after his own dreams.While Ram Gopal Varma handles their attraction and love scenes very well, it was impossible to mask Jr. B's pouting and sulking. He falls in love with the girl, she teaches him how to dance and how to get in touch with his inner self, and when he becomes a big star, he expects her to just submit to his charms and forget about her own dreams. Mali's character doesn't mind the ultimatum, in fact, she sticks it to the ultimatum he gives her and she actually walks away. Sooner (than later) she is spotted by a new chassis (played by the charming Ritesh Deshmukh starring a Bollywood director) and a relationship is instantly implied. Once Jr. B sees this in the papers and shoots, his spoilt rich star self (which I'm sure is not very far from the man he is in real life) starts to act crazy, sulk more and ultimately demand that he gets the girl in the end. And ultimately in the end, he does." 
" If only Razzie Awards were global!","Naach would have won an Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it were global. When it comes acting badly (aka showing attitude/yawning/over (not) acting) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While the catwoman had storeline, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all.One of those movies which makes me wonder why IMDb does allow one to rate a movie as 0/10. Yet again, I think that movie does not even deserve a 0. It has to be something negative or minus infinity.OK what about the plot outline? It is a funda-giving, arrogant, full of attitude choreographer meet an useless, skill-less, loafer who aspires to be an actor tale. The story is so short that if just another sentence, IMDb might ban me for writing a spoiler. About the story-telling? Its like a bunch (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. Don't try this movie if you have bought new DVD-player. You would end up believing that either DVD is in bad shape or DVD-player is struck. Not its fault at all.At the end of it all, you end up giving some credits to the director. At least he realized that both Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) can't speak dialogues convincingly, so there are not too many dialogues in this movie. So, you can at least sleep your way through the movie, with some annoying noises from those Antra-malli song sequences.Do watch this movie if you are new to Bollywood Cinema. Once you have tolerated this movie, you would be able to see any Bollywood movie and enjoy it.There can't be worse 3 hour torture than this!"
