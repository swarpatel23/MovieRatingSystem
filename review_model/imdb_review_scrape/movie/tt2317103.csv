" Fantastic","India has stepped in to the animated world which is ruled by Japanese anime and American Disney or Pixar. And they have made quite a splendid effort. The story might not go down well with every one but it's important to know that the story is not scripted. The movie is based on Ramayana, at least what follows after Lord Ram comes back to his kingdom. Lord Ram symbolizes the ideal king, ideal husband and so on. Sita is the ideal wife, mother and so on. What this story tells us is about their ideal children, Luv and Kush. The story in itself is so beautiful that the movie had to be splendid. Animation might not be as powerful or realistic as the Americans do,but it's beautiful. It has a very sweet message in the end about brotherhood. It will help if you get to know the story of Ramayana before hand so that you realize what is actually going on and what has led to this story. It's a fantastic effort. Highly recommended."
