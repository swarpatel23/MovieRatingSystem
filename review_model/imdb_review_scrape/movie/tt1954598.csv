" A Decent Entertainer...","'Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl' is A Decent Entertainer, that works in parts. The First-Hour is quite entertaining, but the Second-Hour isn't really arresting. However, it's a film that will pass your time. 'Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl' Synopsis: A charismatic fraudster who cons ladies for a living finally meets his match when a bunch of his conquests form an equally crafty plan.'Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl' has a winning first-hour, which is full of entertaining moments. The 1st chapter is engaging, the 2nd chapter is fair, while the 3rd chapter is quick yet effective. The problem with this film, starts in it's second-hour. The entire thing of getting back to the Con-Man to teach him a lesson, is not that entertaining. Even the climax for that matter, looks superficial. Aditya Chopra's Story is watchable, but not memorable. Maneesh Sharma's Direction is good. Cinematography & Editing are passable. Music by Salim-Sulaiman, is energetic. Performance-Wise: Ranveer Singh is impressive. The actor performs his part with confidence from start to end. Anushka Sharma enters the scene late, yet does a fair job. Parineeti Chopra makes a terrific debut. Her comic-timing is just perfect. Dipannita Sharma is appropriate. Aditi Sharma is nicely restrained. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl' is, at best, a time-pass fare, that works in parts." 
" A Nutshell Review: Ladies vs Ricky Bahl","After three films under the Yash Raj banner, Anushka Sharma returns to the fold with her fifth film to date, reuniting with director Maneesh Sharma and co-star Ranveer Singh in what would be his second outing after their successful pairing and collaboration in Band Baaja Baaraat which turned out to be a sleeper hit last year, scoring nominations and awards for the filmmaker and his cast alike. Seeking to repeat that success, it unfortunately repeated what Hollywood had done with John Tucker Must Die with a trio of ladies plotting revenge over a guy, but over here it's not to get even because their hearts got broken, but more to get even because of the money he had swindled from them.And to do so, they band together to hire a glib tongue who can out-con the con man himself, which is where Anushka Sharma sashays her way into the film only at the hour mark, being that perfect brains and beauty combination to exact revenge for her employers against someone who is falling dangerously for her, and vice versa, compromising the situation at hand especially when such risky undertakings involving money, deals and counter-deals may jolly well tempt one against one's original intent, and loyalty. Anushka played her role of a salesgirl turned fake hotel heiress as bait to perfection, this being her second con game role after the stint in Badmaa$h Company, calling for that level of confidence and vulnerability, and sharing that believable chemistry with Ranveer Singh once again, and if gossip rags are right up your alley then it's of little surprise this happens to be so. Ranveer on the other hand has a number of avatars to live up to as the titular suave conman who cheats on women as a game, The first half is where the story patiently built itself up, giving ample time for Ranveer's other co-stars to show what they can do. Priyanka Chopra's cousin Parineeti Chopra makes her debut here as a student whose blind loyalty to and puppy love for her fitness trainer boyfriend Sunny Singh (Ranveer) made her the youngest and the easiest of targets. Dipannita Sharma as Raina is that ruthless businesswoman who strives to succeed at all costs, and her pride being punctured when art dealer Deven Shah (Ranveer again) sold her a renowned fake painting, and widower Saira (Aditi Sharma) got duped into believing the shy Iqbal Khan (Ranveer once more) comes with an honest heart in wanting trade in textiles with her family. To each of the girl scorned and to battle for their honour and money, they find each other by chance and plot to get their money back. And that's where Anuhka's Ishika Desai comes in.Did I mention this film requires a stretch of believability, because there's always that ample opportunity for a more thorough research being done by the characters involving background checks and legal documentation since the con they get themselves engaged in hinges very much on contracts and valuation, unless one can blame inexperience, and going up against one of the most successful conmen meant some facts can possibly be glossed over. That aside, the narrative unfortunately sagged in the second half when a spanner gets thrown in the works, and while Anushka and Ranveer may look good together on screen, it's the journey of getting there where you'd expect their characters to fall in love coming too abruptly as if in a rush for time.Still, the themes are still top notch for a romantic film, touching on regret and that one shouldn't see lonely women as marks to get into a seduction game, that the price of being conned of cash is one aspect of being hurt, but the emotional scars left behind are something else possibly more potent altogether. That, and the value of trust and one's word, how easily that can be broken way easily than to build up on. There's also a subtle jab at all things branded, when they can be easily replicated with a little bit of skill and help, having humbler items pass off as the real thing, in a way making a statement against all things ostentatious. The songs are all contemporary and catchy, but largely forgettable once you step out of the hall, while costumes and dresses just show why Anushka Sharma is quite the clotheshorse.Yash Raj Films may be looking to strike gold again with the direction and pairing of Anushka and Ranveer, but the truth is an equally compelling script is paramount to exploit their natural chemistry to the fullest. Ladies vs Ricky Bahl was quite the roller coaster ride narratively, and it's really thanks to the leading actors' chemistry that saved the film from becoming a downer, keeping it afloat and coasting along without surpassing expectations. But it's a must for fans of Band Baaja Baaraat hungry to see both Anushka and Ranveer on screen together again." 
" You can expect a few laughs, lots of colours and a happy ending. Just make sure you enter the theatre with low expectations.","With a song to start off proceedings and two more to introduce the main characters, 'Ladies vs. Ricky Behl' looked the part of a typical Yash Raj production. As expected, like everything else they've delivered this year, there was a predictable Hindi film twist to spoil what was a promising premise.Ricky Behl (Ranveer Singh) is a professional conman who targets women thanks to his good looks and charming personality. After conning 29 women including Saira Rashid (Aditi Sharma) as clothes material dealer Iqbal Khan and Dimple Chaddha (Parineeta Chopra) as gym instructor Sunny Singh, he manages to con dominating Raina Parulekar (Dipannita Sharma) and her company by pretending to be Art exhibitor Dev.With the media spotlight on her regarding the scam, Raina unites with Saira and Dimple to bring down that 'Bloody Kamina' aka Ricky Behl. They hire saleslady Ishika Desai (Anushka Sharma) in the hopes of conning the conman. The rest is well....a typical Hindi film.From the director who surprised us with Band Baaja Baaraat, Maneesh Sharma had high expectations resting on his shoulders. What began on a positive note (sans the song and dance routine) with loads of room for some fun and suspense, it fell right into the 'everyone lived happily ever after' love story category that really didn't make sense in the big picture.Cinematography and camera work was uninspiring but effective while the music by Salim-Suleiman was mediocre to say the least. Some of the wardrobe choices were odd and rather distracting especially with excess amount of skin show from the lead pair. Editing as usual could have been better to improve the pace of the film and reduce its runtime. Seriously get rid of those songs...Anushka Sharma and Ranveer Singh don't bring anything new to the table apart from what we've already seen in Band Baaja Baaraat. The chemistry they share felt rushed and therefore lacked the intensity needed to get the viewers involved. Ranveer had the perfect opportunity to shine as the films protagonist but his character variations were as awkward as his facial disguises.Parineeta Chopra as Dimple was brilliant. Her facial expressions, comic timing and body language brought some fresh energy into a 'done to death' Punjabi supporting role. She is one actor to watch out for.Dipannita Sharma as Raina was so-so as the corporate executive lost in the human rat race. Her character expected her to deliver a strong demanding performance but she felt out of place and rather rigid in her act.Aditi Sharma as Saira was a typecast Muslim supporting role with the usual dosage of formality and awkwardness that conveniently diminishes away along with the clothes as the movie progresses. Aditi chose to remain confinedWith a story (written by Aditya Chopra) that lacked the depth of a fully fledged Hindi film, the screenplay by Devika Bhagat also falls short of doing what was needed to make the film stand out. In the end, you can expect a few laughs, lots of colours and a happy ending. Just make sure you enter the theatre with low expectations." 
" Good Follow-up","Ladies Vs Richy Bahl makes for a pretty good watch for quite an amount of reasons. The movie was short, didn't get draggy at all which is only the second best part of the movie after the HOT BOD Anushka Sharma flaunts in the movie. have to give it to her, AMAZING. She could give the other ladies in the industry a run for their money. The plot is decent enough to keep you on your seats and the music well done too with a good amount of laughter moments thrown in too at good intervals mainly by this Delhi girl character(whose name I forget).So all in all the Ranveer-Anushka duo made good stuff on the screen after their first outing in Band Baaja." 
" First half impresses,..second half depresses","Again a Yash Raj movie,again a Maneesh Sharma film,again Anushka-Ranveer pairing that worked wonders in Band Baaja Baraat,but on the contrary Ladies vs Ricky Bahl never has that element of magic that BBB had.Of course u can blame Anushka coming to the fore in the second half,but the movie actually subsides in the second half itself not only because of some boring sequences but the predictability the movie creates as we rush through second half.First half is fun-filled specially because of the presence of Parineeti Chopra (Priyanka's cousin) and it never ever seems its her first movie.Ranveer as always is impressive not only in conning girls but flaunting his body with those 8 pack abs.Dipannita and Aditi have done commendable jobs.Anushka(especially in the black bikini)looks hot.Songs are OK.Overall the movie could have been better in the second half.Go for it only if you are an ardent fan of Ranveer.I go with 6/10" 
" This movie isn't as good as Band Baja Baarat......","Very disappointing.... I expect something good as BBB Film.... Wellthis time they are not a winner...On the whole, LADIES VS RICKY BAHL is, at best, a decent fare, which appeals in parts. The film starts well, even ends well. It's the in between that's plain ordinary. One definitely expected more from the director of the immensely likable BAND BAAJA BAARAAT. Ideally, the film merits a two-and-a-half star rating, but that extra half star is for Ranveer and Anushka, who steal your heart with truly striking performances. Best luck next time" 
" Dil k armaan aansuo main "BAHL" gaye.........","So girls n guys, get ready for another crap from Bollywood..."Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl"...title of course sounds energetic and full of fun, but believe me movie is a complete sh!t...so predictable and dumb story, almost looks like a sequel of DHOOM-2...well, i was expecting a lot from the director Manish Sharma that he'll give a good watchable product like BBB but all expectations were flushed away completely...leaving 2-3 scenes, whole movie was a garbage, even the cuteness and killer looks of Ranveer can't save this movie. Poor story-line with thousands of plot holes, poor direction, bad songs, average music, bad acting and poor characterizations of lead characters...u'll always be expecting something gr8 to happen but please let me remind u, u r watching a Bollywood flick...CINEMATOGRAPHY and EDITING was mind blowing but in India WHO CARES about technical aspects. TOTAL FARJIWAADA guys...in sweet n simple words, please ignore this cr@p." 
" A young movie for all ages","It was an era when Yash Raaj was mastered in Love Troika Films but since Dhoom they are continuously targeting relatively young audience and this is again a movie especially target the youth but has entertainment for all ages. People liked the on-screen chemistry between Anushka & Ranveer and greatly applauded by masses in Band Baja Barat and once again the couple is spontaneous. This is not a classic, this is not a big but a medium size film and have all ingredients to make it entertaining. Songs are great, story is good and the performance are also good but the girl in the role of Dimple (Parineeti Chopra) will inspire you with her innocence. Director Mahish Sharma who was also the director of Band Baja Barat seems still in the trans of her previous hit.Script is not much powerful but the performance of all five main characters cover this weakness and songs added worth to watch it. You can spare some time to watch it one time and you won't be conned through this con-movie." 
" Enjoyable if nothing special","Having seen Band Baaja Baaraat which I really liked, I'd had quite some expectations from Maneesh Sharma's next feature, Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl, which stars the same actors in lead roles. For me, the film is a great disappointment, though it is not that bad per se. Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl is an unoriginal film about a con man who, using different names and identities, woos young women only to eventually rob them of their property. Then his victims hire a girl to take revenge and get their money back, and this girl he really falls in love with. Blah. Yeh, this is quite an old cliché and so is this movie, which lacks not only originality, but also depth and substance. It's a glossy one though, I must say, and watching it with friends may be quite enjoyable, particularly if they are not in the mood for something serious. The film has some catchy songs as well, though none really is memorable enough. The actors are good enough, but no one is great. Ranveer is alright. He's confident, at times over-confident, but the part is too ordinary to make a difference really (and maybe I was expecting more after BBB), and it does not challenge him in any way; instead it just gives him some corny lines and silly makeovers, and the good moments are too few to matter. Anushka is just too charming to ignore, although, just like with Ranveer, the role itself is nothing special compared to her brilliant turn as Shrutti Kakkar in Band Baaja Baaraat. Yet, there is something about this girl. It's amazing how often she reminds me of Preity Zinta. She is spunky, vivacious and very pretty, and has a strong screen presence, so I still believe she has quite a future in the industry. Of the three girls, all are quite hot, but Parineeta Chopra is clearly the show-stealer and is quite a promising newcomer. She is incredibly cute and consistently credible thanks to her natural flair for comedy and superb dialect. Sadly, the cast were not given a very memorable film to work in. Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl is a most predictable film; the script is well contrived for its own good and the ending couldn't be more saccharine. It has its moments, but it's still forgettable. Watch it if you must, really." 
" Main Hoon, Main Hoon, Main Hoon Con!","Team-BBB (Band Bajaa Baraat) clearly had an advantage with their first outing. Yashraj films were at its lowest ebb which translated the expectations to sub-zero. When the winning combo decided to strike again, the sky-high expectations ended up working against it. What works?Ѻ Well written conning portions. Bollywood has generally witnessed scarcity in on this genre, Mr. Sampat and Mr. Natwarlal in the past and Bluffmaster and Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! in the recent come to my mind. Ѻ Ranveer Singh - Undoubtedly he is the one who has what it takes to carry the mantle forward. Ѻ Anushka Sharma - Seamless performance. A word of advice to the leading ladies of 90's who are toying the idea of returning from sabbatical. You quit when you were ahead of the game, so stay put. Watch her and you will know why.Ѻ Parineeta Chopra - A surprise package. This dark horse nearly stole the thunder from Anushka Sharma.Ѻ Choreography on a few select songs.Ѻ Authentic supporting characters.Let downs.Ѻ The mushy-mushy YRF ingredient. Seriously, the plot had enough potential to steer for a better finale otherwise.Ѻ The spicy ingredients which went missing in the second-half.Ѻ The grand conning act appears to be long drawn.Verdict: A definite one-time watch material. And looking forward to the next outing from Team-BBB!" 
" From "Rom-Con" To "Rom-Com"","Expectations - If you have watched "Band Baaja Baaraat" then you can't even think to miss Ladies V/S. Ricky Bahl. Ranveer-Anushka chemistry, Ranveer's charm and killer looks, Anushka's smart and stylish acting skills, superb music by Salim-Sulaiman and Maneesh Sharma's smart and entertaining direction skills which comes in a "Yash Raj Films" brand-mark - everything was back again in this movie. The stylish promos, Ranveer-Anushka's "Thug Le" music video & that promising comeback feel - everything raised people's expectations much much higher. Frankly, I was extremely keen for LVRB as I liked BBB very very very much. That movie delivered much freshness in Rom-Coms released in Bollywood.LVRB is a smart-tale from start to end which can be called "Classy" in a word. But still an inspiration from a very famous movie "John Tucker Must Die (2006)". But some usual changes do take place as the story of this movie is written by Aditya Chopra. So, the romantic and emotional parts are much tighter here.As the story unfolds from start to last, Dimple (Parineeti Chopra) falls for a gym-trainer Sunny Singh who cons his dad and flees away that instant. Next we see Raina (Dipannita Sharma), a hard-working, successful corporate woman who is conned by Deven Shah. Then both of them come to know that Saira (Aditi Sharma), a simple, hard working widow was also conned by Iqbal Khan. They figure out that Sunny, Deven & Iqbal are the same person. Who Is He? Meet Ricky Bahl (Ranveer Singh) - a lady-charmer, a perfect conman whose only motive is nothing but money.Raina, Dimple & Saira plans to track down Ricky through Ishika Desai (Anushka Shrma), a young and ambitious Goa by conning Ricky and get their money back. The Ultimate Showdown begins is Goa....Director Maneesh Sharma handles some moments perfectly like The Dimple story, Ranveer's entry and much more. A Smart script is noticed in the whole movie. But he disappoints much as one expected another BBB from him. But many qualities that BBB had lacks entirely in the movie. Entertainment quotient, 'Jhallipan' in lead actors, Ranveer was charming but not the BITTOO SHARMA that justified him, Anushka also looked much sour. Music By Salim-Sulaiman is as usual top notch. Tracks like "AADAT SE MAJBOOR" & "JAZBA" works perfect, "FATAL ATTRACTION" was awesome & "THUG LE" was the show stealer for its mind-boggling choreography by Vaibhavi Merchant. Aseem Mishra's cinematography was fine as GOA was mostly captured in the movie. Habib Faisal's dialogs lacked confidence and spice.We have seen Ranveer Singh in on of the most liked characters ever that was BITTO SHARMA. Ranveer's role is LVRB was totally opposite of it. Special Charm, Smartness & classy attitudes were the main ingredients of this role which Ranveer gave much justice to. Ranveer can now be easily called as one of the finest heroes appeared at recent times. He is undoubtedly the Show-stealer in all respects. Anushka Shrama (better known as 'Tani Partner' or 'Shruti Kakkar') evolves even more as an leading lady through this movie. Her acting was convincing, confident, ambitious and lacked dullness. The pair of Ranveer-Anushka is the winner of this movie.We see a new talent coming up through this movie which is Parineeti Chopra (Priyanka Chopra's Cousin). Her role was total "Jhalli" and she carried it out perfectly. Bravo! Dipannita Sharma was perfect as a no-nonsense corporate woman. Aditi Sharma was fine but natural. Shireesh Sharma, father of Dimple in the movie was fine.Finally, Ladies Vs. Ricky Bahl doesn't disappoint. What disappoints is Maneesh Sharma's promising comeback. Band Baaja Baaraat was one of the best movies of last year while LVRB is a decent fare. Ranveer and Anushka's deadly chemistry and performances by lead actors try a lot to abolish the flaws of the movie but it failed to convince the audiences who came to watch another fun-flick like Band Baaja Baaraat. The conning episodes, Ranveer Singh, Anushka Sharma, both of them together, the romantic portions and climax works for a big time, but still the movie lacked 'unforgettable' moments and freshness. Watch If You've Nothing Better To Do!" 
" Entertaining but could've been better with a little different ending.","I am not a fan of either Ranveer Singh or Anushka Sharma but after watching Band Baaja Baraat I gave this movie a try and was pleasantly surprised.The story is about Ricky Bahl played nicely by Ranveer Singh, who cons ladies for a living. Three of his victims band together to con him with the help of Anushka Sharma.All the three ladies- Dimple (the Punjabi girl), Raina (the manager from Mumbai) and Saira (the Lucknow chick) {I don't know their real names} have played their part convincingly especially the Punjabi girl. Anushka Sharma is okay given what she had to do. However the ending could've been a little better if they showed the ladies actually succeeding in conning Ricky Bahl by their wits and intelligence rather than him having a change of heart and giving them their money back. That's just something I thought would've been better since a large part of the movie consists of them working hard to accomplish their plan.But still it's a nice and entertaining movie. Some songs are nice and some weren't that necessary as they only added to the length of the movie." 
" Hilarious but an okay movie","The comedy was amazing! And the conning was interesting too. But what I didn't believe was the romance. It happened too fast and it was unbelievable." 
" A well presented con story.....","When I first heard of "Ladies v/s Ricky Behl"....and saw the first theatrical trailer, I was a little apprehensive about the film...There has been a lot of films all over the world dealing with the topic of conning. Con films have almost become a genre of cinema. But then after watching this particular film, I was impressed. The narrative of the film had something new for the audience, with the titles coming up after 22 minutes running time. Moreover, the film is not a long-drawn story about a big con plan and how you execute it. It deals with a number of different, but mind-boggling con plans, along with an extra spark i.e the different identities that the protagonist takes while conning people. This factor makes it a wee bit different, and a lot more exciting, than many other con films. Now, talking about the cast, Parineeti Chopra was brilliant in her performance. Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma looked good individually, but their chemistry looked better. The other actors also worked whole- heartedly, among whom Dipannita Sharma turned some eyes. In a single line, "Ladies v\s Ricky Behl" is a good story, but a brilliant presentation..." 
" Anushka's bikini scene was the only 10seconds of the movie worth watching.","why why why "Dippanita Sharma"?! she cant act, she's not pleasant on the eyes, bad dialogue delivery, bad make up, its uncomfortable just watching her and you give her the commanding role!? WTF? story line isn't intriguing or gripping at all, the Cons are poorly and unconvincingly constructed and Ranveer singh (the second best actor in the movie known for his dialogue delivering ability) has the least amount of lines to speak!The end is hurried and doesn't make much sense. why do the girls especially Dippanita Sharma's character help him find love, when she was humiliated and almost fired ( for which had she decided to con him in the first place) get no redemption.Band baaja baraat was such a well thought of film in terms of story line and screenplay, its hard to believe this comes from the same director and writers.The only two highlights of the film are Anushka sharma (who's grown as an actor and it shows) she plays her character brilliantly and delivers her acting skills very well. Her bikini sequence steals the whole show and is the biggest highlight of the movie. The Second is "Parineeta Chopra" a newcomer who plays a delhiite. Her acting and screen presence were commendable, someone to look out for in the future." 
" Not Impressed","This movie is strictly a pastime for it has the typical Yashraj elements-glamour, song and dance, appealing visuals, etc. Where it loses big time is in the script. The pull offs by Ranveer's character are very unimpressive and far fetched like never before. Since the movie moves sequentially, I'll try to do the same.For Parineeti, I don't get all the hype. She is no different from a typical brainless Yashraj heroine, bubbly and bimbo albeit Preity Zinta. And no, I did not find her expressionless acting to be 'cute'. For her story and character, it is as shallow as the performance, and there is nothing interesting enough here to comment.I am impressed by Dipannita Sharma, a model who can act. She gives the character exactly what it demands. But unfortunately the character is poorly written, and this one story is the most unbelievable of the three. Fooling a self made business minded woman cannot be cakewalk.Aditi Sharma is cute and also a performer. Her character's story is boring to say the least but it is her performance that makes it endearing.Last here is Anushka, who looks exotic and gives a very earnest performance. Undoubtedly, she has the central role here. I can give one star each to this movie only for these three brilliant ladies. Unfortunately, her's is another poorly scripted character with nothing beyond the ms. goodie-two-shoes.As for Ranveer, I would give a big thumbs down for his monotonous and uninvolved performance. He has great scope here to be a real charmer, but that never comes across.The music is average, but poorly fitted in with songs coming out of the blue and seeming absolutely unnecessary. The background score is offensive and irritating. The predictability of the story will make you yawn.I watched Dumb Laga Ke Haisha before this, and I can say Yashraj has truly evolved. Please don't regress to this level again."
