" A worth applauding effort revealing a hidden shameful truth of our society which is a must watch particularly for the youngsters in our part of the world.","The experience of watching AKAASH VANI gave me enough to think or write upon after a long time since BOL (2011). Though the film is not a masterpiece if you analyze it in cinematic terms, but on the basis of its subject and execution it strongly makes you question our own Indian social structure and WE The People accepting it blindly to maintain our so called social image in front of the others.The Review Promoted as a pure romantic film with a commercial angle, AV starts off well on a lighter note with the girl Nusrat (Vaani) impressing you right away more than the boy Kartik (Akaash). The word love is written on the screen from its first frame itself and their entertaining, likable romance draws you in till the intermission. Director Luv Ranjankeeps it realistic as seen in his PYAR KA PUNCHNAMA and that's the reason why the love story wins over the viewer reminding them of all those soft romantic films before the 90s. But the story doesn't progress much in the first half and the twist is just revealed before the intermission.In the second half, it surprises you with something very important & relevant, revealing an ugly truth of our society dealing with Arranged Marriage, Love Marriage and Marital Rape. Despite of its slow progression and few dragging moments the narration doesn't lose its grip mainly due to the brilliantly written dialogues by the director Luv himself and some splendid performances by the entire cast. For instance, you can easily feel the pain when Vaani says to Akaash, "Yahan Jab Tak Shareer Par Nishaan Na Ho., Koi Maanta Nahin Hai!" or when she calmly answers her father that, "Aapke Kaaran Mujhe Kya Kya Sehna Parha Hai, Woh Main Aapko Bata Bhi Nahin Sakti" Further the tense moments in this better half are handled well by the cinematographer too which forces you to give your full attention to what the characters are willing to portray, keeping the interest alive throughout.However watching a marital rape on the screen is not anything usual or amusing and thus the team surely deserves all the praises to bring up this hidden truth in a Hindi Film in such a subtle manner, which has been rarely done by others in the 100 years of Indian Cinema. In fact in the recent times I remember a film called MITTAL VS MITTAL(2010) taking up this issue as a cheap sexual gimmick to sell itself in the market and then another classic made on a related issue called MATRUBHUMI (2005) which also is a not to be missed gem without any doubt.The shocking drama in the script gets its full support from the performers and it's a Nusrat's film all the way wherein the girl even reminded me of veterans such as Madhuri Dixit in her difficult scenes of emotional pain and outburst. Kartik supports her well with confidence but the subject basically revolves around Nusrat's life and the trauma she is forced into by her own family. Along with the cute lead pair the director has very carefully chosen his supporting cast in which everyone has lived his or her role impressively especially the actors playing the couple's friends. So we have a great emotional & important film here conceived and performed well following a decent vision.As an essential requirement of a sensible love story, AV also has a fabulous soundtrack featuring 4 great songs with highly poetic & meaningful lyrics penned by the director Luv Ranjan himself again. Both the tracks and background score have been composed & arranged intelligently by Hitesk Sonik and I really wish the soundtrack was promoted more by the makers to reach their real listeners. The 4 worth listening songs are Ittefaq Tha Ek Mazaak Tha, Roomani, Bas Main Aur Tu and Tere Pyar Mein which have great lyrics reminding you of the famous GULZARISM loved and appreciated widely. For instance sample these few lines from one of its great songs,"Soch Kar Main Jisko Hass Leta Hun, Ittefaaq Tha....., Ek Mazaaq Tha....., Tere Mera Naam! Tere Hi Pher Mein..Boodhe Ek Pedh Pe, Kuchh Lakeerein Kheench Di Thi Do Din Bhi Na Rahey Un Kharonchon Ke Nishan.......! Ittefaaq Tha....., Ek Mazaaq Tha....., Tere Mera Naam!Hence with a fresh breezy first half and an intense thought provoking second one AKAASH VANI can easily be called an important & well made project by the multi talented Luv Ranjan who undoubtedly has got the vision to give us something different and valuable. The film needs to be shown to every youngster above 18 as a mandatory clause and then a Q & A session should be held in colleges taking up the 3 issues discussed ahead in the other section of this article. On a concluding note, we definitely need more films like this as our wake-up call and the youngsters need to watch it in the theater to encourage its visionary makers." 
" Best romantic movie of recent times","The movie is an excellent narration of the love between 2 people. Unlike other romantic movies released around the year of release this deals with the trials and tribulations of a love affair during modern times in the Indian context.What really stands out in the movie is that the love between the 2 protagonists is no where demonstrated as sexual in any form. A refreshing change from the modern day Indian movies where people go about smooching at the flip of a hat.What also stands out is the social message with a dose of practicality. All this keeping the Indian culture in mind makes it a must see for people who like watching a mature movie.I would say the promotions are misleading though. If this would have been taken care of I am sure the movie would have done better commercially by attracting the right audience.Unlike his first movie, Pyaar Ka Punchnama, Luv Ranjan, the director does not keep this movie as an all out comedy. That does not mean that the movie lacks wit and humor. Aakash Vani has it's moments of fun, however the audience should expect a mature drama when going to watch the movie.The role of the two protagonists is very well played by Nushrat Bharucha and Kartik Tiwari. Given the right roles and opportunities these actors would be able to make a mark in the industry.Luv Ranjan shows once again how a good director could turn a simple story into a wonderful narrative and yet maintain characters that one can relate to." 
" Strictly for people who have been in true love","If not awesome, i will call this movie an almost successful attempt of pointing out the problems of small town lovers. Just to make things clear, a small town love is way different that what we know about growing up in cities. And the lovebirds there are more of love-fugitives. Coming back to the movie, it starts well with college romance with some kool dialogue sequences. Then we have the on-the-verge-of-growing-up decisions. And then we have the dramatic outcome of the decisions. and an OK ending after an expected climax. These points used to be enough for movies to be a blockbuster. But wait, who is talking about 70s here. Movie is just OK for people who understands and have been in love. But on the other hand, it can be a disaster to one who does not give it a thought. I will still give it an 8 for the story and some nice tunes. Alert, you may fall asleep several times if you are not that into love and all those stuffs. ;)" 
" Only for true lovers and who belong from a middle class families.","The movie has a strong message. Although execution could have been better.Acting was OK, OK only. but the storyline was great and really depicts the existing problem in our society specially middle class families. Nice attempt to show some of the real challenges faced by modern lovers. The parents should also watch this movie along with the children so that they give a thought on their child's happiness before choosing a life partner for him/her.Although majority of the population may not like this movie but hey all movies cannot be same and equally good. so its a nice HATKE kind of movie." 
" Incredible work","Luv Ranjan, after Pyaar ka Panchnaama, creates another masterpiece with a brilliant portrayal of contemporary relationships and the associated problems.. An innocent and believable love story followed by a rare and strong depiction of the physical and psychological horrors of a forced arranged marriage.. the disturbing visuals of post marital abuse and sufferings a woman may silently be made to go through.. The serious and real repercussions of making needless and senseless sacrifices under the influence of regressive, and almost always oppressive, social norms.. an angry social commentary remarking upon the need to re-look at the blind adherence to parent's wishes.. Real emotions, real lives and real problems played out through powerful characters and strong dialogues.. enjoyable humor and a couple of songs with the most beautiful lyrics..the performance of the negative characters, so engaging that it was difficult for the audience to hide their disapproval for the same..I think that in itself is just a great sign for a movie.. AkaashVani .. Incredible cinema.." 
" Beware it might bore a non-romanticist","Before going for this movie I casually asked one of my friend if this is going to be another long romantic 'Notebook' type melodrama. Well he wasn't sure and a few hours later I was more sure of it. Lets not compare the two since the stories and setup is very distinct. It all started very promising with seniors asking the two main characters propose each other on their first day at college. Even after that it had some lively scenes involving the two protagonist like the the laundry room scene which actually got me all excited about it's prospects. I was even cracking up hearing some insanely good dialogues which were well accommodated with the movie feel. But these moments of magical experience were somewhat like beep sound in a family show on TV.The first thing that really irked the hell out of me and this might be personal choice is the use of so much colour. It was like someone was bombarding colour balloons on the screen from behind. The clothes, mufflers, furniture even the walls had different colours, ghastly!!. The movie is also splayed with many still moments of hammy romance. I can watch Pacino or Aamir Khan eye his villain for any amount of time but replace the setting and mood with two good looking characters (hardly) emoting their love to each other, I perhaps will got to sleep in the next few seconds. I know that some of you aficionados of romantic movies will tell me that I am drunk and for my own convenience should go home and read Shakespeare. I get it, but that doesn't rule out the fact that the movie became quite lethargic after the first hour. It had it's moments but compared to the many dull moments I had to sit through, it was testing my patience.The movie in fact imbibes very noble message, but it finds it difficult to carry the good along with it. The editing in this movie is very poor, it could have been easily a 2 hour movie. The songs and music is below par but bearable. Moving on to the cast, the two actors share a deep chemistry after their known first film. Nushrat Bharucha is superb in showing her skills throughout the movie. In another world this would have been a tailor-made female centric movie, hers to take. Kartik Tiwari does great initially with some lively moments but I have doubts when it comes to serious scenes. Luv Ranjan may have hit a homerun with Pyar ka Punchnama but in this movie, he falls short.I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like mushy romantics, others can take their chances if you have nothing to do." 
" A movie with some kind of magic","When this (Akaash Vani) movie got released, I hadn't yet watched first movie of Luv Ranjan so I was actually unaware about the piece of art he makes. After the suggestion of one of my friend, I gave this a try even after noticing the IMDb rating of 6.3. But wait what? This movie came to me as a surprise. 
I can say that the movie may be was ahead of it's time because the whole movie was itself a poem. The circumstances which is not favourable to anyone is pointly and deeply have been shown in the movie. Luv Ranjan is purely an artistic person and I hope he will keep making such movies." 
" A must watch for parents","Now its time to realize that love is very important between a couple. A boy/Girl can adjust in arranged marriage only if they didn't have any relation ship already otherwise not.Your children trust you and love you that is why they tell you that they love someone... otherwise they can ignore you and get married their own.Now its time..that parents face the society for their children." 
" Had Potential","This film is confused in itself as it struggles between a love story and a story of emotional abuse. I understand the director's attempt to depict how Aakaash's love inspires Vani to want to live life to the fullest, but the execution fails on this prime point. It makes me wish that the film had been entirely about the second issue.Beginning with the story, the first half is a typical love story that annoys with random double edged diaglogues. The songs are not memorable, and I guess this part stretches for a boring forty minutes until Vani's life changes dramatically. It is easy to be sorry for Vani here, seeing her helplessness as she witnesses the pain of her father. Full credit to Kiran Kumar here for his very realistic portrayal. The movie then goes to narrate the plight of a woman married to a very cold and abusive man who never physically assaults, but matches the damage with his nastiness. He treats his wife as nothing but an object to be ill treated. This is where the movie could have taken a new level, but unfortunately, it is either the budget or the editing that fails here. The narrative never moves outside Vani's apartment, and the audience would have definitely liked to explore this traumatic relationship at different scenarios. In terms of time, Akash returns soon and we have a love story presented to us again. An issue of great importance being sandwiched between a cliché love tale cannot make it's mark.For the performances, I never really liked Karthik Aryan with his goofy smile in his first film. But here, it was worse perhaps because he was required to present a sensitive and inspiring character. All that came across was a superficial, wannabe cutesy protagonist. Nusrat had a great opportunity too. She's nice on several counts. She's non-irritating, looks pained when required and shows hers fearlessness well. Unfortunately though, she is quite melancholic and this does not work for 60% of the film which is about her love affair with Aakaash. The other actors are wasted, at best.Luv Ranjan's heart is at the right place with the film. When Vani says she fought her way out for herself and not for Aakaash, I just wish the film had actually made it look so." 
" Really Nice","Very very nice movie. A nice depiction of what happens when two people don't blend in a marriage. This is the story of so many girls who compromise everything for happiness of family and in the process, they tend to lose their individuality, their freedom, their happiness. It is not really supply words but emotions, affections speaks it all. i love the story.... it is amazing!!!!Akaash and Vani fall in love with each other and continue a 4-year relationship. As their final year comes to an end, Akaash decides to go to UK for his further studies. Vani returns to Dehradun to attend her sister's wedding from where all the bad times start." 
" A good story but the application lacked pace","The message and the aim of the film is quite obvious, in particular highlighted by the girl's speech to her parents before she takes an independent step, so kudos to the film-maker for that, but sadly though the film was too long in length I felt and hence lacked pace.It gets too boring right from the moment the girl, Vani, meets Akaash once again in her life. Sure enough they had to show how he makes her feel totally different and how he respects those little things that meant so much to her, but it did not require a demonstration of every little moment for about 25-30 minutes.Minus that it was overall a pretty good film in my view." 
" Disappointing","After the refreshing PYAAR KA PUNCHNAMA, the director comes with a 80s style romance with this film. The film tries to keep it modern in lingo but the treatment is as old as hills. The boy meet girl story, the arrange marriage and the entire drama towards the end is all old fashioned.Direction is decent in scenes, some scenes are well handled but the film ends up being a 80s melodrama Music is decentKarthik Tiwari in his second outing is better and relaxed Nusrat is superb in her role,Sunny Nijar is okay Kiran Kumar is good rest are okay" 
" Not upto the mark...Editing is poor","Watched "AkaashVaani" yesterday. Expectations were high as many people have said its different and good one.Story: AkaashVani movie is a very intense love story about two young people who can't think beyond their mutual love. It's about the hardships in love.I will say that in acting part there was not much problem. Kartik has done good work and Nusarat has done excellent.Director has tried to show different shadows and different situations which is creating issues in regular life but still its too much weak as it has many unnecessary scenes as editing is poor...BGM was satisfactory but some songs were unnecessarily kept.In my opinion its the movie which wont make much difference if you watch or don't." 
" In modern era of satellite channels it is old fashioned and outdated Aakash-Vani (Radio)","Promo of this movie was promising something like ''PYAR KA PANCHNAMA' , my favorite one movie but Aakash-Vani is totally different from its promo. Even makers tried to encash the success of Pyar ka Ka Panchnama. Promo promised love story with modern approach but film belongs to era of seventies with a few spice of modern era. Story line and message behind it is good but this message couldn't be conveyed in interesting way. Screenplay by Director, Love Ranjan is boring. Scenes are very old type. Dialogues by Director, himself is also very old fashioned. Performance wise Kartik Tiwari as Aakash is just OK. Nushrat Bharucha as Vani is competent. Music is not impressive. Even lyrics are very forced to match the Gulzar saab style but badly attempted. One song line '' Raat ko diya dhakka subeh ho gayi'' is good but rest lines of this song does not support the first line. After all, movie is very slow and lengthy."
