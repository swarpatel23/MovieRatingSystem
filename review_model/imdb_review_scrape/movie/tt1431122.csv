" Excellent comedy after a while!","This movie is for people with a sense of humor. Anyone who doesn't will most likely give it a low rating like some already did, however it deserves better.Sure there is room for improvement but which movie doesn't? Indian cinema hasn't come out with a great comedy since the release of No Entry, and this is one that falls in the top 10 list of comedies along with No Entry. Failures like Golmaal 3, and a lot of others with huge disappointment, this one is not a fail but a great hit with the entire family.Please do watch the movie and decide on your own, don't let the reviews stray you away from a good movie." 
" Good Movie with great comedy punches","### ### ### Good Movie with lot of comedy punchesEnjoy the movie with a light mood and you will find yourself laughing hard in almost every scene of movie. As one critic pointed before the movie is for the viewers with sense of humor. Of course the songs are not good and also are not needed but with great comic timings and scenes this one is a small sacrifice. Just go with the flow of movie, don't do the mistake of applying logic and you will enjoy it.#### ######" 
" Not worst of 2010 but WORST of ALL TIME!!!","worst movie of all time. random scenes put together which make no sense everything is out of place it seems as if the actors are reading the script to each other rather than acting. And the Pornographic scenes do not help the movie either. Lots of explicit scenes which make it seem almost as if this is a pornographic film. Given the cast of this film i have no doubt i could have made a better movie than this sorry director. I had no idea until today he also made singh is king which was better and actually funny. I was unfortunate and unlucky enough to watch this in a theater and i have to say i was very uncomfortable watching this movie as it was embarrassing rather than funny to watch. Worst worst stay away!" 
" it is worst movie of 2010","I am in big problem after watching "NO PROBLEM". Its like how a director of hit movies like "NO ENTRY" "WELCOME" SINGH IS KINNG" made a movie called "NO PROBLEM"? I cant believe this. This time he fails to make us laugh. Its a worst film of this year. Watch it if u like to torture yourself. Performances are also dull Presh Rawal is bearable but others are not at all good. An actor like Anil Kapoor is wasted. I dnt know why Kangana Ranawat is in this film she has no timing of comedy. Also why Neetu Chnadra is in film she is also doin nothing in film. Akshay Khanna and Sanjay Dutt done nothing great they are as usual. Sunil Shetty is also ordinary. It may make some people laugh who dnt carry their brains along with them while watching movie bot certainly a night mare for us who watch movies expectin little sense in it. Also none of the song is impressive. Even if u keep ur thinking capacity n brains outside theaters still u vil hardly laugh." 
" Cheap humor in a wanna be James Bond movie","Such a crap movie! Cheap humor that looked like a Donald Duck cartoon movie mixed in a r&b music video clip with two youngsters holding money riding in a car and half naked woman hanging around them. This movie is not even a teenage movie. Also violence that didn't make sense, aggressive women and men hitting each other. What is so funny about that? The movie was childish, silly, flaw and filled with bad humor with aggressive scenes. Also the woman in this movie were shameless dressed, not any cultural values at all. The movie tries very hard to be an American Bond movie, but this is the worst replica ever. What a shame that this movie is in cinema's now. After 15 minutes or so a walked out the movie room." 
" Anees Bazmee's Worst Movie of All-Time! Clearly He was Drunk!","I am a huge fan of Welcome, No Entry, Mujhse shaadi Karogi, and Sing Is King and Anees Bazmee has an impressive resume of movies in the past which were mega hits. Therefore, I was super excited to see this movie as it had an amazing cast with so much potential, little did I knew I was in treat for the biggest flops of all time. For God sakes ANY MOVIE WITH DIAMONDS in storyline is an utter flop instantly, I'm sick of watching flop comedies all about DIAMONDS, this concept never works and directors and writers cannot seem to understand this point, Just Recently the movie Prince became a mega-disaster as well because of this concept. This movie had absolutely no storyline what-so-ever. It was an torture finishing this movie which took me 3 days to do as I couldn't bare to see such good actors in an utter failed movie.The only treat about this movie was watching Sushmita Sen on big screen again, she's just too damn gorgeous. Promos of this movie were giving strong indication that this movie will be great, but it was complete opposite. I was happy to see that little girl from Comedy Circus but they did not give her any lines nor used any of her talents. She alone could've taken this movie to a new heights. I felt sorry for people who actually bought tickets to go see this movie in theatres.I was super excited to learn about the No Entry Sequel but now I am really afraid that it will never match up to it's originality, and especially after seeing this movie, Anees Bazmee needs to stop everything and go over everything to ensure that No Entry 2 is not as disastrous as this movie.Honestly this movie deserves 1 star out of 10 but I'm rating it 3 just for the casts efforts to at least show up and complete this movie!" 
" A brainless yet good comedy movie","I don't know why people are bashing this movie so badly. I was in 10th when I watched this flick in theatre. Being young, I used to like the typical slapstick genre comedy thus I liked this one also. Years after today I watched it on YouTube and still found it funny. I know there is not story in the movie, scenes are also bundled up without any sense, performances are average but the one area where the movie scores is its comedy punches. The movie will definitely give u several moments of laughter especially the scenes between Anil Kapoor and Sushmita Sen. Kangna Ranaut is the most irritating character in the movie. Can watch the movie for a little laughter." 
" The film has many problems","Anees Bazmee,the director who is famous for hits such as No Entry,Welcome and Singh is Kinng delivers No Problem this time. Even though Welcome and Singh is Kinng were silly they provided ample laughs.Comparing to No Problem this films look classic. No Problem has a big problem it fails to entertain. Anees has a done a bad work.How come an actor like Anil Kapoor produce this film?.The music is average barring Mast Punjabi.The Cinematography is very nice. Performance wise-Sanjay Dutt is good.Paresh Rawal is the scene stealer.Anil Kapoor,Akshaye Khanna,Kangana Ranaut,Suniel Shetty,Neetu Chandra,Sushmita Sen,Shakti Kapor,Suresh Menon and Baby Saloni do only one thing that is ham or shout in the movie.Even we have Ranjeet(70's famous villain),hidden behind facial shrubbery, given barely three lines of dialogue, and made to play a villainous henchman to, um, Suniel Shetty.He is wasted.On the whole No Problem deserves a special mention in the Razzies." 
" Do they assume the viewers as fools sitting in the theaters while making such crap.","There was only one feeling in my mind and heart, after watching just 30 minutes of NO PROBLEM and the feeling was of burning anger and disgust. Before writing anything else about the movie, I would like to ask few simple questions to the director and his entire team of actors and writers involved in this film which are : "Do they have any idea how difficult it is to earn a 100 - 300 rupees for a common man who delightfully spends that amount on films being released every week without even thinking once?" or"Are they not at all concerned about giving something to enjoy to the person who is spending his hard earned money on their fast made movies, week after week?" or "Do they assume all the VIEWERS as FOOLS sitting in the theaters who would enjoy and clap on just anything served to them in the name of comedy?.The above questions are enough to give you an idea of how low I would like to rate this movie on the whole. In fact NO PROBLEM is unarguably one of the worst movies presented before us in the recent years with such a huge star cast. The film clearly gives us an indication that the genre of Comedy has now further degraded to much lower levels by our film-makers in their lust of making some quick bucks.Storyline has never been the key feature of an Aneez Bazmee film and he has always copied ideas from the west for almost all of his previous successful films. But with NO PROBLEM, I would seriously like to doubt on his status of being known as a BIG TIME DIRECTOR too. With a project like NO PROBLEM which seems to be made by some school children who know nothing about cinema, it really puts a big question mark on the cinematic understanding of every single person involved in its making.A total disaster from the word GO, the film has no story development, no characterization and no entertainment value of any sort right till its end. I was very sorry to see the veteran ANIL KAPOOR both as one of the lead actors and also the producer of the film which is sure going to be a big forgettable black chapter of his otherwise illustrious career. Moreover I really never expected this kind of project coming from his own production house.Where the first half of the movie is bad, the second half even goes beyond the definition of bad. With a Cop laughing due to two bullets left in his stomach and people falling and hitting each other just to make you laugh, it makes you feel like shouting from your seat to have the ticket money back. The last reels of the movie are the most ridiculous ones where in Aneez Bazmee once again uses the getup and characters of SIKHS to raise some laughter, which in my opinion should now readily be considered as offensive. The music and songs are way below the standards with only one peppy song written around Punjab and its people. Though Cinematography is fine capturing all the foreign locations effectively but the background score is too loud and disturbing.In the acting department, I would not like to comment on anyone at all, because everyone is equally awful in their allotted roles (with a lot of renowned names even going to the extent of hamming). And what a mess they have made of the talented young Baby Saloni, around whom a whole short film can be written. Till now you must have got the idea about how terrible my experience may have been watching NO PROBLEM. And to end it on a more interesting note, I would like to mention that I simply left the theater the moment two Gorrillas came from no-where in a Party Hall to help the heroes. May be I should have left long before that." 
" Useless movie","Save your time. Give this garbage movie a pass. A totally awful movie. Only saving grace is the beautiful photography of scenic South Africa. All the actors in this movie are totally wasted. How could the big stars agree to act in this garbage movie? I am surprised. Sushmita Sen overacts. Kangana Raut looks ugly. Only Sanjay Dutt and Paresh Rawal get the passing grade.Even Anil Kapoor gives a so-so performance.There is no central thread and the movie keeps lurching from frame to frame. It is meaningless to try and follow whet is happening. Total garbage on display.As I said, save your time.Do not watch this movie." 
" Dull!","The kind of Cinema filmmaker Anees Bazmee churns out belongs to the masses. 'No Entry' and 'Welcome' were blockbusters. 'Singh Is King' was a hit, so his track record is quite good. Sadly, his latest effort 'No Problem', has flopped.The problem with 'No Problem' is it's writing. Bazmee loves non-sense, but his earlier films at least had a convincing story, which were packed with tons and tons of laughter. 'No Problem' not only suffers from poor writing, but also the jokes over-here fall flat.'No Problem' is about 2 small time crooks, a innocent bank manager, a bungling ham-handed cop and a gang of baddies, coming into one shelter, well, in way. Thus follows a journey of complete non-sense and poor jokes.Anees Bazmee fails to deliver. The first hour is average, while the second hour is absolutely disappointing. The climax is the weakest link. It just doesn't work! The Cinematography is alright. The soundtrack is a mixed-bag.Performance-Wise: Paresh Rawal is the only actor who stands out. Like always, the legend plays his part with effortless ease. Anil Kapoor hams to the hilt. He tries so hard. Sanjay Dutt is passable. Suniel Shetty does not deliver, while Akshaye Khanna manages a few moments. Sushmita Sen, well, the less said the better. Kangna Ranaut and Neetu Chandra are wasted. Shakti Kapoor, Mukesh Tiwari, Ranjeet & Vishwajeet Pradhan get nothing to do.On the whole, a dull and non-happening comedy, that disappoints from the word go. Thumbs Down!" 
" No Problem huh?","Anees Bazmee who got lucky with NO ENTRY, WELCOME AND SINGH IS KINNG yet again tried to use the same formula but this time he had problems He brought in his favourite Anil Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt, Akshaye Khanna, Sunil Shetty and NO Problem is ready. The film however was a failure It has lot of problems actually to be precise First of All the comedy scenes are so stupid they make you cringe, like Sushmita's psychotic split personality, Anil getting fits of laughter due to his bullets, Akshaye,Sanju scenes the entire film is so stupid Even the gorilla scenes take things too farDirection is horrible Music is horribleSanjay Dutt is nothing great, Akshaye Khanna fails to impress, perhaps their roles are to be blamed, Anil Kapoor tries very hard but he can't save the film alone, Sunil Shetty is as usual, Neetu Chandra is okay, Kangana overacts like no tomorrow, even Sushmita Sen gives her company Paresh Rawal is nothing great, Vijay Raaz fails to impress" 
" The movie has big problem,it fails to entertain","No Problem directed by Anees Bazmee is painful watch.This might be a shame on comedy since it does not have a single funny scene.The story is puerile.The screenplay is bad too.The music is a yawn.Performances-Paresh Rawal is the gem of this awful movie.Sanjay Dutt is good.Akshaye Khanna,Anil Kapoor,Sushmita Sen,Kangana Ranaut,Shakti Kapoor,Suniel Shetty,Vishwajeet Pradhan,Kamal Chopra and Neetu Chandra only shout.On the whole No Problem is a movie made only for psychiatrists." 
" This is a good comedy film","Can't believe some critics gave it negate reviews.Usually Bazmee films are silly and stupid like Singh is King, Thank You and Ready which were utter craps. The exception is Welcome, Welcome back and No problem.Like the other reviewers said, if you sense of humour, you'll get laughs out of this film.If you don't have sense of humour and can't see fun in this movie, then you will hate.Entertainment is what this film is about.The ending is bit silly, thus becomes the weakest point of the film.If you like this comedy, also see: One Two Three, another underrated comedy film.I rate No problem 8 out of 10." 
" Disastrous!","No Problem is plain disaster! The movie is painful and awful.Story:- After bank owner, Zandulal's (Paresh Rawal) money is stolen by Yash (Sanjay Dutt) and Raj Ambani (Akshaye Khanna), he faces financial ruin and sets out to apprehend the duo. He does locate them - right next to his mansion - and is all set to turn them over to bumbling Senior Inspector Arjun Singh (Anil Kapoor), who has personal issues with his hyper wife, Kajal (Sushmita Sen). Circumstances, and the indirect involvement of the dreaded Marcos gang, instead will not only make Zandulal suspect for the homicide of Minister Sanyal but also be on the run from the police for theft of diamonds.The movie is offensive too.The direction is bad. The music is passable.The story is idiotic! The sole reason why this move gets a 1 star is for the tremendous performance given by Paresh Rawal and Sanjay Dutt.While rest of the actors only scream,scream and scream.On the whole No Problem is disastrous!" 
" Anees Please don't repeat this mistake again","Anees Bazmee made his directional debut with Gopi Kishan which was awesome then he went on doing good movies like No Entry, Welcome and Super Awesome Movies like Singh Is Kingh but Anees Bazmee made his biggest disaster film last year aka No Problem. I had high expectations from this movie, it looked good, the promos and trailers looked superb but I think the crew only worked so hard for the trailers and the promos only. The movie was absolute nonsense. Random things add after one or two sensible scenes, acting is not acting, it is shouting and overacting except Sanjay Dutt who did good. The story was like many random events put together and the comedy is like someone trying to tickle you to make you laugh. Bollywood made many bad movies like this last year but this year is better with more action and sensible movies. Anees Bazmee's Thank You was better than this. The movie got the most negative views, more than Tees Maar Khan the biggest flop of 2010. I have never seen such bad performance in my whole life. Hopefully, Anees will make more better movies."
