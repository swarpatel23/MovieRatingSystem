" Blue Streak","David Dhawan is known for making success with borrowed concepts, Chor Machaiye Shor was a remake of Blue Streak(1999) however this time he didn't chose his regular actors but went for Bobby Deol, Shekhar Suman and also those days DD films were not working he had 3-4 flops in a row from Kyo Kii Main Jhuth Nahin Bolta, Hum Kisise Kum Nahin, Yeh Hai Jalwa Chor Machaiye Shor borrows from Blue Streak but adds own masala, Bipasha's track was played by a male in that film, we have typical DD formula with nonsense, plus an added track inspired from Golmaal(1979) and DD's own Coolie No.1.etc However the film isn't as funny except some scenes. The second half goes on and on, with the Paresh Rawal lookalike thrown in, there are several stupid scenes like Bobby blasting an ambulance with a remote control.etcDirection by DD is good Music is okayBobby Deol tries hard to get into a comic role, he is quite good though he overdoes at times Bipasha Basu is okay, Shilpa Shetty doesn't have much to do Shekhar Suman and his 6-7 different get ups do get overbearing but he does have his moments Paresh Rawal is decent but does annoy at times, his lookalike was not required. Ashish Vidyarthi and Rajat Bedi are okay, Om Puri is hilarious in his role, rest are okay" 
" Copying Streak","This movie is copied from the Hollywood production BLUE STREAK. I must say, it is a poor reproduction. The hero plays his part well but the introduction of two girls does hurt the film.Om Puri is excellent as the suspecting cop as is Paresh Rawal as the unsuspecting commissioner. Shekhar Suman is useless as the friend of the hero. Actually this part has been "INSPIRED" from the legendary GolMaal.Suman plays the hero's mother to the cops in order to protect him. The hero also invents a twin brother, a la GolMaal. But again this hardly puts any extra laughs.Overall the movie is unbearable and I haven't been able to sit through it twice. I really still don't know how it ends. But it too must have been copied from somewhere." 
" Chor Machaye Shor is Fulltoo-Timepass comedy-- Maharishi Verma","The year 2002 was very bad for the David Dhawan because he gave back to back flop that year--Yeh Hai JALWA ,Hum Kisise Kum Nahin,and Chor Machaye Shor.But I must say that the CMS is the better film than two.That time some critics called it a copy of Blue Streak , but I want to tell them that only the basic theme of the film is same and nothing.And I want to inform all IMDb users that the Blue Streak was not so funny.So, don't compare this flick with that film,the Hollywood comedies are different from Bollywood.In every Hollywood comedy flick you will find a kind of vulgarity, even in a family comedy.Now, come to the point before his arrest Shyam a thief manages to hide stolen diamond in a construction site.After 2 years the site is now a Police Headquarter so, Shyam becomes a police officer to regain his diamond. That's the only copied element from the Blue Streak.Performances wise Bobby Deal does very well as a thief ditto for Paresh Rawal and Om Puri.Heroins doesn't have much to do.Songs are enjoyable.Shekhar Suman has his moments.Bobby deal and Om Puri's chemistry is good.Rajat Bedi and Aashish Vidyarthi is likable,same for Rajpal Yadav.Don't try to find any logic you will be disappointed.To be entertained, give it a watch."
