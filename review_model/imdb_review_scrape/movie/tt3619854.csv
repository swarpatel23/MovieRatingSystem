" Creature: A Deja Vu experience","My take on "Creature 3d Movie"Upon being spotted 'the creature' successfully bewildered our innocent Bipasha Basu and the other rookie actor, (Whatsisname?), sparing the viewers from the much awaited "Mega surprise". The first impression is that the director got successful in genetically modifying the Lizard of 'the amazing Spiderman fame' to grow mustaches or maybe the retro creature might have picked up the 'Desi Tadka' during its Indian Safari. Viewers were highly disappointed with the epic failures encountered during the movie such as Creature shares some common genes with the stray dogs as it charged instinctively at every moving vehicle.Creature was humiliated by Bips by slam shutting the door on its face at least 7-8 times. The hope was still alive but when our rookie actor learned the trick then it was devastating. During the face off with Bips-Rookie Duo the creature runs at 3 km/hr that Bips or even the rookie actor manages to outperform the low- life anytime of the day (that too on foot). Dial Maneka Gandhi ! The creature was manhandled!!! The rookie actor amazed the viewers with his driving skills by tossing the creature in air mercilessly upon impact with his car. Mukul Dev in a desperate attempt to intrigue the viewers by tagging the creature as "Brahma Rakshas" helped the viewers to lose their faith further. -Either the creature had a peculiar taste or he had some stomach issues because he never consumed the full body. Maybe the creature wanted to be recognized as a 'serial killer' by leaving a trail of rotten body part of its victims. The limited Vocab rendered the creature dyslexic that often he screamed "Waaah" or "Woooooow" upon catching the sight of Food. Finally the creature died upon receiving the sacred bullets dipped in the holy water of "Pushkar", discharging from the "double barrel" rifle in command of Bips. The double barrel gun surprisingly needed to be reloaded only once before the final shot after firing 6 bullets in vain. It made us feel that the creature was keen to end his life upon watching the mayhem created by the Bips-Rookie Duo that he decided to fake his own death. Final Verdict – Common house Gecko lizard is still the undisputed king in the Horror Genre." 
" Watchable!","Vikram Bhatt's 'Creature' is ambitious, but its also flawed & unbelievably predictable. Sure, Bhatt creates a monster that does scare you, but a disappointing romantic-track & lack of drama, spoils the fun. 'Creature' Synopsis: A newly opened lodge in the deep forest of Himachal Pradesh, is haunted by a creature. But, the owner of the resort, decides to take matters in her hands & faces the enemy. 'Creature' begins well, with the opening sequence leaving an impact. The fear of the Creature is nicely build up, but the romantic-track involving the protagonists, is disappointing. Also, there is a lack of drama in the narrative. In short, 'Creature' only works when the Creature appears on-screen. Sadly, there isn't much of the Creature, either.The Screenplay isn't without merit, but adding a dull romantic-track, certainly could've been avoided. Bhatt's Direction is good, as ever. He creates a world of fear most convincingly. But the Screenplay lets him down. Cinematography is fair. Editing could've been crisper. Music by Mithoon is wonderful.Performance-Wise: Bipasha delivers sincerely. Imran Abbas Naqvi needs to groom himself. He's raw. Mukul Dev deserved more footage. Deepraj Rana is alright. Aparnaa Bajpai is decent in a cameo.On the whole, 'Creature' is a watchable fare, at best." 
" This Fear has No Face","Just like Ramsays in the 80's and early 90's were the pioneers in the horror genre, similarly Vikram Bhatt is creating his niche in this genre, well now with technology like VFX and 3D Format.But after watching "Creature" I felt that Vikram Bhatt has not really grown after his major hit in this genre "Raaz" in 2001. The tag line of the movie says "Fear has a New Face", well unfortunately Vikram offers nothing new to accentuate the fear other than the VFX created monster."Creature" tells the story of Ahana (Bipasha Basu) who purchases a property in a hill station Glendale in Himachal and starts a Boutique hotel. Things go awfully awry when her guests start getting attacked by a monster or Bhramha Rakshash. How the damsel in distress fights against the monster forms the crux of the story.Story by Vikram Bhatt himself and screenplay by him and Sukhmani Sadana has nothing new. It is clichéd and the first half takes enough time to build up, with sub plots of Ahana's father and his suicide and the not so happening love story of Ahana and Kunal (Imran Abbas) which basically wastes a lot of screen time in songs and the mythological twist of Bhramha Rakshah almost kills the movie and what we get is a half baked VFX driven bland script. Some sequences in the movie instead of making your jump from the seat, makes you laugh. Overall the writing has immense flaws and too dated.The dialogues by Girish Dhamija is so outdated that you feel you are watching a movie from the 90's, some dialogues are unintentionally funny like when the Kunal tells Ahana referring to bank officials as vultures, Ahana replies she is not dead yet.The narration by Vikram Bhatt is sluggish and looks dated and in many sequences you are reminded of "Raaz", Vikram Bhatt's blockbuster of 2001 which was 13 years back. I think Vikram needs to re-invent his style.Performances by the cast also do not help. Bipasha Basu who plays Ahana has a perpetual frown on her face throughout the movie and looks confused. Bipasha repeats her "Raaz" act again but she forgot that "Raaz" was 13 years back and times have changed, overall she gives a below average performance. Debutant Pakistani actor Imran Abbas as Kunal is least impressive and has only one expression for all the scenes whether it was Romantic, Sad or Fearful. Mukul Dev as Professor Sadana sleep walks through his portrayal, cannot blame him as the character was written half baked. Rests of the cast are equally unimpressive.Music by Mithoon has no soul and the choreography by Raju Khan is extremely mediocre. It is only the VFX generated monster which looks like a amalgamation of Hollywood creatures from Aliens, Predator and Jurrassic Park, is impressive."Creature" could have been India's answer to "Predator", but alas the outcome is too bland and mediocre, even the 3D format could not salvage a weak script and sluggish narration." 
" Avoid at any cost","As a fan of horror genre, I have always been curious to watch different kinds of spine-chilling and spooky films. After watching Creature, I was not scared at all and was disappointed as well.After opening a forest resort in the middle of dense jungle, Ahana( played by Bipasha Basu) is threatened with life-death situation by brahm-rakshash who creates a havoc among the tourist. From the director of horror films like 1920 and Raaz series, Vikram Bhatt disappoints once again with his lame and over-melodramatic drama. The movie does have a new concept introduced in Indian Cinema but with dose of typical Bollywood narration and unnecessary inclusion of songs will leave you unsatisfied. On the positive side , visual effects are fine with good 1st half. But they are few moments to keep you engaged. when you will watch the film, you will be flabbergasted to watch that the film had no spooky moments enough to scare the hell out of you. In fact, the movie will remind you early 80's Ramsay' classics like Purana Mandir and Veerna which had C-grade actors , blazing lights, big-old broken house. Only silver lining is the storyline and commendable performance by Bipasha Basu.Overall, a bad film in every context. Avoid at any cost. Below average 1.5 /5" 
" Typical Vikram Bhatt Horror film","Vikram Bhatt's first horror film was RAAZ when he was on peak of his career but then he kept giving flops like Inteha and finally left Bhatt camp and made independent films and flops finally his career revived with 1920 and similar films and then he returned to Bhatt camp too with Raaz 3 which was a hit. Sadly CREATURE though it introduces Vampire in Bollywood however falters due to it's repetitive storyline with the same outdated folklore which Vikram used in his recent films. The film's handling too is nothing novel or exciting except some few horror scenes.Direction is average Music is decent but the picturisations and placements too have a seen it before feeling, In fact it's similar to Vikram Bhatt's earlier filmsBipasha Basu after the dud Humshakals does her part well, Imran Abbas A pakistani actor who debuts is wooden and has lots to improve, his voice too is dubbed(perhaps by Vikram), Mukul Dev fits into Ashutosh Rana type role of RAAZ with utmost ease, Deepraj Rana is as usual, while Amit Tandon is awkward in his one scene role, rest are okay" 
" Great 3D Experience !!","As a first of its kind its awesome.. Yeah there was no scare but, it was full of thrills.. Those who think its boring must watch it in 3D.. not a cam rip from torrents.. I wonder what people expect.. its an Indian based creature, and Indian movie so the scenes, atmosphere and happenings must be according to the real culture... Those calling it "desi" must know that its not shot in USA lol.. Just a bit disappointed with the close up of creature's face specially the teeth.. but overall it was pretty well made.. Great camera work.. Best 3D.. Awesome Direction.. And Bipasha & Imran were looking at their best.. I guess we must give credit to all the team for the great work and bringing something new.. Instead of comparing it with Hollywood.. Hats Off to Vikram Bhatt (Y) Thanks !!" 
" Creature 3D is an Above Average Movie, its best for horror watchable lovers","Movie Review: Creature 3D Ratings: 3/5Creature 3D is the first creature based horror of Bollywood. Creature 3D is not up to mark, but Hats off to attempt of vikram bhatt. Creature looks good in some parts. Visual effects are excellent. Superb background score, makes movie more spooky. But not that much Scary. The Horror series which Vikram Bhatt started off with RAAZ, 1920 and SHAAPIT, continues with CREATURE. As far as the direction is concerned, Vikram Bhatt fails to scare the audience with this film. The 3D experience which Vikram has created, is excellent makes you little bit fear. But despite of all these positive features Creature doesn't leave up to mark. Something is missing.Story: CREATURE starts off with Ahana (Bipasha Basu), playing the owner of a garden resort by the name of Glendale Hotel, which is situated right in the middle of the forest. Ahana arranges the opening party for hotel. The celebrations come to a sudden standstill when the hotel staff and guests go missing one by one. Despite the repeated pleas and requests, the local police refuses to investigate in detail and declares it to be the work of a wild animal like a lion or a cheetah. That's when Professor Sadana (Mukul Dev) enters and takes charge of the situation. He explains them the creature is 'Brahmraakshas'. Ahana (Bipasha Basu) and his friend Kunal (Imran Abbas) starts fight against Brahmraakshas.Over all, Creature 3D is an Above Average Movie, its best for horror watchable lovers. If you like horror movies go get spooked." 
" Its so boringly long with all unrequired songs and unexciting sequences that the horror becomes tiring as well as funny post interval.","Posing as the new millennium's upgraded version of Ramsay brothers (of the 80s), Vikram Bhatt is now more known for his horror films instead of anything else made in the initial phase of his career. So strengthening this newly found unique status in the industry, Vikram continues to experiment within the same genre following the right vision but unfortunately fails to deliver anything exceptional when it comes to execution or in terms of thrill, excitement and horror expected from a film titled CREATURE released in 3D.To give him the credit where deserved, yes the project can be rated as probably the first mainstream Hindi horror film talking about a strange, scary creature in particular, extensively focusing on its graphical depiction involving great amount of hard-work, expenditure and skill. However the other side of the coin is that this happens to be the only merit of the film as you are not going to find it that engaging, exciting or horrifying in comparison of any other creature movie seen before.Actually a horror film revolving around A CREATURE has to be outstanding at three exclusive points in its script. First at the time of its entry, second while revealing the creature's hidden history of origin and third when it gets destroyed in the end with some distinctive trick or any other novel technique. Sadly Vikram Bhatt's CREATURE is not able to impress its viewers in any of the above mentioned points in its script and thus remains a below average, unentertaining film in totality to say it all.Stating the three points individually, the creature's entry in the film is just OK with nothing spine chilling or exciting happening on the screen. Its existential history is not explained with any kind of interesting detailing or scenes and finally its destruction turns out to be more funny than scary mainly due to the over length, clichéd killings and poor execution towards the climax. For instance, the learned professor very well knows where the devil lives in some underground caves and the exact spot too. The caves which have the entry from just a 3 feel wide hole, later can also accommodate a whole jeep moving in, just at the right moment to save our heroine. Following the set pattern of a Vikram Bhatt horror film, a weak parallel love-plot is simply there to incorporate all the average songs thrown in randomly. Plus a particular sequence in the film shows the killing of a wild leopard by some hired hunters being celebrated with a photo session so fearlessly as if its not a crime in our country running the "Save The Species" campaign from many years now. In fact this was the most irresponsible insertion in the film demanding a severe criticism.Adding to its few positives, CREATURE does manage to impress you marginally with the 3D visual effects generating a certain amount of curiosity around the huge demon having a long lizard like tale, green eyes and a manly built in the beginning. But as the film progresses further, the uninspiring artificial roar and boring, routine sequences having nothing fresh to offer completely kill the novelty of the concept introduced and one doesn't feel like enjoying the experience at all close to the interval.Post intermission it fast becomes such a long, tedious film despite having an engaging concept of 'Brahmrakshsa' which could have been the key USP of the film pulling the viewer in. The writing fails to deliver anything above the routine, the cinematography and graphics try hard to deliver the expected in vain and background music doesn't bring in those chills which one wants to feel while watching a horror film revolving around a strange creature. Besides the way they all try to kill the demon in the climax, becomes funny instead of scary due to its poor monotonous feel and the annoying length.Another major downer of CREATURE has to be the catchy promotional song "Mohabbat Barsa De Na Tu" featuring Surveen Chawla in a sensual avatar, which is no-way related to the actual project and the film doesn't have any of those sexy scenes too which are sure going to disappoint many sitting in the theaters expecting a lot more (especially from a Hindi Horror film.As the performers, Bipasha Basu doesn't look fresh but tries to give a spirited performance minus any passionate bedroom scenes. The newcomer Imran Abbasproves to be a debutant more dependent on his good looks than the skills required but Mukul Dev performs decently in the role of a researching professor, who should have been given more mileage in the script as I strongly felt. Few in the supporting cast do it over the top like the paan chewing inspector and the bank manager, whereas rest of them are simply there filling up the space.In short as the first Hindi horror film based on a specific CREATURE, this could have been a trendsetter movie with a chain reaction. But in the present format, its nothing more than another wasted opportunity to make an entertaining horror flick by a reputed name." 
" creature review","Just watched! Creature begins well but after the first 30 minutes the film becomes hilarious.I was laughing about bramarakshas and whatever else.Seriously Vikram,after a number of good films,you re making this kind of films.The visual effects were very good,considering its budget.The acting by all actors except Mukel Dev were terrible.The story was below average.Some parts were good,some terrible.Music was a strong point in the movie.Naam e wafa was the best.Screenplay was average.The backstory of ahana was good.Creature was sketched beauitifully.The climax was terrible.the Verdict. It could have been a good film but it was let down by many other things" 
" Not a good one","Poor movie, I usually don't write reviews but decided to write one just because the whole movie is so disgusting. Most of the events cant be justified as they're all quite senseless Horror is scarce throughout the entire film. Links are also meaningless, often clashing and the scenes are mostly repetitive. Overall the movie is hardly near anything one might want to watch. Length seems to be really stretched and its a two hour torture. Cannot believe how someone is supposed to watch such an awful chain of fails and to also pay for the crap. I voted this two just because the 3D visuals just might deserve a peek but not enough to keep you in your seat for that long time. A big no no to the creature." 
" Not satisfactory..","Tried to build a good hollywood style creature movie but ended up with worst movie..." 
" Good Entertainment--Brave attempt and paisa vasool","This movie turned out to be a brave and decent enough attempt from Vikram Bhatt into the foray of Indian creature features. I really appreciated his ingenuity and taking a seldom explored topic and genre and making a movie about it. One dialogue that really caught my fancy in the movie was uttered by Mukul Dev, who plays the role of the Zoology professor investigating the origins of the creature--- " You will be surprised to learn that scientists are very often fascinated by fantasies---because fantasies are often facts, waiting to be discovered." So very true! And while explaining the myth of the Braham-Rakshyas, who were once godly men punished for committing major crimes like rape and murder by being transformed into beasts " Finally, he becomes a complete animal---- with no human left inside!" The songs and music are soulful and melodious. I would commend Bipasha, as usual, for her daring portrayal of a brave career woman fighting an uphill, supernatural- laced battle. Imran Abbas does a decent enough job. The scenic beauty of the forest is awe inspiring. Once again, full marks to Vikram Bhatt for being original, uninhibited and daring. A side note though, the movie does get its inspiration from Hollywood fares like "Jurassic Park", " Bad Moon", "Dark Was The Night" and " The Ghost And The Darkness"." 
" One of the worst kind of movie","Why would I give this movie 1 star? 1. Horrible acting by most of the actors. 2. Mixture of English and Hindi dialogue is so stupid and so wannabe. Stick with your true "Aukat". Either keep all the dialogues in English or in Hindi. The stupid mixture makes it funny, you wannabe westerners. 3. Horrible screenplay and directionThe only good thing about the movie is the concept of that creature other than that everything is crap. That is the only reason it deserves at least one start otherwise it doesn't even deserve the single star for it's plain stupidity from actors and their acting skills. Entire dialogue delivery and way the direction looks is so fake. Don't even watch this movie if offerred free." 
" All the reject actors/actresses of Bollywood are in this flick.","Vikram Bhatt is a name synonymous with the horror genre. Indeed the guy has made some decent horror films over the years 1920(2008), Shaapit: The Cursed(2010), Haunted 3D(2011). These above horror films are at least worth a watch. But in this film, you wonder if Vikram Bhatt is really directing the film. It's a completely amateurish attempt at direction, unbecoming to a man who has spent a lot of years in the Bollywood film industry.The script is dull, the acting is wooden, the sound and special-effects leave a lot to be desired. On top of that, the director fails to create an atmosphere of horror, which is a key element for films of this genre.I recently saw Pizza(2014), another horror film directed by a different director, which was very entertaining and well worth the time spent watching it. Pizza(2014) feels the sort of film that Vikram Bhatt should be making nowadays. I also forgot to mention Darr @ The Mall(2014) which was also visually stunning film showing that the Bollywood Film Industry is catching up to the Hollywood special-effects standard.In plain words, this film is just a Godzilla-monster type rip-off. I have seen far better U.S. B-grade horror films which are much better than this horror film. Some examples are: It's Alive (1974), The Blob (1988), Basket Case (1982), X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes 1963(Must see film starring Ray Milland), The Stuff 1985(Another good film). There are many more such as the Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Dracula and Frankenstein films and many more British horror films spanning the last six decades.Plot of film(sometimes I wonder why I even bother...): Ahana (Bipasha Basu) opens a hotel in Glendale, Himachal Pradesh. During the day of the opening party, she meets Kunal Anand (Imran Abbas Naqvi), a novelist, and they become attracted to each other. When a couple and the hotel cook are killed by an unknown creature, Kunal decides to help Ahana.How can I sincerely and in all honesty recommend you to see this film?" 
" Horrible!!!!","Creature is a story about Ahana who opens a new hotel in a forest area.But soon things starts to change immediately as guests as well as staffs of hotel starts getting killed.An ancient creature has woken up from his deep slumber and starts to hunt humans for his never ending hunger.Who is the creature and what will Ahana do to stop the creature forms the rest of the story.Overall the plot is paper-thin,predictable and full of plot holes.The simple story could have been packed into 90 min but has been stretched into 120+ mins which feels irritating.The screenplay is too lousy.The 1st half is totally unbearable.At the starting of the 2nd half you expect that the film might pick up from here.But it soon falls into ditch and you feel grossly disappointed. The creature of the movie was too bad and unoriginal.It has been created from copying of various movie creatures like Lizard of The amazing spider man and Aliens of District 9.It is so bad that you will laugh on him instead of being scared of. Acting was terrible.Everyone overacted here.Bipasha was too bad and unconvincing.Fawad looks good but is very bad in acting.Rest of the star cast was also bad. Direction was very weak.Dialogues were horrible.The only saving grace of the movie was its music which was surprisingly good.Visuals were average. It is good to see that they have tried to show something different from routine horror films but missed it completely.It was supposed to be a horror movie but it never scares you.Not even for a moment.An epic failure...... 2 out of 10 is too much." 
" An Exciting Monster Horror with Enough Scary Moments","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 starsVikram Bhatt is like the Zen of the Bollywood's horror movies, what with him having delivered sleeper horror hits such as "Raaz", "1920", and "Haunted" over the years. Nobody even comes close to the rate at which he churns out one horror film after another in the mainstream demographic of the Indian film industry; more importantly these films are loved by most in the audience and even manage to strike a chord with quite a few critics. I, for one, feel that Bhatt consistently does a good job as a horror filmmaker and is well- equipped with all the nitty-gritty aspects of the genre. While his films might not stack up there with their more esteemed Hollywood or Asian counterparts, they certainly are leagues ahead of most gory kitsch emerging from Hollywood these days, masquerading in the guise of horror. Here he takes a shot at a completely new premise in mainstream Bollywood - the monster sub-genre of horror. Does "Creature" stack up there with some of Bhatt's best features? Let's find out!The film is set in a picturesque, serene, hilly town of Himachal Pradesh (though most of the scenes were actually shot in Ooty). The gorgeous Ahana (Bipasha Basu) opens a new hotel in proximity to a forest area – declared relatively safe by the local forest dept. - seeing it as a conducive business venture and also because she wants to leave her troubles in Mumbai far behind and wishes to start afresh. Guests being to troop in large numbers, and business seems to be heading in the right direction. But, trouble arises when the guests and some of the hotel's staff start disappearing one by one, and minuscule remnants of their dismembered bodies are found thereafter. The chief forest officer – a truly revolting and insensitive fellow - flippantly declares the deaths as an attack by a man-eating leopard or panther, which should be easily dealt with sooner or later, but as per his convenience. But Ahana, with the aid of a deputy forest official and one of the hotel's guests senses that there's more to the story – something truly evil lurking deep in the forest, which humans can't comprehend, and when the creature makes its presence felt in full view, there's no more denying the facts. Later aided by a scholar on the subject, we come to know that the said creature is called a "Brahmarakshaks" – a diabolical mythical monster awakened after geographical alterations to the region, with an insatiable appetite to devour anything that breathes.By now, Vikram Bhatt is heralded as the master of horror among his fans, and not without reason. While he might not be in the league of a Wes Craven, or Dario Argento, or even a Jonn Carpenter, as far as Bollywood movies go, he's certainly head and shoulder above anyone else taking a crack at the genre, and could even find a place among today's foreign Directors dabbling in the genre. He knows how to scare you and more often than not, his recent films do hit the mark (with the exceptions of "Dangerous Ishq" and the over-hyped "Raaz 3D") with "Creature" being no different.As co-writer, Bhatt, along with Sukhmani Sadana, imbibes the script with genuinely scary scenes and tense moments. If only they had done away with some of the unnecessary romantic bits, or at least had kept them to a bare minimum, the film would have been crisper and even more satisfying. As Director, Bhatt smartly plays with his atmospherics, locations, and camera angles to get the tone and scare elements of the movie just right. Cinematographer, Pravin Bhatt, is in sync with his son's vision, and effective uses his lighting to go well with the film's atmosphere and environment. The production design by Jayant Deshmuk and background score by Raju Rao also help elevate the mood of the film, while Kuldip K. Mehan's editing is decent. Devobrat Chaliha and Abhijeet V. Sapre's sound designing is top-notch and lends the creature with an imposing aura. The visual effects and CGI work done on the creature is also mighty impressive considering the minuscule budget; comparisons with big-budgeted or even moderately budgeted Hollywood or Asian films would be grossly unfair. The music for a Vikram Bhatt movie is once again pretty good, with "Sawan Aaya" being instantly hummable.Coming to the cast, Bipasha Basu is the star attraction here and her presence is felt in every scene she's in. The film rests squarely on her shoulders and she delivers big time, further wedging her position as Indian cinema's official "scream queen". Imran Abbas possesses questionable acting dexterity, and barely manages to hold his own in front of his experienced co-star. His and Basu's chemistry is also a major let down, which is why the film could have done with lesser screen time dedicated to their romantic angle. Deepraj Rana and Mukul Dev play stereotypical roles (not that we're complaining, even the most loved horror films can't avoid certain clichés and stereotypes) and put in effectual performances. Another standout in the cast is Bikramjeet Kanwarpal, who's perhaps the only actor besides Basu who leaves his mark on proceedings. He's almost a chameleon, barely recognizable, as the repugnant, inconsiderate head of the forest dept.This is mainstream Indian cinema's first foray into the monster sub- genre of horror, and Bhatt delivers big time, considering the constraints he had to work with. Bipasha shines in her role and the visual effects and CGI for the monster are a winner. "Creature" is an exciting monster-horror film with enough scares and tense moments to keep the audience hooked till the very end, even if it's a tad uneven in certain portions."
