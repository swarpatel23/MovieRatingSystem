" A Very Important Question","I just have 1 question. In the movie, towards the end, Shah Rukh Khan and Boman Irani enter the Safe(or locker) where the diamonds are kept. The locker gets locked and they exit through the top. My question is why can't they enter through the top considering the fact that they already had the plans for the entire building?I do not think that the writers envisaged the situation. It would have been pretty simple and slick. This goes on to show that enough thought was not put into the script.A movie of this budget and the involving the slew of big names cannot overlook such a simple fact.However, if anybody has any plausible explanation, please reach me at nishith4online@gmail.com." 
" This movie is about 6 losers who are trying to loot a bank in Dubai","I had expected a lot from this movie due to the cast it had and the publicity they did, but I had wasted my money, time and mind when I watched the movie. This movie has awful story. Comedy in the movie is nice. The vfx of the movie were nice, but the story could be made awesome, just due to story I gave the movie just one rating. I was not having a vehicle with me, I went with my family and I had to stay even after intermission. It is a hit just because of the cast and comedy ONLY. I actually had an headache after watching the movie. I don't know where is the old Sharukh who had made hits like Swades, Chak de India etc, where ever he is, I hope he comes back soon. I miss you SRK. :(" 
" F***ing grow up already","This movie depicts everything that is wrong with Indian cinema, in fact it overshadows some of the good work done elsewhere. When the likes of Farah Khan are given more spotlight than Hirwana or Mehra, you realize how far behind the general audience is.I wonder why SRK does such movies. Is he that cheap now that he does such pieces of crap for money? then you see Irani in this movie, a brilliant actor and you wonder if Farah Khan touched their feet and begged them to do this movie for her.Plus i think Mr. Bachan just died after watching the younger Bachan, Ashweriya must be thinking after watching this that she was better off marrying a clown. When you can do brilliant movies such as Guru why would you do such a pathetic movie.All in all i will say, anyone who liked this movie probably has a lower IQ than a chimpanzee.SO kindly don't watch this crap and please if you like this movie for heaven's sake get a life and grow up." 
" Worst Movie EVER","Worst Movie I've Ever Seen In my Life. Total Waste Of 3 Hours As well Money. Apart From Boman & SRK All are Do Nothing. It About some looser who become winner. This Movie Is Simply At Its Worst. What happen To Bollywood??? This is awful, Totally awful. No Logic,No Sense, Total carp Dialogues. Music Is Awful, At Some Point it feels like to quit this movie. Can say bad copy of Ocean 11 & Now You See Me. Overrated comedy with no Sense. Some Says its a Masala movie with a ITEM Number But Believe me its a waste.Story Line Is Simply RIPPED. Hats off to Farah Khan to make it more worst. Cant Write More. Do Not Watch it. Disappoint Movie. If You Still Wanna Try This then Go At Your Own Risk. I'm Not a SRK hater Or Salman's Lover. I just Giving My Opinion." 
" Watching a blank wall for 3 hours would be more interesting","I have given this movie a rating of 1 because there is no choice to rate it as 0. I cannot even waste time evaluating the story because there is none. The film has no class. Farah Khan is a business woman who dishes out sub-standard movies to suit the people who are hard-up for entertainment. This movie would be appealing to people who don't care for a plot, and who get mesmerized with lot of colors and loud music and exceptionally over-acting. Instead of a spoiler alert, I can give you a Farah alert. I would rather watch a B-Grade than this C-Grade movie. Please do not waste your time watching this mindless so-called comedy which would not even appeal to a 10 year old. Farah, please use your money for some better things and leave film making for people who treat this a work of art. Don't waste good actors like Boman, Deepika in your mind-numbingly stupid movies. I will never watch your movie again." 
" How? Why!?","How? Why?! are some of the questions that come to mind when I watched Happy New Year (HNY from hereon). There is a plot, yes, a plot made out of pieces from a lot of Hollywood heist movies that I have watched and loved. And there's a lot of Shahrukh Khan; not his acting mind you, his acting part of the brain seems to have turned off the moment Farah Khan said, "Action!" in every scene he's in and he turns wooden.Also, did you really have to have a throwback to every movie SRK was in before HNY to make this thing click? The premise was outrageous. The acting was bad and emulative of Hollywoood counterparts that you find in the movies this copied from. And contrary to everybody's opinion, the only thing I liked about this movie was Abhishek's acting (except for his snake dance!); for me, it was his facial expressions and his comedic timing actually worked!All in all, a failed attempt which still made millions in spite of its flaws (a lot of them!), bad acting, and bad casting!!One last thing - MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD - if Sonu Sood's character is capable of blasting a perfect, round hole on top of the vault, couldn't they have just gotten through there? As far as I know the "laser wall" only stops people from getting to the vault. Once you get to the vault, you need to know the exact "turns" (don't forget your stethoscopes!!) to get into it. But once you get in, it's all yours! So, why not just blast a hole on top of the vault and get the diamonds since nothing actually seems to be protecting the vault after all these hurdles!? Just my thought, although I may have missed something about this in my viewing because I had to turn my brains off after about five minutes into the film." 
" Worst Movie Ever Made","This is one of the worst movies ever to come out of Bollywood. Just because it made lots of money does not mean that it is a good movie. Most of the money was made due to huge sums of money spent on marketing and shows prior to the release of the movie. Farah Khan and Sajid Khan have the copyrights to make the worst movies in the industry. The story line of this movie is flawed. Why do they always have to characters which are bumbling, drunk, part deaf, have seizures and don't even speak properly. Jackie Shroff (Charan Grover) needed to be robbed, as he was so foolish that he couldn't even recognize Nandu as his son's double. The songs were too many, movie could easily have been cut short by at least 45 minutes. Poor direction and acting. Boman Irani otherwise such a good actor, lost on count of poor script. Vivan Shah was miscast in the movie. I don't think there is negative stars given for any movie, but to this one I give -10 stars. I am so glad did not watch this movie in the theaters." 
" Worst movie i have ever seen","Worst Movie.Boring dialogs.THIS Movie is not worth to its price ticket.Nothing new in movie.Three hours of Shah Rukh flaunting his abs and swagger gets too much to take minus a strong storyline. Farah Khan has redeemed Tees Maar Khan but Happy New Year is her most mediocre work. I am going with 0.5/10. It's a magnum opus which is pretty much hollow from within and remains an all frills, no thrills show.illogical script mixed with senseless Farah's love towards the incapable Shahrukh coupled with 3 hr duration makes the experience too painful to handle. The actors were terrible except for Abhishek who did surprisingly well. Pathetic Movie with some non-laughable 'forced' action-comedy sequences.I am Regret that I watch this awful film and waste my time you have chance don,t ever go near that film if you have little sense What happen to bollywood they making worse and worse. I think competition in bollywood that who make worse film that they just just forget. AWFUL 3 out of 10" 
" Movie was boring","Not even story, no punches, no acting and none dance except one (manwa laage) rest everything sucked in movie. SRK's eight pack is sure shot graphics and can't be done at all, it is either graphics or some implants. The Jodi of Farah khan and SRK is back but sadly nothing magical came out of it as to from their previous movies like Mai Hu Na. Unnecessary use of dialogues from older movies which were just not necessary. And did'nt understood how these bunch of non-dancers won the final, it was well understood that on humanitarian grounds they were let into finals then how did the emerged as winner at the end. SRK looks just older for the roles he is picking. But for now SEE THE MOVIE ON YOUR OWN RISK!!" 
" God Save Bollywood!","Honestly after watching this movie, one thing that struck my mind was - Since when Bollywood audience have become so dumb/stupid/senseless that they really want to watch any kind of crap these stupid film makers throw at them. Illogical script mixed with senseless Farah's love towards the incapable Shahrukh coupled with 3 hr duration makes the experience too painful to handle. The actors were terrible except for Abhishek who did surprisingly well. All in all, not worth watching at all and I really feel bad for Bollywood audience who made this movie a success which only result in many more crappier movies like these.God Save Bollywood!" 
" AWFUL!! what did i just watch?? (cringe)","What kind of crap does bollywood make these days.. SRK being such a known actor, how does he do such movies.. There is no flow to the movie. It's just random collections of scenes and dances put together. Story seems to be written by some baboon. More than the movie itself, I'm worried about Indian people who are actually running to the theatre for this crap. I don't know what they're thinking. Songs are okay as well. Acting is over the top. Entire movie is over the top. Heist is stupid. Comedy is slapstick. Edittors did a very bad job. 3 hours was pain. In short, there was not a single thing that was good in this movie. Please donate your money to some poor chap. One word to describe this movie: "CRINGE"" 
" Strictly don't watch","I recently watched Hollywood movies like Intersteller, Gravity and Dawn of the planet of the apes. The movies were awesome. Really, hats off to the special effects team. And I watched bollywood movies like Happy new year, Main tera hero, Humpty Sharma ki dulhania, Happy ending and to name a few. Those were totally bad. Nowadays, bollywood movies are losing their popularity because there is no story at all. There is no creativity, nothing. They are making movies just for time pass. If I have spent 100rs for a movie, then I expect a good story . Happy New Year is a muddled mess which has its own warm moments but as a package fails to work. Three hours of Shah Rukh flaunting his abs and swagger gets too much to take minus a strong storyline. Farah Khan has redeemed Tees Maar Khan but Happy New Year is her most mediocre work. I am going with 0.5/10." 
" Disappointing to the Core","Frankly, I had no expectations from this movie. Considering the track record of Farah Khan movies , it is better not to keep any .Sometimes you might get surprised if the movie turns out good.Well, this movie turns out to be damn squib. The plot hardly keeps you engaged. The antics of the cast just irritates you. Abhishek Bachchan is watchable though. Rest of them just bore you. A bad choice this one for Deepika Padukone.The music is disappointing surprisingly from Vishal-Shekhar. The songs are below average.Final verdict- Totally miss-able.Watch it only if you have lots of spare time." 
" A poor attempt at creating entertainment","Farah Khan lives up to to her abilities - which is non-existent. Her love for Sharukh Khan has again resulted in a movie that lacks a script at all, and something which she claims to be entertainment. Her love for melodrama and songs, has resulted in yet another disaster called Happy New Year. As she and her like minded directors always do - this movie is high on color and glamor, but has a poor script and dwells on low quality humor. Its the kind of humor which probably a low IQ person would only appreciate. Its a waste of money watching this movie. Please go and spend money on other movies. A consistent feature in such kind of movies is the minimal importance given to female actors. Deepika Padukone plays a dumb damsel in distress. I wonder why a female director would like to portray a female actor in such a light. Such stereotypical projections can only go against he case for women equality in the country. Farah please stick to choreography!" 
" horrible movie","I have experienced pain in several forms. I have seen amateur attempts at movie making . I have watched fine art films like Gunda. I appreciate tongue in cheek humor. But this movie is just a bad movie. Period. It is not a movie that one would describe as 'so bad that it is good'. No this is terrible. This is a terrible movie. I did not find it to be humorous - At ALL. I honestly do not know why this movie was made. Notable issues include- The attempt to poke humor at Saroj Khan during one of the dance sequences is terrible. God Save Bollywood!Once again Farah khan have failed to entertain, Even Tees Maar Khan was better than this. Basically, the philosophy of the film is vague and in line of the escapist Bollywood cinema. And, we are not even talking about logic yet. A brainless comedy which fails to entertain. Don't go if you value your money and time, but once again i am giving advice to people who loves movies like kick, chennai express, jab tak hai jaan etc and many other craps released throughout the year.Happy New Year is a muddled mess which has its own warm moments but as a package fails to work.Three hours of Shah Rukh flaunting his abs and swagger gets too much to take minus a strong storyline. Farah Khan has redeemed Tees Maar Khan but Happy New Year is her most mediocre work. I am going with 0.5/10. It's a magnum opus which is pretty much hollow from within and remains an all frills, no thrills show." 
" A story of robbery.............","A funny film.Commercial but completely meaningless film. Sort of "Khichdi" type film. More over the songs and SRK's fame saved the film. I just liked Boman's Acting. All the crew did their best. But I don't think making a script less film with big crew and cast with 1.5 crore can ever make change in Bollywood. But good come back of the crew. watching as an audience in theater would not be that bad. But the synchronization could be better. A masala khichdi. A spicy non-arranged film just for family fun. But is this 'Bikhra' film based on robbery is perfect as a family film?. The promo said that. However, I can't understand why the fire in SRK's shirt didn't burn him....He is not Johnny Storm right????? So some sequences could be arranged perfectly........................................."
