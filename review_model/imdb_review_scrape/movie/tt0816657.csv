" I need some weed....","...to erase the atrocious memory of having watched this pathetic excuse of a film. One of the disadvantages of visiting my parents is that I get to watch such crap. Vikram Bhatt is one of the worst directors. He's a copycat and he sucks at that. 'Speed' miserably rips off the Hollywood film, 'Cellular'. With the exception of Sanjay Suri and Urmila Matondkar, 'Speed' has some of the worst actors who give their worst performances e.g. Zayed Khan, Tanushree Dutta, Ashish Chowdhury etc. Only Urmila Matondkar delivers a decent performance but as an Urmila fan I request others to avoid this piece of trash at all costs. Even Sanjay Suri fails (but that's due to the sick screenplay). Everything about it is tacky whether it's the special effects, the songs, set designs or whatever. And, guess what, it's set in England. Vikram Bhatt should be banned from films." 
" nonsense","Welcome to the world of Vikram Bhatt, the man who was once successful and got several hits with small actors like KASOOR, RAAZ and also the multistarrer AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA and his one film with Aamir GHULAMOne sneak peak about this films are that all are Hollywood remakes and some decent ones like the once which workedSPEED is a remake of CELLULAR and that too a terrible one A look at the stars, we have the once saleable but now out of work Urmila and Sanjay Suri, then we have the flop Aftab, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and othersThe film could be a decent thriller but many problems are there The storytelling has several cringeworthy scenes like Zayed hijacking a Mobile Company and many more and the stunts too are laughable while the twists in the end are too laughable The film also took a long time to reach the theatres which looses it's sparkDirection is awful Music is outdatedZayed Khan screams, makes faces.etc what he does always Urmila is good in her part, Sanjay Suri is not that convincing Ashish Chaudhary tries hard in a negative role and he is okay Aftab is horrible and he makes you laugh in a negative role Surprising the same director gave him his only solo hit KASOOR Sophie is horrible Tanushree is a non actress" 
" Don't 'Speed' up instead it will waste your time","Actually, I am not narrating the main plot in this comment but with just 2-3 sentences I can make it a spoiler. OK here are these- Speed is just a 85% conversion of Hollywood flick Cellular into Bollywood by using the software Vikram Bhatt. Title has no match with the story, only it goes in the thriller direction. Just that!! It doesn't deserve even a single star for its imitation, imperfect casting, poor standard and predictable story. Undoubtedly now I can say that Viram Bhatt is slowly vanishing away from his director status as no any matured audience will appreciate his recent works including this. Beside him, Aftab Shivdasani too making his outlook as cartoon-comic type. Who knows how long will he last in the film industry more? Sometimes the standard in the performances and cinematography look like lower than a C-grade movie. But most supportive role was played by Zayed Khan which was somewhat identical with Chris Evan's role as Ryan in Cellular. With innocent face Sanjay Suri has no contribution in the movie as he has nothing to impress. That's why those who have already watched Cellular I advise you never to waste your time again with this imitation sack." 
" Bhatt = Rip-off","This is a rip-off from Cellular. Bad casting... Bad direction... Bad Music...And the list goes on...well there was no direction since story, scenes and setting were lifted straight off of other movie. Even fight sequence is copied. One with the mace was from Kill Bill and another one with fire hose was from either a Jet Li's or Jackie Chan's movie (i am not able to recall the name of this movie)... Stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing... Cannot expected something original from any of the Bhatts any more!!!" 
" You think you have seen the mount everest of idiotic movies???","Wait till you watch this one.... I mean even after reading this review. No other movie till date has sucked more than this one.... One thing i wont understand is that, when you are ripping off some English flick why to add your own creativity? With the amount spent for making this movie the producers should have considered buying rights for "Cellular" to be dubbed into Hindi and released the movie. They might have gotten some profits that way i guess. If there was a chance to rate this movie with a 0 i would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from Tanushree Datta and the girl who played the sidekick to Aftab. I don't know if my problem is that i have seen Cellular much earlier than this movie..... but that cant be a reason to support this movie... i could go on for hours but neither i have the time to discuss about this useless crap of a movie not i want to remember those awful scenes from the movie.....please stay away from this flick." 
" An OK movie which could have been a good movie","Speed which I believe is direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I haven't watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days, but then gets in a very boring draw at the end. I have watched this movie today on 12th January 2008 on rented VCD. It's release date is 19th Oct 2007. But still fortunately for me I didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office. So in this situation when I watch the movie, I feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director again falls in the trap for Bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance.Off course as a Bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else. But now days it doesn't matter for me, if I haven't seen the original movie. I just found the main theme much similar to 'Nick of Time' and 'Badshah'. In the movie Sanjay Suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks that he is a chef. This brings back the memory of 'True-Lies'. The only new part was the use if the phone. But that too I found out now is taken from movie Cellular. So when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clear.The things I like about the movie is its pace. As the name suggest the things really happens fast, and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes. But this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishum.The plot of the movie is also quite interesting. Three stories going parallel, one after the other. One of the kidnapping of Urmila, the other of the Zayed trying to help Urmila, and then the plan of murder of prime minister. These three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continues.But then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie. Except Sanjay Suri, none other makes any impression. This goes even for Urmila, who is always promising in RGVs movies. Due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted. E.g. the scene at the end where Urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone, should have made a good impact. But instead we just wait for the end of that scene.Other than acting, some unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie. Showing so cool villains is good for Hollywood movies not for Bollywood The background of London is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen. Especially at the end, all those dhishhum- dhishhum were utterly unnecessary. May be director has an impression that the climax in Hindi movies must have such fights. They look unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie ends.Over and all, I find the movie once watchable. If it is coming on TV or you can get it on rent its OK. But then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy. Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can safely watch other channels." 
" One of the worst copies","This is such a bad movie that I have to register in IMDb to provide the review. I guess I don't need to mention whose copy the movie is. The most simple reason why the story is stupid is when you call from fixed-line phone to mobile it displays the number and fixed-line always has an address. IMDb should allow ZERO stars for such movies. Probably it gets 1 star for it is at least a movie. I agree with one of the review people should not try to be creative when copying. If they think they have creativity then create something original. There are too many stories/characters and the main plot has no logic. I am glad it is only 1.5 hours and not typical 2 hrs movie."

Thrillers have always been his forte and his handling of the subject material is commendable this time. It's stylish and most importantly, it succeeds in keeping your interest alive. Pritam's music is Fabulous,The Songs 'Loving You' 'Tikhi Tikhi' & 'Hello' R Marvellous, Pravin Bhatt's cinematography is topnotch. The locales of London are eye-filling and give the film the required sheen. Action sequences (Abbas Ali Moghul) are well executed. On the whole, SPEED is an interesting thriller To Sit Back Relax & Watch With Full Interest"
