" A Well Made Film!","TANGO CHARLIE is in a class of it's own. It's not really a war film. It's actually an anti-war film. I'm not going to reveal any part of the story. All I'll say is that it's worth a look. It's very realistic and keeps you on the edge of your seat.There have been many war films released in the last year or so. But Tango Charlie is not like any of them. Even the reason behind the name TANGO CHARLIE is quite original for the Indian Cinema.Out of the cast, it's Ajay Devgan who leads the pack. His performance is amazing to say the least. He is very comfortable in this role and makes you feel like he's a real soldier. Kelly Dorji is another guy to watch out for. The role seems tailor made for him. Bobby Deol does a decent job. Sanjay Dutt and Suniel Shetty are excellent in small but memorable roles. Nandana Sen leaves a mark. Tanishaa is getting better with each performance.Nitin Manmohan needs to be congratulated for having the guts to make a different kind of film. Mani Shankar has done an incredible job with the direction. Surendra Reddy's cinematography deserves a special mention. Every frame makes you feel like you're right there with the actors.On the whole, TANGO CHARLIE is different. It leaves you with something to think about and is quite entertaining." 
" An episodic classic","As Ajay Devgan says in the earlier part of the film, even if the entire platoon is killed fighting the insurgency in Manipur, it may just about make it to a column on page 13 of the national dailies.The average Indian doesn't care about those dying daily in proxy-wars all across the Indian heartlands. The BSF jawans dying for that Indian, fortunately, don't care either. The rest of the movie makes you care... That is the story of ''Tango Charlie'', in a bombshell.Bobby Deol is well cast as the lead character, who doesn t need more than 2 expressions to walk through the film shock and awe. India's answer to Keanu Reeves plays Tarun Chopra (aka Tango Charlie in wartime moniker). The story traces his innocent origins as a BSF jawan posted in the jungles of Manipur to the grim realities of the war in Kargil. I am still unsure whether anyone that has seen so much blood can retain the chocolate innocence Bobby does. He looks more like an MBA suited to an air-conditioned lifestyle than the hardened war-hero. The production design takes all my awards. The producer has not flinched when it came to recreating the ravaged countryside. Be it the sylvan death-traps of Manipur or the period settings of Bengal, the riot-torn streets of Gujarat or the hostile snows of Kargil the viewer travels deep into the canvas. The theater I saw didn t have Dolby sound etc but we didn t miss anything. The visuals and soundtrack (background score by the criminally under-utilized Ranjit Barot) are enough. Direction and attention to detail by Mani Shankar is comparable to the best in Hollywood, with Indian Budgets of course ;)Cameos by Sanjay Dutt and Sunil Shetty are a delight to watch. They bring an awesome dignity to a minor role, with glimpses of their post-Kaante chemistry. They are like sutradhaars , echoing the excitement and insensitivity of the viewers to all the insanity and gore. It could well degenerate into a documentary with the heavy theme and everyday violence, were it not for the irreverence displayed by these 2 characters. They make it easier for us to enjoy the film as a film.The women, like all war movies, are required to add a third dimension to the hero. Like all war-movies, they are eminently forgettable except as speed-breakers to the narrative flow. Tanishaa is not Kajol, and that is a disappointment. Nandana Sen, however, marks her debut as the next hot Bollywood babe. Her moves on the deadly Devgan, while hiding from terrorists in a rain-soaked grotto, are not to be missed. Kelly Dorjie is the surprise gift in this box of goodies. The menacing eyes and contented smile of this model-turned-actor haunt our dreams for many nights after-wards. With absolutely no line of dialog and no time to develop his character, Dorjie has a daunting challenge to leave an impact. That he does, with a mesmerizing body language and subtle expressions that clearly display the ability and intelligence of his character. He is the quintessential Mowgli; an Olympian athlete; a teenage role model. That he happens to be a villain is a matter of circumstances. He is merely a freedom fighter and should they win, history would treat him like her hero. Seeing the fluid movements of the guerrilla slither through the jungle, it is hard to believe this is his debut film! In my opinion, Tango Charlie is a film about patriotism, nationalism and the futility of it all. Yes, there is a message. A strong one. But "Tango Charlie" scores because it is pure entertainment -- Hollywood style!!" 
" Good","Mani Shankar after a decent debut 16 December and then the biggest crap RUDRAKSH came with this filmI had no expectations from it as the promos gave away that it's a routine War film but it isn'tThe film tries to show the life of the soldiers and does a good job But?The forced love angles act as distraction and all the comic scenes involving Deol The movie is well handled and the story goes on well The Kelly Dorjee scene wherein he slashes one guy's stomach is awesome till the entire scene in the waterPlus the scenes wherein Bobby accidentally kills the father of the guy is well handledThe climax does seem contrived and also the forced commercial ingredients like songs.etcBut overall a worthy filmMani Shankar does a good job Music is alright Camera-work is greatAjay Devgan acts his part like he usually does at his best Bobby Deol shines in his role except when he is made to act like a joker He brings a nice amt of shyness, simplicity and then braveness to the role Tanishaa irritates Kelly Dorjee is awesome rest are okay" 
" An excellent probe of the ugliness of war","For the first time I am seeing a real Indian war movie. This is a hard-hitting film that exposes the brutality, the mindsets, the ugliness, and the cold-heartedness that are all inevitable and inescapable parts of war. Movies like Border, LOC, and Lakshya seem to exceedingly glorify and glamorize war. Patriotic Bobby Deol enters the army with high spirits, hopes, and ambitions to protect his country and his people. He is shocked and shattered when he listens to his comrades talk about the truth of combat and of being a soldier. Ajay Devgan's philosophy of mind over heart is interesting. All characters, themes, and arguments are very well developed. Performances are good. This film would have been better if some of the songs were edited out. (I apologize to any war veterans and soldiers if I have offended them.)" 
" Ajay's film!","I like this film! I have watched the DVD 3 times now and every time I like it better. The film to my mind is intended to portray the life of the ordinary soldier who gets sent wherever to do whatever. It honors the dead and is very anti-war in the sense that it shows how senseless and damaging war is. So right away I like that.This is not a chick flick - although Ajay's thing for the landlord's daughter is sweet and sexy! There is one really gruesome scene that I tend to fast forward through and I recommend you do the same. I liked Bobby Deol here. The director figured out that Bobby has an innocent side which plays very well to the camera and makes him quite likable. I even saw tinges of his Dad for the first time in one of the Deols....Sanjay and Suniel are good and fun in their nosy observer roles as they read the diary. Their humor together in the face of so much danger is cool.But - as the critics said - this is Ajay's film. He is just awesome here. From the beginning of the film in the way that he mentors Bobby to the very end as he stands alone on the bridge taking bullets, Ajay is a standout. Unlike INSAN where you can plainly see that he is bored silly - Ajay puts his heart and soul into Tango Charley and comes up with the kind of performances he is becoming admired for.The entire episode with the landlord is my favorite and I loved the scene where the daughter thinks Ajay is her wedding-dress tailor! He's hilarious shyly measuring her....Their semi-steamy scene in the cave is also nice. But what I like is the way he always treats her with respect and how protective of her he is, first as duty and then for love. The look on his face as she hands him all her jewelry is wonderful, compassionate and tender.Of course Ajay's last scene in the film is classic John Wayne stuff. OMG - please don't shoot him again! I actually like to slow-motion these violent scenes and watch 'how they do it' - which helps me detach a bit and just observe the 'craft'.I recommend Tango Charley for Ajay fans and for those of you who are interested in the personal side of war. This film is intelligent, well-acted, well produced with lovely camera work, neat locations, and nice songs. The gals are OK, nothing spectacular. The film is Ajay and his superb evolving talent as a creative artist." 
" Better than expected","This movie was good. Thank goodness Bobby Deol didn't ruin it, which is an accomplishment for the director. Ajay Devgan rocks once again. He does great when he's in roles which aren't too happy or cheerful. It fits his personality. Unfortunately, Devgan's character doesn't make it to the end, so we are stuck with Deol, making for a mediocre ending to what could have been a great movie.There's a few great scenes, such as where Deol chases a bus his girlfriend has boarded with his diary, as a prank of sorts, but reads his horrific diary. The scene where Deol accidentally kills a civilian and then faces the family is good too. Devgan's death scene is a bit over-dramatic, but still tolerable. Quite intense at times, it is one of the better war movies to come from Bollywood lately." 
" Movie of Decade","Great PerformancesðŸ‘Œ Great Direction and Screenplay ðŸ‘Œ ." 
" Underrated classic","Even 14 years ago when the nation was way less polarized than it is now, a film examining the ugliness of perpetual war with certain communities within India and the disillusionment with the military-industrial complex did not impress the fragile nationalism of 'patriots'. It is no wonder that this film isn't to be found even on streaming services, that have resurrected gems like 'Kidnap' and 'God Tussi Great Ho' from the same period. Much like "Green Zone (2010)" that asked similar questions about US intentions and actions in the perpetual war in middle east, neither critics nor audiences had any love for either of these films. Funnily enough, attacks on the bureaucracy are not taboo as evidenced by the success of films like 'Enemy of the State' or 'Minority Report'. It's the military that's usual sacred. Only wanted to put it out there for any fans of this film, that you're not alone. I felt both TC and Green Zone were well written, tightly plotted, very well cast (especially Kelly Dorjie in TC) and quite entertaining. Politics aside, they are competent films with earnest performances. If you get a chance, watch it and share your opinion here" 
" Life of real hero","That's true and director was able to do fantastic plot and came out with good movie. Different concept and specially the different phase of force in different zones and the challenges faced by them were shocking. Ajay was good as usual and Bobby also did well. I am sure if this movie could have real ease this time, I am sure 200 k would cross."
