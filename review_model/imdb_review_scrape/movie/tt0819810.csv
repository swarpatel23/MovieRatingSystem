" Almost a documentary","I think Madhur has excelled once again with traffic signal. Be warned this is a not your regular Bollywood movie but a very different affair. Unlike Page3 and Corporate this one walks one the edge of being a serious documentary which is almost realistic and immensely enjoyable. It does make you think how fortunate you are for not being where the characters in the movie are. Having stayed in Mumbai for almost 25 years before moving to the states, I can really appreciate the work that has been put into it. Seeing foreign locales in every second movie that comes offshore (I am sick of it), it is nice relief to see Mumbai (even if it is elaborate stage) at its raw best (or worst?). Excellent acting by everyone but a special mention of Ranbeer Sheorey(I hope I got the name right). You can almost feel the character and feel relieved that it is just a movie. I think this guy deserves stronger roles similar to this. he is by far one of the most talented new faces that has come to Bollywood. I am trying my best to not give away any of the movie because I want people to be hit by it when you see it. To make long story short - you will not feel that you wasted your money if you see this movie in theater or at home. It is much better than many of the movies that you must have seen in recent times. Madhur - take a bow - you have more talent in you than you know - just needs a little bit more polishing and then you on par with any of the Hollywood directors. Highly recommended - stark reality !!!" 
" Incredible - Better Than Any Bollywood & Hollywood Film This Past Year","Traffic Signal (2007) is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. Directed by Madhur Bhandarkar, who has taken a social stance on his movies, it is better than any Bollywood of Hollywood effort in the past year.Centred on those on the fringe and making money by begging at a certain traffic stop in Mumbai, it takes viewers on a journey in to what life is really like outside of the sugar coated, glossy depiction in other Bollywood movies. It strays from Bollywood convention but pays subtle homage to the song and dance routines that has made Bollywood a major economic force.The traffic stop is managed by Silsila, who feels at home among the poor on that street. Even bragging that he began working there at just 10 days old. He feels a moral responsibility for those there, seeing that despite being beggars, they are also human beings and have embraced this way of life. Protection is payed by all those working the traffic signal and the money is used to bribe government officials and then rest is given to a local mafioso, Bhaijaan. It also shows viewers how traffic signals are a major underground economy. Where traffic is forced in order to allow for begging from stopped cars.This movie is heartbreaking and enduring in many ways. Firstly, all of the actors are relative unknowns or from the indie circuit in the industry who prove that they have acting chops to outdo any seasoned actor. Secondly, the realistic approach gets through to viewers through clean and subtle directing and cinematography. Thirdly, the characters themselves are simple and in contrast with the rich that they beg from, shows that the human spirit is more alive in the ordinary. This movie takes you in to the lives of beggars, disabled, poor, prostitutes, drug addicts, newbies to the fringe, social workers and shop girls and even children as they try to make their living at the traffic signal. It also shows us the consequences of our actions and how one small action can affect many.This movie doesn't try to make you feel guilty. It doesn't try to preach nor does it try to educate. It is simply a movie about characters on the fringe. That is what makes this movie so striking. It just is. It is just a realistic portrayal that is so incredibly pure because the director doesn't try to make it be about enlightening on purpose. It's a natural and unforced portrayal.Madhur Bhandarkar has done many movies which take on a realistic approach, such as Corporate and Page 3. Perhaps that is why he has won so many awards for his work. What I do know is that Madhur Bhandarkar takes everything that should be different and interesting about Bollywood and actually makes it good.This movie should be India's entry to next year's Oscars, but sadly that probably won't happen as India has a history of choosing their regular fluffy Bollywood films as their official entries. Either way, I urge you to all see this." 
" Dark, revealing yet impressive truth portrayed by Madhur Bhandarkar","After profiling seedy bars (in Chandni Bar), scheming politics (Satta), high society parties (Page 3) and the business circus (Corporate), Madhur Bhandarkar now eyes the Traffic Signal. Well to start with 'Traffic signal' has portrayed the dark side Mumbai gullies .Why? Traffic signal, depicts what the relationship is between the "beggars" of the traffic signal and the politician's. Not only the politicians but also the underworld don. Its not only that about, but what traffic signals shows is how one suffers, lives, smiles, earn's money in these eerie streets of India.Kunal Khemu as 'Silsila' has done an impressive job. Obviously the dark make-up that he wears to show that he is a poor person is shown. Neetu Chandar as Rani has portrayed her character in a very tender and delicate manner. Noorie played by Konkana deserves a very big mention. Her role as a prostitute has been done with passion and complete fluency. Also a mention to the 'lady-boy' gay character who sells himself on the street.Here are oddities to the likes of eunuchs, handicapped and impaired beggars, lepers, street kids, drug addicts, and prostitutes, vendors selling flowers, fruits, sunscreens to sunglasses. Traffic signal is a tale of a person(S) who need not decide what they need to do in live but to decide how to live is these nasty streets ." 
" A wonderful and moving film!","I hesitated to purchase this movie for fear of too much realism (or over-the-top melodrama), but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it really had a lot of heart, while showing a whole side of street life that's usually invisible to the passerby.I didn't feel that the subject was being 'candy-coated' either -- much of the awfulness and heartbreak of such an existence is graphically included, and the director stated that they 'did their homework' in bringing the realities of it to the screen. Kunal Khemu is a very talented actor, so very expressive, and not afraid to show emotion. I recommend it to anyone who wants a glimpse into this part of Indian society, and maybe a partial understanding of what this type of life is like for so many." 
" Too Good","Many a times I have thought of writing a script which has all these characters. Basically Mumabi street brawls to Vidhan Sabha corridors. I could think of only separate issues like flesh trade, beggars, rickshaws etc. Madhur has done a fantastic job by showing them all in a film and the common theme is 'Traffic Signal'. Never thought that way. Brilliant.Film is fresh, intelligent, humane, tight and hard hitting. Its a lesson learned with popcorn and Pepsi. My wife kept saying "I cant watch all this" but she watched it and she finally said "what pathetic lives people live, sometimes our own lives look so meaningless". Madhur sent his peace of mind home. A six. A home run.Casting and acting is perfect. Khemu will go a long way. Rani was beautiful. It was nice to see youngsters playing youngsters in an Indian film. Love songs made sense that way. Sudhir Mishra was a treat. Konkona Sen is very good and so is Ranvir. Santosh is good. Simple actors have performed so good. Madhur is a magician. My favorite track is IDB bank. I loved it when Sudhir says "Thank you aake bol". Its nice to see a panwala who looks like a panwala or chappal wala who looks like a chappalwala. A must for all the people who think we are just about to become a superpower. Very honest cinema. 9/10." 
" If it's not true, it's a good story",""Documentary styled Bollywood Movie" Madhur Bhadarkar has created a genre in Bollywood (pity there is no one yet who contributes to it). He does slice-and-dice of an industry and shows it inside out leaving the audience "begging" for more.Traffic Signal treads the same path as Page 3. It gives an insight into the lives of beggars in India and the nexus/ cartel that we thought never exists! Just like any other corporate industry, it showcases the opportunities, threats, do-and-don't's, the hardships, the middle-men and the kingpin. It has a sugary-romance (reality check on Yash Raj movies) and an upright officer fighting for justice (typical Bollywood!).Kunal Khemu gives his best shot. The ring-leader is in gym-toned body while the beggars are malnutritioned. Explains why! Neetu Chandra does leave much impact though she had an opportunity of lifetime.Konkana Sen Sharma and Ranvir Shorey need no words for their performance. They are absolutely spot-on and probably the most convincing characters.Upendra Limaye (a Madhur's regular) was miscast this time around.Nassar Abdullah reprises his Page 3 character once again.Sudhir Mishra, sorry but you weren't the right choice. Mahesh Manjarekar probably? There are a few character artistes in Bollywood noted for their typical, distinguished, one track performance. Razak Khan, Makrand Deshpande and Bobby Darling come to Top of Mind recall.Manoj Joshi is as usual dependable.The inspector puts up a authentic performance (Mukesh Tyagi?).Next time you stop by the Traffic Signal, your eyes will not see the same." 
" The Dark Truth","After the hard hitting movies like Chandni Bar, Page 3, Corporate, now comes another realistic movie from the house of Madhur Bhandarkar. If Chandni Bar was about Bar Girls, Page 3 was about high society parties, Corporate was about Corporate Lives then Traffic Signal is about the peoples living around traffic signals.Traffic Signal is about the dark hidden truth behind the irony of peoples making their breads around traffic signals and the politics beind it. This movie shows the relation between these peoples with politicans and underworld. This shows the sufferring of these peoples in the hands of politicians for their own interests.Kunal Khemu as Silsila whose name has been derived from Silsila the movie as his father liked that movie very much. He has done justice to his role. Neetu Chandra is also impressive. Konkana has played the role of Prostitute. She needs a special mention for her passion to the role played. Their are peoples as eunuchs, prostitutes, physically handicapped, fruit vendors, newspapers & magazines etc. The relation between these peoples have been showed nicely. It is also said that most of the peoples are actually from Traffic Signals." 
" Typical Bhandarkar movie","A typical Madhur Bhandarkar flick with the lives of a small sect of professionals as the subject. The traffic signal includes a microcosm of people who derive their daily livelihoods from it. There are beggars, prostitutes, tricksters, eunuchs and others who sell clothes, flowers and trinkets who owe hafta to the Signal Manager, Silsila. Kunal Khemu, Ranveer Shourie and Konkana Sen perform as expected. Life goes on through ups and downs but the movie ends on a sad note, as expected from Bhandarkar. But the movie entertains you throughout, especially with the Bambaiyya lingo, at the same time makes you think about people you normally never do." 
" A signal that doesn't make you stop","We know very well that there exists a racket or rather a complete mafia in those shady people you get to see a traffic signals but is that system so well defined? I doubt. Another thing, is there only angels that live at signals as depicted here or are there devils too, who sadly you don't see. But further I like to add that among new age directors Madhur Bhandarkar is one person who takes up issues and characters from daily life, and has guts to give them a voice. Sadly this time, that voice is lacking.Over dramatic, too verbose, noisy, too much structured with not much development in storyline till you reach climax are few things that has taken its toll. The result a half- baked product. When you don't have much too say and have no statement to make, this is what happened to even unconventional, offbeat cinema too. Don't just put interesting, relevant characters, but rather craft a screenplay around it, then only things make sense otherwise not. The height here is even an item song to please certain type of audience. . After few scenes, the narrative becomes repetitive. The subtle and sensitive approach towards the subject is not taken. Also film is replete with tele, close shots and in absence of establishment shots, the impact falls. Not every time a narrative that works for "Page three" works in every set up.Nonetheless, there are few plus points. The film is free from any vulgarity and can be watched with family. Few scenes viz. the ones with Ranvir sheorey are nicely done. Madhur Bhandarkar still deserves a pat on shoulder for exploring topics that are away from the vicinity of rotten, commercial cinema." 
" Movie is good but could have been better","The movie "Traffic signal" was a good plot as you mentioned. But I would rather say it lacked the director's extract of every individual cast in it. Moreover, movie could have been well played with raw'ness it actually had in it. Director had tried to show almost every possible incident that we come across in a day to day traffic signal but lost his focus on the deepness of the plot . Over all I would say " it was almost over killed by too much but saved only by its subject ". The story could have been handled better if it was in safe hands. I will rate it 2.5/5. Just for the core subject and for the actors struggling to make use of their best opportunity in this movie.Dx.." 
" Decent, but doesn't work as a movie.","Very ambitiously this movie tries to deal with more plots than are usually expected in a single movie. I am sure Madhur had his hands more than full with all that he wanted to communicate through this movie. Even though the actors have done a decent job, and some pretty insightful sub plots emerge during the course of the movie, in the end it leaves one with a feeling of things having been dealt with incompletely. The movie is in fact more like a series of sketches, each dealing with a different sub-plot or idea. This feeling is enforced by the fact that it's scenes do not fit together as a tight, cohesive production. This is because even though they involve the same characters, each of them tells a very different story.Traffic Signal seems to be the perfect example where a director should have gone for an extensive treatment of all these ideas through a serialized production rather than trying to put everything into one grand movie where the limitation of time is a huge constraint. Give me this movie's reel and a pair of scissors and I'll neatly cut out about 10 different episodes that could be independently developed to create a wonderful hard-hitting docu-drama series. With how much the movie attempts to cover of the Indian society and really, also the human condition at a deeper level, I really believe it would have been served better if executed in the way of Kieslowski's work on Dekalog.6 out of 10." 
" Turning Red!","Watched it last weekend. I don't remember the last time I had such a headache after watching a movie. On a Saturday night for the second show the hall had like 25 people and 7 walked out after interval. I thought Madhur's AAN - Men At Work was far more entertaining than this debacle! he he Madhur certainly didn't have to end a terrific trilogy with this lame movie. Technically the movie is brilliant and everyone's acted well. But Kunal Khemu certainly falls miles short in emotional scenes. Ranbir Shorey is a treat to watch and did I fall in love with 'Sunami'! That boy was brilliant. I am a great admirer of Sudhir Mishra's 'Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin' and his brilliant 'Hazaron Khwahishen Aisi' which probably is Indian cinema's first political epic saga is one of my all time favourite Hindi movies. But with all the dreamy eyes in the world he cant even if it bludgened him on his face! While trying to establish shades of diaspora of characters in-depth Madhur I guess somewhere forgot an anchoring spinal story. On the whole I don't have to spend my weekend with my girlfriend cribbing in a multiplex paying through my nose to suffer a hyped docudrama. I've seen many documentaries which are better paced and interesting than Traffic Signal." 
" A very bad effort","May be my expectations were too high after watching chandni bar and page-3. The effort was no where to be seen through-out this movie.Having a good plot is not enough. The script was far below PAR, a lot of the scenes don,t glue together( most of them look to be squeezed in between)None of the actors were able to make an impression, except for konkana sen . I am still not able to digest madhur using "bollywood" style melodrama, in desperate attempt to create some effect on the viewer. kunal's dialogue delivery was mediocre, the scene when kunal talks to his folks while being taken away by the police, is the worst of all.spare your self!"
