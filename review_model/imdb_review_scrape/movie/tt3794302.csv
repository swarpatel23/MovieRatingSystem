" PIZZA movie review","Most of the horror aficionados would agree to the fact that this genre has still an untapped potential in Bollywood. In Pizza, which is the official remake of the Tamil eponymous thriller, first time director Akshay Akkineni attempts something fresh by departing away from the conventional tropes that you find in regular horror stories which makes you scream, ending up in despair .Pizza tells the story of a delivery boy , Kunal ( Akshay Oberoi) working for a local pizza joint who is constantly cautioned by his girlfriend- turned-wife, Nikki(Parvati Omnakuttan) a struggling horror novelist that he is soon gonna have a spooky encounter. Wearing a perpetual gloomy expression on his face, Kunal is not quite happy in his life as his aspirations are higher and with the kind of income, he can barely sustain the financial overload. And as his ordeal would have it , the home delivery at a pregnant woman's place lands him amidst the spirits – Kunal is trapped inside the haunted bungalow , and with a mere torch light to guide him through , he tries each possible way to escape!Relying on the efficient shock value and eerie atmospherics, Akkineni makes Pizza consistently watchable. As the narrative progresses and pizza slices get bafflingly consumed by the unknown forces , you get more and more involved with its underlying tension without finger- plugging your ears or closing your eyes. The writing is tight here and if you consider the technical aspects, the 3D effects work in the film's favor.The film devotes most of its screening time to the protagonist 's struggle to break free from the entrapment and Akshay Oberoi does holds your attention with his one-man show until the shocking and amusing twist in the closing stages. Apart from a sweet mobile ring-tone which works as an ode to the 60's noir cinema, Akkineni employs good inserts of unintentional humor for relief; Sample this – in a fit of paranoia, one character screams at the ghosts , " Chupp kar kyun baitha hai, saamne aao Darpok !!"Acting as the delectable topping to the crust, the supporting cast is quite effective. Rajesh Sharma as the superstitious and stingy owner of the joint, Hussain Dalal and D Santosh as Kunal's friends are endearing as ever. Parvati is competent and has a natural flair and perkiness. Cast as Mrs. and Mr. Ghost respectively , Deepanita and Arunodaya suffer from the deficiency of scope and make-up. On the whole, if you are game for a horror fiesta, then you must relish this Pizza. It's not great or path-breaking , but you will love it." 
" Pizza, is a slice","I stumbled upon this movie last week and figured I would give it a go.
Boy am I thrilled I did. This was my first foray into Bollywood but it won't be my last. Not being fan of subtitles and only speaking English I was a little worried but fear not my English speaking brethren.
The stars are very likable, Nikita is a beautiful actress and she did a great job. Kunal was very believable too. They made a great couple and I hope they make other movies together.
The story kept me guessing straight till the end. I won't give anything away but if you find yourself looking for something new and refreshing this is the Pizza for you" 
" Pizza Review- A crunchy, crispy and delicious pizza with lots of cheese...","Movie: Pizza Rating: 4/5I generally don't watch horror films at all. But I had been excited for Pizza, a remake of the Tamil super hit Pizza. I had known that I might have some horror and all I needed was to watch it whenever it comes on TV, since the film originally was given A certificate, while for TV, it was recertified U/A. I sat to watch this film in HD. Believe me, I loved it and fully enjoyed watching it!Pizza is a sure shot entertainer and a treat for thrill lovers. The storyline is pretty good and there is no single dull moment. Coming to performances, Akshay Oberoi is quite impressive as Kunal. His performance steals the show at various places. Others were also good. Talking about the screenplay, its quite gripping and is an edge of the seat thriller. You would surely love this tasty Pizza and would wish for more, just like me. I haven't seen the Tamil original, so I can't compare between both the films. But I would have to say that the Hindi Pizza has done a full justice to the story written by Karthik Subbaraj, the director of the Tamil original. Nevertheless, I will watch the original version soon.On the whole, Pizza is a very delightful, crisp and entertaining film, that would entertain till you finish eating the last piece, and even after you eat it. In other words, this is a truly awesome pizza!"

" Gets completely lost in the translation, so better watch the original Tamil hit to enjoy the novelty.","After watching this not so appreciable adaptation of the original Tamil hit with the same title PIZZA, I reached an important conclusion on why many of my friends are not interested in watching the actual South movies being regularly remade in Hindi Cinema. And logically the reason is that when the adaptation turns out to be so uninteresting and disappointing for them all then they are obviously forced to assume that the original might be a fluke hit with more avoidable similar stuff and nothing else. As a result they remain deprived of many great worth watching projects and the blame completely goes to the Hindi film-makers adapting such path breaking films so unimpressively.Sadly this week's 'horror-thriller-suspense' remake once again commits the same serious crime of disgracing the original and why I have used the phrase 'horror-thriller-suspense' to describe the film, would only be clear once you have watched it knowing the real secret of its ghosts as its major surprising twist.Talking about the experience of watching PIZZA as a new release (irrespective of its remake status), the film actually doesn't work since it takes too much time to deliver the much awaited spooky content, has much less to offer in terms of horror or 3D and fails to build up the tension as expected by any fan of this particular genre. The first half keeps trying to make an impact with only one character alone which becomes monotonous after a while and then the deliberately prolonged climax spoils the whole game (which is not there in the original). No doubt the novel revelation in the finale does provide you something to think about while walking out of the theater. But the huge damage made earlier never lets you praise the movie despite its interesting culmination to say the real truth.Actually the fault completely lies in the re-writing and unimaginative treatment adapted by director Akshay Akkineni who forcibly tries to add something of his own to the script unnecessarily. Particularly towards the last 30 minutes of the film, which turn out to be the major drag making much lesser impact on the viewer than it could, with a quicker and smarter climax as seen in the original. Further weak handling of two main characters in the story progression, the lead actor's spooky wife and the tantric visiting the pizza joint in the beginning, truly fail to create any kind of mysterious premise for the viewers as brilliantly conceived in the Tamil hit.The performances range from below average to mediocre, soundtrack gives you nothing to write about and cinematography despite being decent, fails to incorporate any special angles for the 3D, going against the huge expectations made from the specific format. On the other hand, background score and sound effects do try to bring you on to the edge of your seat, but it's the long lazy sequences in the film which don't let them achieve their desired results on the screen.To sum it all, PIZZA is an experimental attempt having some novelty in its theme unarguably. But watching the Hindi remake of the original is sure going to spoil the magic of its splendid suspense beautifully tackled in the Tamil Hit. The actual version is rough, raw, believable and a worth watching venture indeed for all horror genre lovers. So if you are really interested in witnessing something out of the routine then do watch the original Tamil PIZZA with subtitles and skip this lousy version of the same made ambiguously." 
" A 100% Paisa Vasool(translated: money's worth) film.","I enjoyed this film immensely. Indeed, it is shoulders high over current films like Creature 3D. One can say that this film has put a new sub-genre to the horror film. I can just say that if you've seen many horror films in your life and are often accurate at foretelling or predicting the end of the film, you are in for the surprise of your life.Even I couldn't see the ending coming. Though I shouldn't be amazed if they make a sequel to this film.The casting and acting is excellent, the script is smooth and polished. The newbie cast performs much better than older much experienced Bollywood actors/actresses which is a bonus. The sound effects and special effects enhance the film. I think this film will gain a cult-status and be proudly placed with the older Bollywood horror films.Plot: Kunal(Akshay Oberoi)is a pizza delivery boy who lives with his girlfriend Nikita(Parvathy Omanakuttan). She is an aspiring novelist and is researching for writing a horror story, whereas Kunal does not believe in supernatural powers, and is afraid of anything supernatural. Nikita, keeps telling him that he would soon realize the presence of supernatural beings. At first, Kunal is confused and scared, and his fears are confirmed when he comes to know his boss, i.e., the Pizza restaurant owner's wife is possessed by a spirit. Meanwhile, Nikita becomes pregnant, and after a brief altercation, Kunal And Nikita get covertly married. One particular day, Kunal goes out to deliver a pizza to a customer and returns to the restaurant in a state of shock while covered in blood; he is apparently injured, keeps constantly muttering Nikita's name, and seems to be worried about her. When his boss questions him, Kunal explains that he had been to deliver a pizza to a customer in a bungalow and recounts the events that happened at the bungalow.See this superb film and find out what happens next...Other Hindi Horror films: Raat(1992 Cult film), Ramsay Brothers Films: Tahkhana, Veerana, Purana Mandir, Purani Haveli, Bandh Darwaza.

" Tasteless Pizza.. disappointing horror movie","This movie is worst according to horror genre, initially movie goes well & sets good environment for horror movie, actors also seems to be good..but when actual horror starts.. it all feels like stupidity. U will get bore with so much & Unnecessary jump scares. I think.. director added jump scares only because THIS IS HORROR MOVIE...otherwise nothing Logical with movie plot...If they could have worked more on Plot rather than just stupid jump scares, than, this movie could be way more different & watchable.. They made waste of such good topic.If you are fan of horror movies like Insidious series, Grudge, The Conjuring.. Please don't waste your time for this..." 
" Good Movie","It was a good movie with nice ending. But still, it could have been better." 
" best mystery movie","This movie is quite good till last you find mystery"
