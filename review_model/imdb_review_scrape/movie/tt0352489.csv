" Movie stuck in 60s","The film was known because of it being debut of Juhi Babbar
The film however is stuck in 60s and was a flop.
The first half is still ok with twists and turns though we have seen such before. But the second half gets boring with cliches and predictable scenes
Climax also seems rushed.Direction is ordinary
Music is okaySonu Nigam in his second half is lousy, in drunken scenes he is terrible and otherwise also tends to ham and imitate Dev Anand
Juhi Babbar is excellent in her debut sadly her career didnt go much further
Raj Babbar is great, Om Puri is excellent
Sharad Kapoor is good in his part rest are okay" 
" A dear child-hood memory.","Must have watched this one many years ago with my mother and sister.(Love watching movies with them!)I remember how happy i was to watch Johnny Lever from the beginning, his characters in movies are always so funny and comical!I really liked the romance in this one, it flowed natural and the main-characters had a adorable chemistry. The plot was an exciting one too and i remember the ending being an entertaining one."
