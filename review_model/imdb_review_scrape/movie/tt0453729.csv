" Take a bow Nagesh Kukunoor","Everybody wants to see the underdog triumph. But what we Don't want to see in the process is unnecessary over-the-top pity/sympathy created for the underdog. Nagesh Kukunoor understands this. He gives us the kind of cinema which is entertaining, simple and intelligent. The plot itself is simple but it's always difficult to keep it simple and yet entertain. "Iqbal" achieves this. The moment we see Iqbal(played wonderfully by Shreyas Talpade) with his rag-tag "kit bag" slung over his shoulders,carrying it like it was his most prized possession and steaming in bare feet with that look in his eyes, we want him to win. We want him to knock the socks out of the opponent (batsmen, wheeler-dealer coaches and anyone who's in his way), we want to see the world recognize him. That's what "iqbal" does to you. Iqbal's journey ( I wouldn't call it a struggle because the triumph was in his journey) takes us into his village with its rustic dusty backgrounds, buffaloes named after cricketers and a drunk ex-almost-was Naseeruddin Shah, not to mention his family. Shreyas Talpade holds his own against Naseer who seems as though he just woke up drunk in a haystack and carried on from there without knowing there was a film crew around him. Shweta Prasad as Iqbal's sister is just gifted, she brings a maturity to her character which is beyond her age, outstanding. The cricket part is handled very effectively and doesn't look amateurish.The dirt behind the selection process, you-help-me-i'll-help you situations is shown well although Kukunoor solves it simply as well. It might just be a tad more complicated than that in the real Indian cricket world. Nagesh Kukunoor seems to be growing as a film maker with each movie. His "Teen Deewarein" was splendid and Iqbal is a step further in the right direction. He has handled the potentially could-have-been-overdone story to a nicety and manages to bring out the emotions without the usual " look at me, i'm all pitiable and lovable" stuff. Iqbal isn't pitiable, but he sure is lovable." 
" Remarkable, Outstanding, Astonishing and Unpretentious","An inspiring and thought provoking tale of a specially abled lad's passion to realize his only dream of being part of the national cricket team. This is a gold dust of cinema, one of the finest you would ever come across by. Indeed, Nagesh Kukunoor deserves a big round of applause for this spectacle, a feat that he successfully achieves in his next project (Dor) as well.Anybody among us can dream big but those who realize those dreams are the special ones, right! And what would you call that person who has been written off by many since birth and yet goes on to achieve what he has always dreamed of? EXCEPTIONAL; maybe it is an understatement but yes.As they say, behind every successful man there is a woman, and well Iqbal (a very challenging role portrayed with ease and grace by Shreyas Talpade) had two backing him in his endeavor, his mother and his ever supportive and caring little sister, Khadija (a character brilliantly portrayed by Sweta Basu). Obviously family support is good for moral boost up but it just isn't going to be enough without a well drunk, sorry! a well experienced coach (Nasseruddin Shah's portrayal of this character is surely going to have a lasting impact. He lightened the screen every time with his presence. Pure brilliance!).And for all those who have started to question their choice of watching this movie because of the fact that you do not understand cricket, then let me just tell you - You don't need to understand cricket at all to enjoy this because becoming a national cricket player is used as a synonym in this movie for a dream that is just too big in the eyes of the society for a lad like him).I watched this movie when I was a teenager and I have to admit that this movie forever changed my perception of cinema. So, if you are feeling low, dejected, hopeless or having any such kind of thoughts about quitting on your dreams, I urge you to watch this remarkable piece of work.You would never want to quit on to something that gives meaning to your life." 
" A great feel good movie","This is all about chasing your dreams, no matter what the obstacles. The movie is funny in a subtle way and the acting is brilliant. It is rare that such gems come out of the Indian Film industry. Overall a refresher amongst the crap which normally plays in theaters.The story involves a young deaf and dumb boy who is crazy about cricket, and how he hides behind buffaloes to watch a coaching camp and learn bowling. Eventually he finds a teacher in a failed cricketer(played by Nassiruding shah) who leaves his drinking habit and makes it his personal battle to place Iqbal in the Indian cricket team.This movie also touches upon the corruption in the selection system and commercialization of cricket." 
" exactly what the abundance of word of mouth asserts - the best movie of this year.","Watched Iqbal yesterday. Yes, this movie is exactly what the abundance of word of mouth on it asserts - the best movie of this year.I don't think this is a great movie, it's just that it is so rare to see a film that works in Bollywood, which does not come from a masala genre, that works simply as a straightforward story - that this film looks all the better compared to the awful field it competes with.Iqbal brings a smile to the face and a tear to the eye and a lump to the throat and a racing of the heartbeat in slight twist and sweet turn and more than makes up for the time and money it takes to invest in watching a film - much more than that.Nagesh Kukunoor's minimalist narration (enhanced by rousing music by the creative genius duo of Salim Sulaiman) that we saw in his earlier films is here perfect - the rustic ambiance of the film seems to pervade the storytelling too.The film reminded me of Million Dollar Baby and Shwaas at times - MDB, because of the minimalism & struggle against odds; Shwaas, because of the sweetness of the tale.Lovely, lovely film." 
" Funny and inspiring Fairy tale","Iqbal is all about a young village lad in northern India, who eats,sleeps and thinks cricket. His only goal in life is to play for the Indian team. A few obstacles in his path, he is deaf and dumb.. He is poor and cannot afford standard training. His father is not ready to let his son ruin his life in pursuit of a day dream. He does have a few strengths. He can bowl real fast, and has great support from his mother and sister. There is also a village drunkard (ex-bowler for the state team) who will be coaching him. The story here is about how he fights all odds. While the story sounds very normal and often repeated, it is the taking of the movie that is brilliant. The cinematography is very simple. The rural village setting reminded me of the village where I grew up. The dialogues are witty and realistic without any dose of melodrama/sobs/tears. They seem to be inspired by "The Alchemist". The background score and the song are cool, and flow with the movie. There is no self-pity or "I-am-disabled-sohelp-me" kind of emotion. In fact, his disability ceases to be a factor within 10 minutes of the movie. The movie is very inspiring and entertaining. The acting is first rate. Nagesh Kukunoor (director) makes a good movie about cricket and great movie about "How not to give up what you like?"." 
" Must watch movie!!","Iqbal is not exactly a award-winning work but it is definitely very well-made with the typical Nagesh Kukunoor stamp on it. After Hyderabad Blues, Bollywood Calling and Rockford this is the fourth movie from Kukunoor that I have watched and appreciated. Kukunoor has the knack of picking up the simplest possible theme and turning them into beautifully narrated stories studded with mundane incidents interwoven into a coherent theme. The key is the treatment of the story which Kukunoor executes in a truly unique style. The focus is never on the message; in-fact one can hardly draw a message from any of his movies. Instead what comes out of his movies is the joy one can draw from insignificant everyday events, the little pleasures of life. They seem to emanate the aroma of life often transporting you back into your past, reminding you of the childhood dreams, adolescent crushes, and the dilemmas of youth. The protagonist in each of his movies is an individual on the path of some sort of self-discovery. While Hyderabad Blues saw a NRI returning to his roots in India only to get more confused, in Bollywood Calling a Hollywood actor finds the strength to fight cancer while working for a B-grade Hindi movie. Rockford went into the psychology of a boy who is getting exposed to the vagaries presented by the transformation from childhood to youth. Iqbal is a similar tale though much larger than this. It talks about an ordinary young man, someone who is simply unexceptional in the normal sense except for his talent and undying passion for sports. That this game happens to be cricket is not important; the movie would have remained the same had it been built around some other sport. Though with cricket being at the center stage, the movie is more likely to attract the Indian audience. Another twist thrown in is that the main character, Iqbal (played by Shreyas Talpade), is deaf and dumb. This does not contribute much to the storyline except increase the complexity a bit. But it does sharpen the contrast between the underdog and the privileged. Secondly, while giving out the message that "impossible is possible", the 'impossible' is much more accentuated. It also challenges our preconceived notions regarding the physically handicapped people. Lastly it also adds some drollery in the storyline. Here I must stress that though from the face of it the movie appears a heavy, gloomy portray of the struggle of an underprivileged,this is far from true. The plot, the characters and the ending have a very unconventional touch and in the end it leaves one with a positive feeling. The story is about a young man Iqbal living in a village with his parents and a younger sister. Iqbal is deaf and dumb but he has inherited the determination and resolve of his father. He has also inherited something from his mother- a deep love for cricket. And this is not just empty craze. Not having been able to get good education and being forced to work with his father as a farmer, he has somehow been able to give vent to his love for the game by practicing it all alone, with buffaloes as the only audience!! His only learning has happened through eaves-dropping on the coaching sessions at the nets run by an esteemed coach (Girish Karnad), with the lessons translated by his sister into sign language. The routine continues till one day Iqbal's sister gets bored of the 'translator's job' and approaches the coach with the request of taking his brother in his academy. The coach holds an entrance test of sorts and is impressed with the young man's raw energy. This starts the grooming process for Iqbal as he starts to learn the art of fast bowling in the academy along with several other students. But as it turns out, Iqbal has an ego-clash with a fellow-student who was the son of an influential person and was thrown out of the academy. Hope turned into despair and Iqbal slowly started giving up the dreams of playing cricket. And then one day he discovered another guru (played by Naseeruddin Shah), a drunkard who at one time had been a promising player whose career never took off all because of the dirty politics played by his coach, the same person from whose academy Iqbal was ousted. He is the only ray of hope to Iqbal who insists on learning the game from him despite refusal. The coach finally relents even though he is not sure what to expect out of all this trouble. But the subsequent experience takes both of them to a challenging journey where one has to face the resistance put up by his oppressive father who is totally opposed to his son's involvement in the game and the other has a mini-battle of sorts with his habit of drinking and also has to fight with the baggage of his own dismal past. In the end after a dramatic turn of events Iqbal manages to get selected to the national cricket team, in the event beating his jealous opponent of the academy and the trickery of his former coach. The film ends at this point and I must admit that this is one of the most well-timed endings I have seen lately. The film has lot of memorable scenes and dialogs, my favorite one being when, during a conversation with the alcoholic coach, Iqbal's mother says nonchalantly that if her son is not selected for the Indian team then "I will kill you". The background score is good though not brilliant. The cast of the film seems to fit the bill perfectly. Shweta Prasad, who plays Iqbal's younger sister, is an amazing child actress. I have earlier seen her as playing the roles of diametrically opposite twins in another Hindi movie Makdi. Naseeruddin Shah and Girish Karnad are brilliant as are Prateeksha Londkar (Iqbal's mother) and Yatin Karyekar (the father). All in all a wonderful film." 
" iqbal-a winner","Iqbal doesn't require those plain, ch..ya reviews but aggressive reviews. Call it a bouncer, a sixer, a century, whatever. The experience is as exhilarating. Welcome new cinema. Welcome Iqbal. A movie devoted to a criminally ignored aspect of cricket called bowling with so much of spunk, style, freshness, novelty and surprises that even those not interested in game find it simply irresistible. It has all the aces. Firstly, amazing stories and people happening in small towns too who are crying to be a part of mainstream but nobody really took notice of them. No need to add situational/ item numbers (read non situational)songs or beautiful bimbettes in the name of "heroines". Instead a brother-sister combo is remarkably portrayed. And when it starts talking cricket-the game, the passion, the technique, the struggle, the pain, the politics, the victory, everything beautifully woven interspersed in between in subtle humor such that it all looks as real as life itself in flesh and blood. The honors should equally be shared by background score, songs, cinematography, editing (especially), sound design and script. All performances are first rate. Ultimately, and at last a director's film-Nagesh Kukunoor's best among his six and not to forget a superb one coming from producers mukta arts years after. Three cheers. Now few Grey areas. The film slightly looses its crispness in certain parts such as-Iqbal trying hard to get Naseer to coach him; the struggle Iqbal went through after inducted in Ranji Team and lastly the film ends on a slightly abrupt note. But all these are minor diversions. Lastly, a word of advice to established set ups tried and tested, star-studded, NRI romances format of film making. Please step aside. Your turn is over. A New dawn has set. A New player in the offing. Indian films finally finding their identity. Undoubtedly, the best film released so far this year, year 2005 will be remembered for Iqbal and likes. And Box office. F... box office. To those conventional distributors, being a modest budget film it is an easy break even so you GTH (go to hell) Also, if Tax free status is not granted sooner to this film then it is better to abolish this system of promotion via tax-free. Jiyo Iqbal !" 
" Inspirational.....soul food I tell you","Iqbal has to be one of the best movies India has had to offer yet. I was so glued to this movie that I actually finished it in only one sitting. It is a Highly inspirational movie which tells us that ever dream no matter how impossible it maybe is worth putting a Fight for. Shreyas Talpade the Guy who played Iqbal did an awesome job. The expressions on His Face and the way he Protraied his character was remarkable. He did not even have a word worth of Dilogues in the whole movie but is expressions and character portrayal spook a million words. Naseeruddin Shah has once again proved himself to be a remarkable actor... I was beginning to think that Haseeruddin Shah was moving downhill post the LXG fiasco but I have been proved wrong with his remarkable performance in this movie.People get You hands on the DVD of this movie ASAP..It will be worth every second ." 
" Let The Movie speak for itself","When you come inside a theater at the end of the movie you want to go out feeling good, happy and this is what Iqbal did. A deaf and blind boy practicing, achieving his goal, striving for it was beautiful and at the end the triumphing of Human Spirit. Let the movie speak for itself go watch it. I have to write 10 lines and i will. Step 1- Go to Video Store or Theater Step 2- Rent or buy a ticket for Iqbal Step 3- Go home and watch it or watch it in the theater Finished Watching It????????????????????????? Step 4- Go to your home and say that this comment was useful as i told you to watch one of the most amazing and inspiring motion pictures Bollywood has ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" 
" Very classy Flick","I went to this movie just today. I heard great reviews from everybody and I finally watched it today. Nagesh Kukunoor has the knack of coming up with some good films, especially off late after Teen Deewarein(Which was brilliant). This movie I think is another feather in his cap. This story is about a deaf mute, Iqbal (Shreyas Talpade), who lives in the small village of Kolipad and dreams of becoming a great cricketer. His father is totally against his love for the game but his mother and sister push him towards his dream. Iqbal is first coached by a devious Girish Karnad, who ditches him for a rich kid. His only refuge is the village drunk Mohit(played brilliantly by Naseeruddin Shah), a former Ranji cricketer. The relationship between Iqbal and Mohit is beautifully brought out on screen. Iqbal's sister (played by Shweta) also gives a brilliant performance. But the cherry on the cake belongs to Naseeruddin Shah. His charm is infectious. He breathes life into the character of Mohit with effortless ease. Shreyas Talpade has also brought in a very good performance. He has really emoted very well and has done justice to his role as the deaf mute. The actor playing Iqbal's father also does a very good job. I think this movie is for the masses as well as the classes. It will be enjoyed by one and all. As the movie's bylane rightly puts it. "It is a story above Cricket."" 
" Iqbal the best movie in the world","I think Iqbal is a class apart movie n it deserves awards .I agree that Black was a beautiful movie but just see the simplicity in that film.The cast was just the best:-) 1 Shreyas Talpade was a class apart actor the way he did that role was beautiful.The scene where he cries because he is thrown out from the cricket academy was the best.You Rock! 2.Shweta Prasad really made u laugh n enjoy the movie.Her relationship with her brother was very good. 3.Nasserudin Shah deserved an award for this performance.Simply class apart.But as they say the world is not always fair On the whole the actors n last but not the least our very talented director Nagesh Kuknoor deserve a thumbs up for the movie May your next movie be a bigger hit. lots of luck Nonie" 
" A cricket Saga","IQBAL is an excellent movie by Nagesh Kuknoor. His earlier film HYDERBAD BLUES was also good film thematically and in characterization.but had rather loose screen play. But this time he has written a very tight screen play and he has chosen excellent actors . It is a story of an aspiring bowler in a village. This shows clearly that to reach the top is not a plum to be taken but to shed sweat and tears. The relations ship between the deaf and mute bowling aspirant (Shreyas Talpade) and the school going sister(Shweta Prasad) was etched beautifully. In some scenes the film reminded me of that excellent Iranian film "The Children of Heaven" by Mohammad Amir Naji. The boy takes the help of an old cricketer who has gone to seed and Nasiruddin Shah etched this role beautifully as Mohit. The story is down to earth with father not very happy with what he thinks unattainable ambitions of the son but the boy is strongly supported by mother and sister. The ambiance was typical village atmosphere and the house a normal village Muslim family -may not be affluent but not below the poverty line. This is a family drama not the rubbish those come out of Kollywood. All in all a memorable film and Kuknoor graduated to almost world class.The film I remember was sent for Oscar. Though this was not nominated Kuknoor is approaching Oscar level." 
" A Simple Heartwarming Story About Hope And Glory","'Iqbal' is a charming down-to-earth film directed by one of today's finest directors Nagesh Kukunoor. The story revolves around a deaf and mute young man who dreams of becoming a cricketer. It boasts of a talented cast that includes Naseeruddin Shah (awesome), Girish Karnad (very good), Shreyas Talpade (natural), Shweta Prasad (natural), Yatin Karyekar (decent) and Prateeksha Lonkar (sublime) all delivering memorable performances. Cinematography is excellent and gives a realistic spacious feel to the village setting. Music is awesome and background score is very pleasant as it contributes to the mood. I especially like the uplifting song, 'Aashayein'.On the downside, Kapil Dev's appearance is annoying as he can't act and his presence doesn't add anything. Some may feel that the story has been done numerous times before but in my opinion Kukunoor's treatment and execution gives it a unique touch. For example, I loved how he portrayed the relationship between the mother and her children and the two siblings. The chemistry between the actors only make their interactions more real. This is also one of the few films that focuses on the sibling relationship. Iqbal's sister is not the typical Bollywood 'behen' who runs around screaming 'bhaiyya bhaiyya' (brother brother). Actually all the characters are very well written.'Iqbal's main strength is its soul. This is a must see for everyone and one that can be watched with the family. It's an uplifting movie that brings a smile to the face. Always believe in your dreams and have faith in yourself to make them come true. And to parents, always believe in your children's dreams and capability. That's 'Iqbal'." 
" Neat and simplistic take on life","This movie builds up a nice ethos by using a child protagonist as main character. That he's a budding cricketer who has to overcome a physical handicap along with the nearly impossible overall odds of selection, only adds to his sparse attributes and makes him even more endearing.Having said that, the movie could have taken it up a notch in certain places where it loses steam. For instance, its bad enough to convince a coach, let alone an ex-cricketer who's an acknowledged loser, to get up and give you lessons. BUt there's more than one way to skin the cat. In most cities, towns and villages all over India, what is practiced is a sport called "galli cricket" (playing in a lane or road with zero or no traffic). That is how many a cricketer (Sachin?) was born. Very few of the youngsters have access to proper coaching, let alone an academy.The plot seems to have been based on Shwaas (little boy's final hurray before sinking into darkness) and Bend It Like Beckham (battling all of the usual resistances). However, Iqbal shines on its own merit and had there been a wider percolation amongst the cine-going audiences, in all probability it would have been a winner at the BO too. Although its a low-budget picture, it doesn't seem to scrimp on technical aspects nor on production values. But the Muslim angle was unnecessary. Again, its triply impossible for a minority, deaf-and-mute, village kid to chase the dream that Iqbal does.Some scenes and dialogs (state selection process) remind you of Kevin Costner's "Field of Dreams". Overall, its an enjoyable film. Well done, Nagesh Kukunoor, after Hyderabad Blues, Teen Deewarein, etc. In movies as in cricket, what matters is a unique style, pace and rhythm." 
" Unabashedly manipulative, but still has a certain charm","Writer-director Nagesh Kukunoor clearly was inspired by John G. Avildsen. Watching "Iqbal," it doesn't take one long to realize that this film takes elements of Avildsen's "Rocky" (1976) and "The Karate Kid" (1984) and mixes them with India and cricket.It helps a little bit to know something about cricket. At least, to know about the obsession young men growing up in the Indian subcontinent have about the game. Students skip school to watch international matches. Transistor radios come out in full force to listen to commentaries. And you can see crowds gathered outside TV stores and on corners watching or listening to the game."Iqbal" wears its heart on its sleeve and isn't ashamed about it. There's nothing particularly novel about this film. You know exactly how it will turn out - after all, it is a feel-good movie. But still the film has a certain undeniable charm.The film lacks the sheer giddiness of, say, "Lagaan" (2001). But "Iqbal" is buoyed by some pleasant performances, interesting characters and it can't help but bring a smile to your face. Shreyas Talpade is awfully convincing as the titular character, though he is given to moments of over-acting, especially during crucial scenes when Iqbal finds his dreams fading away.On the other hand, the film's best surprise is the performance by Shweta Prasad as Iqbal's little sister, a young girl who makes it her goal in life to ensure her mute brother fulfills his dream. It's young Prasad who brings the film to life. She gives her character the right amount of spunk and attitude; there's nothing unnatural about this young girl's performance. She's funny when she needs to be, serious when she ought to be."Iqbal" is all about making the audience feel good about itself. There are no real surprises, plot wise, in the film. There are the usual villains, just as there were in "The Karate Kid." In "Iqbal," it's the cricket academy coach and his star player, Kamal (Aadash Balakrishna). Notice parallels to Avildsen's drama?Even the ending is a foregone conclusion long before it arrives. But Kukunoor handles everything with such care, it's obvious he loves this clichéd and predictable story."Iqbal" warms the cockles of your heart and, occasionally, that's not a bad thing for a movie to do." 
" Certainly not your typical Indian film.","Iqbal is a young deaf man in this film. Despite this, he has a dream to one day play cricket--a national obsession in his native India. But he's never played on a team and his father doesn't want his boy 'wasting his time' playing sports. So, with his little sister as his interpreter, Iqbal works hard to hone his skills and try to get a break. He is able to get one of the important coaches in the country to see him, but this coach turns out to be very politically motivated. So, even though Iqbal might be the best, he won't give the guy a break. So, it's up to Iqbal to get someone else to train him--and all he can find is an alcoholic ex-player. Can Iqbal defy the odds and find a place on the state or national team?In some ways this is a very unconventional film. After all, the story is about a deaf guy. But, it is VERY conventional in most other ways--with the various controversies and hurdles Iqbal needs to overcome, it sure seems to follow a very traditional sports film formula. However, it's important to point out that you don't need to understand cricket (after all, NO ONE understands the game outside of the nations where it's played). Also, while I am reasonably fluent in sign language, I couldn't follow most of the signing. Either they use a different system in India (the most likely answer) or the actors are signing nonsense-- I'd love to know which is the case. I do know that the British system (which probably influenced the Indian one) isn't much like American signing."
