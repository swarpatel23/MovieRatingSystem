" Expecting a thriller from Ekta Kapoor is like expecting dance from Sunny Deol or an original score from Bappi Lahiri","Expecting a thriller from the director who gave you such sloppy television soaps like 'KKusum' and 'Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki' is like expecting dance from Sunny Deol, acting from Kareena Kapoor or an original score from Bappi Lahiri. And I Know What he Did Last Summer. Ripped off a Hollywood flick and is now claiming that chill will run down spines this winter. Rather snores ran down nostrils. And he's not the only one to be blamed coz EKKta KKapoor's concept of thrillers are sadly restricted till 'Kahin Kissiiii Roz' only. Pity Pity!!! So there's this college in Shimla (which looks like Switzerland) where psycho professors are appointed. A group of six friends accidentally run down their van over this psycho. Seized by guilt pangs the friends get separated. Three years later they reunite but the psycho is back and on a killing spree. (Now why did the killer wait for 3 years?) The essence of a suspense flick lies in the fact that the actual killer must turn out someone quite unexpected and not the usual suspects. But this movie miserably stumbles at the point where the identity of the killer is revealed. Moreover the climax where the murder mystery suddenly turns into a love story of an over-possessive woman (ala Gupt) is disgustingly disappointing. The director pathetically transforms the thriller into a triangular love story (the KKusum effect), stuffing it with a dozen redundant songs (which you have been hearing since the past few weeks on every K soap). The only mystery in the movie is that it starts with a flashback but you never know where the flashback ends.It's still difficult to differentiate Tusshar from the junior artists in songs. And somebody please tell him that cowboys should dance around horses (and not cows as he does in the Ding-dong-Ding song, taking the term cowboy too literally). Esha's emotions still gives you loose motions.So there's not a single department worth appreciating in this film, except for the slickly designed promos which successfully fool the cine goer. But guys, Dikhavo pe naa jao, apni akal lagao. Yahan, Kucch Nahi Hai." 
" Hideous","Ekta Kapoor's serials are so stupid,illogical imagine her films???This is a remake of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and it's crap The film tries to mix a suspense thriller with romance, music, comedy and the result is badThe thrilling part is bad and also the romantic partThe film looks like an amateurish stage play The entire suspense angle is forgotten in the middle and the end is completely different and isn't handled properly Direction is weak Music is decentTusshar looks like a small kid acting, Esha is okay Natasha sucks Rishi is okay" 
" We know what you did that winter Ekta Kapoor !","Agatha Christie's classic work - 'And Then There Were None' provided the idea of a story containing multiple murders at some secluded place, totally cut off from the rest of the world and in which the murderer is likely to be hidden in the group of victims itself. Several novels and movies (in various languages) have come up during the past three quarter of a century by seeking inspiration from this immortal novel of the mystery queen which was first published in 1939. Kucch To Hai is one of them.However the inspiration from And Then There Were None is for the post-interval session of the movie. The pre-interval session is based on a Hollywood movie - I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997). Thus Kucch To Hai is a cocktail of I Know What You Did Last Summer and And Then There Were None. Kucch To Hai (something is there for sure) starts in Shimla with the college life of the principal characters of the story who consist of Karan (Tusshar), Taanya (Esha Deol), Taashu (Nataasha), Yash (Yash Tonk) and many of their other friends. There is a professor in the college who appears to be somewhat psychic and therefore, scary to the students. This strange professor is - Professor Bakshi (Rishi Kapoor). The college life is studded with the pranks, teases and romances of the young male-female students. One day a college-mate of these youngsters is found hanged from the roof and everybody thinks that he has committed suicide due to the pressure of studies and exams. But the reality is something else.There is a love triangle here involving three principal characters of the movie - Karan, Taanya and Taashu whose name is actually Nataasha but she is fondly called Taashu. Karan and Taanya are in love but Taashu also loves Karan. Taashu is an orphan who has been fostered by Karan's father (Jeetendra) only. Yash (who appears to be a flirt) tries to impress Taashu from his side but fails. Now comes the principal twist in the tale.Professor Bakshi snatches Taanya's answer-book during an examination and now she is under threat to lose one year of education. Karan alongwith Yash and others sneaks into Professor Bakshi's house at night in order to change Taanya's answer-book. To their horror, they find a dead body in the house which is supposed to be that of Professor Bakshi's wife. While running away from there, they happen to accidentally kill Professor Bakshi. Under the mental stress of whatever has happened, Taanya leaves the college and the city and very shortly, the group of friends gets dispersed with different ones going in different directions.Three years later, two of this group - Khush (Akshay Chitre) and Dolly (Kusumit Sana) decide to get married to each other and the ceremony is kept at Shimla only in a hotel. Quite naturally, the complete group of friends re-assemble for the occasion. Meantime, Karan has got engaged to Taashu and their marriage is also to take place shortly. On the railway station, a member of this group - Pat (Vrajesh Hirjee) feels that he has seen Professor Bakshi there. Firstly, the other friends don't trust him but when chilling incidents start taking place with many members, Pat gets killed when trying to flee away from that place, Yash endures a lethal attack on him and the newly wedded couple of Dolly and Khush gets murdered, they have to trust that Professor Bakshi is not dead and he is there to seek revenge from them all. Whether this is truth, half-truth or completely an illusion becomes clear in the climax.Ekta Kapoor is said to furnish basic story ideas to the script-writers of her movies and TV serials and it might have been her idea to blend I Know What You Did Last Summer with And Then There Were None but perhaps she could not allow a free hand to the writers and the directors. Director Anuraag Basu (renamed as Anuraag Bose) who later directed movies like Murder (2004) and Gangster (2006), was kicked out when the making of this movie was midway and the remaining part was directed by Anil Vishwakarma Kumar. Perhaps due to the presentation of the visions of two different directors, this movie does not contain a definite mood throughout its duration and shifts from a rom-com to a love-triangle to a horror movie to a murder mystery. The first half of the movie is damn interesting and other than the main twist in the story (which has been lifted from I Know What You Did Last Summer), the frolic, pranks, teases and romance of the college-mates amuse the audience very much. This part has a youth appeal and must have been liked by the college-goers (though the movie was a flop). Mainly it's the second half which is a letdown. Ekta Kapoor could not understand that a suspense-thriller could not be a hit just by hiding the identity of the killer behind a mask. Performances are average. If I have to choose the best performer, it's Yash Tonk. Other than Ekta's younger brother Tusshar, her father Jeetendra, Esha Deol and Johnny Lever, the cast consists of the actors working in various TV serials made by Ekta Kapoor. The second lead of the movie has been given the filmy name of Nataasha but her real name is Anita Hassnandaani. This is the last movie of Jeetendra. Sadly most of the performers could not deliver their best. That's the weakness of the direction.Well, we know what you did that winter (January 2003) Ekta Kapoor. You spoiled a brilliant story idea through your undue interference in the creative department of the movie." 
" Good suspenseful movie","A good movie to watch. This movie is a edge of the seat thriller. Although its climax is almost as same as of the movie Gupt and also it is a complete copy of I know what you did last summer and I still know what you did last summer. This movie is really fun to watch. Watch it for some real time pass. My rating- 9/10" 
" Not happening","First of all let me make it very clear that I did not watch the Hollywood film from which it was copied,so for me Kucch To Hai was a fresh film. Alas, I was very disappointed after watching it. The problem here is that this film fails to clarify to which genre it belongs.Whenever a suspense is created, romance track with songs interrupted. This happens throughout this film. Even the climax was diluted with a bit of drama.On the whole the plot tells the story of few friends who faced problem when they ran over their professor who himself killed his wife and hiden it in his home. These gang of friends came to know this before this accident in order to stole the answer sheet for their friend. They thought he died and they separated. Years later they reunite at their friends wedding unknown to fact that professor is alive and seeking revenge.Acting was passable, direction of Anurag Basu and Anil V. Kumar duo was poor. Lack of focus to what they want to make made the film silly." 
" great horror movie..","hay guys, i saw that movie , hay, storyline is same. it is a typical Indian masaala movie. but the sound system that has been used  is ultimate. see that movie on DvD.its story is similar to movie i know what u did last summer and screem and some Indian movie.it also match with Indian movie 'gupt'" 
" I know what you did last summer part 1 & 2 goes to Bollywood!","You have to give the director and writers props though. They didn't just copy the American counterpart of this film, they took both the original and the sequel, added a few dance numbers to it + a dose of some Scream 2 and covered it all in under 2 and a half hours. Esha Deol and Tusshar Kapoor sizzle again as young teenagers in college who are naturally attracted to each other. Their romance blooms juxtaposed against the back-story of suspense, thriller and eventual horror when a former ex-communicated psychotic professor returns to campus and students start to go missing one by one. But is this psycho professor really to blame for all the supernatural occurrences on campus? A wild night out after a last night as co-eds lands the teenagers and their friends in trouble as murder suspects when they accidental hit a pedestrian while driving home in the rain. After graduation, Esha's character break up with Tusshar's character and Esha moves to England. The guilt of their secret killing haunts them all and virtually tears up their friendships. While in England, Esha is haunted by memories of the killing that she decides to return to India to clear her head. Upon arriving in town, she finds out that two of her old friends are getting married as so she heads out to the engagement party, only to find out Tusshar is now engaged to his childhood sweetheart, who was also a friend of Esha's back in school. While the wedding now serves as a backdrop for a mini reunion, the body count starts to mount again when the teenagers go up to a mountain top resort continuing their celebration and are trapped there during a blackout. Who is killing all these people? And is this person responsible for all those deaths back in their college days as well? To find out, make sure you check out Kucch to Hai! Oh! and I must mention that the music is awesome as are the dance numbers and wedding costumes."
