" Screaming queens","Fever pitch melodrama about a group of hijra (male to female transsexuals) living in a glamorised community in Rajasthan. It appears to be a message picture about the plight of this misunderstood minority, and some of the extras are genuine hijra. But the whole thing is so over the top it's impossible to take seriously. As star hijra Mukta, Vineeth behaves like Lillian Gish on speed. His anguished stagger through the wilderness, beating his chest and falling into heaps, had the audience at London's Indian Film Festival almost in hysterics. The music underscores every emotion with absurd over-emphasis. A pity because direction and photography have flair."
