" A below average movie","Politics has been a hot topic for movies in India. The newbie director just had to make a little more effort to create a movie which could relate better to the scenario and not make things just fly in the air. The plot couldn't get justice from Jacky Bhagnani who like his character 'Abhimanyu' has got an easy access to film industry because of his dad. The story and screenplay are good. The writers have given the youngster the name Abhimanyu in the very right context. His father is called Dashrath, I wonder if they wanted to convey something on 'Ram rajya'. Farooq Sheikh no doubt fulfills the missing charisma. It turned out to be his last film sadly. Neha Sharma is cute and her chemistry with Jacky is superb. Jacky has to work hard on his acting skills. He didn't have the body language of that 'stern' leader. No politician in this country would be that 'frank' to lose his votes. The music is good. Sangamarmar is the best song. The film ends with Abhimanyu kaul winning elections on his own but how he executes the plans is not explained. Winning elections is no big thing in India, but after winning how things get implemented is the thing what films should cover in my opinion. A below average effort which certainly could have been better with a better director and dialogues" 
" A Well-Made, Honest Film..","'Youngistaan' may not be flawless or a razor-sharp political satire, but its A Well-Made, Honest Film. Its potential cannot be denied, despite its visible minuses!'Youngistaan' Synopsis: Abhimanyu Kaul - a young, independent, Games Developer, living in Japan & the love of his life, Anwita Chauhan - a bubbly, passionate & full of life, summer intern. Their happy and content life faces the test of time, when blood ties & the pressure of being born into the first family of India tears a young Abhimanyu between his love for Anwita & a promise made to his dying father, the Prime Minister of India. Being a public figure, by reluctantly accepting to represent the governing party, much against his own wishes & at the cost of his private life, is a double-edged sword that Abhimanyu must walk on.'Youngistaan' explores an underdog's story with honesty. It begins well, it progresses well, as the humor works, the political portions work & so do the performances. But, the second-hour begins to lose pace. Once our protagonist, turns into the most powerful man of the country, his journey grips you completely. But, the subplot, the romantic-angle, acts as a deterrent, more-so in the second-hour. Its stagnates the pace as well as the overall impact. Another thing, the length could've been trimmed, by at least 15-minutes. Syed Ahmad Afzal's Screenplay does justice to an interesting premise, but could've been sharper. His Direction, on the other-hand, is controlled. Cinematography & Editing are good.Performance-Wise: Jackky Bhagnani enacts the protagonist, with sincerity. He's controlled, mature & believable all through. This has to be his best work till date. Neha Sharma does an okay job. The Late/Great Farooq Sheikh is a joy to watch, as always. Boman Irani is wasted.On the whole, 'Youngistaan' is a good watch." 
" India really needs such young and dynamic leaders","Vasu Bhagnaani's production Youngistaan starring his son Jacky Bhagnaani in lead role was released on 28.03.2014 telling the story of a 28 years old youth becoming the prime minister of India. Less than two months later, the rulers of India changed and we got a new prime minister who is not 28 years old but 64 years old. However the Indian masses have voted him to power with an absolute majority with a lot of expectation. Let's see what he is able to do during his tenure. However the story of Youngistaan is somewhat similar not to that of the current prime minister of India but to that of Late Rajiv Gandhi who had accidentally become the Indian premier at the relatively young age of 40 years on 31.10.1984 after the brutal murder of his mother and the then prime minister of India - Mrs. Indira Gandhi. I watched Youngistaan quite late (after the general elections and the change of rule at the centre) but this movie impressed me so much that I decided to write its review.Abhimanyu Kaul (Jacky Bhagnaani) is the son of the prime minister of India - Mr. Dashrath Kaul (Boman Irani) but having no interest in politics, has always stayed away from it and is pursuing his career as a computer game developer in Japan when he has to rush to India due to his father's being on his death-bed. In order to fulfill the last wish of his father, he has to enter Indian politics quite reluctantly and wear the thorny crown of Indian premiership. His girlfriend Anwita (Neha Sharma) who never wanted him to join politics, is quite unhappy at it but she has to yield before his decision. How Abhimanyu is able to don this role and checkmate his opponents with his deceased father's secretary Akbar Uncle (Farooq Sheikh) being the only trustworthy person for him in this cobweb, forms the remaining part of the movie.After watching I am surprised that most of the professional reviewers have trashed this movie like anything as if it's a very bad product. This is one more illustration of the various biases maintained and nurtured by the Indian film reviewers. Youngistaan may not be a great movie but it's by all means a good, well-made and admirable movie. The movie clearly conveys what it purports to convey without any confusion, ambiguity or digression. The heart of the movie is in the right place and despite being an imaginary and improbable story, the things happening in the corridors of Indian politics have been depicted with a highly realistic approach. In my humble opinion, Youngistaan is a completely no-nonsense movie and the efforts of the team behind its making deserve to be appreciated.Due to the realistic approach only, the movie appears to be monotonous and boring at places. The climax is, therefore, dull and unappealing. However the filmmaker has shown better sense by not inserting too many regular Bollywood formulae and undue melodrama in the narrative and kept the things shown on the screen as straightforward and reliable as possible. Entertainment does not appear to be the motive of the filmmaker though such movies are usually made for entertaining the audience and thereby hauling box office collections. Hence this paradoxical approach of the filmmaker is strange but laudable.The whole milieu of the movie mainly that linked to the corridors of power in India, appears to be out and out real. The body language of the different characters is quite apt according to the assigned roles and the mood of the movie. Sets are impressive. Ditto for cinematography. Dialogs are not theatrical but quite appropriate according to different situations and the characters uttering them. Background score is in order.Music director Jeet Ganguly hasn't composed any super hit numbers for this movie but his musical score alongwith the lyrics of Arijit Singh is certainly good.I have been an admirer of Jacky Bhagnaani since his debut movie Kal Kissne Dekha (2009). He is a handsome as well as talented actor who deserves the right break to give a boost to his career. He has rendered a controlled performance in the lead role of Abhimanyu whose years are tender but personality is mature. Another highly admirable performance has come from Late Farooque Sheikh in the role of the PM's secretary. All others have also fitted the bill.The word Youngistaan represents the youthful part of the Indian population who is open-minded, progress-oriented, free from bigotry and does not believe in any undesirable discrimination among people. This Youngistaan badly needs a youthful, dynamic and open-minded leader at the helm of affairs. The hero of Youngistaan is an imaginary character but we, the right-thinking Indians, wish that it were real." 
" Great Story Line","The movie starts of slow, but the attitude and the slow build of the story line keeps you gripping, the actors have played a great role in gripping the movie. The director's vision is great waiting for the sequel(hope doesn't get boxed because of low box office response).The story line is not new, it is something we already have come across in many movies the change, but the manner of portrayal sure is different. I would watch it again I really don't mind, the background music beats grip you.We see a movie just for time pass but try to see them based on what we can take out of these movies. The life lessons like the ones in the movie are small and practical and they hit the nail on the head and should be easy to identify.The above is my personal opinion." 
" A watchable movie - If you have a couple of hours to kill","Just finished watching this movie and found it a little different from the typical Bollywood fare. It has love & politics and relationships but no action sequences to determine which is better - love or politics. I imagine this would reverberate at least a little with the audience at the metro cities in India.The movie is about the son of the PM who takes over as the PM upon the death of his father. And yes - one can see similarities between the actions of some real-life characters in the Indian political system (both past & present).It seemed like the director had a lot of good ideas and wanted to try out all of them in the movie which leads to a pretty disjointed feeling as you go through the movie. Should the focus be on the political maneuvering skills, managing the "uniqueness" of his personal life or trying to charm "young India" with technology? The director has tried to address every possible scenario in the life of a PM which seemed a bit of an overkill. Considering the target audience, it would've been wiser to pick a main plot and build a few sub-plots around it but instead, this turned out to be a serious of parallel stories just moving along.In addition, there are few good characters/actors who seemed wasted with just a few random scenes here & there - one of being Boman Irani Jr. I haven't seen him in any movie after Student of the Year and it was good to see him on screen again but sadly not enough meat in his role.Jacky Bhagnani has done a fairly decent role as the young PM. But his lack of expressions makes the movie a little dull & dragging. Neha Sharma is there to act pretty and nothing more. Farooq Sheikh was of course the best of the lot. This was perhaps amongst his last few movies along with "Yeh Jawani.." Overall, watchable once for the slightly different theme it carries. I didn't watch it in a theater and so it wasn't a couple of waste of time. I watched it at home when I was doing other stuff and hence didn't really feel like I wasted my time!" 
" a light hearted political insight.....",""Youngistaan," stands for a country driven by a young prime-minister who is really a novice in politics. In a way, the film hints into Rahul Gandhi who recently fought for a political election in India. Subject wise the film is pretty good and shows a glimpse of Indian politics and gives you a chance to delve into different shades of politics. But the focus isn't very deep and wraps the issues superficially making the film pretty forgettable. Besides, the film lacks the rawness or other commercial angles that would pull crowds. Though the hero makes a good performance, the things could have been different if Ranbir Kapoor had played the role. Anyway, for me, the film was OK till it lasted but not remarkable.Rating: 2 stars out of 4" 
" one time watch, nothing new to offer","An average film which is passable for a one time watch but will not leave a lasting impression. There are no twists and turns in the movie as far as the storyline is concerned.It is a reflection of the contemporary scenario in Indian politics with all its flaws of petty partisanship, corruption, dynasty politics, self centered leaders which are out of sync with the aspirations of the common man and the helplessness of a single person trying to be the change. It is about a young man who is overnight passed on the responsibility of leading the largest democracy in the world.The movie depicts the change in the nature of attitude of the protagonist form being a reluctant leader to one who is aware of his roots and the greatness of his nation. As the movie progresses he realizes the real problems hindering the progress of the nation and tries to change things for the better.At the same time he has to manage his personal life and the movie also shows the change in outlook of friends, girlfriend and family regarding the responsibility entrusted to the hero.The movie has various subtle messages like living life on your own terms, being righteous, expected role of leaders, the importance of ideals in politics, the capability of the youth to change the society, the reasons to participate in democratic process, and so on.At the same time it draws parallel to Indian leaders and I felt that the Pranab interview scene a taking it a bit too far. It was as if the movie wanted to redeem someone.All and all, as I earlier stated it can be a one time watch. Maybe with a higher level of acting by the main characters or something new in the storyline could have improved the film" 
" Could be much better","When I heard the name Youngistan I felt the film maybe something regarding today's politics, of course the pre-conceived notions were there as it stars Jackky Bhagnani. The film had lot of potential but the makers confused the film as a romantic comedy for the most part. The film starts off in Japan where are would be PM is enjoying his live in relationship and also he is a game developer something which is given too much focus at start. After painting the town red in Japan they set to India where PM Dashrat Singh(Boman Irani) is dieing and then Jackky is made a PM, the film focuses more on the romance between Jackky and Neha. The political twists are well handled at times but overall the film seems a confusion.Direction is okay Music is quite good, Suno Na is the best songJackky Bhagnani does do a good job and shows a good improvement Neha Sharma is so-so Late Farooque Sheikh is flawless in his role, Mita Vashisht is wasted Kayoze Irani and Boman Irani(father and son in real life) are given small roles, Prakash Belawadi is superb so are the rest" 
" Unbelievably Ridiculous","If I hadn't already labeled one of the films that I watched as the worst one ever, this one might have easily taken the spot. To start off, this film is about the romantic life of the PM of the country, and has a singular agenda - to awaken people to the fact that having a live in relationship is the choice of two individuals and nobody else's business. What a deeply coherent and nuanced plot! So we have a very brooding protagonist whose expression seldom changes in the film, except when he attempts to portray joy and ends up reminding us of the last sickly person we've met. He is apparently a superbrain (he wears glasses, duh!) So, this guy arbitrarily gets chosen as the leader of the nation, despite having no relation with politics, which begs the question of his credentials (his girlfriend discusses the same!) The girlfriend is a typical character out of contemporary Bollywood - aggressive, demanding and basically, immature. Still, she's more likable than the hero and acts much better too.So the PM goes around in supposed catwalks (he's too dead to even do that well), making youthful gestures and appealing to his 'youngistaan'. His lack of trust in the 'oldistaan' is never touched upon. The hero is a shrewd one, having a definite vote bank in mind, one that constitutes the majority and will be impressed by his interest in sports, his software career background, his live in relationship, his electronic voting system and his PDA. But let's not forget that he is the Bollywood guy who never does things for selfish reasons. So, true to his role, he makes a farce of leaving the dirty political game while secretly planning to enter the system from behind. He also does his song and dance routine while giving bhashans on unity and prosperity out of the blue while mainly focusing on the demarcation between person and professional living.The hero then flings his invisible magic wand and in a matter of seconds (the rest of the film is about 'live in relationships'), solves issues of youth finances, farmer suicides, collision politics and not to forget, people's opinions about personal and professional lives of other people. Basically, one good person = one good nation.This film is inappropriately titled youngistaan. It barely refers to the youth of the nation, and is neither based on a popular soft drink, but more to the choice of living in versus marriage for the young. I've never despised the living in concept, but now that it's been associated with this film, well! In sum, the film is too superficial to be either meaningful or funny. It tries hard to take a comic take on the everyday life of a most prominent personality. It flops miserably, because it is not daring enough to explore, to get away from the typical heroic image in bollywood. Besides, the less said about the performances, the better. What a waste!" 
" Totally Boring","I have looked at several movies based on Indian politics (Raajneeti being the best) This is by far the most boring. It was an interesting premise: about a young man who is thrust into Indian politics and becomes the leader of one of the world's largest democracies. However, I believe that shoddy direction resulted in an uninspiring movie. The acting left a lot to be desired.Jacky's attempt to pull of the role of a serious politician fell flat, and I am yet to figure out what Neha's role in this movie was. Farooq Shaik's role wasn't bad, but it was brief.The music was totally lacklustre, the only "good" song being Suno Na. All other songs came across as noise. Final Rating 3/10" 
" Youngistaan Review","Looking at the trailers one would get would expect Youngistaan to fall in a very utopic zone. Well it does in most of the places, but presents a new side of a story which you might like or discard it as unimportant in such a plot.Abhimanyu (Jackky Bhagnani) is the only son and heir of the Prime Minister (Boman Irani) of India. Abhimanyu lives a simple life working as a passionate gaming developer at a gaming company in Japan. His world is his job and his live-in girlfriend Anvita (Neha Sharma). When the father dies of cancer, he is replaced as the new Prime Minister to lead the nation for the next three months until the general elections. Abhimanyu is lost initially in this new world, totally clueless facing vital responsibilities. Apart from this, he has to face the testing times in his personal life which is affected due to the endless protocols that are mandatory for P.M. The gradual transformation of this leader from being clueless to a clever politician keeping the good intentions intact is the theme all about.Youngistaan invests a considerable time on the side effects of politics on his protagonist's personal life. It's a boon and a bane at the same time. Those who expect more content on the scheming politics would be disappointed. And at the same time, it seems like a conscious decision to be hatke. However, the last 30 minutes seems too stretched with extremely predictable plot. The tackling of the senior leaders doesn't excite making the culmination wearisome. The humor is well-written though, especially in the first half, most of which is situational.Jackky has improved a lot from the FALTU days and gives a passable performance as the 28-yr old Prime Minister. Neha Sharma scores brownie points and justifying her role trying to fit in the new world. Farooq Sheikh plays the role of the loyal P.A . The legendary actor's subtle reactions are a pleasure to the eyes. Madras Café fame Prakash Belwadi also has an important role in the film.The soundtrack of the film is impressive with soulful tunes. Cinematography and editing are neat too. The convenient writing in some of the sequences is what goes against the movie, but at the same time the director's skill in keeping the viewer should be appreciated when an escapist script is on the plate.The movie can be given a try. Catch in on the television telecast later, if not in the cinema halls." 
" Enjoyable but forgettable","This film tells the story of a young man who lives a life of indulgence in Tokyo. He suddenly becomes the prime minister of India, and he did evening he can to change the nation for the better, while navigating the treacherous world of politics.I was waiting for the typical (or stereotypical) Bollywood scene where all the characters suddenly burst into a frenzy of music and dance. I was disappointed because the film stays a drama all along, and there was no Bollywood dance scene. The plot is alright, portraying the young prime minister to be an unlikely hero. Even though the film is a drama, the film maintains a light hearted atmosphere. It's enjoyable, but probably also forgettable." 
" A Rare Bollywood Political Drama that Actually Ticks A Fair Amount Right Boxes","Reviewed by: Dare Devil KidRating: 3.4/5 starsA wonderful ideology, well-executed within the best of its limitations. "Youngistaan" addresses some pressing and extremely relevant topics, and while the film doesn't always succeed in presenting a lucid theory towards these problems plaguing the nation, it does manage to stir emotions and inspire viewers to a degree by serving a pertinent canvas of political issues.Director, Syed Ahmed Afzal, weaves a decent narrative around an inspirational plot, and even though his handling of this complex subject is a tad underwhelming at times, at the end of the day he does manage to get the tone and feel of the film right. Superior scripting and crisper plot transitions could have helped the film convey its message more assuredly, nevertheless, given a chance "Youngistaan" does grow on you over the course of its approximately 2-hour duration.Punching way above its weight, "Youngistaan" is pleasantly entertaining and thought-provoking. More importantly, it gives Farooq Shaikh a memorable swansong in a well-written role." 
" Youngistaan Movie Review","Youngistaan Movie Review : The idea of Youngistaan might have germinated from the 'dance of democracy' brouhaha that our nation is currently witnessing with the vibrant political scenario. And with the Parliamentary elections looming large, the release of this film finds a suitably perfect time. But well- intentioned ideas do not necessarily translate into successful product. Debutant director Syed Ahmad Afzalmight have set his eyes on this ambitious yet sensitive subject like politics but somehow doesn't succeed in bringing out the interesting mix of drama, action, power and cynicism. The story which kicks off in Tokyo with an impressive background score(Salim Sulaiman) where Abhinav Kaul(Jackkie Vagnani)is working hard as a gamer and partying hard with his live-in girlfriend,Anvita(Neha Sharma) and pal( Kayoze Irani),takes a sudden U- turn to India's capital with the death of his father, Dasrath Kaul(Boman Irani, cameo) who happens to the country's PM. Overnight, his life is changed when he is entrusted with the responsibility of the country's most coveted seat of the acting PM."With great power comes greater responsibility " – Abhi soon faces hostility from members within his party, delves deeper to unravel a scam.His bewilderment in the dirty game is no lesser than her girlfriend's continuing dismay who doesn't get any private time with him.At this juncture , his only confidante is the endearing PA to his late father ,Akbar uncle(Late Farooq Sheikh Saab) who silently encourages him at every step. Afzal seems to model his protagonist on the Congress VP, Rahul Gandhi where his stubbled looks, wardrobes and demeanor find a striking similarity but the plot focuses more on his personal life and the upheavals caused due to the media, with some purely avoidable inserts of comic elements. The narrative doesn't gather the necessary momentum and with a sloppy execution ,it touches the core issues only at the periphery. Some of the potential ideas which the film introduces like the youth reforms, e-voting are not pushed further and eventually they fall flat.Resultantly ,it doesn't offer much scope for Jackkie Vagnani who tries to pull-off with a committed performance but gets absorbed in the uninspiring scheme of affairs.Neha Sharma is sporty but falters in the emotional parts. It's a wise assortment of talented supporting casts like Mita Vasisth, Prakash Belawadi(of Madras Café fame) and Farooq Sheikh but none of their characters are sketched in an illustrious way. Overall, Youngistaan starts off well, makes tall claims and much like our nation's leaders,fails to deliver." 
" Youngistaan is not the 'Voice of Change', but definitely an initiation towards the same.","The Plot: Youngistaan is a romantic movie set up in the backdrop of political scenario. It is a very light movie and indeed different from the usual ones. No melodrama neither when the romance is handled nor when politics is handled.Abhimanyu Kaul (Jackky Bhagnani) is happily settled in Japan Professionally (in a high flying job) and also personally (in a live-in relationship with Anwita Chauhan essayed by Neha Sharma). Everything is going great and that is when he learns about his father Dashrath Kaul's (Boman Irani) ill-health who is the Prime minister of India. On father's demise, Abhimanyu is propelled into the nation's highest political seat i.e. of Prime Minister. Dashrath Kaul before dying leaves him in the trusted care of his PA and Adviser, Akbar (Farooque Sheikh).The movie is the journey of a young man who has strayed into politics as the acting Prime Minister until the next election, which is six months away. He tries to handle the not so popular ruling party (of his father), the Akhil Bharatiya Kranti Party (ABKP) and its seasoned party members, at times tactfully, and at times in a shrewd manner. He does take efforts to balance his professional and personal life.The flip side of the movie is that it neither showcases hardcore politics nor romance. We have a young Prime Minister who is unconventional in his thoughts, who feels, it is absolutely alright not to follow typical neta type dress-code or even to have a live-in girl friend carrying his child.But I feel that, Lok Sabha election being around the corner, the timing was absolutely perfect to launch Youngistaan. But somewhere the effort has fizzled since no current issues are highlighted, no specific change is suggested and no specific message is mentioned. Official Trailer:Direction, Story, Dialogue and Screenplay: The Director, Syed Ahmad Afzal, has taken a different approach to project this film on political drama cum romance. He has tried to convey the message very very lightly without emphasizing on serious things. Probably he did not want to make a hard core political or romantic movie.Story, Dialogue and Screenplay by Syed Ahmad Afzal, Ramiz Ilham Khan, Maitrey Bajpai are simple without much of melodrama. Even the speech at UN assembly by Abhimayu is written at a very ground level.Personally, I liked one dialogue of Abhimayu: When the person whom you love is angry with you, don't question him/ her, just go and hug him / her. That person simply needs you.Cast and their Performance: Jackky Bhagnani as Abhimanyu Kaul comes across a very lovable personality who is very presentable on screen. He is cool, composed even in midst of uncertainties, romours, oppositions, criticisms. His temperance is appreciable.Neha Sharma as Anwita Chauhan doesn't have much role apart from playing a girl-friend of acting Prime-minister, who suddenly finds herself in house arrest due to security issues. One can not deny that she has done justice to her role who is possessive, freedom loving, and at times immature and overbearing.Boman Irani as Dashrath Kaul , father of Abhimanyu, has a guest appearance only, but his presence is felt throughout the movie.Kayoze Irani as Zafar, Abhimayu's friend and Mita Vashishth, Abhimanyu' office personnel are good.But I want to make a special mention of Akbar, Abhimanyu's PA and Adviser, essayed by Farooq Sheikh. I adored every frame in which he was there. Loved his expressions and the way he dealt with Abhimanyu and his relationship with Anwita. Super cool. I am going to miss him on screen since this was his last movie.Music: Music is OK. Arijit crooning Suno na Sangemarmar (music by Jeet Ganguli and lyrics by Kausar Munir) is very good, and it is ranking high in the chartbusters. Youngistaan anthem (sung by Shree D, Ishq Bector) is good with its meaningful lyrics.Moments to watch out for: Farooq Sheikh on screen (unfortunately for the last time). Implementation of e-voting. Youngsters shouldering the responsibility to choose the leaders.Thumbs up: The very thought behind making the movie : Be the change, if you want change. A very light movie without political bloodshed.Thumbs down: The film fails to focus on either of the theme – Romance and Politics. Script and the idea is good, but less clarity as far as the screenplay is concerned. Abhimanyu's victory is not justified : what exactly he achieved during his tenure as Acting Prime Minister, which prompted the country to choose him ? His personal life and its issues were more in focus rather than the Election & winning strategies, Country's issues etc. The story does not develop at all till interval." 
" A purposeful film portraying real life Indian Politics but the question is that who actually made this, releasing with such a perfect timing?","Though politics can easily be quoted as one of the most favorite subjects of general discussion in the public, still for a film adaptation it has always been a dicey one with only few exceptions in the past. So at one end, YOUNGISTAAN can surely be rated as a brave film, trying to en-cash the current political mood of the whole country with a positive message. But on the other, the way it has been presented before the audience with a specific purpose & perfect timing, it more seems to be the part of publicity campaign of one of the leading parties of the nation, rather than being a new Hindi Film in totality.Directed by Syed Ahmad Afzal, it begins too casually with a party song straight away and then starts imitating the real life political scenario of India, focusing completely on the young character of Jacky Bhagnani as the next Prime Minister of the country and nothing else. The boy reaches the reputed post all of a sudden just because of a favourable stroke of destiny and one can easily raise many questions on the sequences depicting his unexpected entry in politics executed so casually. However following a very light, comic progression, the film does manage to hook you up initially due to its novel concept and few enjoyable scenes. But once the script completely goes into politics; everything starts happening too quickly and in quite a childish way too, forgetting that we are actually talking about A President, PM and other prominent figures running our country and not any high profile owners of a big corporate firm doing the routine business.So in real terms, YOUNGISTAAN fails to make an impact as it gets confused between various genres and is not able to follow any particular one throughout. In the first few reels, it is a comedy, in the middle ones it turns into a half heartedly made political thriller and then in the last few it becomes a boring social drama with a message given in a prolonged climax. As a result it can simply be rated as a film with an important & heavy subject, made in an equally light, careless or immature way without having any clear path.To name the plus points, its production design is eye-catching, background score is decent and the soundtrack has got a good song too as 'Suno Na Sangemarmar'. Moroever Jacky once again gives an impressive performance with all his calm charm and Neha Sharma does fine too looking beautiful on the screen. The rest of the cast including Boman Irani, Meeta Vashisht and Kayoze Irani get nothing much to do, except late Farooque Sheikh, who is an absolutely delight to watch and remains the only saving grace in the film right till the end.In short, it's the post interval section of the film which makes it quite boring to watch as we have already seen enough of that stuff on our TV sets since the last few months. Coming to its realistic references, such are the straight similarities of the film with the contemporary Indian Politics and its ruling party that at times one starts thinking that perhaps this has been made by the party only in order to spread a positive wave about their candidates in the next election. For instance, it has a scene wherein Jackie is probably inaugurating a very high rise statue of a key figure (pointing towards Sardar Patel) and then we have a TV interview of him taken by a renowned journalist named Parnab too (reminding you of Arnab of Times Now Channel). Further the film releasing in a very crucial week just before the elections surely puts you in doubts about the real motive of its making and the actual producers.Anyway whatever the truth behind its production might be, the basic point is that the film actually suffers a lot due to the completely confused vision of its director, following which he tries to put in almost everything to woo the audience ranging from a video game developer's job, live in relationship, having a child before the marriage and a lead character named Dashrath wearing a purely Muslim attire (to please both the communities). Moreover YOUNGISTAAN can also be called an entirely filmy take or a questionable fantasy version of the current political situation of our country, wherein there is no strong opposition in the picture and also ready made solutions are available with the Prime Minister for every major problem as if he is still playing a video game knowing all its codes."
