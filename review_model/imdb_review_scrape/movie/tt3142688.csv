" Refreshingly Good, Simple, and Feel Good Comedy, with its own share of ignorable flaws","FINDING FANNY (English): 7.5/10Finding Fanny revolves around five rather dysfunctional characters on a road trip to find "Fanny"- the love of the life of one of them. As the amusing plot unfolds, the characters are shown in vibrant shades and a rather refreshing climax wraps it up in a very nice way. All in all, a good movie worth watching at least once. A brave attempt to recreate the magic of the old time comedies lost after Hrishikesh Mukherjee and his school of film making. Its a feel good comic-drama backed by some decent performances. The actors brought alive the characters, which, must I say, were rather well built. While Pankaj Kapoor was the best in the lot and Naseeruddin Shah was just about as outstanding as ever, it was Dimple Kapadia, who did that bit of extra-effort to fit into the canvas with an air of grace. I have had my reservation on the selection of Arjun Kapoor, who seemed to be edgy at times; all credit must go to the director who was able to judiciously moderate the character to hide Arjun's monotonous limitations rather colourfully within the frame. Deepika Padukone for a change performed surprisingly well, and dare I say beyond expectations. Worth mentioning: she looked stunning in her rather simple get-up for the film. However, making her the primary narrator, well, was apt, but not judicious. An out and out off-beat feel good movie, without much of melodrama, grandeur and unnecessary colours, Finding Fanny is a tale right out of a book of great Indian short stories and stands as a one off instance of a movie that has been narrated and directed well from behind the camera. The script was seamlessly flowing, and the story was well woven, the camera man, requires a word of praise for making Indian locations look as beautiful and appealing. To sum it up, its rare to find that feel good brew, which has been ever so elusive from Hindi films for some time now.The dead cat didn't smell for a real long time, almost through out the trip, apart from that continuity was well managed." 
" Delicious, quirky characters add fizz to this funny film","Naseeruddin Shah : is a shy, solemn loner, the post master in a village where no one posts or receives any mail, still is a choirboy singer even though his days of being a boy are well behind him. And he brays, nay, sobs inconsolably as he receives a marriage proposal he'd made to his beloved Fanny via mail, forty-six years ago. It was never posted ! And the only one who understands him, is willing to help him is the girl he considers to be like a daughter, who he thinks will make one lucky bugger a great wife and will also be a super motherDeepika Deepika Padukone : ethereal, leggy, flashing that dimpled smile of hers, a vision in floral dresses, floating through their tiny Goan village, remains upbeat despite all that's happened to her, with her husband choking to death on her wedding day, she till today isn't sure whether she should've accepted her hubby's proposal or gone with his friend instead, her quiet admirer, the quiet, quite infatuated Arjun.Arjun Kapoor : left town the day Deepika was going to get married. Rumour has it he went to Mumbai and was successful in some business. Is now back in their village. Not happy about how things have turned out. Prone to angry outbursts. Alone in his dilapidated house, which is falling apart. And working on his old car, which is also falling apart. Which he's just sold to Pankaj.Pankaj Kapur : is the new man in town, an award winning artist, a painter who earns huge sums for his every brush stroke. Is enjoying his solitude, the idyllic sylvan surroundings, his alcohol. And is also indulging in his fetish for 'big' womenby ogling at DimpleDimple Kapadia : who does have a really large ass ! Also happens to be Deepika's mother in law and house mate, the woman who makes the tiny village tick, the one who organizes everything and loves being the centre of attentionthe type who will try to commit suicide but will cough first to make sure someone is watchingthe stingy type who will hide the cookies if she thinks her guest is eating too manythe type who feels too many drinks don't agree with her legs. Gout? Inquires Pankaj, solicitously ? No, she laughs, it makes them spread openThese five quirky characters set off on a drive to locate Naseer's precious Fanny. In the dilapidated car. From the village that we're assured is so tiny, you cant locate it on a map. And interesting things happen on the way.This is one of those delicious movies where its not so much about the story but more about the characters and the conversations. Where the script and the dialogue is, quite refreshingly, actually king. Where the music sets the mood but doesn't overpower. Where the performances by the stalwarts, Pankaj, Naseer are every bit what you would expect – they get into the skin of their assigned roles, changing body language, their walk, their way of talking to ensure we believe in them. Pankaj, in particular, has more scope to display his intensity, especially in a little bit towards the end. Dimple is very good too, dominating yet hesitantly finding her way through the challenges life has thrown at her. Arjun has probably the most unidimensional role and he does it credit. In acting chops, probably the one who has to go the furthest, but he can still hold his head high after this one. And Deepikaah, sweet, lovely, Deepika! Anyone who doubts whether she can actI mean, really actbetter be advised to watch this one. None of the histrionics, over the top gestures and mannerisms of say, Chennai Expressjust subtle changes of expressions, a slightly quizzical mien of inner happiness with just a smidgen of indecision. This is one of those films which is about journeys, self-discovery, life and more. The lessons made easy with the humour and the idiosyncratic dramatis personae. Set in a place where we all wish we could besimpler, where time seems to stand still. And its not so much about Finding Fanny, but finding loveat any ageMore reviews at ApurvBollywood" 
" To start with I am impressed","To start with I am impressed with the fact the director who made a commercial masala film like Cocktail actually made this film. Finding Fanny is not a regular Bollywood film, it's for a very niche audience. Most filmmakers say that their films are different but take my word for it because this one is actually different.The story revolves around five characters and is set in a village called Pocolim in Goa where life is slow and simple. Their needs are minimal and they live what I would call a retired life. A young widow Angie (Deepika Padukone) decides to help the old postman of the village Fredie (Naseeruddin Shah) to find his long lost love. He is depressed because it's now, after 46 years he finds out that the love letter he wrote to the woman he loved actually never reached her.In this mission of Finding Fanny, Angie ropes in her mother-in-law Rosie (Dimple Kapadia) the self-appointed Lady of Pocolim who calls the shots and throws her weight around with the locals. Savio (Arjun Kapoor) who loved Angie many years ago is back in town, he will drive the car as he is the only one who can, the car which belongs to Don Pedro, an artist who's interested in Rosalina. It actually is not the destination that matters here but it's the journey of these five characters completely different from each other but with clean hearts. There is an undercurrent of humour in the film, in fact some scenes will leave you in splits.Acting is top class. All the five actors Naseeruddin Shah, Pankaj Kapoor, Dimple Kapadia, Deepika Padukone and Arjun Kapoor display their best talent and put up an amazing show.Saurabh Dwivedi's review | Cinematography by Anil Mehta does a terrific job. The film is very well crafted. Music by Mathias Duplessy and Sachin-Jigar is perfect for this film. It's tough to get the music right, which plays a very important role and here it's clearly in sync with the director's vision. If you are expecting a masala film because it has Bollywood's current top actress Deepika Padukone then you will be disappointed because it's not one!?With Being Cyrus, Cocktail and now Finding Fanny Homi Adajania's filmography is quite a cocktail. To pull this off and make it entertaining is not easy, but it's clear he is an extremely talented filmmaker. If you are up for watching something different then go and watch Finding Fanny, you won't be disappointed." 
" Just Find a theatre to watch this fantastic movie :-)","Finding Fanny [4/5]When love doesn't come knocking on your door, you go knock on its door. Out of all the valuable lessons that Finding Fanny teaches you, this one is worth taking home! Finding Fanny is the story of Angie, (Deepika Padukone) the widow of Garbo (Ranveer Singh) who stays with her mother-in- law Rosie Eucharistica (Dimple), another widow. Angie believes that no one deserves an incomplete love story, so she sets out on a road trip with her mother-in-law, her friend Savio (Arjun Kapoor), the famous painter Don Pedro (Pankaj Kapoor) and Freddi (Naseeruddin Shah) to help find Freddi's long lost love, Stephanie Fernandes.The first half of the movie is very entertaining. Goa looks a lot more beautiful than what we have usually seen. The cinematographer is nothing short of brilliant! From the look of its trailer, Finding Fanny seems to be a comedy, it's not just that, it's a lot more.The second half of the movie seems to go by a lot faster than the first half and is filled with some very unexpected turn of events that leave you shocked and amused at the same time! The movie inspires you to act and seek out whatever it is that you want, instead of waiting for it to come by. By the end of the movie, you'll manage to smile through your tears.Whether you like this movie or not depends hugely on your taste. If you have been a lover of commercial cinema like Chennai Express or Kick, Finding Fanny might not interest you that much. But if you have a taste for diverse cinema, Finding Fanny is the right pick for your palette.All actors have done a fabulous job. My favourite of the five is Pankaj Kapoor, who didn't even had a necessary role as per screenplay, is just OUTSTANDING! Naseerudin Shah is very lovable and cute. Deepika is also good but she shines in narrating the story. Arjun Kapoor is revelation. He should try more roles like this. And finally, Dimple Kapadia. She should be applauded for accepting such kinda role that not everyone can play and she is fantastic. Background score is very good. And finally, the immensely talented director, Homi Adjania deserves the maximum credit for what he has delivered. One needs to be very creative in order to tell a dark and emotional story in an entertaining way. And he does a fab job. Finding Fanny is the best movie Bollywood has produced this year since QUEEN! Highly recommended :-) [4/5]" 
" Amazing Movie! A must watch for people who love quirky off-beat films.","First of all, watch this Finding Fanny in English if possible & not the Hindi Dubbed version. The English version is better.It's a niche film & if you like full on bollywood masala crap, this movie is not for you. It's for an intelligent audience. It has brilliant performance from veteran actors Naseeruddin Shah, Pankaj Kapur & Dimple Kapadia. Young actors Deepika Padukone & Arjun Kapoor surprisingly hold their own in front of these veterans, also their chemistry is very refreshing.The screenplay & direction by Homi Adjania is quirky & amazing. I remember I was a little disappointed with his last film Cocktail because I was not expecting something like that from him after the mind-blowing 'Being Cyrus' (which again was an off-beat film). But after watching Finding Fanny I can say that he's back to being his old self which is a good thing. We need more directors like him & more intelligent cinema than mindless masala crap which bollywood serves these days.A special mention for Deepika who not only looks breathtakingly beautiful but also gave another fine performance. After her 4 back to back superhits past year, I wasn't expecting Deepika to do a niche film like Finding Fanny but I was wrong. By doing a film like Finding Fanny which guarantees critical acclaim but not box office success, Deepika has proved that she's not here just to make money but wants to do meaningful films & give a great performance." 
" Wonderful cast, lovely movie","A delightfully slow meandering movie with a fantastic cast. Naseeruddin Shah and Dimple Kapadia and Pankaj Kapur absolutely rock this movie. Deepika and Arjun blend into this movie so well--but the movie is definitely the older three.Set in a quaint little village in Goa, the story is about 4 people who get thrown together on a road trip to "find Fanny" and the lessons life and love teach them on this journey. The scenery is so gorgeous and just emits a lazy, summery sunny afternoon sort of taste. The characters and the place seem to be caught up in a delicious time warp that makes you want to leave your electronic gadget filled busy life and just go off in search of this village. Naseerudin Shah and Dimple Kapadia are simply brilliant. Mr Shah doesn't he even have to say anything--his expressive acting is dialogue enough. Dimple Kapadia as the matriarchal mother in law who is a force to contend with, is an absolute star. I saw them both last in Being Cyrus and while it seems like an odd couple to throw together, they are absolutely perfect. A must watch--preferably the English version and not the one dubbed in Hindi" 
" A Collaboration Of The Finest Actors Conveying A Peculiarly Lovable Tale.","Finding Fanny definitely helps you in finding the expected solace. The plot presents a road journey involving a post master and his troupe of hysterical companions. I went inside the cinema hall with an expectation of experiencing something unusual and that was exactly what the movie bestowed upon me. Most of the Indian flicks in recent times are supported by hackneyed ideas and illogical story lines and this is the region where Finding Fanny stands out. Also, the film gets covered up convincingly within a tolerable run time of 110 minutes thus managing to keep the audiences awake. According to me, the conclusion drawn out was slightly stereotyped. But even then, it was acceptable.The performers assembled were certainly top-notch. Naseeruddin Shah is charming as ever while enacting the character of a depressed post master belonging to a delirious village. Deepika Padukone looks completely adorable while playing a lonesome widow. The naturalness that she is able to carry along with her throughout the movie is unquestionably worth admiration. Arjun Kapoor as Savio is greatly expressive. His last couple of projects have undeniably managed to bring out the best in him unlike his initial performances which were not really up to the mark, in my opinion. Dimple Kapadia is bold while playing the role of Deepika's mother-in-law. Pankaj Kapur too is one of the several laudable elements.Direction by Homi Adajania is fair. A quirky adventure where the protagonist tries to find his long lost love is wonderfully put on the big screen. Screenplay by Homi Adajania and Kersi Khambatta is odd yet likable. Editing and Cinematography departments have managed to pull of their respective jobs decently. Music by Mathias Duplessy is disparate and alluring. In addition to the above mentioned qualities, a number of unpredictably bizarre sequences are bound to leave you hilariously flabbergasted. If you are someone who is tired of watching clichéd narratives and masala dramas, then this must be the movie that you're looking for." 
" Humans die but love does don't..... Oooo Fany RE","Angie (deepika) and Roselyn (dimple) are two widows living at a quiet place called Pokkolim in Goa. Things change when the local postmaster Ferdie (naseeruddin) gets a returned proposal from Stefanie Fernandez, after 46 years. Angie decides to help the distressed Ferdie and to locate the missing Fanny (Anjali). The group is joined by Savio (arjun), Angie's ex, a car owner Don Pedro (pankaj) who has a strong desire towards Roselyn. What happens after that forms the rest.The director has come up with an unusual storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was quirky and engaging. The dialogues were witty and well written. The script was good and the screenplay made even better. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was magnificent and impressive. Editing was good. Costumes were well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was apt. Deepika Padukone looks very beautiful and she has merged herself into the role very well. Dimple Kapadia looks dazzling. Arjun Kapoor was first rate, Naseeruddin Shah was excellent, Pankaj Kapur was the best among the lot, he was simply mindblowing. Anjali Patil was brief. Others didn't get much scope.The film comes across like a breath of fresh air amidst the flood of racy commercial entertainers but then, it is also a subject that will appeal only to the thinking audience who seek intelligent entertainment . The first half goes on a lighter note with elements of comedy, some romance and also some bold scenes. The interval bang was good and the second half again has comic moments, but this where the films soul lies, that humans die love does not. Overall I enjoyed the film, it well acted, its quirky and funny, but the main strength is in the films soul. A highly recommend watch,because in bollywood films like these are not made every day.7.5/10" 
" Loved the movie and loved the message!","It is quite delightful to see a movie like this coming from bollywood roots although the star cast itself guaranteed that it was going to be a treat to watch performance-wise. Naseeruddin Shah, Pankaj Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia are all fantabulous actors and they lived up to their reputations perfectly... Deepika Padukone did her part in a not so glam role but some decent acting for a change.. The quirky humor and cinematography are exemplary. The story conveys so much. The cat, makes for such a moving scene where it is shown how important it is in life to not just own love but to nurture it too. A very small and yet so powerful statement being made and it was just a part of the entire story. The search for a lost love, to be so silent about it and keep it within when his persona is shown to be so irresponsible and insane is just so admirable. Its not always about the destination, sometimes just the joy of the journey is what is required... Its never too late to find a lost love when you've seen it and felt it.. Awesome movie, must watch!!!!" 
" A Classic Road Movie","Okay, Homi Adajania is back ! His first venture 'Being Cyrus' was at par with Hollywood standards; however, his next 'Cocktail' was equally disparaging. So, when I went for Finding Fanny, I did not know what to expect from this movie. And boy, what a movie it was !This movie is at par with directors like Alexander Payne and Alfonso Cuaron. In fact, half way through the movie, one might even forget that he is watching a bollywood movie. The cinematography, the direction, the background scores are breathtakingly beautiful. The ensemble cast of five, carry the movie amazingly well. The story, as in all road movies, is almost the same, five quirky characters set out on a road trip that will change their lives forever. The brilliance of any road movie is in that of the portrayal of the characters involved in it, and that being said, the real challenge of any road movie is in its characterization. That is where this movie stands out ! The performance by veterans like Dimple Kapadia, Naseeruddin Shah and Pankaj Kapoor is brilliant. However, in my opinion, it is Pankaj Kapoor who shines above all. He is the Indian equivalent of Paul Giamatti !Finding Fanny would give one the feel of watching a Wes Anderson or a Alexander Payne movie; and people who loves movies like 'Everything is Illuminated', 'Sideways', 'Little Miss Sunshine', or our Indian equivalent 'Road, movie' (The Abhay Deol starrer); would definitely love this one." 
" India's "Wes Anderson" film","The one unique feature about this film is that though it is shot in English and Goan, the English that is spoke is Indian-Indian-English. People speak this kind of English in Mumbai, Goa and neighboring places so I was pleased to see them play attention to the distinct language accent that various parts of India employs. I laud the director for that.I thought all the actors did a good job. The reason I saw this film was because it had come highly recommended and secondly I wanted to see what Deepika would do with a film where she has to speak in English. I came in with expectations but I enjoyed the film. It is very unique, some scenes are funny, the film has its own gripe with the character subtleties.The film is quite unpredictable except for the end. Yes, it is humorous but don't expect the best film of the year. It is far from it. It's a good film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Neither is it indulgent at all. This stands in its best favor.Dimple Ji was outstanding I thought. Arjun Kapoor who I actually dislike a lot was also tolerable so the director has done something right.Watch at the theaters, please don't be a cheap-skate and go with 7/10 expectations. Bye now." 
" A different way to see bollywood","I would like to say that this movie has proved that bollywood can make some sensible cinema apart from those crappy masala movies they make every year. This movie is different in almost all aspects. Pros...1. Acting is natural as the director has picked great talents for this movie. 2. Title song fanny is great. 3. Comedy is good no forced comedy. 4. Nasiruddin shah and Pankaj Kapoor are awesome as well as Deepika is hot in simple looks. Arjun and dimple had played their part well.Cons...Story is too simple some modifications could have helped to get more critics attraction." 
" Only for a niche audience!","The movie is not for everybody especially not for people who are used to the commercial capers which our dear old Bollywood is dishing out everyday!!well with a star cast of Naseeruddin Shah and Pankuj Kapur(brothers-in-law sharing screen presence together for the first time!!) you go in with high expectations and fortunately they both deliver class performances!Dimpal Kapadia and Deepika both contribute significantly. The only wobbly performance was of Arjun Kapoor as a sulky boy but his diction was not clear at times and expression the same for most of the emotions!!The movie is all about finding what we have lost in our lives but never had the courage to go about it to attain it. Though the dark humour and crisp editing is the movie's USP.All in all Finding Fanny is a relief from some of the past torturous movies i had to endure!!The cinematographer also has done a good job in capturing the picturesque Goa at its best." 
" A quirky tale with a Soul","Homi Adajania is back after his commercial mainstream outing in "Cocktail" to what he does best, tell another quirky tale of dysfunctional individuals which he convincingly told with his debut "Being Cyrus"."Finding Fanny" let me warn is not your run of the mill movie, it is abstract in its narration but the soul is at the right place.Homi Adajania adapts Kersi Khambata's story again after "Being Cyrus". "Finding Fanny" primarily tells the story of five individuals Angie (Deepika Padukone), her mother-in-law Rosie (Dimple Kapadia), her naïve affable friend Ferdie (Naseeruddin Shah), her mother-in-law's admirer Don Pedro (Pankaj Kapur) and her brooding secret lover Savio Da Gama (Arjun Kapoor). Based in a small village of Goa Pocolim, the story unfolds when these five principle characters take a road trip to find Ferdie's love, whom he confessed love 46 years back Stefanie Fernandes a.k.a "Fanny" (Anjali Patil). How each character comes to his own and discovers themselves is what the story is all about.The story premise by Kersi Khambata is wafer thin but it is the screenplay which accentuates the narration. It is the situations that make the story funny; each character is defined well with their set of eccentricities and insecurities. Kersi has done a brilliant job in defining the characters well. But I felt the proceeding goes from quirky to awry as the movie comes to an end. The climax could have been written better. But overall the pace never dips and at the end you have a smile. Well as I said earlier this is not your conventional film so do not expect the obvious.The Dialogues written by Kersi and Homi is the highlight of the movie which complements the narration and lifts the scenes. They are brilliantly written with subtle humor but the impact is hilarious.It is the performances by the ensemble cast which is a major highlight and the reason why the movie is a delight to watch. Homi undoubtedly had an enviable cast. Naseeruddin Shah as Ferdie, the emotional affable post master is brilliant. Naseer underplays his character,he has modulated his voice and his body language to portray Ferdie and the outcome is just mind-blowing. Pankaj Kapur who plays the eccentric lusty painter Don Pedro, he again proves his brilliance with this portrayal. Although amongst the five characters, Don Pedro's character is wafer thin as far as the writing goes but Pankaj Kapur with his portrayal takes the character to the zenith. It was delight to watch both the thespians in one frame. Dimple Kapadia as Rosie is brilliant and gives one of her best performances; she captures the nuances of Rosie's character well. Deepika Padukone again gives a good performance with Angie, Homi extracts another cracker performance after her Veronica act in "Cocktail". Arjun Kapoor as Savio, the brooding loser and lover shows his range as an actor.Anil Mehta's cinematography is so breathtaking that after watching the movie you want to take a trip to Goa. He captures the old Goa so well, something which has not been highlighted well after "Trikaal". Goa's beauty lies beyond the beaches as well and Anil has captured it brilliantly.Costumes by Anaita Shroff Adajania are so well done that it actually blends with the narration and does not look out of place. Production Design by Manisha Khandelwal is another highlight, every detail is painstakingly executed. The last highlight being the Music by Mathias Duplessy especially the backgrounds score, it just transports you to another world.Homi Adajania breaks the conventional norms of film making and tries to create an Indian "Little Miss Sunshine"; well he partially succeeds as well. The movie's unconventional take makes it for niche audience and it may not find takers in the masses." 
" A road trip into the nature of love","Finding Fanny is a simple anatomy of love. Ending with the finding that true love is a false epiphany. And along the way reflects on ego, the short life of lust, the razzle-dazzle of courtship, the pleasure of love in its barest forms.Very nice watch all along the way. Very good images, good aesthetics, authenticity of the location and Goan culture have been maintained. Music is good.The characters are all well developed and the actors, some of the best to come from India have portrayed them well. Except for the end where it rushes to an end, and leaves much less impact than it carries through the journey." 
" Finding Fanny is all about being Fresh..... :)","Finding Fanny: 4/5Now for every Film crazy personalities....who wanna go and watch movie with their brains in situ.....Finding Fanny is a treat....When commercial directors, use their age old policies of action, song, item and drama......Homi Adjania....again justified his name.....A movie based on Story (I wanna exaggerate the term 'Story') and some subtle and breath taking acting Finding Fanny... is sure to stole youur heart.....It is So fresh and airy,that every character looked lively and new....So a cute goan village girl, making an attempt to give her old friend Fernando his long lost love, took upon a journey with five mad men and a Cat....and what happens next..is FINDING FANNY...The film is gripy from the first scene, how they introduced Naseer sahab was really awesome...not only in case of Naseer sahab, the director introduced each and every character in a new and fascinating way....When there is an ensemble of such huge talents like Naseer Sahab, the mighty Pankaj kapoor and ever talented Dimple Kapadia with the newbie talent house Deepika and Arjun, one can expect that there will be a chaos....but no...instead each and every character will leave his/her mark on your mind....The First part was studded with some one liner intelligent comedy and some breathtaking acting by Naseer Sahab...While the second part melted with the flow though a little bit dragged to show Arjun and Deepika's romance...Fernando(Naseer sahab): Never missing a beat, he portrayed a cute romeo who waited for his lover for 46 years..and still attend choir with children...what a show...Rosie(Dimple): Old , Bossy, Grumpy and a gal with an incredible sense of fashion in a hilarious way....was the center of a master piece painting...indeed masterpiece....Her act was flawless especially the scene with Naseer and Pankaj.....and her love for the cat...my goodDiego(Pankaj): A man who earned applause over the years for his acting supremacy, won't disappoint u....His role was that of a lusty man, his lust for Rosie and her Physicalities was although very obvious, but the age old actor pulled it back and it never crossed the line of Vulgarity, A pure talent...Deepika: She proved that she have matured as an actress of top notch...she was fresh, her acting was unforced and she flowed throughout the movie like a star....there were many places where she will stole your heart..like while listening to Naseer from her Balcony, then her scene with Arjun in the field....and many more....Arjun(Savio): Aha man man, among all these celebrities, this relatively newbie, indeed, acted what was expected out of him...Never crossing the perimeters, just bang on spot each and every time...Cat: It will engage you all even after dying...Isn't it Funny....
