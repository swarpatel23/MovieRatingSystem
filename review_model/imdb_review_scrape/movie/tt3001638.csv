" An insult to boxing and Mary kom. APNE was better than this. just rouge rouge n more rouge.","Wow man. Make-up before training, make-up during training, make-up after training. The most plastic scene was the one when priyanka comes back home from jog or training n not a drop of sweat or messed look but clean face with oodles of rouge when she hugs her brother. Even when she is jogging, so much rouge man. Me and my friends were laughing in theatre during the scene when priyanka is practicing and she takes the punches in her stomach. The scene looked too fake man. I never came across school students with so much rouge in uniform. Just doing push ups and running here n there doesn't make one a method actor. Priyanka does not even come close to look like the real Mary Kom. She ain't no method actor. She looks more like DanielleÂ panabaker. This movie is just hyped. It's not even close to bhag milkha or other bio pics. She did not get into the skin of the character. I mean just look when she jogs or runs. She looks as if she is doing an advertisement. Appearance wise she did not even come close to Mary Kom. The stunts looked faked. She did not looked like a boxer. The boxing matches were the worst boxing matches choreographed. The producers were just looking for commercial value and that's why they settled for Priyanka. When you see Hillary swank in million dollar baby, she showed some good muscles. Look at poor Priyanka, no bloody calf muscles and I never came across any boxer who did not have good calf muscles. Overall a disappointment film and feel bad for the real Mary Kom. But kudos to the real Mary. And for Priyanka she should stick to aping Jennifer Lopez and making item songs for front benchers. She should stick to promoting her cousins (both the cousins r bad actors)." 
" good film","This week's release, Omung Kumar's MARY KOM is one such film which is a biopic on one of India's most illustrious sports personalities, Mary Kom, who, despite all her hardships, put our country on the international map with her achievements. The film goes on to show the real life story of this sports star, which not many are aware of. The film serves as an eye opener not just on the fact that India can produce international 'gold medal winning' boxers, but also that Manipur is very much a part of India! Omung does a great job of building up the climax with heart wrenching scenes where Mary chooses to box over spending a blissful life with her family. Post her opting to box, Mary accidentally lands up at the boxing training academy of her coach Narjit Singh (Sunil Thapa), who, after seeing her persistence, teaches her that 'the world maybe round for everyone, but her world should be the shape of the boxing ring, a Square'! Mary's talent for the sport combined with her coach's training form a deadly unbeatable lethal combo who go on to win international competitions galore.AL_janaby" 
" Mary Kom: With some flaws it's still great punch !!!","What's Good: Priyanka Chopra's career best performance. What's Bad: Dramatic climax.Bollywood always follow a trend of success.Since past few years the most successful genre is Bio-pics like Chak De India, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and now Mary Kom.This year only countable good movies have entertained us and most of them are women-oriented like Queen, Mardaani, Mary Kom.It seems like these women-oriented flicks are coming out at right time, as i have witnessed during the screening after the last punch the ladies gave standing ovation to Mary Kom.Mary Kom is about how a poor girl from Manipur made her way to top against all odds.Her struggle, her passion, her madness, her love towards Boxing made her 5 times world champion.Mary Kom might not be the best movie as it contains many flaws but still it stands strong just because of Priyanka Chopra's superb performance.She has held entire movie on her shoulder, she has given more than 100% for this bio-pic.Performances wise its only and only Priyanka Chopra. She is totally into the character and this is by far her career best performance.Supporting cast like Darshan Kumar, Sunil Thapa,etc are nice. Omang Kumar's direction is decent but it could have been better looking to the hold of the script. Music goes with the flow, cinematography is top-notch.Overall its a feel pride movie. Can surely recommend one-time watch." 
" Does not do justice","This movie is a huge disappointment. Billed up to be one of the most heart wrenching tales of winning against all odds, the result was a very highly dramatized offering. A good parameter to judge biopics is how much the viewer feels inspired after watching it and this film fails miserably on that account. Right from the start, the supposed hardships of Mary Kom do not ring true at all, thereby making it extremely hard to root for the protagonist.Though in the second half, this is somewhat salvaged by portraying the problems of a mother of two making a comeback to the coaching arena. Add to that the dramatization of many elements, making the whole movie feel very unnatural. The boxing scenes themselves are very bland and we rarely feel the tension that usually accompanies matches in good sport-movies.Expectedly, Priyanka Chopra carries the movie and gives a good sincere performance. If only the role had been a bit more of substance, she could have taken it to greater heights. All the supporting characters, particularly the husband, though relatively unknown play their parts well.First time director Omung Kumar should have worked a lot in making a tighter script. The dialogues are also very uninspiring. The effort of making a biopic on a woman sports person is appreciable but the result is not.P.S: The product placements of various brands in the movie is really annoying." 
" A bad treatment to an amazing real life story.","I will be honest with my review. I entered the hall with a lot of expectations already knowing the fact that the real life Mary Kom has had gone through a lot of struggle to become the champ, the first time, and once again after her marriage. But this movie does not justify her struggle one bit.I was never able to connect to the life of the protagonist and a lot of things didn't make any sense. For example, the first condition Priyanka Chopra keeps before marriage was that she wouldn't leave boxing. But she ties her boxing gloves to the back of her marriage car so they're trashed by the road. Was it a 'Goodbye Boxing' move? Further, I see only the husband doing everything after the marriage... a fact hard to digest for a considerably backward North-East region. Sometimes I felt the director should've kept the movie's name "Onler Kom" because he was the real hero for the most part. But no, the ever caring husband who's killing himself to keep any bothering stuff away from Mary decides to reveal about the 'hole in the heart' situation of their kid on the final day of the World Championship. And if someone doesn't know, this heart problem is kept under observation for a long time and immediate surgery is never recommended.The action was rubbish, as was the storyline, as was the soundtrack, and as was everything in the movie except the actors who've done a decent job. I feel betrayed, and heavily disappointed. If the director was able to display even half the real story of Mary Kom, a winner from not just a backward area, but a place where people reside in fear from both - the terrorists as well as the Indian army, I would've loved the movie. I've wasted my time and money on the movie."

" Disappointment !!!","Couple of brilliant knocks with plenty of bad misses. Could have been an excellent epic movie but overall turned out to be an average one. Tried to show a lot of things in a chaotic manner which lacked finesse. Pee Cee was sometimes good, specially the training period. The director seemed totally confused and lacked focus. There were plenty things which were over done like too much of useless aggression which could have been shown in a better way, people spoke in manipuri Hindi accent and again the same suddenly had a flawless Hindi outburst and the worst was Pee Cee in sweet 16 school uniform ... sorry utterly unaccepted. Its a good one time watch though, has all the content of a typical family weekend movie with love, inspiration, Patriotism and sportsmanship which again could have been like the outstanding "Rocky Balboa" types .... but sadly not, as I said a big disappointment !!!" 
" Great female biopic","Watching this film at 2AM and ended up still energetic and awake at 4AM. The duration of the film is 2hr 1minute. Not a single is boring. Trust me, this is a biopic of an Indian female boxer. The director fully utilize the actor in Priyanka Chopra. PC gaves her career best performance till date. This movie has a heart pounding climax. The film is an astonishing spectacular." 
" Strong Woman","I like how she proves to herself and others that she is strong. Very Inspirational to women in other countries who also want to do boxing. It is possible, and do not let anyone be sexist against you. This woman fought hard even though she got married and had children. That is so awesome how she worked hard. Not many mothers do that. That one guy she tried to straighten up was an a**hole but once again the movie is awesome. I did not understand the beginning when it first opened but now I have an idea why the movie turned out to foreshadow the rest of the movie. In the movie she battles with her family and lost touch with her own coach or mentor because he really wanted her to focus on her passion and career but she had to get married or else other drama would start. Even when she tried to convince him that she will be back and nothing will stop her, he still let her go until months later he sees her again trying to box." 
" Simply a good film.....","I have read a lot of criticism of this film lately. Many critics commented that the film lacked a proper melodrama and screenplay could have been bettered. Well, I also felt the film lacked certain punches in the screenplay; but overall, the film is a very sincere effort to present the life story of a sports person. I simply found three very strong reasons to admire this film.The first reason is the story. Very few Hindi films have done justice with the real life characters. And this one fully handles the story of a north Indian girl who defies her father by choosing boxing. Bollywood recently lacked good stories in its films and "Mary Kom" just sincerely fills the void. The second reason is its clarity in presentation. The film nowhere compromises for the formulaic sequences and remains truthful to its backdrop. Very few directors dare to make a complete sports movie which this does. And the last and the most strong reason is the performances. Though Priyanka doesn't look like a North Indian girl she steals the show by appearing ferocious boxer and a loving mother. Perhaps this is her second best film I've watched after "Fashion." Similarly, Sunil Thapa and Darshaan Kumar in very unpolished roles also do deliver good performances.Well, don't go with a great hype for this film. It's simply a good and a naturalistic film in a dearth of good movies. Trust me, you won't leave your seats with a scorn.Rating: 3 stars out of 4" 
" A biopic on Indian women boxing champion - Must watch for all sports enthusiast","I am a hard core movie fan and I was impressed after watching the trailer of 'MARY KOM' and decided that I have to watch this movie. I have always been a big fan of sports movies be it Chak De India, Iqbal or Lagaan. The movie is a 'Biopic' of Indian Boxer 'Mary Kom' who hails from Manipur. How she becomes Boxer, relationship with her father, struggles in career, discovering her husband and other hurdles faced on road to being a champion. What works in the movie?Acting: A brilliant portrayal by Priyanka chopra s Mary Kom, she has worked really hard for the film and you can clearly see that effort visible on the screen both physically (Training) and mentally (Acting). Cinematography: I must really applaud the way the cinematographer has pictured the boxing ring, locations, moods, emotions, lighting. Really good job. Music & BGM: The nom is, sports movies shouldn't have songs but major movie going population in India is accustomed to songs and the Director has managed to place the songs subtly in the movie intelligently. What doesn't work?Editing: Editing is very important aspect of the movie, it majorly determines the big factor 'length' The movie is about 2 hour 5 minutes and for a Biopic I thought this wasn't enough, it needed to be a bit long.Fight sequences: I was disappointed with the fight sequences in the movie. The boxing match that takes place in the ring should have been better choreographed, c'mon? You are showing a world champion boxer you got to get it as close to reality as possible. No comparisons but see the movie 'Million Dollar baby'.Direction and Screenplay: I think the director should have worked better on the screenplay which keeps the audiences hooked to the screen; there were moments where I was not interested on what's going in the screen. It's a challenging job for the director to capture a biopic as you cannot make major alterations to the story and you have to keep it as close to the reality.After watching this movie my respect towards Priyanka as an Actor has increased to the next level and I knew Mary Kom is a boxer in India but after this movie she holds highest respect as a sports person in my world. I give this movie a 7/10 and I would recommend a onetime watch. Oh and more point: You should stand up at the end of the movie if you are an 'Indian'" 
" Mary Kom: An Inspiring story with a Sincere Effort","Many times when you watch a movie especially a biopic which has an inspiring story you may overlook the flaws and technicalities, such was my experience with "Mary Kom".Debutant Director Omung Kumar brings life the story of Boxing Champion "Mary Kom". The story & screenplay of Saiwyn Qadras charts the journey of a daughter of a simple farmer Mangte Chungneijang from Manipur to becoming the 5 times World Champion MC Mary Kom or Magnificent Mary as she is called.Saiwyn's screenplay is shaky in the beginning but concludes on a high note. The first half looks more like a collage of incidents in Mary Kom's life put on celluloid with no cohesiveness in the narration and everything is shown in a hurry which does not have any emotional connect, but in the second half the movie takes a 360 degree turn in the narration and shows us Mary Kom's comeback after becoming a mother. The second half the narration shows a lot of depth and emotions which are depicted well concluding the movie to a high octane dramatic end. Though a lot of people will find the climax a bit dramatic but the bottom-line is at the end it strikes the right cord and you come out being proud of Mary Kom and her achievements. The other flaw in the script is that it does not delve deep in the other character's storyline.The dialogues by Ramendra Vashishtha and Karan Singh Rathore is good but quite inconsistent in the getting the language and the dialect right. Though the dialogues has a few Manipuri words being used but sometimes the dialect and language of the principal cast look a bit out of place especially Mary Kom's character.Omung Kumar's direction is sincere and honest and it comes through in the narration especially in the second half. The one flaw in Omung's direction is his hurried narration; he should have paid more heed to the characterization of other principal characters other than Mary Kom's. Though being Omung's first film as a director and choosing a biopic as a subject really needs a lot of conviction, and he shows the spark as a director.Performance wise it is definitely Priyanka Chopra all the way. She is sincere in her portrayal as a boxer Mary Kom, her whole transformation from a glam doll to a boxer physically right from the body language to the way she talks is to be seen to believe. Frankly I had my reservations about Priyanka portraying the role but she has really surprised me with her portrayal. Another stand out performance is of Darshan Kumaar who plays Onler Kom, Mary's husband the real pillar of strength in the boxer's life. Darshan 's underplaying the portrayal gives the needed depth required, an actor to watch out for. Sunil Thapa as Mary's coach does a good job.I have to mention the makeup artist Subhash Shinde who really did a marvelous job of Priyanka's transformation to Mary Kom, minute details like skin pigmentation etc has been taken care of. The production design by Omung's wife Vanita Omung Kumar is realistic and convincing. Stunts by Parvez Shaikh and boxing choreography by Robert Miller bring the required authenticity and thrills in the boxing sequences.Although it is not a "Million Dollar Baby", but it is definitely an applauding attempt which is worth a watch....." 
" Engrossing and Entertaining","Excellent movie that brings to life "Mary Kom".. her formative years, her rise despite setbacks and adversities. The story is narrated in a very crisp manner that keeps one interested all through. The movie starts from the streets of Manipur where a little girl discovers her passion for boxing and takes us through her life; through the different adversities and successes. This is not a typical Bollywood masala movie and potentially not for all. This is a serious effort and for those who like to watch stories based on real life. It is in the same league as "Black".Acting overall is excellent, Priyanka has done justice to the character. Other characters that have been portrayed well are the loving husband, the coach and Mary's dad." 
" Magnificent Mary...","Every Husband should be like him....and every one should be like Her....THe Magnificent Mary...... I went to watch the movie with a feeling that it will be a disappointment...Coz the promos were way to commercialised...But Just like M C Mary Kom.....The movie came out to be a huge surprise....The barfee gal...again showed....no one could have portrayed the living legend better....Set on the background of beautiful Manipur, the movie started with a pregnant mary being rushed to hospital by her husband Amisdt riot...It took a flashback, where a wild Manipuri girl,bashing guys, was trying to have a name in the male dominated society.....Chungnejiang was wild, not focused and raw...Priyanka never missed a single part to portray the legend's wilderness..From a farmer to World champion...It was never an easy task...Co-incidence bought that wild lady to the boxing arena, where her stubborness earned her a place in boxing...from there she was coached by yet another Stubborn but levelheaded coach of Manipuri boxing fed....She won back to back three world championship....got married, had kids and was forgotten...But no one can stop legends...with the help of yet another magnificent man, her husband, She fought back to earn a name, her name, her place....From there she won two more world championship and to make us very proud,She won India her first Olympic female Bronze medal in boxing at 2012....With such an inspiring story, magnificent star cast, appropriate songs, Dropdead gorgeous background and those essence from My NorthEast...Indeed the movie was grand....ANd by the end scene , I promise when u will stand up for the national anthem , u will shed tears of joy....and pride...Mary Kom is all about Struggle and Survival... Director Umang, Did a fabulous job..Screenplay was way betterKISIKO ITNA BHI MAT DARAO...KE WOH DARNA HI BHOOL JAE.... A mother, A Wife, A fighter, A multiple time world champion and olympic medalist.....she is indeed Magnificent Mary...." 
" Well done, PeeCee !","Priyanka, being the most versatile actress in the industry, has again made a brilliant performance in another womencentric movie. Biopics in India have always been very underrated. So will be this one. The best thing I loved about the movie is its flow. No melodrama and no typical 1970s thing. It's definitely a one time watch. But a must. The movie could've been a bit better. As most of the people are unaware of Mary's achievements, the director should have more elaborated a few scenes in the movie, is what I think. Otherwise, the movie is fab! You'll love Priyanka's performance so much that you'll first vote for PC for the best actress at the Filmfare website. Now, I am sure this movie won't do very well at the biopics. Because we are living in a country where people aren't much interested in watching such intense and beautiful biopics. But, that's not all. That is why Indian cinema is divided into two parts : Commercial and Art. So there's no need to feel bad if the movie doesn't perform well at the box office. It has def touched many hearts." 
" A decent biopic though too melodramatic at times","It's very difficult for a new director to make a biopic, also on a piping hot sportsperson. Omung Kumar known for his ads and his TV show Aur Ek Minute and some other stuff makes his directorial debut. The film shows the rise of Mary Kom, which though fictitious is well handled in most parts, however at times its too melodramatic and filmy too Omung Kumar also doesn't know how to justaxpose advertisements in the film and we have in your face publicity of ads. However the film does manage to evoke emotions and make you feel for Mary KomDirection is decent Music is good, the songs have the right emotionsPriyanka Chopra after BARFI is back in element, the actress was wasted in nothingness in films like Zanjeer and Krissh 3 though she did a great job in GUNDAY but in this film she gets to show her talent fully and she is amazing.Darshan Kumar is good in his role Sunil Thapa as the coach is too good rest are all good"
