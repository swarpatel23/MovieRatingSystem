" Bombay Talkies is something definitely in the elite standards to come out of the Bollywood of today","A conglomerate of four individually directed stories rolled into one , Bombay Talkies exhibits a sharp deviation from the typical mainstream and commercial Bollywood of today.Getting into the very first one , a 25 minute unusually bold attempt on homosexuality and the subsequent tantrums that follow, is undoubtedly and ironically enough , Karan Johar's best individual direction till date. A 8.5/10 for me.The second one was an absolute stunner of a direction from Dibakar Banerjee with its very poignancy being augmented by an impeccably brilliant acting from one man Nawazuddin Siddiqui at his versatile best. A straight 9.5/10 for me, if not more.The reel rolls onto the next half and here we have the third and what we have is a brave, mature, rich-in-content subject with a diluted direction from Zoya Akhtar. With the kind of subject it was, Zoya Akhtar could have made it look equipotent but no, it was not to be. Some unnecessary bits did actually mar the value of the subject. Expected more from an otherwise good direction from Zoya. This one bags a 7.5/10 for me.Just when you have got that feeling that it was gradually loosing out on the steam, the mastery of Anurag Kashyap storms in with another piece of mind blowing story ,the fourth one in the slot. A typical Kashyap showdown with a subtle flavor of tragedy molded in, the last few minutes of this one as well as the whole movie, sparked a standing ovation from the audience in the end. A terrific acting from Vineet Kumar like his Wasseypur brother Nawazuddin earlier, marked the very essence of the story, only if you are not too critical about mentioning the charismatic presence of Amitabh Bacchan. A rating of 9.5/10 will somewhat, still seem a tad bit less for this piece of story.And after "THE END" was shown, when actually it was not, and just when you feel you have had enough for the ticket you paid, you gotta sit back, only to see that Bollywood being revisited from the vintage past and present alike to mark its 100 years. On a confessing note, it was still not required and even if it was it should have been pr√©cised out to clamp on to the mood the movie had set. Some unnecessary sparkle-in-the-light stuff did partly dampen the mood in the end." 
" Not for Everyone","First off - This movie is not for everyone. Walking out of the hall, I could overhear conversations along the line of, "I thought this was supposed to be good?"In short, if you like movies from directors such as Vishal Bhardwaj, Anurag Kashyap, Dibankar Banerjee and the likes - you will love this film. If you are into mainstream bollywood, you will hate it.Also, although the movie is rated U/A, I would strongly advise you not to take your kids along. The first line of the movie is "I am gay, not a eunuch!". This was enough for the people with kids to stand up and leave. And anyway, this is not a movie for kids.Coming to the four films, #1 Karan Johar - Trash. Most of the reviews I read seemed to like Karan Johar's film, but I really didn't see the point. The film had little to do with Indian Cinema. People seem impressed with the fact that it's bold. It was bold, but forcefully so. As if Johar was trying very hard to be mature. The result was that the film seemed unrealistic and over the top with sexual references and jokes.#2 Dibakar Bannerjee - My Favorite. A failed actor (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) who gets roped in to a movie shoot. Beautifully done, and Siddiqui was brilliant as always. You feel emotionally attached to the character. I teared up. I am willing to watch this one over and over again.#3 Zoya Akhtar - Cute. A little boy who wants to be Sheila from 'Sheila ki Jawaani'. Nicely portrayed. The direction seemed novice though.#4 Anurag Kashyap - Oh! the irony. This one depended more on the storyline than on the screenplay like the others. I had high expectations from Kashyap and he did not fail me. It's a brilliant story and you will find yourself rooting for the character as he tries hard to meet Amitabh Bachchan.Overall, this is my opinion,The Best - Dibakar Bannerjee Also good - Anurag Kashyap OK - Karan Johar Not too great - Zoya Akhtar." 
" Well and Truly a celebration of Hindi Cinema","artistic...brilliant...honest...relevant....cinema... Bombay Talkies!! Karan Johar takes up a difficult topic and treatment of the topic and the characters and the scenarios, is all very, lets say, un-karan johar like....refreshingly artistic....the story lacks a closure, but you get to see a very very capable director in the short story!! Dibakar banerjee picks up a good short story, and an outstanding actor in Nawaz, to create his share of magic...Nawaz has again showed why he is easily among the greatest actors ever, anywhere, when it comes to displaying pain on screen...and,if you have ever done theater, you will be tempted to get up and salute this part...Zoya Akhtar picks up a Katrina Kaif item number out of the forgettable Tees Maar Khan, and still creates a brilliant story out of it...the treatment, like all the other parts, is extremely realistic...and performances, like all parts, brilliant!! After the above brilliant sequences, excellently made, and brilliantly acted, which would make you clap, on several occasions...and smile...and cry..comes up the sequence by Anurag Kashyap....and what better way to prove, that he truly is the king among the film makers today!! The final story, has Anurag Kashyap, at even his best...and you have a relatively unknown face (guy who played Nawaz's brother in GOW), giving an outstanding performance...this part is beyond brilliance...a simple story told and depicted in a masterful manner...its so good that at times, that you may laugh and cry at the same time (actually!) fitting tribute....thank you to the team....respect for Hindi Cinema...respect for Bombay Talkies!!" 
" Bollywood's Centennial deserved a better tribute","May 03, 1913 marked the day when motion picture was born in India, the day that Dadasaheb Phalke's silent film 'Raja Harishchandra' was released. A bit of trivia there is that the female roles in the film were also played by male actors, and the acting talent was drawn from theater. Till date, the influence of theater, and especially the roots from Sanksrit drama still play up in Bollywood's films. Surely, we love all the extra drama, sometimes characters yelling out lines as if they were on a stage before mikes were invented and the truly inimitable song and dance. And a film that is supposed to pay a tribute to a century of celluloid adventures of Bollywood that have enthralled not only Indians but even those abroad, ought to have been better. What was supposed to have been an extravagant celebration of cinema merely ends up like a moist firecracker. 'Bombay Talkies' is about four independent stories, directed by four reputed Bollywood directors, Karan Johar, Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar & Anurag Kashyap. Any analysis of the movie would have to be broken up across each of these four short stories, rather short films of 30 minutes each.#1 Ajeeb Dastaan Hain Yeh by Karan Johar has an urban couple Gayatri (Rani Mukherjee) and Dev (Randeep Hooda) whose lives go for a toss when a young gay intern Avinash (Saqib Saleem) enters their lives. The very predictable ending and the men kissing each other has a shock value and the story has actually no connection to the overarching theme of cinema or the centennial anniversary. #2 Star by Dibakar Banerjee is probably the better one of the lot. It has Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Purandar who has failed at business and employment. Just then, out of the blue, comes an opportunity to act as an extra where he shares screen-space with a big star. This brings out the inner theater actor in him that had starred in a couple of plays after his father, also an actor had passed away. The animated enactment that he performs for his daughter at the end is indeed very touching. #3 Sheila Ki Jawaani by Zoya Akhtar is about a little boy called Vicky (Naman Jain) who is attracted to the idea of dressing up as a girl and yearns to be a dancer a la 'Sheila' from 'Tees Maar Khan'. His father (Ranvir Shorey) is obviously annoyed at the idea. Nevertheless, the boy is supported by his sister. This segment has a cameo by Katrina Kaif who extols the idea of following one's dreams. Still can't really figure out whether there was even the remotest possibility of it being linked to the centennial. #4 Murabba by Anurag Kashyap is quite decent. A young man from Allahabad, Vijay who, as per his ailing father's wishes visits Mumbai to feed a Murabba to Amitabh Bachchan. He hangs around his Bungalow like many others who stand there for hours for a fleeting 'darshan' of the super-star. His money is drying up and he needs to hurry! On a stand- alone basis it would have made a good short film that on one hand, exalts the stars and then in the end, exposes the pointlessness of all fan-dom.Did you know? There was a real studio called 'Bombay Talkies' in Mumbai from 1934 to 1954 and produced 102 movies. It was a public limited company that was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Founded by actor Himanshu Rai and financed by Rajnarayan Dube, some of the names associated with this marquee include Devika Rani, Ashok Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Mehmood Ali, Madhubala & Dilip Kumar.The movie itself, however is absolutely underwhelming and leaves you a feeling of why did you even choose to watch this film. Some of the situations in some stories are so contrived, convenient and at times inappropriate too. One striking example of the absurdity comes from the first story, where an intern has the gall to make a first conversation loaded with innuendos to the assistant editor in his office. That is just one of the many things that won't fit into any reasonable logic, outright. Verdict: 'Bombay Talkes' is your typical pseudo-intellectual film. So, if you have a thing for parallel cinema, this is just the film for you. But, in the context of the occasion, it just not a film that pays tribute to a hundred years of Indian cinema. Only for that reason, I rate it as film that struggles to even make it to 'average'. The montage of all the stars in the end, which is actually a bunch of green-screen stuff put together, doesn't help either. So, don't waste your money on this one!" 
" India's 'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso'",""I don't think that writers or painters or filmmakers function because they have something they particularly want to say. They have something that they feel. And they like the art form; they like words, or the smell of paint, or celluloid and photographic images and working with actors. I don't think that any genuine artist has ever been oriented by some didactic point of view, even if he thought he was." ‚Äì Stanley KubrickMuch like the American or Italian movie industry, who made movies such as 'Hugo' or 'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso', which celebrates the art of movie making; Bollywood has its 'Bombay Talkies'Celebrating 100 years of Indian Cinema which was born in1913, we have four directors narrating four short stories in this movie. The stories though being each of a different flavor, has one common theme ‚Äìhow the life of the common man is percolated through movies. A similar themed movie was released few years back, Dev Bengal's 'Road, Movie' also explored the same arena; however, it's best not to compare these two movies at this juncture.The film opens with Karan Johar's segment. The story explores the hypocrisy and insincerity surrounding homosexuality. The segment delivers itself so perfectly, that one at times wonders that if Karan Johar has wasted himself in cheap commercial ventures for so many years. This is possibly Johar's most serious piece of movie making so far. The metaphorical usage of old songs such as Ajeeb Dastan and Lag Ja Gale, accompanied by sharp witted dialogs makes it a compelling watch. Also, this is the segment where Urban Mumbai is captured very beautifully.Dibakar Bannerjee's segment is arguably the best segment of the movie. Inspired from Satyajit Roy's 'Potolbabu Film Star', the story revolves around a man from lower middle class, a struggling actor trying very hard to make ends meet, suddenly landing up with a role in a movie. The protagonist portrayed by Nawazuddin Siddique, is one of the most layered characters that one would get to see in Bollywood ventures. Siddique has proved his worth time and again, but this time it is his absolute best. Also, Bannerjee's adaptation of a kid's story and changing the backdrop from the somber Kolkata to the rustic Mumbai is greatly commendable. The final scenes of the story, shows Siddique's profundity as an actor. It also proves that the duo of Dibakar and Nawaz is deadly on screen. Sincerely, hope that they make more movies together.Zoya Akhtar's story is about a child protecting his dream and the parent's urge to follow conventionalism. Child actor Naman Jain shines a light and so does Ranvir Shorey as a disciplinarian father. The final scenes would remind some of the Hollywood flick 'Little Miss Sunshine' at times. Nonetheless, the story remains very original.The last story by Anurag Kashyap is about a small towner's journey to Mumbai to meet the legendary Amitabh Bachchan to make him taste a half of 'murabba' as a part of his ailing father's wish. Anurag Kashyap who is usually known to think out of the box, dark gritty storytelling and using vivid imagery, surprises with a story that is so hopelessly positive. The movie is not only about the manic cine fans but also about a lesson learnt in life ‚Äì of the need of drama in our lives and of the guts to fulfill one's desires. The story resembles the Tom Hanks starrer 'The Terminal' at times but is awfully delightful and makes one hug himself with joy. The performance by Veneet Kumar is top notch.Bombay Talkies not only marks the 100 years of Indian Cinema, it also marks the coming of age of bollywood. For an industry which have only a handful of directors focusing on art house cinema so far ‚Äì that too mostly on independent banners; this movie is surely a benchmark which prods a truly ensemble cast and a tout ensemble directors that earmarks this industry into manhood." 
" Bombay Talkies: a true ode to 100 years of Indian cinema. Celebrates true art form of cinema instead of glorifying stardom. A must watch for true cinema lovers!","Bombay talkies is a true ode to 100 years of Indian Cinema. It celebrates life, emotions, relations, dreams of an ordinary human being. It celebrates the true art form of cinema. It doesn't glorify stardom.All 4 stories are diverse, dealing with different socio-economic strata with the basic theme being the impact of cinema on a common man's life.Away from all 'dishum-dishum' emotional atyachar, senseless stories, it tells us how cinema should ideally be.Karan Johar's part was really stunning. It was undoubtedly and unbelievably, his best movie as a director, better than those emotional craps like K2H2 and K3G. It talked about sexual orientation, hypocrisy in society and turnmoil in relationships. The songs 'Lag ja Gale' and Ajeeb Dastaan hai ye' were used metaphorically and blended very beautifully with the story. Dialogues were witty and had many meanings.Dibakar Banarjee's part was a true 'art cinema'. Full of sarcasm and metaphors and hence difficult to understand, it was genuinely the best of all the four flicks. Faizal Khan ( Nawazuddin) is a true genius. He plays the character of a man struggling to find a job who is a talented actor leading a mediocre life in a chawl, for whom a smile on his daughter's face matters more than his dreams and money. The EMU in a chawl sarcastically portrays the character of the protagonist and also Nawazuddin himself as he hasn't got his due still while he actually deserves much more.Zoya Akhtar's part talked about childhood dreams and fantasies. The child-actor really left me spellbound. The story was very genuine and it raised a very sensitive topic, which should be a matter of debate.Anurag Kashyap is my favourite and I went to the movie just because of him. But he actually disappointed me. Not because the flick wasn't good, but because I had lots of expectations from him. Still, Anurag kashyap's worst was better than the Karan Johar's best! It essayed the madness and love of the protagonist who is a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan and comes to the big city from Allahabad to deliver a piece of ' Murabba' .Although each story looked simple, the plot and the characters were multilayered. Each story is open-ended and leaves a lot to think about after you leave cinema halls. It should be considered as a benchmark in the history of Indian cinema.At the end, was a disgusting song trying to celebrate 100 years of Indian cinema. Well I guess it ended up being a sarcastic take on the STARDOM ( read it "StarDUMB") culture prevailing in Indian cinema.Its a high time to realize that cinema is a reflection of the life of ordinary 'Homo Sapiens' and should not be used to glorify larger than life image of some aliens like RajniKant, Salman Khan, Shahrukh Khan et al." 
" One Film To Describe Em All .............","-Segment 1. Karan Johar. Begins with perfect kick to put you in the situation of character and after that pace only develops . Unhappily married couple,frustration towards life and reality,choices and their importance,sexuality and perspectives towards it,redemption and other valuable emotions were perfectly balanced with intensity,sense,power and dramatic effect. -Not at all melodramatic (unlike Karan),perfect use of resources,good performances by Rani and Saqib and Randeep Hooda is great. -Powerful dialog /screenplay and crafty execution . -Complete surprise for the one who is aware of the kind of work Mr. Johar is into,i personally never expected this kind of approach from him. -Perfect character development and pace ,looking at the time frame the movie was suppose to exist into but looked rushing towards the approach in some parts,and i would love to see this movie if made as a full feature ,because it lacked the perfect finesse that only time would have provided . -But overall it was very good and Karan Johar would have been the last person ,i would have expected this from .Rating - 7.6/1O.-Segment 2.Dibaker Banerjee. Rush and high dose of emotions first part gives you this segment actually balances that and starts into a life of an eccentric unsuccessful lower middle class man (Nawazuddin in his career best performance,and i have no idea how he manage to deliver that every time) for whom the prosperity and happiness of his family matters but he have lost himself. After that particular day he was forced to introspect but because of his circle of thinking which was confined that never helped him materialistically but gave him what he was looking for ,happiness for him and his family and experience of a lifetime. -Perfect performance by Nawaz(the sole character of the movie),when he is into the skin of his character ,you are not on your seat but with him right where he is and what he is thinking,and it is not easy to engage someone in this way. -Direction and treatment was amazing,and the screen time was perfectly utilized,artistic approach towards the introspection and character inside were great. -There is maximum of one way towards your understanding of what this is all about,so it really makes it hard for the work of Mr. Banerjee to be accessible to everyone in exact same proportion ,which is the weakest aspect commercially. -Perfect art.Rating - 8.O/1O.-Segment 3. Zoya Akhtar. This segment is about dreams and your responsibilities towards protecting them . It explore the themes of manhood,insecurity of people because of their bounded thinking,complexities of human relationships and behavior and of course aspirations and dreams .-Direction is good,execution is clean but content is limited. -Had the potential to be even better .Rating - 7.O/1O.-Segment 4. Anurag Kashyap . The final segment of the movie is satire and thoroughly enjoyable approach to find the ,fiction of reality. The title character was desperate to get a wish done of his father,which was to make his favorite actor have a piece of MURRABBA ,but it is not as simple as it looks. Here Mr. Kashyap not only reveals the involvement of cinema into the lives of many people but also takes it to next level by making it clear about the human psychology which demands the need for drama into our lives which makes us do things beyond our routine. Not only it explores the extreme human condition of craving for something but on the other hand it does not mind completely bashing it for how useless it can be . Metaphor of cinema is used ,which lends this work its sense of motive(does not matter in a good way or bad). -Performances are good. -It not only engage you on intellectual level but also on any level possible ,which works great for a wider audiences . - Interesting direction ,balanced screenplay,funny dialog and best situations for the characters to react into . -A must watch for fans of Anurag Kashyap. Rating - 7.6/1O .Overall ,if talking about the emotions, One Film To Describe Em All." 
" Bombay Talkies is Slice of Life..But only for whose hunger is for artistic cinema. PART I.","When I clicked on 'Write a Review' I was just thinking what to write, because this flick showcased things that are beyond words for me. I can never explain the true emotions for the movie in words. But lets try.OKAY, so after watching movies like Race 2, Aatma, Himmatwala, Chashme Baddoor, Ek Th Dyan, Iron Man 3 etc. Finally I watched a meaningful, sensible, mature and cult cinema with Bombay Talkies which finally delivered what I was waiting for since the year started. Penultimate humor, drooling scenes, moving dialogs, sketchy screenplay and flawless execution in pure art form with no 'masala' makes it a masterpiece for me. Now I won't recommend it to all as for sure there'd be a group of people who will like it thoroughly and among them, even lesser will understand its true worth.BOMBAY TALKIES.** REVIEW & SUMMARY **It is made to celebrate the 100 years of Indian Cinema and it shows its impact on our lives. That's the creme layer about it, deep within the movie basically deals with the THOUGHT PROCESS of different people, their mentality, approaches, reactions and treatment towards different topics and the way of life. It is also about the skills honed by them accordingly, shedding its root somehow or the other from an impact of Indian Cinema on them. Four ace directors come with four segments (25-30 minutes each) in total which are diversified by the topics they deal with and no strings attached in the stories. And hence let's dig deeper into them individually but in my second review.For crisp and short, all in all, Bombay Talkies was a lovely journey, a delectable twist this year after so many trash movies, a brilliant and intellectual masterpiece, pure form of art and a tale that does not only celebrate the completion of 100 years of Indian cinema but also reacts as a mirror for us to wake up and think while relinquish this 'Watch the movie-leave the theater' attitude along with quenching the thirst for more of these kind of eccentric movies and the change of taste for commercial oriented audience and movie-makers. As a whole I would rate Bombay Talkies for its blunt and artistic approach towards commercial mass as 8.2/10." 
" Pure But Hasty Filmmaking!","What a wonderful act is that four talented directors come together with some of the great new-age actors to create an amalgamated cinema worth watching. But, is it the much-needed ode to Bollywood? Hands down, No!Karan Johar starts off with a very bold story having marvelous performances by the lead actors. Great direction, dialogues & the elemental conviction is absolutely fantastic. The conclusion troubled me maybe due to incompletion but that's expected. And yes, it immortalizes homosexuality, 50 Shades of Grey & sex. 7.2/10!Dibakar Banerjee teams up with the Siddiqui but fails to evince character depth & the real matter. Although, the emotive stance is appreciable, the momentum which is required to stand up in a movie of so much importance is low. Sadashiv Amrapurkar was good. 5.7/10!Zoya Akhtar brings sweetness to the anthology with brilliant acting by child artistes. Although, the climax is a bit stale & illogical (so much crowd attraction for 2 kids), I liked the love, bonding, chasing-the- dream thingy & iotic traces of child-abuse involved in it. 6.3/10!Anurag Kashyap's is the cynosure with a story so sharp & related (to native India), it makes a great ending story worth watching. Amitabh Bachchan's presence, the placebo effect-story, palpable plot & the lead character's expressions make it the best short. Great music. Splendid. 8.5/10!Overall, a good show put up by the thespians & succeeds in marking a new wave of cinema making, but I really think all work was done hastily with the stories requiring little polishing & improvisation. Could have been better!BOTTOM LINE: A good movie & can be considered one of 2013's few best! Recommended!MESSAGE: Respect the LGBT community & understand that relationships is more than physical; make a person happy everyday; follow you dream surreptitiously; be with your parents when they need you & make their wish true.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: Mild | Sex: Strong (No visuals) | Nudity: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Very Mild | Alcohol: Mild | Smoking: No | Drugs: No" 
" Coming of age of Indian Cinema","It's ironical that a short film is the best thing that Karan Johar has churned out in his entire career. Initially I was apprehensive that a completely commercial director like Johar might find himself out of place in such a melange of fantastic directors like Anurag Kashyap and Dibakar Banerjee,but he managed to deliver. The subject matter of homosexuality was bold and deftly handled. Kind of depicted the coming of age of Bollywood. It was the first story and easily a 8/10. The second short made by Dibakar was the best of the lot. Nawazuddin who has managed to carve out a niche fan following in Bollywood, caught the eye of the viewer with his completely lovable performance as a lower middle class family man, with the gift of acting. 9/10 The third short directed by Zoya was a kind of let down. Specially after watching the last one, although the story was heart warming but it did not manage to touch the heart as much as one could have expected. 7/10 The final short directed by the maestro himself Anurag Kashyap was up there competing with Dibakar for top honors .It had comedy and drama ,and the last five minutes was especially beautifully made. Typical Kashyap stuff 8.5/10. As we were trying to leave the hall as soon as the last short ended we were warned by the usher that there is still something left to see, we waited and was greeted with a huge song with montages of famous films starting from the yesteryears down to the modern age of Bollywood.Then the silver screen was greeted with the so called Bollywood "Stars" and the crowd was screaming at the top of their voices.If we can leave this last part out this turned out to be one of the better films to come out of Bollywood recently." 
" Banerjee's Work is So Rich and Alive It Blows The Other Works Out of Water. Kashyap Holds His Own But Akhtar Struggles and Johar's Work Seems Flaccid In Comparison.","Director Dibakar Banerjee is keener in establishing the little world his characters, both major and minor, inhabit. You are far more enthusiastic and involved with these people because Banerjee knits together the entire fabric of his creation rather than simply weaving the design; he allows his camera to capture the sight, the sound and the essence of his world and you are respond and reciprocate it to it more than you would to works by other directors. He is one of the best new Indian directors I have seen whose films have gotten far less credit than they deserve. Everyone talks about Karan Johar's or Anurag Kashyap's involvement and only a few (which includes me) may've gone for Bombay Talkies to watch out for Dibakar Banerjee. His segment is called Star and it comes right after Johar's opening segment; Banerjee's work simply blows the other segments out of water, and only Kashyap's Murabba is able to escape uninjured. But poor Zoya Akhtar's segment Sheila Ki Jawaani isn't very lucky, barely holding up to the standards of Banerjee's work. And Johar's hokey gay-themed segment seems flaccid in comparison. I don't mean by saying all this that you should skip the other segments and only catch Banerjee's; Bombay Talkies is a far better offering than most other Indian movies you might catch in theaters. It's got a limited release and has managed to rake in mediocre box-office collections, but it surely deserves to be recognized for being novel not just for the sake of being novel. Four different directors with quite different styles and palettes put up their works for an anthology film and you as an audience member have a lot more to discuss here than just the quality of the film itself: you compare these filmmakers' works and form your own preferences. I loved Banerjee's work but I hear many other praising Karan Johar more, but you see what's happening here is that everyone's talking a lot more about the film than they usually would. For this alone people should catch Bombay Talkies before it exits theaters with its final salute to Bollywood. Bombay Talkies, named after a prestigious movie studio of the same name which opened in the 30s and has closed down now, is a cinematic ode to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Bollywood. This ode is sung by four directors: 1) Karan Johar, known for his epic-length melodramas with names usually beginning with letter 'K', 2) Dibakar Banerjee, a superbly talented director whose works evoke the multiplicities seen in Neorealist films 3) Zoya Akhtar, who has won a couple of awards in India and comes from a family of talented actors, musicians and lyricists and 4) Anurag Kashyap, whose works have been screened at Cannes. While Johar and Akhtar share this style of directing that many of the filmmakers who've been brought up in this industry from the start possess, Kashyap and Banerjee inject the flavor of world cinema into commercial Bollywood.Johar begins first, his film being about Avinash, a lonely gay man estranged from his family who meets a lonely married straight woman whose sex life (with her husband, of course. Infidelity not usually tackled in Indian films) is sterile. There's the husband who is dull and lonely (and completely not aroused by his wife) and loves old Hindi songs, and things get complicated when Avinash meets the husband and his gay sensor tingles. You perfectly know what's going to happen next. Once Johar's done, its Banerjee's turn: his film is about a lower-middle class Maharashtrian (Nawazuddin Siddique, awards coming your way) whose many little ambitions, which includes breeding Emus, have never taken flight until the moment he gets the golden opportunity to share the screen space with megastar Ranbir Kapoor one day. If Banerjee makes us hate the theater owners for keeping an interval for the film, Zoya Akhtar's segment post-intermission about a little kid who hates football and likes dressing up like a girl and who idolizes actress Katrina Kaif makes us hate the film's editor for not including more of Dibakar's story. The final segment is a little queer and quirky, and it's by Kashyap; his film is about Vijay, an Allahabad native who, under his ailing father's insistence, travels to Bombay to offer the King of Bollywood half of a Murabba, a jam pickle, so that the other half, once blessed with Bachchan's uhm¬Öteeth could be consumed by Vijay's father to get well. Johar's segment is simple are quite predictable; you are well aware what's going to happen and because it's a Johar film, you know there'll be a lot of tears shed by the characters. Apart from its hokey and hackneyed theme, I really wasn't sure whether it portrayed gays in a flattering light. Akhtar on the other hand makes a film full of annoyingly precocious children and one-dimensional characters, especially the kid's father who keeps repeating 'Football is a guy's game. Football will make you strong'. Anurag Kashyap's 'Murabba' is delicious and delightful, but not anywhere close to the richness of Banerjee's offering. There's so much to enjoy, so many little things that we watch happening in Banerjee's film, and he's a pro when it comes to handling his camera and sound. There's a common theme of father-son relationship running in all four shorts. There's a music video after the shorts which celebrates the hundred years of Bollywood, and they've added a montage that shows Bollywood through the period. Towards the end, stars like Aamir Khan turn up but I was sadly disappointed by the presence of some actors like Sonam Kapoor here, which shows just how retarded Bollywood has become. Why couldn't they let Nawazuddin sing? Or Kalki Koechlin? When your entire film is about celebrating the true stars, why ruin the moment by bringing in the hundred crore club whose films are strapped on stars and short on sense?" 
" Absolutely not a tribute to 100 years of cinema","Watched this movie and sad to find that this movie does not represent Indian Cinema. Yes, there are few well known and few lesser known Indian movie directors but this movie is entirely out of context and misguiding us by saying that this is a tribute. Before starting to say anything about the movie I would like to say that "I watch hundreds of movie in a year, across the genre, language and ages!" Bombay Talkies is only meant for multiplex goers but they may also find it boring, there is no quotient of entertainment and I am sure no director tried to make it for entertainment. You can find few funny scenes in Abhinav Kashyap's movie but that's not enough to save the movie. Karan Johar's movie is confusing, I am still not able to understand what he wanted to convey? Seems he made his part hurriedly and just to be part of this movie, It creates doubt in my mind that whether he actually directed this movie? Dibaker Banerjee's part was mix of good acting and direction but nothing to say, Maximum Dialogues in Marathi with English Subtitle if they wanted to make this real then why not Abhinav kashyap's Movie in Bhojpuri? Even it's main character is from Eastern UP. One of the most over rated director called "Zoya Akhtar" is also found a part to direct and I can bet this was not on the basis of merit, hence result is no exception, completely forgettable part with no substance. I found the last part is interesting and entertaining, you can also call fourth part as "Tribute to Indian Super Star Amitabh Bachchan and as well as Indian Cinema", with lot's of emotions and originality, you can feel the importance of every small things which middle class faces in their lives. My 3 start goes to only this part, rest directors were only showing off that they are part of this movie and they are in top four directors of the country hence 0 marks to them for their arrogance. I really hate how these guys are giving interviews on news channel and showing unnecessary thoughts. Yes, there is a song in credits where you can find famous film personalities lip syncing with that song and I think only this song which is giving tribute to Indian Cinema, but if this is the case then just go and watch that video on youtube in full HD and forget the movie."

" Experimental Bollywood.","My Rating : 7/10Not often does Bollywood make something out of the ordinary. No song and dance routine here. Here we have four short segments directed by four well-known directors.All four stories will appeal to a different audience and perhaps might even offend some for their respective themes explored.Not your commercial, mainstream entertainment. Niche, subtle filmmaking it is." 
" Not all it's cracked up to be But has its moments and Katrina is Hot as they say in B'wood","Stuttgart Indian Film Festival, 2014 -- What "Bollywood Talkies" Talks About By Alex Deleon-SinhaDespite its promising title the compilation film "Bollywood Talkies" has little if anything to do with The Last Hundred Years of Indian cinema and more to do with some more recent thematics such as homosexuality, cross dressing, anti-machoism, the public obsession with Katrina Kaif and Indian film in general, plus the public Deification of actor Amitabh Bachchan. The only part which directly addresses the history of Bollywood was the spectacular musical collage featuring clips of some all-time superstars tacked on at the end. My only complaint on that part is that it all went by too fast!!! Indian critical comment was mixed, to say the least but one leading Bombay scribe described it as worth seeing just to see four prominent younger directors of feature films making their statements in a shorter form -- like novelists working on short stories. Kerala director Sanjeev Sivan says the film is abominable -- "and you can quote me on that" -- never a gent to shy away from controversy Sanjeev -- as we shall see from his film skedded here tomorrow. For the record:Part 1 by Karan Johar Ipersonally found quite interesting partly for the ripely maturing undeniable appeal of actress Rani Mukerji in the role of a most attractive but frustrated wife of a man who turns out to be a closet gay. It is a wide open secret in Bollywood that Johar himself is of same-sex sexual preference, so this piece can easily be viewed as his own "coming out" statement. Well made and acted but with an unnecessary tacked on ending.Part 2: by Delhi based Bengali director Dibarkar Banarjee. This is mainly notable for another striking performance by star character actor Nawaz Siddiqui playing a feckless wimpy wannabe actor who accidentally wanders onto a street film shoot and is selected from the crowd for a few seconds walk-on with a single word of dialogue, "hey!". This is clearly intended as a sidelong satire on the Indian public obsession with Bollywood and the adulation of film stars. Not seen but mentioned is current Bollywood heart- throb Ranbir Kapoor whom Nawaz is supposed to bump into by accident in his mini film debut. Ha-ha for that.Part 3 by female director Zoya Akhtar hits three interesting themes in this sweet segment: Confused sexual identity, in this case an 8 year old boy who is a budding transvestite; the blustery macho identification with sports by a father mortified by his son's behavior, and more commentary on star adulation, in this case the amazing meteoric rise to Bollywod stardom of voluptuous half-breed Anglo-Indian actress Katrina Kaif, which is actually a study in itself. The child hero of the film sees Katrina on TV doing an extremely sexy item dance number in a recent film and is so taken with her image that he puts on his sisters dresses and starts to gyrate √† la Kaif. At the end he gives a Kaifian dance performance in a kiddee show. If one is aware of the Kaif phenomenon in Bollywood this Zoya segment speaks volumes. A live TV interview with Kaif summarizing her amazing embrace by Bollywood -- a gal who couldn't even speak Hindi at the outset of her career -- is alone enough to validate this entire piece -- my own favorite of the four -- and, Okay -- let's face it, Katrina's belly dancing makes my precious natural juices flow freely ... I am -- ulp, Mea Culpa -- a fan of hers! As for Part 4 by Anurag Kashyup, director of the monumental Gangs of Wasseypur, the less said the better. This is, if anything, a monument to time-waste and a pointless attempt to remind people that Amitabh Bachchan enjoys the status of a living God in the Bollywood pantheon ... Obviously pumped out in no time to pick up some spare change and maybe get in some brownie points with the real King of the Bollywood hill." 
" A tribute that says, we have come a long way.","A tribute that says, we have come a long way.It was May 3, 1913 when Dadasaheb Phalke's Raja Harishchandra was released. A 100 years later we have been through so much and come to a point where so much has been done and there is still so much to do.Bombay Talkies is a kind of tribute that has only one connection, it is about people who are affected by films, by music, by their actors, by dance and by acting. Apart from this one fine line, there is nothing similar or connecting these stories and thats a great thing. Now, let me begin with each storyKARAN JOHARWe have the Indian Version of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and Karan stuck to the safe zone and made what he is good at making. I always had a problem with this guy and even in this, he cannot show us anything different apart from the obvious. He has never risen above the script as a director and sticks to his ground so very firmly that it may ache others who have watched his films. He seemed to be a complete misfit in the lot as others have surely done some brave films while he stuck to films that are typical for Indian diaspora. But here, we have a Karan who can also make a hard hitting film and showing us a very taboo issue in the face devoid of the very typical Karan Johar trappings. Simply, we have a different Karan whom I did not see before. In this segment, we have great acting from Rani and Saqib Salim as Avinash and that little girl who sung those Madan Mohan songs of "Lag Jaa Gale" and "Ajeeb Dastan Hai Yeh" so beautifully that I have fallen in love with this girl. As a story it's hard hitting as it's rarer to such thing in the milieu that we have grown and Gay is still a taboo issue to our society and this is unveiled in a brave way by Karan and just kudos for his bravery and even the outcome. So that's a story that has Hindi Film Music as an underlying theme.DIBAKAR BANERJEEHis story, inspired from a Satyajit Ray short story (I read about this inspiration in other reviews after I watched this movie) of how an encounter with a superstar changes his day and brings back hope to a man.Nawazuddin Siddique brings life to a mundane character. In fact Nawaz brings more than life to this character and makes him the hero in us, the hero we root for. A passion so exuberantly portrayed that we rarely find such infectious enthusiasm on the screen. Nawaz, I must say is infectious and I am having a fresh memory of the innuendos he did. From repeating famous lines from the old films in preparation to just a single letter word dialog to feeding his turkey. He does every small nuance well and it's a performance that's flawless. There is a long shot amidst big buildings where he repeats those lines and I loved Dibakar's vision of that. Dibakar avoided close ups and gave me a real life personality. And more, this has a surrealism too and there is a surprise package there. It's an epiphany that I loved so much and wished it was longer and longer.This is the most personal, reliable and my favorite story of the lot and am so happy for what Dibakar did. Also, a big thanks to Nawaz. This a short film with acting as it's underlying theme.ZOYA AKHTARI can say, that is either inspired from BILLY ELLIOT even if ZOYA AKHTAR denies so. This is a story of a kid, who wants to become a Bollywood dancer, that's OK. But, this boy, wants to become Sheila of Sheila Ki Jawani. Ah, that's kind of weird and there in lies the beauty of the film. It's OK to chase a dream however weird it is as long as one pursues it. Also, it's OK to hide a dream from those who are uninterested in one. And who said, dreams do not payback, they surely do and therein lies the essence of life. Living a dream is tough, we have to overcome too many obstacles and living a weird is next to impossible. But, when there is a will, there is way and that's what this short film clearly shows. ANURAG KASHYAPIF every one got some good actors or even superb actors, this film stars Amitabh Bachhan, the quintessential hero, the superstar himself. Anurag indeed has bagged the most important actor of the century for this. Yet, the protagonist is not Bachhan but a "Murabba" which is just tasted by Bachhan. It's the story of a fan who comes all the way from Benaras to Bombay just to give Bachhan, a bit of his moms Murabba as per his fathers wishes. He struggles, waits, hopes and finally achieves. Vineet Kumar as Vijay seemed so very fluent on screen. This one has subtle humor and it's in a way good as that helps a lot to this nearly routine kind of fable. The climax comes with twist and indeed a moral that Murabba should never be kept in the bottle used for pickles. Wow, Anurag does have a sense of humor thats so very native to us. I can say this is Indian Humour at its best.Now, I am going with 4/5 for one of the finest amalgamation or compilation I have seen of short films. Having said that this is not for the general cinema audience who goes for nothing but some mas ala and entertainment. It's for the aficionados and connoisseurs It's not provocative either but yes evocative in a way. It's not deeply affecting but it will move a few chords in heart for sure. Go watch it."
