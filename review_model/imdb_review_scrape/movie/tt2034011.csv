" Strictly remain far away from this.","Sagar Ballary, tasted success with his first directorial venture BHEJA FRY and then later on made some vaguely attempted comedies including the sequel of his first film. But not even one of his later ones was able to impress the viewers and HUM TUM SHABANA is also not an exception to that fact. May be the actual reason behind this is that BHEJA FRY was a scene to scene lift from a French Film and all his other films are not a blatant copy of any other Hit from the World Cinema.Besides, his latest flick HUM TUM SHABANA is regrettably the worst attempt made by the director which is annoyingly loud, silly, irritating and a big pain especially in its second half which can easily be termed as intolerable too. The film starts off with an interesting plot of a beauty pageant where two boys from the organizer's team are trying to win over one of their lovely contestants. But just after the first 30 minutes, the execution becomes frustrating and you are not able to enjoy anything in the entire later part of the film. Particularly its last hour can give you a severe headache with all that noise and shouting going on in the name of a comedy.A film can only have good performances if the script allows the artists to perform and the director has got a particular vision to follow. But HTS, in absence of any appreciable script or a basic vision of the director, simply wastes all the talent hidden in the names such as Satish Kaushik, Shreyas Talpade, Tushar Kapoor and Sanjay Mishra. The ladies Minissha and Pia are also there only as the beauty mannequins and are not going to get any kind of response from the movie itself.Actually, as I felt, the biggest culprit of the film is its Sound Mixing in which we have a very loud background score continuously being played along with the dialogues throughout the film in a very unintelligent manner. At times the effects are so deafening that one fails to hear the funny lines said by the actors and feels like walking out of the hall. Yet, there is only one positive thing in HUM TUM SHABANA and that's the work done by the music director duo Sachin-Jigar who come up with some catchy numbers like "Hey Na Na Na Shabana" and "Music Band Na Karo", which are sure going to be played in the pub and discos.Overall, strictly be far away from this if you want to keep your peace of mind intact."
