" watchable for madhuri and juhi's performance","First, i would like to appreciate the director for making movie on gulabi gang. which is already a world famous and some people doesn't know about it in most parts of India. First i thought the movie would be only on revolution against injustice to women. But gulaab gang fights against every injustice in their village where men come to them ask their help,which is impressive. there is also political drama which makes you interesting to watch. After watching the movie i started surfing online about gulabi gang and it's leader sampat pal. Men might be against the movie or the gulabi gang. But what i want to say is common yar, let them do at least which we men have no courage to do. when it comes to the movie,you may watch it once for madhuri and juhi. rest of the cast also did their job very well. i'm sure it won't disappoint you. performances of entire cast will make u sit through the movie. that's enough to watch a movie i guess." 
" Do not miss this..........","After watching the movie on the first day of its release, I was eager to read the reviews. But i was shocked to learn that critics have rated this film as average to poor. If you watch a film wearing magnifying glasses you will surely find errors in every film. But this film, which is made with such conviction surely deserved better reviews. The highlight of the film is its star cast. Juhi Chawla is excellent as the evil politician. She brings so much life into the diabolic character that you get goosebumps whenever you see her on screen. Juhi is totally believable as as a malignant and immoral lady. Madhuri too has acted well, but something was lacking in her characterization , due to which this does not make one of her memorable performances. Rest of the cast is also good. The actresses who played madhuri's associates have delivered a great act. Despite having no male lead actors, the film is thoroughly entertaining. It is thrilling to watch the confrontation between Madhuri & Juhi. I wish the critics had set aside their double standards and watched the movie from audience's perspective. This film is far better than multi million grossing films which i feel are making fool out of the audiences." 
" Madhuri has wasted this golden opportunity","When the opening credits started to roll, I was mighty impressed by the animated work in the background. However, half an hour later, I started to get this sinking feeling that "this animated work" would probably be the only thing impressive about the movie.First things, first. When you make a realistic or "art type" film and that too based on/inspired by true events, the handicap faced is that most viewers are already aware of the topic and those who aren't have this knowledge thrust upon them by the untiring media. Therefore, the filmmaker has no choice but to stick to the basic storyline and extract extremely good performances from the star cast to be able to hold the viewers' attention and this is precisely where Gulab Gang fails miserably. Yes, even with two good box office bets of yesteryears – Madhuri Dixit & Juhi Chawla.The script demanded dialogue delivery of typical Hindi belt. If that be the case, then casting Juhi as the villainous politician mouthing lines in desi accent defies all logic. Some Juhi fans will argue that she was a superstar of her time. Well, she was a star who was "part of" quite a few hit films but that doesn't necessarily mean that she was brilliant in all of them. Even when she was in her prime, she was at best above average, never path breaking. She was and will be best known for her liveliness, youthful charm and disarming smile which is why her being cast as a negative character created such a buzz but then as it turned out, the bee just buzzed, it lacked the sting! Juhi's crooked smiles and shifty glances were grossly overdone. She was trying so hard that it hurt. Can't villains and vamps speak normally? It is difficult to comprehend why Juhi was given such rustic dialogues when she was so ill at ease delivering them.Coming to Madhuri Dixit, well, sadly for her fans even she couldn't do much to save her Gang. She too struggled with her vernacular skills albeit lesser than Juhi. Madhuri had the chance to make the most of this opportunity but she faltered. She is also let down by the template of the film. Just because Madhuri's name is synonymous with jhatkas and matkas, does it mean that post every action sequence, a song and dance routine is a must? Needless to say, the ill timed song and dance pieces distract the viewers from the core issue. That the songs were nothing to write home about, is a different story altogether. The action sequences are well shot and some of the one liners are good but does portraying a woman as the protagonist necessarily mean that she copies what a male hero does best which is - utter seeti inducing dialogues and execute slow motion action stunts? In fact, the woman as the Hero can add absolutely new dimensions. Cases in point, Smita Patil in Mirch Masala, Meenakshi Sheshadri in Damini, Tabu in Chandani Bar, Vidya Balan in Kahaani and Madhuri herself in Mrityudand (arguably her best performance) and Lajja.Another thing not understood is why it is a prerequisite even in a movie based on a serious/real topic to cast an actress with a beautiful face (even at the cost of acting). I mean Madhuri is (or was?) a good actress but wouldn't someone like Mita Vashisht with undeniably great acting skills but with unconventional good looks been a better choice? Add to it, her ability to convincingly look and sound rustic and she would have fitted the role to the T. Cutting back to the actual movie, we have Madhuri (although staying in a remote, dusty, nondescript village) appearing on screen, looking as if she has just stepped out of a beauty parlour – flowing hair, tastefully styled and coloured, not to mention the flawless skin and eye makeup. Even the rest of the gang is dressed in designer cut blouses and fashionably pleated saris. And I am sure I espied an exquisitely manicured hand in the background. The only ones looking and sounding somewhere near real are Tannishtha Chatterjee (the talented "Brick Lane" actress), Divya Jagdale and Priyanka Bose. In fact, they are the only ones who manage to hold your attention. The climax seems to have been inspired by Total Siyappa because that is what it is – "totally siyappad!!"A documentary based on the original gang titled GULABI GANG was (thankfully) released prior to this masala version and I have heard that it is extremely hard hitting. So I would say three cheers for Sampat Pal and her gang. As for Madhuri's Gulab Gang, I would say that this GULAB has too many thorns." 
" An amateur and unrealistic gang","Direction of this movie is not good. First shot of most of the scenes revel that what is going to be happen. So, you loose curiosity. There are lots of illogical metaphors too. Idea of women empowerment behind this film is appreciable but the execution is not. I was expecting some realistic approach towards this subject but screenplay is full of fictitious and abrupt scenes. Corrupt politician, corrupt officer, dowry torture, rape, all these are very routine formula and all thee are weaved in a naive way. Dialogues are good at places. In a scene Rajjo addresses an officer as Collector and in the same scene she calls him Bada Babu(Head clerk)!?Even the office shown was not clearly showing that what type of office is it? Few scenes are conceived well but executed below the written one, i.e train scene of taking revenge is good but there was not a single passenger in train, even the characters are not placed well so the drama and humor could come out well. Even framing is not good. They show a ribbon wrapped Motor Cycle in a scene which is prominent but no use of it afterwards. Yes, someone gifts it in a marriage ceremony but that was totally abrupt because both scene do not have any connection. Performance wise Juhi Chawala is out standing. Madhuri Dixit is OK. Two associates of Rajjo, Divya Jagdale as Mahi and Priyanka Bose as Sandhya are fantastic. Tanisha Chatterjee is fine. Music is OK. One song Gun Gun Gagan is good." 
" Juhi Chawla is wicked in an otherwise weak film","Soumik Sen's 'Gulaab Gang' released amidst some controversy especially the lawsuit it faced from real Gulabi Gang leader Sampat Pal. After seeing this mess of a film I completely understand why. Of course, when the lead actress Madhuri Dixit describes it as her 'Dabangg' (another overrated awful movie) one pretty much knows what to expect: that this wouldn't be a film that intends to depict the Gulabi Gang and tell their story but just another meaningless good versus evil 'masala' flick masquerading as something that depicts and supports women's rights. Even the producers shamelessly throw in the disclaimer that the movie is entirely fiction. Okay.There are several songs (ranging from mediocre to awful) and dances. Yes, Madhuri does dance and I doubt she'd ever do a film where she isn't required to dance. After all, she's a much better dancer than actress and here she fails to have an effect. Sen's 'Gulaab Gang' (should have been titled Madhuri's Gang) are all good looking thin women with nice makeup. Occasionally, they swing their hips to music, stand erect looking indifferent or jump around with domestic weapons. Madhuri also gets to do some Kill Bill-Matrix style action sequences (which are mostly shot in slow motion because Bollywood thinks that's cool). Moreover, the references to Madhuri Dixit the star (and her steamy numbers from 80s movies) are painfully evident. This film was supposed to be about the real Gulabi Gang and not Madhuri the hero. But enough on that. Even otherwise, it's all done so over-the-top. A shootout final? Really? Is this 'Sholay'? The sequences of Rajjo's childhood are laughably bad. Alphonse Roy's cinematography is decent but Sen's script and direction are messy. The film lacks a consistent narrative. The tongue in cheek dialogue appears forced at times.The only interesting thing about the movie are the Sumitra's sequences especially those with Rajjo. In fact, the Sumitra character is way more interesting than the formulaic (super?)hero. It makes the viewer wonder about her background, what made her into this ruthless power-craving monster. She's clearly a sociopath who's managed to get away with so much all those years.And of course, Juhi Chawla is transcendent as she steals every scene and is the only reason why the film is even watchable (despite limited screen time). Of the supporting cast Tannishtha Chatterjee and Priyanka Bose stand out. Divya Jagdale is quite loud. Overall, 'Gulaab Gang' is silly. It, very noticeably, tries to milk on Madhuri's former stardom and the growing recognition of the real Gulabi Gang, with it's supposed 'feminist message'. No." 
" A must watch","Nothing like a screen-rippingly pitch-perfect morality tale. Soumik sen casts female protagonists: a vigilante group leader Rajjo and a power-hungry politician Sumitra Devi, as the horn-locking leads and delivers a sucker punch. That it has female leads is sensational only when seen in a narrow context of the stars playing them but their character's causes, aspirations and life-paths are more a product of their personalities. Rajjo's fight for social justice and education is as gender independent as Sumitra's power-trip. It's coincidental that Rajjo's fight rehabilitates more women than men as she is working within a society that heaps double the disadvantages on the females. Just like it's coincidental that Sumitra finds herself working within male-dominated party-offices. Not once did I have to sit through lectures against another gender, and that is the film's first victory. The fight here, for justice and Enlightenment of masses goes beyond gender, as it should be. That Soumik Sen is able to then drop the grid of a massy entertainer on this wonderful post female-empowerment battle of wits and sickles is remarkable. Never does this grid reduce or trivialise the seriousness of the underlying issue, but only scales up the action and renders the vigilante group more intimidating than your standard ground-bound lathi fight. The other frill, the melodic song-breaks, barely last a minute before melting into the background score as the incident-heavy plot progresses. The choreography feels natural and stemming from the camaraderie and everyday work these bunch of self-sufficient ashramites of Rajjo indulge in. There are some other directorial decisions which are masterful: the opening cartoon montage literally spells out the bones of the "story". The point of this movie is both enjoying the how we then see the bones being filled with flesh and blood of this aptly located, arrestingly colour-coded human saga and the message corked within it. Bolstered by a terrific supporting ensemble (Divya Jagdale, Priyanka Bose, a mellow Tannishta Chatterjee, and all the guys) the two leads stand tall and deliver the goods like only they can. Juhi Chawla, cast against type transforms herself into the vile Sumitra Devi, a person who has fashioned herself as the ultimate political scion. Her self-satisfied smug grin at any opportunity to brow-beat and manipulate is as compelling to watch as her intolerance for Rajjo's popularity. Rajjo brings out the worst in her, to the point that she's compelled to smuggle arms for the ultimate face-off and throw her gloved-hand approach she was found carping about for much her screen time. It's a scene seeing her go down and kudos to the director to build her up to be an intimidating adversary with an unpredictable arsenal of "moves". Finally, there is Dixit. Being a hardcore fan, I was left underwhelmed by how emotionally contained and restrained her last two screen characters, in Aaja Nachle and Dedh Ishqiya were. She was beguiling in both, but how I ached to see her bare her fangs a bit. She is again a single crusader here, but Sen lets her rip. She nails those dialogues in close-ups, absolutely convinces in action sequences (who wants to watch a CGI overloaded 300 sequel when you see some awesome, well contextualised wire-fights right here!) but what still haunts me, much after the screening's finished, is how she had completely internalised Rajjo's crusade for education. There is this scene where the masterful camera comes down on her as she reads the approval of the funds and the way she hugs that piece of paper, it just summed everything. Another scene sees the camera slowly moving to her hunched with unwiped tears gleaming on her face and an old man sitting with her. This is after a second murder of one of her adopted girls. She packs in incredible amounts of resilience and is a beautiful amalgamation of the likes of Gandhiji, Tolstoy and the real-life Sampat Pal. In a governance-less land, this story about the reluctant, noble vigilantes with mainstream frills gets under your skin with Dixit as the heart and soul. While self-serious, it never sags, and it's got songs, action and comedy as welcome relief.Finally it's beautiful to see the industrious and the substance-filled real heroes of the world being championed, than the Dons, Gundays, Rowdy rathores, Rajkumars etc that has become the vogue of late. I sat through the end credits silently cheering for those incredible people who bettered not just their lives, but the world around them. It all starts with education." 
" yawn gang....","To rule out one thing upfront - except for the Pink saris there isn't much similar between Gulaab Gang and Sampat Pal's life who has been going all out to oppose the release of this film. That however, is not a good sign for the dramatisation of events in Anubhav Sinha's Gulaab Gang is what takes this film to unfathomable lows of boredom. Rajjo (Madhuri Dixit) is a messiah for unfortunate or suppressed women who not only provides for basic schooling for girls but also runs a gang of pink sari clad women called Gulaab Gang to stand up against the atrocities on downtrodden women. She is a powerful figure in a village called Madhopur where a local politician wants her to lend support to politician Sumitra Devi (Juhi Chawla) who represents all things bad. In a typically hero vs villain plot, the battle begins between the two women, and needless to mention it's the good that wins in the end.Soumik Sen takes a different approach towards addressing women issues in the Indian heartland but in the bid dramatises the plot to make the film appear extremely boring and banal. The movie is highly predictable and borders lunacy, especially in scenes like the one where Rajjo in a bid to run for the cover sprints on an open ground when she knows people out to get her are open firing. Gulaab Gang is caricaturish from the word go. Not only does the movie have set-ish backdrop with raw huts being places in shooting locations instead of real locations but also has characters that are very filmy. So you have pink sari clad rural women with manicured hands, waxed legs, lipstick and kohl in eyes portraying their parts in a flawed manner. Perhaps it is filmmaker's over dramatised attempt to show equality in genders or an idea of showcasing heroism gone wrong, you have Madhuri Dixit in a female Salman Khan manner doing action stunts of beating countless men to pulp or flying in the air. Who would've though actors like Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla would come together for the first time after years for a film as indolently written as this? Both leading ladies appear miscast for a film that requires women who don't get on board with an image that may be far too strong for them to fit into a character that realistic. However, even at that, it's Juhi Chawla who outshines Madhuri in this film. In fact it's quite a tragedy when some of the interesting characters from Rajjo's gang who actually bring some spunk in the sordid tale die much too soon. What's worse throughout the film is the music which keeps interfering for no reason time and again. There are way too many numbers in the movie which is supposed to be hardhitting and it isn't quite a convincing sight to watch a gang leader such as Rajjo break into jigs or croon away to glory. To sum it up, Gulaab Gang is a half baked attempt to present a gritty action drama. A movie which wastes potential of two brilliant actresses." 
" Watch it just for the powerful clashes between a shockingly new Juhi and the stunning Madhuri.","This is one of those 'exception to the rule' films, which still gets rated as an essential watch despite being just average and having many major glitches in its execution to put it honestly. So getting over with its weaker points first, the film's basic plot is now widely known to all after the recent controversy over its title and the court case filed by the original Gulaabi Gang's leader Smt. Sampat Pal. A well made documentary on the amazing social work by this famous women group was released just a few days back. And though the film is not entirely based on the real life facts, still it is quite evident from where the idea has been borrowed for its basic theme.Directed by Soumik Sen, GULAAB GANG is a sheer commercial adaptation of a serious mission wherein the women power is shown in full force with some well directed confrontation and action sequences along with many punchy dialogues. But since the director also had the knowledge of music, so to display it loudly he goes on adding numerous average as well as not-required songs in his narration right from the first few minutes to the last. Also including a clearly forced HOLI song in the final moments, in which Madhuri starts singing and dancing right after a pretty serious sequence in an utterly silly manner. So mainly due to this worst feature of the film (i.e. the songs), GULAAB GANG fails to make that desired impact which could have easily been achieved with just a theme song being played repeatedly.The film begins at a very lazy pace coming to the point after a long introduction and the entertaining tension actually commences, once Juhi Chawla enters the scene with her cunning smile. Later it keeps moving as a bumpy ride with some worth applauding high points coming after regular intervals. However many routine seen before sequences hamper its overall pace post the intermission and then the all hurried up, illogical climax ruins the entire build up quite badly.So then why I am still interested in recommending the film for all the Hindi cinema lovers willing to see something great? The reason is that yes GULAAB GANG turns out to be a clear masala interpretation of a relevant theme as expected, yet it gives you something unique and entertaining in few of its well conceived sequences focusing on the powerful clashes between the two veterans i.e. Juhi Chawla and Madhuri Dixit, executed like never before. Its indeed a treat to watch the stunning Madhuri walking with her solid attitude in slow motion along with the pumping music playing at the back. Plus the pleasantly shocking Juhi replying to Madhuri's every move with just a playful, teasing smile like a typical shrewd politician.In fact here I would like to admit that though the project was widely promoted as a Madhuri Dixit film in its entire promotional campaign and print advertisements. But in reality its Juhi Chawla who makes a more killer impact in her first ever role of a vamp unarguably. Hence as an exciting surprise, here we have the beautiful Juhi in a completely new negative avatar played real well, offering a lot more than the viewer's expectations from the talented actress. In other words, where Madhuri's decent attempt struggles to make an instant connect due to her mixed language (accent) or all meaningless songs (dances), there Juhi takes the full advantage of this unintentional flaw and emerges as a clear winner in this on screen contest evidently.Now if truth be told then the only person responsible for this visible imbalance in the two key portrayals is the music composer residing inside the body of the director only, who forced him to put so many songs & dance numbers into the film, which actually weakened the entire aura around Madhuri's strong character of a revolting lady ultimately. In other words, if only this film was made with just a theme song and stressing more upon the balanced depiction of both the clashing characters thoughtfully, it would have surely become a gem of a trendsetter in all possibilities, as it seems.Technically speaking, GG has a splendid camera-work complementing the enjoyable actions sequences of the film superbly and one really keeps waiting for all the tension filled scenes of Madhuri-Juhi together, eagerly. The novelty of a woman standing against another evil woman, moving away from the routine stuff keeps the interest alive and its truly a treat to watch only for these specific scenes alone as mentioned before. In the supporting acts, Divya Jagdale performs a bit over the top in a forceful mode but both Priyanka Bose and Tannishtha Chatterjee are wonderfully natural. All the men featuring in their various negative roles are fine, especially the one playing the local politician forced to face the cruel humiliation.In short, do give GULAAB GANG a chance, especially for the two veterans clashing with each other like never before and I am sure you would not regret the decision made, celebrating this year's Women's Day with Madhuri and Juhi together." 
" A treat for Madhuri and Juhi fans","After a lot of hype and hoopla, Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla's first film together, Gulaab Gang has finally arrived. To watch the two iconic actresses of the 90s coming together might seem like a dream come true for many, it did that for me at least. Gulaab Gang completely rests on the able shoulders of these two ladies. Madhuri and especially Juhi in her first villainous role have given their career best performances in this film. I was petrified at how well Juhi has succeeded in portraying an out-and-out negative role for the first time in her career. She proves that one does not have to be loud in order to appear menacing. The way she arches her eyebrows and smiles sardonically makes her appear all the more threatening whenever she is about to do something terrible. Her face off scenes with Madhuri, especially the climax scene where only one of them can survive are brilliant. Juhi Chawla takes coldness and villainy to a whole new level in Gulaab Gang. Madhuri does an equally brilliant job as the hardened leader of a girls' gang who is always ready to fight injustice. One of the best scenes of the movie is when Madhuri along with her protégé goes to a college in order to collect funds for a school she is planning to set up for the needy children. The way she asks the students whether they can introduce a course on hunger management for those children who can't afford to eat at all is wonderfully etched. Her action scenes are mind- blowing and she dances and even sings like a dream. However, I feel the script could have been well written as there are several loopholes in the plot. The gang breaking out into a song every now and then does stick out like a sore thumb in an issue-driven film like this and the climax seems too sudden and forceful that the impact could not even be felt. I guess it has to do a lot with the fact that it is Soumik Sen's first directorial venture. He fails to give the movie a more proper climax. I am quite baffled by the mixed reviews that this film got. The film is actually quite entertaining and both Madhuri and Juhi are in their top form here. I guess Sampat Pal disputing that the film is actually based on her life created a lot of bad publicity for the film. Otherwise, it's a brilliantly made film with stellar performances from the two female superstars of Bollywood." 
" Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla shines in this messy political drama.","The early 90's of Bollywood was ruled by gorgeous and talented Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Juhi Chawla,Karisma Kapoor who set the screen on fire with their charisma and versatility in acting. Gulab Gang will blow your mind with powerhouse performance by Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla. Gulab Gang talks about the right of education , freedom , speech of women in the village of UP. Rajjo ( played by Madhuri) leads the gang and fights for crime against women. Her path is vehemently blocked by shrewd and crooked politician ( played by Juhi Chawla). They face-off each other in the battle of guts and glory.As a first time director, Soumik Sen does a decent job of bringing two veterans and extracting extraordinary performance from them. The movie is exceptional in the first half with few moments like introduction scenes of Madhuri and Juhi , confrontation between them and shutting down then entire office of local office are definitely applauding. However, the second half is messed up completely with so many potholes in the script and not so convincing climax as if the director was in hurry to complete the film. Cinematography is outstanding. Art direction is decent. Background score is good. Music is a big letdown. In fact, it was not required at all. Madhuri Dixit outshines as Rajjo. She will remind you of Janki from Lajja where she played similar strong-headed character. She excels in dialogues and is brilliant in the action scenes. You will probably remember Juhi Chawla as chirpy and bubbly next-door-girl characters she played in various film but you will be taken in for surprise as she plays the negative role with aplomb. She emotes expressively through her eyes with devilish charm.Overall, decent flick where Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla shines in this political drama. Good 3/5https://www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk"

" Watch it for the superior women empowerment it covers and terrific performances by Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla!","Although GULAAB GANG raises a strong voice against years of patriarchal pain and suffering -- one might assume it tilts towards art-house cinema -- the fact of the matter is, Soumik presents the classic conflict between good and evil like any other masala film, replete with high-voltage drama, song-and-dance routine and of course, action sequences. On the whole, GULAAB GANG is well-intentioned with several powerful moments, especially towards the second half. The game of power and politics is well captured too. Additionally, the bravura performances of Madhuri and Juhi add immense weightage to the film. Watch it! It should deserve a National or Jury Awards next year!" 
" Gulaab Gang excels as a movie with empowered women in the lead.","Movie is inspired from the life story of Ms. Sampal Lal Devi (original Gulaabi Gang leader - a social worker currently at village Badausa in Banda district of Uttar Pradesh, an ex Big-Boss contestant as well).The movie begins with the narration of Anil Kapoor introducing the Madhopur village and the Gulaabi Gurukul. Lot of social issues faced by rural women are dealt in the movie right from the very beginning of the movie viz. depriving girls of the education rights, domestic violence, rape etc. Madhuri Dixit as Rajjo is running her Gulaabi Gurukul, where she teaches small girls alphabets and also prepares young girls for self-defense wielding lathis. They weave their own pink sarees. The whole 70mm screen turns pink when they move in a group. Certain rare moments with great finesse: to see them fearlessly detaining a corrupt government official within the walls of the office to fetch the electricity connection back in their village; to see wielding lathis and recovering the truck loaded with stolen grains; twisting the hand of the man who physically abused his wife; punishing the guy who raped a young teenage girl let me not reveal the complete list. Juhi Chawla as politician Sumitra Devi, in her very first villainous character is very convincing. She only values power, time and money and is a very self-centered politician. She actually raises a feeling of hatred towards her character in the movie. The supporting cast Divya Jagdale, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Priyanka Bose, Lata S Singh, Vinitha Menon, Rani Patel, Tanvi Rao are all good and convincing as Gulaab Gang members. The director Saumik Sen has portrayed Gulaab gang in an excellent manner. The best catch of the movie is at the end when he sings 'Jai Ho' as a tribute to different empowered women who made difference to the society in their own ways. I wish, Sampat Lal should have also been shown along with them. Music by Saumik Sen is as per the tone of movie. Madhuri Dixit has given voice to a song Rangi Saari Gulaabi.Gulaab Gang, a perfect treat on the eve of International Women's Day." 
" Decent but may not be accurate","When the film was announced it caught my attention as it brought together Juhi and Madhuri who never worked together till date. Also the topic seems bold however the director opts to make it a mix between masala and realism There are too many dance numbers yet the problems and also several dramatic scenes are brilliantly handled, The clash between Juhi and Madhuri is interesting Another problem is that a documentary called Gulaabi Gang was released few weeks before which showed more realistically the story that mars the impact.Direction is decent Music is okay but too many songs and they do look out of placeMadhuri Dixit is fab in the role that demanded an actress, she is superb though her accent may not be 100% but her expressions and acting is spot on Juhi Chawla for the first time in a negative role is simply outstanding, she makes you forget the Juhi we know Divya Jagdale seen in small roles in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam(Ajay's sister) and other films is simply outstanding, Priyanka Bose and others are good" 
" Madhuri acted, emoted, danced, fought, sung - she did everything well in this movie. SALUTE to her !","Madhuri's Gulaab Gang is a film about two key things:1) Women's situation in India and how women can change their fate - through education 2) Good is always > Evil; no matter how 'sexy' doing evil things and saying bad things lookMadhuri Dixit reflected and stood for "Good" and she succeeds in it ! Madhuri acted, emoted, danced, fought, sung - she did everything in this movie. SALUTE to her. No body I mean no body could have done justice to this role in Indian cinema.Her acting will make you cry, feel proud, and also stand up for other women...Gulaab Gang is a great movie, a must watch for every Indian... Go watch it !" 
" The Queen of Indian Celluloid Strikes Back and How ! Madhuri Dixit is a Gift to Cinema and Our Society","Once in a while we get too see a movie where you see female leads dominating the proceedings. But Gulaab Gang is the only movie where one woman - Rajjo, does everything from acting to singing to dancing to fighting...and it is our greatest actress Madhuri Dixit who portrays this role to the T.She stands for good, fights for good and succeeds in being good - it is a classic tale of good vs. bad and one more reminder to all of us that we should always tread on the righteous path.That is the message conveyed by the director and Madhuri proves it once again that there is no other actor that can portray this character with such poise and elegance.Make no mistake, even the supporting cast has done a good job. Dialogues are riveting, action scenes superb and the background score packs the needed punch.Go celebrate this women's day with this noble piece of cinema - Indians need more such cinema once every decade. And let us honor Madhuri Dixit Nene with the utmost recognition for showing the guts to play this role...Pure Respect to you Madhuri ... Keep Rocking !"
