" Truly speaking, this is the WORST film of 2011","I would rather see a VIKRAM BHATT film any day of the week. The direction of the film is horrendous, Atul Kulkarni has a laughable role in it. Why he signed on to this film is a mystery to me. More roles of this sort will possibly finish his career as an actor.Verteran actors: Anupam Kher, Satish Kaushik, Govind Namdeo are not able to save this film. Ila Arun also stars in the film along with Rituparna Sengupta.What surprises me is that the special effects in this film are decent, but there is no suspense, no thrills or scares. If Vikram Bhatt had directed this film, it would have turned out very differently.Plot: The soul of a dead terrorist, who has not been given a proper Muslim burial, possesses the daughter of a man he had ruthlessly killed. The possessed girl writes a message on one of the walls of her house. No one is able to read this message but Peer Jammat Ali Shah Baba, who states that it was written by the terrorist Azaan Khan, whose soul lies in limbo, and cannot find rest until he is forgiven by the family of the man he so brutally killed. He warns them of an impending arrival of a group of terrorists."
