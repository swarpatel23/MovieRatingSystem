" A loud avoidable comedy derived from the director's last hit.","Frankly speaking there is nothing much to write about this rehashed madcap comic movie, which occasionally does make you laugh on some cheap jokes and dialogues. However, addressing the makers, I would like to say that we are all ready to keep our brains at home for good comedy movies and are eager enough to throw away all logics in order to have some good laughing moments in the theater. But at the same time we are also not fools to keep laughing on the same jokes cracked again under a different title. Elaborating on my above statement let me explain the process, how this quick limited budget movie must have been conceived by the makers and the team.Director Sameer Karnik's last movie was a big hit with the three Deols called YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA. If you have watched the film, then you would agree that the first half of the film was pretty weak than its second and the film actually proved a winner after its interval when the Deols meet Anupam Kher and his family in Punjab. So, taking a clue from this universal feedback, director Sameer Karnik thinks of making another quick movie majorly based on the plot used in the second half of YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA which was actually responsible for its runaway success. For this he takes almost the same star-cast featuring Kulraj Randhawa, Anupam Kher, Johny Lever, Mukul Dev and more for his key roles which are almost the same as in YPD with slight changes. Like in the present version Anupam Kher changes from a Punjabi 'Singh' to a Rajathani Royal 'Singh' and Kulraj comes straight from abroad. To add more spice to the Punjabi feel of the film, Sameer adds Om Puri along with Farida Jalal in the character of a Punjabi couple who abuse more and talk less in their local accent. Now for the hero's role since it would have been suicidal to cast (Sameer's favourite) Bobby Deol once again for the same script, therefore Tushar Kapoor is called in to show his comedy skills, which he does quite well. Further, more actors are roped in for contributing their bit in some silly sequences like Anita Raaj, Sushant Singh, Chandrachur Singh, Rahul Singh and Harish who remain completely wasted throughout the film. With everything on the plate, still a SIKH character was missing in the film, which has been a key feature of Sameer's recent movies. In fact he even made SALMAN KHAN portray a SIKH Officers role in his HEROES and then worked with the Deols in 2011. So following the same track of YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA, he makes Tushhar Kapoor enter in the getup of a loud PAPPI SARDAR, exactly like Bobby Deol did in the original. And then the climax is written with a similar vision where all the confusions get cleared after a jumbled action sequence in which even the actors don't know, with whom they are supposed to fight.Coming to the music part, since it was a low budget movie, so an already Hit track is remixed "Chandni O Meri Chandni" and another more than 5 years old readymade Hit Punjabi Pop track "Kangna Tera Ni" (Dr. Zeus) is added into it to woo the Northern belt. But the Cinematography remains the same reminding you of all those funny sequences in the second half of YPD. Here I would also like to mention the avoidable incorporation of "Croma Technique" used for the scenes where Tushhar is talking from abroad, which also gives you the idea of its nature of quick production. Plus exploiting Punjab and the repeated use of DDLJ syndrome in a film script has now crossed the boundary to reach the tag of "Over-Used".In short, the above might have been the recipe of making CHAAR DIN KI CHANDNI in a short span of time in order to encash the already HIT plot of director's last successful venture. The film does have its moments and few enjoyable performances too namely of Tushhar, Kulraj, Anupam Kher and Om Puri, which are capable of making you smile. Yet I really couldn't laugh whole heartedly on all the similar sequences once more in these new settings. But if you don't mind laughing on the same joke again, then the choice is all yours." 
" Dumb, Awful and Unfunny.","Just like I rated, the movie is awful! In the good ol' days, audiences in some places were known to rip cinema seats, and to throw things at the screen if they were offended by the film they were watching. Beware, multiplex owners; that tradition is likely to be revived this week with 'Chaar Din Ki Chandni'. This appalling comedy, directed by Yamla Pagla Deewana's Samir Karnik is possibly the worst film you'll see this year and we're only in March right now. It's a total waste of time. The movie is too long, it seems to never end. Everything that was happening made no sense and was unfunny. I tried to laugh but I couldn't. The songs were also not very entertaining except for one. The movie was not entertaining in any manner. Acting, songs, dialogues, nothing was entertaining. This exhausting film saps you of your energy, and your will to visit the cinema again anytime soon. I felt in some way it was exactly like the movie "Yamla Pagla Deewana". I wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone. If I were to honestly rate it, I would rate it 0/10, not even 1. Chaar Din Ki Chandni is - Two hours and thirty minutes of your life that you're never going to get back again." 
" Not as bad as thought.","I dint even know this movie existed until it was played during a journey in the bus. When I saw Tusshar Kapoor I thought in my mind lets make fun of this movie and enjoy. No wonder this movie flopped, it has every ingredient for a flop movie: 1.)Tusshar Kapoor(that too in lead) 2.)Weak script 3.)No memorable songs(not a big issue though)It doesn't take long to tell a flop movie from other. The first five minutes can tell you(most of the time this has been proved right for me). But the reason it is worthy of writing a review is, its not bad. The moment you drop your expectations to zero, this movie will surprise you in unexpected ways but once you start liking it and your expectations soar, it kicks them to the cold hard ground.You might say why would I watch a movie if I expect nothing from it. Fair enough, but if you find yourself in a situation like mine, where the other option you have apart from viewing the movie is sleeping, you can give it a try, you will be entertained. Otherwise, buying this movie and watching it may disappoint you.The comedy is great it worked for me. I enjoyed the movie. Chandni's father is hilarious. There are many hilarious moments which you would not have expected. Overall a sweet movie nothing more than that." 
" Nice, nice watch","There are two types of movie watches - serious ones where you focus on everything throughout, and fun flicks where you sit back and enjoy. That's the way I classify my experiences and likes.Char Din ki Chandni fell into the second category, and my hopes weren't too high. The past few years have seen the same lot of jokes being rehashed over and over again, the same trashy sequences, non-existent story lines, and the run of the mill Priyadarshan movies - Golmaals, Dhol, Dhamaals, what have you.But as the movie progressed, the watch wasn't really laborious. Yes, some rehashed jokes, but the quantity of 'cheap' jokes a lot lesser than the non-stop farting, 'bajana' statements usually encountered.The acting was EXCELLENT, whether from Mukul Dev, Kher, Puri, Tushar or Randhawa. Nowhere was it overdone. And the satire on Rajasthani royals very actual.Watch this; you don't need to leave you brain behind like for the other trash these days. Come out and forget it.For the sheer pleasure of enjoying the time, I rank this movie an 8 on 10 - yes, a lot higher than for other Bolywood comedy trash." 
" You Can Give It A Try!","On a serious note what I do in order to rate movies is that I start with 5 and then keep deducting as the movie progresses where ever it seems flawed. But the sole purpose of watching movies like Char Din Ki Chandni is to sit back and continuously make fun of the movie and everyone involved with it. I don't even bother to rate them leave alone writing a review. But but but! this time we actually enjoyed the movie. There were a few really unusual things which happened :1. The theatre was housefull, usually we are the only ones watching the movie besides a few couples occupying the corner seats. Wait a minute! they too don't really watch the movie, do they?2. We laughed at something which was meant to be funny, usually the smiles and roars come when something goes terribly wrong and the moments the filmmakers believe to tickle our bones just invite yawns and sighs.So yes director Samir Karnik's Char Din Ki Chandni is a good film even though anyone you'll ask will just say negative things about it which is of course what I too would have done.Review in a while.Kulraj Randhawa ♥ ♥, Tusshar Kapoor :P the only flaw :PMe - 2.5/5Audience- 3/5"
