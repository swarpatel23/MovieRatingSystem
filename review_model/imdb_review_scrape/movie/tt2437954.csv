" Sunny Paaji Zindabad!!!","Singh Saab The Great is a Sunny Deol show all the way!!! But this is no regular masala fare, this film has a high concept, a good message, and family sentiment. While the first half goes by layering the plot , showing some family sentiment, the second half is where the film really roars with, some great action, amazing dialouges and in the climax Sunny Deol takes the film to new heights!!!The films story is very simple,change is needed not revenge. The film tells the tale of an honest collector Saranjit Talwar he gets transferred to new areas all the times because of his honesty.He hates corruption bribes etc. Enter Bhudev Singh a goon politician he runs the sand mafia in the new place Talwar is transfered. They clash, Bhudev poisons Talwars wife's drink at his sisters wedding, she dies and Talwar is sent to jail because Bhudev sends him to jail in a fake corruption charge.In jail he meets his jailer friend who teaches him to forget his revenge India needs his help, its needs change for its betterment. The Jailer then helps Talwar get out of jail he then becomes Singh Saab and he wants to end all corruption in India. Does Singh Saab make a change, does he seek revenge on Bhudev, is what forms the main plot.Acting wise its a Sunny Deol show all the way, he shines as Singh Saab, he delivers powerful dialouges, and fights like never before. The original action hero is in amazing form!!! Other notable acts are of Prakash Raj who is menacing as the villain, Johnny Lever who provides laughter, and Yashpal Sharma who makes a good henchman. Dir Anil Sharma makes a high concept film, his film has a big heart, but the wife and sister scenes in the film don't work. At times there is too much melodrama. The songs also other than the title song are so so and don't make a impact.But Sharma gets saved by Sunny Deol and his amazing dialouges. If only his first half of the film had less melodrama it would be as powerful as the second half. The pace is also slow in the first half, and film could be trimmed by 15-20 min to make more of a impact.Overall the film works because of Sunny Deol, and the great second half, and the pluses out due the minuses. The films also has a lot of Punjabi flavor so if your Punjabi or a fan of Sunny Deol Singh Saab the Great is a must watch. 3.5/5*" 
" The only Masala movie in recent time with novelty in it.......","SINGH SAHEB THE GREAT - Another Masala movie ! Not at all,,,,its not a usual Masala movie use to watch every second week.....Its a movie by Anil Sharma with Sunny Deol in it..... These two have given us , Gadar , The hero and Apne....so we can expect decency in the movie.... The story is totally predictable after watching the trailers,,,,,,Sunny is a wise collector who doesn't do anything wrong so the bad politician keep on transferring him from one place to another with his sister and wife who doesn't complaint ever for this,,,,during this he met with Prakash Raj who is a bad person doing almost every bad thing,,,,when sunny refuses to do what Prakash wants Prakash made his life hell,,,,after some years sunny came back to take revenge but in a different way ,,,,- by changing the society ...... So as a whole we have a story which we usually use to see a lot in 80s ,,,, so u cant expect something extra ordinary from the story ,,,, so everything depends on the screenplay,,,, but the good thing is that 'at least we have a story'...... The character of sunny is a larger then life character,,,,yes in this he doesn't pull off the hand pump like he had done in Gadar but he had turn a four wheeler from front to back..... And let me tell u,,,,Sunny Deol is the only actor in Bollywood whose physic at least make these scenes believable.....even better than Salmaan khan....There is nothing wrong in Sunny's acting in the movie,,,,he fights,,he romance,,he emotes he cries ,,,, everything is perfect..... Urvashi Ratoula as debut actress done a decent job,,,,of coarse miss universe India 2012 really looks beautiful in the movie.... Amrita Rao's character was not much interesting to give attention.. This is Prakash Raj's best performance since Singham,,,,although his character is too similar too Singham .... Johny Lever and Sanjay Mishra will surely make u laugh..... The title track fit nicely in the movie,,,, I personally liked the marriage songs , it is really well choreographed ,, the item song was really irritating,,,,looks much like Bhojpuri item song...... The action scenes are really great,,,,and sunny make them really,,,,more because of his great physic and intensity in his face ,, will be liked a lot by the the single screen audience..... Like what happened with Ramleela in this too the execution was perfect,,,,but due to an too much tried story,,,,it lacks the x factor.... So its a comeback movie for sunny,,,,nothing did anything benchmarking,,,,but didn't disappoints totally.... m giving it 3.25 out of 5 By ANuP APu KuMaR" 
" Not a new concept but direction and Sunny deol both were great","People may think its not a new concept, Sunny is again looking for revenge. But this movies has everything - mas ala, emotions, great acting and dialogue delivery. Some people also comparing this movie with Dabangg and its sequel but its way better than both. This movie has a message, great direction and acting. Movie is original with original work by real actors and director. If Sunny cannot fight with twenty people at a time, then no actor can do that. Sunny brought many awesome movies and never did big campaigns to launch his movies. But now a days who ever can get more publicity on face book or you tube those actors think that they are better than these legends. I must say Sunny is back which we were missing from many years. All the very best team!!" 
" Sincere attempt, great acting, could have been better","Sunny Deol's sincerity- in ample display when he is bashing bad guys to a pulp, or when he is roaring out insults, and Prakash Raj's delicious evil are redeeming factors that somehow elevates Singh Saab The Great from a mediocre revenge saga to a film with some semblance of substance. "Badle se Badlav"As the titular character, he is a tainted collector who tries to overcome his thirst for revenge against his nemesis, Bhoodev Singh, to become an agent of change. Singh Saab is a cross between any of Sunny Deol's past characters in Ghayal, Tridev, Damini or Narasimha (yes, he has been typecast so much!), and something Arvind Kejriwal should have been- leader of a people's movement, not the politician that he turned out to be. But then Kejriwal is subject for another discussion, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgan, Farhan Akhtar be damned, there is none who can play a more authentic Sikh in Bollywood than Sunny. Alternating between genial, loving, bumbling husband and brother, and a fearless leader cum goon-crusher Sunny holds the movie together, despite a weak script and overlong romantic interludes.Singh Saab the Great is a typically jingoistic Anil Sharma movie, but it is no Gadar- you have heard all the quotable dialogs in the trailer. The romantic back-story between a 50 year old Sunny and the 19 year old newcomer Urvashi Rautela is grating. The comedy is mostly out of place, and the music is eminently fast-forward-able. A large chunk of the movie is in Punjabi-cized Hindi so its appeal will be limited to the north of India. But the movie, like Singh Saab himself, has its heart in the right place. Most movies nowadays start well enough but trail off- Singh Saab is the opposite, with a rip-roaring second half more than makes up for the draggy first. There is a social message, and an attempt to champion people-power. Action or melodrama- Sunny shows the young guns how it is done, while Prakash Raj, who is often said the play the same character ie a funny villain, does break character here to portray genuine evil- a man you would love to hate.It is unfortunate and silly that it all ends in a terribly one-sided showdown between Sunny and an army of thugs. I mean silly because a decade back this man destroyed the entire Pakistani army so this fight was a no contest to begin with, and unfortunate because the climax kind of apes other action movies. Having said that, it was better than what I expected, and till the climax, it did come out as a different kind of movie. Worth a watch!" 
" Sunny Deol Doing What He Does Best","In recent years we have seen Sunny Deol in films which haven't been suited for his acting. In the last 5 years he has made films like Fox, Right Yaa Wrong, Yamla Pagla Deewana and Yamla Pagla Deewana 2, and in my opinion the only one really worth watching was YPD, but it wasn't a role in which Sunny Deol excels in. In Singh Saab, we see Sunny Deol in a role reminiscent of his 90's roles. It's full of Sunny Deol style roaring and shouting on top of what I call Sunny Deol action (People flying away with one punch, ripping out posts from the ground) which has in recent years been adapted by all the other actors but we now see Sunny Deol showing them how it's done. A return to real action for Sunny Deol.With a good storyline and great acting this is must see, not just for Sunny Deol fans but also regular cinema goers." 
" Greatest Movie.... much much better than ram-leela type of movies..","Singh Saab is a really great movie. must must watch for everyone. Its much better than ram-Leela, Chennai express type of movies... that teach you nothing... this is a movie from which everybody will actually learn... I like the ending very much... villain is not killed but changed to good human values... i would greatly recommend this movie... learn from this movie... every hero tries to show his prowess with powerful action scenes... this is not what this movie teaches... this movie teaches badlav... which make more sense than badla... really a treat to watch this movie.. all khans are a failure in front of sunny ... u will see a simple sunny with great message... simple living high thinking type" 
" This is for Sunny Deol Fans .............","Go and Watch this movie ....because its the sunny best action movie till date........I don't have words....he is looking awesome in the movie....After Ghayal & Gadar...this is the movie we all r waiting for....Best action Scene as for me:Stopped the running Ford Endeavour SUV by his single hand while saving a life of a child....Go For : 1.Best Action movie by Sunny Deol till date. 2.Very Good End ...a Positive end... 3.Beautiful track songs...specially the main track " singh saab the great" by sonu nigam.From Sam ( Sunny Deol Fan )" 
" Singh Saab-The Great Entertainer!","It was a long time I had seen Sunny Deol in an action drama film, the genre in which he lives up to all the expectations.Really, I had never seen any of his film in theatre and this is the first film and the best action drama film of all time, that not only is great by its title, but also in terms of entertainment. The music is well written and sung,especially the title song and"Daaru band kal se".The performances have been excellent. Anil Sharma has created not the second Gadar,but the first Singh Saab The Great. The action scenes are heart winning and story-its simply inspiring.We all need to understand that such offbeat films offer what is reality we see in the time today and we need not to miss this film, even if one has been to theatre before the release of this film.On the whole, a solid entertainer that entertains till its running time,i.e,150 minutes.A Dhamaal Entertainer!It has Blockbuster written all over it!" 
" Sunny and Anil Sharma Rocks","This is one of the best movies ever made Regarding Mumbai Politics. Anil Sharma does it again. Sunny Deol dialogues are the best as usual. And I believe he should deserve an Award. The problem is that lot of people in Mumbai, won't understand Punjabi and Most of the words are in Punjabi. Urvashi has acted really well. Words said by each actor is true to their character. Songs are not 100% the best but still I believe this year's best Actor award should go to Sunny Paaji. But It"s gonna be a tight fight between Singh Saab, Krissh 3, up coming Dhoom 3 and Chennai Express. I would highly encourage everyone to watch this film and decide it for yourself. This movie is truly against Racism......God bless." 
" "Sunny is back"...a decent flick in these harsh and hard times!","Singh Saab to me was a very decent Sunny Paaji flick that had all the right elements that a typical Bollywood movie must have and not to forget the superb direction by Anil Sharma as he showed some nice stuff by traveling through flashbacks. Sunny comebacks with Singh Saab in his old "desi superman avatar", he hits, he cries, and tries the right things. You may notice a lot of familiar faces that constitute the supporting cast but Urvashi as Minnie was a charm to watch. There are a lot of good dialogs in the movie and a couple of good songs too. The movie raises the same old issues that India still faces but in a bit different manner. Overall it can be your great family weekend. Enjoy! Rating - 8 on 10." 
" Very Good Action entertainer","Singh Saab the great brings back Anil Sharma -Sunny Deol combo after a long hiatus. This is Sunny's real full fledged action film after the 2003 film THE HERO:Love story of a spy. Recently there have been a spate of Dabangg clones and remakes of southern action films. Singh Saab is in a similar mold but has more emotional punch to it with memorable dialogues and more believable stunts due to Sunny Deol.The film tells the story of a honest collector played by action king Sunny Deol. The story is simple with some twists thrown in to make it stand out from the usual stuff. Sunny Deol's entry in the film is something to watch out for. It is a very well shot and memorable sequence. The only comparable introduction scene that comes to mind is Sunny's entry in GHATAK.Sunny Deol personifies real action. When he hits, you know that baddies will stay hit. The punches and stunts he delivers look believable despite the special effects put into them. The dialogues are top grade and I saw many people clapping and whistling spontaneously.Sunny's acting is very good and he makes the proceedings entirely believable. After the dud Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 he is in top form again. The new heroine Urvashi Rautela is pleasant and provides ample eye candy. Amrita Rao was good but her character is not well developed. Prakash Raj has now become the resident villain of most Bollywood action films. He can't match a Balwant Rai(Amrish Puri of Ghayal) or Katya( Danny of Ghatak) but provides a decent challenge to Sunny. Some of their one-on-one scenes have come out real good.Rest of the star cast including the great Johnny Lever don't get much scope. Also it's pleasant to watch Byomkesh Bakshi (Rajat Kapoor) on the big screen.The songs feel good when you watch it with the film. The title track is a standout with Sonu Nigam's voice providing tremendous depth and range to the soundtrack.In the writing department Shaktimaan seems to have borrowed some stuff from GHATAK. The story could have done with more depth and twists. On the whole it is OK.Anil Sharma has done a good job in the direction department. However at 2hr and 30 min the film is a tad long and could have done without couple of songs and more trimming.Overall it is lot better then most films Bollywood produces and takes us back to the time when action reigned supreme. Sunny Deol rocks in this one!!!" 
" Sunny Deol with a bit difference but nothing great","Sunny Deol's fading career got a filip with Gadar in 2001, After the average runner Indian again his films started flopping, Anil Sharma again teamed with him in a debacle THE HERO in 2003, Later in average APNE in 2007. Now they reunite in Singh Saab The Great. The film tries to show Sunny in a character however they don't miss his Dhai Kilo Ka Hath and loud fury. The film starts with showing Sunny as a social reformer in a pagdi then going through flashback where he was an innocent collector who was forced to take bribes by the ever predictable Prakash Raj. The first half resembles any Sunny Deol film from 90s, we have a bubbly heroine who is killed midway, Johny Lever returning to his loud sidekick role, songs and dances. There are few scenes well handled like Sunny throwing Prakash in fire, The scenes where Sunny takes revenge through a movement are well handled, but soon the film gets into predictable badla 80s inspired cinema, and the action scenes are too artificial resembling BIG BROTHER type films, The climax is simply stupidDirection by Anil Sharma is average Music is nothing new Sunny Deol plays his part as usual but his shouting does get to the nerves, he is good in the romantic scenes which are too many sadly and get nerve wrecking. Urvashi in her debut film is okay though she doesn't get much to do Amrita Rao is quite good except her accent, sadly this wont help her fading career Anjali Abrol as Sunny's sister is good, Prakash Raj is getting too repetitive in fact in most of his films after Wanted he has done same act in Bollywood and his act is getting more and more boring. Johny Lever is boring, Manoj Pahwa, Yashpal Sharma are okay Dharmendra and Bobby Deol make predictable appearances" 
" One of the best movie of Sunny Deol","I had high expectations for this movie before its release and it really lived up to it. As far as acting is concerned Prakash Raj is top notch.You will hardly see any movie where an antagonist surpasses the protagonist.The dialogue clash between Prakash Raj and Sunny deol will blow away your mind.I have been a big fan of Prakash Raj since Singham and he is getting more lethal and dangerous with every movie. I liked everything about this movie but my only complaint is its climax. I would have enjoyed more had sunny killed Prakash at the end. Everybody would want to see such a villainous character die at the fag end of the movie.As far as Sunny deol is concerned he once again showed us how great actor he is.His dialogue delivery is mind blowing.Johny Lever has made his presence felt.Anil Sharma's direction is excellent. Overall Singh Saab the great is a treat for the Action movie lovers. It is one of the best movie of Sunny Deol till date and you can't afford to miss it.Strongly Recommended." 
" Yawn.....pass....","This is an action flick through and through, but it gets old watching nothing but anger and fighting every 5 minutes through the whole movie. Sunny Deol and Prakash Raj play their parts well a contrasting good and evil, but that is lost when it's played out over and over. The three leading ladies basically over act killing any hope of at least adding some interesting parts. They just seem to have been added for eye candy. Johnny Lever's and Sanjay Mishra's characters are out of whack and I wasn't sure why there were even in the movie unless someone thought that would be the comical part (they are not most of the time). The music is decent and the dance scenes are good, but they fail to revive the boredom. There is an underlying message, but it seems like it took 2 hrs and 20 minutes to get to it in the end. If all you want is impossible action scenes of super human feats, then maybe it's worth a watch, but if you want an action flick with substance and decent story that helps move things along, then this one will not do." 
" Worst Movie Ever","I always like Sunny Deol movies no matter what the box office performance is, but this one is an exception. This is utterly disgusting and stupid. Worthless action twists, stale storyline. The character is totally stupid and irritating in most part of the film. The movie is not even funny, but absurd. Rest everyone of the actors performed good. Songs are ridiculous, not even a single song is worthy of listening. I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie and watch something else. I watched this on Video on Demand and it was a total waste. Looks like I will have to stop expecting good movies from Sunny Deol." 
" Singh saab the CRAAAAAAP","I just can't believe that i spend my precious 2nhalf hours on this stupid movie. Let be clear I have nothing against Sikh and Singh but if u gonna show their strength and greatness then show in a right way.I u gonna make him walk on the water and fly in the air then up yours i don't like it and accept it. He just can kill 100s of people by hand and can't spin the cars around and etc.The only reason in completed the movie because i wanted to be maximum angry and write the bad review so again Sigh saab the great is the worst movie i have ever seen. I want to see sunny deol in movies like ghatak and jeet etc with acceptable and reasonable story line and direction but this one was blew out of the water. shame shame shame shame shame shame 1/10."
