" One of the best !!!!!!","This is one of the best paranormal thriller films ever made in Bollywood. It's short, fast and thrilling to watch. Nowadays some noteworthy films go unnoticed very often, maybe because of the poor starcast,not so famous makers, etc.Story is about a doctor in UK who goes about trying to find his missing wife, with the help of a sooth sayer, only to come across lots of twists and turns that he never would expect.Shot upto 98% in the locales of UK, this film promises to keep you hooked till the end. The storyline, direction ,music..everything seems to be well tuned.It definitely deserved more attention.Another movie that I'd recommend like this one is Accident on Hill Road." 
" was leaked out online before release","phhir is actually a very good movie. but now a days since the hype that surrounds the release is more important this movie didn't get what it deserved. due to a poor release it suffered. the pair of Rajneesh Duggal and Adah Sharma were seen before in 1920. but in 1920 it was Adah who was the hero, here it is Rajneesh. he is sadly incapable of holding the entire film together. Like critics put, (taran adarsh) the portions featuring Adah are very interesting. sadly she is only a special appearance in the film. but she steers the story every where till you reach an extremely unpredictable climax. the other performances are lack lustre and she comes out being the only character you remember.the London locations are beautifully shot. the costumes are very good. watch the movie only if you are an Adah Sharma fan. spoiler alert : she is not possessed in the film and the film isn't a horror movie" 
" Should have been released directly on Home Video.","The posters of the film read "From the producers of 1920 and Haunted" and they are also designed in such a way that you get an idea that this is another horror movie coming from the same production house which gave us these two HITS. Its good to be associated with some successful projects but its also shameful trying to fool the viewers by giving them a wrong impression of the film in such a way.The reason behind the above statement is that PHHIR is not at all a Horror film as being projected. It has got only one element of "A Telepathic Girl" in its storyline and doesn't have anything else, usually related with the horror genre. In real terms it's a mystery thriller with a slight reference of re-incarnation of the lead pair who meet again after a very childish kind of climax, opening the suspense. So just don't get fooled by its deceiving publicity campaign tried by the producers.Taking its references from "Eyes of Laura Mars" (1978), which has already inspired more than one movie in Bollywood, PHHIR remains a very weak film throughout which neither excites nor impresses even once till its end. The writers are not able to hold your attention at all since their content is all repetitive and boring without anything interesting to offer in the name of suspense. The whole film revolves around a loving husband's search of his beloved wife, who has vanished all of a sudden without any intimation. He is helped by another girl who has got some God-gifted psychic powers, but soon after the introduction of her kidnapping plot, the film loses it all.Director Girish Damija, gets only one thing right in his film and that's the Cinematography. By approving and working on a very old, overseen and flop kind of mystery revealing in the end, the director wastes his own hard work and efforts put into the project, quite amazingly. And when there is nothing in the film to keep you hooked, the performers remain handicapped and fail to make any kind of impact on the viewers. Hence though Rajneesh Duggal and Adah Sharma show big signs of improvement in their respective acts but their sincerity goes in vain. Roshni Chopra playing the vanishing wife is there just like a guest actor, who is only asked to give some glamorous poses in front of the camera, instead of acting.Incidentally this film was leaked over the net in an unmixed format much before its theatrical release, which is indeed a serious matter to be looked into by all the producers of the Industry and I hope it never happens again. But its leaking before the release cannot be given as an excuse for its non performance at the box office, because the film actually hasn't got anything in it to be HIT. And I strongly believe that its makers too knew this bitter truth and that is why they opted for the misguiding way of publicizing it as a Horror flick in order to get some initial audience. However in real terms, this should have been released on the Home Video directly and that should say it all."
