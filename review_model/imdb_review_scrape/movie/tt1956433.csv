" No entertainment only experiment","Movie starts in a very interesting way. One scene where Inspector Satyaprakash (Ashutosh Rana) is showing incense stick (Agarbatti) in his police station, like a typical common man, to the map of his area, the handcuff, arms and by mistake to the wanted list pictures, then tries to correct his mistake is nice one. One dialogue by him "SARKARI SAMPATTI TABHI TAK TUMHARI HAI JAB TAK TUM ISKA ISTEMAL NAHI KARTE " is also very good. I was expecting such type of scenes and dialogues from this political satire movie but became disappointed. Performance wise Ashutosh Rana is impressive. Rajpal Yadav is fair. Director Mr. Rajpal Yadav fails badly to execute an interesting plot. Unnecessary use of camera panning (Turning left right) in scenes irritates a lot. Camera work is bad especially while pans. It is blur and jerky. Directing a play and movie, is different thing. If one wants to adopt a play then he should must watch "WAQT" Starring Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopda and "Oh My God" starring Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal. These two movies are the classic examples of play adaption. Music and lyric are good and according to mood of film. It paces up the movie. Climax is so boring and clumsy that you start praying for end of the movie. Production value is more than it was required. Huge crowd, huge sets, avoidable expensive equipments are not meant for an experimental cinema. After all, it is a boring movie."
