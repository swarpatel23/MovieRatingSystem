" Wonderful and exciting movie","Hate Story is not just an adult movie showcasing soft porn but also has got potential to keep its viewer excited to see what will happen next! Story is good and focuses on women power featuring how life of an ambitious girl changes itself to a dreadful reality made by her choice. It also warns the difference in Business and Revenges. It's a women on top kind of story where there is only a supporting role of a hero. Although the entire plot was displayed in the promos of this movie however the Tremendous art work in the Direction of this movie and a great story line makes its viewer to stay connected till the end. Excellent Camera-work and Nice casting." 
" Insanely Brilliant !!!!","There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the dialogues, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well pictured and the music is electronically haunting. Never, in the run time of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Bollywood, as it is 100 percent the director's vision.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched !" 
" Glad and Surprised to see such a movie from Bollywood","Must watch for those who like to watch something different and unique every time they step into a theater. To be honest i didn't expect a lot from this one, but after coming out of theater i was laughing and was amazed with the performances of each and every character.This movie provides an entirely different aspect of human nature which is not very often depicted in Bollywood.Basically it shows us there is a dark side of every individual; its just one needs that moment to let this cat out of bag.Go and watch Hate Story because it's dark and bitter but yet gripping and you will like it if you are not only an emotional drama lover and like watching different genre." 
" A done to death, flawed Hate Story","When we see the first trailer of Hate Story, we think of an exciting, bold, electrifying story. Of Course, the erotica depicted in the trailer is anything but subtle. So when I saw this movie, I actually expected a decent movie. (I really did not have a reason to because Vivek Agnihotri isn't even a decent story-teller) Still, the trailer made me have slight hope. However, that hope was gone within the first 20 minutes. More on that in a bit, first the synopsis.Kaavya is a young, modern journalist out to find the truth and the truth only. She pulls a sting operation on a corrupt businessman Sidhart Dhanrajgir. "Impressed" with her work, Dhanrajgir offers her a job. Kaavya instantly falls for Sidhart and sleeps with him. A delighted Kaavya is shattered when Sidhart fires her and kicks her out. Kaavya, pregnant with Sidhart's child has a forced abortion done by Sidhart's goons and is left ruined. Kaavya's only objective now is to get revenge and destroy Sidhart.The story seems done to death but even an old story told in a new way can do wonders. (Agneepath being a recent example of such brilliance) Where Hate Story lost me was in the first few reels. Why does Kaavya work for Siddhart if the post has nothing to do with her last job? Money? If so, then why is she shown as this moral and ethical journalist passionate about her job? Why is she throwing all that away for extra cash? Second, how does she fall for Siddhart so fast? I mean, come on! She goes on a holiday with him and ends up sleeping with him right then? Isn't this the same moral journalist? Plus, why is she even interacting with Siddarth after proving that he's a corrupt money-hungry man? All those questions were thrown at me just in the initial reels. Not a good sign. The writing is poor, and takes the audience for granted. We're not idiots.More flaws? Of Course. Why is there so much forced sex? Also, I don't know why Kaavya went to learn "Prostitution" of she really wasn't going to be one. Plus, she slept with the corrupt businessman a week into getting the job - She's got the traits of prostitute in her.The climax is surprising but seems like something we've seen numerous times.The film really doesn't score much on anything besides two things. The slick style of filmmaking and the decent performances.Vikram Bhatt's story is old fashioned and completely flawed. Too many loopholes. Some dialogue is decent, however.The music doesn't offer much.Vivek Agnihotri's direction is okay. Actually one of the better things in this flick. It's stylish.Paoli Dam makes a confident debut. She's actually really good here. She looks good, of course, but there's also a dominant actress in her. Only if her character and script was better. Despite that, she carries this bad film on her shoulders. Gulshan Deviaha is also impressive. He looks awkward in the starting but pulls on his own.Resst of the cast is good too.Overall - A flawed film not worth watching even once." 
" This Movie Has Haunted My Life !!","Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait of organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Vivek Agnihotri was perfect as well.Vivek deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.My rating : 9.5/10, MUST WATCH !!!!" 
" Its an after-effect of 'The Dirty Picture' with a better first half and a horrible second.","To get over with the basic plot of the film first, it is a simple revenge drama where an ambitious girl after being used by a rich entrepreneur strikes back to set the score equal. Now since the plot had nothing new to offer to either the distributors or the viewers so the makers think of the same tried and tested sex formula which recently was accepted well in the huge hit THE DIRTY PICTURE. In fact, it seems that the present HATE STORY is a kind of after-effect of TDP in which the makers solely use the sex angle and few erotic scenes to bring in a particular section of audience, mainly in the single screen theaters and the smaller centers. Luckily the film makes a good impression in its first half and the story progression keeps the viewer hooked as he keeps on expecting something shocking to come any moment (as shown in its promos). But all the expectations raised by its initial hour get shattered by a very vaguely directed second half which has everything over the top accompanied by some bad acting and illogical plots. Actually post intermission the director seems to have kept the craft apart and becomes only interested in adding all the steamy scenes and fiery dialogues for the viewers who have especially visited the theater for the very purpose. And that's where the film gets ruined completely. With a weird kind of writing wherein a famous prostitute gets easily appointed as the board of director of a reputed bank with the interference of an influential Minister, HATE STORY wastes the entire fine build-up made by its first half.Leading the vengeance saga, Paoli coming from Bengali films, makes the most controversial and unconventional debut ever in Hindi films. She is confident to take off every bit of cloth from her body to catch the attention of both the viewers as well as the industry. But other than the skin show she doesn't expose any exceptional talent of hers on the screen. So the present debut can only get her some similar roles and she will have to show the other part of her art in the next film. However she reasonably does well in the first half as the other actors in the cast. But post intermission mediocre acting takes over the film completely and no one is able to make any kind of impact till its strange climax. Interestingly the culmination also reminded me of a similar one, earlier seen in JOHNY GADDAR.Gulshan as the main villain, does well in the first hour but again gives away to a loud act later on. Nikhil the only hopeful and honest character in the film is decent but gets very less mileage in comparison to the rest. Mohan Kapoor is perfect, Bhairavi is hardly there and Iravati is a talent wasted badly. So, Suresh Dubey as the strict industrialist cum father is the one actor who makes his presence felt with his acting.Musically, it has a below average soundtrack with one good (sad) song, which sounds fine while watching the film. Background score keeps moving between decent and loud, whereas its Cinematographer cans all the erotic scenes brightly in an attempt to show it all. In addition the dialogue writer tries everything to make it look (or sound) like a soft-porn with lines such as "Take It, Shake It & Fake It".But here I would like to share, what in my opinion must have been the 'Base Thought' behind making HATE STORY.After knowing about the title, subject & favourable reports of THE DIRTY PICTURE in production in the late 2011, the producer or director must have imagined the great potential it had as a project. So taking a clue from it he must have thought of just one line to visualise this film. And that one line has to be, "Get me a good looking sexy girl who is ready to take off all her clothes on the screen and can sign that clear clause written in the contract about nudity or skin-show"."But what about the story or screenplay?", someone must have questioned. To this the reply must have been "That we can easily write later on as the film will solely run on its seducing erotic scenes and revealing promos." That is how the idea of HATE STORY must have born in the minds of its producer/director as it hugely relies just on the hype created by all its objectionable promos which even have more sexual content than the movie itself. Obviously the censor used their scissors on certain scenes (like the one with the minister). But even before the promos were banned for the TV, they had already gone viral on the net and had given enough publicity to the film reaching its target audience. Another point which proves this fact lies in its questionable script in which a girl who is a trained investigative journalist gets trapped and then sexually traumatised by a rich industrialist. Now this talented educated girl with a good family background, strikes back to take her revenge. But in a hugely absurd manner instead of ruining the guy by working against his whole empire as a hungry detective cum journalist (the job she could have easily gone back to), the silly girl decides to become the most sought after prostitute of the city selling her body to every big shot of the town. Hence is not exactly Cinema but 'A Perfect Product Marketing Plan' executed well in the business of selling movies. And since films are more or less made for earning money, so we have to accept it as a part and parcel of the trade. A part, which sadly remains the most talked about and the shady one." 
" Grandiose, bloody-minded and implacable,","This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. Even if the viewer does not like revenge type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable. The film-making is excellent and very suspenseful at times.Its great if you actually listen and pay attention because the whole time they are building up to the end.It is the most fantastic ending I've seen but watch the movie.Hate Story,for me is more than a movie! Any film that can be watched 250 odd times and still enthrall has to go down as one of the best. Intense, operatic, melodramatic, overblown and frankly insane! More than any other film, it builds momentum from scene to scene, chugging forward from a slow start to climax with perhaps the most memorable ending in Indian cinema history." 
" All Hate, No Story","The female protagonist, played by Paoli Dam, gets bamboozled by a tycoon's son, and it would have been a wonder if she hadn't been. Greedy, simple-minded, over-confident and full of silly attitude, she was a sitting duck for the ordeal that she had to face; such was her stupidity that she also managed to get pregnant (in this day and age!) in just one night of wild abandon. The tycoon's son was ruthless, but not ruthless enough, so she managed to survive the ordeal, and continued to drum up trouble for the bloke all through the film. And that about sums up this 'story'. The film appears to be have been written specifically for Paoli.. there is hardly any frame in which she is not present. The villain (=tycoon's son), played by newcomer, Gulshan Devaiah, is villainous enough. Rest of the cast is inconsequential. There is a lot of unnecessary, jarring background music.. and a lot of unnecessary panning and wide-angle shots of Delhi, and its neighborhood: Gurgaon and Ghaziabad. Are we trying to impress an international audience that we too have high-rises, a metro rail, a dazzling city center (Connaught Place), heritage buildings (India Gate) and ghettos (Chandni Chowk)? Sometimes, the proceedings border on the ridiculous. For example, when our high-profile heroine approaches a high-class prostitute to learn some tips on how to become a high-class prostitute herself. Apparently, the tips are successful, for soon, from penury, our heroine owns a Mercedes and moves into a sprawling, super-deluxe bungalow. Wow!!There is a lot of hate here, but no story. I just hope young, impressionable girls do not take the film's underlying message seriously - that blackmail and prostitution are sure-shot ways of getting rich in the shortest possible time." 
" A Brave Attempt :)","An "erotic thriller" in India, man that's something you do not come across every day. So, Vivek Agnihotri did manage to gather a respectable amount of audience for his latest movie. For me, Hate Story is just about an average movie.The story is all about a cat and mouse chase between the protagonist Kavya Krishna played by Paoli Dam and Siddharth Dhanrajgir played by Gulshan Devaiya. There isn't much other than that.Now, when a director is confident about the script and the overall movie itself it often goes in favour of the film itself. But this same confidence hits it hard when the director becomes so sure about the movie's success that he doesn't put in the desired effort. Unfortunately, Hate Story is about just that.Even in Paoli Dam's case as the vibrant journalist(considering she is one the leading actress in the Bengali film industry) it seems that just because she's showing off her skin and doing bold scenes, she feels that the audience won't care if she hams through most of the scenes and talks in a weird trying to be sensuous kind of voice. I mean I felt so. Honestly, I didn't pay much attention to the music and let me tell you one more thing the PROMO of Hate Story was much more BOLD(if you know what I mean.. hehe) than the whole movie itself. A MAJOR REASON that left me disappointed :P considering that I had to tell my parents I was going for the movie. Plus the word 'Fuck' was used wherever possible which was annoying.Yet,(there's always a 'yet') I can cannot ignore the brave attempt, the good pace and the not so bad concept of the movie. Plus Gulshan Devaiya does a decent job as well. Nikhil Dwivedi is just okay. And Paoli Dam respect 2/5 My advice wait for the director's cut version ;)" 
" Sliver Story.","Originally not being that sure about taking a look at the film,due to it looking like a rather light Erotic Thriller,I started to become very interested in seeing the movie after catching a glimpse of its wonderful poster,and also due to finding out that Vikram Bhatt, (whose terrific Horror Razz was one of my first Bollywood movies) had co-written the screenplay of the film,which would hopefully lead to the movie having an icy Neo-Noir mood and also featuring a strongly charged Erotic atmosphere.The plot:Celebrating with a fellow reporter over having secretly recorded a meeting between a government minister and a businessman,investigating reporter Kaavya Krishna suddenly gets a phone call from the co-owner of the company:Siddharth Dhanrajgir.Telling her that he has perfectly planted a fall guy to take the hit for the company,Siddharth tells Krishna the he is so impressed with her investigating skills that he would like to offer her a high-ranking job at the company.Accepting Dhanrajgir's offer,Kaavya wraps up all of her journalist connections and sets off for the business world.Being taken by Siddharth's charms,Krishna and Dhanrajgir start to become much more then business partners as their relationship begins to get steamy.Heading to the office one day,Krishna is shocked to discover that her key card has been made invalid.Going to Siddharth to find out what is happening to the companies computer system,Kaavya is given the shock of her life when Dhanrajgir points a gun at Krishna and tells her that he is firing,and breaking up with her,due to having got his revenge on Kaavya making the secret recording.Struggleing to deal with the break up,Krishna discovers the next day the she is in fact pregnant.Decideing to tell Siddharth about the pregnancy,Dhanrajgir tells Kaavya that he is happy to hear about the news,and agrees to a meeting so that they can sort out their disagreements.Meeting her love again with arms wide open,Dhanrajgir decides to give Krishna a warm welcome back by having a gang of his interrupt the meeting,and kidnap Kaavya.Waking up in a desert town,Krishna discovers that Siddharth's gang have performed surgery on her which has killed her child and has also made it that she can never conceive again.Furious over how Dhanrajgir has tried to destroy her life,Krishna decides that she will tear Siddharth's beloved company apart,by becoming the city's most powerful prostitute.View on the film:Opening with an intriguing investigating scene,the screenplay by Vikram Bhatt and Rohit Malhotra initially appears to be offering a tantalising mix of murky Neo-Noir lone investigating and taboo-breaking,sensual focused Erotica.Tragicly,from the moment that Krishna accepts Siddharth's offer,Bhatt and Malhotra use the phone call as a starting pistol to take the film completely off the tracks by making the unfolding plot and characters unbelievably stupid.Running for just under 2 and a half hours,Bhatt and Malhotra completely push the opportunity to show Krishna slowly transform into a deadly Femme Fatale to the side,to instead have her go round a continuous,illogical circle of completely forgetting the murky details that she has secretly caught of Siddharth's,to instead act as if he is her high school sweetheart!.While this seems to be designed as a device to "shock" the viewer every time Siddharth turns on her,the only problem of the "shock" is that Siddharth openly turns on Krishna from the very first scene they share,which leads their incredibly badly feeling cheap,tacky and fake for the whole of the running time.Showing a stylish eye early on in the movie with a good use of spilt- screen,and also being backed by Amar Mohile terrific techno score, (easily the films best feature) director Vivek Agnihotri sadly takes the same route in his directing that Bhatt and Malhotra take with the script.Offering the viewer to see the exciting,Neo-Noir underbelly of the city,as Krishna starts her rise to the top of being the city's most powerful prostitute,Agnihotri makes Krishna's journey to the top one that is shockingly short,with Krishna being shown talking to a prostitute for 5 minutes,to in the next scene being one of the city's main power players,despite being shown to have not even done a days "work" to her rise to the top!.Leaving behind the underbelly of the city section of the movie at such a quick pace,which offered the chance to show Krishna go from a dizzy college girl type into an avenging,icy Film Noir dame,Agnirhotri makes the Erotic element of the film one that is completely empty of any sensual atmosphere.For the bedroom scenes between Krishna and Siddharth,Agnihotri decides to shoot in slow- mo,which leads to the scenes being unintentional hilarious,as both actors are shown slowly pulling snarling faces,and Krishna shatters any paternal that was offered in the movie as she is shown shattering a wine bottle as she reaches her "peak" for no logical reason at all." 
" Subject of Revenge depicted freshly","Saw an excellent movie after a long time. Great performances by all the actors, however Gulshan is the best and 2nd is Paoli Dam.The film holds you from beginning to end and twists and turns make it worth watching.Good work from the crew. Fine tuned screenplay. The dialogues are well written and timing is good.Although not meant for young children, this is a great revenge story, wherein you hate all the characters by the end and that is the success of the movie. This is my shortest review on IMDb as this movie doesn't need words, see it to experience it. I'm sure you won't regret." 
" U will hate it from the start","Unlike the usual Bollywood flicks this is more gruesome.Most of Bhatt's movies are based on greed and revenge Hate story is one of them. The casting of the movie is not good. Paoli Dam was not at her best, i mean the movie has many sex scenes but she doesn't fit it. Bhatt should have cast Esha Gupta(Jannat2) for this role because she's HOT. The movie has some eye openers like corruption, scams. I reckon you don't watch this movie with your family because it's "A" rated film. I had more expectations from this film when i seen the banners(Paoli's naked back) but when the seen her face if was like(who made her a heroine). The script is not that bad but not worth a watch. My rating 5/10 1 star for story2 star for actor(Gulshan Devaiah)2 star for the eye openers" 
" Pure thriller","Movie was in the direction of love and then corporate or greed. The male character realistically displayed double roles inside and outside home. Sexuality aside, movie showed the pattern of continuity very well. This movie led a trailer of hate story films for a reason, have to give different actors credit." 
" Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned","This film begins with an investigative journalist by the name of "Kaavya Krishna" (Paoli Dam) and her good friend "Vicky" (Nikhil Dwivedi) capturing incrimating evidence on camera of a high-ranking executive who works for a major corporation there in India. The next morning her article makes the headlines of the news cycle and the person responsible for the running of that company "Siddharth Dhanrajgir" (Gulshan Devaiah) is told by his domineering father, "Kumar Dhanrajgir" (Saurabh Dubey), who owns the business, to clean up the public relations disaster immediately. The problem is, Siddharth is totally incapable of simply correcting the issue at hand and as a result becomes determined to get even with Kaavya at all costs. So, not long afterward, he sets up an appointment with her and offers her a staggering amount of money to intice her to work for him. Thinking that he is on the level she accepts. Eventually, one thing leads to another and she falls in love with him. However, the day after she sleeps with him he abruptly fires her and revels in her humiliation as she is forced out of his office. Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there because a couple of weeks later she discovers that she is pregnant. But when she informs Siddharth of this he not only has her kidnapped and the baby aborted but also has her sterilized as well. And from that point on Kaavya vows to get her revenge upon him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this was a pretty good film for the most part as it had an interesting plot and some good acting from all concerned. Admittedly, there were certain scenes which were completely unrealistic, but even so I enjoyed this movie overall and have rated it accordingly. Above average." 
" Revenge, prostitution, government corruption, and industrial spying in modern India.","Cinematography: 8/10 The camera work varies from just competent to almost glorious.Sound: 4/10 The interjected music routines were more than a bit intrusive, unlikely, and off-putting.Acting: 5/10 This was a mixed bag. Some of the minor players are indifferent. Joy Sengupta was fairly wooden, for instance. Ghishan Deviaiah's Jekyll and Hyde performance was not convincing. On the other hand, Nikhil Dwivedi was fine as Vicky, and Paoli Dam was wonderful as Kavya.Screenplay: 5/10 It is difficult to take this one seriously. That is, did you just do that? Seriously? The plot's twists and turns were frequent and about 50 percent of them were too unlikely to believe. The house of cards the Sid character had constructed was just too unwieldy to hold up to any kind of scrutiny." 
" Hate Story is a good watch with nice story , good performances and decent direction","Hate Story was a complete surprise considering the trailer showed exotic and bold scenes by Paoli Dam, but more than that, it had fine performances by the star cast.Kaavya (Paoli Dam) is a fearless journalist who along with Nikhil (Nikhil Dwedi) performs sting operations. One such operation leads to of exposing of a money deal in India Cementac company which outrages the CEO , Siddhart Dhanrajgir. To avenge his company's bad name , he plans to destroy Kavya by hiring her in his company and pretend to fall in love with her. Kavya falls into his charm and her life soon turns topsy turvy. She becomes pregnant and soon is almost killed by Siddhart's goon. She is cast away from her family and friend except Nikhil who helps her at every step. However , she starts planning to bring down Siddhart and his company and becomes a prostitute.Vivek Agnihotri ( Chocolate) has directed an exotic thriller which raise few bars in terms of erotic scenes and abusive languages used in the film . However , the good part of the film is the storyline and decent direction with fine performances. It keeps you entertained till the end and that is where the film delivers. Coming to the performances, Paoli Dam is the captain of the ship. She has displayed her skin immensely in the flick but more than that it is her performances which should be considered. She is excellent in her debut film and will definitely go long way. Another noted performance comes from Gulshan Devaiah. He was effective in the villainous role.Overall , Hate Story is a good watch with nice story , good performances and decent direction . Good 3.5/5"
