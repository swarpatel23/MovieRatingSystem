" Throw Momma from the Train meets Notting Hill meets Bollywood","SPOILER ALERT'Chalo Isq Ladaaye' is the story of a famous actress Rani and her number one fan Govinda. The two meet each other by chance when Rani in a drunken stupor runs Govinda down with her car. In her drunken state she agrees to killing Govinda's terrorising grandmother if Govinda kills her cheating fiance à la 'Throw Momma from the Train'. Not remembering anything of this she is stunned when her number one fan calls her telling her he has done the deed and now it is her turn. Faced with no other options she and her secretary set off on their mission. Somewhere along the line Rani and Govinda develop feelings for eachother à la Notting Hill.The story is quite funny. And shows that remakes aren't necessarily awful. The actors are very entertaining. Johnny Lever is an idiot as usual and Rani is adorable as usual. And Govinda's dadi is just priceless. She almost makes the principle in 'Mathilda' pale in comparison. The songs are also quite fun. All in all not a bad way to spend 2 1/4 hours.***/5 stars" 
" Chalo Ishq Ladaaye","The movie involves Papu (Govinda), a carefree youth who is constantly pestered by his grandmother (Zohra Segal). Pappu is in love with a cabaret singer, Bobby (Mink Singh) but his dream girl is Bollywood actress Sapna (Rani Mukherjee). As it turns out, Sapna isn't too happy with her rich business magnate boyfriend Rahul (Sanjay Suri) and Pappu doesn't like his grandmother much. So when the two have a chance encounter they strike a deal to murder one another's causes of misery. Since the murderer and victim of each crime would be strangers, there would be no evidence or motive linking anyone to the crimes. Then come the plot twists. Pappu and Sapna grow feelings for one another, and a love triangle brews. And Rahul turns out to have some tricks up his sleeve as well." 
" funny stuff","This film is a copy of throw momma of the train, but its more funnier. I cant really imagine any Hindi actor playing Danny Devitos role. Because it does not suit an Indian actor trying to kill his mum or grandma and at the same time its comedy. Govinda yet does a pretty good job, i can only imagine Akshay Kumar playing this role. Its a hard role to do but Govinda does a good performance. Rani plays Billy Crystals role as the actress and she is AL right. Rani is my favourite actress and god bless her she is wonderful. The film is non stop outrageous but fun comedy. The grandma in the film is so funny Zohra, she is great in her role. The film has the usual Johnny Lever and Kader Khan who are terrific." 
" pale imitation","Why do Hindi cinema makers continue to do this? A Govinda and Rani version of Throw Mama from the Train..Well you know the story - this version is not 1/10 as interesting, and is full of silly situations with Kader Khan as one hit man in Rani's employ. There is even a twist at the end that is even more pathetic. Rani looks cute - I always enjoy Govinda but this was one that I snoozed through and felt that I might have enjoyed my snooze better without the film playing in the background.See it if you must and if you are an avid Rani/Govinds fan - but expect nothing. A silly silly film." 
" If you had a fun-loving Nani or Dadi like the one in this movie, then, its a must watch","I liked this movie coz the Grandmother in this movie had a lot in common with the way my dear nani lived her life(she is no more). So, this movie has a lot of sentimental value but inspite of all that, we being Indians can totally relate to the fact how much our grandparents want us to be good kids, get good jobs and then marry a good boy/girl. But this movie has a twist in the sense that the grandchild wants to kill(not really) his grandmother and loves her deeply within. And in order to achieve his funnily ill-intentions, he makes a deal with an actress. But it all ends up in a laughter riot."
