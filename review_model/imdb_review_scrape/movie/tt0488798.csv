" A fun, good-natured comedy",""Welcome" is a enjoyable, masala comedy with an amusing cast. It has plenty of ridiculously unbelievable, cheesy moments and the film requires viewers who don't take themselves or the movie too seriously, and who know how to suspend their disbelief. Unfortunately, there are plenty of people who are unable to take the movie in the spirit it was made. Is it full of buffoons and a silly plot? Of course! But what makes this movie so charming is that - like plenty of other Bollywood films - it tells its story with such sincere, earnest conviction that you can't help but get sucked in.The story is centered on a mafia family headed by two dons, played by the unfailingly charismatic Feroz Khan and the gifted Nana Patekar. Nana Patekar is trying to find a boy from a nice, decent family to marry his sister, played by Katrina Kaif (surprisingly, she is tolerable in this film). Aiding the don in his quest to find a suitable boy is one of Nana Patekar's lesser dons, played by Anil Kapoor. When they find a suitable boy (Akshay Kumar), things are complicated by the suitable boy's uncle (Paresh Rawal), who is not terribly excited about his nephew marrying into the mafia. And from this tangled web of conflicting goals ensues chaos and mayhem. Mallika Sherawat is also entertaining (if extremely confusing) as a random girl who is...confusing people.It's a silly movie full of childish, mischievous comedy and feel-good moments, but I think that, in the end, that's what we value about Bollywood films: their family-friendly messages, the dazzling spectacle in scene after scene, fun filled madness and a talented cast. Nana Patekar and Paresh Rawal were especially impressive and quite adorable. It was amusing to see Akshay Kumar play a clueless good guy after being so used to seeing him as an action hero.The only way to enjoy this movie is to throw brains and common sense out the window and enjoy it for what it is - a family-friendly comedy with lots of laughs and entertainment. It's a question of expectations. If you get this movie expecting to see something similar to a Hollywood film, then you will disappointed. Bollywood isn't anything like Hollywood, and there is nothing wrong with that. I didn't get this DVD expecting to see an Indian version of The Godfather. There are plenty of funny references to The Godfather in this movie, but the director clearly intends to parody the world and lifestyle of a mafia don, and I think he did a good job. It's a happy story that laughs at itself at every turn, and that's great." 
" The best comedy movie of this year","This film i went especially to see in star city and it definitely was not a waste. This film was brilliant in everything that it had tried to achieve. When i first saw who was in it and the sort of plot line and who is was made by and stuff i thought it would be funny and a good film. When i came out of the screen i had not only confirmed my predictions but realised this was a splitting your sides funny and an excellent film. Katrina Kaif cannot act for dog biscuits and the song Koka Laka Valari was a bit stupid but besides that it was amazing. It was nice to see Malika wearing normal clothes for once and even 2 saris i mean that is brilliant even for her. She looked very nice and that item song by malika arora khan was good and i specially liked the song kiya kiya. Feroz khan was good in this movie and Nana Pateka and Anil Kapoor made me laugh so much. I loved the ending when Lucky jumped out the fire and Akshay Kumar started screaming "Miracle Miracle" lol and when Paresh rawal's wife came and Feroz khan was like wtf is she doing here? and stuff it really was an amazing movie and a brilliant end to the year and start if you saw it after new years." 
" I want to go back in that time.","What a time 2007 was!& right we are lacking for a good comedy movie...& yes Majnu bhai's painting is still famous in market." 
" Welcome to the Different Bollywood Comedy","Welcome takes bollywood's modern movies to a new level. Anees Bazmee comes up with a very well directed comedy unlike his previous and 1 or 2 next ones as well. It is a mixture of a little senseless comedy, great situational comedy and even some intelligent comedy. The movie really builds on its very one-line story. This is because of its characters and the performances of the actors. Nana Patekar has really not given as much to comedy film as he could have given. As Uday Shetty, in his very own style, his expressions and involvement are a toast to watch. He sort of does what I feel Paresh Rawal did in the all-time-great Hera Pheri (Though, he was not as hilarious as Babu Bhaiyya). But I really loved his character. Equally good is Anil Kapoor who himself gives his best ever performance in a comedy movie. Majnoo Bhai is so caring, innocent, dangerous. There is so much liveliness and the "taporiness" in him that whenever he is on screen, you are bound to laugh.Rest of the cast is more supporting to these two. Akshay Kumar very rightly gets a supporting comedy role at which he's very good. He takes care of his comedy and romance scenes well since he doesn't have the burden to run this comedy movie all alone. Katrina Kaif comes up with a good performance which is really charming. She really became comfortable with the guidance of many veteran actors. Paresh Rawal gets a chance to show that he knows the art of comedy even in a different style. Dr. Ghoongroo does give you the laughs in his not very much screen time. Then there also is Feroz Khan who comes and gives a direction to a movie and really holds it till the end. The only problem with this other cast is they make you smile but not really laugh. Else, Sherveer Vakil, Mallika Sheravat, are good.Lastly, to generate more, this movie finds a place in an ever welcoming story that could get many more characters. Other actors like Asrani, Mahesh Mishra and all the little goons, the film-making crew are all enjoyable and have the punches. These people have some punches delivered very well.It is a treat to watch a bollywood movie with such a good level of situational comedy and the sort of creation of comedy (Uday's horses and onions). I may be crazy in watching this movie more than 10 times but every time it makes me laugh. You just need the right sense to see it.See this movie for its performances and the comedy that really comes out of nowhere. The lack of story never really becomes a problem, he only real problem in this movie was the music in which "Hoonth Rasiley" was bad while the others okay and one like "Kiya Kiya" fairly decent.WELCOME is a treat to watch. You will come out of the theater saying that it was a very good movie but only if some of the scenes were given a try to be made hilarious, it could have been much much better. (the one rating missing due to that)." 
" Still enjoyable","This movie was so entertaining but it's really enjoyable at any point Akshay Kumar was funny Katrina was superb ANIL was superb paresh was brilliant comedian Malika is superb NANA was a great performer Songs are really impressive My rating is 7/10Enjoy this with family" 
" Depends on how you look at it...","What can I say about "Welcome!" ( I added the exclamation mark at the end because it fit so well) other than the fact that it rocked my socks off. It was hilarious, and yes, silly hilarious. Yet I know that it would not have been so entertaining if it weren't for the brilliant actors (Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar were amazing) and pretty good songs. Anyways, it would take a lot of talent to explain the plot to anyone because it's one of those chaotic slapstick comedies that you just have to check out for yourself, and only watch once. But in a nutshell, it is about this really decent man (Paresh Rawal tearing it up as the timid doctor) that would like his decent nephew, Rajiv (Akshay Kumar) to get married. Now comes in the hot Katrina Keif (who cares what her name was?) who, after a medley of hilarious situations, falls in love with Rajiv. There's only one problem with this, her brothers are big shots in the underworldand are not very modest. "Welcome" is welcoming if you allow yourself to be invited. Don't go watching it with expectations that it will be the cleverest and most sophisticated movie you will seeand when it's not, don't restrict yourself from laughing away to glory" 
" Patchwork","The movie is nothing more than it promises to be...a series of jokes tied loosely together. Although some of the jokes are old and repetitive, watching actors like Paresh Rawal (character borrowed from Albert Brooks in the Michael Douglas starer 'The In-laws'), Akshay Kumar (character borrowed from Hugh Grant in 'Mickey Blue Eyes'), Anil Kapoor & Nana Patekar get their comic timing right is priceless. Anil Kapoor proves once again what he did in Janbaaz and Trimurti: he is definitely one of the best on-screen bad boys of Bollywood.Katrina and Mallika both look stunning, which perfectly and exactly serves their purpose in the film. Watch it only for the above listed reasons and none other." 
" A comic of jokes edited together and gains momentum in the second half.","The latest in the inspired comedy series is this laugh riot which is full of stars. The basic plot is inspired from the Hugh Grant movie "Mickey Blue Eyes" (1999). Even the hero's profession is kept same as an art house auctioneer. But then the script takes on indianized plots and tries to make you laugh through comic sequences. No doubt the promotional packaging was superb which surely gave the movie a big initial draw at the cinema houses. But the content is rather not impressive and its like several comedy sequences joined together. The focus of the screenplay keeps shifting from one plot to another. The biggest disappointment is that it has less of Akshay and the viewer keeps waiting for the scenes with his brilliant timing. There is more of Anil Kapoor & Nana Patekar as two dons. Nana is kind of same with his expected mannerisms but Anil is superb and acts like he is enjoying every minute of his act. He even looks a lot younger than his age. Feroz Khan looks graceful but is loud at some scenes. He has more scenes in the climax of the movie and is also introduced after the interval. The heroines are only there for the glamour quotient of the movie and could not ask for more in this heavy star cast movie. The first half of the movie has many unwanted sequences which are only inserted to create laughter and have nothing to do with the screenplay. But the film gains momentum in the second half when Vijay Raaz enters as a phony film director. In fact in my opinion this plot of making Nana an actor in a fake film should have been the highlight of the movie, which could create more laughter's in the cinema. The songs are all inserted as usual and only few are hummable. The best part of the movie comes towards the climax after Katrina accidentally shoots the son of Feroz Khan. The chase and the play with the dead body afterwards is surely hilarious. It is the main highlight of the movie as you get to see some quality comedy scenes and timing in this. In all the film is not as expected but still will brings audiences to the cinemas due to the superb promotional packaging, immensely popular catchy title song "Welcome" and due to the current hot thing in Bollywood – Akshay Kumar." 
" One of the best comedy.","Still it is more enjoyable than any of nowadays comedy movies.Simply love it." 
" Best comic film in Bollywood","One of the best comedy film of Bollywood. Paresh, Nana and Anil are hilarious. So are Majnu Bhai's goons. Akshay Kumar is in a serious character in the film and looks charming throughout the film. Akshay-Katrina prove that they are one of the best on-screen pair in Bollywood and certainly best of that decade." 
" A perfect entertainer even after a decade","After more than a decade since its release, I am writing this review after seeing it for like the 3rd time. The movie has been the source of several memes in the last couple of years including the iconic "Alu lelo0O, kande lelo0O", "mirakal, mirakal" among few others. There is hardly any 10 min stretch in the movie that won't make you laugh or admire the creativity and sarcasm of the writer/director. The characters of Udai, Majnu and Ghungroo will always stay in our funny memories. Akshay does a decent role, and Katrina, with her beauty, pulls off another one with the Khiladi. It is one perfect movie to watch with college friends, or family members. All the songs are still pleasant to hear, make your feet move, all while keeping the humor level decently high. If you haven't watched it, you're missing some original comedy." 
" Neither Mahesh Manjhrekar Nor Mahesh Mishra","A user pointed out that the role of the 'pandit' is played by Mahesh Mishra. As per the user, earlier this had been wrongly credited as Mahesh Manjhrekar. The latter is indeed the famous producer, director and actor, who had directed the Sanjay Dutt starrer Vaastav. Now, coming back to the artist playing the 'pandit' role in Welcome, he is not Mahesh Mishra as pointed out by the user and as added in the cast list. He is in fact Sanjay Mishra, the comedian who played in films like Bunty Aur Babli, One Two Three (Pintos), Golmaal Returns (Subodh SMS), Apna Sapna Money Money (Pandit Sarju Maharaj), Aloo Chaat (Chhadaami Mama) etc.. So moderators please verify and rectify the error." 
" Not the brightest crayon in the box","With the success of No Entry, the stakes are raised for Anees Bazmee. And does he live up to it? Here is your opportunity to be the judge.Story:: There is none.Music:: Disappoints big time.Starcast:: It would be a gross understatement to say that they have been wasted.Characterisation:: There is no such word in the dictionary.Comedy:: The comic portions of No Entry were a laugh-riot but in welcome it falters big time.Sublime message:: Criticising the people on the other side of the fence, leaves a bad taste.Verdict:: Don't be fooled by the reviews, "Mindless comedy" and "Leave your brains at home" are the camouflaging phrases used by the critics.PS:: Akshay's recent success streak will give this movie a home-run though." 
" Funny ...Very Funny !","Welcome is a great movie . Akkshay Kumar and Co. manage to keep u in splits throughout .Katrina Kaif is looking as gorgeous as usual.Paresh Rawal fits his role to perfection.Nana Patekar is shown in a different role and does it amazingly.Anil Kapoor does manage to overact but is still funny sometimes.The other side actors also do their job pretty well.Forgot to comment on Mallika ....but she doesn't do much and was not really impressed by her acting.Special mention to a one legged guy in the movie...don't know his name but you will find out when you watch the movie.The first half keeps you entertained.In the second half you wonder whereas they are going over the line with the comedy thing.If you really want to have fun in this movie don't think much while watching it.To sum it up ...Go Watch Welcome !" 
" Superhit","Superhit movie, best dialogues, nice story. From starting to end there is comedy in every scene. Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar roles are the highlight of the movie. Treat to watch!" 
" greatest cinematic debut of all time","The greatest cinematic debut of all time since the camera was invented. perfection and nothing less. This movie takes elements from charlie chaplin, pulp fiction, the godfather, casablanca to create the masterpiece metaphorical genius that is welcome. Truly quality work well worth your time."
