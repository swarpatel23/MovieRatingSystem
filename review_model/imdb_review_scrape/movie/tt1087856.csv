" say hello hello hello","OK... let me start off by saying HATS OFF Mr Atul Agnihotri and Chetan Bhagat!!! YOU ARE GR8!!! Now for the rest. VERY IMPRESSIVE! Sohail Khan has left me stunned.Esha Koppikhar has improved her performance a hundredfold since her film Kyaa Kool Hai Hum. Gul Panag was brilliant! Last i was her in the film Dor , and I never expected she was so good! Sharaat Saxena unexpectedly looks gr8 in his small role. The other characters life Amrita Arrora and Sharman Joshi also gave a decent performance! The story is simple. The name says it all - Hello is about life of six people working in a call center.. and how their life takes a u turn when they receive a phone call from God.The climax is like many other films, but in a very unique manner! the film keeps you involved till the end. The characters successfully cast a charm on you and you can actually feel as they do. Some parts will really make you smile and laugh, while others will make you feel great.The music also adds to the fun, friendship, and fun. The touchy script succeeds, cinematography and editing is good, choreography pretty good, and, all-in-all, one must- watch performance. A great start for Chetan Bhagat and a great No. 2 for Atul Agnihotri. Way to go Atul, Your amazing!Easily an 8/10. Go for it!And I assure you, there's no heavy display of sad emotions. So you won't be crying at any point of time!" 
" Wrong Number!","Is Atul Agnihotri a worse director than actor? Well that's a discussion not worth having. His debut film ripped off 'Return To Me' and it was a pathetic movie. This film is pretty bad (though not as bad as other disasters of the year such as 'Drona', 'Krazzy 4' etc) and the worst thing about both of Agnihotri's films is the direction. The guy should have given up after his first attempt and perhaps do something not-related to cinema (perhaps follow the footsteps of another non-talented ex actress like Twinkle Khanna who has now become an interior decorator).I haven't read Bhagat's book but what convinced me to give this movie a chance were Isha Koppikar and Gul Panag. The movie really drags at several sequences and the dialogues are stale. The romantic scenes are corny and dull e.g. Priyanka proposing to Shyam. The songs are irritating and of the fast-forward quality. The characters are not well-developed and as a consequence, some of the performances suffer. The entire God sequence appears forced and ridiculous and the Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif track are cringe-inducing. The film is offensive to non-Indians and there is even a forced 'patriotic scene' about how Westerners use Indians and then treat them like nothing etc etc. The resolution is presented in an amateur way.'Hello' is carried by Sharman Joshi and the actor does a fairly adequate job. Sohail Khan is mostly annoying but there are a few scenes where he displays signs of good acting. Amrita Arora shows some improvement in acting as she's cast against type. Sharat Saxena too is good. Anusha Dhandekar makes a funny appearance as the bimbo girlfriend. Salman Khan's scenes are puke-inducing. He looks and acts like a 50 year old haggard has-been retarded popstar (who has gone under the knife and thinks he's 20 and cool). His fake hair and age are oozing out of the implants and, as always, he's stripping again (ghastly!). Katrina Kaif has never been able to act and she is laughable (unintentionally of course). A gorgeous Isha Koppikar and a sensual Gul Panag are sufficient (but this is far from their best works). The rest of the cast are truly abysmal (especially that office rapper) There are a few funny moments and I liked the chemistry between the five main actors. But, overall, it's a very weak film. Atul Agnihotri should give up on cinema (and so should Salman). Perhaps one can give it a go if they are fans of the actors but otherwise, there isn't much to miss." 
" A Hit book doesn't guarantee a Hit movie....","Based on a bestseller "One Night at a Call Center" by Chetan Bhagat, the movie is a good example which teaches that we need to do a lot of changes and additions on the scripting stage if we want to make a movie on a novel. In "Hello", the director has made some additions, but the add on's are there only to sell the movie and grab attention of the audiences. By only taking Salman Khan for few scenes and shooting a catchy number with shirtless Salman, does not mean that you can ignore the other important aspects of movie making. Sadly "Hello" becomes the culprit of the same thought.Last week, I noticed and mention it for "Kidnap" and this week we have the same drastic mistake repeated in "Hello". I cannot simply understand that "How can a movie start straight away with a four-five minute song?" As the viewer excitedly sits to watch the movie, he is simply served a song at the start. This is a definite indication that you are going to watch a mediocre product. And as the time passes, you know that the outcome is not what you were expecting.An interesting and novel idea gets spoiled with a very poor script and execution. It was hugely promoted as a movie in which a phone call is made by "The God" himself to some call center employees. And the greatest flaw of the movie is that the phone call comes after almost half the movie is over. You keep on waiting for that but the director, Atul Agnihotri is more engrossed in giving scenes to all his characters and in describing the tragedies they are facing. Suddenly the phone call sequence comes and also finishes off in minutes. You don't feel excited while the call is being attended by the characters on the screen. The scene is not capable of generating any extraordinary thrill in the viewer. And as the "Call from the God" sequence ends, you also end having any interest in the movie. Morevoer, you also don't find any great results in the movie, even after the God has called.Performance by the entire cast is simply professional like they are just doing another film. So nothing special is there to write about any specific actor. Only Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif seem to be more interested in contributing to the movie than all others. They both are there enacting "a special appearance" in order to provide a star element to the movie. A catchy title song with Salman, is good to watch, but it should have been there in the end titles instead. The special and heartily efforts of Salman & Katrina are not able to save the movie which is unexpectedly a poor product based on a best-selling novel.It's nice to see that we are again picking up good books and novels for the stories in our movies. This practice was done way back in the Black and White era and in later years too by some great film-makers India has seen. But in the current and fast changing times a lot has to be re-shaped and re-written to transform a successful book into a Hit movie. Unfortunately, "Hello", fails in doing that." 
" Too bad to make a movie!!! and please stop degrading Americans!!!","I don't know from where director took this story. There is noting in the movie except the message which the actors get from the god. I guess the director can make the movie more better and can add the message in it.The thing which I don't like about the movie is degrading Americans and telling that they are dumb... I think the director forget the fact that Computers are designed and developed by Americans and there are many genius people in America as well as in India..Many times while watching the movie I felt that there are many scenes which are unnecessary in the movie..And overall this movie is Awful!!!" 
" Hello is a well made film","This was one movie that I was waiting for very eagerly! Carry a pack of pop corn and cans of cold drink and enjoy this film with friends ,it has everything , starting from bang bang song( super six pack Salman dance number) , humor , sympathy , thrill , romance , revenge and what not and not to mention director Atul Agnihotri was the captain of all these departments . Out of so many positive things the most important thing is the story line, which is very gripping and entertaining....Salman's hard work on his body paid off , he really danced well on the song bang bang which has good production values....The Picturisation and the music was excellent...Their something happening in every scene of the movie and you don't get bored or look at your watch, script is strong. Performances are strong too....Though the film was based on the novel one night @ the call center and people knew about the plot still it was enjoyableIn a nutshell its a books idea; Bollywood Masala filmI am giving Hello 9/10" 
" Do Not Miss This One!,","After a long and tedious wait Hello arrived. There was a lot of skepticism about how it would be since its based on the best selling novel "one night@ the call center". However when one enters the movie theater, those factors are hardly on one's mind. And any thought of all those things indeed vanished from my head the moment the movie started.Hello is one of the best films to have come out of the Bollywood stable in recent years. And to top it all, it has a nice dose of humor as well. All thanks to its director Atul Agnihotri and story writer Chetan Bhagat ...the life in a call center is shot simply beautifully .... The acting by Sharman Joshi and Sohail Khan is superb to say the least. Gul Penag and Esha Koppikhar is absolutely brilliant and Amrita Arrora as Radhika leaves a lasting impression. And finally, Salman Khan. yeah this guy is simply brilliant...the bang bang song is totally worth all your money...Salman and Katrina look too good together...Watch this movie for its complexity and its simplicity. What an amazing way of making the year so special!" 
" Bye Bye","Based on the book called One night at the call centre, the film centres on the events that happen to an eclectic array of characters over one night at an Indian call centre. I've not read the book but the movie is absolutely atrocious. The rubbish drama was so boring that I had a sore head & I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. There were no different events and situations and was far from entertaining & beyond boring. At the start Salman's character was not told that who is he but instead they put a stupid song Bang Bang.Then out of nowhere Katrina Kaif came and was telling him the outrageously boring story and she is completely crap. Neither she knows acting, language (her voice is always dubbed for her), dance and always fails to impress. I do not like her one bit and its better off that she is kicked out of Bollywood and never comes back again. Even all of her movies suck (except Race). In the story the Americans where calling the Indian call centre to get help and the film was showing that the Americans were stupid and Indians are smart (I mean how daft a film can get??). If I was in Salman's place then I would've ran away as soon as I can and said "Bye Bye" instead of Hello.I was more interested in the film's ending not because the twist or anything would be revealed in the last reel but because it would mean the end of discomfiture." 
" Loyal to the Novel, lacks the spark","Hello, the movie, is loyal to its source 'One Night@ Call Center". Thats where the issue lies. Let me explain. Hello is the story of 3 Men and 3 Women working at a call center, their lives, their work and above all their relationships. Without dwelling much into the very well known and popular story I can safely say that the story is very loyal to its source. Its so loyal that it forgets that reading a piece of Literature and watching the same thing on-screen are two completely different experience. The Novel is so popular that most Indians are very familiar with the story and how it ends. When they go to watch the same thing on-screen it becomes very predictable. It actually becomes boring to he movie-goer even though the acting and the character developments are well enough to match the novel. But then again, when filming a novel of such popularity a direction just would not dare to twist the story to an extent where the original becomes separable from its copy on celluloid. So, if you have read the novel, you have seen the film too. Regarding the acting, the only thing awful in this movie is Mr. Khan. He should stop playing characters which are suitable for actors 20 years younger than him. Specially 'paired' with an actress as young and beautiful as Ms. Kaif. One of the comments on IMDb objects to the movie calling Americans Dumb. Agreed, they are definitely not. But it is a well known fact that in call centers in India the '35=10' rule is followed. It is to ensure that no agent is rude to the 'general' customers (who are, in most cases, 'relatively dumb', regardless of which country they belong to) and not to poke fun at any country. Also, racist calls are rampant in call centers. In all call centers. Not just those serving US clients/customers. Overall - 7/10. Strong recommendation: Set your expectations right before you see this movie IF you have read the book." 
" Very highly Recommended!!","I saw this film tonight in London and the theatre was packed. Within the first 30 minutes I could understand why. What a wonderful Indian film after a long long time!! Very well made. Very punchy, funny and realistic. Good performances by everyone especially Sharman Joshi and Sohail Khan. The character casting is excellent. Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif in a cameo are great. One of the rare Indian productions where the jokes were effortlessly funny. Music is great and so are the songs. Songs are panned out well and do not stand out as in most other Indian films. Song likes Rab Ka Banda, Karle Baby Dance Wance are really well shot...Rab Ka Banda actually makes one speechless.... Very touching and refreshing film. Very highly Recommended!!" 
" Surprisingly good......","None from my family were that keen about this film. I myself preferred watching a movie directed by Sanjay Gadvi instead of this and didn't pay much heed to this film.I was taken aback after my friends saw it and told me that its a must watch and then, my family decided to watch this movie on the big screen. I yet was ambivalent whether it would live up to my expectations, after watching preposterously bad films like Drona, Kidnap etc. I myself admit that I am harsh as a critic and most of my reviews, whether Bollywood or Hollywood, are somewhat criticizing the film in some or the other way. I never go with very high expectations just as a 'normal person', without any feelings to review my feelings after watching the movie and after I left the theater, I was happy and that meant, that the movie was good. I am afraid that I might give away some important details of the movie deliberately; therefore, I am not going into the story details. I will first mention the points that I liked in the movie:1) The performances of all the characters were strong. Especially Sharman Joshi,Gul Panag,Sohail Khan and Amrita Arora. Salman Khan played his role very well and looked very handsome.2) The humor was good in this film. Sohail Khan has good comedy timing while Sharmans expressions just makes anyone laugh, especially in the first half. I even liked the character of small Sharman called as Devil... he was really funny and it was humorous to watch him get agitated by you'll know when you watch the movie.3) The first half was really good, witty and humorous as the audience didn't get bored or didn't feel to leave their seats. 4) The songs were a mixture of catchy and melodious. 'Bang Bang Bang' and 'Hello Hello Hello' were really good songs while the others too were decent. 5) The camera effects were amazing and I felt that the editing was good. Now, in one paragraph, I will explain the flaws in this movie. i thought it was little short... Overall, it was a relief to watch this movie as I was relieved from a state of shock after watching the abominable film Drona. But I didn't feel that I could watch it for the second tome immediately after leaving the theater and even after a few days after watching the film.8 out of 10." 
" a must see movie","The movie is totally a must see.It is a perfect Diwali treat.The direction is excellent.The script is outstanding.The movie tells us about six people working in a call center. It is a tale about the events that happen one night at a call center. Told through the views of the protagonist, Shyam, it is a story of almost lost love, thwarted ambitions, absence of family affection, pressures of a patriarchal set up, and the work environment of a Globalized office. Shyam is losing his girl friend because his career is going nowhere as he trudges his way around in a call center. His girl friend, Priyanka, is also an agent like him at the call center who is about to be snatched by an NRI Technogeek. There is also the aspiring model, Esha, who is hoping for the break that seems to be always already eluding her and the man about town, Vroom, who is into well, things. The housewife, Radhika, who is constantly at the receiving end of her mother-in-law and a beleaguered grandfather, Military Uncle, who has been barred from interacting with his grandchild make up the rest of the call agents who see their worlds crumbling around them as the decisions of right sizing are conveyed by Bakshi, the boss.The movie is a must see.Sharman and Sohail were superb.The others are superb too.The music is excellent.This movie will keep you totally entertained from start to finish.This movie is 100%Family Entertainer.This is much much better than "Kidnap". A must see movie Rating-10/10" 
" 'Hello' , we are totally entertained....","If a director has courage and the guts to take an outdated story line and execute it to a perfection that is altogether to a new height; new level, the director seriously has got some talent. If you ask me a good/talented director is all you need to get the best out of everything; be it a story line, situation or performers. Same situation same actors has brought such a new , absolute fresh piece of cinema, which probably would have been another needle in the hack had it been directed by any run of the mill director. The store line is about six characters working in a call center and how they manage to make their life great. The dialogs are sparkling despite being mature. The funny moments are truly funny and emotions look absolute real. U immediately relate to them. Over all the chemistry Atul Agnihotri (who directed Dil Ne Jise Aapna Kahan) manages to built between the lead characters is stunning, absolute real, natural and believable, I have not seen (and I am sure people would agree) such a sweet and heart warming chemistry in any romantic couple for a Long time (Sharman Joshi and Gul Panag). Music is good as well with 2 absolutely amazing songs........"Bang Bang Bang" and "Rab Ka Banda". People specially couples whose heart throb with a universal feeling called love go and watch the movie, you would come out mesmerized by the romantic extravaganza between Sharman Joshi and Gul Panag.......trust me.The Direction is in accord with the screenplay, the narration being consistent and coherent all the time.The best part of the movie is the light background which makes the love story go ticking, with every character in his own slot.A good movie for a fun filled evening!" 
" Atul Agnihotri is a burden to Bollywood","Man this Atul Agnihotri could never be a great actor and now he tried directing films, to give competition to Deepak Tijori another same typeIn This film he takes his brother in laws Salman and Sohail Khan with Arbaaz Khan, Amrita Arora too and then he takes the talented Sharman Joshi and Gul PanagMakes a joke of the book by Chetan Bhagat ONE NIGHT AT A CALL CENTREWell what else we expect with such a cast and such a director?The first song and scene involving Salman are enough to give u a headache and the way the call center is shown, it's even worsePerformances are OK Sharman is the only actor who acts well, even if the script is bad Sohail is irritating as ever, god please, he should leave Bollywood Arbaaz too is similar Salman should stop trying to look cool and young, looks like a drunkard Amrita Arora is better, Gul Panag is good while Katrina Kaif continues to act fake" 
" another Indian disaster","basic concept is 6 call center employees got a phone call one night.this is not a ordinary call it's from god..now why god call him?..what he told him?..does it change their life or not?..thats a plot of movie.Concept is nice...but unnecessary inserted songs and very unnatural acting makes one of the worst movie of Indian film history..Salmon khan and Katrina made a special appearance. Salmon khan is himself and Katrina told a story to Salmon while Salmon have to wait in waiting room for 2 hours until a chopper get repaired.film describes the back-story of each character until interval...and at the end no impact remains on audience mind at all." 
" hello movie","i think that the promos made the movie look a little more mysterious and exciting then it actually was. It takes a little while to actually get the movie started and i feel they could have done a little better.Also, they could have had some more parts to do with salman khan and katrina kaif as they were hardly in the movie. The setting of the movie is pretty good however, thescript was a little weak. There is a short song in this movie which goes something like this "When you love me it feels so right only in your arms tonight I wanna feel you next to me holding me so tight love me love hold me hold me" does anyone know the artist of that song or the name of the song or is just another part of the movie?" 
" Awful, boring & Worst film I've seen in years","I wish i can give this film a big zero if IMDb allowed me to and if they had the option. Let me briefly tell you what this film is all about and you tell me if this film is good. Its about Salman Khan who sits down in a lounge after doing a concert and suddenly Katrina comes in. She mysteriously sits next to him and turns her laptop in. As usual Salman will try and flirt with her, and she decides to tell him a story. The story is about these 4 or 5 guys who work at a call centre. They all have some very minor every day problems in their life's. The films starts getting very slow and boring. Next thing you know you closed your eyes and then you open them and its almost 2 hours gone in the film. You see them in a car about to fall. They think they will die, but they receive a phone call that is apparently from god. God tells them that they should be grateful to be living. This is reminding me of a Hollywood film Saw, where Jigsaw killer does a similar thing. Anyway suddenly they start changing their lives all because of the phone call. Next thing a sleepy bored looking Salman Khan tells Katrina, who is she and Katrina does not answer. She disappears and guess what, Salman's bodyguards didn't see any girl. She was probably god, what the hell is this garbage. Anyway Sohail and Sharman are usually funny and try their best but still were poor. All other girls gave a disgraceful performance. Amrita's was playing a humble wife was a bore to watch. Anyway this film is a poor poor poor poor poor show all the way."
