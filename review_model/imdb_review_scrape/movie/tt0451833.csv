" A complete entertainer!","Anees Bazmee's 'No Entry' is one of the finest comedies to come out in the history of Indian Cinema. What a film! A complete entertainer.... fabulous script, made into a fabulous film. First-rate performances, good music and classy locales. 'No Entry' is a pure example of entertaining cinema, that too at its best. I've seen this film countless times, and I enjoy watching it per viewing. Two Big Thumbs Up for this 2005 Box Office Blockbuster Hit! Pluses of the film: Almost everything. Bazmee is a fantastic writer/director and No Entry proves that. The performances are first-rate: Anil Kapoor is the life of No Entry. He's fantastic in each and every frame he appears in. Salman Khan is in decent from, he plays to the gallery in an extended cameo. Fardeen Khan is superb. Lara Dutta is excellent. Celina looks alluring and does a decent job. Esha Deol doesn't get scope, yet she does well. Especially towards the end. Boman Irani is hilarious, ditto for the actress who plays his wife. Others are also good.Minuses: Salman's role could've been extended.on the whole 'No Entry' is a winner all the way... don't miss this one at any chance!" 
" Laugh all the way","I loved the movie. I became ill from laughing so much. Very simple, no violence and funny plot. I would highly recommend to everyone. All the girls were gorgeous ! Loved their clothes. Some of the scenes in the songs are a bit on the revealing side. Personally this is not a movie for young children. The actors and actresses did a very good job. There was not a single scene that I found unprofessional. Only complaint with the movie was the songs were awful. Anu Malik could have done a better job with the song writing and music. Anu, please don't use pathetic, partial English lyrics. It's so embarrassing to see them being sung in front of Western audiences. "Just Love Me" !! Come on Anu ! The male singer was awful and should never sing. CAST: Anil Kapoor, Bipasha Basu, Celina Jaitley, Esha Deol,Fardeen Khan, Lara Dutta, Salman Khan" 
" Funniest Film of the Year","No Entry is with out Doubt The Funniest Film of the Year. This is a roller coaster 3 hour ride of Entertainment at its Best. After a Long tome Anil Kapoor has given us a Great Movie with a very funny role. Fardeen Khan is Amusing at times, although i preferred his acting in Love ke liye kuch bhi karega. Salman Khan is hardly in the movie, but the scenes he does appear in are very funny. Lara Dutta is unpredictabilly Superb as the suspicios wife. Celina Jaitley has an immature role, but her sexy eyes and Good looks doesn't bother the movie. Esha Deol is effiecient in a small role. Bipasa Basu looks less and less sexier then her previous film Jism, where she looked stunning. No Entry is an absolute Must See packed with hours of fun and adventure." 
" Best comedy film after Hera pheri!!!!!!!!!","This movie by far is the best comedy movie to be made after Hera pheri Every single actor was amazing. I never liked fardeen khan but he wasnot bad in this movie. Anil Kapoor was bloody brilliant, his acting his always fantastic. Salman Khan was not bad Celina Jaitley was pathetic, she's hot though Anees Bazmee is a fantastic director a well deserved comment for him There should be a No Entry sequel as well But I still firmly believe that Hera Pheri and Andaz Apna Apna are the two best comedy films ever to be made in Bollywood. i recommend everyone to watch this film at least once in their lives!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!." 
" Laugh Riot","It is one of the Best Indian Comedy I even Watched. The Situation are Funny. Lyrics and dialogs are Hilarious. Total Laugh Riot. Contains no old jokes except the B+ joke which the director once used in his TV series. It got a lot of Chain Reactions, One thing leading to another. Worth every Penny and every Jiffy. And Don't ever miss the Ending. It's killing. You can't control your laughter. (I laughed till I fell off my chair.)All Comedy fans must watch this. You don't really need to know the language to enjoy this Awesome Hindi Movie. 150 minutes of Comedy. 95% of the movie are awesome-ly awesome.The DVD released so grab it ASAP." 
" The best bollywood comedy to date!","This was a film which for me lived upto the hype generated by it. Superb performances by the cast and absolutely awesome script writing and directorial work make this a comical masterpiece. Many scenes in this movie had me on the edge of my seat as to where the story would take me next, it was really brilliantly done. For a large percentage of this movie i was in fits of laughter due to the sheer comic genius of the script and how well the actors & actresses pulled it off. Even the serious moments were wonderfully done, mainly down to Anil Kapoors supreme acting. Overall, this film is a must have for any avid bollywood film fan and without a doubt makes it into my personal collection. Best Bollywood comedy i've had the pleasure of seeing :)" 
" No entry is a class comedy","This one is one of the most funniest movies ever seen. Salman was definitely the best. His expressions were just class. Surprisingly, Fardeen was GOOD in a comic role.He and Anil had great chemistry between them.They were class apart.Bipasha had played a striking role after a long time.Lara was very good in her Biwi No. 1 type role, but Esha hasn't got much footage.Celina was absolutely ravishing. Anil was also great. Boman Irani was also great even though he has got extremely less screen time than he deserved.Overall this movie is both comedy and bit goofy.Salman has very little screen time compared to Anil and Fardeen. Boman Irani is grossly underutilized. This reminded me of wonderful Hindi movies in the past like Andaz Apna Apna, Hungama, Munnabhai MBBS and Mujhase Shaadi Karogi." 
" Funny","No Entry,directed by Anees Bazmme was one of the biggest hits in 2005.The film promises big laughs.The best thing is that it promises laughs scene by scene.There are just some few scenes which make you feel ho-hum.But overall the film is a laugh riot. Direction by Anees Bazmee is very good.Music is okay.Dialogs are very good.Performance wise-Its Anil Kapoor who rocks the show.His comic timing is just so amazing.Salman Khan is good.Fardeen Khan is also funny. Among the 4 ladies.Lara Dutta is the best.Followed by Celina Jaitely who has screen presence.Bipasha Basu looks gorgeous.Esha Deol is weak. Boman Irani is wasted.Overall No Entry,deserves a watch." 
" The Best Comedy In Modern Indian Cinema","No Entry Directed By Aneez Bazmee Is The Best Comedy Feature Film In Modern Indian Cinema Alongwith Hera Pheri. The Actor's Did A Splendid Job With Fardeen Khan Falling Little Short Than Others While Lara Dutta Over Acted In Some Scenes But All In All A Very Funny Movie With Good Screenplay And Awesome Cinematography By The Great Indian Cinematographer Ashok Mehta.Anil Kapoor's Acting Is Evergreen Supported With Fantastic Peppy Numbers By Anu Malik Make This A Must For DVD Lovers Too To Buy This Out.Salman Khan's Role Is Short But Pretty Well Defined. The Climax Is Probably The Funniest Climax In Indian Comedy History.Dialogues Are Amazing But The Main Characteristics That Made The Movie So Amazing And Fully Worth Watching Was Acting, Music, Cinematography, Direction And Editing.In Short A Perfect Comedy Very Rare To See In Indian Cinema." 
" Hilarious.","Very funny movie. Songs are load of crap. But the pros outweigh the cons. The male actors perform very well as does Lara And Bipasha. Salman Khan is at ease playing a womaniser with charm. Anil Kapoor is on form playing the frustrated husband. Lara Dutta is equally good playing the untrusting wife. Fardeen Khan is a pro for his first time in comic role. Celina and Esha have minimal roles, but are adequate in their performances. Bipasha is at her sultry best as nightclub dancer paid by Salman to seduce Anil; Fardeen is also roped in under her spell. The wedding story, the Anil-Lara combo and ending are the high points. Leave your critics hat at home and enjoy this circus." 
" Great Humor","I enjoyed the movie very much. I found a great fun from most of the dialogues. Every actors and actresses did a great job in this movie. Particularly, Anil Kapoor did excellent and marvelous acting, which entertained me lot. His dialogues are very much hilarious. Basically, 'Be Positive (B+)'. Fardeen and Salman also acted very nicely. Salman's appearance was a small comparing to Anil Kapoor and Fardeen Khan. But this is because of the story. The story basically emphasize on the enormous twist with great ending. I loved the ending most.I laughed 95 % time of the total movie duration time. You should watch this movie to get real entertainment with obvious humor in each dialog. This movie deserves best score." 
" very entertaining, nice","Excellent. Well Made. Entertaining. Anil, Salman, Fardeen and all the girls have done a great job. Fardeen seems to look like Sylvester Stallone (or I am watching too many movies). Salman is beginning to look old. Anil Kapoor looks young given his age. Esha has done an excellent job. Â  Salman's ability to spin stories was hilarious ' excellent job Salman! Anil excels in his ability to play the scared husband - wonder if that is acting or normal!!The character of Bobby was really funny.Rajesh" 
" Enter...the NO ENTRY","Anil Kapoor, Fardeen Khan, Salman Khan= good times, it does not really matter who the heroines were. BUT Bipasha looked fabulous, I liked her ethnic look. I think she stole the show. The wives were arch typical (stereotypical). You had the dumb one, the suspicious one, and the bratty one. Most woman are a combination of these. The guys were a bit more complicated. Anil Kapoor played the good husband, Salman Khan played himself (kidding). They both played roles that were expected of them. Fardeen Khan showed range, he is very sensitive and that reflects in his work. I liked him in Khushi with Kareena, and in Fida. The entire movie was so silly that you could not stop laughing. I saw in the theater, at home with my parents then again with friends on video. Even Non-Indians enjoyed it, subtitles and all. One guy thought that SK looked late 20s, impressive. Salman Khan looks good, and it has nothing to do with bodybuilding. The entire movie was cast well." 
" This movie was the funniest movie ever","Well this movie is definitely the best Indian comedy ever. First there was Masti which was too funny that it roked so much. But then when I watched no entry i couldn't stop laughing. This film was pure comedy and the fact that it had salman khan made it better. He played his role superbly and his expressions were class. Anil looked so innocent at the beginning but turned into a serpent with the tongue of lying. Fardeen was funny in the beginning and kept helping out anil and going along with his lies. When they met up after anil's heart attack i was laughing so much. All their wives were confused and so was Bobby. This film is the funniest film ever. I can't believe this is a film. Its too good. So funny. Definitely the best comedy ever." 
" Humorous in parts....could have been better with some editing","By the time I walked out of the hall, I had a headache as well as a stomach ache. A headache because there are certain scenes in the movie that are totally unbearable, while certain others made me laugh a lot resulting in the above consequences. The movie is very colorful and has great humor in parts. However, some of the coincidences in the movie like everyone meeting in Mauritius and landing at the same hotel are a bit of an exaggeration. Right around there, there's a song that seems totally unnecessary; so are a few other songs. No Entry title song is a great item number. The actresses all have done a fair job. Anil, Fardeen and Salman have done a good job as well. Overall I would give this one a 7. Could have been better with some more editing." 
" Best comedy do not miss","This is a best comedy of salman khan after Maine pyar kyun kiya he is good in both moviesThey were both were proved successfully Songs are cult and super hit The direction is good background music is fine editing is superb story-line is hilarious screenplay is entertaining Salman does well Anil is funny fardeen is great Lara is amazing es-ha is good Celina is fine bi-pasha is the show steal-er 8/10Don't forget to watch"
