" Ganja Mangoge Coke Denge, Rishwat Mangoge Thok Denge","I first saw the movie at Mami and then at a college festival, i genuinely loved the movie. Title of the movie is something which also caught my attention but i would like to praise about the movie for one and one reason.. The Dialogues! Every dialogue is just so right and real.Characters are quirky and the movie is full of witty dialogues and fun elements. Actor Mayank, Naveen, Aditi and Karan(especially) have done a fantastic job with their characters. I would recommend to watch it in theaters.Kudos Amit"Sulemani"Masurkar!Cheers:D" 
" Unpretentious and hilarious- must watch!","Watched this at MAMI festival in 2013. Was one of the 3 best I saw that year! The audience was in splits. The film has a very simple story and yet you are completely engaged with the characters and their journeys. The two leads play struggling screen writing partners who are constantly aspiring to reach the "next level" in their careers- and you completely feel for them. The lead girl (who was earler seen in Talaash) is gorgeous. There are also some cameos by Bollywood insiders who spoof themselves in a sporty way. The best part about this film is that it is not trying hard to make you laugh or make a point. It is breezy, light and funny. This is the kind of film that makes you want more and the kind of fresh Indian cinema that I would like to watch more often." 
" Unrequited love amidst Bollywood","A funny comedy with adult themes but without the cheapness you'd expect in some alternate movies.The chief protagonist is a decent struggling writer in Bollywood who is teamed with a typical horny male writer. Together they dream of writing the next blockbuster. The film explores the world of the struggling youth today - the social interactions at various levels and the perpetually antagonistic society which appears to suppress the artistic qualities of otherwise gifted people.The downside is that while there appears to be some pace to the story, it doesn't seem to be going anywhere - and if you want to know what this contradiction means, go ahead and watch it for yourself !Both Naveen and Aditi make for decent lead artists, with a calmly suppressed personalities in a not so volatile background." 
" "Palang todo, Kalam mat todo"","Mainak and Dulal, the chemistry between them leaves you in splits. This 90-minute film, low budget film is a laugh riot. Ruma (Aditi Vasudev) charms with her screen presence, and confirms that her performance in Do Dooni Char was not a mere co-incidence. With just songs and some background scores, music is spot on. 'Door' song deserves a special mentions. However, the winner in this indie is by far the 'dialogues'. Kudos to actors for timing each of them so well. This movie would grow with word of mouth! At a breezy speed, 90 film just passes by leaving smile on your face. The movie is so real yet so filmy." 
" An excellent "bromantic" story","Sulemani Keeda is one of those rare films that needed to be created. A niche that needed to be filled. A comedy that makes you laugh, cry, wince, smile without having to resort to slapstick. A movie much needed amongst the onslaught of mindless 100-crore grossing "comedies" with item songs. The characters are real. These struggling writers could be any of the thousands of people who come to Bombay to make a living in this highly commercialized city's cinema industry. The producer's son who wants to make a movie about a story without a story but is 35 and waiting to be launched. The cute gen-next girl who quits law to do a career in photography. The censor board chief who lectures the writers to make "decent" films while staying at the farmhouse of the producer whose films he's supposed to review. The film is full of such characters you probably know in real life, and subtle yet illuminating moments that it's easy to miss them. The dialogues are sharp and witty, packing a punch at the right spots, making you laugh and ponder but never gets too serious. The soundtrack and background score are both breezy, soothing and very "indie", managing to create an atmosphere but does not overwhelm.The city is very much there in every frame yet stays in the background. Filmi-wallahs and Mumbai lovers especially will notice the city's famous hangouts and spots from Salman Khan's house to the Sewri mudflats visited for its famous flamingoes. An evocative scene is that of the lead character listening to his fortune being read from a multi-colored machine on Juhu beach offering empty neon- filled dreams much like the city it is set in.If you are used to a fast-paced, big-budget Bollywood masala movie with action, drama, item songs, big sets, stars and the usual, Sulemani Keeda is none of those things. At the end of it, it's a film--just like its fictional namesake referred to in the movie-- about a story with no story! Where the guy does not get the girl. There are no villains but real people, warts and all. There is an ending, but not necessarily happy or sad. The characters move on. Just like in life...." 
" A refreshingly different little gem","If you have a few brain cells, a sense of humour, and are as sick of the '100 crore' rubbish being churned out by Bollywood on a daily basis, please do watch this movie. You will love it. It is as indie as indie movies get, so don't expect it to look as slick and manufactured as your typical Bollywood Khan starer, but the very fact that it is an indie movie is what makes it so charming and refreshing (and lights another beacon of hope for a more diverse Indian film industry).The movie is about two struggling writers trying to get their screenplay produced - one a relatively straight-laced idealist, the other an in- your-face, street smart guy on the make, with a hidden vulnerability. The caste is virtually unknown - in fact most of them were not actors before this movie was made, but they are all from the movie industry. The lead, Naveen Kasturia (Dulal) worked as an Assistant Director, the co-lead, Mayank Tewari (Mainak), is a columnist, screen-writer, poet and amateur stand-up comic, the pseudo European art-house cinema loving producer's son and actor in waiting Karan Mirchandani (Gonzo) is a director. Only Ruma (Aditi Vasudev) was a professional actress at the time the movie was shot, but a very young one who had only just started in the industry (she had acted in Do Dooni Chaar and Talaash). And this really works, because they all bring a freshness and naturalness to their roles.The movie itself is a 'slice of life' piece about the fringes of the film industry, the hopes of the new aspirational middle class (who can now dream of being more than just doctors and engineers), young love, and above all, friendship. What shines through the most are the dialogues, which are crisp, sharp, natural and very very funny. Apparently a lot of them were improvised during the shooting process, which gives them a very unrehearsed feeling. There is the odd sequence where the editing could have been a wee bit tighter, but it doesn't take away from the charm of the movie.I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes the next big cult film in India, which people will be talking about 20 years from now, like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron and Andaaz Apna Apna.Bottom line - watch it." 
" Indeed bollywood is growing;","There are lot of Indian movies that make large money, and offer no content , famously called as Masala movies in India, 'Sulemani Keeda' is totally an opposite of that, Its filled with high quality content that is so true to its nature, that it holds your attention from beginning till the end. Its an Amazing cocktail of Comedy, philosophy , life. The cinematography,acting by the upcoming stars are truly bliss .The original satirical yet philosophical dialogues binds and engage the viewers. It simply narrates the biopic struggle of two 'bromatic' writers which is itself a refreshing experience, a mesmerizing one. Shouldn't be missed by anyone who enjoys true cinema.Every Character is so well placed . A lot set of hidden talents are show caused in this movie .Some satirical yet philosophical dialogues:" We have only one life why do u need to fear". "I fear because its only one life" "we need some out of the box idea. A film without story yet it has story" " i want to say you something.i think its too late but its time you start to grow up"Indeed bollywood is growing" 
" Tasteful, Hilarious, Fresh!","An original, autobiographical portrayal of struggles so unique to anyone who dares to follow his/her dreams. 'Sulemani Keeda' is about two bumbling amateurs struggling to make a mark in the world of script-writing for Hindi cinema, their attractions and distractions, with a lot of fun and hilarity thrown in.The character portrayals are amazing and many of them are funny especially the lead actor's sidekick Mainak, Gonzo, Sweety and Nene. Masurkar has done a great job with the script and direction. The chiaroscuro of hilarity with spells of seriousness, the international influences neatly tied with 'desi' locales and deliberate kitsch with sublime poetry all blends in superbly in the yarn he has spun with words as well as with the visuals.This movie has a lot of taste and in that it is very Woody Allen - the writers' influences are from Andrei Tarkovsky; the movie collection shows 'Cinema Paradiso'; the book being casually read is on Francois Truffaut; the cat is named 'Fellini' (feliney?) and even the title of the movie, and this is my guess, is inspired by Salman Rushdie. The poetry and music in this movie is little but profound and timely. And Masurkar's muse, Mumbai, is depicted charmingly using local trains, Colaba eateries, beaches and bachelor pad apartments, right down to the last detail.A thoroughly entertaining, fresh and hilarious watch - one of the best I have seen in a long time." 
" A piece straight out of the real life of struggling writers in the film world.","If you can forget about any specific plot, ready to watch natural performers instead of superstars, can ignore some extreme abuses used and willing to experience something straight out of the real life of two struggling writers knocking at every promising door in Mumbai then do give this a try by making a serious effort as a must. Particularly if you are among the ones who themselves have experienced such time in the city of dreams as a writer, actor or a creative technician looking for work and your first crucial break in the film world.Cleverly shot in a different, realistic mode by the debutant director Amit Masurkar, his SULEMANI KEEDA might not be a perfect winner, but it does have that much required freshness to offer post many mediocre projects supported by all big names. Its pleasingly authentic portrayal of two struggling writers, their try at girls in a bookstore, the unlimited rounds to the homes & offices of celebrities like Amrita Rao, Mahesh Bhatt, Anil Sharma and Aditya Chopra, their attempt to write something out of the box for their eccentric rich client, falling in love, fighting with each other and then surrendering to the corrupt system ignoring their own cherished art-form, truly gives you a quite mature account of the real life lived by such artists in Mumbai looking for that one major break.With many admirably natural performances from Mayank Tewari, Naveen Kasturia and the entire supporting cast, who don't really seem to be acting, the film many a times gives you a feeling of watching something straight from the real life shot in a docu-drama style. And that's where it scores the most despite losing the grip in the middle (due to the repetitive love affair) and then becoming all predictable towards the end of its 90 minutes duration. Shot in a simple but impressive manner on all next door Mumbai locations, SULEMANI KEEDA remains a comedy throughout maintaining a fine balance between real life and its unique characters. But along with that also represents the deep pain felt by every single person who comes to the city in search of name, fame and money in big numbers.It mocks at the film industry's way of functioning much better than the recent HAPPY ENDING and THE SHAUKEENS and has an interesting soundtrack and background score too adding to the overall impact. Yet admittedly it doesn't hit that hard in the end with the fun losing out to all familiar scenes in its final 45 minutes. Moreover, targeting only the urban youth or selected audience, the film is certainly not going to be seen and enjoyed by everyone as it seems. Having said that, it still gives you a name to watch in the future of its director Masurkar, who surely has a keen observing eye on the life around.Ending on a different note, SULEMANI KEEDA might only be rated as a realistic, promising first attempt by the entire team performing well, but it definitely needs to be given a chance without any doubt. Specifically if you are film writer yourself or often write about films of the present or the past on your own blog/site as a passionate hobby. And in case you are still not convinced then sample this one line from the film saying, "Agar Filmein Bechani Hain Toh Dukandaar Ki Tarah Socho, Writer Ki Tarah Nahin!"" 
" Life / something like it","Finally, an Indian indie that skirts the line between broad comedy and subtle ones, and is perhaps one of the best written works to come out of the industry by far.Save the final moments when it threatens to go all filmy on us, and almost does, this one's just a little short of perfect, even in terms of pacing and boasts some fine technical aspects for a low budget work.The acting as well, never comes across as amateurish in any way, an aspect that plagues most Indie productions, including those initial forays made by Kukunoor or movies like 'The great Indian butterfly' . This is a work made by film-makers who're sure about their craft, and are most definitely here to stay. Even the choice of shooting styles, camera angles, foreground scores and background scores are polished, with not a step faltering or out-of-place.The performances are right up there, and the characterization is comprehensive, with the viewers getting just enough information that is within the context of all the events unfolding in the protagonists' lives.The beginning few scenes though, I was not too sure, since it did take the flick a few spluttering starts to really get going (I think it really did after the poetry-reading sequence).Not too dark to put people off, but dark enough to laugh at all its gallows humor guiltily around your other half, this one's a good watch also for groups of close friends who wax nostalgic about using the 'S...keeda' term fondly, and with intent, to describe in real- earthy terms, various 'interesting' things going on with their lives.I do hope it lives a long life at the multiplexes. I might actually catch it once again next weekend. And, just in case you were wondering, yep, its that good." 
" This is the story of two writers waiting for their big break. They're dug into the dream of making a film called Sulemani Keeda","Indie films are a rarity in India. Rarer still are good ones. Sulemani Keeda is a little film that satires life in the periphery of the film industry. It's a bittersweet tale of how struggling writers' lives unfold in the glitzy by lanes of Mumbai. Some of it is truly hilarious, some profound and a little bit just doesn't make sense. Like any piece of art, it has its imperfect strokes. The story for example, is a tad too simple. Yet, the movie reflects upon certain insider truths of the industry that make for an invigorating experience.This is the story of two writers waiting for their big break. They're dug into the dream of making a film called Sulemani Keeda. But neither has any serious professional guile other than their honest aspiration. They also come with a set of prejudices and stereotypes. Mainak (Mayank Tiwari) for one is the trash talking guy who thinks he's better than the world. Dulal (Naveen Kasturia) on the other hand is a classic case of hesitation getting the upper hand on talent. The two make an unlikely writing pair and you're introduced to their lives as they beg for a chance to the likes of Mahesh Bhatt, Anil Sharma and Amrita Rao. Let's just say their career prospects are borderline pathetic and it doesn't help that the two know nothing about scoring with chicks. But when Dulal meets Ruma (Aditi Vasudev) things seem to change for the better. But they also run in with trouble when Mainak and Dulal decide to write a film for Gonzo Kapoor (Karan Mirchandani). The only big conflict in the film is predictable and yes you could argue that's how the cookie crumbles in real life. But then again, good writing can make fact stranger than fiction. That's what worked for films like Jaane Bhi Do Yaro and Chashme Buddoor. With Sulemani Keeda, it's the dialogues that steal the show. They're funny, quirky and then on moments they're a revelation. The 'perhaps it's time to grow up' line hits you like a rock. Masurkar does a fantastic job with the lines, not so much with the script though.Then to say that visuals could've been better is really nitpicking. End of the day, this is an indie film. It doesn't even have the budget of a commercial b-grade movie. Even so, one has to contend with unimaginative camera work. This point only becomes a subject of criticism because we're talking mainstream exhibition. If Sulemani Keeda had been a niche product one could've overlooked the lack of quality in its imagery. Especially because certain parts show you the team was capable of shooting good frames. But the inconsistency robs the movie of its punch. It's not a major deterrent. But it is enough to put off the average movie viewer.The great thing about the movie though is its cast. Naveen, Mayank, Aditi and Karan are the four pillars on which Masurkar builds his story. Naveen's performance with the subliminal nervous energy and the totally gullible personality is good. Better still is Mayank's performance which shows a character with brazen disregard for the system. He swears everywhere and he's just spearheading into everything he jokes about. These are real characters and the actors do a more than good job. Aditi and Karan are in shorter roles but their performances are superb. Karan especially looks creepily awesome in his Tarkovski inspired role.A special mention to the CGI scene where Karan's character snorts cocaine. This particular scene belongs in such memorable movies like Pineapple Express and This Is The End. This is beyond hilarious. It will give you a stomach ache. A thousand likes to Masurkar for deviating from the norm and having the audacity to try something different. But, a story is the heart and soul of a film. And Sulemani Keeda falls short on that aspect by some margin. Clever writing and word play do save the scene. But then it could've been better." 
" Engaging, Mature and a lot of Fun!","I watched Sulemani Keeda in an almost empty theatre and throughout the film I just kept asking the question: Why? Before I begin writing anything about the merits/demerits of the movie, I must say that we need more movies like this. The story of Sulemani Keeda is nothing to go gaga over but the almost non existential direction in its depiction of friendship gives it a conspicuously vicarious emotion; almost nostalgic at times. The story starts with a couple of aspiring writers trying to make it big in the big bad world of Bollywood. Dulal played by an excellent Navin Kasturia marvelously underplays his character. His naivety in many scenes makes you root for him. And, Mayank Tewari playing Mainak, complementing the almost tangible innocence of the Dulal with his loudmouth and unkempt attitude makes us believe the character even more. In one particular scene of the movie, Mainak recites a profane poem in a bar with gusto and 'I don't give a damn' attitude just after Dulal had read a poignant poem. The scene becomes extremely sweet and corny in equal measures. The title 'Sulemani Keeda' refers to the title of the film which Mainak and Dulal desperately want to write. In the pursuit of becoming writers, they meet with a producer's son called Gonzo (Yeah, the name is enough to crack you up) who is hell bent on making Bollywood film in Eastern European style cinema with full frontal male nudity. What ensue are some really funny scenes and an emotional one towards the end. The love track between Dulal and Ruma (Aditi Vasudev) is a sweet and introspective one. The discussion between them inspires Dulal to not succumb to the societal pressures but chase his dreams. Ruma's pragmatism makes you appreciate the character. The film's bare bones depiction of friendship, the anguish of lost love and most importantly the struggle to make it big on your own terms resonates long after the movie is over. It is mature and fun in equal parts. The only problem I had with the film was its ending. It felt like a desperate attempt to make the film unconventional and hatke. It certainly could have been different. This minor qualm aside, the film is a little gem and definitely deserves a watch. ~Shubham Rakheja" 
" A sweet comedy that reminds us of the current state of film production and distribution","Sulemani Keeda has been billed as one of India's first mumblecore films, as its low-budget shooting style, amateur actors, naturalistic dialog, and rather plain directing have made it easy to lump into the American-born subgenre (not movement) in filmmaking. If this is any key to where low-budget Indian cinema is headed, I'll be a full-fledged supporter, for this is one of the funniest films of the subgenre I've seen in quite sometime.The film concerns Dulal and Mainak (Naveen Kasturia and Mayank Tewari), two slacker roommates that dream of making it big in the Bollywood film industry one day with their script "Sulemani Keeda" (Hindi for "pain in the ass"). The two wind up going all around their community, being rejected by producers all over, until they finally find the financial and distributional assistance of Gonzo Kapoor (Karan Mirchandani), the drug-addicted son of a famous B-movie producer. He hires them to write a quirky art-house film for his directorial debut, which will serve as the game-plan for the two men to break out into the movie business until Dulal meets Ruma (Aditi Vasudev), a gorgeous photographer, his goals become secondary to pleasing his newfound love interest, much to the dismay of Mainak.Sulemani Keeda has the kind of showbiz comedy that isn't so meta and reliant on the interworkings of Bollywood to remain interesting nor as basic and as insubstantial to resort to dreary comedy clichés. It exists somewhere in the middle; a film that is pleasantly human and memorably comedic, as it focuses on two optimistic but unmotivated men who know they want to create beloved films but have a hard time figuring out how exactly to get said film out to the public.Such a film wouldn't be as successful without the pleasant chemistry of Kasturia and Tewari, who provide Harold and Kumar/Bill and Ted like sensibilities here. They are men engulfed in their own laziness, but pleasantly so, never resorting to malicious tactics but simply caught in their own realm of off-color jokes and goofy nature. Consider when Dulal tries to get the attention of Ruma in a bookstore, upon first meeting her, and the end result is a tragic misunderstanding that has Mainak simply grateful it wasn't him who embarrassed himself.Scenes like this are the gas in Sulemani Keeda's tank, which is a thoroughly pleasant comedy that could very well introduce people to Bollywood in a casual manner. Many Bollywood films are long (some long as seven or eight hours), and here is an eighty-nine minute film that feels more like a cinematic exercise than a formal film. It's a sweet, endearing story of the struggle to make one noticed in a sea of independent talent and corporate-controlled industry, and Kasturia and Tewari work to give the film a rare, lively spark of unbridled chemistry that charms as much as the simple script and basic shooting methods of a memorable, foreign comedy.Starring: Naveen Kasturia, Mayank Tewari, Aditi Vasudev, and Karan Mirchanadani. Directed by: Amit V. Masurkar." 
" Another Pseudo film","Yet another pseudo film. Shabbily shot and written, This boring film about two young screen writing pals looking to trade their TV job for a ticket to Bollywood is transformed into boring young urban comedy, The title has limited appeal to smart local audiences who recognize the writers' hangouts in the western Mumbai suburbs and get the inside jokes. The writers also wander around Bollywood offices futilely trying to peddle their script until they stumble upon Gonzo Kapoor (the well-cast Karan Mirchandani), a muscular playboy whose producer-father is willing to bankroll a vehicle to launch his aging heir. There isn't that much here that's narratively new and poor direction doesn't help either. Complete avoid." 
" Disappointing","Suleimani Keeda was a film which was recommended to me by someone who loved TVF Pitchers, I was told that Naveen Kasturia is a good actor and since I am also a writer, i will be able to relate to the bros in suleimani keeda. Suleimani keeda looks promising from the outside with a feel of Mumbai, relationships and a look at the life of two struggling writers. Well, looking into the detail, Naveen's character looked promising at first, when you look at him, he is the one who reads books, recites poetry and looks like someone who loves poetry. Now the flaw. If Naveen is in love with poetry, you expect him to recite it in a clearer tone, he recites the poetry in a very immature manner. His love for writing is not at all visible in the film. Why would a struggling writer who is getting an opportunity of a lifetime is not interested in writing, instead of doing his work, he is more inclined to meet the girl. The friend( i am sorry, i forgot his name) is not a writer. He has no perspective and he looks more like a TV writer rather than a film writer. Watching tarkovsky or trauffat will not make you a writer. Now the delhi connection- They don't look like delhiites, they don't talk like delhiites and none of them had the attitude of a delhiite (I know this, because I am from Delhi). We hardly see the change over of naveen's character, He wanted to see the world and become the writer he wanted to be, but the trigger point was too weak. The fight between the two was contrived. It was useless, the writer only wanted them to part ways so that Naveen can become a novel writer and the friend is still a screen writer. The direction was much better than the story at hand, Chemistry between the Bros was missing. Over all it was a good effort, but not a movie. I am surprised to see so many good comments, maybe TVF is at it, but the movie is a fail." 
" A fine start","There are few good things about a debutant's work. Firstly, you don't have any expectations from the work. Secondly, you can be as critical as you like without worrying about the trolls. Also, you are elated when such a work leaves you tickled in the end. The film portrays beautifully the solution to the age old problem of the 'writer's block'. Through the two friends, Mainak and Dulal, it depicts different choices one makes to overcome the block. The film considers overcoming this block as a life changing event in the life of a creative professional. The film reminds one of the 'cult' classic Barton Fink(1991) where the directors Coen Bros. took a deep dark turn when their protagonist was faced with same writer's block. The film is drenched in a amateurish style which adds a raw edge to the film and hence an eight(8). Humour is good and apart from the theme this is the only other thing which sticks with you for a little longer. The film seemed too self aware sometimes, i.e. giving details of what is transpiring, a signature evolved from Fellini's(Gonzo's cat :P) 81/2."
