" the best comedy i have seen in my life and i have seen many","Hera Pheri is a film set in Mumbai and is not your run of the mill slapstick comedy that directors like David Dhawan indulge in. The movie is directed by Priyadarshan who proved that after making such wonderful and serious film like Virasat, he can also direct a comedy with élan.This film is a comedy of error. Set in a Mumbai slum where our three protagonists dwell, the movie depicts the hilarious moments created by the simplicity and/or stupidity of the characters. The look of the film is that of an art film. By the look of it, it seems as if it is going to be a really serious movie but it turns out to be one roller-coaster ride of laughter. The cast of the film includes Sunil Shetty who plays an unemployed guy who comes to Mumbai looking for work and a place to live. He lands up at the house of a simple man played deftly by Paresh Rawal who takes Sunil in. However, there is another person living in the house, namely Raju. Played by Akshay Kumar, Raju is the mischief monger and good for nothing. He keeps on getting jobs and losing them quickly. The story is taken forward by a phone call by the gangster Kabira who keeps on saying that he has kidnapped his grand daughter (sunil takes the call) and wants ransom. This call kickstarts a mayhem. Which ultimately leads us to the climax of the film where the protagonists end up becoming millionaires. Each and every member of the cast is brilliant in the performance of their roles. Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar's careers were in doldrums when this film released and both of them gave a stunning performance. Especially Akshay Kumar shows impeccable comic timing. Akshay Kumar is considered of the best comic actors of Bollywood these days after performing comic roles in films like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Khakee, Aawara Paagal Deewana and Waqt. However, the show stealer is none other that the unbelievable Paresh Rawal who plays Baburao Ganpatrao Apte. He is an absolute delight to watch. It will be an understatement to say that he completely overshadows the rest of the actors with his marvellous portrayal of a poor Mumbaiyya simpleton. This film changed the course of his career and he is now reckoned as a character actor who adds to the star value of a film. The music is not that good though. The song "Main Ladka Pom Pom" is hilarious though. The picturization keeps you in splits even though the song is irritating if you only listen to the audio. The real hero of the film is the dialogue writer Neeraj Vohra who comes up with some never before heard one liners. Anyone who wants another example of his great work must watch Aawara Paagal Deewana. In short, a film for every comedy lover. Some clean entertainment. Moreover, I can confidently say that this is the best comedy film i have seen in my life. Brilliant!" 
" Fun all the way!!!","Priyadarshan has a habit of making either extremely boring movies or extremely colourful ones, and I am happy to say that this is one of his finer efforts. This movie is a fun ride from start to finish. The characters are well projected and have a solid background, but more importantly the storyline is well written without flaws, which makes this clean comedy. Bravo Priyadarshan!!!PS:Never thought someone would give a leading role to Paresh RawalI give it a 9/10" 
" A light comedy everyone will enjoy","I never expected much from this movie, because of the cast: Fading Sunil Shetty, sabseboringKhiladi/monkeyboy Akki and serious Tabu. The only hope i had was in Paresh Rawal. After seeing him in the hilarious Andaz Apna Apna (Highly recommended), he was to be taken notice of.So when I did watch it I was shocked to say the least. I found Hera Pheri to be one the best comedies of the decade. Just forget about the cheap attempts of David Dhawan called comedy. This is the real deal.The story is simple (as is with many good movies). The 3 protagonists Shyam (Sunil Shetty), Raju (Akshay Kumar) and Babu Rao (Paresh Rawal) are all in dire need of money. Shyam needs it to pay back an old friend (Om Puri) so he can get his(as in Puri's) sister married. Raju needs it for his mother and Babu Rao to pay back loans his father took. When a local rich man's grand daughter gets kidnapped by 'dangerous' gangster Kabira (Gulshan Grover) calls Babu Rao's number by mistake, Raju sees an end to all their problems. He suggests they play a game, do some hera pheri. And the movie is off to take you for an awesome ride.Performances by far surprised me. Sunil Shetty I never liked, but his performance as the somewhat naive do-gooder was wonderful. Akki ape also surprised me in his sense of comedic timing. But Paresh was the biggest surprise. Even though he was my only hope for this movie, he came out ten times better than I expected. He deserved the best comedian Filmfare Award, that he did receive for 2000. Tabu (Anu) as another person in need of money who fights with Shyam for a job is also competent. It is a small role but as always she leaves her mark. Asrani in a tiny role also gives some laughs. Om Puri was also excellent in his small role.So Bravo Priyadarshan saheb! Once again you've shown that you are a unique and intelligent filmmaker with a lot of tricks up your sleeve. One tip though, don't think too much about the logic of the story or the probability. Just turn off your brain for a few hours and enjoy. You'll find yourself cracking up every time you think of "Kabira speaking". Watch the movie and you'll know what I mean." 
" The Best Indian Comedy Movie 'EVER'.","Talk of comedy in Indian cinema , and anybody would snap "Hera Pheri". This is one of the movies which make a permanent imprint on your mind and give you a lot to talk about. With snappy dialogs , impeccable story and a perfect combination of actors and actresses this is certainly a must see. With Indian cinema being crippled by the "HIGH" emotional dramas containing stories of ultimate suffering of impossible proportions, Hera Pheri was the turning point, where all the bollywood film industry saw the power of a simple comedy. Starring Paresh Rawal, Suniel Shetty , Akshay Kumar , Tabu , Asrani, Om Puri , Gulshan Grover Hera Pheri had all the ingredients of a super hit. If you hate Indian movies and are against all the high melodrama dose you get free with a DVD of Indian movie, Hera Pheri is just the movie for you. With a sequel now being aired "Phir Hera Pheri" which is too good for a sequel. Go watch both of these movies and have a big laugh." 
" A great Comedy movie","Wow, This is what I call a great comedy in 2-3 hours, it will make you laugh as you are suppose to laugh.  Great acting by Paresh Rawal will make you feel that he is the best for the role given to him and he did justice with what has been given to him.  Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar has done there part very good, but I think the crown for the movie goes to Paresh Rawal.A good movie, with good story and excellent comedy.  Its a must watch for people who like to enjoy there spare time." 
" Awesome movie","You won't believe it but it is true that I have seen this movie 17 times and I am still not tired of watching. I saw it on the theatres first and I loved it and then I bought it on DVD. This movie rocks. I love the performance of Paresh Rawal. Akshay kumar and sunil shetty also gives great performances. This movie really makes me laugh. My rating- 10/10" 
" Great Comedy Film","This along with Andaz Apna Apna are my most favorite Bollywood Comedy Movies. Every time I watch Heara Pheri I just can't stop laughing. The first time I watched it I couldn't sleep most of that night because I just continued to laugh on my bed.10 on 10 for me. Although I enjoyed other comedy movies of Priyadarshan like Hungama, Hulchul & Garam Masala and thought those were no less than Hera Pheri, but later when I watched those again they were not so funny as Hera Pheri. Akshay Kumar's acting was great but Paresh Rawal with his character Babu Rao is the one who steals the show, Sunil Shetty, Tabu and Om Puri also played their parts well.Hera Pheri I believe is a milestone in Bollywood because it showed that you don't always need a emotional romantic/patriotic movie to produce a Hit Movie. This movie started a much needed trend of Bollywood Comedies that relied more on stories, errors and confusions for its fun element breaking away from those cliché slapstick comedies of David Dhawan starring Govinda. However the sequel to this movie Phir Hera Pheri I must say was disappointing, the first half was OK but the second half was really poor especially the circus scenes. That movie I guess lacked the Priyadarshan touch . Anyways there are talks about a third version of Hera Pheri and that I hope will be as funny as this one.BTW this movie is a remake of a Southern Movie...So those who have a problem with remakes and also those who lack a Sense of Humor should stay away." 
" Best Comedy Movie in Hindi EVER MADE","From the first scene itself, you start laughing and keep until 'The End'. Strong performances by paresh, akshay and (even) sunil. excellent screenplay and a tight story. even the scenes like two highly desperate (sunil and tab) and unemployed struggling to secure a job inside a bank leave us laughing. Priyadarshan is really a brilliant director, crafting hilarious characters and instances from daily life. just to remind with a dialog: /*not include because written in Hindi and not accepted as spelling mistakes by IMDb*/(in English: a tenant beats up his landlord like a dog'(landlord babu Bahia alerted) 'reason - girls, babu Bahia, girls) and not to forget, nicely woven songs like 'denewala jab bhi data, deta chap par fa-ad K' add to the movie experience." 
" Only for audience Understanding Hindi","It is a light-heart old Indian comic , suitable only for the audience from Indian Sub-continent. My dear Non-Hindi speaking friends , its a good movie only if you understand Hindi . Does not make any sense for you to watch the movie dubbed in any other language ( as the comedy and timing goes well with the native language) because it is in TOP 250 list and then write a review that would be titled as "Spoiled My day " . No offense to anyone , everyone has their freedom to express their views like I did :)I have seen many non-Indian friends complaining about this , thus writing this review ." 
" Funniest Movie Atter "Padosan"","A movie is funny, when you can laugh at Om Puri. In fact he brings more laughs than the main characters. I could easily compare him to Robert De Nero, who excelled in "Analyze Me" and he never envisioned himself as a funny actor. The script is superb and the laughter is infectious with the venerable master of comedy, Paresh Rawal, at the helm. Akshay Kumar, who is other wise pathetic in serious roles, makes a good team with the muscle man Shetty, whose acting skills, are in the same range as Kumar's! After "Padosan" there has been some sprinkling of comedy, more like buffoonery, with the likes of Aaamir Khan, Johnny Lever and Shakti Kapoor, whose comedy interludes appeal to the "sophisticated front bencher's" who like fart jokes and toilet humor and Anti-Indian and demeaning humor produced by the "Benchods of Bollywood" as in films like "Three Idiots", "Delhi Belly" etc. The front benchers like filth since they live in the slums and this is the best they have seen in their life. They worship these "Monkey's of Mumbai" the Midget, The Ugly and The Apeman, since they are promoted by the "Media Maggots of Mumbai" who give glorious reviews for the price of banana thrown at them time to time. The comedy was generally demeaning, cheap and vulgar. But the audience had to put up with this, since there was no alternative, and they were not to blame since the scribes were not funny in the first place. The scene is changing with the script-writers and director the caliber of Priyadarshan. This is one funny movie that has opened the flood-gate for movies like "Mallammal Weekly" and others." 
" One Minute silence for those who gave this masterpiece one star","Oh God how can anyone give Hera Pheri one star.
God damn it, they have not enough sense of humor to crack Jokes of this film.See some nonsense foreigners are saying worse Indian movie ever. Dear bro & sis, If you really want to enjoy Hera Pheri learn Hindi first. Unlike other Indian film subtitle can't give Justice Hera Pheri. Surely they have ruined humor of dialogues." 
" Best comedy movie ever. And akshay kumar ia best.","Akshay kumar is best actor. All actor is best. Best comedy of bollywood. Best direction. Best screenplay. Best editing." 
" Classic","One of the greatest movie ever made in Bollywood, it fills you with laughter, joy. A cult classic." 
" Baanngg!","You won't believe it but it is true that I have seen this movie 17 times and I am still not tired of watching. I saw it on the theatres first and I loved it and then I bought it on DVD. This movie rocks. I love the performance of Paresh Rawal. Akshay kumar and sunil shetty also gives great performances. This movie really makes me laugh. My rating- 10/10" 
" Best Hindi Comedy ever made","All comedy fan knows, no one makes as good comedies as Priyadarshan does. and for me, this is the best comedy he has ever done and also best in Hindi cinemas. There are other old good comedies like goalmaal and angoor but this is better than all of those.. No doubt it took all the comic award in 2000. Any Hindi comedy movie fan must watch this.. Best movie ever. If you like this one then you will also enjoy Hungama by the same director and Awara Pagal Deewana. Paresh Raval is the best Hindi comedian in modern era. Don't miss this movie.10/10." 
" Wonderful classic comedy","I love love love this movie and have watched it several times, and each time I laugh out loudly. Its one of those classic comedies that you can watch over and over and appreciate even more for the lack of truly funny movies in this genre. The comedy is completely slapstick, but Paresh Rawal, Akshay Kumar, and Sunil Shetty make it work so well. This is where Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar's comedy partnership commenced, and they have worked in more successful comedies.The story is about three men who have an opportunity to con someone, and everything ends well. I highly recommend it, but be prepared for slapstick comedy. Om Puri is also added to the mix and is funny as well. Om and Paresh make a good pair too."
