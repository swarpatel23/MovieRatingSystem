" I liked it","Though it is a word to word copy of the British movie "Death at a Funernal", I must say it is a good copy !!! Unlike many Bollywood films that are inspired from other films, this movie actually keeps the audience entertained. I totally enjoyed this movie. Prem Chopra was awesome as an irritating short tempered Uncle Murphy. Surprisingly Aftab Shivdasani did justice to his part. Javed Jaffery as always kept me entertained with his antics. Aarti Chhabria, Kim Sharma, Tulip Joshi were given short roles which they performed well. Sophiya Chaudhury was eye candy with her comic timing and appeal. I am surprised that in IMDb the cast for this movie does not have Chunky Pandey in it. Along with Jaffery, Chunhky Pandey's comic timing was great. The entry of Rajpal Yadav was yet another spice added to the comedy angle of the movie. In total, it is a good enjoyable comedy, much better than many comedy movies that try to poke the audience to make them laugh. Grab a bag of popcorn and watch it with you friends...!!!" 
" A Good Comedy","The title rang a bell and it made me remember one of those disco songs by the group Boney M and indeed the title is just that. But having not had much chance to watch the promos of this movie, it was something that I had not expected but having seen that who the producers gave me a small clue as to what it would be like. A father passes away and his eldest son arranges for the funeral and invites close family members and family friends. But one person is unknown to all and all hell breaks loose when this person says something that no one had expected, not even the family members of the deceased.Starring Sunil Shetty, Aarti Chhabria, Chunky Pandey, Ashish Choudhary, Prem Chopra, Tulip Joshi, Kim Sharma, Rajpal Yadav, Aftab Shivdasani, Javed Jaffrey and Suhasini Mulay, Sharat Saxena, Javed Jaffrey and Sophiya Chaudhary. This is directed by K. Muralimohana Rao and produced by Indra Kumar and Ashok Thakeria.What can go wrong at a funeral? Well the best person to ask is Sunil Shetty, as this role really suited him. He is not just an action hero and films such as "Hera Pheri" have proved that he is also good at comedy and this confirms this. All the actors are also good and that includes Chunky Pandey, Aftab Shivdasani, Javed Jaffrey and also Prem Chopra. Its good to see the old villain do a role such as this.This is a good comedy genre movie and the story line ensures that the audience is not bored as there some hilarious moments in the film and will give one a good laugh. There are some scenes which some may find as inappropriate but nevertheless, they do not ruin the comedy.A good comedy." 
" No subtitles makes this hard to watch","There are no subtitles available on this film's DVD. I want to see it with English subtitles because without them, I can only guess where the jokes are supposed to be.I like Sunil Shetty. I really liked the British original of this story "Death at a Funeral". I so wanted to like this version too. But, can't tell what's being said except when they lapse into Hinglish or full on English. Please, someone, subtitle this one for the rest of us. Producers of the DVD, c'mon, include the rest of us in the fun, please. There is an increasing market for Indian films outside of India. Kindly let the rest of us understand. When you add the English subtitles, I will buy a copy of the DVD." 
" This is an awful comedy","Daddy Cool, directed by K Murali Mohan Rao, is a crude remake of the British comedy, Death At A Funeral, but in this film the laughs are hard to come by. The action's centered around a group of assorted relatives and friends who gather at the home of a recently departed chap (played by Sharat Saxena) to bid him a final farewell. But when drugs, sex, and an attempted murder are thrown into the mix, the funeral turns into something of a circus. Daddy Cool recycles many jokes from the original film -- the delivery of a wrong corpse, the inadvertent consumption of party drugs, and the entry of a mysterious stranger bearing a shocking secret -- but between the film's dialogue writers and actors, they manage to serve up every single one of them in a loud, slapstick, crass style. They throw in a few of their own jokes too -- the cat-and-mouse chase between a suspicious, nagging wife and the husband she's convinced is fooling around behind her back; also the track involving the voluptuous model hunting down the man she's agreed to sleep with in exchange for an advertising contract -- but these gags are clich√©d and not very smart at all. If you do find yourself laughing on a few occasions, it's mostly out of disbelief at just how shockingly bad this film turns out to be. The acting is an assembly line of over-the-top, ham jobs from a cast that is possibly the most ineffective you've ever seen. A special mention of Aftab Shivdasani, Chunky Pandey and Vrajesh Hirjee who take the cake for being the most annoying actors on screen. Contrived and unimaginative, this remake pales in comparison to Death At A Funeral.It's a dead duck of a film that ought to be promptly buried just like its protagonist."
