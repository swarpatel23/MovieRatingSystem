" Waste of 2 hours.","When I noticed Sanjay Suri in this movie I got the impression that this maybe worth watching. With an initial interesting portion involving scenes of him and Ashish Chaudary making hilarious disscusions, I predicted the movie would be funny. Unfortunately the movie had nothing fresh or novel to offer. Neither a different insight in to the institution of marriage was presented. This movie does not hold against movies like 'Anuranan' or even 'Life Partner'. All actors performed well. But with a lame script there was no substance in the plot. There was a lot of potential to progress the plot towards slapstick situations. Mandira Bedi gets the opportunity to act in another movie, but she is wasted. Maybe her hubbie director should quit making movies altogether."
