" Great blend of comedy and emotion.","The movie is superb, according to me. This is what you can get from the movie in general:1)Comedy2)Emotion3)Entertainment4)Reflection of a part of Indian society5)Deteriorated love v/s Fresh love6)Minor suspense momentsSo, why should you watch this movie?Well, it has a really great cast with fresh elements of joy and emotion. It introduces lead actor with a character of a guy who may not be big in his life, but is in his heart. The lead actress has the character of a dejected (and rejected) girl who is perceived to be gone crazy but has her own unheard story that proves her awe worthy.The comedy is just how much a movie should have and has some really great, fresh puns. There are some transition between serious/emotional scenes and comedy scenes to keep the audience happy-sad and light-hearted. The emotional scenes are amazing and at times with the blend of our TV serial drama (guess some of the cast then). However, Parineeti literally made me forget it's a movie with her real like cry and expressions.The verdict that all the people returning from long years of foreign land exposure and acquiring wrong sorts of habits within that period is thrashed. It is not a concept in the movie but wanted to mention this as I would probably join the herd of foreign returns. Anyways, put your faith in me and watch this movie.If however you have doubts in the movie, ensure that you have a big crowd coming in to watch the movie with you. Believe me, the power of fake laughs in TV serials actually works at times – psychologically speaking.Source: http://pratikkataria.tumblr.com/post/76016747154/" 
" Parineeti Rocks in this RomCom !!","Just watched this movie in theatres today morning and I just loved it.The story is abt Nikhil (Malhotra) who meets Meeta (Chopra) at the latter sister's wedding while she is running away. They again meet seven years later when Nikhil is abt to get married to Karishma (Sharma), Meeta's sister. This time Karishma gives him the responsibility of taking care of her and keeping her away from her family.I was impressed with the writers and the director. Its not ur usual run of the mill RomCom because within the story, there are many layers such as Meeta and her father's (Joshi) relationship from whom she stole money 7 yrs ago or Nikhil not trying to dump his fiancé, Karishma in spite of she breaking the relationship many times earlier or Meeta being a brilliant scientist who can fix cars or speak fluent Chinese.The movie has some excellent dialogues, scenes and some funny side characters such as Nikhil's father who is a retired cop or Nikhil's relative who an Indian Idol contestant. My favorite scene is when Nikhil's father suspects Meeta for stealing an expensive necklace which left me in splits.The drawbacks in the film are the not so melodious songs except for 'Zehanaseeb' which slow down proceedings in the 2nd half or the lengthy climax. Malhotra in his 2nd outing is confident. His character of a confused under confident man trying to do his best to keep all happy is tricky but Malhotra proves his mettle. He is still a stiff actor who can do comedy but I suggest he stick to romcom or drama movies.The rest of cast put a good performance especially Joshi, Sharma and Saxena.However, Chopra walks away with all honors. I'm happy to say that finally there is a Hindi film heroine who is not dumb but a genius scientist. She is smart, witty, caring, selfish and yet deep inside she is depressed and seeks the love of her father. When she is on screen, the movie moves to another level. She the only reason why I say this movie rocks....go watch it for her performance." 
" Found an answer to Jab We Met!","Before I get on with the review, let me tell you I'm not a hardcore Parineeti fan. Just like I'm not Kareena's fan even though Jab We Met is in my top 5 list. I went in to watch Hasee to Phasee casually without any expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. I found the movie to be superb! From a critics point of view, this movie has nothing new to offer. In fact, you can complain about many things. But this is one movie, where I beg to differ with the critics. Even though I have seen such movies plenty of times, I couldn't help myself from loving Parineeti's character. And needless to say, nobody but Parineeti could have brought the character to life.Aggressive, Submissive and Whacky! Parineeti's character Meeta has so many shades, you couldn't tell what she'd do next. The only thing I didn't like was : hero falling head over heals for a girl he met just a week back. Maybe they could have given more time for their relation to mature. But that doesn't stop me from LOVING each and every bit of the movie. Like the sequence where the heroine casually asks her sister's fiancé to marry her. Or, the "locked in the room" sequence where Parineeti gives an excellent performance.I couldn't give much credit to Adah Sharma for acting. Having said that, she is also extremely gorgeous. I'd definitely like to see her in more movies. Chemistry between the lead actors is quite sparkling, and I was quite satisfied with how the things turned out.I'll be heading to the theater soon to watch this movie again. This movie is definitely going to be in my Top 10 list." 
" A good rom-com.","I wasn't particularly impressed by Siddharth Malhotra in Student of the Year. On the other hand Parineeti was good in Ishaqzaade and superb in Shuddh Desi Romance. I was eager to see Bollywood's newest pair. They did not disappoint. Siddharth put in a good performance . He looked comfortable in his role. He had good chemistry with Parineeti. I think rom-coms might just be his forte.Parineeti Chopra stole the show. She plays Meeta, a girl who is brilliant but eccentric. Parineeti makes you laugh and cry. Playing such a role would not have been easy for someone who is doing only her fourth film. But she did an excellent job and proved that she is a fine actress. This young lady will go a long way.The plot was predictable but good performances from the leads make this a good movie. 8/10" 
" One of "The Best movies of 2014"","I've writing this review, right after watching this movie!! This movie will definitely be rated among the best movies of 2014.1. Story-line - It's a simple one, nothing in Greek n Latin, but the way it's shaped and pictured is amazing. 2. Star-cast - Both Sid & Pari did a great job, I would rate Pari's performance 10/10 in this movie, she was simply superb3. Music - Was superb :)Cinematography was good, and so were the melody tracks composed by Vishal-Shekar. A minor drawback of the movie is its length. A trimmed version without some unnecessary tracks would have helped.It's a mixed baggage of emotions, love & laughter!!!Overall, a superb entertainer, must watch, watch it in "Theaters" :)" 
" Hasee toh Phasee: Redefining Romance","Parineeti Chopra's livewire Meeta doesn't become the victim of what initially looks like a 'taming of the shrew' story, while Sidharth Malhorta's charming Nikhil doesn't make of her the demand to conform. Hasee toh Phasee is enchanting in the sense that it gives Bollywood romance that lovable twist which was indeed long overdue. Set against a big fat Indian wedding and a herd of annoying relatives that cannot be done away with, Hasee toh Phasee pleases by critiquing what it seems to exalt. It's indeed one of the very first commercial Hindi films to foreground the hegemony of the family and the pressure it unnecessarily exerts on those who are different. I am absolutely delighted that Karan Johar, the devoted perpetrator of lachrymose family dramas in Bollywood, has broken out of that bubble world to debunk what he had been promoting so far. It's indeed praiseworthy that Johar is trying to break out of his kind of cinema, as already attested by his endorsement of Lunch Box, last year. Two other names, Anurag Kashyap (who has also penned the dialogues) and Vikramaditya Motwane, who have joined hands with Vivek Agarwal and Johar to produce this film, might give you an idea that Hasee toh Phasee is no run of the mill Bollywood rom-com. Director Vinil Mathew's choice of title, however, seems a tad misleading. Hasee toh Phasee sounds frivolous; but, the film has a profundity which the title doesn't give the slightest inkling of.Nikhil's appeal lies not his looks (as was expected from the devastatingly debonair Sidharth Malhotra), but in his integrity of character. Malhotra subtly downplays his Greek God charm to get into the skin, heart and soul of the character which is truly modern, progressive, yet deeply rooted. No! Not in traditions. Nikhil's strength as well as vulnerability comes from his mature take on relationships and his deep humaneness. And that makes him the most desirable Valentine this year! Meeta's queerness, which strikes you at the very outset, is sustained throughout the film, though she does change into flashy ghaghra-cholis once or twice and dances to typical Punjabi wedding songs. Her difference from other Bollywood rom-com heroines is that her tomboyishness does not come in her way of wooing a man and make him fall in love with her. Meeta, in a way, marks a remarkable transition of the conception of the desirable woman Bollywood has so far projected: she is no Anjali of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), who learns to adopt feminine grace and seductively dance with an unruly anchal flying in the breeze, to win the man of her dreams. The most important twist comes in the end. Watch out for the little epilogue at the airport.While in the entire ensemble cast manages to keep you at raptures all through, it is Parineeti who takes the cake with her comic timing. Sidharth's suavity is in perfect rhythm with Mr. Goodness act he has to put up, and he performs with rare panache. Adah Sharma, the dolled-up heroine of the small screen, brings into her performance the right degree of peevishness in order to appear irritable. The music is a slight letdown, but that does not really matter since this film, unlike other romantic comedies, does not depend on good music to carry forward the plot.One of the best Valentine gifts that have come from the Bollywood stable, Hasee toh Phasee is truly a 'come fall in love' experience, that also marks Hindi cinema's coming of age." 
" Great performance from Parineeti makes this movie beyond just watchable.","It had been a longtime since I opined about a Bollywood movie, the reasons for which happens to be its duration and there was nothing that caught my attention or even the slightest bit of intrigue. So let me just a stretch a bit. Hasee Toh Phasee was something I initially turned my back on thinking its your usual romcom then I decided to give it a chance, just for Parineeti Chopra. It was anything BUT your usual romcom. There were indeed antiques of it from time to time but it was much more enjoyable thanks to the film's slightly artsy production. Unlike the typical Bollywood romcoms 'cheesy' had not been served hot from frame one but as I said there were scenes that constantly reminded you that you were indeed watching one.Parineeti Chopra just steals the show. She'd already proved her talents with her debutante performance in Ladies Vs Ricky Behl and through out her career till date she has done nothing but racked up commendation. She never did really improve. Why? Coz there was no need for improvisation. She was doing the best, bringing her own brand of acting to whichever roles she played in. And in Hasee Toh Phasee's oddball, innocent Meeta, is the more diverse side of her acting we get to see. I haven't seen Sidharth Malhotra's Student of The Year so I had nothing to compare his performance to and I found it a good thing. I was in for Parineeti and I got served but what surprised me was Sidharth as well. Sidharth's Nikhil Bhardwaj, despite his cold steel looks, was convincingly acted out. Special mention goes to the strong supporting cast as well, be it Manoj Joshis performance as the subtle and loving father or Ada Sharma's ab initio knockout-turned-bitch. Brownie points goes to that uncredited actor who plays Nikhil's cousin who breaks out into weird Anu Malik acapellas and twitchy dance moves at the slightest excuse. Scenes with him and Nikhil's paranoid ex-cop dad (played by Sharath Saxena) had me in splits.Vishal Dadlani's music had been spot on, catchy tunes further adorns the romance and festive visuals Be it the funky Shake it Like Shammy or the soothing Zehnaseeb, it goes perfectly in sync with it all. And of course it wouldn't be complete if I don't quote something on Drama Queen track and what more to add than its great to shake a leg.Debutant Vinil Mathews' Hasee Toh Phasee is a modestly entertaining movie but not without flaws. A level of Bollywoodism in certain spots borders on mundane and had it not been there I would have loved it even more. Lets not forget that Hasee Toh Phasee becomes a bit tiresome towards the end what with it being victim to our usual chunk of Bollywood cheesiness. But a lot of heartfelt moments and earnest performances overshadows those, making it a pocket-sized enjoyable one time flick. And if it still doesn't sound appealing, watch it for Parineeti's efficaciously riveting performance." 
" Parineeti Is a Star Shining Brightly","I am not Indian, I just love Bollywood movies. I saw this in Washington DC Feb. 10. Hasee Toh Phasee was one of the very best Bollywood movies I've ever seen (I saw over 50 last year, so I have something to compare!). First, the writer, Harshavardhan Kulkarni, and the director, Vinil Mathews, seem to be new to the industry. It shows—they have created something fresh and different. You can tell the same story a million different ways; it's HOW you tell the story that's important, and they did an excellent job. I hope they keep it up!However, it's clear that this is Parineeti's movie. She shines from beginning to end. She disappears into the role, and like her cousin Priyanka, she is not afraid to portray a character who is less than glamorous. Maybe Priyanka gave her some advice? In any case, she is absolutely brilliant, especially in the comic moments in the first half. The whole audience was laughing over and over. Her timing, her expressions, it was all just perfect. She is a wonderful comic actress, and I hope she does many more comedies--or at least roles with some humor in them, like this one. I have seen all Parineeti's movies so far, and in each one she is better than the last. She has chosen her parts wisely--each time she plays a strong female character who is the centre of the movie. If she is as smart as I think she is, she will continue to do this. (But can Parineeti resist the glamour of being a star? Can she keep her feet on the ground and be the sweet, modest person she appears to be? I hope so!)Sexiest scene of any movie—anywhere—in the last several years? No contest. Siddharth tying the strings of her bare-backed dress. Understated, subtle, but unbelievably powerful and sexy. Whoever had this idea--director, writer, Parineeti, Siddharth, whoever, deserves a special award.Siddharth Malhotra was very good as the straight man, always a hard role in a comedy. The surrounding cast was also excellent. This is not always the case in Bollywood movies since most of them go for exaggerated slapstick humor or melodramatic emotion. Here things were kept in check and seemed realistic and natural.This is a movie I'll watch again and again. I have no doubt that this will become a classic." 
" Cuking Frazy FiLm!!!??>>!!..","A quirky love tale, the story begins with Nikhil (siddharth) a mischievous guy who falls in love with Karishma (adah sharma) at his sister's wedding. Karishma's sister Meeta (parineeti) is a rebellious kind of girl who has issues with her family. With Karishma's request Nikhil arranges for Meeta to stay at his place without her parents' knowledge. Eventually, they both fall in love. What happens after that forms the rest.The director has come up with a romantic storyline and the presentation was rich, the narrative was good.The are dialogues witty . The script was predictable but the screenplay made it interesting. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was impressive. A little editing was needed during the first half, but the second half makes up for it. Costumes were trendy and youthful while the art department was colorful. Siddharth Malhotra has done his part with sensitivity and elegance, he was good. Parineeti Chopra was energetic and has that rugged sex appeal which cannot be missed. Adah is a fine performer. Sharat Saxena was superb, Manoj Joshi was the best, Neena Kulkarni was natural, Sameer Khakkar was standard. Others did their bit as required.This is not one of those regular rom-coms which revolves around a boy meets a girl and they fall in love. This film is very original, its wacky, sad, hilarious, but above all the film is very entertaining, and has a very new feeling to it. Overall, this is a film which would strike a chord with the youth and romance seekers. A must watch in my opinion!!!!" 
" Great Entertainment Movie After long Time in Hindi Cinema","Parineeti & Siddharth both are newcomers & their pair is strange & first time they have done film together. But chemistry between them is really very Interesting that put audiences into their place & forces audiences to think of them. While watching movie you will be fully engaged. Songs are awesome they put at right places & lyrics are similar to what is showing on screen. I think I have never ever watched such a Great Entertainment movie after Shuddh Desi Romance. I become a Great fan of Siddharth & Parineeti after watching this movie.Go for it. Full Marks. Songs & Background music is awesome. Great movie for this Valentine!Different Love Story with Strange Characters." 
" breezy romantic comedy, excellent performances to boot","Make no mistake- even though it is a Karan Johar production, the American Beauty like rose petal filled poster is the only thing unoriginal about Hasee Toh Phasee. Everything else is delightfully authentic, and leaving a gladdening feeling that romantic Hindi cinema has moved beyond trees, songs and weddings.The premise is familiar territory though- two people about to get married, but a third, more interesting party upsets the applecart. There is a wedding here too as the backdrop, but the depiction is unusual. So it is not about Alok Nath inspired happy sanskari episodes, but real problems that rear up during these occasions. So the wedding guests have water problems, there are long lines for the toilets, relatives with whom you cannot converse beyond a hello abound, and cars do get stuck on the road.The lead characters are even more imperfect, but layered enough to sink in your teeth into. Siddharth Malhotra is Nikhil, sensitive, caring yet a financial drain. Parineeti Chopra is Meeta, a misunderstood, quirky yet brilliant scientist with emotional disorders. Both of them have a moment seven years ago, their chemistry evidently crackerjack from that split second (mai idea aur tum meri technology, humeri pa-tang mast udti) and today then meet when Nikhil is marrying Meeta's pampered sister, Karishma (played by a graceful Adah Sharma). Sparks fly, feelings unravel, and a beautifully balanced script takes over. This is no overly done drama, there is plenty of clean humor. Even the guy on phone who solemnly says that dengue mosquitoes bite only in the day, and the romeo in the group that chooses to serenade the lead with one of Anu Malik's abominations are outright hilarious.Meeta is a problem child, forever struggling to handle her own genius. She is a tomboy, a nerd and a drifter who has developed bad habits- like stealing and drug addition, yet she continues to be the apple of her father's eyes. Complementing Meeta's aptitude is Nikhil who is sincere, conscientious but forever struggling to meet expectations. But like people who are destined to be together, when both of them meet, everything begins to fall in place. Meeta is able to overcome her mental disorders and repair her fractured relationships, while Nikhil is able to sort out his professional shortcomings, and also clear his confusion about who he really loves.Parineeti Chopra is absolutely fabulous- she is easily the best young actress in India today. Whether she is making faces or conjuring up inventions, or proposing to Nikhil while on a bus, she brings Meeta alive with innocence, spunk and emotion, and her comic timing is incomparable. Siddharth Malhotra in no longer as wooden as he was in Student of the Year- plays his under confident Nikhil with confidence. Manoj Joshi is excellent, for a change dumping his usual slapstick for poise. Adah Sharma handles a thankless role very well, while Sharad Sharma, Neena Kulkarni, and the rest of the start cast are solid. The songs are breezy just like the movie, while the dialogs by Anurag Kashyap are outstanding.If the Hindi romance genre saw a refreshing change last year with Raanjhaana, Hasee Toh Phasee is just continuing the good work. Lovely characters, real life situations, powerhouse performances, humorous script- everything falls in place with dazzling effect for this Valentine timed romantic comedy. Do not miss- 9/10" 
" A blissful and sweet flick","The movie rides on its cuteness quotient and its amazingly high on that. When I booked the tickets for the movie, I had no expectation from it and looked forward to see some idiot Rom-Com. However, when I came out of the theater - I was pleasantly surprised with what I had seen.I typically look for details in the film and small things matter a lot. There were some loose ends in the script, but by the time movie finished, it was all sorted out. The loose ends are closed in a single line and very subtly, so if you don't pay attention to those things, you might loose the plot or the consistency that this film actually has. Acting is cute - comedy is sweet and relationships are captured the best. You don't see the family in Rom-Coms now-a-days and it was nice to see a full fledged family chemistry in this film. The comedy scenes aren't forced, they just happen and they make you laugh. Imagine a scene where an aunt is serving milk tea, but everyone says that there preference is something else (like coffee, black tea etc). When see reaches to a young man and he is just about to say something, she asks him to just take it. The scene is simple, but it had entire theater burst in laughter. The ACP Pradyuman and Daya scene is cute too. There are many such cute scenes in the film and they just grow on you.Its is a fantastic film and achieves what it wanted to achieve. There are many things to write about, but I leave it to respective watcher to explore in the film. I am not happy with the title of the film. "Hasee to Phasee" denotes a movie where the guys is trying to woo to the girl - there is nothing of that sort in the film for good.I simply loved the cuteness of the film and I'd love to may be watch it again." 
" Not epic, but watchable","The movie has a few flaws. Thing that irritates me the most is when something change suddenly without any reason. Like Parineeti was acting all weird at the start of her character but for no apparent reason all of a sudden starts acting somewhat normal, without any apparent reason, makes you ask why? how come?? Was it because she was in love ??? I give up.That aside, the movie on it's own is watchable and somewhat different. It will definitely appeal to the masses and might just get some attention from the critics. Siddharth in my opinion is a good future prospect. Parineeti has done a good job. The senior actors paid their parts nicely. The surprise package for me was Anil Mange, I think he was brilliant, hats off to him. Songs are appropriate and a few of them will become very popular with the masses. You can watch and enjoy this movie with your family, it may not be the best movie you have seen but will not make you regret watching it either." 
" Worth Watching Movie","I loved the movie not for its story, but for the path-breaking performance by parineeti and Sid, for the chemistry that they shared on screen, for the comedy and drama and for the way the scenes were arranged in the movie. I would give it a 3.5 out of 5. Because the movie is real entertaining. One should watch the movie. its worth spending 150 bucks. And a good performance.

" A big crap!!!","A big disappointment under a big banner. Storyline, direction, acting was as if I am sitting in a theater and a Shakespeare play is going on. This movie passed the message that how unethical and trashy today's youth is. The main female character is playing with his dad emotions and is a junky. The main male character is selling some ideas and trying to collect money from rich people in order to satisfy his fiancé's dreams. Oh come on give me a break. I don't know whether Karan Johar is deprived of any publicity that he came on the screen for few scenes. I will say this movie is a complete rubbish collected from the society. I wont rate this even a single star." 
" Hasee toh Phasee has entertainment quotient attached to it despite having few glitches","Rom-com flicks are one of genre which has not been experimented in Bollywood much lately. Except for decent Gore Teri Pyar Mein last year, Hasee toh Phasee is refreshing change for Indian audiences who have witnessed an overdose of masala films in 2013.Nikhil (Sidharth Malhotra) is getting to married to Karishma( Adah Sharma). Enters the trouble maker Meeta ( Parineeti Chopra) , sister of Karishma, who was caste away from the family for 7 years. In order to keep his marriage procedures smooth, Nikhil must keep away Meeta away from the family but actually falls in love her.Bollywood movies have always been woven around self-realization of whom you actually love ( believe me it happens only during the wedding ceremony) and Hasee Toh Phasee leaves no stone un-turned with typical bollywood potboiler. Screenplay is decent which is gripping in the first half but poor in the 2nd half. Cinematography is outstanding along with powerful art direction. Songs are just about OK. Silver-lining is the entertainment factor which first-time director Vinil Mathew succeeds in achieving. Few hilarious moments will tickle your funny-bone and that is enough to keep the ship sailing. Hats off to Parineeti Chopra for giving a fabulous performance. She is funny, emotes expressively and does a great job overall. Sidharth Malhotra still has a long way to go in terms of acting though he was better than Student of the year. Adah Sharma was looking gorgeous and was good in a small role.Overall, Hasee toh Phasee has entertainment quotient attached to it despite having few problems. Good 3/5https://www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk"
