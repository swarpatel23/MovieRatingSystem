" Simplicity of Malgudi Days",""Welcome to Sajjanpur" is a revival of times on the lines of Malgudi Days and the flavour of of Hrishikesh Mukhejee & Basu Chatterjee. The fictitious village comprises of characters very humane, easily identifiable and oozing with simplicity (well, not quite!). The narrative is extremely smooth and carries you with the flow. Shyam Benegal attempts an unexplored territory and once again he proves what a versatile director he is. With "Welcome to Sajjanpur" Shyam Benegal to a certain degree incorporates commercial elements into his style yet retaining the flavour of parallel cinema. All the characters seem hand-picked as they are perfectly suited to the "T". Every actor gets adequate space as per the demands necessitated by the character. It seemed only Divya Dutta's character/ role was not fleshed out / elaborated (and her participation in the end was kind of coming). In the times of heavy-weights & escapism cinema, "Welcome to Sajjanpur" manages to command a foothold in its own rights. Don't miss this movie at any costs." 
" A Good Satirical Comedy.","This is a rather surprising satirical comedy from a director, cousin of the late and legendary Guru Dutt, who has normally directed classic movies such as "Zubeida" and "Junoon." Mahadev, one of the few educated men, lives in the village of Sajjanpur, which he claims was originally named Doorjanpur until the late Jawaharlal Nehru makes a visit and orders it to be renamed "Sajjanpur." He makes his living by writing songs an stories but the real bread winner is writing letters for the illiterate members of the village, of which one is Kamla, the girl who once, at school gets him into trouble but who he likes.Starring Shreyas Talpade, Amrita Rao, Divya Dutta, Yashpal Sharma, Rajeshwari Sachdeva, Ila Arun and Ravi Kishan. This is directed by Shyam Benegal and written by Shyam Benegal and Ashok Mishra.Shryeas Talpade has proved his talent as an actor who played the role of Shah Rukh Khan's friend in "Om Shanti Om" last year to this one while Amrita Rao has proved that she can play the role of a young girl in love to a matured one living in a village. Divya Dutta just excels in her role herewith a rather surprising impact and there's not much need to say much about her talent as she has shown it before in movies such as "Veer  Zaara." Conclusion: This is a good satirical comedy and is worthwhile watching. However, if one does not like to watch films that are located in a village, then it may not appeal to them and the same goes for those who do not enjoy such comedy genres." 
" A beautiful film","I was also born in a small village like sajjanpur.I usually do not watch many bollywood films but this film is most beautiful and realistic film I have ever watched.It is nicely directed by Shyam Benegal and all the actors and actresses have played nicely specially Shreyas Talpade and Amrita Rao. Shryeas Talpade is a very talented actor. I would also like to mentioned the music of this film which is melodious! it is really great. Conclusion: This is a very nice film and is worthwhile watching I will give 9 out of 10 for this film and wish that bollywood could make more film like this in future." 
" Welcome Back Shyam Benegal","After taking a break from direction for about 7 years, one of my all time favourite directors is back and this time with something different: a satirical comedy. 'Welcome to Sajjanpur' is such a joy to watch. It isn't an out-and-out comedy as there are elements of tragedy but the film feels refreshing and genuine. When most Hindi movies nowadays are set in foreign locations, 'Welcome to Sajjanpur' is set in a fictitious Indian village and it tells the humble story of the inhabitants of that village. I don't recall Benegal ever having made a comedy and here he succeeds greatly. The sharp writing consists of some hilariously witty dialogues, rich and sincere characters and laugh-out-loud situations. I enjoyed all the letter-writing sequences with the colourful characters. Benegal also cleverly presents themes such as politics, 'gay' rights and widow remarriage into the plots. The songs too fit well with the story although the dream sequence filmed on Talpade and Rao in an airplane is awkward.The performances are splendid. Ila Arun and Divya Dutta are awesome as the conflicting mother-daughter duo. Amrita Rao is marvelous as the married village belle. Ravi Kishan finally gets to display his comic talents in a substantial role. Rajeshwari Sachdev is impressive in a small role. She's particularly funny in the scene where her father-in-law asks her to read the letter from Ramkumar. Yashpal Sharma is adequate. Kunal Kapoor thankfully only has a teeny role.And, 'Welcome to Sajjanpur' is confidently carried by Shreyas Talpade, one of the most talented young actors of the current generation. Benegal's previous films indicate that he has an eye for talented actors and he has cleverly cast Talpade in the lead role. The actor delivers a finely balanced and very natural performance.I can safely add 'Welcome to Sajjanpur' to my list of favourite films of the year and so far it is one of the best Hindi films of 2008. If you're looking for an something in the form of good entertainment, innovative storytelling with some interesting themes and good cinema, then this is that movie." 
" Superbbbbbbbbbbbbbb Movie","Oh, what a movie! I just finished watching it and I cant think anything bad about this movie. Actors, location, script, music and .... the tremendously talented director.I cannot imagine how did Shyam Benegal turned such a simple rural story into such a entertaining masterpiece! Yeah, I have not watched much of his movies, which is kind of a sin, I know. But, now that I have seen this, I will surely watch all the others.The story is about a mostly illiterate village, where our hero Mahadev (Shreyas Talpade) is an educated but unestablished person, who writes and reads letters for people. In this strange occupation, he meets several dimensional persons, such as a superstitious mother of an unmarried girl, an illiterate but benevolent politician, a do-gooder eunuch, a love-struck compounder and the most desired: his childhood crush who is waiting for her husband to come from Mumbai.Mr Benegal skillfully displayed all of the grayish characters throughout the movie, including our hero. Though the main theme is comedy, the film slowly starts touching into your spines by resembling any of our lives, any normal Indian's life.I could have gone describing the complete story, but I would really like you guys to go and watch the movie yourself, its like a fantasy story revealing itself slowly to be as normal as any other normal human being.Kudos, Shyam Benegal." 
" Great to have Shyam Benegal back","It's great to have Shyam Benegal back making films again. He's relaunched himself with a fairly light film, one that reminded me of another of my favorite directors of the 80s, Sai Paranjpe. Both Sai and Shyam are so good at capturing the quirks of village life, warts and all. Welcome To Sajjanpur actually does have some dark elements, but the director doesn't seem to want to ruin India Shining's cheery mood by dwelling on these too much. Be warned, a lot of the language in this film is Bhojpuri, especially the dialogs of Ila Arun. I missed a lot of her funny lines, but the Bhojpuri speaking people in the audience were laughing out loud. The performances of the actors were all great - Shyam is obviously good at casting. Don't know if this film is destines to run for long, so I'd advise everyone to go out and see it right away. Or you could always wait to see it on TV (UTV Spotboy movies make it to TV in 3 months) or buy the DVD (for Rs 50!)." 
" This is not a Comedy! Watch it if you enjoy fine storytelling!","For a movie maker of the caliber of Shayam Benegal is, it goes without saying with his invite to Sajjanpur comes along a bouquet of expectations. The only other movie of his that I’ve seen is Zubaidaa and I was amazed at his story telling quality! This time, the setting is rustic with characters from a usual random village. The film is presented as a slice of life from the perspective of the protagonist than a story with a beginning and end.Mahadev, the only degree holder in Sajjanpur nurses ambitions to be a novel writer someday, but fate has sealed him to writing letters for the illiterate village folk who come to him not just for his knowledge of the letter but also for his ability to write with that extra zing and passion that makes the letters work. Playing the protagonist, Shreyas Talpade gets the largest of movie pie that he executes with brilliance without going overboard.Our writer’s clientèle takes us through the minds of the varied village folk. It ranges from his childhood crush Kamla (Amrita Rao) who writes to her far away husband, a mother (Ila Arun) worried about her vibrant daughter’s (Divya Dutta) horoscope, a compounder (Ravi Kishan) who is deeply in love with the young widow Shobharani (Rajeshwari Sachdev), the villainous ex-Sarpanch Ramlal (Yashpal Sharma) and a Eunuch too.The next couple of hours, which at times feels somewhat stretched, give us a glimpse of their lives. Mahadev is good at heart and does well to others, but he secretly tries to misread letters to Kamla thinking that he may have a chance if her husband went away. Ramlal tries his best to connive against the Eunuch Munnibai to ensure it doesn’t win the local elections. As is life, in the end, it’s happy for some sad for others.Throughout the movie, its poignant moments are interspersed so delicately that you don’t feel any character being out of place. The best in my opinion is when Mahadev learns the truth about Kamala’s husband’s life, where Shreyas’ flowing emotions are so well portrayed. Then there is the scene of Munnibai getting a letter written seeking protection. For one, the music is not memorable and the seeming length may bother.The characters of Sajjanpur are both simpletons at times and wise in the ways of the world when necessary. The movie makes a point on various serious social issues including land acquisitions for industrialization, struggle of the poor and fall into organ trade, widow remarriage, superstitions, job worry for the educated and many more. If you don’t mind the lack of typical stories and climaxes, this story is surely worth watching." 
" Good Comedy !","This was a nice surprise. I saw it because of Shyam Benegal's direction. The movie is well made, good jokes and comedy.The story line was good, acting by everyone was commendable. Shreyas will turn up to be the best in sometime. His comedy and timing was so realistic.The script and screenplay was just too good i feel.Shyam Benegal should come up with more such themes. He has a good knack for comedy.I would recommend it. Watch it for a good laugh.I would rate it 7." 
" Really you can enjoy!!!!","Yes this is a good movie and worth watching. Here Shyam Benegal gave a good message of democracy and need of literacy with a good comedy essence. Shreyas Talpade really acted well as in Om Shanti Om and Iqbal. He proved his talent as a potential actor. Amritha Rao , Divya Datta, Ila Arun excellent in their performance.I liked the language they used in this movie. It is really nice. One more hing I would like to tell about music which is melodious and location no second opinion! it is too good. Shyam Benegal showed his creative mind with very simple,watchful,movie. he is a master of Indian Cinema." 
" Well made comedy by Benegal","Nice comedy set up completely in the rural India, with jokes that make good sense in the local dialect which should not be difficult to comprehend. Ace director Shyam Benegal has made a perfect movie, albeit quite different from the serious classics he has directed in the past. Shreyas Talpade as the aspiring novelist ends up being a scribe, and therefore has a peek into everyone's lives in the village. Ends up manipulating people's lives through letters, especially his love interest's. Quite a number of funny sub plots follow, and the humor doesn't let you feel they are getting too many to remember. A few melodious numbers add to the movie." 
" Way to go, Mr Benegal","This film is a treat to watch and in recent times one of the very few films which leave a beautiful after taste in the mouth long after the titles have been displayed. This film is a creation so rare, displaying a fine balance between satire, ridicule, humour and all the while making the viewer aware of the dark side of life. Many aspects of the film bear the stamp of the Master that Mr Benegal is, and like a rare wine , he has only kept improving with the passage of years. The acting is first rate, with Shreyas Talpade carrying the film through on his capable shoulders, ably supported by most of the other cast. The editing is crisp and never does any sequence appear in any way out of the cohesive well knit fabric of human lives which make up Sajjanpur. Its an amazing film and should deserve many more accolades and International recognition than what has been received by it.It is a shame that it has not been nominated for the Oscars or the Golden Globe." 
" Absolutely Brilliant!","I created an IMDb.com account just so I could rate this movie a 10! Its an amazing movie, I watched it twice and was rolling with laughter even the second time I watched it! That being said, it would be a flaw to call this movie just a comedy. There are definitely elements of tragedy and satire in it. Without giving any of the plot of the movie away, let me just say that it is a brilliant movie, certainly one of the best movies I have ever watched. The actors are brilliant, the story is fantastic and is well strung together around the protagonist, a humble letter writer. The protagonist himself displays shades of gray. And this movie is far from the typical "... and they lived happily every after" kinda fairy tales. It does not venture too far from reality (yeah, no US presidents flying fighter planes, shooting down aliens, or unbelievable actors splitting bullets into two, or couples dancing in flimsy clothes on frozen mountain peaks) and thats one of the most endearing qualities of this movie. Highly recommended!" 
" Simple story telling with lot of twists.","Welcome to Sajjanpur is from one of the India's most experienced director Shyam Benegal. In times where people go to see well advertised movies, world of glamor and glitz here is a movie which challenges the Bollywood trend of running behind Khans, Roshans, Bachans and heavy budgets. What's distinctive about this movie is simple story telling, exceptional direction, and a team of actors who have lived their character. With a simple village theme the movie talks about a failed novel writer who changes the lives of many characters simply by writing letters on their behalf. He also realizes some of his mistakes and overcomes them. The movie always makes you wonder what's going to happen next. Hindi movie industry would need more movies like this to breed good directors, actors. The movie also light heartedly criticizes Indian politics; it creates some unbelievable twists to the story. The movie is full of fun, energy, simplicity and twist. I would give 10 out of 10 for this movie." 
" With love, from Sajjanpur...","As an actor, Shreyas Talpade, has exceeded my expectations every time I have seen him perform on the screen. "Welcome to Sajjanpur" in true sense is a welcome break for Bollywood, which now a days is churning out comedies which are more non-sense than light-hearted. Of course Mr.Benegal's class is very evident from each and everyone of the characters he as presented in this story.WTS is a simple story of an arts graduate, Mahadev (Shreyas) who's new found talent of writing letters is an instant hit with the villagers. Parallely, he evolves into a writing consultant with such an élan that even a guy in love gets his love-letter written from Mahadev. There are a number of very funny people, with a variety of problems coming to him for having their letters written and the way events turn due to his thoughtful letters are truly engrossing. Ila Arun's character was the best among the supporting roles and I couldn't help laughing out mad at the climax of the movie.Phew! very few movies like this stand up to the class of yesteryear comedies (Read Hrishikesh classics). 07/10 Don't miss this movie." 
" Nice Comedy and drama movie with good story","Acting is good by actors, nice direction
