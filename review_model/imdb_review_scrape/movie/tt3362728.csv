" Interesting in parts!","'Ungli' has a good premise & to an extent, it does justice to it. But, overall, the Writing Material, despite its noble & genuine intentions, doesn't work entirely. Its interesting in parts, not totally.'Ungli' Synopsis: A gang of friends decide to take justice into their own hands & turn into vigilantes. Things take a turn when a cop goes undercover to grill them. 'Ungli' makes an honest attempt to take upon the burning issue of corruption that exists in our country even today. The film begins well & the 'Ungli' Gang give us some gripping sequences, but the pace drops as soon as the Cop enters the scene. The second-hour doesn't hold appeal & the culmination looks hurried. Despite a crisp running-time of 113-minutes, 'Ungli' still isn't able to rise above its flaws. Rensil D'Silva's Screenplay works in bits & pieces. A much tighter second-hour was needed. Milan Zaveri's dialogue, however, are super. D'Silva's Direction is ordinary. Cinematography & Editing are mention-worthy. Music by Various Artists is tuneful.Performance-Wise: Sanjay Dutt delivers a restrained performance. Emraan Hashmi is sincere, although the length of his role is surprisingly short in the first-hour. Randeep Hooda is ever-effective. Kangana Ranaut doesn't get much to do. She looks gorgeous, though. Angad Bedi & Neil Bhoopalam are fair. Neha Dhupia is passable.On the whole, 'Ungli' is a half-baked fare." 
" A very good effort in trying out something different but 2nd half makes it a spoilsport","It was Rang De Basanti which ignited the fire within the common man to fight against corruption and turned out to be an event film . UNGLI had all the ingredients that makes it a perfect hard- hitting flick but 2nd half spoils the mood and it is a like a matar paneer without salt.Plagued by corruption arising in every part of the society, 4 friends form a group called UNGLI to fight against it in their own way.After bold attempt in Kurbaan , Renzil D'Silva does a fine a job as a director. However the screenplay looses the steam aftermath. The beginning of the film and narration of story of the protagonist is beautifully depicted . The later reel flips and falls flat heavily with unnecessary song and less-impacting climax. Screenplay could have been better. Dialogues are good. Editing required extra effort. Cinematography and art direction is bad. Among the actors, only Randeep Hooda stands out while none could make impact with their performance. Emraan Hashmi is as usual wooden face. It is high-time he should start looking for better roles. Kangana Raunat fails to make impact this time. Sanjay Dutt is OK. Overall , a very good effort in trying out something different but 2nd half makes it a spoilsport. Average 2/5" 
" A film on the fight with corruption with new concept & climax.","After a long time, finally Ungli movie has been released. In which we can see little bit younger Emran, Kangna & Hooda. While Sanjay Dutt is looking very old. Neha Dhupiya & Neil Bhopalam (24 fame) are also here. Shradhha Kapoor is in Dance basanti song and Mahesh Manjrekar & Raza Murad have special appearances. This film describes the fight by the Mango People (Aam Admi) to the corruption, directed by Rensil D'Silva. Story is nice and new. Ploting of emotions and songs are also admirable. One of the plus points is dialogues by Milan Milap Zaveri. Some are too funny, while some are having a perfect punch to hit hearts of the audience. Music is cool and listenable. Sachin-Jigar's Dance Basanti is nice. Paakezah is my favorite. Background score is okay. Sanjay has played his character well. Others have small roles or I can say nothing extraordinary. So, all are fine as per the film, not individually. Kangana looks innocent with her curly hair. Emran and Randeep act as usual. Rensil has directed the film nicely. Some point of time, it is little bit slow and boring. Concept is new. Even climax is also remarkable. But, I felt some portions slow. If that portions could have been faster, the film will become a marvelous one. Although it is a nice workpiece, but box-office collections will not be higher than 50-60 cr. I would suggest this film to the youth of our country. It's not a predicting movie, I'm sure you will enjoy it from starting to ending. You will get more than your expectations." 
" Better but could have been best","Story A bunch of four, Abhay (Randeep), Maya (Kangana), Goti (Neil) and Kalim (Angad) after an unfortunate incident create a vigilante gang called the Ungli gang. Plagued with corruption, in every faction, every strata of the system, the gang picks up momentum and people's love by a series of action. But soon enough they find a fan replicating what they do and an application to join the gang. Everyone is skeptical of Nikhil (Emraan) who poses as a law student but is actually an undercover cop, on duty to expose the Ungli gang. Nikhil has their smarts and sharpness. But, Nikhil too believes in their ways. Will he take them to task or join their movement?Performance Emraan Hashmi is great. Donning his wicked smile, he plays a lackadaisical cop who finds his real calling in changing the system when he associates with the Ungli Gang. He brings out Nikhil's dilemma of being torn between what's right and what's not. There is a simmering intensity in Nikhil no one except Emraan could have brought out.Following up close is Randeep Hooda, who is robust and never over the top in this film. He is great in every frame and with the same grit.Sanjay Dutt shot his last scene with them and he still has his iconic punch to his persona. I miss watching mode of Munnabhai and such roles and the little stint in Ungli will make you crave for it.Kangana Ranaut, Neil Bhopalan, Angad Bedi were all great in their parts. Kangana does not have a very meaty role in the film but she is radiant and great in the scenes she has.Direction & screenplay Films like Ungli are never about its actors but about its director and its writing. Rensil makes a compelling film which doesn't shy away from taking on the system, much like his dreaded gang. Ungli prides itself in being a cross between a formulaic entertainer and relevant cinema and it makes for an interesting watch. The only times Rensil loses tempo is when the film's melodrama steps in. Luckily not enough time or energy is wasted on that. It's a slow boiling thriller that doesn't have the darkness of Kurbaan, which was again a fantastic watch, but tackles it all with intelligent humor. The punches in Ungli have a certain sincerity, that flows from the film's goodness and novelty. I am so bored of watching potboilers that Ungli is a whiff of freshness that has an enticing narrative which will keep you interested all through. And when you try predicting, Rensil's climax will brilliantly throw you off. What's another sparkling part of Ungli is its theme songs and Neeti's voice will resound every time the gang accomplishes a mission.The last wordI think it's putting too much of a responsibility on a film to instigate a social change. It's job is to primarily entertain and make better cinema. Ungli's novelty is its highlight point. Benefitting from sharp writing, lucid narrative and a few clapworthy zingy dialogues which have the punch, I do think Ungli is one of 2014â€²s most novel concepts. Well rendered and acted with zeal, don't miss five people showing an entire system, the finger. I am going with 7/10." 
" Go For This Ungli Gang","After the very famous and popular TV series 24:India Renzil D'Silva is coming with Ungli and i must say he truly deserves thumbs up for the screenplay and story.Sometimes its hard to plot a story very well with a social message but Renzil has done a superb job.A special appreciation to Milap Zaveri for his dialogs and very good punches.Undoubtedly Emraan Hashmi is superb as cop and as Ungli gang member.He is perfect for this role for dialog delivery as well as acting and attitude.Sanjay Dutt is as always nice in every scene.Randeep Hooda surprisingly awesome this time.Kangana Ranaut,Neha Dhupia,Angad Bedi,Kader Khan and Arunoday Singh have done nice job too.4 people make ungli gang just for justice of common people when their friend who is Kangana Ranaut's brother been a victim of injustice.Inspector Kaali put Nikhil to catch them.But due to some circumstances they both shake hands with ungli gang and exposed the whole corrupt system.Overall,don't think and just go watch movie.Its a another superb movie delivered from Emraan and surprisingly from Karan Johar.RECOMMENDED !!" 
" An uninterestingly executed weird attempt wasting a socially relevant subject.","The first reaction one has in mind after watching UNGLI is that the film must have been in the making for a long time with certain production issues, as it talks about an already overused theme quite shabbily and has a very uninterestingly executed progression without any great involvement of its writer and director. Moreover it has all cameo kind of appearances of many known names who have nothing great to do in their limited scenes and thus make no impact whatsoever on the viewers in less than two hours of duration including few mediocre songs.Stating its only merits, UNGLI begins well with a hard hitting realistic scene and then has an innovative animated title sequence featuring a song calling for social awakening through 'A Respected Aadarniye Ungli'. It comes to the point in the first 10 minutes only and therefore raises your expectations with such quick developments on the screen wasting no time on introductions. However a poor item song with a guest appearance of Shraddha Kapoor pulls the film down and then it fails to pick up any further in the subsequent reels offering a pretty stale, outdated and illogical project taking a lot for granted. A love angle (with Neha Dhupia) is inserted in its storyline just for the sake of it as usual and nothing works in the favour of this weak attempt made despite all the good intentions of its socially relevant subject suggesting a revolutionary solution taking the law in hands to fight with corruption.With an interval at just 55 minutes and a laughable sequence in its climax along with few unwanted songs, UNGLI gives you nothing as compared to the expectations raised in the beginning and one keeps wondering why actors such as Emraan Hashmi, Randeep Hooda, Kangna Ranaut, Mahesh Manjrekar and Sanjay Dutt said yes to the film to play all under-developed characters in only few scenes appearances full of many clichÃ©d moments. The background score & editing tries its best to give the movie some pace. But nothing is successful in hiding the truth that the film had been in the making for the last two years and most probably had gone through many changes and re-touchings too, resulting in a complete 'no-show' in the end to say it all.So try to avoid UNGLI this week since its nothing but another of those mistakes of a big production house made out of their sheer over- confidence using an in-house team/director trying to take advantage of the present questionable social conditions prevalent in the country." 
" Everyone put your UNGLI's in the Air, F**K a corrupt system!!!","Abhay (Randeep Hooda), Goti (Neil Bhoopalam), Maya (kangna) and Kaleem (Angad Bedi) are friends who form a gang to punish the corrupt system and its officials. In no time, they expand their antics and put their achievements on the internet. The police brings in a honest cop Ashok Kale (sanjay dutt) to catch the gang and he in turn gives this job to Nikhil (emraan) who hates the system but is very talented in catching culprits. What happens from there forms the rest.The director has come up with a message oriented storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was gripping and breezy. The dialogues were well written. The script was average but the screenplay made it better. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was sharp. Costumes were stylish and well designed while the art department was natural. Sanjay Dutt was superb, Emraan Hashmi was excellent, Kangna was nice, Angad Bedi was apt, Neil Bhoopalam was natural. The one to watch out for is Randeep Hooda, he is a revelation. Neha Dhupia was highly seductive, Shiv was neat. Others did their bit as required and added value.The idea of coming up with a theme to fight against the system is quite old but it has enough potential to appease the audience if packaged rightly. In this film, the first half breezes off smoothly without any hiccup and the interval bang is also interesting. But the second half brings down the momentum and few scenes that were Melo dramatic but paces picks up before the climax, and the climax is great . Overall, this film is told in a simple manner, the film may have some hiccups, but all withstanding the film never gets too preachy or serious, it talks about a serious topic, in a entertaining, and funny way. Its a noble attempt, and i recommend you watch Ungli its entertaining and talks over serious problem we all face a corrupt system. A welcome change from the masala entertainers seen each week. 3.5/5* or 7/10" 
" A welcome take on corrupted India","I didn't really have much expectations of Ungli. The trailers looked okay, but it didn't give much away and didn't really excite me but the film really does surprise and is very much worth the watch. Ungli is all about corruption in India, which is by no means a new story line but its portrayed quite nicely in this film. While there is nothing 'outstanding' about the film, and its not likely to come close to any box office records it's one of those films that is a good family film - without an obvious genre. Performance wise it's really a group effort. Randeep Hooda has a lot more screen time in the first half, but Emraan Hashmi in the second. Sanjay Dutt is pretty much the main character throughout the film and does a stellar job of a role that is very easy for him. Randeep yet again puts in a brilliant performance and is now such a reliable actor. It's quite clear that he isn't a mainstream hero, but as a supporting actor he is one of the best in the industry. Emraan is his charming self, and it's quite nice for him to do a film which contains no obvious romance. Kangna and the others do well in their respective roles too. The music is catchy and suits the film well. I'm quite happy that the songs weren't randomly pushed in requiring the actors to actually sing, but more in the background which suited the film. Dance Basanti is very catchy (Shraddha looks fantastic!), Auliya and Pakeezah are both beautiful. Overall the film is a good watch but nothing amazing. Watch it for Randeep and Emraan." 
" Idea was realistic but execution was typical fictional","There is no story. It gives feeling of episodic compilation of some common problems, faced by public. No connection between all incidents. Dialogues by Milan Milap Zaveri, are very good. Starting 15 minutes, film sounds good but as it progresses, it takes downward journey only. I support this type of idea or issue based film, so I am positively biased with this type of film and cursing myself to write against it but I am helpless. It is at least better than all that craps who don't have anything to tell and execution remains bad too. Makers believe that a blind person can't recognize anyone because in a scene Randeep Hooda talks to his love interest with mask, even for few minutes but she was unable to recognize him!!? Can Deepawali heavy crackers erupt the road!? This road was erupted in night but remains same in next day being it is very important to one of a powerful person!!? Climax could have been very interesting and innovative but having the germs they could not make it even good. It is bad actually. Everything has taken for granted that this have to happen so it happened. Love interest was not required at all. There are lots of contradiction of the statement and behavior of main characters. They use masks to hide their identity and then also resist a person who does the work like them only and shockingly they were very much concerned about their image, when they are just mask man then if anyone does good job using mask it would have been fine for them. They are not doing a business so they oppose a same stuff doing rival. Few scenes are good but unrealistic. The running in stadium and the traffic police scene are good but again presentation was pushy. Performance wise lots of good actors are nothing to do. Surprisingly Randeep Hooda is very good. Sanjay Datt, Emran Hashmi, Kangana Ranuat and Neha Dhupiya is just OK. Music is good." 
" The movie could have been a lot better","â€ªâ€ŽStoryâ€¬ :- 1st of all this type of movie is common in Bollywood Protest against Corruption but the unique thing is the type of protest like 2 police men taking "Rishwat" so they forced them to eat money or like auto drivers are not going for small distance, so they sent him to delhi via luggage train etc etc.. But the story is predictable as u can predict what is going to happen next â€ª#â€ŽDirectionâ€¬ :- Poor Rensil D'Silva is a great script writer but not a great director the movie could have been more good if the direction was good The was lots of potential in the story but he failed to take advantage of the story â€ª#â€ŽScreenplayâ€¬ :- Good enough but direction made it look really disappointing â€ª#â€ŽActingâ€¬ :- Emraan Hashmi, Sanjay Dutt, Randeep Hooda was awesome like they always are There was nothing much for Kangana to do except 4 dialogues & shooting video, Neha Dhupia was also there to deliver 3- 4 dialogues.. Neil Bhoopalam as Goti over-acted.. Angan Bedi as Kalim was OKâ€ª#â€ŽSongsâ€¬ :- Dance Basanti great other songs are also good for time passLastly, if you are Emraan Hashmi fan then go for it" 
" Fails in the middle overs","Ungli starts off really well. There is nothing new in the plot. The characters are quite fresh and look appropriate for there roles. The incidents happen quite quickly and you will the movie will be a racy thriller. Sadly, it starts to falter after first 20 minutes and then it just drags along. There is nothing in the movie which takes you by surprise and it becomes quite boring towards the end. Acting wise Randeep Hooda, Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi have done reasonably well. Emraan Hashmi and Kangana Ranaut are wasted.There was no need for Sanjay Dutt and anyone could have played that role. The songs are not needed and just bore you. Overall, Ungli turns out to be a carbonated drink which fizzes out as soon as you open the bottle !" 
" UNGLI : Too far-fetched","In Ungli, four friends,instigated by a tragic incident and invigorated with the denial of justice,take law into their hands by turning into vigilantes.This theme might have germinated from Rang De Basanti whose screenplay was co-written by director Rensil Desilva who sensitized us with his recalcitrance in that 2006 runaway hit.The idea might seem interesting, but Rensil offers quite a implausible solution to the mammoth-shaped problem that has plagued our society - corruption.A crime reporter working for a hotshot TV Channel(Randeep Hooda), a medical intern(Kangana), a techie(Neil Bhoopalan) and a garage mechanic(Angad Bedi)join hands to dispense justice to the common man by taking into tasks the corrupt entities in our system.Together, they form the 'Ungli' gang, a metaphor for 'balls to the inefficient system and law' who punish the corrupt bureaucrats, local politicians, arrogant auto-rickshaw wallas in innovative ways,without being violent.Their masked-vigilantism goes viral with each of their accomplishments being video-taped by themselves and sent to media and grabs everyone's eyeballs causing agony to the police department.Enter ACP Kale(Sanjay Dutt)to nab these 'criminals' before they are idolized like Batman of Gotham city!And soon he realizes that to track them , you gotta think like them.Kale appoints the cop with a notorious streak, Nikhil(Emraan Hashmi) who infiltrates the gang, but later finds himself struggling with the predicament of dutifulness and conscientious action.Without delving into the details of the protagonists, Rensil who has also scripted the story, takes the narrative at a break-neck speed providing the piping-hot vignettes of the Ungli gang's operations.Though it appears too smooth and simplistic, its the fun and quirk quotient that keeps us hooked.Equally entertaining are the corny dialogues (Milap Zaveri) and witty one-liners which are written only to garner whistles and they are pun-intended when you see them uttered by Hashmi and Dutt. Sample this - When Hashmi's character says to Dutt, "I want you to be back in the business",he retaliates sarcastically "Meri Billi mujhi se miwaaon!" Some of the portions are ignored conveniently, like the budding romance between Hashmi and Kangana and some subplots, like Hooda pursuing the sexy news reporter played by Neha Dhupia,are given too much of importance,ultimately diluting the impact.What goes against the film is the climax which is too convenient for a finale and devoid of an anticipated hard- hitting tone.The entire cast does a good job here, specially Randeep Hooda who emotes according to the pulse of any sequence.Kangana Ranaut is sadly relegated to the background, and I wished she had a more meaty role.Emraan Hashmi appears too tired and uninterested to be in the familiar character space while Dutt exudes commendable screen presence even with a salt-n-pepper hairdo and drooling eyes.The camaraderie's in the gang is spot-on which adds to the film's strengths.On the whole, Ungli is a feel-good entertainer which doesn't make you leave the theater with a heavy heart but you will certainly retrospect - wasn't it too far-fetched an idea ! It has got its heart at the right place but finger on the wrong pulse. Rating : 2.5/5" 
" Likable mostly BUT not totally","It was Clear from the start that we cant expect a Rang De Basanti or A Wednesday type of breathtaking concept from Ungli in-spite of the fact that it has been directed by Rensil who had co wrote the script of Rang De Basanti..... The Concept of the movie was novel ,, but the movie is not breathtaking.....But never the less ,,is still better then unnecessary remake who knock every Friday to make us fool..... The movie took some close to common person corruption problems and tackle with them with some comical ways which are although not realistic solution but nice to watch..... Randeep Hooda has not been kept as a side kick ,, which i liked a lot as the trailer showed that Emraan Will be the main lead.... As much of acting concerned i only find Randeep to be interesting....About Sanjay Dutt he was totally over the top , with lots and lots of bad dialog ,, its like all the bad dialogs have been given to Sanjay only..... I cant even differentiate when Sanjay plays a cop and when he plays a Criminal ,, because he acts same in both cases..... Neil and Angad were not bad in there character but just they have not got much chance to show there talent.....Don't know why Kangana has selected such a small and uninteresting role ,, even Neha Dhupia (who was not at all there in the trailer) has a better role as compared to Kangana...... Start of the movie was great ,, and up to interval it was all good.....But after interval when everything become personal to our Ungli gang it became little uninteresting up to when a nice climax came....... So its the unfocused second half which made the movie a average one.....For some time the movie was totally out of the track.....Fighting with corruption has been kept aside .... Mumbai police has been shown too dumb as the Ungli Gang was doing all of there jobs without any problem that also too easily..... There were also some good actors who are wasted in too small roles..... Still A good movie ,, but could have been better...... Lastly its my personal request to Sradhaa Kapoor ,, please don't do anymore item songs ,, its spoils your CUTENESS which is the best thing in you.... 6.4/10 By ANuP APu KuMaR........" 
" the definition of time pass","watch this movie if you literally have nothing (better) to do. Its neither exciting, nor boring. At least it knows that and doesn't stretch for too long like how Hindi movies usually do. There are a few laughs in there but its mostly the audience laughing at the horribly dated dialogs. yecch !! There even exists a love angle between two characters which seems to only exist to give way to a song. and then its gone. wot m8?! The movie tackles the issue of citizens standing up against corruption in our awesome country. The last time I saw this as a theme was Rang De Basanti and that was a movie that sparked conversation. This leaves nothing with you. But to be fair the movie does point fingers (and about time) at something other than politicians for a change. And it does have some nice moments too.It was good to see Reema Lagoo and %&$%#@ after a very long time. Randeep Hooda and Emraan Hashmi are good. Sanjay Dutt doesn't bring anything to the table (and the dude looks tired) and I personally have always found Kangana Ranaut's talking very weird (maybe I should watch queen). Did I mention the hilariously shitty dialogs? The Item number is shitty and so is Shraddha Kapoor but at least the song doesn't stretch beyond a minute or two. Neha Dhupia will always have a special place in my hard drive. She always manages to turn me on (call me!). Her acting isn't bad at all but its just that she doesn't have a.. um.. meaty role.you cant call it good cinema. its entertainment at best and that too mild. A story like this usually makes you think but I believe the movie makers know that the nation has thought about this issue enough and countless times and so it focuses on taking action. sadly its not able to convince the audience that they can do it too. but perhaps thats asking too much.usually movies suffer from a lack of an interesting ending. But in this case the ending seemed apt. no excitement was necessary and they kept it that way. The title sequence is animated and I have to say it was very slow (slow character animation, lack of camera movement) and boring to someone who notices these things. This is something I've noticed with Indian animation studios as compared to stuff from American studios. my 2 cents on that.worst part: Dem dialogs (and a particular one delivered by Kangana)best part: Sanjay Dutt saying "Kaanoon Se Barda Koi Nahi Hota" (or something of that sort)" 
" A new concept","After a long time bollywood had made an entertaining film on a new concept.It feels true as we all are a part of this corrupt system which has been depicted in the movie.The main question is that who is responsible for this?I think it is among one of the toughest questions which should be debated.Corruption is the most common but very sensitive topic.Rensil dealt with this topic in a very sincere manner.The film never depicts over the top and always revolves around real situations.The screenplay was very slick.It was written very well.It revolved around the common problems we face everyday so it gave a feel of reality.No doubt it contained some loopholes but they could be forgiven as the screenplay was very tight and never let you to blink your eyes.Performance of Emraan hashmi was good.He delivered what he should have done.Randeep was good and his dialogue delivery was really nice.Sanjay dutt looked out of the form and Kangna was like a showpiece.Rest of the cast was average.Music of this movie was disappointing.Except Dance basanti every track was bad.Some dialogues were funny while some where too filmy.Overall this movie is made on a new concept and the concept is universal.A watchable movie especially for youngsters.... RATING : 6.9 out of 10 as the music was too bad" 
" Good message bit filmy but watchable","Sanjay Dutt before his arrest in 2013 had several films left incomplete, This film was 80% complete but was completed before he went to jail but delayed in release. The film brings together Randeep Hooda, Emraan Hashmi,Kangana Ranaut.etc The film has a nice message to society and is well handled, at times too filmy yet the film is well handled. The problems faced by people are very believable, at times the director does take the predictable route yet nonetheless the film keeps you engrossed.Direction by Renzil Dsilva after Kurbaan is good Music is decent, Basanti is a hit song already, Shraddha Kapoor does shake her belly well, other songs are good tooAmongst the cast Emraan Hashmi does a superb job in his role as always, Randeep Hooda too is fab, Neil Bhoopalam is good, Kangana ranaut gets less scope but does well, Neha Dhupia is good in her role, Raza Murad is good too Arunoday Singh has a brief role and is okay Sanjay Dutt essays his role well as always though he looks very tired,out of shape and old, also in a few scenes his voice is dubbed by someone else(though the film is shot in sync sound). Mahesh Manjerekar is good in a brief role, others are all good"
