" Never seen such an awful and loud movie.","Please do not waste your time. I feel bad how come an actress like Rekha can be part of this movie. Sherman Joshi does not know acting. It is loud that it just has no effect on you. Story idea is good, but the materialization of the story Is worst than a t.v. drama. Director was not in a mood to make a movie. Other actors like Anupam Kher and Mr. Kapoor are totally wasted. So if you want to watch it for sake of Rekha, it is at your own risk. We left the movie halfway. I wish bollywood can do better. In the future, I will have to think twice before going for my next movie. OK, I have nothing much to say that it was a waste of time." 
" Awful acting and badly made","Really good story but the way the show it , the direction and the acting was so awful it was painful to watch" 
" Great movie","It's been a very long time since I last saw a movie which is both entertaining and teaches good family values. The story shows the importance of mothers and the sacrifices they make for their families. I admit not everyone is lucky in life to get a good mother, but it's nice to see what a good mother should be like. Family films like Pardes and KKKG go over the top and show Indian and Western culture in such stupid ways. It was refreshing to watch this movie which combines both eastern and western things in a good way. Rekha's performance and beauty was superb, and Sharman was amazing too. It was good to see Anupam Kher given a solid and truly supportive role. The only thing I thought was out of place was Shweta Kumar's dance in the temple - good dance moves, but less of a bhajan and more of a college performance." 
" Its a great movie! Must Watch! All about Respecting Your Mother","Its a wonderful movie, which shows the life of a typical Indian mother, Bharti (played by Rekha). They sacrifice their hobbies and interests in order run the household, take care of children, support their husband, etc. However in return the children and husband maltreat her and do not respect her and value her sacrifices. For them she is just like a maid who makes their life easy going.The movie goes off beat, when the mother starts to get modelling assignments and becomes very successful in that. Her grandson, Mann (played by Sharman Joshi) helps her in this. Even after so much success she still misses the love and affection which she would get from her family. Mann, tells her to teach a lesson to everyone in her family so that they start to respect her and value her efforts. The movie has a happy end, were Bharti reunites with her family and her family member realise her importance in their life.Its really an awesome movie, has a really a good message for the audience. The movie could be a bit shorter, but yet it doesn't stop to entertain you even for a moment.Must Watch for Indian Audience." 
" A must movie for every family.","I am very fond of Indian movie and surprising I got a chance to view this movie. I started the movie and after I just seen the starting 5 minutes of the film I was unable to stop it. The story of this movie is fantastic and it is must watch for every family man. The acting was also superb. Song are nice, means there is no boring scene. In my opinion everyone do his job perfectly. Well, the marketing of this movie is poor due to that its name is not very prominent and its business is low. But this is another factor which did not reduce the rating of this movie.It is my first review on IMDb because I want that every person should watch this movie once. And believe you it will be a part of your best movies.Thanks" 
" Makes you remember those life-teaching family dramas of 80s featuring Kader Khan, Govinda and more.","In the mid-90s, when the cable channels took over the responsibility of making family dramas for their daily viewers with all tried and tested formulas, Hindi film-makers stopped making them and "Family Genre" vanished all of a sudden from our Hindi cinema. Still occasionally films like BAGHBAAN, English VINGLISH and more successfully tried to keep the genre alive and a similar kind of attempt is also made by director Indra Kumar in his latest venture SUPER NANI, which can also be termed as a comeback film of the ageless diva Rekha.Reportedly based on the hit Gujarati play 'Baa Ae Maari Boundary', the basic plot revolves around the lady of the house going through a shocking makeover regaining her forgotten self-respect and passions of life. It readily reminds you of Sridevi in English VINGLISH and also brings back the memories of Rekha's own hit KHOON BHARI MAANG wherein too she comes back as a supermodel (though there is a huge difference in the basic theme and age factor depicted in both the movies).SUPER NANI begins on an emotional note talking about the importance of mother in every family and then goes on to introduce all seen before kind of characters reminding you of the 80s family dramas, especially the ones featuring Kader Khan and Govinda. Director Indra Kumar keeps the movie crisp with all fast moving sequences along with his typical insertions of humour like the Gay Yamraj. Plus the timely introduction of Anupam Kher in another weird comical get-up saves it from becoming a drag putting it honestly. In addition, Rekha sportingly doing all those 'Filmy' sequences referring to Madhubala, Nargis and even Amitabh Bachchan, spreads smiles among the audience, particularly impressing the middle aged ones sitting in the theater.The film holds your attention well before the intermission, but in the second half gets back to everything predictable, seen before and over melodramatic quite sadly. In short, this easily could have been another English VINGLISH banking on the comeback of a veteran artist. But its routine screenplay, uninspiring songs and a climax similar to BAGHBAN doesn't let you praise the film as anything fresh or well attempted by the experienced team. Yet, a must mention point remains that after a long time here is a family drama with a Bhajan in its soundtrack breaking the set trend. However I terribly miss the traditional rhythm and the sound of Indian instruments in such songs very frankly. Coming to the performers, needless to say that SUPER NANI entirely belongs to Rekha alone, still the noteworthy acts include the one coming from Sharman Joshi and Anupam Kher playing the Nani's school time friend. Though the faulty Hindi accent of Sharman remains unconvincing throughout and should have been avoided. Nevertheless the talented actor manages to put up a good show along with Anupam Kher in the film's second half. Randhir Kapoor, as the husband is OK contributing nothing new and the same can be said about Rajesh Kumar, Anchal Dwivedi and Shreya Narayan too (who impresses in her few scenes later). Shweta Kumar, on the other hand gets nothing much to do as the film's heroine unfortunately, whereas Vishakha Subedarplays her typical role of a bai in a perfect style.Summing up, SUPER NANI is all about the star of the film Rekha, right from the first scene to the last and she has once again delivered a polished act in her various avatars, looking stunning even at 60. So if you are a true fan then should certainly not miss the opportunity to watch her on the big screen after so many years in a full-fledged role. But if you are not, then can easily wait and watch after its DVD release or on a channel airing soon in the next few weeks." 
" this is very fantastic","There is going several internet problems within the producers actors and directors regards the promotion of the film.As they said Rekha Is only responsible for the failure of this film As I have watched the Universal certified film I found it most outstanding performance by the team, its song are also romantic. This was only a blame on Rekha but i think the whole team is responsible for the box office fail.They cannot make up to what they have to, As much as i know it was least promoted even in the music channels ....so I advice you to watch it, see even in Wikipedia there is no plot of this film There is going several internet problems within the producers actors and directors regards the promotion of the film.As they said Rekha Is only responsible for the failure of this film As I have watched the Universal certified film I found it most outstanding performance by the team, its song are also romantic.
