" Forget the Box Office, watch this film!","Okay so when the music of this movie came out, I was hopping around in hopes that Mani Ratnam will finally be successful in the Hindi film industry. But of course the film released and tanked at the box office. I was quite depressed afterward and unsure of whether to watch the film, but recently, upon a friend's recommendation, I rented it. After watching it, all I have to say is that box office says absolutely nothing about the merit of a movie (I'm sure a lot of people knew that already). Bottom line: YUVA is awesome.Sure it isn't perfect, and not near most of Ratnam's tamil movies, but it is definitely worth watching. The story is about 3 young men who come from vastly different backgrounds and schools of thought. One incident on a bridge brings them together, changing their fates forever.Abhishek Bachchan is definitely come into his own with this role. His "Lallan" is both menacing and pitiable (like the song Kabhi Neem Neem, Kabhi Shahed Shahed aptly describes). Its quite unreal how he gets into the skin of his character. He not only picked up the mannerisms but managed to capture the volatility, anger and ambition that defines Lallan. Rani Mukherji has really become my favorite actress these days. Her performance as Shashi (Lallan's wife) really compliments Bachchan's and together they make their story the most interesting and compelling aspect of the movie.Ajay Devgan and Vivek Oberoi are decent and do their jobs. Its not really their fault that Bachchan got the strongest part. Esha Deol and Kareena Kapoor don't have roles big enough to impact the movie in any way. Ajay's story as a student leader is good but might have been better. Its not super powerful but at the same time, that aspect makes the story a lot more real. Ajay's "Michael Mukherjee" doesn't overdue the preaching and the patriotism, he simply believes that his country can do better and he wants to lend a hand. Vivek Oberoi's Arjun is a simple soul until he crosses paths with Michael. Arjun's transformation from a carefree youth to someone finding a cause is not particularly powerful and could have been expanded a little. But again, this only makes it a little more real. Nobody makes that transformation overnight. Sure he found a purpose, but he's not immediately going to become the second coming of Michael Mukherjee. The scene where he quietly volunteers to stand elections with Michael is very subtle but made me think of how other directors might have dealt with that situation. You would get Arjun shouting patriotic verse at the top of his lungs with tears in his eyes. Just a tad unrealistic.I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone not only because its worth your time but also so we somehow send a message to Ratnam not to get discouraged. Please continue to tell your stories (in Hindi). We are listening." 
" One of the most striking movie ever made on Indian youth!","Wow! what was that!! this will come out from you once u watched this movie.Mani Ratnam has made a movie which will be a favorite for me 4evr!His control on the direction is simply superb and he has explored the true n real characters out of his star-cast.But my best character is Lallan played by Abhishek(hottest star in bollywood!).Perfect to bring out the brutal and wild shades in a negative role and its only after this role, he has got recognized by evry1.Kareena as the love interest of Arjun is looking too hot and her secret lies in her hair-style! (ok, i'm getting biased but i truly like her skin!)Another best part about this movie was its music.AR Rehman has done wonders in giving trance cum more hip music specially for the young listeners.The movie didn't do well in the box office as they just didn't publicized it well.Sad but true.Another sad part was the role played by Vivek as Arjun. From start till the end, he has got beaten up all the time!Any how,Yuva is one of the best Indian movies that I can proudly recommend it to any1. The linking of 3 diff parallel running stories at the end is the best part of this movie.Ratnam is agn doing a movie with Abhishek named 'Guru' and people who have seen the promos, r going gaga abt it!" 
" O Youth... awaken, the country beckons!","To be honest, I was a bit let down when I read the reviews on the net from all the possible sites on net. I am great admirer of Mani Rathnam and his style, which is unique by itself - a great master in story-telling. With great reluctance I mustered up my courage to watch the movie - at least for Mani Rathnam's sake (and A R Rahman's songs). All the negative reviews in a way did a good thing - it lowered my expectations. And I did like the movie.For reason unknown, looks like all the movie critics have joined hands and decided to have a go at Yuva. A lot has been criticised about the movie and to such an extent that Mani had to call for a press conference to ward off the negative publicity the movie was attracting owing to the film critics. From the promos and the songs, the audience were not expecting a movie on politics. Guess that added fuel to the fire. The story is good - conveys a social message to the youth and its place in the society. Story telling format is quite intelligent - I mean in three independent chapters you will see bits and pieces of other chapters and you say "oh.... it makes sense and explains that bit from earlier chapter".Abhishek-Rani track steal the show. Great performance from the two.Vivek-Kareena track is sweet. Okay its not Karan Johar, Sooraj Barjatya or Ghai or Rai types but sensible. We need more of these. Vivek-Anant Nag relationship is portrayed well. Ajay-Eesha track is okay. Eesha should join acting classes.Om Puri - first class. Vijay Raaz - should have been given more scope. Its the fault of Indian audience as well who haven't matured yet and seek the same thrash every time. It strongly denotes that every Bollywood film should adhere to the formula or else face the wrath. I mean - seriously how many people have watched 3-Deewarien and Maqbool. I am tired of the positive and 5-star reviews given to movies of Johar's, Barjatya's, Chopra's, Ghai's and Dhawan's for their same old formula stuff. Believe me folks, as other reviews state here, I reiterate - forget the critics reviews, watch the movie with a open mind and you will not be disappointed." 
" Best Hindi movie as of 2004","What else would you call a movie that has a little bit for everyone -- Yuva is an entertainer first -- of course it has a lot of firsts as well..the structure, for example, is something that is unique...all the 3 story lines start on Howrah bridge and how the director comes back to the Howrah bridge accident to take of to one of the 3 stories is poetic.. Songs add lustre to this painting and is very inherent to the flow. Anurag's dialogues are a huge plus -- I loved Om Puri's Bengali dialogues --"paranthu lekin" As far as the cast goes -- Ajay did really well as did Abhishek -- Among the ladies, I loved Esha. The Tamil version was not as engrossing as the Hindi version was, and I think that was primarily because of the cast. Mani is Mani...awesome movie." 
" Simply Youthful","Yuva is a great comeback for Maniratnam as a Hindi film director after the unsuccessful Dil Se. His earlier regional language films like Velu Nayakan, Anjali, Roja, Bombay, Iruvar and many more have been highly successful all over India. Yuva is a thrilling story of three young guns of Calcutta whose stories get connected by a road mishap. The film is based upon college. Ajay Devgan (two time National Award winner) has given a fantastic performance as a college leader along with Vivek Oberoi. The actors are aptly casted and the film is technically very good. Cinematography is just out of this world. But the limelight is stolen by Abhishek Bachchan who has given the performance of a lifetime. His role of a street-side malefactor will surely win him awards. HATS OFF TO YUVA & MANIRATNAM!!!" 
" Brilliant","The main reasons to watch this film are Mani Ratnam, A.R.Rahman, and Abishek Bachan.There is not much of a story but the screenplay is awesome. The way Mani shows the three men from different walks of life meet on a bridge three times and their flashbacks is refreshingly new.I think it should have been publicized well before they released this film. It deserved a hit.I have also seen the Telugu version, in which Madhavan's performance is outstanding.All in all, a new cinematic experience." 
" Another Masterpiece from Ratnam","An excellent movie. Though Ratnam makes this story a little unbelievable in the end. You do not really mind that because you get involved deep with it. Best part of the movie is its background score, specially for Abhishek's character. Things not to be missed:- Abhishek Bachhan's acting(cant miss that one) Ajay Devgan's action sequences Howrah Bridge action sequence Vivek's light comedy The bike on Howrah which actually crashed breaking Vivek's leg Hospital scene and others in which Vivek is limping(because of the real life accident) Om Puri's near perfect bengali accentOverall, a very good Hindi movie after a long time." 
" My Review of YUVA","Now,when i watched the trailers of this movie when they came out in April last year,i was excited.that's coz i'm a fan of Mani Ratnam and liked his previous works like Nayakan(dubbed in Hindi),Roja,Bombay&Dil Se.That's because his movies are the thinking man's delight.when it released,the reviews didn't sound too hopeful.So i thought i'll give it a miss in the theater.BIG MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!!!When I got the DVD 2 months later and watched it,i was left kicking myself about why i didn't watch it in da theater.Okay so here's the story in a nutshell.The lives of 3 men,Lallan Singh(Abhishek Bachchan),Michael Mukherjee(Ajay Devgan)&Arjun Balakrishnan(Vivek Oberoi)are intertwined on Howrah Bridge under forced circumstances.Here Lallan Singh is the kind of guy u don't want to be,Michael is the kind of guy everybody admires(ideologist)&Arjun is the typical guy next door.Each man has his own life.Lallan lives with his wife Sasi(Rani Mukherjee)who is madly in love with him even though he beats her up often.He works for his brother Gopal(Sonu Sood)who in turn is working for a slimy,smooth-talking&ever smiling politician Prosenjit Bhattacharya(Om Puri).Michael lives with his mother who is worried about him as he is growing up like his father who also was an ideologist and died for his cause&his 2 sisters who are proud of him as of his father.He has a girlfriend Radhika(Esha Deol)who teaches French and is the niece of Michael's family doctor(Saurabh Shukla).He is a student leader and wants to clean up Indian politics of dirty and slimy politicians namely Prosenjit.Arjun is a Mechanical engineering student who dreams of making it big by living the American Dream.His father(Anant Nag)however wants him to join the Indian Administrative Service.He falls in love with Mira(Kareena Kapoor)whom he meets at a disco which evolves into a series of meetings over coffee and in a tram.Mira however is getting married to a guy her parents have chosen for her.The story begins when Michael gets shot by Lallan acting on Prosenjit's orders and Arjun ends up saving his life.The climax is Utopian with Michael and Arjun winning the elections and making it to their state assembly and Lallan getting arrested and being taken to court.It has some amazing music by A.R.Rahman who seems to excel with each movie with foot-tapping songs like Fanaa,Dol Dol etc.The movie has some of the best acting performances,but Abhishek Bachchan is the pick of the lot.I have never seen such an intense performance.If u find a copy of this in u'r video library,give it a try.I guarantee you won't be disappointed." 
" Independent-esq","The first review I ever read for this film was on IndiaFM and that was after I watched it. That review completely underrated this film. Just from looking across the web I've come across a couple rotten reviews too, all of which I don't agree with.SPOILER WARNING:A lot of people complain about a "real" ending for Little B's character Lallan - not just the scene in jail before he goes for sentencing. But did anyone ever care to use their imagination for a change? The problem with a lot of Indian cinema is that most times they are very predictable and feed you detail for detail everytime. It's disgusting sometimes, because it's overdone in so many ways. I find it very refreshing to see a film come along that doesn't do that.I've also read a lot of complaints about how the Kareena/Vivek story doesn't strike as a deep, heart-wrenching one. Does it have to do that to be good? Less is more no? Why should it have to be overdone in the Muhjse Dosti Karoge-Main Prem Ke Diwani Hoon format? Can't simple, sweet love be acceptable? Did anyone see the ending for Bichhoo? or the infamous Lagaan for that matter?Then there is the Ajay/Esha story that I read was no big "woop". 'The fact that they win elections doesn't make a difference, you aren't leaving your seats jumping up in the air'. I beg to differ...While Politics plays a large role in this film, intelligent movie go-ers who can read between the lines and appreciate the film for what it is, looking beyond the politics of it all, will disagree. This movie reminds me very much so of an IFC production of some kind - rich in raw emotion, with clean and simple real acting.Speaking of the IFC I read that this film 'wouldn't appeal to the masses' because of the politics and thus, it wouldn't be a 'worthy' film... hmmm where have I heard that before??? Oh yeah! Michael Moore "Bowling for Columbine" - yeah! and he won an Oscar! So much for not appealing to the masses - that DOES NOT mean it's a bad film. And it is NOT grounds to call it a flop either. Come on people use your brain, that's what it's there for!Abhshiek is amazing in his negative role as Lallan and I would not be surprised if he won Filmfare's Best Villain. In this role he really did squash doubts that he isn't a Baachan(sp?).Rani is as beautiful, and talented as always. She really did this role justice as Lallan's wife.Esha was sweet and simple, she didn't need to do extreme acting - less is more.Ajay - well he doesn't disgust me anymore. Another surprise - he did his role well. Who knew he could play a college student and do it well. Too bad, he won't let Kajol do another film with Shah Rukh (but that's another review).Kareena, good role, she played it well.Vivek surprised me - he did his role justice. The music is amazing! From the techno, to the ethnic to the chorale sounds, it was awesome. First class on that!Final verdict - forget the critics - they know nothing anyway - WATCH THE FILM!!! Make your own decision." 
" Yuva! Yuva! Yuva!","This was a very well made and very well cast film! It's so ironic because the thing that will draw you to watch this film is its lack of appeal. You see it and it looks so dreary, so damp like a murky rainy day and yet there's just that light at the end of the tunnel that sucks you into it.Yuva is the very beautifully shot story of three men, whose lives are impacted by one another one faithful afternoon when their paths cross aboard a bridge. It all begins with Michael Mukherjee (Ajay Devgan) seemingly being assassinated at the start of the film by Abhishek Bachchan's character, Arjun (Vivek Oberoi) a casual bystander is caught in the cross-fire and in a series of flashbacks, their stories are told one after another in sequence that updates the viewer with what led to the violent scenario.In flashback, we learn that Bacchan's character is a wife-beating thug who has just been released from prison and is about to get his hands dirty again by meddling in dirty politics with Om Puri's sinister politician character. Rani Mukherjee, Bollywood's "go-to poster girl for the role that might lead to Oscar" plays Bacchan's battered wife who wishes he would quit his wild ways.We find out that Michael Mukherjee is a student body union leader who is trying to challenge society at all costs and will go to any length to uphold justice. A cross with Sonu Sood's Gopal (also Bachchan's character's brother) is what leads to the ill-fated occurrence aboard the bridge. A radiant looking, French teaching Esha Deol plays the love interest of Michael's and never mind the age difference, their chemistry is hot and they sizzle! We also find out via flashback that playboy Arjun (Oberoi) has just return home to Kolkata from college and plans on going abroad when he meets at falls in love with a supposedly non-makeup wearing Kareena Kapoor at a nightclub. It is in his quest to get the girl that he gets caught in the cross fire aboard the bridge.Everybody holds their own in this gritty drama of politics and patriotism. Yuva is a Hindi cinema accomplishment and not to be missed by anyone.The songs are exceptional, the music is hauntingly beautiful and relevant. Yuva has worked its way into my top ten list of great Hindi cinema films. I subtracted one point though for the violence. ;-)" 
" A good depiction of youth's mind","I agree to kaushik dave up to some extent that it bears a resemblance with Amores Perros but at one point only and it is that there are three different stories meeting at one point but that is the end.What impresses me more about this movie is the true depiction of youth's mind (sp. in Pakistan, India and other third world countries). Today's youth is matured but confused, helping but selfish for themselves and above all sentimental yet insensitive. Like Arjun, on the face he is loving, caring and always wants to be with family but inside wants to go to US for good career. Same is true for Lallan, very selfish thinks only for himself and nothing else. But the true high point of the movie is Michael Thinking and approach towards things. He is the one driving force for others.As per direction, Mani Ratman's movie is always special for its visual feat and that is also true for this movie. And above all AR Rehman Music is true to the story." 
" Great Entertainer.","The problem with the Hindi Film Industry has been low life Johnny-come-lately directors and actors who has taken over the Industry with the help of the Media pied piper morons and they have been put on the pedestal and worshiped as if we need these morons. Here comes Mani Ratnam (Ram Gopal Varma, Vikaram Bhatt,etc) who know talent when they see one (Esha Deol and exception) and cast them irrespective of the the Box office predictions. This is one tightly packaged and past paced movie with some great dialog, acting and direction. Abishek performance should make his papa proud. This kid has come a long way and he is even beginning to look like his old man. Next comes Rani, Vivek. Of course the Veteran Om Puri, is a delight to watch no matter what he does. Esha Deol cannot act-period. Ratnam or a Varma cannot extract any acting from this lasse-it is like trying to get juice out of a scotch tape. The stories run parallel and concurrently which adds a mystery like quality to the narration and one of the staple of a good cinema-the dialog is superb. The action scenes are very authentic and not the cheap variety seen in the decadent and discrepit Sharukh Khan and Salman Khan films. Mani Ratnam and Ram Gopal Varma have elevated the Hindi Cinema to the level that an Indian should be proud of, in fact this film sounds like a fast version of a Satyajit Ray film and that is a compliment for a filmmaker." 
" Outstanding !!!","The film is so fresh even after 12 years of its release , still relevant to the point.Maniratnam has his magic touch in this one too, locations are great. Calcutta is interesting as always and captured very well.Rehman's music suits the mood of the film so does the score, Screenplay is tight although i don't like the Lallan's part.Acting wise Ajay Devgan is best followed by Vivek Oberoi , Rani Mukharjee ,Kareena Kapoor ,Anant Nag and rest are also good.Need Less to say one of the best films ever made in Bollywood !! Go for this quality cinema." 
" cinematic excellence wondrously depicted on screen by the maestro","what a movie, i m impressed!! i had watched the movie long time back but somehow watching it now poked me to write something about it.. Take a bow mani sir & his able team.. Not frequently one gets to witness such tight screenplay & stellar acts by the main & the supporting cast.. And it really is difficult to point out the best of them.. such is the direction accorded.. Tight screenplay, edge of the seat narration , acting, action sequences & still fresh music by rehman sir, keep the spectator stuck to his/her seat. told in flashbacks, another deviation from the leak, this flick winds together stories of three different couples to a common point & takes forward.All three tales are good, excellently detailed & acted upon.. Such is the brilliance exhibited that one can not really single out a particular one, but still abhishek's was the best.. Though ajay as usual was at his cunning best.. Abhishek's was best as he has not performed that well till now.. special mention of the lady love portrayed by rani, she oozes liveliness in her role & gives it her bindaas touch.. Ajay gets to vocalize some good lines but he walks away effortlessly, a tailor made act for him.. Vivek as a flirt,suits the role well & his romantic angle 7 metamorphosis into a serious guy, is laudable too... Not to forget the supporting cast, especially the versatile om puri, enthralling with his shrewd, bad politics & some nicely done Bengali diction.. But what keeps the the three stories together is the sheer excellent music & background score by the maestro himself, one which is still hummable & feels new & fresh, guess even after 15 years..Such is the novelty factor associated with the tunes, ones still popular in discotheques.. In all, a great piece of work. thank you mani sir." 
" Masterpiece","The film truly represents the Indian youth and urges them to think over the current situation. Excellent music by A R Rahman, as always. Spectacular performances by all the cast specially by Abhishek Bachchan.Three strong ideologies and personalities cross their path and change each others' lives forever. The youth will be able to relate to the characters.Much of the engineering junta aiming to settle in the US will really love Vivek Oberoi's character. Abhishek Bachchan delivers a strong character and performs it really well indeed with the UP accent. Ajay Devgan, as always, just spectacular.I am shocked to see that this kind of work was not appreciated in Bollywood. A must watch for anybody who hasn't seen it yet." 
" Intelligent, Voluptuous","*A very minor spoiler revealed just to praise the action by the lead actor.*Magic means Mani Ratnam. Each and every work by Mani Ratnam is ravishing - be it Dil Se, Roja or Kannathil Muthamittal. Yuva is just another title in his lustrous list of films.Three stories are connected by a road accident that features four times in the film from different angles. We are given a confusing outsight of the accident the first time and then as the flashbacks of each character are etched, the accident unveils completely towards the last time. Editor A. Sreekar Prasad deserves full marks for his awesome work, especially during the accident and the finale.Story takes a backseat in this exquisite character-driven film that has an adroit screenplay by the talented Ratnam. Art direction by Sabu Cyril follows every minute detail to an extent that every character is given a distinct mood and color. Ravi K. Chandran (cinematographer) complements Cyril well.The theme by itself may not appeal to everyone. Student politics is a dry subject and the last one would think of to tackle in a two and three quarter hours film but Ratnam churns out a screenplay which keeps you hooked far more than recent suspense films. He takes his time to set up the background of the stories but that done once, he intertwines them to give a cocktail of moods, actions, each of which is justifiable, thanks to the strong character sketches. Apart from the technical excellence, the film has strong performances.Rani Mukherji is supremely efficient in her limited screen time. Her daunting eyes full of wrath and helplessness haunt you till much after the culmination. The vulnerability portrayed is preeminent. National award winning actor Ajay Devgn is slightly old for his role but does his job as the overshadowed protagonist well. Esha Deol looks pretty and camouflages her bad dialogue delivery. Kareena Kapoor is very much her fairy-like girl-next-door character. She oozes energy in each of her scene and is a breath of fresh air. She, however, appears less after her flashback. Vivek Oberoi is completely opposite to Company and transitions well from his cool-dude attitude to the more serious, ambitious student leader. Om Puri dominates every frame he is in with his typical Bangla accent, eccentric, eerie looks and the cunning character within. Saving the best for last - Abhishek Bacchan. Lallan Singh is the most exciting character he has ever played and the ease with which he fits it is commendable. The lovely, charming husband to Mukherjee or the rugged goon of the gali, Bacchan excels in his complex, multi-dimensional personality which goes after not-so-good jobs for a good living. His outrage at Mukherji when she aborts his child is beyond the describable limits (now that's Ratnam)!The gunshots, fights, dialogues are very rustic, raw and real (barring the final fight which is a masterpiece by different standards). Ratnam adds the right amount of light scenes amidst the high octane screenplay. The third flashback is not strongly related to the other two stories but as mentioned earlier, it is a breath of fresh air and a treat to watch the spontaneous Kareena. Music by Rahman is good but the lyrics are stolid. "Dhakka Laga Bukka, Khayega Re Mukka" makes no sense and is the weakest of all the songs. How one wishes that the classy background was included in the album. Ratnam, nevertheless, integrates the songs well into the film.Vijay Raaz, Saurabh Shukla, Anant Nag and the bunch of supporting actors enact their parts well. On the whole, Yuva is an intelligent film, not to be judged by its box office performance. The Tamil counterpart, Aaytha Ezhuthu, is equally mesmerizing and it is extremely difficult to choose the better of the two. Yuva's excellence is much ahead of times. Not even in 2012, eight years later, do you come across such films quite oft."
