" A "ghatiya" 3rd standard movie!!","Yesterday I watched this movie, I think it is one of the worst movie ever made in Bollywood.I am just repenting that why I wasted my time for such a movie.The movie has poor plot, poor direction & poor acting. The film is full of clich√©s and topics that have been addressed in movies a billion times before. As the film ends, you wonder if the filmmaker justifies adultery, prostitution and exploitation of women in general, including the casting couch. You also wonder if there is an underlying message in the film, which hints that a woman needs to sleep around to get ahead in life! The lewdness in dialogues and scenes puts you off."
