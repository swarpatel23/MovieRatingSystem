" Mediocre CGI animation by Bollywood","This is a mediocre attempt at an Indian CGI animated film. It's the same old hackneyed storyline of a typical Bollywood romance with the characters all dogs. There is little evidence of any further imagination on display. The constant references to Yashraj films annoy. The voice work is unremarkable and both Kareena and Saif seem to be essentially reprising their well known off-screen personae. Only Javed Jaffrey leaves an impression as the villain Charlie Anna. One plus point- the animation quality. While not even close to international standards, it's leagues ahead of anything previously made in India.Overall 4/10" 
" I know what the others think, but...","Am I the only non-Indian teenage boy who actually enjoyed this film? If not, that's fine with me. That's right, I watched Roadside Romeo (a wordplay on an Indian term for 'flirt') on DVD with English subtitles and liked it. It's probably the 2nd in a full line-up of movies about dogs from October 2008 to February 2009 (Chihuahua, Romeo, Bolt, Marley, Hotel and Vomit). Sure it may be campy at some parts, but hey, this is India's first well-animated film, so I'll cut them some slack. This film is kinda like a CGI Bollywood version of Lady and the Tramp meets All Dogs Go To Heaven, but there's nothing wrong with that. You'll need to watch some Bollywood films in order to understand the film itself. Myself, I haven't even watched any ordinary Bollywood film, but I've watched some clips and heard of Yash Raj's other hits, so I understand.Ever since the giant Hindi studio Yash Raj Films included a clip from 'Cars' in 'Dhoom 2' and used the Disney Store and a song provided by Disney (non-pop) in Ta Ra Rum Pum, Disney had decided to join forces with the studio to create Roadside Romeo. Before the film was developed, Indian animation looked pretty cheesy. But Tata Elxsi, a VFX studio responsible for doing VFX for plenty of Bollywood films and two of Marvel's films, did a pretty impressive job on making it almost Pixar quality. (I've heard in the commentary that someone from Pixar came over to visit the creators and teach them how to do fur)Anyway, the film is about a spoiled, cute-looking, rich dog dude named Romeo (Saif Ali Khan) who gets abandoned on the streets of Mumbai, where he gets bullied and then befriended by a pack of strays with unique personalities. Guru is the leader of the pack. His name speaks everything about him. Hero English is a dog with a funny hairstyle, buckteeth and a bow-tie who wishes to actually speak full English, though a lot of the characters speak broken English and Hindi at the same time. His eyes and his buckteeth might make you think of Sid the Sloth from Ice Age. Interval is a big fan of YRF who copies many lines of the actors who have starred in their films. Mini is, believe it or not, a pretty aggressive alley cat, just about the only one in the movie, who thinks she is a stray dog and refuses to disbelieve it. Oh, and there's also a mouse who is kind of the Jerry type when it comes to enemies.Together, Romeo and the strays start a salon after Romeo shows his haircutting skills just so they can get some business. One night, Romeo falls in love with a pretty female pooch named Laila (Kareena Kapoor) after hearing her sing and watching her dance. The next day, Romeo meets a ferocious, disgusting, big-lipped bulldog with a bit of an accent named Charlie Anna (Jaaved Jaffery), his sidekick Chhainu, who gets beaten up all the time and looks like Wile E. Coyote's long lost father, and his female ninja dogs, Charlie's Angels. Which set of girls do the Angels parody? Well, duh! Romeo and Charlie rival over Laila, much to the dismay of Romeo's friends. Who will win? Everyone knows the answer...I've listened to one of the songs from the film everyday surprisingly. They're just so catchy! My most favourite song has to be "Choo Le Na". The songs are better than the cheap pop songs Disney has to spew out today! ;) A few song sequences in this movie act like Indian music videos. You might see a character appearing in some random place while singing and dancing. The biggest example is in "Cool Cool".The creators acted quite like Pixar when doing this movie. Not only did they do impressive animation/motion capture inspired by that of Ratatouille, they also released teaser trailers without actual footage one year before the film was released. In the film itself, they managed to slip in some in-jokes of the Pixar tradition, including the name "Tata", some posters of other Yash Raj films, photographs of YRF's actors/actresses and some Mickey Mouse references. Heck. they even added some bloopers in the credits! If only Pixar used them more often... Maybe on their DVDs.Though it ain't the best animated film of 2008, Roadside Romeo has plenty of charm and feel, including some tension, beautiful romantic moments (especially , and clever humour. It does have gross-out humour including flatulence, but there's one bit of it that actually made me laugh. At Charlie is the most appropriate victim! My big problem with the film was - did Yash Raj care about the audience of theirs that loves Disney and is not familiar with Bollywood? Still, there are some parts that kids would enjoy (Hindu kids, even), such as the little mouse's moments and the Looney Tunes style gags. But not all of it is kiddy. Poor Romeo gets strangled several times, for instance. Kids might not even be interested, to tell you the truth. :rolleyes: And yes, Indian cinema still has intermissions. I highly recommend this film if you're a freak for animation, Bollywood, dogs or anthropomorphic animals." 
" Just stepped out of this movie - Not Worth","Just stepped out of this movie,my 50 cents:Strong Points:Charlie Anna by Javed Jaffrey. Released on the Festival Diwali.Weak Points: Weak/No - Story Line,Dialogs,Character Study Dialogs copied from Yashraj Movies Should have had a better voice than Saif for the Character Romeo (He Lacks the Variation in his Voice),so at least the main characters could hold the audience in the theater!Conclusion: Walt Disney, please live up to the expectations that have been set by Legends like WALL.E" 
" The Bark was better than the bite, the movie worser than the hype!","In a world where Pixar sets the gold standard in animated films, Yash Raj Film's Roadside Romeo (incidentally Dinsey's foray into Bollywood as well) will find it hard to even pass the QC test. Both the animation and the story leave a lot to be desired and the only positive outlook for the movie is that being the only major release this Diwali and potentially a hit with the kids, it should barely manage to trudge along. The story of a dog, Romeo (voiced by Saif Ali Khan) who was living the lavish life and suddenly finds himself on the mean streets of the city is clichéd to a fault. Romeo falls for Laila (Kareena Kapoor) who also happens to be the crush of bad dog Charlie Anna (Javed Jaffrey) and predictable mayhem follows. Jugal Hansraj's direction relies too much on borrowing from Bollywood lore (Yash Raj film scenes and dialogs are copied galore) and too little on character study. It is an earnest effort perhaps but if anyone thought animation didn't need a story, they should ask the studio that made the animation movie event of the year, WallE. The film hardly has any genuinely funny moments, and the background sets, though well detailed, lack punch. The redeemer is eventually Javed Jaffrey, who is the only one who seems to know how to voice an animation character. He brings out the quirks of Charlie Anna superbly to life and provides the few laughs there are in the film. The tepid songs and a basic background score do nothing to add to the appeal. Ultimately, the gag reel during the end credits turns out to be funnier than the movie itself. And that's saying a lot." 
" A Great Romantic Animation.....","In every sense one is glad Indian animation has come such a long way. It would be wrong to say that so far we have been doing an inferior job in comparison to our Hollywood counterparts. However the quality hasn't been at par. With Roadside Romeo, Indian animation films have taken a giant leap forward and kudos to Yash Raj Films and Walt Disney Studios for being the one to raise the bar up by many notches.Bottom line is the fact that Roadside Romeo is ultimately a movie that has stemmed from the land of masala films, so expecting anything different is sheer blasphemy. The film has lovers, a villain and great humor - the ultimate essentials for a Bollywood caper. But then being animated and convincing is what whisks this film away from clutches of the inane Bollywood film monster.Romeo (Saif Ali Khan) the quintessential lover dog is thrown onto the streets, where he meets newly found best mutts. Soon enough he bumps into the love of his life, Laila (Kareena) who happens to be a nightclub performer. Besides falling in love, the biggest mistake Romeo commits is having rubbed Charlie Anna (Javed Jaffrey) the wrong way. With a villain to combat and love to win over, the film is all Romeo and tons of heart.One can't stop gushing over the fact that Yash Raj Films and Disney have brought to India what can be called India's first world class animation film. It's not perfect, but nonetheless still great. Had the movie been made into a live Acton one, perhaps it would not have worked. Even story-wise the film is extremely light. But it is exactly these aspects that make Roadside Romeo lovable. The film is entertaining, funny and light. There is little that your mind needs to work on and it's escapism at its best." 
" One word to sum up the film","Rubbish! I was really looking forward to this film, the start was quite captivating but then you're told this guy lived a life of glam but never actually see it and then from there I think it's just to raunchy and the dogs are too much in human form to really call it an animation. Whats with the constant singing man? Comeon, this really sucks! Rubbish! I was really looking forward to this film, the start was quite captivating but then you're told this guy lived a life of glam but never actually see it and then from there I think it's just to raunchy and the dogs are too much in human form to really call it an animation. Whats with the constant singing man? Comeon, this really sucks!" 
" Too bland and hackneyed for me to really enjoy it","Roadside Romeo does indeed start in a very captivating way. I liked the idea and the film does start very strongly with quite a stirring opening scene. But overall, it just didn't do it for me, just too bland and hackneyed. Granted, the animation is pretty good, not outstanding but the backgrounds and sceneries were at least striking. Also Javed Jaffrey is a lot of fun here. However, the writing is sadly awful on the whole, while the story is too hackneyed and predictable. Then there is the music, it was the same with the singing, it got too much and became distracting. Jaffrey aside, the remainder of the voice work is inconsistent, ranging from so-so to barely adequate. I'm sorry to say I didn't really feel anything for the characters, they were dull mostly or annoying. The pacing started off great, almost riveting, but when the story meandered just before the halfway mark the pace dragged until the final result was as limp as a bad hair day. In conclusion, started off promisingly but lost its momentum making it forgettable and altogether very unexceptional film. 4/10 Bethany Cox" 
" Yash Raj Films are back on track","I was beginning to think that Yash Raj Films were losing their touch after delivering a list of box office flops which is Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, Laaga Chunari Mein Daag, Aaja Nachle, Tashan & Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic but not after watching Bachna Ae Haseeno & Roadside Romeo. Roadside Romeo is the film which set to launch the animation era in Bollywood is co production between Yash Raj Films and Disney. The love story, revolving around talking dogs, has the voices of real-life couple Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor.The film was really good, funny, lively and keeps a smile on your face throughout. I intended to see it because it is the first proper animated film of Bollywood and that is a milestone. Javed Jaffery has given the best vocal performance of the comic villain Charlie Anna who is a bulldog. The animation was really great although it can't match with Pixar animation but still it's good for a Bollywood movie. It has all the Indian masala like music, songs, dancing and a love story but it wasn't long and was about 1 hour 40 minutes. The songs were really good that will get better after you watch the film. Overall this is an absolute entertaining flick for all the kids & adults." 
" Do not see this pile of rubbish","My ten year old, admittedly now weaned on Dickens and Austen, asked to walk out after ten minutes. Without doubt the worst film I've ever seen. Suddenly the 'Golden Compass' seems coherent, the animated 'Anastasia' tasteful and 'Armageddon' a serious addition to the sci-fi genre.The poster was extremely misleading. It did not make it clear this film was in Hindi with English subtitles. That it was a animated musical. It said it was a co-Disney production (which made a difference to me). Nor did it make it clear that the people involved were clearly not professional film makers, and deserved to be tied to the roof of the Sydney Opera house and gently pelted with seagull droppings.The only reason we went was to be out of the house and avoid my wife's piano quartet rehearsal. Nothing - I reasoned - could be worse than that. Damn but I was wrong." 
" Curry Canines","I ended up watching this yesterday while a few of us had 2hrs to kill before dinner. Seems, it is the only excuse you can really have to watch this movie. It really is not worth the effort to take time out, drive to the cinemas and dedicate a part of your evening for Roadside Romeo - it will be too much of a disappointment.The bad: - Animation might be a big step for audiences used to only Bollywood movies, but it's not really much for international audiences, even when compared to a decade older Pixar. - Too many songs!! What in the world was the director after, we have no idea. Possibly nothing else to fill in the gaping holes of the narrative. - The painfully overused and redone masala story that now every Indian is born with the knowledge of. - Bad (or mediocre) voice work by most of the cast incl. Saif & Kareena.The good: - Javed Jaffery. Actually, he can do a lot better than he has done here, but it still is very good. The guy is hilarious as the Madrasi-accented top-dog "Charlie Anna", accompanied by three bitches he calls Yangels - "Charlie's Yangels" - and he names them.... Silk Sunitha, Nylon Nandai & Polyester Padmini!! - Sanjay Mishra as Chhainu, Charlie Anna's sidekick. This is a gifted comedian, and possibly the strongest character in the movie. Even in his relatively smaller role, he does such a great job with his Tapori-ishtyle quips. - Kiku Sharda as Hero English. Again, a small character, but with such great humor in him. He has a tendency to repeat everything he says in a literal word-by-word English translation. For example, he announces "Charlie Anna aa gaya!! Charlie Anna come go!!" or the hilarious "Wo tumko Jaan se maar dega! He will hit you with life!"Apart from this, there is one good idea of the dog-world in the movie, that explains why dogs love to howl so much in the middle of the night (it's a game they play!)All-in-all, an easy one to forego. But equally easy to sit through if you have to wait for 93 minutes.My rating --> 2 of 5." 
" Animation good, Plot Bad","The plot of the movie is very simple, it kind of reminds me of The Lady and the Tramp parts one and two. It's not because Romeo came from a rich family, but it was the gangs and the dog catcher. The music was pretty good, just hearing it gives you the feeling that it's made for kids.There were two things that was a huge turn off for me in the movie, one was the way they moved the characters and second was the script. There was something that bothered me with how they made the dogs move, sometimes the arms would look weird and sometimes the facial expressions doesn't really match with the emotion their suppose to do. Like when Romeo's going to howl, he looks like he's just opening his mouth and looking up. There are also moments when the characters are suppose to touch each other (a pat on the head, hug, etc.), they look like they have force fields surrounding them, making it look like the characters are in an invisible ball. Some of the characters look nude, for example, Charlie Anna, he reminds me of a naked Peter Griffin. And sometimes Romeo eye's would look infected.And the script! I think this is the biggest thing that ruined the film, kids these days don't use the word "dude" anymore. In the movie Romeo uses a lot of slang's from the 80's, I think it would be better if bollywood animators would lay off the "cool factor" e.g. shades, motorcycles, high shirt collar and the Elvis hair do.The thing that impressed me the most about the movie was the details, the fur, the lighting and everything in between. The way they made the characters unite with their background, like the shadows on their fur and the shine in their eyes. The details on the fur makes me want to buy a Romeo stuffed toy, he's so FLUFFY!!! They fur is the biggest thing that impresses me about the movie. Compared to Sully from Monsters Inc. I would rate Romeo somewhere above Sully in my Fluff-o-meter. I also watched the special features of the DVD where they showed how they modeled Romeo, from the inside out. I like the details of their teeth, when they smile of talk, they don't just show a tongue, and the nose look so dog like, the way they made the wetness of it shine from the light.... http://miniganesha.blogspot.com" 
" Disney Hitting Bottom!","This film starts with a vain and spoiled male dog, the title Romeo, singing and dancing, in a very sexist performance, with bitches kissing him like he was a king. The horrible pop song lasts much longer than it should and, when it's over, we find out that it was a tale of said dog about how his life was, before he was kicked out by his owners. After such a nasty presentation of the character, it's absolutely impossible to sympathise with him. Instead of been kicked out, he should've been "put to sleep"...The rest of the plot is just dumb. Romeo is attacked by a gang of stray dogs (plus a cat and a rat), which start fighting each other for no good reason, instead of beating the hell out of Romeo. Romeo becomes an Eddie-Scissorhands-like and trims the dogs, for no reason, making them his friends (I wondered where he kept those scissors hidden). They decide to start a business of dog hair cut, when Romeo discovers they have to pay (with bones, the currency) for "protection" to a mobster. Romeo refuses to pay, fights the mob member and... nothing really happens (clearly, the kingpin is not a Corleone). Romeo meets a bitch on a roof top (yes, those dogs climb up house roofs like cats, and sing horrible pop songs), harasses her and is (obviously) ditched. More nonsense follows until an animal control team shows up and tries to arrest all the strays. For no clear reason, Romeo decides to save the kingpin from being captured, what eventually leads him to become the roof-top-singing bitch's "dogfriend". The end (more or less, keep reading).The plot makes little sense, with lots happening for weak or no reason and, worse, going to absurd and/or stupid directions. It is about an hour and a half long, with about half of that filled with horrible musical performances (awful pop songs with ridiculous choreography).And when you think the musical acts are the worst part of the film, you just find out that it's also a comedy! The visual jokes are all kitschy, forced and embarrassing, like when the kingpin screams to Romeo, the camera zooms out to show the planet Earth, and everything is distorted by the boom wave of his voice (yeah, sound waves in space... pure comedy...)Technically, the film is also a disaster. The animation is awkward, like in the "ReBoot" computer animated television series, but that was in 1994, one year before "Toy Story". To simplify the animation, I guess, there is a lot of close-ups of the characters (so, there is a lot less to animate and render). Actually, the fourth wall is put down a lot, with Romeo talking to the camera, annoyingly. Movements disregard gravity, mass, momentum (like the Velociraptors of the first "Jurassic Park", they also didn't know the meaning of mass or gravity) and friction, so it's not seldom to see characters "sliding" on the landscape. And when it reaches "The End", and you think nothing else could make it worse, the credits roll and you are presented with "deleted footage", like in the credits of a Jackie Chan film, except that they manage to be even less funny than the original scenes! They are like bad jokes that someone (that didn't "get" them) makes worse by trying to explain them, with more unfunny jokes...It's absolutely unbelievable that this is a Disney production. I mean, after rising from the dead by the end of the 20th century, Disney became one of the biggest producers of cinematographic content of the beginning of the 21st century, eventually engulfing Pixar and acquiring the "Star Wars" franchise. When I saw the 3D CGI castle and heard Disney's theme song, I thought it was some kind of joke, I really expected some character would jump up screaming "gotcha!", but no one did, it is, indeed, a Disney production! This film is as embarrassing as those anti-Nazi propaganda films Disney produced during WWII, except this one has no war to blame for its failure. I simply cannot understand how this has an IMDb score above 5, as it is as bad (or maybe even worse) as other computer animated disaster, like "Plumiferos" (2010)." 
" Roadkill Romeo","It could have been worse. Better than Food fight. It is like a Yash Raj films parody. Having said that here are its downfalls. Laila is 1 dimensional. All that crying over her by Charlie was painful to watch and unnecessary. The plot was not great. The hi-jinx in the movie is totally like cheap comedy from 1930s animation. The dialogue falls flat at many places. Some good word play and comedy in Hindi to English translations was enjoyable. Only one song was decent. So overall not good not bad but somewhere in between with lots of mistakes to learn from to make a better movie later on." 
" A Nutshell Review: Roadside Romeo","I guess the number of dogs in Disney's repertoire isn't enough, and this year they're looking to grow the kernel which houses the likes of the 101 Dalmations, Goofy, Pluto, Lady and the Tramp with Bolt, Beverly Hills Chihuahua and of course, Roadside Romeo and his pooch friends hailing from India.Touted as the first Indian full length CG-animated film, the end credits reveal just how much Disney's participation here likely amounted to, being primarily consultants to what was mostly work done by Tata Exlsi Visual Computing Lab. And it's a pretty fine job those guys there are doing, because if you were to strip away the Hindi language and end credit roll so as not to cue in on production details, you're more than likely to think that this was made by Disney themselves. So it's absolutely not a bad effort at all, for a first film.Animation aside, this is as Bollywood a movie as it can get, with distinct song and dance sequences rooted in Bollywood spirit. Storywise, it's kept really simple with one main plot running and no sub plots trying to complicate matters. The characters too seem to leap out of a typical Bollywood film with over the top villains and their slimy incompetent henchmen, err, dogs, coupled with the propensity to switch to English with constant plurality and grammatic errors in efforts to impress everyone.Saif Ali Khan voices the titular character of Romeo, once a dog living the life of luxury, before given the boot onto the streets when his owners take off to settle overseas. Left to fend for himself, he relies on his street smarts, suave ways, quick wit and smooth talking to garner himself a posse of abandoned dogs and one cat, putting into use his fashionable skills with the scissors to open a salon for the neighbourhood hounds.Adversary comes in the form of a Don Corleone Godfather type bulldog named Charlie Anna (Javed Jaffrey), who has three "angels" for protection (and to fuel plenty of tired Charlie Angels jokes and references) and to dish out torture, running a protection racket which Romeo and gang run afoul of given their new enterprise, and on a personal level, the rivalry for the affections of Laila (Kareena Kapoor), which becomes the centerpiece in the second half of the film. The first half did seem a bit of a drag though, especially with the expanded introduction of Charlie Anna and subsequent scenes just to demonstrate what he's capable of, together with some repetitive threats of torture that definitely tested patience.Otherwise, once the seeds of romantic rivalry has been sown, with Laila being marked as Charlie Anna's romantic target, it led to a number of hilarious playful cross-exchanges between Charlie, Romeo and his gang Guru (Vrajesh Hirjee), Interval (Suresh Menon), Hero English (Kiku Sharda), and cat Mini (Tanaz Irani), which the victim given its focus on these characters was Laila, being reduced to an unfortunate supporting presence.For some strange reason, Roadside Romeo needed some getting used to as the dogs prance around on two hind legs most of the time, which brought back some memories of The Barnyard. But once you come to terms with it (just like how the Barnyard's bulls all have udders), it's quite an enjoyable and light piece of animation that should do well with its intended demographic, though to an international audience, some nuances because of one pooch's frequent impersonation of Bollywood legends might be woefully lost in translation." 
" extremely cute and funny. a treat for the whole family","i saw this movie on 23rd(october) in Dubai . i went for a 6:30 show having very high expectations. i wasn't at all disappointed. first of all o think Saif Ali Khan did a very good job his voice was fantastic.Karena was good. Layla looked very beautiful. Charlie Anna was voiced very well. he was my favorite and extremely funny.the songs were good. acting good.romeo doesn't look so good but who cares.?? i kept on laughing through the whole movie. overall the movie was fantastic.i recommend this movie for all ages.a very good family movie which amazes all.overall 10/10" 
" Wow, this is bad","The animation is clunky and stiff, the character designs simply ugly and off putting and the story? Obvious, boring and without charm. Despite the other reviews, I find it hard yo believe Disney had ANYthing to do with this."
