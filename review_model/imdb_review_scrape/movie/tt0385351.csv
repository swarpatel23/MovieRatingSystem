" No wonder this movie took forever to release","Okay, where do I start?  I'll start with the dubbing.  Everyone's dialogue delivery was incredibly pathetic.  I don't know if it was even the actors' own voices.  It was so comical, especially Shahrukh and Mohnish Behl's. It's funny to see everybody like ten years younger. This movie is so slow and unbearable.  I couldn't sit through the whole thing.  Nothing happens in like over half-an-hour, and then all of a sudden, some major event takes place so abruptly, that you don't have time to register what happened.  The movie makes no sense whatsoever.  All the important things happen so hastily, and you're left to get bored the rest of the movie.  The script is terrible.  The songs were the only good part of the film.  The only reason I watched this movie in the first place is because I thought, How can I not watch a new SRK flick?  Save yourself the trouble and skip this one." 
" I just wasted 150 minutes of my life!","This is the worst Bollywood movie that I have ever seen. Before I knew that this was one of SRK's first films and was not made in 2004, I thought both SRK and his agent needed a head check for taking this film. I am so glad that he has disowned this movie. My poor husband actually bought this movie because SRK was in it. We will shelf it next to our copy of "Plan 9 from Outer Space." Believe it or not, this movie makes "Plan 9" (touted as the worst Hollywood movie ever made) look like Oscar material. All the great elements of a classic Bollywood movie--great dancing, lavish cinematography, captivating storyline--are missing from this movie. When the movie has to use two kids to sing an adult love song, something is wrong. I kept rewinding the movie and checking the DVD box to see if I had accidentally gotten a pirated or abridged copy of the actual movie because there were huge plot holes and many scenes appeared to be missing. I'm going to have to watch a great SRK movie like "Kal Ho Na Ho" just to get the bad taste of this movie out of my mouth." 
" Shahrukh disowned himself from this film!","Yes, this film took so long to make that SRK didn't want anything to do with it and disowned himself from it. This is why his voice in the film isn't his own but rather the dubbed voice of another actor.The producer/director/entire unit should have left it on the shelf where it belonged or started over with another cast. It only became a source of shame and humiliation to all involved. It's no wonder Shahrukh wants no part of this pathetic film.Like the previous commenter, I couldn't sit through any more than 10 minutes of it. Actually, I was surprised that I sat that long without attacking my DVD player. Sorry, but if there was a negative vote that I could give it - it would get -10 out of 10!" 
" Outdated","This movie was shooted begin of the '90-ies, Shah Rukh Khan was just a starting actor. So this movie has been lying on the shelf for more than 10 years! Of course the numbers, the looks, the clothes, the make up, the set, EVERYTHING looks different and out dated. The usual brilliant voice of Shah Rukh has been replaced by a squeaky high voice, which does not suit him at all. The story has a normal beginning, but the ending left me so puzzled, there was no real ending. I guess the producers thought we have material on a living legend like Shah Rukh Khan, let's take advantage of it. Shah Rukh Khan himself has denied the whole movie and said it was too out dated. He did not promote it , but they had the right to put his picture everywhere. Which they did and fooled a lot fans, unfortunately." 
" Not worthy of SRK!","As much as I love SRK..this film..well I was going to say sucks.. but thats putting it mildly! For Pete's sake, they even dubbed over SRK's speaking voice! Other than being able to actually look at SRK, there is nothing good about THIS film. Usually one can say "yeah but it had good songs", or "good dances", "a nice ending" or SOMETHING...but this film had SRK and that was it. But even at that, they put these huge glasses on him for some reason. This is one of those films that no amount of editing or re-shooting would have made things any better...story line, cinematography, costumes, sets...the lot...all bad.I swear they had Rs.10 to make this film!So save the popcorn and tears of frustration, unless your trying to complete the SRK film list...avoid (as Lucky says in Main Hoon Na...lol)." 
" Surprised ...","The movie had no story per say ... was boring from the beginning. Switching from scene to scene. Didn't expect Shahrukh to accept such a roll - movie had no meaning. A Flop ... we wanted to walk out in the first 10 mins. of the movie. The actors were actually just posing for the camera - no talent. Shahrukh did do a good job acting his roll, but you can't carry the movie without a proper story and star cast that knows how to act. Don't have to be famous, but atleast have some talent. We were excited that it was SRK's movie and went to see it. What a flop. We hoped it would get better, by the intermission. But no luck. The theater had a sign outside saying "no refunds on tickets for - Yeh Lamhe Judaai Ke" we wondered why? Now we know." 
" Could have been good.....but too late","This film could have been good if it was released when it was first made. Now, it looks very out-dated, the acting is poor, and the whole editing of the movie seems very rushed.The story is about Dushant (Shahrukh) and Jaya (Raveena) who are childhood friends and lovers but experience difficulties when Dushant becomes a popular singer and their two friends stir up trouble for them. Some more happens - but i'll leave that for you to watch.In this film, the voices don't even sound like Shahrukhs and Raveenas.Overall, it would have been best if this film was left on the shelf as thats the highest this film is going to go.Overall Rating? Minus 10 out of 10" 
" patchwork puzzle leaves you puzzled","this is unfortunately the worst film I have ever seen. No wonder, considering that it must have been assembled from snippets of a doomed project and a few scenes turned much later.. about ten years after beginning. The plot would have had some interest... but with huge and important pieces missing to give the whole sense it is just falling from one puzzling scene into the next one. The end is totally abrupt and makes no sense at all.The acting at the beginning is hilarious in its ineptitude. Later on it loses even this saving grace. At least SRK doesn't do too badly... but even the best actor would have a hard time carrying it through when there is no continuity... not Mr. Khan's fault... but I bet he wished he could have burned the thing.This is not a film... it is just a rip off for SRK fans. So be warned. If you consider buying it... save the money for something more worthwhile." 
" the worst film in the history of bollywood.","I thought this film was a shame on bollywood.I would never expect Shahrukh Khan to make such a disgrace film. I went to the cinema and after 20 minutes I got bored we were going to get out the cinema but we thought the film might get better,we were wrong. After another 15 minutes we were even more bored.We got out the cinema and so did nearly everyone else that was watching the film. What a waste of money.I think the best thing was the acting of Shahrukh Khan. I use to like Raveena Tandon but not anymore. My worst part of the film was every bit." 
" what a rip off!","This is the most awful movie I have ever seen in my life!!! I thought it seemed strange when Shahrukh didn't sound like himself and I finally realised that someone else's voice that had been used in the dubbing. I couldn't follow whatever story there is supposed to be. There is just no rhyme or reason to much of the character's actions and a movie without motivation being understood by the viewer is a waste of time. This was more than a waste of time - I feel like the producers owe me for the stress of watching this.Glad I only rented it.The only good thing in the whole movie are the two songs: 'Tere Naam Lene Ki'and 'Vaada' which I have on a music DVD. It was because of these and Shahrukh that I watched it and that is obviously what the producers were counting on when they released this half finished piece of crap. They should have been sued for letting it out of the can.Don't bother trying to watch it - it is an insult to anyone with half a mind." 
" A piece of crap","I wish there was minus points option in the voting. This was a disgrace. I rented it for SRK & Raveena but it was disgusting. I wanted to turn the VCR off after the first 10 minutes but waited another 10 minutes in the hope of some miracle. I quit after wasting 15-20 minutes.I thought of wasting another 5 minutes so it can help save someone some time whatever someone's capacity is to bear with this piece of crap.It is insult, even for an idiot's brain.Wonder what the director thinks about his masterpiece. Probably, that the audience was too retarded to understand it." 
" woth watching for other reasons","Okay, up front Yeh Lamhe Judaai Ke is not worth watching if you just want to watch a nice love story. But it is woth watching if you are Hindi cinema lover like i am and you know more about the film. Like earlier mentioned this film was started in 1992 with SRK and Raveena when they were newcomers. The film got shelved. 10 years later SRK is a big name (i wont go into the fact if THAT is justified or not yhough he is no Amitabh bachchan or Rishi Kapoor) and the film gets completed with another cast and is released. They throw in the scenes of SRK to make money. This is not the firt time this sort of thing happened. They did the same to the film Yaar Meri Zindagi with Amitabh Bachchan. The film started during his Bansi and Birju days and was released only 25 years later with Shatrughan Sinha making a fool of himself by shooting for this film for 3 decades. They did to Bachchan what they did to SRK in this movie.Another unreleased film was Rishi Kapoor's Chirag. What they did was they reshot al Rishis scenes with Govinda and took all the scenes he was not in and released the film as Beti No.1. We might even get another SRK movie like this because just like Jadoo (this movies original name in 1992)another soundtrack of a SRK movie was released in 1994 with music by Rakesh Roshan. The movie was Kisise Pyar Karke Dekho and SRK had shot for the film. The heroines were madoo and Ayesha Jhulka. But at least that movie has great songs by Asha Bhonsle, Pankaj Udhas, Sadhana Sargam, Mohd Aziz and others" 
" Couldn't even finish it :( !!","For all the fans out there who are in love with Shahrukh khan's acting I have to tell you that this movie is the most disappointing of his ever. From a personal point of view, I love to see Shahrukh's movies because I just adore his voice, looks and all the emotions he brings to his movies. However, the minute he started talking in "Yeh Lamhe Judaai Ke" I was heart broken, it wasn't even his. Another man dubbed for him and by the way this other man has a terrible voice that doesn't even suit Shahrukh's image. Also, I believe that the movie came out pretty late, and obviously it couldn't compete with all the modern movies then. Plus, the first song was totally unnecessary and really boring. Those were terrible memories of a movie that I couldn't even finish :(." 
" Decayed","The film was to be made in 1992 as Jadoo but then shelved due to Srk and Raveena refusing to do a kissing scene and now the filmmaker uses the footage of both and adds some new characters and releases the film in 2004 A week before Main Hoon Naa and of course bombed. The film has a story as old as hills but somehow the director tries to change things by adding a new cast however it annoys. There are scenes where characters are shown from the back and obviously there were not shot by the actors. Many scenes give an indication that they were never shot like a song where only Srk and Raveena's visuals were used, Also in the murder scenes of Mohinish and Navneet there are shown from far.Direction is bad Music by Nikhil Vinay is good but sounds outdated, 2 tunes from the film were used by Nikhil Vinay in Tum Bin later(which released in 2001)Shahrukh Khan looks straight out of Baazigar and is okay but his dubbing is done by some amateur which ridicules his act Raveena Tandon too doesn't impress and her dubbing is bad Mohinish Behl, Deven Bhojani all have been dubbed over Navneet Nishan is okay her voice too is dubbed, The new actors are non actors." 
" terrible","This movie was one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time. I could not stand Shah Rukh's voice, the plot was retarded, and the whole storyline was mixed up everywhere. The movie really ticked me and my family off. We were expecting a nice new movie from Mr. Khan but no, it was complete and utter garbage. The cover was nice, the music was very nice. The producers tricked us by releasing it in 2004, it was made obviously long before that. I wanted to turn off the movie many times during the course of watching it. I love shahrukh but damn, he should've paid the producers to not put the movie on shelves, it was an embarrassment to his acting, those his acting was fine, but his voice was annoying and the plot was horrid." 
" Half-baked, but not all bad","I bought this film in a discount 3-box (together with Ram Jaane and Army, which make much more viewing fun), and as usual read the comments here, all of which were devastating.I'm certainly not saying it's a good movie - but it isn't outright bad either. For a cineaste, it may be called "interesting" - when watching it, one tries to find indications of the meta-story as well."Jadoo" was somehow half-way produced in 1992 (the year SRK made his first movies - he won Filmfare Best Newcomer in 1993), and for some reason not finished, but shelved.12 years later, given the commercial value of SRK, it was reanimated and "somehow" turned into the movie "Yeh Lamhe Judaai Ke". Watching it, one may wonder which scenes were from the original, and which were padded in. (And which are obviously missing...) I see a three-part structure:(1) Childhood of the sisters Jaya and Sheetal, and their poorer friend Dushant (SRK), whom they help to get musical training. This roughly ends with the night "picknick" scene (where SRK funnily only watches and smiles), and Jaya sneaking in late only to meet the butler (a memorable role).(2) Ten years later: Dushant has become a top star singer, but also gives a miserable impression: cynical, depressed, alcoholic. He distrusts the people around him, who are really only interested in his fame and money. Nisha tries to draw him into a relationship, but he resists. Jaya tries to contact him, but gets intercepted by Nisha, who lies to Dushant that Jaya has only come to collect money. Dushant angrily pushes an attache case full of banknotes to Jaya and sends her away, totally desperate.(3) Now the criminal part begins (in which SRK almost never shows up): Nisha's father arranges for a truck driver to kill Jaya on her way out. Police open a case, star agent Rahul travels to the place where Sheetal (Jaya's younger sister) lives, and makes contact with her incognito. Throw in some romance. Meanwhile, the murders continue: Nisha, Sujit (a corrupt false friend of the gang), Nisha's father (the film let me think it was a heart attack, but later someone mentions he was stabbed to death). Rahul and Sheetal fly to Mumbai, she discovers rope and rubber gloves. Arrest. SRK comes back one last time to say "Thank you." - "For what?" - "For everything."The latter part is the most questionable - it just sketches a story, starts interesting subplots just to leave them open (e.g. the black-bearded truck driver crashing Nisha's father's birthday party...) I'm not advocating to buy this movie for enjoyment. But if you get it anyway (say as part of a DVD set), it was not boring for me, like many others wrote. It has memorable scenes (I liked Sheetal most, from little girl to grown-up), and for better understanding it even helps to watch it twice. But not much more, thereafter..."
