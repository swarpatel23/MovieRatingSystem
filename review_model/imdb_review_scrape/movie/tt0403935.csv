" Awful","If it were only a fraction of its length, "Action Jackson" would be of the sort of perfectly-bad movies ideal for riotously ripping into with a group of snarky-sarcastic friends. However, its 3 hour run time turns it into a psychologically torturous endurance test as it drags its dead carcass through enough plot clichés and randomly thrown-in twists for four films. Viewers lured in with the promise of a meet-cute Bollywood rom-com, will be confused and horrified when the body count reaches in the high hundreds. "Action Jackson" is actually a bizarre amalgamation of two Bollywood rom-coms, a stereotypical assassin- turned-good-guy out for revenge flick, and the Parent Trap. But with 007 Bond villains (I will admit, I enjoyed the super-campy villains). However, instead of a cohesive blending of these elements, it feels as if the random limbs from at least four different films were amateurishly hacked-off and thrown into a pile to rot together and produce this...thing.Watch an old guy with obviously CGIed abs (they move up and down on their own!) play not one, but two, action heroes badly, as he poses like a teen model every chance he gets and speaks only in garbled, bizarre, one-liners ("It's my way, or the Skyway." "Me, criminally bad." are some of the gems) and flirts with two much younger, extremely similar women the plot keeps forgetting about. The dancing is bad and makes no sense with the plot half the time, the lines are dubbed as poorly as an old kung-foo film and sometimes not translated at all, and most parts are so laughably wretched that you will openly mock the movie in order to stay sane.I nearly cried when I discovered there was still over an hour left. People walked out of the theater. "Action Jackson" could have been "the Room" of the Indian film industry, but is so long and crappy, it really isn't worth bothering with." 
" A pathetic film in every sense","As I begin writing my views on Parbhudeva's Action Jackson, the thought that do come to mind is that how silly and crap a movie can be made with massive budget , high cost production and popular star cast ? There are movies like Queen and Gangs Of Wasseypur with high quality content and shoe string budget and yet managed to impress the audience. Why do spend money on useless script and horrible stories and yet actors like Ajay Devgan are working with him ?Action Jackson is a masala entertainment telling the story of 2 look-alike. Life changes when they cross each other's part.From the critical acclaimed Wanted and entertainers like Rowdy Rathore and R..Rajkumar to disaster movie like Ramaiya Vastavaiya in which the definition of Story, Script and direction does not fit it. In Action Jackson, you will wonder how amateurish can Prabhudeva get. Imagine a scene where Sonakshi Sinha wants her luck to change only if she can see Ajay Devagan's g-part again. Editing is horrible. The torture goes on for almost 3 hours. Art direction is good. Cinematography is nice. Songs are pathetic. Ajay Devgan disappoints and disappoints big time. An actor of his calibre should be doing better films.Overall, a pathetic film in every sense. Poor- 1/5www.facebook.com/Filmychowk" 
" Na story na direction only loo breaks.....","Story: Vishi is a local goon who basically likes beating up people to get his work done but is nonetheless a kind-hearted person. On the other hand Khushi is an extremely clumsy girl who keeps losing her chances with destiny and gets suddenly lucky after she accidentally meets Vishi.Amidst the building chemistry between Khushi and Vishi, local cops and an international don named Xavier are on the look-out for AJ aka Jai who is a look alike of Vishi and is in the same city. The story takes a major turn of events when both AJ and Vishi come face to face.Will AJ's past create problems for Vishi's future?Performances: Ajay Devgn is a huge disappointment in this film. The otherwise brilliant actor seems too volatile in this role. Though he excels in the scenes which have action, the actor does not seem comfortable pulling off the comic undertones and it would be best left unsaid for the parts that he tries the 'Prabhudheva' style dancing.This is Sonakshi Sinha's third film with the director and sadly she shows no growth whatsoever. The actress essays her usual self and nothing extraordinary to it.Yami Gautam looks radiant in every frame that she is a part of.Debutante Manasvi Mamgai reveals quite a lot with her negative character. But her acting is extremely weak and it would be safe to say that you would find her heaving much more than speaking in the film.Direction Editing & screenplay: Unfortunately, this is the second time Prabhudheva fails me after his 2014 film Ramaiya Vastavaiya which was a flop. Even though I was hoping him to step up and make Action Jackson a second or an even better Rowdy Rathore, it couldn't come even a second close. He adds all his usual ingredients of action, comedy and Sonakshi Sinha but this time the recipe failed big time.If only the story was a little stronger, the film would have been worth a watch but when topped with its pathetic background score, even minutes turn to hours. The absurdity with which the songs have been included in the film is shocking.Gravity defying action sequences are a staple in his films and that is constant here too. There is a lot of play with lighting but is quite disturbing to see every action scene in a gloomy and rainy setting. The film is a drag for over two hours and that certainly talks quite a bit about the editing department.The last word: Action Jackson matches up to neither Prabhudheva's film making nor an Ajay Devgn film. It is an extreme downer for those expecting a full on action-packed 'masala' film. With a done to death plot and an absolutely nothing new to offer, the only thing that this film latches onto is Ajay Devgn who maintains his swagger well enough. I am going with a 3/10 for Action Jackson." 
" DUMB Jackson...","No Spoilers.There are many things that fly in this movie, including Sonakshi.The movie has pathetic script... unnecessary dialogs. What i could not understand is that "there was nothing to understand" in this movie. Ajay can not dance but is made to dance. The first half is OK but beware of second half. Action sequences defy Physics.Only saving grace is Yamy Gautam and Kunal Roy Kapur. They both have justified their roles. Yami looks fresh and energetic. Movie songs and background score is pathetic and not appealing. Composed with a feeling of loose character. Please stay away... watch only on TV release, where u can fast-forward it and waste less time! :) Cheers!" 
" Mr. Prabhu Deva please don't pollute our Bollywood","OK 1st of all I should say this if u compare this movie with Himmatwala,then Himmatwala looks a class movie ‪#‎Story‬ :- ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Story WTF is that??? they mixed Wanted,Rowdy Rathore, Chahat & many more films story & made this Film... wow **claps claps claps**‪#‎Direction‬ :- what more can u expect from a director like Prabhu Deva?? Now a days In Bollywood Ram,Shayam,Jadhu,Madhu everyone grabbing a producer & directing films... I am giving u an example how much bad director is Prabhu Deva... In the 1st scene he is showing that villain killed a girl by shooting her on the head & after intermission when the same scene is got repeated, it is showed that the bullet hit her on the back... just before the intermission there was a fight sequence where at least 100 people came to kill Ajay Devgan but none of them carried even a small gun with them wow‪#‎Action‬ :- Same typical South Indian action.... not even a single action looked realistic...‪#‎Acting‬ :- One & only Ajay Devgan did some good job to save this film.... Sonakshi Sinha over-acting Ki Dukan Kunaal Roy Kapoor's comedy acting will make you bore... ‪#‎Music‬ :- Himesh Reshammiya proved that he is there to destroy Bollywood music Lastly, 1) Ajay Devgan's break dance... Ohh god I don't know what to say... I was like (what the f he is doing) when I was watching him doing break dance... 2) Sonakshi Sinha is a very unlucky girl in the movie... But whenever she saw Ajay Devgan naked, her luck changed really??? She again wanted to see him naked because she wants to marry a guy who is from America... In this process one day she saw AD doing (a Munna Bhai sequence on the film :D) & fall in love with him... This is how today's director shows love in the movie" 
" Regressive, stupid and migraine-inducing.","Prabhu Deva, whom I admired a lot as the ace dancer of the world, after Michael Jackson, has come back as a director with another film called 'Action Jackson'. Wonder why you ask, it is because of two reasons:- 1) Ajay Devgn is playing the titular character, and 2) It has loads of action (evident from the trailers itself) and the cast of the movie dance like Jackson (I couldn't witness that in the 3-hours of migraine-inducing movie, though)Without further yak-yak, let's analyze the plot. The film starts off with the entry of Vishy (Ajay Devgn) in his regular fashion that's combined with élan and style. For reasons unexplained till almost the interval, Vishy is at the target point of many goons who follow him left, right and center to bump him off. As if this wasn't enough, there comes Khushi (Sonakshi Sinha) who 'experiences good luck' in succession after seeing Vishy 'family jewels'. With this, Vishy adds one more 'stalker' to his list! It's only towards the interval that the audiences get to know that Vishy has a doppelganger by the name of 'AJ', who by profession is a killer. And then it becomes clear that the goons actually mistook Vishy to be AJ and hence followed him everywhere. And when AJ and Vishy meet, the former explains the reason to the latter and his friend (Kunaal Roy Kapur) that since he refused to marry the dreaded goon and mafia kingpin Xavier (Anand Raj)'s highly obsessed sister Marina (debutante Manasvi Mamgai), the goons are out to kill him and the love of his life Anusha (Yami Gautam). Tracking down AJ in India, Xavier sends his henchmen to India to kill AJ, which is when AJ devises a plot with the help of Vishy to destroy Xavier and his crazy sister Marina and protect his wife and new born baby. Does the simple man Vishy say yes to be a part of this risk taking plan and go to meet Marina in a foreign country, does the dreaded villain Xavier get to know about the plan of the duo, does AJ get to save the love of his life and does Khushi become truly lucky and unite with Vishy again is what forms the rest of the story.After directing the intermittenly likable 'Wanted', quite forgivable 'Rowdy Rathore', chirpy-sweet-old-fashioned 'Ramaiya Vastavaiya', regressive and stupid 'R... Rajkumar', Prabhu Deva has dished out yet another regressive and migraine-inducing 'Action Jackson'. For all the reasons, this film will surely be banned, if there are sensible people to do so. For the reasons are:- a) Which educated woman on this world will find a man's crotch lucky for her career and her life. Women council, please take some 'action' against this movie. b) Why should we get awestruck by a kid who asks,'how many alphabets are there in English language'. Suckers would get awestruck, not me. And for information, there is just one alphabets, which has 26 letters to it. c) And there is a lady (debutante Manasvi Mamgai) who removes her shirt at the drop of a hat. What are you, lady Salman Khan? At least Ajay Devgn has a legit reason for stripping, as he has developed his abs, you don't even have that! d) Which girl on Earth would tolerate all the atrocities of the hero, including him abusing her house, and still love her? Is she a slut? And the list goes on, and on, and on.I have no problem with the film insulting our intelligence, even most of the Salman Khan starrers have committed such a sin, and I forgave these films. But what is appalling that women, in this movie, are portrayed as bimbos-with-a-tinge-of-slutty-attitude. This is the second movie after 'R... Rajkumar', where women are portrayed like this.Story-screenplay (A. C. Mughil, Prabhu Deva) is non-existent. Dialogues (Shiraz Ahmed) are abysmal. Cinematography (Vijay Kumar Arora, R. D. Rajashekhar) is jarring and shaky. VFX (Prime Focus World) is laughable and non-sensical. Editing (Bunty Nagi) is choppy and lacks cohesion. Stunts (Ravi Varma) are non-sensical. Music (Himesh Reshammiya) is just forgettable. Choreography (Vishnu Deva, U. Jogasekhar, VJ Sekhar) is just appallingly atrocious.Of the cast, no one acted well, especially Yami Gautam and Ajay Devgn.On the whole, 'Action Jackson' is for those who swear by entertainers like those stupid 80's South-Indian movies or those stupid 80's movies of Bollywood or movies like 'R... Rajkumar'. Please avoid it." 
" AJ- Absolutely Jejune","I would like to kick off this review by saying 'PLEASE AVOID THIS MOVIE'. This movie is completely bland and has nothing to offer. The plot is missing, acting is atrocious and dancing is redonkulous. I respectfully implore Prabhu Deva to come to his senses and stop this malarkey.The movie showcases Sonakshi Sinha as a Barbie doll (once again, huh) strutting across the screen being gullible to the extent of appearing pathetic. However she does show some great dance moves.Yami Gautam has a very small role to play most of which includes appearing as an arm-candy for AJ. She appears dolled up all the time. Things stretch too far when she appears in a hospital bed with lipstick and gloss. Got to take care of looks, huh Yami !!!Anand Raj portrays the role of main antagonist. His bald look with an odd tattoo appeared laughable.Kunaal Roy Kapur, frankly was the only saving point of this horrendous affair. His goofy appearance and funny dialogue delivery were the only saving grace for the movie. Although I have to agree that he went over the top a few too many times.AJ - Me Criminally Good. Movie Pitifully Bad." 
" Prabhu Deva- a director who is a disgrace to the Bollywood industry","I have been a fan of Masala films like Dabanng and Main Hoon Na but this one failed to lie in that genre. The execution and story of the movie were both atrocious to say the least. Very choppy editing that I have ever seen in my life. The action scenes are one of the biggest letdowns in the movie. The music is so ridiculous that made me thinking what HR had in his mind when being offered as a composer for Action Jackson. Ajay Devgan's performance is like Tiger Shroff and Fardeen Khan combined only in this movie although he previously did well in his other movies. I still remembered that cheesy line when Sonakshi said to Ajay that you dance better than Prabhu Deva. After hearing Punjabi Mast, yeah he sure does!!! Manasvi Mamgai was attractive in the movie but she had bad taste in acting her role. Prabhu Deva should leave the film directing sector and just stick to making peoples bodies move because that is the only thing he is good at. Lights, Camera, and Action and Prabhu Deva, there is a huge difference on how he does it. This film overall was an atrocity and a disgrace to North Indian Cinema and the world." 
" Why Ajay..Why ???","Half way through Action Jackson..the following questions popped up in my mind 1) What on earth is Prabhudeva smoking ? To be frank, Devgn is a double role on paper is a good idea but everything is lost after that.2) Why does Prabhudeva want to torture us with such films? Last yr..it was R Rajkumar and now Action Jackson?3) Why does Sonakshi Sinha and Yami Gautam act is such non sense films? Frankly both are decent actress but Action Jackson is a blot on their careers.4) What is Kunal Roy Kapoor doing in this film ? 5) And, finally...why Ajay ? Why r u acting in such crap films ? You once did some fabulous films. But now Rascals, Son of Sardaar, Himmatwala and now Action Jackson are just undoing the gr8 work u did till date.This movie may not be injurious to your health but definitely to your mind !! Stay away." 
" 2/10","A complete washout for me. I simply didn't get into this film. It has decent fight scenes but reliance on wire work and visual effects is obvious. Almost nothing else works. The acting by everyone is weak. Devgn is flat and seems disinterested. The 'comedy' in the film is unfunny.Not recommended2/10" 
" Prabhu Deva & Ajay Devgan falter with Action Jackson","When we have a Prabhudeva movie what one expect is mere entertainment. The movie takes inspiration from Prabhudeva's own work - entertaining Rowdy Rathore and Rajkumar. We have our hero Ajay Devgan playing double role. One is small time goon - Vishy, in love with Sonakshi Sinha and other is Right hand of don - Action Jackson. Don's sister has fallen for Action Jackson and wants to own him by killing his wife - Yami Gautam. How Paths of two characters of Ajay Devgan cross each other and help Action Jackson save his wife from don forms the story line of the movie. The main story is around Action Jackson's attempt to save his wife from don and of course kill the don, then why spend almost one hour setting up the romance between Vishy and Sonakshi Sinha which adds nothing to the story. In fact it is a cheap track where an unlucky Sonakshi Sinha discovers her luck on seeing Vishy Pants down and from there on keep following him to catch him pants down and of course fall in love later. Vishy as a playful character is so fond of dancing that he dances even when fighting and believe me he is a complete misfit and a BIG FAIL in this Akshay & Salman kind of character. His non existent dancing talent and comic bone make things worse.Just before the interval we get a fight scene similar to Rowdy Rathore but impact is no where near it and is way Over the top than Rowdy Rathore pre-interval fight. There was a news before the release that Ajay Devgan learned sword fighting for the movie but even the sword carrying Action Jackson performs same over the top action with men flying and bouncing on being hit. Director really missed the chance here to include some good sword fights which at least would have given a USP to a routine Action masala fare. Background music seems to be lifted from 80's movie and was really irritating. Songs are bad not worth listening. Don in the movie looks like a D grade movie comedian rather than a menacing threat and the vamp played by Mansvi carries just one seductive look all throughout. Ajay Devgan looks cartoon as Vishy and is decent as Action Jackson as the character is in his comfort zone requiring an intense look. Sonakshi Sinha went hamming at places but was decent overall despite being repetitive. Yami Gautam doesn't have much to do.To sum it up i would say Prabhudeva breaks his streak of entertaining masala fare with this one. AVOIDABLE MOVIE" 
" Pathetic film","The weekend when this movie got released, we all cousins and met together after a long long time(re-union) & had planned to watch a film together. Since no other Bollywood film had released during Action Jackson release, we had no choice but to watch this film. An entire row was booked.The movie started & i had little bit of hope that, something logical & something which makes sense will be there in this film. But my poor, none of the things made sense to me! Such a pathetic film! Oh man, i wanted to get out of theatre just after first 15mins into film. The second half was total torture. What happened to Ajay Devgan? He is such a fine actor.By watching Action Jackson, it made me realize that R Rajkumar is somewhat "watchable" film compared to this and trust me R Rajkumar is also pathetic film.Only those few comic relief by that hero's friend made me smile a bit. Other than that, its just pathetic & absolute mindless,senseless film. I would have given 0 star, but IMDb doesn't provide it.Once i came out of theatre, i said in my mind, "OH GOD, Why did you punish me like this?". I regret to this day, that i spent my precious time of 150mins watching this bakwas movie!" 
" Disappointing!!!","I said disappointing for a reason and that is, when you see a film starred by Ajay Devgan, Directed By Prabhu Deva, You naturally start to think that the film should be 'Interesting, A Must Watch' Should Be Good' that kind of thoughts easily comes to our mind because we expect something different something spectacular to be delivered, But if we can't get that then disappointment comes naturally and that is obvious.I'm not saying that the film was Bakwaas, Total Crap, Utterly Disgusting like the other reviewers here. But I'm sorry to say that it was truly not enough to be memorable one. Let me come to the details first..There are several Pros and Cons, I'll try to enlist as much as possible...So?Let's come to the points quickly...Cons....1. Music was Average {Could've been better}.2. First half was something fresh but looks dull with silly dialogs and witty expressions.3. I personally think Kunaal Roy Kapur's character was unnecessary and was totally wasted.4. Sonakshi Sinha was good in her part of role but seems to be repetitive.5. The Main Antagonist does not look like a villain at all. He misses the charm of Bad Character. {Prakash Raj Would've been a better choice}.6. Editing was fuzzy.7. The film has 2 Hour and 26 Mins of Run Time and that is something that feels dragged a little bit.Now the {+} points...Pros....1. New type of actions were great to watch. Action Sequences were executed properly.2. Ajay Devgan truly justified his role, I doubt if any other actor can carry the role to that level.3. Yami Gautam acted very well in her small but effective role.4. Even the leading bad lady, I mean Manasvi {She's damn hot really :D} did her job well.5. I did not like the first half, actually it was slow and dull but the second half was good and catches up the pace it needs.After all if you are either a Ajay Devgan or Prabhu Deva Fan then You should watch it, you will enjoy the film, but don't keep so much expectations as I did :{ you will be disappointed as much as I am now!!!" 
" A treat for AJ's fans","Action Jackson is a disappointing film.Prabhudeva had put all his mas-ala ingredients to make an entertaining film but failed miserably.The script of the movie is very weak.The film is full of silly dialogues and action scenes.Today bollywood is losing its charm due to silly films.Generally every film has a story lifted from other movies.If they want to put bollywood on world map then they have to make original movies instead of mindless action flicks.Prabhudeva has always made mindless movies and this one is no exception.The story is bad but the screenplay is not as bad as the story.First half of the movie is very bad but second half was better which saved the movie from drowning.Action scenes were too over the top,unconvincing and violent.Comedy was little better than action.The twist in the end is the worst and totally unconvincing.Ajay looked good in action but was weak in other scenes.I don't understand why he wastes his time in such bad movies.Sonakshi was very bad.She has become typed with same kind of roles.She didn't had enough to do except dancing,romancing,speaking dialogues with wooden expression and making 1000 types of bad faces.Manasvi was excellent.She looked hot as well as lethal.Anand raj was below average.Yami gautam was gorgeous.She looked radiant in every frame.Music was horrible.Direction of the movie was also very weak.Overall a movie which is inspired from various movies like Rowdy rathore and Kill bill.If you are die hard AJ's fan then you may go for it otherwise wait for the DVD.This movie again proved that prabhudeva is a great dancer but should quit direction.A bad experience....... RATING : 5.6 out of 10" 
" Excellent Movie","Action Jackson is a 2014 Indian action masala film directed by Prabhu Deva and produced by Gordhan Tanwani and Sunil Lulla.. It features Ajay Devgn in a double role, alongside Sonakshi Sinha, Yami Gautam and Manasvi Mamgai as the female leads.Action Jackson is an amazing movie. All the songs are wonderful, lovely and good dance. The action that Ajay Devgan did was just outstanding. This movie does have a bit of comedy. Sonakshi's didn't play a good role. The villain's look was, the way he was shown in the movie and the way he talked was nice.The movie was thriller and a lot of action. So overall this movie was just amazing and i think people go and should watch this movie." 
" First half is fresh but second half is little clumsy","Director Mr.Prabhu Deva work is good. Story has lots of things, which go overboard. Dialogues by Shiraz Ahmed, are OK. Screenplay by Prabhudeva, Shiraz Ahemed and A.C Mughil, offers something new. First half entertains only due to innovative approach of most of the scenes. The main track of luck factor is logical and comical both. Even they try to convey few messages through it. Messages are subtle but good. In the scene, when a kid got refused admission from school on the basis of illiterate father, then the way hero convinces the Principal is appealing. Fighting style with music beats is also new and entertaining. Interval point indicates that now movie is ready to land in the illogical and unnecessary violence area. The main conflict in second half is unreliable. A person never became ready to take risk of his life only for humanity ground and even with his friend. Yeah, we got some comical relief in second half due to this duo but there was no logic at all and it downgraded the villain character too. Climax fight is just like cake walk rather than some brain game in action sequences or in screenplay. Performance wise Ajay Devgan will surprise you with his unique and entertaining style of dancing. He is candidly endearing. Sonakshi Sinha looks beautiful and fits completely in her bubbly character. Yami Gautem looks pretty and acts good. Kunal Roy Kapoor is very good. Manasvi Mamgai as Marina, wears perfect attitude and expression. Music by Himesh Reshmmiya is good and choreography makes it very good."
