" The Most Underrated Movie Of The Year","I must say that I am extremely surprised by the negative reviews 'Sirf' has received for it is one of the better Indian movies of the year. It sort of falls in the same line of 'Life... In A Metro', but the situations here are far more real (compared to the dramatic ones in 'Metro') and while the execution of 'Life... In A Metro' is better where technical finesse is concerned, 'Sirf' scores more points where originality is concerned. I'm not saying that 'Life... In A Metro' is less of a movie as the stories are different while the main theme of urban life in modern India (both movies are set in Bombay) and interconnecting stories are the key resemblance. Additionally, director Nayyar briefly touches the theme of jealousy by briefly displaying how the different couples envy each other while they all have their own struggles. 'Sirf' gives us a glimpse into the lives of four couples living in metropolitan Mumbai:Rahul (Ankur Khanna) is a young man who is in desperate need of work and money within three months in order to secure a home with his fiancée, Shalu (Nauheed Cyrusi). If this condition is not met, then Shalu's parents will wed her to someone else. When Ankur finally gets his opportunity, his integrity is put to test. This story, though interesting, is the weakest of all. The character of Shalu appears to be a little too whiny. She's working as a receptionist in a hospital. So why can't she do anything to help Rahul instead of pressuring him to come up with the entire sum? Relative newcomer Ankur Khanna does a brilliant job as he holds his own as part of an ensemble of accomplished actors. Nauheed Cyrusi is alright.Akash (Ranvir Shorey) and Namita (Sonali Kulkarni) are two working parents who have a young daughter with a heart condition (that could be fatal given the amount of stress). I liked how this story that shows a modern working couple's struggle to balance their working hours with quality time to spend with their daughter and in the process their is the additional stress of a marriage that is at steak. Akash and Namita are both hardworking loving parents who love their daughter but perhaps it is their miscommunication that has made their marriage fragile. When gradually, both take some time off work for their little girl, their bond strengthens and at the same time things also get better at work but matters concerning health should not be delayed. Both Shorey and Kulkarni are excellent as they play their parts to the T. Amit (Parvin Dabas) and Suchita (Rituparna Sengupta) are newly weds. Suchita's new experience in the big city and her disapprovment of modern urban culture does not gel well with Amit while Suchita is struck by insecurities concerning Amit. This story is presented with a touch of comedy and Rituparna Sengupta is hilarious as the naive housewife who experiences culture shock and then starts getting jealous of her husband and his coworker. Parvin Dabas is good too as the husband who tries to put up with Suchita's complaints while at the same time avoiding her by burying himself in work. The last story concerns a rich couple, Akash (Kay Kay Menon) and Devika (Manisha Koirala). They have money, wealth, a comfortable lifestyle, all the things middle-class working people in Mumbai dream of. But there is a love lost somewhere. between. While an ambitious Akash spends days and nights with work a neglected Devika suffers the consequences of a fragile marriage. The story does bare some resemblance with the Akash-Namita story but the difference in class is well-portrayed. Many have drawn parallels between Kay Kay Menon's Ranjeet (from 'Life... In A Metro') and Gaurav but even though both the characters are burying themselves in work with a frustrated wife waiting at home, Gaurav is far more likable and more human He clearly loves his wife (as was evident in the scene when Devika mentions the abortion, his initial reaction is concern for his wife's health rather than anger) and his excuse for being an ambitious workaholic is that it provides financial security for the family while he entirely forgets his most important role as a husband. Both Kay Kay Menon and Manisha Koirala are fantastic and their growth as actors is evident.The writing is very good. I liked the dialogues and the stories connect quite well. It's disappointing that the movie didn't get much recognition. Perhaps, 'Sirf' would have benefited more with the availability of further financial resources but director Nayyar has done a fine job by telling a story that the common man/woman can relate to and kudos to him for creating an ensemble of some of the best working actors, and extracting solid performances from them." 
" pretty okay",""Sirf," directed by Rajaatesh Nayar shows us a concept that tends to apply to our competitive modern-day society: Sometimes we think that the other side of the grass is greener when the person on the greener side is looking at us. Did this movie do a good enough job of executing this concept? Not wonderfully, but except for a couple of flaws, it is pretty good. Anyways, the movie's all about these four couples of different socioeconomic backgrounds living in the same city in India, and they are all connected. How? Well, the movie starts off with the economically unfortunate couple, who meet the middle class couple and envy them, and the middle class people meet the upper middle class people and envy them and it goes on and on and onThere are a few points when the higher class people envy the lower class people thoughAnyways, as it turns out, all couples are facing challenges of their own and the movie does a good job of clearly showing us what these problems are, and the problems are quite practical. But something that I felt was really lacking was quality entertainment. "Sirf" drags way too much and at times, tries to incorporate the clichés of Indian drama instead of making it about real people." 
" Not too bad for the silly season!","Bollywood has yet to surprise us for the year 2008. After Taare Zameen Par, we have seen nothing to quench the thirst of cine-goers. Well, for those of you who are planning to watch Sirf, it isn't all that bad or let me say, not as bad as Tashan. It is the story about unfulfilled dreams. It is the story about not so content people, who are just not satisfied with the way things are in their life. It is also about breaking away from the monotony of one's life in such a way that it can ruin one's life. This movie could have been executed better, but the acting of Ranvir Shorey, Kay Kay Menon and Sunali Kulkarni has certainly made it a watchable movie!!!!"
