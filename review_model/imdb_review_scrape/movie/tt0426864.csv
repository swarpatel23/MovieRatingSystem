" For insomniacs only...","...and that only as a last resort.I have seen a LOT of bad films. But rarely do I see one that in which can't find something to like. It would be impossible to write a spoiler for Akhiri Inteqam if for no other reason than its completely predictable plot. The short version: girl meets boy, girl's family disapproves, girl's family's rivals kill boy (for reasons that are never completely clear)then assault girl for good measure. Girl plots revenge. Result much mayhem. Poorly scripted and even more poorly acted mayhem at that. The requisite "training montage" takes cues from Jennifer Lopez in "Enough", Sylvester Stallone in the original "Rocky" -- complete with a chicken chasing scene -- and every other bad 80's underdog action film. At the end of it all our heroine has been transformed from shrinking violet to commando in a B-cup, and still hasn't learned how to properly hold an assault rifle. She's apparently not learned how to shoot it very well either, as we see her miss her intended target multiple times at point blank range despite blazing away on full-automatic. Even the nom d'voyage she chooses -- "Jallad" (loosely translated in the subtitles as "Terminator") -- is laughable.To round out the Bollywood Masala formula we must have the comedic relief -- in this case supplied by an unconvincing Johnny Lever clone -- and at least one song and dance number, but even that can't save this movie. The number itself features the heroine and her boyfriend dancing to the required love song, which is standard enough. But the song visualization is embedded in the scene where the heroine is being gang raped and the boyfriend we will soon learn has been murdered. A cheery counterpoint to a musical pledge of undying love, hai na? To sum up, why I sat through 2 hours of mind-numbing dialog, amateurish special effects, horridly contrived fight scenes and a story line that is barely discernible is the biggest mystery this film provides. I suppose I was waiting for it to get better.It didn't."
