" don't watch","i cannot believe anyone liking anything in this film. when i see the rankings above 1, i am thinking you meant it as a prank. there's no story line, the music is mediocre, the screenplay is bad and the acting is yet to be learned. the only thing decent is the choreography, but if thats a pull i am sure there are ton of movies that you can watch for that. in order to get this comment published i have to write at least 1000 words and to be honest, it becomes extremely difficult to criticize something that is so bad. i agree that most films being churned out don't have any story but have it so bad is amazing. for me the really big downer with films these days is the lack of acting skills. I guess, i'll stick to my 1960s and 1970s films."
