" A surprisingly brilliant stuff! One of the best in thriller genre.","When Anil Kapoor will look down on his Bollywood's career lane, this work will remind him of the actor he always had in him.This is one of those rare movies from Bollywood that remained completely honest to the genre. So different that if this was dubbed in English many including me would have considered it to be a Hollywood venture without having a moment of doubt, because you wouldn't find anything in it that is typical trademark of Bollywood like unnecessary inclusion of dance numbers, songs, desperate attempt to switch between genre to serve a good for nothing masala (spicy) stuff, and most importantly the running time.Although every cast member gave their best not to forget Boman Irani who was slowly making his mark in the Indian film industry (now a well established brand), it was Anil Kapoor all the way who made this work so mesmerizing." 
" A lost gem, and easily one of the best of the Factory movies","Every year, Ram Gopal Verma's Factory churns out so many movies of varied quality that the average quality level of these movies ends up being, well, quite average. It does give a lot of aspiring filmmakers a chance to put their skills in use, but the downside is that gems like Ek Hasina Thi get lost in the dust of movies like James. My Wife's Murder is one such lost gem, and easily one of the best of the Factory movies (including the ones directed by RGV).Plot Summary: Ravi Patwardhan (Anil Kapoor) is a film editor with a wife (Suchitra Krishnamoorthi) who nags him for every minute he is at home. One such day, she irritates him to the point where he loses his cool and slaps her involuntarily ending up with a dead wife: she falls with a fatal damage to her skull. Now here is a man stuck in his own bedroom in the middle of the day with a dead wife and children about to arrive from school. And this is just the first 15 minutes. The rest of the movie is about Ravi trying to cover his deed and hide the truth from his children (8yrs & 4 yrs), from the in-laws, and from the police. Boman Irani plays Inspector Tejpal Randhawa who smells the fish and tries to smoke out the criminal. Nandana Sen plays Ravi's Editing apprentice.While watching this movie I realized that its director, Jijy Philip, is not just a man who knows how to make a good movie, but he loves & reads cinema too. This you realize with the subtle and quite unexpected references & homage to Tarantino, Shyamalan & Hitchcock (and maybe others I couldn't identify) without once stooping to rip-offs. Jijy even sets his own style, and then cunningly plays with the audience's mind by side-stepping his own style in a few key scenes. This mix and a completely original style makes this movie and the man behind it a must for fans of Cinema and specifically of the thriller genre. He also comes up trumps in extracting performances from his cast, be it the seasoned Anil Kapoor, yuppie Nandana Sen or even the 8-year old son.Anil Kapoor has not been this good and convincing since Eeshwar. His subtle and underplayed Ravi is a character that lives by compromise rather than conflict. He breathes a humility in Ravi that brings home the audience's empathy for his guilt and desperate state, such that was only a staple of method actors. Yet his performance is lost out on acclaim due to the misplaced glory in Bollywood Superstars. Sigh.Anil Kapoor's guilt-ridden protagonist is made that much more believable partly due to Suchitra Krishnamoorthi's short but highly irritating and therefore highly effective role as Ravi's wife. Nobody wants her dead, but her death evokes sympathy for her accidental-killer more than anything. Boman Irani sheds his comic image within a few frames of his entry and continues to defy the lowly standards of Bollywood character roles. His cop is a realist and logical man who hounds his suspect as the want of a real (good) cop would be. The alluringly beautiful Nandana Sen (who I have not seen in any other movie) also plays a realistic character of the rich but earthly editing assistant to Ravi. Does her Reena just look up to Ravi, or is there a subdued crush too? Is her boyfriend's jealously well founded? Her character, like all others in the movie, are well fleshed out to make them real enough to be believable. This helps the director in dealing with the audience directly - he holds on to us not letting go for a single minute in the entire 103 minutes (only!) of this songless movie.The director also uses a visual style quite alien to Hindi movies: using camera movements to forward the story, follow a character in a steadycam shot or to simply include the audience in the scene. He paints the movie void of any bright colours - there's nothing cheerful about what is unfolding on screen. The background score also plays the build with one particular scene having a clear Signs influence. Gone are any lumbering shots of the car driving down an entire road. We see it enter, and then we see it exit. The editor and the director acknowledge their audience to be intelligent enough to fill the gaps. What it does accomplish is a shorter and tighter movie, and a mostly edge-of-the-seat thriller.Watch this movie. It is very interesting to delve into the mind of a middle-class humble accidental murderer - especially if he is Hindi speaking. If you like it, talk about it to your friends. Word-of-Mouth may just get this flop movie enough of a following to warrant the Director another effort. It would be worth it." 
" Best Movie of the Year.","Just a 2 second flash of Anil's face after his wife slaps him was enough to tell me MWM, at the very least, would feature a stunning performance from Anil Kapoor. And right I was. This is the best male performance of the year. Anil's ability to convey so much through subtle changes of his face and body is like watching beautiful art unfold on the screen. There are moments in the movie where he just falls apart....its really something to watch. Ur heart goes out to his character. And this tremendous performance is further enhanced by the overall product MWM is. Well etched characters, excellent background music, technically slick(RGV production after all) and a screenplay so brilliantly written that there isn't a single boring frame in the entire movie. Every scene builds the tension and gets the viewer engrossed into the characters' lives like few movies have. Director Jijy Philip deserves BIG TIME kudos for perfectly executing this realistic thriller and extracting superb performances from the entire cast(even the cute little KIDS rock). Boman Irani continues to amaze me with his ability to BECOME every character he plays. It's hard not to love this guy. The girl who played Rani's younger sister in Black(don't know her name) is very solid as well....and I especially love how her and Anil's relationship is portrayed throughout.Bottomline, MWM is a must-see. A simple story taken to great heights with an award worthy screenplay and spectacular performances from everybody, especially Anil and Boman." 
" Give the man an award...","Director Jijy Philip impresses with his debut thriller. People who were expecting a suspense film would be disappointed. The makers from the start said that the film goes into Ravi's mind. It's more psychological then thrilling. It's great to see that movies like these are being made these days. No outdoor shootings, no actors dancing around trees, just simply good film-making and performances. Anil Kapoor is beyond great. He lives Ravi, he breathes Ravi. His facial expressions are amongst the best in Bollywood (Amitabh is good at this too). But this role was made for Anil and only Anil. The climax scene you get to see how great of an actor Anil is. He just shines in the climax, that will certainly bring tears in your eyes. The situation this character was in is just amazing, and that is due to the great screenplay and storyline. Editing and cinematography are ace, while background score is praise-worthy. Suchitra in her short role leaves an impact, while Nandana Sen lives up to her character. Boman shines in his well-written role. The film is gripping throughout, but it's the climax that should be talked about over and over again. I watched the climax scene about 5 times, I just can't get enough of Anil's performance. I would rate this as his second best performance in his career. Eeshwar being first, My Wife's Murder being second, and Pukar being third. Two people who deserve awards are Jijy Philip and Anil Kapoor, if these two go empty handed this year it would be really sad." 
" A multiplex hit","The title itself proves that it is not a typical bollywood movie. It comes from the factory of Ram gopal varma, for whom thinking unusually is usual. Even though the story-line is simple, the screenplay keeps the audience glued to their seats. The movie doesn't have even a single boring moment. Almost every frame is relevant to the story( though Boman Irani's personal life is shown, which may seem irrelevant, it IS relevant ).The characters are well etched, especially those of Anil kapoor, Suchitra, Nandana sen and Boman Irani. The story is very realistic but for the climax, where it slightly deviates to the typical bollywood clich√©. Overall, the movie is really good. But it may not be a hit in the suburban and rural areas because of the inherent morbidity in the movie." 
" Very realistic movie....","Well....I know it's based on a real incident.... but still I would like to say that right from the beginning till the end I keeps your mind fully occupied and no where makes you feel "It's so unrealistic". In fact the attitude of Anil Kapoor's wife too has been portrayed in a very realistic way which leaves a deep impact on your mind. I have seen minor version of such wives who do not trust there husband or people who have negative attitude for everything and are very fussy.Though the movie made me a little tensed I liked the concept of the movie as a whole. But, a little more comedy would have been appreciable.The movie has a lot to learn from each of the characters, specially the impact of communication on husband-wife relationship." 
" Awesome","In early 2000sm RGV Factory came out with several films which were out of the box and gave a chance for new directors and several talented people. MWM was one such film, directed by Jijy Philip. The film is awesome and the best part it's identifiable, Anil-Suchitra scenes are terrific, their family isn't a Sooraj Bharjatya type or KJO type happy family or melodramatic but a normal family. The twist is superb, till the interval the film keeps you on the edge, post interval it does slacken and get predictable but the end again is superb. Only flaws are perhaps the director could've avoided Boman's personal story but yet this are minor hiccups.Direction is awesome Background music is good, though at times a bit overdone Camera-work is awesome though RGV"s hangover does showAnil Kapoor gives one of his career best performances, he is simply mindblowing and flawless, the best part being he lives the role to perfection. Suchitra has a small role and she is decent Nandana Sen is decent, Rajesh is okay Boman Irani is terrific as the cop who likes to eat, rest are all decent Master Zain is simply outstanding" 
" Fabulous Suspense Movie","This is the best RGV movie since Company, and ranks in quality with Satya, which was a better movie than Company (though Company will always be a favorite of mine). Warning, though. If you get a knot in your stomach when watching suspenseful movies (like I do), you may have a difficult time watching this. Its like walking on glass all the way through. But Anil showed again why he's top rank in Bollywood. I really don't think anyone else could have done this role as well. And the rest of the cast, including Boman Irani and Nandana Sen, gave some of their best performances, too. Even the kids were well-directed. If there were justice in the world, this would be a candidate for a critical award next year." 
" Captivating movie.","I saw Anil Kapoor in "Om Jai Jagdish", "Rishtey" and "Armaan", three movies that he excelled as an actor. If there are two Actors that have the range and the depth-that would be him and Urmila Matondkar. The title is misleading since the movie is more moralistic than a thriller-but there are some tense moments that I will not divulge. The Ravi's character should have had more background-we should have seen his good time and bad times with Suchitra instead I felt like I walked in late to the theatre and missed something. Boman Irani's character in the lines of "Columbo" with Peter Falk, fills the slower or less tensedull parts. Anil Kapoor is riveting to say the least. After AB, he is the finest actor to grace the Indian Screen. Yet another good movie by RMG Banner." 
" Cinema to its best.","I don't usually write reviews for movies, but this movie is one that I loved so much that I had to write a review. When I saw Swades, I thought that was great cinema -- India is finally catching on. Then I saw Black, Parineeta, Sarkar -- and I believed the same for those. However, this movie is beyond good and great cinema, it's excellent. Don't get me wrong, I would say I liked Black and much as Swades as much as Parineeta as much as Sarkar as much as My Wife's Murder. However, this was a little different approach.It isn't your average Indian film where a rich production company hires the best composer, hit director, famous actor and great technical people and says to them, "go make the next thriller. I want people watching the movie 10 times a day. They should be listening to its music more and that, admiring the technical work and praising the actor". So, obviously was the case with several unnamed movies. My Wife's Murder is different, very different. It's one of the Hollywood-type movies which makes you think, but unlike several others, it's story was actually written in Bollywood, fair to say it's not a copy.India has done several great hits, and even though people may think this is another Bollywood movie, they are wrong. The technical work is excellent. Direction possibly even better. Acting superb (even from the policeman to the children to the main character). And what else can I say.It's the story of Ravi, who owns an editing studio. If there is one thing he likes working. He has only one assistant with whom his wife, thinks and believes he is having a love affair with. One day, when they are fighting about this, an accident occurs. You will have to watch the movie to find out the rest. 10/10 for me." 
" My Wife's Murder","The sad subject of this offering is a film engineer, a henpecked father of two whose paranoid shrew of a wife accuses him unremittingly of sleeping with his younger, attractive assistant. There is absolutely nothing going on between the two, but after pushing him too far, he strikes her, she falls back, hits her head, and we have one dead wife bleeding on the carpet.What he should do now, but of course doesn't, is summon the emergency services; he might even talk his way out of it, but he decides to dispose of the body, incredibly ineptly for a man who should know better. Having no option but to report her missing, he does so, and her body turns up quickly. At this point the detective on the case should have turned up at his home with a warrant, and that would have been the end of it, but perhaps they do things differently in India. At any rate, the assistant is drawn unwittingly into the plot, then wittingly covers for him. Obviously this can have only one outcome, and it is not a good one, rather amusing though is the way English creeps into the dialogue in many places. Okay, it is the lingua franca of the Universe, but it may be that fifty years from now every living language contains a smattering of it, those that don't already. There is also a cameo breakfast scene in which the detective, taking an ear-bashing from his own nagging wife, realises what has probably happened and is obviously thinking there but for the grace..." 
" Not "even" suitable for TV - audience discretion advised","After the first few reels, one feels that full blown movie was an overkill for the plot and perhaps telly was best suited. Mid-way you feel that its not even suited for small-screen. As you reach to the end of it, you feel that it was unwise to have attempted it. After a point, not only it starts to drag but also gets silly. And the lame ending sinks the movie further deep.Anil Kapoor delivers a noteworthy performance. Perhaps one of the first times I have seen a resilient character who uses more of body language to communicate.Suchitra Krishnamurthy leaves an impression as a nagging wife. Pity she gets bumped by the time you settle in with the popcorn's.Nandana Sen is a perfect cast for the role. Sadly its the writing of the character which doesn't fit very well.Rajesh Tandon does a good job for the character he is given.Boman Irani gets to play an interesting character. Sadly he is not the brightest crayon to solve the mystery (and as rightly pointed by his wife in the movie, gets job promotions for other reasons).Its only the performance of the actors which saves the movie. There is no doubt that technically the movie is top-notch, especially coming from RGVs Factory its kinda expected. Pity if content would have given at least half of the attention, it would have a different story altogether.Its not yet aired on small screen yet, and no rocket science to guess why!" 
" excellent suspense","This film has a very Hitchcock feel to it and delivers much of the same amount of suspense as the master himself. Though the 'mystery' of the murder is solved in the title, the story is more about a man's emotional turmoil over having made a grave mistake and a social commentary on fears of injustice.I found it interesting that the protagonist's predicament with his murdered wife was closely parallel to the investigator's own relationship with *his* wife. In fact, on further inspection, one can see that all of the relationships in this film are twisted or uneven, seemingly happy and normal on the surface only to have undercurrents of stress and underlying mistrust.Casting was incredible, the acting perfection. The theme is very dark and is not typical of your usual Bollywood film, and for this alone it is worth watching. A very suspenseful, thought- provoking film." 
" Different but predictable.","OK, it was different from the regular crap Bollywood produces so often. But the problem is, I've been seeing so many crime-based programs on television these days that this one appears pale and stale as compared to those. In fact any randomly chosen crime-file appears to be more interesting than this one.+ Acting. Good. Especially Anil Kapoor, He has done a good job playing the role of a unhappy husband, who accidentally kills his wife, and then tries eliminating all proofs of her murder. The movie is bearable only because of him. Boman Irani is impressive, and is able to keep the interest alive in a otherwise monotonous plot. Rest of the cast is quite poor, even Suchitra Krishnamurti appeared to be putting much more effort than required playing a irritating and suspicious wife.+ Camera-work. OK. Manages to capture the tension between the characters, and the uncomfortable environment. Also some night shots are really well taken.+ Sound Effects. Good. But then even 'Naina' had great sound effects.= Direction. Average. The start is good, and appears to be gripping, at least for the first half. However thereafter the director has completely lost his control over the flow, and the climax? just don't talk about it. There are numerous loopholes that you can observe. The hero runs away in a jeep someone has left on the road. Now who the hell leaves a vehicle with the ignition key keyed in. Anyways that happens very so often in bollywood (and even in Hollywood ) movies. During the chase scene, it is so evident that there is no more than 5 second time difference between the two vehicles; but when the jeep hits a rock and rolls over, the hero gets a full two minutes of escape time. What were the policemen doing for that much time? buying vegetables??Thrill. Little. And that mostly is the fault of the poor and monotonous second half, where the hero tries hiding the facts and the policeman is determined to uncover every single proof.Script. Too predictable. No dramatic elements. The moment, the guy tells his secretary about the murder, you know what way the things are going to happen. And then on, there is not even a single incident that you have not known in advance.I know there are people who say, "ok but thats the way it happens in real life. It was close to realty." Fine; but then whats the entire point of my watching a movie? Why shouldn't I choose a 11'o clock crime-scene program on television instead of spending money on this movie? Afterall I get to see exactly the same thing there, free of cost.Good movies are meant to be watched a thousand times and not just once; and I really can't rate a movie high, if it has nothing left for a second viewing. This one is definitely not a match for those.If all you are going to do is, to pick a crime investigation report and make a movie out of it, then all I can say is : "sorry! you can't get a better rating from me."" 
" Not good","I had some expectations from this movie but it is useless... seems like a news story about an accidental murder.. acting is OK from all main actors. There are no songs which is a good thing. The main problem is story, the person accidentally kills his wife who always suspects him for affair with his assistant. and then how the person is trying to escape from law and how he involves his assistant in this makes the rest of the story.. It is very slow at times.Also sometimes it gives feeling as if director is trying to make it a horror movie or something like that. And those crazy door shutting sounds ( reminds me of Vaastu Shastra )... they will drive you crazy once again.. guess the RGV effect.. I'd not recommend it to any one.My advice - stay away from it.. 5/10" 
" A must watch!!!","My Wife's Murder is an extremely well made film. Directed by newcomer Jijy Philip (one of RGV's assistant), the film delves into the psyche of a murderer who kills his wife accidentally. The story revolves around Ravi Patwardhan (Anil Kapoor) who is a middle class film editor. He has a wife Sheela (Suchitra Krishnamurthy) and two kids. He spends most of his time working away in his studio with his assistant, Reena (Nandana Sen). However, the reality of his home is way different than it seems. His wife is a nag who is constantly bickering and suspecting her husband of having an affair with his assistant. One day, the spat turns ugly and Ravi loses his cool, pushing Sheela which results in her hitting her head on a wooden carving of the bed and dying instantly. Faced with an unapologetic situation, Ravi is hesitant about calling the cops as he fears he might get arrested. And this will ruin his children's lives. Eventually, he decides to play hide-and-seek with the law until the inevitable occurs. MWM is not a thrill-frill murder mystery. It' s a simply plain psychological film about a man who is unlucky on all fronts: be it personal or professional. The success of Philip as a director lies in the fact that how he managed to keep us glued to our seats despite a simple storytelling. He takes us into the mind of the troubled man and makes us feel his tensions, anxiety, excitement and helplessness. Under RGV'S tutelage, Philip has learned the ropes of direction pretty quickly and in most of the sequences you can catch glimpses of his mentor. The film has a dark look and it really helps build the tension and suspense. The background score is also apt for the setting. Cinematography by P.S. Vinod is first-rate. MWM totally belongs to Anil Kapoor. He sinks his teeth into the role of Ravi Patwardhan really well and delivers a fine performance. He is one of the underrated actors in Bollywood. MWM really helped him tap his potential as an actor to the fullest. Boman Irani is another actor who deserves an equal amount of applause. He is likable as the cop hot on trail of Anil's character in the film. He is made to act more with his facial expression than mouthing dialogues and he does it pretty well. Nandana Sen is passable as Reena. She gets more scope towards the second half though and she does it well. Suchitra Krishnamurthy, despite a 15 minute role, ends up giving an award worthy performance. Her role as the nagging wife stays with you even after you walked out of the theater.On the whole, MWM makes for an interesting watch. Go for it!"
