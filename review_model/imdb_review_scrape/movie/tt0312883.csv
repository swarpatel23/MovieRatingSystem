" Our youth needs it badly","A good quality film with a wonderful message for our youth. Everybody acted well. Songs-dresses-movements are cool. A must seen for all ages..." 
" empty goals","This film nicely depicts the false and empty goals a present day urban Indian teenager develops.Amisha was too good and her melancholy look helped her here as it did in GADAR.I would regard her as the tragedy queen of modern day cinema in making. My compliments to the makers of this film for raising an important issue concerning teenagers. It has become a fad/fashion in college students to go steady and have girlfriends.Those who do not get one sulk and go to the extent of committing suicide/murders,. This clearly affects the life and careers of such young men. I guess colleges should dedicate half and hour every week on counseling their students.They should be taught to control their emotions and concentrate on their real goal during this explosive age. I give it a 8 out of 10." 
" Better to forget the storyline and seek message within","A bollywood movie which seems little different from others.Well it have all the same contents that Indian movies have like plenty of songs,but still it manages to leave an impact on me,because it delivers a strong message 'Love is part of life not heart of life'!!! Though its not applicable for everyone around,but some of us may badly need it.That's what its been seen that most of guys(boys in many cases) just waste their time seeking around love forgetting all their responsibilities.To be more precise it seems to be happening in India and film is been successful to catch this problem....Overall,if you have time and don't hate songs then go for this movie........." 
" Not an ideal love story","Aftab Shivdasani's career in bollywood couldn't rise much due to his bad signing films, after the failure of most of his films except KASOOR KYA YEHI PYAAR HAI again had him play a loverboy though this time he is more intense(lover) as he keeps chasing the girl who doesn't respond to him, Like MUJHE KUCCH KEHNA HAI. Aftab hangs around with his friends and also chases Amisha who has a weirdo father who burns people alive if there go close to his daughter. Some characterizations are interesting but end up half baked, like Ashish Vidhyarthi's role, also Jackie-Aftab track The first half tries to establish the love romance and we have lot of songs(some are hummable), the second half gets serious and some scenes are well handled like Ashish Vidhyarthi insulting Jackie and Aftab's friends, But things get too melodramatic, also the scene when Aftab's friend paste posters to attract attention of Aftab of his brother's death look outdated, also the climax doesn't seem convincing though it has a good messageDirection KR Murli Mohan Rao reminds us of south potboilers,though he must be lauded for picking up a good concept which is different however he falters in handling Music by Sajid Wajid is saving grace, Meri Tarah is a superb song, Dil pe Chaane Laga, title song and others are goodAftab Shivdasani tries hard and is good at times but at many places he overacts, Amisha Patel irritates, Ashish Vidyarthi is good though tends to be loud, Jackie Shroff is likable in a cameo, Snehal Dabi, Sarafarz Khan and others are good as typical friends, Anupama Verma is good in an ill sketched role rest are okay"
