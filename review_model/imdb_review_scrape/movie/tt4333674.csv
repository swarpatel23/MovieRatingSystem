" Ponkshe ht Hunterrr all the way","Hunterrr is not all entire sex comedy start to end, in fact i would rate Hunterrr ahead of many of that genre like Kya supercool hain hum, Grand masti etc. Highlight of Hunterrr is the way the topic has been dealt and how we share it with others.Gulshan Devaiah as Mandar Ponkshe(Vasu) is fun to watch. Radhika and Sai are impeccable.Supporting star cast along with it make it brilliant. Watch out for characters like Mandar's two cousins.When i first saw the trailers i thought it would get banned. This has been the behavior of censor board these days but very happy that the content of Hunterrr got passed. Directed by Harshavardhan Kulkarni who is the real hero here ,Hunterrr will make a mark of its own with the youth as they will relate more to Hunterrr. Kudos to Phantom productions backing this project.Will go with 8/10" 
" a refreshing change from stereotype adult comedies...Absolutely awesome","Hunterrr : a refreshing change from other stereotype adult comedies. Direction was absolutely flawless with a non linear screenplay.The entire cast did a wonderful job with stunning performances from Gulshan Devaiah,Sai Tamhankar and Radhika Apte. A mind blowing and unconventional soundtrack with coming of age lyrics; and a very different and matured take on the subject of premarital sex and arranged marriages. One of the best comedies i've seen in recent times. In the end you will be left wanting for more though the runtime of the movie is a little more than expected. A perfect movie if you want to chill out and have a good time. 9/10 stars." 
" Probably an example to other bollywood movies","OK so this movie doesn't deserve an 8. But i'm still gonna give it that for a few reasons. This movie clearly looks like it was written for stage plays and mainly enacted by stage actors. This movie starts off as a cheap sex comedy and then adds surprising amount of emotional depth. What i don't understand if this movie with its low budget and no big named stars with a crass topic can do that, then why do these big budget movies suffer from being totally nonsensical from beginning to the end. Why do their emotional scenes feel like pure melodrama. There is a lot of good talent here and i wish they can get this cast to do a good movie with a strong story." 
" Simply Hilarious ride all d way !!!!!!!!!!","Hunter is genuinely refreshing stuff with crispy dialogue , awesome moments which are not only funny but will give u goose bumps for sure , the best part was obviously the childhood part where even a deadliest looking dare looked cute , although i did not no like the music at first but it was been made for the movie , it was used in the movie like punches. There is very limited skin show unlike other sex comedies ,practically no double meaning dialogue , to be honest the film is well above the standard of typical Bollywood sex comedies , hope it will start a new trend of different kind of sex comedies in Bollywood. Go for it guys !!! A cult is waiting for U !!!" 
" Radhika & Gulshan rock","This was the first movie which I saw Radhika Apte act, she has such a nice cosy voice, high sex appeal & looks to be the best actress of this generation with her high quality acting. He looks so real & girl next door. Gulshan just takes to acting like a duck taking to water. Gulshan is superb as Mandar the Vasu (womanizer), his unsure ways of approaching unknown girls & invariably coming up trumps was superbly portrayed. Hunterrr is a superb sex comedy minus the over the top double meanings & crappy acting like in Masti & Grand masti. Hunterrr rocks because it is so realistic & does not go overboard throughout. All the star cast did decent job but the lead pair were simply superb. The drawback of Hunterrr is it is not a seamless movie, there are so many flashbacks varying from few months to few years, this all could have well been avoided. In overall it is a highly recommended movie." 
" A Delicious Sex-Comedy with a Terrific Gulshan Devaiya!","Hashvardhan Kulkarni's 'Hunterrr' is raunchy, dirty yet irresistible. This one's A Delicious Sex-Comedy, that offers laugh & also emotional depth. Its daringly different & Gulshan Devaiya is simply terrific in the central role. 'Hunterrr' Synopsis: A sex addict recalls his lustful past before he plans to marry a women, who offers him love, rather than lust.'Hunterrr' works because the Writing is mostly strong. Kulkarni's Screenplay, which shifts back and forth, exploring the life of its extremely horny Protagonist, is enjoyable! The best bits come-up in the protagonist's past, be it his escapades with a feisty married women or with his college girlfriend. Yes, the romantic-track, which is the most prominent aspect of the story, also works, but at times, the humor falters. But overall, Kulkarni's Screenplay is unabashedly sleazy & some of the dialogue, are priceless! Kulkarni's Direction is pretty good. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is fine, although the film is a bit too lengthy (142-minutes). Some trimming was needed. Music by Khamosh Shah is in sync with the film's mood. Performance-Wise: Gulshan Devaiya is the life of 'Hunterr'. The talented actor enacts the sex-addict with remarkable conviction. He makes a perverted character relatable rather than repulsive, all thanks to his superlative portrayal. This is a knock-out performance, in every level. Radhika Apte is wonderful, yet again! What a performer! Sai Tamhankar is extra-ordinary & despite limited screen-time, she brings a fabulous color to her character. Others lend excellent support.On the whole, 'Hunterrr' is a joyride! Go, have fun!" 
" De-Tabooing Sex. â™¦ 60%","Indians are wary about sex. And there's a great chance that some of you readers may have problems with me including the three letter word in the summary. Well, the film is basically a sex comedy which opens the topic and makes its audience dive into everything that comes with it (no pun intended).It is the story of a man Mandar (Gulshan) seeking sexual liberation in a world (or country, shall I say?) where showing affection in public is forbidden. Since he reached puberty, Mandar has always been a curious lad who takes fancy in women and sex and masturbation. His flings switch ON and OFF as he seeks carnal knowledge every day like if it is a necessity like emptying one's bowels. He is just like an ordinary kid who wants to know things. But these escapades are not without its dangers as Mandar learns the hard way. The premise is brilliant and for Bollywood, a big step in the genre. It is in all ways superior to another film that comes to mind - Mastram (2014), a candid film about porn writing.The non-linear screenplay is fun; chronicling the protagonist's life from his childhood days when a naughty Mandar starts responding to his "other basic needs" to the days when he visits the video parlor shops to the college days when flings and scoring are all the rage. These sequences are shot beautifully with montages that streamline the story marvelously. It throws light about the perils of two distinct features: one, the danger of indulging in an extra-marital affair, and two, the complexities of pre-matrimony when dealing with an eventful past becomes a problem amongst the to-be-bride-groom. It amazes one to learn that the writers have sampled original references in their fiction which makes it look like it is a real deal. One can easily relate to the character if he's being true to himself. Let me clarify, the film doesn't break the taboo; instead it tries to permit and attach it to a normal life. Of course, adults are not very present in this mission, otherwise the case would've been different. Sex will always be a taboo in India, but it is out of the scope of this review.Although, there's a paradigm shift in the story when the joys of sex comedy turns into a drama about relationships. Maybe it was intended, but there is a chance that the audience, divided into two, may receive it rather critically. It will appeal the niche audience, the type that will be able to relate with the characters, but unfortunately even the drama may not entice the majority rest of the audience, for the screenplay doesn't offer what it may have promised. Nudity and actual sex are only suggestive and people expecting these may not be able to appreciate the psychology.Retro music and songs, great camera work, and amazing dialogs are the highlights of this comic venture that is not as sleazy as it advocates to be. Gulshan Devaiah is excellent and totally into the character. I can hardly see anybody else portraying this role so purely as he does. Supporters Radhika Apte and Sai Tamhankar are very good. In fact, the whole cast do a very good job. Because they are directed well, the film will never bore you. BOTTOM LINE: Hunterrr helps Bollywood transcend into a new level, and could even be called the pioneer of this genre which must be watched in order to be appreciated. 6/10 - Recommended!Can be watched with a typical family? NOSex: Medium | Vulgarity/Profanity: Strong | Smoking/Alcohol: Very Low" 
" A time pass sex comedy","Considering the low quality of sex comedies Bollywood churns out every year, Hunterrr is very refreshing to watch. Yes, it does objectify women but unlike the usual sex comedies, it is not stupid and low brow.Gulshan Deviah is Mandar Ponkshe, a middle class guy in his mid 30s. He is not your usual Casanova. He as the title suggests is a hunterr who waits patiently for the kill. He is not afraid to talk abt it to his friends and admits that he is a sex addict. His life finally changes when he meets Tripti played by Radhika Apte and now he wants to stop everything and marry her. But can he ?? As they say old habits die hard.What I liked the most about the film is its characters. Starting from Mandar to Tripti to his family and friends and even the women he has affairs with are real and believable. You feel you know these people when you see them on screen.The writing for most part is extremely good. There are some hilarious dialogues and scenes that stand out especially in the 1st half. The 1st half is a roller coaster ride as we seen a young Mandar slowly turning into Hunterrr.Its however the 2nd half that where the fun slowly disappears. We have certain sequences that don't add value to the film. Also, I felt the film is a bit long and should have been at least 15-20 mins short. Plus some of you might get lost when the story keeps travelling back and forth in time.But why I recommend one watch Hunterrr is because of Gulshan Devaiah. Devaiah is fabulous as Mandar. Mandar's character is someone whom he should be hating as he keeps on playing with women throughout the film. But we start sympathizing for him is becausse of Devaiah's performance. He is brilliant and plays the role of an 18-19 yr old as well as a mid 30 yr old with ease. Radhika Apte is superb as Tripti...a working women with a past and who is still in doubt about her future. The rest of the cast is perfect including Sai tamhankar who plays the naughty housewife.Hunterrr could have been a brilliant film. But the writers and Director miss the bus. But its still worth a visit." 
" A realistic life account of a sex maniac with an enjoyable first half and a confusing long second, ending on a routine note.","Clearing the doubts about the film's negative impact first, thankfully this is not any cheap, sleazy sex comedy as portrayed by its theatrical trailer, possibly designed with the only intention of grabbing some instant attention. Hence giving the project its deserving due, yes this is not any milestone kind of a film in this particular genre. But it still remains a mature take on the subject revolving around a character who has grown up thinking about sex alone instead of love and is now suffering due to the same in his later years heading towards the middle age.HUNTERRR begins on an interesting note with a series of flashbacks coming repeatedly in the narration and its first 30-40 minutes realistically depicting the age of adolescence in an entertaining comic manner setting a fine premise. It beautifully takes you back in the 80s in those times of 'Adult Video Parlours' running illegally, tickets being sold in black and cinema being the only entertainment for the people from all age groups. As the main protagonist grows up to be a college going boy, he teaches you a new word "Vaasugiri" and turns into a hunter of girls/women looking for some casual sex. The only erotic scene is served just before the interval and overall the film makes a decent impact on the viewer mainly due to its unexpected mature take quite different from the cunningly compiled trailer having a completely different vision of a B grade movie.Admitting the vulgarity, it does hurt you in a scene where the young boys are trying to touch the middle aged ladies in the market as their private game and the obscene suggestive gesture shown in its publicity poster. Yet as a whole, the honest biographical tone doesn't demean the women, who actually turn out to be an equal partner in the crime too representing their bold new-age avatar in its various sequences.However, as usual the light-hearted feels gives away to a tiring repetitive run in the film's second half. And we get to see a quite slow, confusing and too long narrative towards the end that ideally should have been summed up within a two hour format. The last hour sadly puts it back into the category of just a well-intentioned attempt that shies away from trying anything experimental in its climax that could have been its highlight as a pleasant shock. Probably (debutant) writer-director Harshavardhan Kulkarni got caught in the dilemma of how to end the film, that doesn't put it in the category of a too mature or an artistic take on the subject finding fewer takers. He surely had got the opportunity of making an off-beat gem moving ahead of all those cheap sex comedies making 100 crores, but couldn't maintain the pace and the entertaining factor continuing in its over-lengthy & monotonous second half as required. Having said that, I would still like to praise him for a fine effort made, not falling into the trap of using the sick tricks of the trade when it comes to such 'sex-based films'.Following the 25 years life span of its key character, HUNTERRR gets its much needed lift from the script and dialogues that do not depend upon any cuss words at all. So there are no 'Censor beeps' heard in the film surprisingly which certainly needs to be counted as a rare appreciable merit in the current scenario. The minimally used songs are just fine (composed by Khamosh Shah) making it as an interesting soundtrack particularly due to the numbers sung by Bappi Lahiri and Amit Trivedi (penned by Swanand Kirkire). Plus the background score certainly provides a great support to the film along with its art-direction & cinematography. But on the other hand, a better editing could have helped a lot since moving 'back and forth in time' starts irritating after a while, putting it frankly.In the performance section, HUNTERRR truly belongs to two people alone and they are Gulshan Deviah as Mandaar and Radhika Aapte as Tripti playing their respective roles brilliantly. Gulshan displays a fine sense of comic timing with an emotional sincerity too that doesn't let the viewer hate his 'negative' character of a 'sex- maniac' and Radhika delivers another lovable polished performance winning the hearts post BADLAPUR. So the film deserves to be seen for these two actors alone if not for anything else. In the supporting cast, Sai Tamhankar provides the erotica real-well, Veera Saxena makes a decent debut with a comfortable ease and Sagar Deshmukh truly does a noteworthy job in his few scenes coming after long gaps.In short, though the subject is disturbing focusing on just sex alone, yet the film deserves to be rated as a contributing step in our progressive Hindi cinema that doesn't bow down to the usual cheapness planned for some quick box office returns. Its not a milestone alright but has it visible merits and a mature take on the subject too with some outstanding realistic performances forcing you to admit the harsh truths of our questionable real lives shamelessly. Anyway, ending on a different note, HUNTERRR made me recall one of my favourites Hindi cult classics that also revolves around the different phases in a man's life and his loving relationships with three different women teaching him the meaning of love. The film was showman Raj Kapoor's most beloved child MERA NAAM JOKER released in 1970.But perhaps due to the changing times & mindsets, where MERA NAAM JOKER focused merely on heartfelt emotions, love and trust, HUNTERRR solely emphasis on sex and one night stands alone representing the inevitable change around us in the 21st century. So forgetting its misguiding trailer, do give it a try as a mature adult comedy rising much above the films we have earlier seen in this controversial genre." 
" Deceptively more than the sum of its parts","A (mostly) pleasant whiff of both nostalgia, esp. when it comes to how the movie deals with the coming-of-age portion of the plot, as well as the refreshingly mature (and this is subjective for sure, but definitely tasteful) treatment of sex-outta-wedlock has been treated, especially when the same has to be gleaned within an (extreme / extremist?) conservative milieu like ours, which has always been defensive at best, but typically almost always in denial, about such 'trysts', and hopefully will subtly alter its attitude gradually at least, given there are film-makers out there like Kulkarni and his ilk, with refreshingly progressive attitudes that shine a light on the same with works-of-art such as these.Before I delve further into the so-called 'heavier' aspects of the not-really-straightforward plot, I do feel the need to digress (a bit). One of the things that struck me was how this one, along with Udaan, Lootera, Aankhon dekhi and Dumb lagake haisha, seemingly re-created period milieus, without drawing our attention to the effort that must have taken. The cinematography and the simple prod and art design kinda make it seem effortless in all the flicks, without calling attention to themselves except in retrospect, like I'm doing so now.Loved the background score, and enjoyed 1 song that played in the background (as well as end-credits). While the BG sounded very inventive, the best part for me was that it did not sound as clichÃ©d as most other (mainstream?) works in Hindi cinema sound. While not as inventive as Aankhon dekhi was, this is a very strong second, and I do wish they put the BG score out there for purchase. I will be watching out for other movies from Harshavardhan Kulkarni, and am a firm fan of his technique (with a few exceptions, that I will skim by in a bit).Now, for that 'heavier' stuff I referenced at the beginning: If my initial description makes you think this is heavy going, you'd only be partially right, since the movie does take a detour towards heavy- duty drama with a couple of events addressed during the runtime of this flick, but then takes a hard left back again to where we were at from each of those detours. I confess I did not expect this movie to make those substantial detours, and while I did try and predict what might become of those segues, nothing I imagined came to fruition, which was both a blessing (since I was surprised) and a disappointment (the movie might have benefited substantially if 1/more of those threads were closed fittingly). Anyways....I've only watched Gulshan Devaiah's performance in one other flick - Shaitan. It was loud and obnoxious, as befitting the character he played, which was showy at best, but a perfect showcase for a new actor, and his effort did show. However, from a performance perspective, I went in looking forward more to watching Radhika Apte (Shor in the city, and the recent Badlapur) perform, especially since her portions in the trailers for this one promised a lot. What did I get on that front? An amazingly grounded, mature performance from Devaiah, in spite of the challenges he faced, especially since his character is not one to empathize with, at least not in public (snigger!). Grounded, mature, and very, very good. Zero over-acting, or playing to the gallery (I was worried about that for sure, considering 'Shaitan'). Apte, ended up having more screen-time than I credited her character with in this flick, and that made for a pleasant surprise, in spite of certain clichÃ©d decisions made about her character (true-to-life, one might argue, and I might lose that argument, to be fair). One of the best revelations though, was the Maharashtrian/Marathi-movie (Duniyadari) actress, Sai Tamhankar, who had an unenviable job, playing a character who could turn out to be even less easy to empathize/sympathize with, with a dignity that few actresses might be able to muster. I'm sure I'll be in a minority on this one, but she brought a class and a dignity to her role, that's worth being the sole reason to re-visit this flick.Kulkarni, though deft in most sequences, sometimes seemed to falter in 2 areas. 1, in keeping the timelines straight. While he did prove adept when it came to keeping then period aspects straight, most of the audience-members, me excluded, were continuously complaining about the frequent time-jumps, especially when those jumps pertained to recent events in the movie's timeline/s. While I, perhaps in a minority, enjoyed that as I am wont to, it also comes with having viewed many other movies that played with timelines similarly. Here, it did act in alienating a significant portion of the audience. However, if it brings them back to re-visit the flick, that might just be Kulkarni's win. Jury's out, however, and time will tell. 2, in his handling of faux-flashbacks. I did feel that the device was over-used, akin to the sim(ulation) sequences in the Divergent series (more on that elsewhere).All in all, a movie that deserves an audience, and hopefully one of the better examples of progressive-minded cinema in a milieu that might learn to appreciate it, given time and lesser interference from the moral police (who, unfortunately albeit typically, have their grubby hands all over the flick, that can be glaringly and painfully obvious to those who're watching closely, and who can read the list of stuff excised from the final product). Sigh." 
" I will take this over any and every "Family Proof", "Safe Comedy" or "No-Brainer" movie out their.","A lot of core things it said are true and are in no way a wrong depection of any thing.
Some things might be a bit not "Family Proof".. but that dosent mean its a bad movie.Once stuff like these happen to you or people around you...
you might be able to relate to them i guess....Anyway acting was awsome.
direction was awsome .
Story awsome.
all in all i will give 4.3/5" 
" Urban adult comedy","A coming of age story about a guy and his three cousins. The guy is a playboy. A comedy set in urban India. The set piece gags are hilarious. The dialogues are great. A real adult comedy which is rare in Indian cinema. The acting is great and the subtle nuances of the characters are shown beautifully.The film is a bit long and could have done with some editing. The sad part is such films don't get a wide release and are only discovered on the streaming platforms. Would like to see more from the writer director." 
" Gulshan is a guy to watch out for","Bollywood is really bad at certain genres. Sex comedy is one of them. More often than not, Bollywood goes for the vulgar for the sex bit and for the comedy, it goes for the cheap. So we normally have bad actors and skimpily clad bimbettes, mouthing dialogues replete with innuendos in a chaotic confusion that claims to be a plot. Hunterrr is a pleasant deviation from this boilerplate. The acting is brilliant. Gulshan shines as the "vasu" player. Sai plays the sensuous housewife next door albeit in a restrained manner without going over the top. Radhika is great as the blase love interest. All the characters in the movie are believable and have their own story line. The movie is funny and endearing and extremely relatable, unlike the usual fare." 
" Great comedy drama with a beautiful natural cinematography","People label this movie as a sex comedy, its not. It is a great coming of age drama rather. The way of doing it happens to be sex in this movie, hence this film is not at all about sex.Its about the little intricacies in how a young Indian guy perceives the fairer sex, overcomes the fear of approach and once in it, enjoys the 'game' even more so than the sex itself i might say. Sex is just a reward. The guy's a 'hunter' and hunting is fun. Hunterrr manages to show that without being misogynistic or demeaning women which is a hard feat to pull off. The women are not shown as weak prey and Mandar isn't your typical alpha male but he is 'vasu'.Natural reactions off all women in this movie albeit not all 'heroine' kind when approached by a 'vasu' is what we should take a note on as Indian guys. He has charisma, he is an average guy like most of us, he is quirky and maybe a bit intelligent with conversations. Doesn't push hard, doesn't make them look stupid to display his macho-ism. Just good old balls and a smile. The movie makes us engaged throughout, its like watching a character whom I know for ages by going back and forth in time from his childhood to adulthood.The movie stays honest. Never justifies his act. The women move on from his stints and his cousin constantly reminds him what kind of person he is and what his destiny really is. But the hunter gets hunted. Falls for Radhika who is yet another treat to watch in this movie. Another great aspect of this movie is the solid all natural locations of dorms, hostels, rooms and homes atypical of the average Indian class and a touch of the 90s.Different movies likes these which dares to touch upon subjects like promiscuity and sexual liberty and passes with flying colors are a treat to watch." 
" The raunchy adventures of Hunterrr...","Hunterrr is a fine sex-comedy boosted by great performances and dialogues. It is way above the league of typical Bollywood films in the genre such as Grand Masti or Kya Super Kool Hai Hum. The writing is quite strong and has good balance explicit jokes and relationship drama. Gulshan Devaiah plays Mandar Ponkshe aka The Hunterrr or 'Vaasu' as he calls himself, meaning a person who cant control sex and does it whenever possible without thinking about the consequences. We follow his adventures from his puberty to his current relationship which is quite a mess. There is a lot of back and forth switching of timeline in the screenplay which I feel was effectively done. We see his relation with 3 women played elegantly by Veera Saxena, Sai Tamhankar and Radhika Apte. The actor playing the young hunterrr has also done fine job and the whole childhood memory part I liked the most in the film. The acting is first rate plus the retro music and songs are thrillingly enjoyable. Still, the pacing is a bit slow and the run-time of 140 minutes felt a bit too long. It loses grip in second half after a strong first half. The entire run-time is not a sleazy wild ride, there is sentimentality and romance mixed up with an interesting yet predictable climax. In the end, Hunterr is good enough for some laughs and to relish the excellent performance of Gulshan Devaiah who does great justice to character of Hunterr making us like him despite his deeds. I think Hunterrr is a cult hit!RATING: [3/5]" 
" Just a beginner not a hunter","Main problem of this film is bad characterization. For example title Hunter is too harsh for main lead. Actually he is novice, vulnerable and confused, which are basic minus points of a hunter. He should have been at least over smart. The publicity designer work is superb. They create more curiosity than any other thing of this film. There is just an idea in the name of story. Dialogues by Director, Writer, Mr. Harshvarshan Kulkarni are good at places. Few scenes are innovative, cute and funny, like head shaved boys in school, When main lead meets with girl's parents in shopping mall. Other major drawback is the narration style, they always take the film in flashback and mention the time lapse by supers, so I get confused so many times to connect them, this type of narrating style is good for thriller but stains the mood in comedy genre. Taking advantage of dreams in flashback is many times, it tickles first but then irritates. Promo was promising that this is almost in sex comedy genre but there is no sizzling dialogues or scenes. There were scope but deliberately they preferred to keep it undertone. They could have easily gone for U/A certificate but why did they settle for A, I am quite unable to understand. Movie is slow most of the places. Scenes also give jerky feel. Length should have been less for sure. Emotional note in climax gives some sweet taste at last. Performance wise Gulshan Devaiah as Mandar is fine. Radhika Apte as Tripti is fantastic. Her change of emotions, are very good, especially in the kitchen scene in pre climax. Sai Tamhankar as Jyotsna, is very good. One song "Don't reject me, I am a learner" is good."
