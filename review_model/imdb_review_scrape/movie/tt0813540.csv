" The Indian Indiana Jones?","No way is it near the levels of the Indiana Jones trilogy. 'Naksha' does take its source from numerous Hollywood films, including 'Indiana Jones'. That doesn't really work in favour of the film. Yes, there are a few good moments (stress on the word few). I think this movie had potential to be great (given the concept) and since adventurous films are scarce in Bollywood, 'Naksha' is sort of fresh. Now if only, the director had actually done a better job. The film moves at an uneven pace Technically the film is quite poor. Since it takes place in the jungle, a lot could have been done with the forest atmosphere and mystery to make the jungle more involved but its hardly put to use at all. The cinematography could have been a lot better. The split-screen was annoying and irrelevant and don't even get me started on the slow motion especially in the action scenes (which I fast forwarded). The action scenes were over the top and too long (which is expected in a film starring Sunny Deol). The special effects are of poor quality. Some of the songs are likable and of foot-tapping quality. I liked the chemistry between Deol and Oberoi. Vivek Oberoi does well for the most parts. However, in his introductory scene, Vivek comes across as whiny and Sunny is over the top in most scenes (as usual). Sameera Reddy tries to pull off a Preity Zinta and adds some glamour. She doesn't have much to do but she does beat up an item girl. Jackie Shroff is irritating. 'Naksha' is a wasted effort. It could have been great if the screenplay were tighter (and a whole lot modified). Editing would have helped. The writing could use a lot of improvement. For example, either leave out Sameera Reddy's character or develop the character and make her somewhat relevant. Involve the jungle. Tone down the fight sequences. Come up with something original." 
" Worst Movie of the year","I was very excited when I was going to see this movie but my excitement flied away just after seeing the first 15 minutes of the movie. This is the worst movie I'd seen in 2006. It is very bad remake of Hollywood movie 'The Rundown'. The story of second half of the movie is minor different but very very bad . Sunny Deol played the character of 'The Rock' of The Rundown. But his actions is too below than The Rock. Vivek 'oberoi' tried the character of Sean Willam Scott but couldn't do like 'Sean'. Special effects is of very low level. Somebody tell the Indian directors that Hollywood is too far & don't try to imitate them. In short sentence this film should be called "A piece of SH*T"." 
" A goof. Gets a F-","I think I should phone the director and ask him to re-release this movie and advertise it heavily as the funniest comedy of the year. I actually believe that it might catch more attention and gain revenue.It started downhill and kept going down from there until the last scene where I wanted to see some nice CGI, when Jackie wears the armor. But Sunny Deol - ah, and Vivek Oberoi, so gay that he would make my gay friend ashamed of his sexuality.And last, and pretty much the least, the director must commit suicide by hammering pins in his own brain.I should take film-making at college, and move to Mumbai. Actually, I just made up my mind...I will." 
" just a review","Yesterday i got the chance to view this movie. Name of the movie encouraged me a lot. I thought it would be a good adventure movie with some mystery involved. I i would like to appreciate the writer for thinking in a new way by concatenating adventure with mystery but he fails to write a realistic story and same happens in the direction part also. Through out the movie Director is not able to leave his mark. He would have covered the jungle and mountain in a different way by capturing some amazing location. we expect some good music from every Bollywod movie but here also Naksha fails completely. Through out the movie i was searching for the best part of the movie and sorry so say i couldn't found it. In coming future i would like to see some more Bollywod movies which try to think about some kind of good mixture of adventure and mystery with good direction.Thanks" 
" Not Bad but a good attempt","I had no intention of writing a review on this film but after reading the reviews written by others i was forced to do so. One of them said that the movie deals with trash mythology.Let me bring to the notice that the film has shown some amazing things about the Indian Heritage so you can take a hike. The movie is quite average and enjoyable.Few things in it is not acceptable like the scenes of Sunny Deol and Vivek Oberoi which was just copied from Welcome to the Jungle and also the action sequences like the jeep stunt, the shotgun sequence, and the fight with the dwarfs. It was just Cut and Paste. The story though was the same, but the actors had done quite well.Sameera Reddy was unnecessary. Jackie Shroff did a fairly good job and was acceptable. Hence, in all it was a film with too many songs, but enjoyable at the same time... Only a one time watch..." 
" Good, but could have been better","This is the latest movie to hit the screen and again I could not help but end up among the folks lining up to watch the preview. The trailers promised a good time and promotions hinged on this being a "different masala" kind of movie. This also marked the return of Sunny Deol after quite a hiatus.First the story Â– Two archaeologists, one good and one bad i.e. Bali (Jackie Shroff), are on a quest for a supernatural power. The good guy dies in order to avoid the map falling into the bad guy's hand. 20 years down the line the son of the good guy Vicky (Viveik Oberoi) inadvertently gets the map. Realizing that this was his father's dream he sets out to fulfill it. On the way, he gets into trouble as Jackie's men attack and kidnap him for the map. His elder step-brother Veer (Sunny Deol) comes to his rescue. Veer has come to take him back home and Vicky is in no mood to relent. Vicky manages to convince Veer that this was their father's dream and they ought to realize it. On the way, they realize that their father was not killed in an accident but by Bali who by now has managed to lay his hands on the map. Then starts a roller coaster ride to the destination and in the end the good triumphs over evil.This film boasts of a very interesting concept. Such films are rarely made in India (the last such movie that you can think of is the Mackenna's gold inspired Zalzala in the 80s). Just like you have seen/read concepts like Da Vinci Code/National Treasure which deal with mythology/history; the film successfully uses mythology (read Mahabharatha). But, interesting concept needs to be in efficient hands to make it into a good film. Such movies (maybe view might have been affected by watching similar kind of Hollywood movies) need to be going at breakneck speed, make your adrenaline pump; basically make you hooked onto the proceedings. This is where Naksha falters.Notable scenes in the movie are:***The clues are well thought out and filmed ***The chase through water is good ***The final climax and especially the way they ended was good. The director being a first timer could be a reason for this. Though some scenes have been handled well, Sachin Bajaj needs to improve on his story telling abilities. Editing doesn't help its cause either. Looks like the editor took leave or fell in love with the visuals. The first half really tests your patience. All the songs prove to be speed breakers and should be chopped off as songs don't have a place in such movies. Also, quite a number of scenes can be trimmed. Technically the film is far above the "run of the mill" movies. The camera-work is just splendid. The picturesque locations in New Zealand have been captured vividly. Action, by Allan Amin, is another area which has some fantastic work. Some of the action sequences have been directly "inspired" by the Rock movie "Welcome to the Jungle" as also quite a number of scenes. No harm in that as long as you do justice to that and Allan Amin does do justice. Background score by Salim-Suleiman is also very good. Music by Pritam is decent. The "U & I" number during the end titles stands out.On the acting front, Sunny Deol is likable as Veer. Given that his role is that of a strong guy, cant imagine others carrying it off convincingly. After a long time we see him in a non-patriotic/non-preachy kind of role and is a welcome change. He was his usual self in bashing up people, like only he can. His dancing was surprise though and looked like he thoroughly enjoyed himself in the "Jat Yamla" song, a far cry from his days of exercising in the name of dance (remember "Yaara O Yaara" from JeetJ).Viveik Anand Oberoi, that's what he calls himself now, might need to reevaluate his profession. The first 15-20 mins when he was showing himself as cool guy was irritating to say the least and the audience was praying for Sunny Deol to appear on screen (Actually the cheers were pretty loud when Sunny entered). Viveik was better off in the later parts but could have been better. No idea what happened to the promise he showed in his debut movie "Company".Sameera Reddy does not have anything to do and only once or twice mentions she was a journalist that's it. Just there for singing and dancing.Jackie is good as the villainous Bali and he does look sinister enough. A talented actor who nowadays does not do good enough movies shines here. Mridula Chandrashekhar marks her debut as a moll and is utterly wooden. She does nothing noteworthy except bare her body which she does effectively. Others like Suhashini Mulay, Navni Parihar, Lilliput are all wasted in inconsequential roles.Overall Naksha has an interesting, different plot and has its moments but makes you wonder how good it would have been with a competent director and and some editor" 
" could have been a good movie","First of all, let me say that good or bad it is different than our normal Bollywood stories. It certainly sets the 'may be coming new era' of adventure and fiction Bollywood movies. But the movie is a miserable failure at most of the points. Lets start with music. Not a single song, you will like to remember when you are out of theater. Action which must be an important part in such movies, looks like directly taken from Hollywood movies. But again, as with the current Bollywood movies, nothing looks real. Audience can easily guess that this scene you have done with strings attached to the actors body. Moreover, when you show some over action, like two guys destroying the whole camp, you will need some extra stunts, to make it believable. But it fails to make an impression. In the area of acting, only Sunny and Jackie has done some good job. These experience actors are good with their limited talents. Vivek still has to do a lot and Sameera (who I don't know why has any role in this movie) in fact was almost negligible. You watch her because she is occupying screen. Coming to story, it was good except that as any other Bollywood movie there are lot of loop holes. Though it was nicely joined with Mahabharat, it seems that writer do not have deep knowledge. Just a little bit more on Kavach part, could have done better. On direction, looks like a lot efforts have been taken on special efforts. And seems that because of this other areas remain unimproved. Some scenes like river crafting, and fight with dwarfs could have made better and realistic with just a bit more efforts. But seems like director was confident on visual effects and story line and thinks these things as secondary. At the end, it just makes an impression of a new software which fails due to major bugs." 
" Better Than I Expected","Initially I had absolutely no hope for this movie, but I decided to watch it anyway. Surprisingly it wasn't too bad. It actually managed to catch my interest, especially the whole puzzle aspect of it. The integrated mythology was the best part of it. It could have been a great movie if they concentrated more on the different elements of the map - such as why each was included. It starts off slow but picks up in the 2nd half. Vivek Oberoi tends to get a little annoying. Jackie Shroff was perhaps the only actor in the whole thing that was sufficient. Sameera Reddy's role is completely unnecessary. Effects aren't bad, and landscape shots are well done. All in all, its good if you have time to spare." 
" Horrible movie that copies many Hollywood films. Who needs a Superhero (Krrish) when you have Sunny Deol.","This Boring Bollywood movie has copied many Hollywood Films with the basic storyline of National Treasure (Son, following his fathers footsteps in seeking a treasure). Welcome to the jungle (The Rundown) and Jackie Chan's Armour of god.This movie has a lame plot that is so ridiculous, no wonder it was an instant Flop in the UK. They try to mix mythological trash with modern adventure and the outcome is a disaster.Some critics in India are saying that this film has good action. When a single man (Sunny Deol) is standing on top of a car and alone is shooting about 30 guys is NOT called Good action, but dumb action and the worst is the ending when Jackie wears the magic armour and our hero is still taking on him. Like i said above, Why bother making a superhero movie in Bollywood (Krrish) when you have Sunny Deol fighting like superman, I guess some directors of Bollywood won't learn. Vivek Oberoi is annoying and i feel like slapping him. Sameera is a time pass added in this movie. Jackie Shroff is alright, but the treasure that the people are looking for is a armour. Jackie wears this armour, but still Sunny is a match for him???????? I don't get it, Viveks father died for this." 
" Amazing!!","Naksha is definitely one of Sunny Deol's best action movies ever. The plot is novel, path-breaking, and new to Bollywood. This a total action adventure with thrills and fun. Watch this movie, and you will be in for the roller coaster ride of a lifetime! The movie is awesome and fun, and finally does something different from the norm. After seeing Sunny Deol in full form, I will say how badly I missed him in heavy action for a long time. The action is one of the best ever in any action film (unlike the previous venture, Teesri Aankh (I felt bad for the way that was done)). Now Sunny should just go nonstop no matter what!! Just ignore the stupid media and critics and just watch the movie. Do NOT miss this movie for anything else! This film deserved to be a blockbuster, as it was something new and different and cool. Just watch this action-adventure and enjoy man!! Recommended for Hindi action movie buffs. I loved Sunny's fight with the 6 Thai fighters and later, the shootout at the baddies' camp with the jeeps blowing in the pre-climax. I would give this one 12/10! Enjoy!!" 
" A waste of a film that can be avoided","Hi, In case you are sitting awfully idle and don't know what to do with your time then this movie fits in your schedule. Rent a VCD and see it and don't waste your money going to the theatres.The plot tries to work on Indian mythology but the movie is so loosely scripted and even so badly executed that you wonder why did the makers even make it. The actors are totally wasted and loose they simple did it for money and they are not getting any worthwhile project to do (which is actually true for all the starts of this film).Creditible is the fact that they tried to make an adventure film that have totally died out in Bollywood.See it..close it..forget it.. (if u want to watch it)" 
" Laughable","Another pathetic movie from Sunny and Vivek The movie copies from several films and comes as a terrible masala messThe first half is nothing great till Vivek decides to find out the truth but Sunny's intro is like a 80's Dharam filmThe rest comedy scenes fail to make you laugh Even the entire Jackie angle fails to convince and the last half n hour is the worst part It's hilariousDirection is bland Music is okaySunny Deol looks aged and wrinkled and does an okay job except when he goes loud Viveik overacts in comedy and is decent otherwise Sameera Reddy is a waste Jackie Shroff is convincing"
