" Brilliant!!","Through the last 5 years, KITES has been slammed for lots of reason,which are baseless to me, because once you see the film, you will love it..A story of love, tragedy, excitement, sorrow, it had all.. Why still people can't get it, is not understandable.Okay I am not blaming them, to me a film which have good story, good acting and x-factor are good film. KITES had it all. It is simply awesome.I will not mention the story here,as either you all know it, or you are not interested. Hrithik was superb. Strong performance from him. Barbara was equally impressive. Rest casts did justice to their role. Good location and good music.A must-watch." 
" Tranquily Frenetic?","Boy; after so many disheartening feedbacks from my friends; I actually enjoyed the movie. Hrithik; truly is the most charismatic actor of India. Barbara Mori's acting; her expressions; her smiles all are fabulous. She was great in the movie. I like the background scores and songs are also good. The best segment of the movie was about the dilemma of the protagonists and their snapping out of it. How two people could be entwined; purely due to feelings; traversing region, language; be it their destiny; is beautifully portrayed. Although; I didn't like the ending, but it is believable; as it is not necessary that things ought to end happily. Also, Hrithik's dance, at the movie's preamble is great; as all of us are aware of this talent of his. Surely, the movie doesn't tell a completely unique or 'not seen/heard before' kind of love story; but the direction, great acting and the composing elements like scenes, landscapes, cinematography and music does make it worth watching for a great experience, when you are completely free and in a blue/romantic mood. Great Movie; 10/10." 
" Kites, fantastic","It's a Hollywood bollywood combo, but great! Main Indian audience won't like it because 90% is English and Spanish. Hrithik was SuperB in the movie and Barbara 2. It's a movie that wont gain great box-office achievement in India, but will be appreciated by many Hollywood critics. Rakesh Roshan was great as a producer and Anurag is one of the best in Bollywood. Thumbs up to them! Also, the screenplay is wonderful... Never seen such a screenplay in a Bollywoodmovie besides Black. Kites is one of a cult movie among movies as Black, MariGold etc. Just go and watch! If you don't want a ordinary Bollywood movie. It's pasta not biryani." 
" That is called being impetuous","I like the movie. It ain't bad like others describe. Ever tried watching Babel. You know there are times when we've gotta be impetuous and need to have some adrenaline rush. It feels good. There are some guys who only want some family sentiment, some monkey dance, and happy ending. They are hypocrites. They wanna live far from reality. Somebody said that Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the number of moments that take our breath away. This movie follows this rhythm. Sometimes everything is not happy and despair does teach us guide us in a new path.The performances are good and the chemistry is good. Hrithik should have bettered himself in some scenes like at the bar & making jokes while robbing a bank. There are some goofs though. Barbara is gorgeous and performance is good. Anurag has done good job. But, the only fault is that they should n't have released in India. Like I said, they want some monkey dances and some nonsensical goof romancing with a stupid chick and some opposition from parents and happy ending. It takes few more ages to let them grow out of it.Overall, It has some adrenaline rush,romance & good ending.I would give 8/10 as its made by an Indian trying to catch up with the world cinema or more simply real cinema." 
" One Step ahead from Indian Movie","I've watched hundreds of Indian Movies, honestly most of them too disappointing when it comes to action and visual effect, Kites bring new breeze, the plot maybe usual and classic ( people who fell in love would do anything ) but since this is an Indian version the story is quite melancholy but not excessive i'm enjoying this movie very much, to describe the movie in one word so kites is "beautiful" If you are a huge fan of some nut thrilling/action movie like Saw,Rambo,Texas chainsaw and so many kind of them then you should go far away from this movie, but if you love something like romantic but combined with action then this movie is a good choice for your weekend entertainment" 
" This is GOLD, only watch the INTERNATIONAL English Version","I am not into dumb Musical movies, especially Bollywood ones and when I got the Chance for Special screening of Kites, I simply turned down. But I decided to give a try for it's International Version crafted by the XMEN 3 LAST STAND director Brett Ratner.I expected a mediocre typical Bollywood Stupid Musical Dance movie, but this one broke the mold. This movie will be remembered as the Trendsetter of Hindi films in the International Grounds.It is a Rollar Coaster film, but with a Heart. I don't want to spoil all the story but it reminds me some of the movies like Stallone/Sharon Stone's Specialist, Mr & Mrs Smith, Bonnie & Clyde, even a Hindi film Daud, but all those stands down in-front of Kites.I don't know how the Hindi version would look like, how the conservative audience react to Kites. With some Intense Physical scenes and unique narration which really required for the story material, I think this movie is going to be a "Love It or Hate It" category.The thing I don't like in this movie is the Love story itself, because it's too aimed for Female "Twilight" Audience who worships Romance. Other than that it's a Total Adrenaline movie, with great cast and good locations. The main leading man Hrithik Roshan I think is a well trained actor, with great physique and fight/dance abilities. This could be his "Enter The Dragon" in Hollywood.Also I have to give credit for Brett Ratner for his experimental Remixed version for the Movie. With no Reshoots, just with the Original and unused material he made the perfect Crossover Product for an Asian film. By hiring composer Graeme Revell the movie got a new dimension and a fresh soul. The action scores and emotional themes heard in the movie were so brilliant, it definitely going to be Graeme Revell's best work after Daredevil and Freddy vs. Jason.My recommendation only watch the International Cut. It's more cooler, edgy and Real. It is much shorter than the Asian version I heard and much stylish. Also it got no Dumb Song dance numbers (except the last one, which was done brilliantly by lead actor Hrithik Roshan).Anyway I give this movie 9 out of 10.Kites = The Next Level" 
" dancer who marries woman for money, so they can get green card, falls in love with a woman who he cannot have","I have watched a movie with Hrithik Roshan not some long time ago, and he is a brilliant actor and dancer.n this movie, 2 people fell in love, and although they were both in seek for money, they realize love is more important than everything else and the fight for each other.Acting of both lead is so amazing, u can feel their emotion..he speaks Indian and English ,and she speaks Spanish, so thay cannot understand each other perfectly, but there is a language of love.This movie is worth watching every minute, u will be amazed by beautiful cinematography and beautiful story, not like other Indian movies..beautiful, beautiful movie..." 
" Awesome....","Kites is a far better movie than most of the movies made at present. It may not have gained commercially but it did gimme a joy that such movies are being made.The acting was good. Barbara is cute can't blame people who thought she couldn't act because we are fed on diet of melodrama.Felt bad for the distributor's who couldn't make money.The exhibitors may have felt the heat but I belong to a minority that loves cinema as an art more than business.Kites had good cinematography,the screenplay was good except the second last scene where Hrithik gets shot by Kangana.The songs were fine.As to whether the film had a concept well yes its the same romeo and Juliet story.So stop thinking about the concept.The only thing with the movie was that the audience couldn't empathize but i felt the same with revolutionary road too.So people we are in the transition phase of the Indian film industry....Enjoy the journey..We are heading towards a bright future!!!" 
" 'Kites'- style & substance packed in two hours","Hrithik Roshan's movies have gained the stature of uncommon events as of late. His last release came when I was in my second year and now I am nearing my graduation. All said, this guy doesn't disappoint a bit.Kites has a simple story with a fascinatingly beautiful soul. Two lovers and their strife for peace and bonding, when none understands the other's language. Kudos to Anurag Basu for keeping this movie away from bollywood clichés and giving it a truly international treatment, unlike some other filmmakers out there who produce so called 'crossover cinema' which turns out to be quite the converse. The length is crisp and though the second half could've been better, the amazing chemistry between Hrithik and Barbara keeps you riveted till the very end.In performances, Hrithik is quite the maverick at his cool conman turned lover act. Effortlessly oozing charisma, he has indeed kept upto his fans' expectations. Barbara is a delight. Unlike other foreign models who come to India for the skin show and currently rule the roost so as to say, she is beautiful yet articulate throughout the movie. The supporting cast is able.Technically, this has to be one of the best movies I have seen. Rakesh Roshan as always has left no stone unturned to give kites an international look. The cinematography is awesome with quite a lot of camera work a-la Guy Ritchie genre movies. The background score is soothing like a gush of cool breeze, and especially the end is very well done. I might get a chance to catch the international version as well, and if I do, no probs with watching Kites again!" 
" An excellent well made movie","Kites indeed is a cinematic cocktail as earlier said in the review!! I have never been a fan of Hrithik Roshan but watching premier of it in NYC makes me surely one. Had it not been for my girl friend, I would have surely missed such a well made movie. It was an enthralling experience and acting of Hrithik Roshan is just way too brilliant!! It is the best bollywood movie I have ever seen in recent times. Barbara is Sizzling and very hot!!. We were on edge of the sits in last 25 min and there is a lot of X factor in this movie. Hrithik's dance was mind blasting and I never have seen such perfect acting, great choreography and superb on screen chemistry in a long long time 10 Cheers to Kites!!" 
" Absolytely Fantastic! Jai Ho...","For the first time I watched an "Indian" perform to the Hollywood standards, yet keeping its Indian viewers happy...It was like a 'gel' between a 3hr Hindi action flick and an 'good' Hollywood movie...Others have tried, 3 Idiots, Monsoon Wedding and many more, but this flick truly made it in my opinion...Barbara Mori, complimented Roshan's performance, and well it was Great Chemistry and just an enough dose of everything a action/love story flick has...Hats off to everyone who made this happen... it was really time well spent after the last movie i watched "House Full", which should have been named "House Full Of S h i t" ...Will look forward to Anurag Basu's next flick... it takes guts to stray off the normal commercial flick's and well, this is one viewer saying, it paid off buddy...Fantastic!" 
" Pathetically Disappointing ....!","First things first, you would have heard the phrase: 'Only Style, No Substance'.. Kites changes that phrase into 'Only Hrithik, Nothing Else'.. Touted as the stylish bollywood film ever with loads of drama, action and thriller.. But it had NOTHING except a few scenes which do bring smile on faces but were not strong enough for people to say cheers for the movie.. Even Dhoom:2 was bad but Hrithik carried it off well on his own, but Kites is worse and this time even Hrithik's enigmatic charisma can't do any good to this film.. Starting from story, screenplay and acting everything was poor.. Anurag Basu who previously directed Gangster and Life in a Metro gave his worst this time.. Hrithik initially was not up to the mark but then as the film paced he got better and better but like i said his heroics can't save the film this time.. Barbara Mori was good but not best like everyone said.. The bad man Nicholas Brown was at par with Barbara..The extremely talented Kangana Ranaut was wasted! Even Kabir Bedi didn't get scope this time.. His role had to be creepier but he acted like a novice and was nowhere in the second half of the movie..Here goes the stupid plot:Dance Teacher Hrithik Roshan acts to be in love with Kangana Ranaut so he could use her wealth to live his life but his destiny turns his life upside down when he comes face to face with Kangana's Brother (Nicholas Brown)Tony's fiancée Barbara Mori. He realizes that Barbara is only marrying Tony for money just like him.. They both fell in love and the usual betrayal takes place in a typical bollywood style.. Kabir Modi who happens to be Kangana's Father and the owner of a prestigious Casino in Las Vegas who also is a Gangster does nothing and his Tony becomes mad after the ran-away couple that he just travels around the globe after them shooting around with his men.. The second half of the movie is so moronic that one wonders why is he still sitting in the theater watching this stupid movie.. The response if the audience was so bad that as soon as the exit door was open people started leaving their seats abusing the film badly.. No one even bothered to watch the last scene and the end credits! Hrithik does his stunts well in the song 'Fire'.. He is completely pokerface in the song and is busy in performing the dance stunts that he even forgets to bring a smile on his face.. He is totally expressionless in the song.. The music is above average is different from past movies of FilmKraft productions.. The only thing which is commendable in the movie is the cinematography..To conclude I would just say this is the WORST HRITHIK ROSHAN MOVIE till date.. Save your money and time and invest both in some other work.. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED.. And this time the Roshans are not going to have the last laugh.. They had said that this is a landmark film and will touch those heights which no other bollywood movie has ever had, but what the hell! In fact they should say sorry to all the people for creating such a big hype about the movie which is nothing but a below average mediocre bollywood masala..My Rating: 3/10; (I would have given 2 but being a huge Hrithik fan I felt pity and gave an extra point)Thanks & Regards" 
" A breath taking experience and ERA to begin.","HI,I felt lucky to watch the sneak peek of this magnum opus....and felt privileged after that....this movie goes from a truly touching love story to comedy(which isn't loud as other bollywood stuff) and then amazing thriller ending...!!This movie fulfills all the expectations brought by the heavy anticipation and aura created by its makers since it was announced. Hrithik-Barbara-Kangana-Kabir all are well fit in the roles and delivers their best till date. Flexy with Hrithik @ the end of the movie will make you think that this man is the Avatar of MJ in India...!All i can say @ the end is...."Kites" has it all,that a movie lover can expect from a movie...Feel the love and the creation of Anurag basu,one of the finest director in India now...a must go whether you like Hrithik or Bollywood or not." 
" Bollywood maturing","People who give a bad review to this movie don't know what they are talking about. If you are ready to accept an out of the box movie with a very well told story, don't miss this.This movie is not for the people who need to be explained every little detail like kids. Good action scenes with romance and a few instances of natural comedy. This movie shows that bollywood has matured and is a step in the right direction. Hrithik and the Spanish lady are excellent and have a very good chemistry.Rakesh Roshan's movies are always different but most of them fail, this doesn't. I would have given this a 10 if some escape scenes with cops would not have shown the cops to be totally outsmarted. That was the only flaw i found with the movie. If you like happy go lucky ending, then u may not like the last 10 mins. I don't have that problem so i liked it start to finish." 
" A beautiful Love story, must watch.","One of the finest film from bollywood which can touch the world audience, fall in love with it. Very happy & why i give 10 bcoz finally i can ask my frndz2 watch a Indian movie. All of my friend from here are not interested to watch a bollywood movie bcoz of few things, but now they will love it if they watch KITES. Some wonderful acting, great music, stunning dance by H, thriller, great cinematography and so on. I don't know why some people here are critical about this movie?? May be their personal opinion but as a Indian i am very proud about this movie & this film will certainly open the door of world audience for the Indian cinema. I am not a fan of Huge fan of H but after seen this movie i am fall in love with him, he is really awesome, amazingly talented. I love Barbara also she is really hot like Salma Hayek. I really like this movie very much. I can say fall in love with it. Go watch it, complete entertainer. May be one of the biggest film of Indian cinema. I can assure you one thing if you are not HR fan or neither fan of Indian cinema go watch it, you will love it. Thank u so much Roshan Sir., Anurag & HR+BARBARA. My love for all of you. Big Hug........................................................." 
" Even Hrithik can not fly this Kite","This movie has set new benchmark for Indian cinema, even Ram Gopal Verma will have to work really hard to break it.Yes Hritik is handsome,charming, awesome dancer and has dominating presence on the screen, and of course Barbara Mori is sexy and seductive, but that is not enough, you need a screenplay to make a movie. The Movie simply has nothing to offer, other than its music.It could have been much better if at least one percent of the energy and time spend on the promotion would have been spend on making the movie.What a tragedy! Jindagi do pal ki, and i wasted two hours of it watching this movie."
