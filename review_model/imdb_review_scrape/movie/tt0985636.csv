" An unholy plethora of a woman who belongs to the holiest place in India","A look at a lush green fully grown tree might be a treat for one's eye but even it's root might have ended up in some drain of a cosmopolitan city from where it sources its life.Well such is the story of this movie where in a simple small town girl falls in the webs of the flesh industry to get her family out of it's hysterical trouble. Now when such is the story of the movie less is left for the director and more for the actors to perform....and do they deliver???....YES they do, Rani Mukherjee does justice to this difficult role that she has performed, specially during the transformation from a village girl to the so called "high class escort". But Hats off to Jaya Bachchan & Konkona Sen Sharma who i should say is a jewel of bollywood. Its now that i realize how talented Mrs Bachchan is, a remarkable performance i should say. Abhiskek Bachchan is not Akshay Kumar but does his part in the movie to the audience's pleasure.On an all it is a well crafted movie, a movie on which effort has not been put only to sell it but otherwise.As far as the Rs 220 that i spent on watching this film is concerned, i think i got my money's worth. My suggestion is "please go and watch the film for the performances." 
" Daag Dhona Thoda Mushkil Hai","I'd been wanting to watch 'Laaga Chunari Mein Daag' for a while mainly because it starred one of my favorite actresses Konkona Sen Sharma and a used-to-be favorite Rani Mukerjee (I still like her). In spite of hearing the bad reviews, I was still considering it as I expected that in the least I'd get to see two great performances. That's all I got.Pradeep Sarkar could have made one fine movie but with so many unnecessary (and irritating) characters, the bad writing (clichès etc) and lack of character development the film is hugely bought down. Why the hell was there a need to have the whole Tinnu Anand - Sushant Singh track (they're irritating)? A wooden Abhishek adds nothing interesting (another track that could have better been left out). Anupam Kher hams it up as a card-board selfish (misogynist?) dad. Likewise the other characters are badly written. In the beginning we see a frantic Jaya Bachchan in the hospital when the husband's had a heart attack but Konkona's Chutki is shown to be very relaxed (as if nothing happened). Was she simply in denial or was she just staying positive? Then in a later scene (before Rani becomes an escort call girl) we see that her neighbor-friend offers her money for help but she still decides to sleep with his boss. Was it simply that phone call to her mother that pushed her off the edge? Jaya Bachchan plays a caricature mother and this can be added to one of her worst performances. In addition to all the mess, most of the songs were horrible and should have been edited out. The only songs that stand out are the first track, the song that takes place when Badki becomes Natassha and the Mujra (even though it was chopped and could have been better left as a whole). The outdoor locations (e.g. Switzerland and Italy) in the songs were unnecessary but what would a Yashraj film be without such flooze?On the positive side, as mentioned earlier, there are two standout performances. Apart from that one scene mentioned above, Konkona is brilliant. The role itself is not something particularly special, but the actress is and she definitely leaves a mark. The scenes with her and Rani are the best. Thankfully, there are enough of those to make the film somewhat worth the watch. It was funny seeing her do the singing and dancing (as it's the first time she's done that) not that she was bad or anything.'Laaga Chunari Mein Daag' is Rani's film. The actress does one of her best acts and shows tremendous growth. Easily one of the best performances this year and all Rani needs is more great (and such different) roles in great films to mark her talent.Hema Malini does a graceful cameo. However her dance-number is chopped into pieces. 'Would have liked to see her dance more. The cinematography is impressive, especially the shots of Banaras. On the whole, this is one severely flawed and very predictable film but with two fantastic performances that prevent me from calling it a waste of time. I'd recommend it to those who like the works of Rani and Konkona as long as they don't expect anything from the film itself." 
" Good Storyline, Realistic and Optimistic Cinema","When I went for the movie I was skeptical as I heard a review that the movie was a regressive tear jerker. Which thankfully was DEFINITELY NOT TRUE. I wonder if the reviewer actually saw the movie.The story is about a benaras based family falling into hard times and Rani moving to mumbai to save the family from financial ruin.A family falling into bad times is certainly not a novel concept. What is refreshing is the story line, which is definitely modern and realistic and never one dimensional. Life in Benaras and Mumbai has been captured beautifully without a trace of cliché.The romance between Konkona and Kunaal is refreshing and so is the chemistry between Rani and Abhishek. The story line is sometimes sad but always realistic and upbeat.Acting and Direction is superb. Rani and Konkona are superb. Rani sizzles with her looks and acting. Konkona acting is superb. Kunal has shown he is much more that a pretty face. Abhishek role is short but he does a decent job. Jaya's acting is flawless.Kudos to the director/producer for choosing a difficult subject and handling it with great sensitivity." 
" A Movie That Has To Be Seen At least Once","There was a song by a similar title, sung many years back by the legendary K.L. Saigal.Based on the old format about poverty, a movie production company hires a place in the Northern Indian city of Benares, where two sisters, Natasha and Chutki live with their parents. The father, Shivshankar Sahay, is against renting out his house to the movie company but has to accept it due to financial reasons. One night, upon request from one of the female members of the company, Natasha and Chutki go and watch a dance against their parents wishes. At the end of the performance, the three visit the female dancer, who tells Natasha that she is very pretty. But soon events turn for the worse and the movie production company, who had paid the family for the use of their house for filming, decide to withdraw and demand to have their money back. In the meantime, Natasha, who has had to leave college and help at home, has to admit her father to a hospital as he suffers heart problems and has to pay for him to be admitted. She decides to go to Mumbai and get a job as an actress as the female member of the movie had promised her. But nothing works out and in order to support her family, Natasha is forced to make up her mind as what she wants to do. But events force her to turn into a high class prostitute.This is one movie, that Rani Mukherjee, as Natasha, tries to show her versatility as an actress and has proved it. The other bit of excellent acting is by Jaya Bachchan as her mother and also Abhishek and Konkona Sen. But Hema Malini, who makes a special appearance as the dancer, is just magnificent even though she's in it as "special appearance." The movie also stars Tinu Anand as Shishankar Sahay's evil brother.Conclusion: This is worth watching at least once." 
" Underrated film, take time to see it for yourself.","I read the user comments before I saw this movie and I have to say after watching it I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is about a sister who turns to prostitution to support her family. Some users criticized how the main character ends up in prostitution and others criticized the outcome (skip this next line if you don't want to know the end of the movie-namely that her family and to-be-fiancée finds out and accepts her anyway). They said the movie was woman bashing. I did not find this to be the case. The film wasn't saying that all women end in prostitution if they have no job skills, it was merely saying that some women end up getting tricked into prostitution. That is true. I don't think its woman bashing to start with a real problem that happens with women. The outcome of her family shouldering responsibility and not putting all the shame on the main character is again not a sign of women bashing. It is merely implying that women who get involved into prostitution are not fully to blame. There are circumstances and events that end up pressuring women into these situations. Society needs to take their fair share of responsibility. It dealt with the issue of blame and shame. It did not deal with how to get women out of brothels, but not every movie needs to find a solution to a social problem for it to get a good rating. I think it had a good message that prostitution as an industry is degrading and harmful for women, but women are not solely to blame, those who had a hand in sending women into prostitution should also take there share of the shame. As for other parts of the movie, I find the acting to be good. Some of the songs were rather enjoyable, others could have been edited. All in all, it was good film with skilled actors, nice scenery, and a decent message. I think most viewers could enjoy this movie." 
" The Golden Triangle of Bollywood","What can I say except for the Golden Triangel of Bollywood has made the film a master-piece in superb acting.Jaya Bachan Rani Mukerjee Konkona SenWhat a golden Triangle, all of the have excellent skills in acting and the whole movie is carried on these girls shoulders, and they have done a really good job.Iam trying to understand why this movie was a flop in India, was it the critics or the public who didn't wanna see it ? Do the public only want Masala Movies with no meaning like Om SHanti Om (eventhough SRK is a brilliant actor). I don't wanna tell about the story but Laaga Chunari Mein Daag is a must see movie, and if you liked Saawaria and Om Shanti Om, I can guarantee that this movie has more dept to offer.One of this years best movies in Drama is :Laaga Chunari Mein Daag, And thriller : Bhool Bhulayaa" 
" Banaras, Bombay, and strong women characters","As anyone who has seen a trailer for this movie knows, Rani Mukherjee is a girl from a fine Banaras family on the economic downslide, who goes to Bombay intending to make money to help them out and finds herself in business as a high-class professional escort.When her younger sister, Konkona Sen Sharma, comes to Bombay to take up her own job in an ad agency, we see the two of them in a tonga on Marine Drive, the Queen's Necklace fulfilling its promise to swirl the city in glamor. When some ladies of the night pass by the carriage, Konkona makes an unthinking provincial girl's harsh comment, and her sister rebukes her sharply for her lack of compassion.In this passage of perfect dialogue, you have the main tension driving the story, and one of its many moments of good acting between well-drawn women characters. What is going to happen if the younger sister finds out what her big sister has done in order to secure her own future? Will Rani's sacrifice separate her forever from her sister's love and respect, and from a chance at acceptance in romance and marriage?I gather this is a Hindi movie theme known to the Indian audience. LCMD is far from perfect -- there's a mixing of story types going on probably, the old-style melodrama and something more modern and psychological -- but the good things about it make it more than worth seeing. There are four striking women characters (Jaya as mother, and Hema Malini in a special appearance that blesses the whole movie, including a dance that should have been much longer) who all seem relatively "real" in relation to Hindi movie women. They relate to each other in a decent, normal way (in small roles we have a less-nice girl and also a friend in Bombay as well).Another good thing: the parents are less than respect-worthy without being "bad" Hindi movie parents -- father clearly is an upper-class slacker who'd rather develop "symptoms" than get a job, rent out a room, sell the property and live within his means; and mother is interestingly ambivalent about what her daughter is doing in order to be sending home the cash.The cinematography of Banares and Bombay is worth the trip to the theaters, and the clothes are worth taking notes on, both the subtle and stunning cotton traditional clothes of the family in Banaras and Rani's high-style nicely top-of-the-city wardrobe. You might be reminded of India as the home of the most wonderful textiles on the planet.If the story is still Bollywoodized and Bollywood-y (how did a villain know the thing he knows? why don't we see a bit more of Rani's "work life"? why do we need a song that is actually set in Switzerland -- though maybe that's ironic/postmodern?), it nonetheless is a rich enough, fresh enough, and engaging enough experience, with great performances. As it really is about its women, the men are fine but you wouldn't focus on them in thinking about the movie. If you see the movie, you may find it raises good questions -- it it progressive? regressive? what do we mean by these things? -- worth talking and thinking about." 
" LCMD - yet another run-of-the-mill","This fall is supposed to be full of good and bad surprises. All the previews of this flick promised that a treat is likely to come our way. And this is exactly what has gone against this movie.The highlights of the songs weren't too misleading, as far as its catchy tunes are concerned. The plot revolves around a family settled in Benaras. Shivshanker Sahay (Anupam Kher) is a retired man lives in an ancestral house, with two daughters, and his wife, Sabitri (Jaya Bachchan). The elder daughter Vibha (Rani) is more conscious of her parents' old age, their growing anxiety for making both ends meet, and her incapacity as a woman to support her parents as a son would have done. This financial crisis pushes Vibha to fetch for work in a city of opportunities where opportunities are very hard to strike. From this point, the never-ending saga of Vibha turning into Natasha brings a very predictable twist in the story. Chutki (Konkana Sen) is one of the finest artists in Indian cinema. She has done full justice to her role as a younger daughter with little understanding of the family crisis and huge dreams for future. Though it is a very well-executed movie, with finesse of Pradeep Sarkar, and all the right ingredients for a commercial hit, it is a very predictable movie. The reason for its predictability is that the previews not only revealed the entire story, but stole all the surprising elements from it." 
" Predictable storyline but still manages to entertain","We have seen Bollywood churn out several good movies about the innocent small-town girl who is forced into a life of prostitution. One of my personal favorites, Julie, depicts this story very well. We get to see the same story once again in LCMD. I think the biggest strength of the film is Rani's great performance followed by the beautiful cinematography from the ghats of Banaras to the Mumbai skyline. Rani's performances are improving film by film, and one can now safely say that she is the top actress in Bollywood. Konkona Sen also does a good job. Hema Malini is a pleasant surprise. Jaya is a big disappointment after her lovely performances in Kal Ho Naa Ho, Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe, and Fiza. Anupam Kher was OK. Songs are decent. Being a Yash Raj production, I had extremely high expectations. I wasn't let down totally, but expected something more, something new. If nothing else, watching the movie is a nice way to begin the festive season in a year where very few good movies have come out. For those of you who don't understand Hindi, the English subtitles are quite a comical translation." 
" A must watch family drama!","This movie premiered on Oct 12, 2007. I was not too keen to watch another family drama but my friend Pratibha insisted that its not going to be a run-of-the-mill flick so I relented. I must say she was right and the movie worth the moolah! It begins with a song and dance routine featuring Shubhavari (Konkona Sen a.k.a Chutki) and Vibhavari (Rani Mukerji a.k.a Badki) on the river bank, meandering thru the by-lanes and leading to an old mansion in Benaras where we also get introduced to Anupam Kher (Shiv Shankar Sahay) and Jaya Bachchan (Sabitri) who are the leading ladies' parents. Everything's not hunky dory though-Kher's brother (played by Tinu Anand) and his son Ratan want to usurp the mansion and the family is distressed by occasional threats, quarrels and mounting litigation expenses. Anupam Kher is keeping poor health and Jaya Bachchan stitches clothes day in day out to supplement the family income.A film unit wants to hire the Kher mansion and pays them Rs.75000 but the windfall is momentary as the shoot is canceled. Distressed by her family's penury Vibha (Rani) lies to her folks about landing a job in Mumbai thanks to Sofia-the girl from the film unit. She lands in Mumbai and Sofia agrees to help her though her cold behavior suggests otherwise. Rani's lack of education sees her being chucked out from various jobs. Sofia's friend gives her some references but these don't work out either. Meanwhile Kher suffers a heart attack and Sofia's friend's boss spots Rani and agrees to help her. He asks Rani to spend the night with her-she is shocked but her family's condition makes her take the extreme step only to be told later that there was no job in the offing.Sofia asks Rani to leave and she goes and puts up at Michelle's place-the latter asks Rani to wield her power over men instead of being used by them. She helps Rani with her makeover and Rani becomes a top-notch escort and is soon flush with money-she sends money home regularly thereby helping her family to get rid of its poverty.During her flight to Zurich, Vibha meets Rohan (Abhishek B) and they share some light moments before she returns to Mumbai. Shortly before intermission Rani meets Ratan who threatens to spill the beans back home unless she pays him Rs.25000 every month. Rani agrees. She comes home to find her sister who has landed a job in Mumbai.Shubha (Konkona) meets and falls in love with Vivaan (Kunal Kapoor) who is Rohan's (AB's) younger sibling. Their marriage is fixed and shortly before flying to Benares Shubha finds out her elder's sister's dark secret. Initially she is shocked and annoyed but soon realizes that her sister did everything to support the family and she pursues Rani to accompany her back home.Alright fellas, you gotta watch the rest...lol! Rani Mukerji excels and so do the other members of the cast. A very good family drama with an undercurrent of a theme portraying the oldest profession in the world! Musical score is good too.Pssst...I almost burst out laughing when a girl sitting besides me started sobbing but I assure you this flick ain't a tearjerker...Sanjeev Logani :-)" 
" Great movie with very good performances","It's somewhat original and not conventional so it is lovable.a story whose time has come. India is changing. Our social values are changing. Before we could digest live in relationships (read Salaam Namstey) comes another surprise from Yash Raj, in the form of Laga Chunri mein daag. Those who think that it is too premature or somewhat vulgar should look around for clues and then they will believe it. So is this movie about today's woman? The answer is Yes and No. Yes to the extent it is related to her and No because it's not just about her being a woman but it is also the way she would react to changing circumstances. This movie is not for the masses yet don't label it as an art movie. A small town girl whose father is going through survival issues and family disputes is repenting that he hasn't produced a boy. Rani, who comes to Bombay, to help her father financially, falls in a trap of big city. But the money that goes back to her town makes her father feel proud about her and he discovers that even a girl can be a great support like a boy would be for the parents. The story goes through many ups and downs. Rani's cute little sister discovers about her profession, but she reacts in a positive manner. I would dare to say that it is somewhat different than our traditional bollywood ways. I think this is the USP of this movie. After that Abhishek comes in her life and proposes to marry her. But to see what happens next you need to see the movie. The bollywood hero has evolved with Abhishek's response to Rani. The Yash Raj banner has evolved after producing the movie. The sister and mother has evolved after this movie. The Bharatiya nari has tremendously evolved with this movie. Now you decide whether you want to evolve or not. Watch this movie to see the changing maturity of Indian Cinema." 
" Pretty decent one ....","I started out with a pretty bleak expectation, to be honest, but it was not all that bad after a 2+ hours.Though I was very impressed the ad-man Pradeep Sarkar's first outing, Parineeta. It was one of the best of that year. I began with expectations of good cinematography. But as the movie unfolded, it was hard to disregard the story to watch each and every frame! Certainly the frames, esp the Benaras ghat scenes were very artistically done. One can be pretty much sure of artistic delight of Pradeep Sarkar's penchant for visuals.Acting wise, it's Rani Mukherjee's solo movie. I don't remember seeing her in a pivotal role in any film. So much so that, her co-star Abhishek Bachchan almost seems a gust appearance in the movie. Kunal Kapoor does good job in his role. (Why does every working professional hero/heroine in the Hindi movies have to do a job in ad-industry?) Konkana SenSharma - the only character I thought was a miscast. A big fan of her, almost all her movies - but her role in this movie looks sorta fake! Its not matter of the middle-class-family daughter in Benaras or working professional (ad-industry, of course) in Bombay. For that matter, last year, Vishaal Bharadwaj shot her beautifully in Omkara! I just think she is not commercial-movie-type. She seems very fake, when trying to dance or sing.Shantanu Moitra's music is passable. 'Hum to aise hain bhaiyya' is hummable by the time you finish watching the movie, because it keeps playing in the movie throughout. This is a typical filmy album, with few happy, a dance number, a sad song, the usual fair. The only song really stands out is the sort of hip-hop number with Mita Vashisth's voice with Shubha Mudgal's rendition of Manna Dey's old classic, 'Laaga chunari mein daag'.Lastly, I am truly happy for Pradeep Sarkar. Here's a man, who came to the industry very late in his career, but I am glad he did. In fact, I think going to Switzerland for Yash Chopra's movies is a must, so he does! But really, he doesn't need to go abroad to make his visuals appealing, he has enough colors in his desi palette to fill the canvas!" 
" Flashes of brilliance are not enough to savour the disappointment!!!","Parineeta was among the best films to come out from bollywood in the past five years or so. Pradeep Sarkar had become a highly renowned name with that one subtle masterpiece alone. And when Yash Raj roped him in to direct 'Laaga Chunari Mein Daag', expectations were inevitable huge. And with the kind of star cast it boasted of, a quality offing was imminent. Alas, how you wish they had thought of making something worthwhile of their talents than this done and tested excuse of a story. I am not even bothering to write a synopsis as it would seem outdated even for a 70s audience. Each scene and sequence is ever-so-cruelly predictable. It does have its moments though. It is a beautifully presented film. The cinematography and the design and choreography are absolutely fascinating. The performances are top notch as well. Rani Mukerjee is excellent as you would expect, but she is betrayed by the film writer. Abishek Bachan and Kunal Kapoor have gone completely mental. How else could they have opted for such pathetically portrayed characters? Jaya Bachan shows her class but its Konkona Sen who shines. She comes as a whiff of fresh air in the otherwise dry and pointless enterprise. Sadly these glimpses of brilliance are not enough. Disappointing!" 
" Needs","This movie is very heart touching in daily life everyone needs for money today's not so much job needs to do things this type of job nice movie i love this" 
" Basic story, nicely produced",""Journey of a Woman" tells the story of a girl that moves to the big city in order to make money for her poor family at home. When she arrives, she has to learn the hard way that she'll have to stand up for herself. While she earns enourmous sums through prostitution, her new profession could set her sister's wedding at risk.The story is not very creative, just the basic story of an innocent girl moving to the big city and ending in sin. However, the film looks worthy, the acting is solid and all in all there's no reason for boredom. The singing is not my cup of tea but that's just a question of taste and I guess quite normal for most Bollywood films. What I undoubtedly appreciate is that the film takes a stand for those considered "sinful" and shows the double standards with which they are treated.All in all this is nothing special but it is a beautiful little film that's sure enjoyanble to watch and delivers some solid filmmaking." 
" The stained veil - usually deemed unusable","Aaina – remake – Laga Chunari Man Daag (LCMD) – release year 2007 30 years later, Bollywood made the same theme because they failed to drive in the message in the think-brains of we, the Indians – way back in 1977! So in LCMD- Rani (who eventually becomes a prostitute in the film) is the daughter of a retired Professor (Anupam Kher) who is not getting his pension and is shown running from pillar to post to get it. Jaya (playing Ran's mother) is somehow managing to run the household by sewing blouses & petticoats. Financial crunch drives Rani to the big city where she becomes a high class Prostitute – having the designation of 'Escort' because in big-big corporate sectors, the senior officials cannot ask like 'get me a prostitute for the night' ..etiquette does not allow – so a new name 'Escort' has been given to such sex-workers. They obviously get paid higher than the red light area sex-workers.yea – this is a kind of injustice – absolutely the same work but payment is vastly different! So in this world, in 2007, where unemployment is rampant, Rani starts living in a plush house in Mumbai plus starts sending money to not just feed the family but also renovate the dilapidated building they lived in! People from her village (her cousin in fact) comes to know that she was actually a sex-worker and even starts blackmailing her! She then meets a filthy rich handsome hunk who starts dating her and then even marries her because rich males – mostly f**k around all kinds of females – but in Rani – he could see the subservient, submissive qualities as well (along with promising sex-postures that escorts are supposedly experts at) – after all she was from a small town and decides to marry her after all. His brother marries Rani's younger sister – who was an MBA (not an escort because she was educated..I think this is the reason why Indian females are kept uneducated – coz if they all become literate and independent..who would do the job of sex-worker?..this is an inherent fear that sleazy debauch males have and thus do their level best to promote whoredom among women and keep it alive forever!) Take Home for commoners (thick brained esp.) after watching LCMD:That a female can be a sex-worker – either out of choice or by force – whatever – because eventually they will find some rich & handsome idiot to marry – so why not enjoy with as many males as possible?When males are allowed to happily hump around females – why shouldn't females do the same? Why on earth should they maintain their chastity or virginity – when some debauch, amply humped demon will ultimately marry them? A demon only deserves a witch. Ravana needs to marry Mandodari. So there.Some males seem hardly bothered about concepts like chastity or virginity (so it seems in the film) – the fact that Abhishek (Rani's hubby in the film) happily agreed to marry the escort – knowing very well that later, when he attends the corporate meetings etc., the BEEPS will smile and even wink at his wifereminding her of the 'nude' times they had together!!(you see Abishek happened to meet Rani in one of the corporate meetingsmeans that he will be meeting the same officers or executives – for whom Rani was presentlike to entertain them on bed!Aaina - a yesteryear Bollywood film Difference between Aaina 1977 and LCMD 2007 – Not much really. Parents are dumb enough to not understand the source of money. Both the times the prostitutes got married and lived happily ever after.Indians (maximum) went to see the conical blouse & open cleavage of Mumtaz and Rani respectively."
