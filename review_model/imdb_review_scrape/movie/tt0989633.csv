" Waste of Time Don't Dare to see it","A sense less movie, featuring the tensions between a married couple working two separate rival beverage company. Over all Story and the Acting of any character is nonsense. Jimmy Shergil's script is itself a comic delivery, So no need of a comedy actor at all. Neha Dhupia for no reason is selected as lead role for the movie, she has done nothing for what she is very famous. All songs but one are again even not fit to listen once. Tere Bin is retrofitted in the movie, just to attract audience. I really do not know, what actually is purpose of making such a poor film in every sense, just wasted money and time for it. Don't even dare to see it." 
" Nothing great to watch out for","This is the story of some people living in one apartment. As it progresses it comes out as one of those movies where every male character comes out as a bad guy and every female character is a poor victim of male dominated society. Just for a change the females which are wives are new generation thinkers and are out of the typical Indian woman image. But unfortunately the plot, the direction, the songs, the acting in short all the parts of the movies are very ordinary. The intentions of the movie is good. It tries to send out the message that in todays world, a man should try to understand the feeling of his wife and not to get in her way to accomplish her dreams. So the story of two couples are depicted in the movie, one played by Jimmy and Neha, the other by Ronit and Simon. Jimmy and Neha both are in corporate world, both are in marketing. In one situation Neha unknowingly takes out some contact from Jimmy and hurts his ego. In other couples Ronit for no reason likes to cheat on his wife, while Simon can't do anything about it. Some college kids also to be seen in the movie, along with some other old people. But I don't understand there overall role in the movie. In summary, this movie is not worth watching or spending money. Even though these actors are trying to do hard for their characters the characters themselves are vague and hollow. 3 out of 10." 
" Another new age cinema bites the dust","With the "new-age cinema" turning out to be a popular choice in the multiplexes and a safe bet for the producers we are having them in plenty.Delhii Heights (an overkill of numerology, IMO!) is compilation of a few tracks running parallel about the people living in an apartment.Jimmy Shegill Neha Dhupia track gets the biggest share of the cake. The hurdles and predicaments of corporate marriage (9/11 marriage) is showcased. Jimmy carries his role well, the only issue is his coloured hair. Neha is getting graceful towards the camera as each movie passes by. She is gorgeous in business suits nevertheless. This track aptly justifies "Men come to men... not mountains!" Ronit Roy  Simone Singh track is half-baked owing to lack of screen time. After an aggressive efforts and failed attempts (w.r.t "Kal Ho Na Ho") Simone Singh finally accepts that she cannot do away with her image and redo's "Heena" in the garb of doted Saima. Ronit Roy gets to showcase his dancing skills. BTW  in the end does it always have to be a melodramatic and they lived happily ever after? Om Puri:: No relevance to the story line. Tinch of Monsoon Wedding flavour? Viveck Shauq:: Again no relevance to the storyline and his laughter was getting on my nerves.The other teenagers track was absolute nonsense.Thanks to "Life in Metro" & the Mithoon band  we have an novel way to portraying the Bollywood songs.... with the playback singers appearing as "singing ghosts" (for a change its better than lip sync songs.... but doesn't that make non-Bollywood?).The story did have potential but the owing to multiple tracks the theme gets diluted and the characters do not get fleshed out adequately. On similar note, it would be wise to state that retaining the Jimmy  Neha track and editing out the rest would have given scope to add depth.PS: What was Maddy doing in this blink-n-miss role?" 
" complete waste of time","I love Delhi, everything about it, food, chaat, autos, smells, shopping, crowds. It's great when a movie really captures the soul of a city. Monsoon wedding succeeded in really portraying Delhi and Delhiites. Combined with a great story, wonderful actors and slick editing, it culminated into a brilliant movie.Delhi Heights fails on each of these points. A ridiculously dumb story. My cat could have written this story in half an hour. Some terrible acting. Most of the characters in this movie are down right annoying. Even Om Puri, who is usually nothing short of brilliant, was reduced to a blumbering Sikh. Many Hindi 'multi-starers' are just a combination of a few mediocre stories, in a bid to make the intersecting story more interesting.The only good thing about the movie is its music. Rabbi has done a fabulous job, very song is catchy. Some of the choreography isn't bad either.The verdict: don't waste your time watching it, just by the music disk." 
" Well","This movie was so totally interesting Songs are really enjoyable Storyline is good screenplay is superb background music is great editing is fine direction is fine Jimmy shergill does well as well he never fails to impress me and fansNeha is good rohit is amazing Simone is outstanding om puri is funny The chemistry between jimmy and neha was really fabulous 7/10" 
" Beautiful film","Delhi Heights is a beautiful film. Very well shot, gives a very serene feeling. It depicts marriage relationship between two Delhites. Modern working class professionals, how they get married and how they handle their married life problems. Music is good. A treat for Punjabis!!! A must watch film.Jimmy Shergill looks as beautiful as over. He golden hairdo really suits him. Neha Dhupia is a most underrated heroine in Indian Cinema. She is a talent house of acting. Very beautiful and amazing actor. Cinema has just wasted her talent. Watch it for the music and two beautiful actors Jimmy and Neha." 
" Terrible","Please don't waste your time with this movie. There is no drama, no comedy, no thrill, no excitement, no happiness, no sadness...basically it was really difficult to sense any emotions from this movie. There's hardly a climax to this story. I was waiting and waiting for the good part to come around, but that never came around. It was so boring. It had the potential to be a good movie, but they really screwed it up. I was disgusted at how terrible the acting was from the main characters. I liked how they showed the modern side of Delhi. I guess that is the only plus in the entire movie. Songs were horrible except "Tere Bin". Otherwise, save yourselves time & money and do not watch this."
