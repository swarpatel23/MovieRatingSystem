" What is this..a kids film or adult film.","Looking at the storyline, you can easily say it is a copy of Hollywood film 13 going on 30. What i don't understand is if the director is making an erotic film because it does have some love making scenes. Or maybe this movie is aimed at children since it has many childish scenes. The Hollywood version was obviously a flop, but this version is a little more worse. The girl in the movie gets bullied for being ugly and in the climax we don't see no kind of vengeance whether nice or naughty. Apparently her neighbour has a magic potion that makes you big, but once the potion is used how comes she, her rival and her friend get big too. The movie has many stupid scenes, it seems like a 5 year old handled this project. The main actors are a bunch of little kids who save the day, hunt the bad guys miraculously and very appallingly (In this one scene). Anyway, this film is suppose to be a low budget Grade B Movie so no surprise. Payal Rohatgi delivers a bad performance playing the role of a adult with a 15 year old mind. She is suppose to be 15, Most 15 year olds are a little mature, but she acts like a 3 year old, that doesn't seem to understand Life. Its not her fault its the director i guess. But, she dresses and looks very sexy so who cares about her acting. There are hot scenes by a newcomer Nepalese model Shivani Singh. Shivani looks very sexy and I sure would like to get naughty with her."
