" "You don't have to be a soldier to love your country"",""Kabhi kabhi ek chota sa kadam, zindagi bhar ka rah ban jata hai." The journey from Delhi to Punjab to Himachal Pradesh, and finally Leh was it for Saand and Nawab Saab. Students of a film academy,Saand and Nawabsaab, have to submit a documentary for their graduation, the topic in jest was decided "Why not to join the Indian Army", but becomes more serious each day. The two guys meet a war journalist who hands them three last letters of soldiers who died in service, Saand and Nawabsaab take it upon themselves to deliver these three letters in hand, and record the experience. Each letter brings with itself a realization of how family and friends of a soldier are affected.The first letter tells the story of a brave Punjabi soldier Balkaar Singh(Salman Khan), who leaves behind his parents, widow and child. Yet his every decision made his family and friends proud of him.The second letter tells the story of two brothers(Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol), one in Air Force, one in Army, and how bravery and courage runs in their blood, how they are more than happy to dedicated their life and more to their country.The third letter takes them to a young man Saahil (Dino Morea), who comes from a family of doctors, but joins the Army in spite of disapproval from his father.The movie is very pleasant and says there's more to patriotism than war, bullets and politics. The reason the movie works, is because it tells a normal story with a funny bone and gives out subtle messages of patriotism.In their own small way, Nawabsaab and Saand change the lives of the family of three great soldiers. They have made completed documentary, but does this journey end there? Will Nawaabsaab and Saand make their country proud ? Yes, they will. The ending is very touching." 
" 2 spoiled men learn more away from university than attending it.","3 powerful stories unfold as 2 men work on a film project to complete their education. (They are slackers, spoiled in their little world.) During the process they learn more about themselves than they realize. Wonderful powerful movie. Military (ex or current) world over can relate to this movie. Subtitles clear and easy to read. Preity Zinta has a powerful part, and it's wonderful to see her acting. All the acting is well done.The real countryside photography of India is truly amazing beautiful.I give this movie 9 stars or solid A.Be prepared to shed a few tears as this story is well done. Enjoy!" 
" good effort","first of all please don't force songs in movies, esp if it is not a musical. the movie had a great storyline, good camera-work, a few heart touching moments, but something was surely wrong. the movie lost its grip in the second half, a few scenes were unnecessarily added and the ending could have been better. overall the movie will definitely make you feel proud to be an Indian. its surely worth watching once.the movie is about two students who flunked in film making school and then decided to make a movie on why you should not join Indian armed forces. in the process they meet a war reporter. who give them a task to deliver the last letters of three kargil martyrs. the movie shows the changes in the two boys after they completed the task." 
" mera BHARAT mahaan","MERA BHARAT MAHAN ....yes this was the tittle decided earlier pretty apt. i would've gone with that. the story is very simple, n easy to relate with if you are an Indian. it has got a lot of heartwarming scenes , moments that get u goose bumps it brings out the meaning of"PRIDE" to the fullest. but i would not say that the movie is perfect it has got some flaws...like the sunny deol scene where he behaves like hulk ,punching through the tiles is totally unnecessary and some other scenes. other wise the movie is OK and fun to watch. if you rent it its a good bargain.but i would recommend watching it at the theaters.i'll repeat its not perfect but good for me n any of those who love their country." 
" It was FUN watchin it..","Boy i went to the theatre s*** scared fearing that bollywood will let the hell of boredom loose on me. But wat i get is a completely different film. A new concept tried is being tried over here. The movie tells the story of a 2 young men who go on a roadtrip to India and find our home made real life heroes. Wat i like about the movie is the entire feel they have given to it. Fun with some melodrama(not the usual one!!)and fun. Good thing about this movie is that they have not tried to convey a heavy message to the youth by using heavy dialogues n all. I am telling you seeing the fun these guys do while on a road trip on their bike..i am going to get me a bike and hit the roads. Explore the country and meet people of all the places. Believe me this film is not the usual run of the mill type bollywood film. Every actor has played their part with uplomb charisma and expertise. Sohail khan is real fun. The crazy whacky guy image suits him. I think for the first time i have seen sohail khan doing a role that has carved out for him and he has done justice to it. There are some beautiful shots of the Indian countryside. I am impressed by the director's use of visuals. Big things are said in a passing that's the USP of the film. Youngsters like me are busy trying to enter the rat race and become a part of the flock. This movie has given me motivation to do what i like the most. Finally i would like to say that this guy has done a great job breaking the mould of current Indian trend of storytelling which is marred by pointless terrorist attack films and other page 3 films. So i am giving him a high rating of 9 out of 10." 
" A Good Attempt, but could be better.","This season again we witness a movie on a plot inspired from the western cinema. "Heroes" is based on a theme borrowed from "The Motorcycle Diaries", where two friends are on a fun tour and their experiences in the journey change their outlook towards life. The good part about the Indian adaptation is that we have a patriotic feel introduced in the plot which makes it more inspiring and entertaining. "Heroes" is a good attempt as it has some well shot sequences and good acting by the famous faces, but it has its weaknesses too. The director Samir Karnik has done a far better job if compared with his earlier offerings. First I would like to take the good things about the movie. The story revolves around three letters to be delivered by the lead duo to the families of military men who have sacrificed their lives in the war. Sohail Khan and Vatsal Sheth are the two men who are on the journey and they have to do this task as their film-making assignment to be submitted. So they are also shooting their experiences on the way. Out of these three stories interwoven in the script, the first one with the Punjabi flavor is the best, second about two brothers is OK and the third one is the weakest with only one well shot sequence.The first story with the Punjab background has Priety Zinta and Salman Khan playing Sikh characters. Sikhism seems to be the current craze in Bollywood and after "Singh Is King" every second project has something to offer in this direction, trying to cash the same. The top most performance in the movie is by Priety Zinta as the quite but strong women ready to fight the world alone. Salman Khan plays the tough guy, does a good job, but I couldn't understand why he is made to speak a language which is neither Hindi nor Punjabi. The dialogues sound awful in the half baked lingo and could have been better. The child actor playing their son is good and confident. Salman Khan as a Sikh military man, looks smart and tough. This is the best part of the movie on a novel theme.The second story is about two brothers Sunny Deol & Bobby Deol serving the country. Sunny is in Air force and Bobby guarding the ground in Armed forces. It's worth watching seeing the two reel & real life brothers fighting over which force serves the country best. Here Sunny Deol tries hard to portray a man who has lost his legs in war, but as usual he can still fight with more than 10 men in a pub. He tries to put extra effort in his act which shows. Bobby has very few scenes in which he does fine. So this part of the movie is just OK to watch.The third story featuring Mithun Chakraborty & Dino is the weakest among the three as no one gets a well written role and the veteran Mithun Da is wasted. However, there is one sequence in this weak part, which is brilliantly thought, well written and beautifully executed, which also makes the movie watchable.The sequence is about an audio tape recorded by Dino while he is fighting on the war front. Incidentally while the recording is on, he is shot and dies on the spot, which all gets recorded on the tape. The same tape is sent to his family as his last things. The sequence where his mother listens to the tape in front of Sohail and Vatsal Sheth is a treat to watch and should not be missed at all. Now let us come to the shortcomings of the movie. First of all, out of the two lead characters on the journey, Vatsal Sheth has nothing to offer in the film. If you think of the screenplay with only Sohail traveling around alone, then also the film would have been the same. So Vatsal has no personal contribution to make in the proceedings and is simply a miscast.Secondly, I was not able to understand what was the purpose of first 15 minutes of the movie, with all those party and men stripping scenes. The start of the movie, featuring Riya Sen & Amrita Arora, in an eye blinking role is completely out of place and script. The film should have started straight from the film school scene and then on to the main plot. This would have resulted in a more crispier and tighter screenplay with all the emphasis on the main theme.And lastly the third story did not have the right feeling which was required for the finale of the movie. Instead it ruined all the ambiance created by the first two and thus resulted in a weaker climax.Cinematography of the movie is competent as it captures the beauty of the outdoors in the right spirit. The border fence scenes are very well shot. Musically the film has some unwanted songs along with a well sung and melodious song "Main Mangiyan Si Janntan" rendered by the one and only Sonu Nigam. But the lyrics of the song left me spellbound with the liberty writer takes to write his lines.Sample this, "Tera Mera Viyah Sohni Chheti Je Karayiye, Agli Basantan Mainu Santa Banta Chahiye". These lines only represent the down sliding of lyrics in our Hindi film songs. I can only hope that the golden days of "Urdu Shayri" in film songs return back.To summarize, "Heroes" is a movie which can be seen once and is surely capable of entertaining you with a pinch of patriotic feel. But it could have been an appreciable product with a different starting and better casting. Still a very good leap ahead towards quality by its director." 
" Watch the first chapter, and then turn it off","Heroes does have a good premise, but as a whole it is a waste of a good story. This is because Samir Karnik insists making it the old way, with lots of drama, exaggeration and highly unconvincing action scenes. To think of two guys travelling huge distances to meet three different families of slain soldiers and surprise them with letters written by the soldiers before their death during the Kargil war, sounds very promising, but the way the subject is handled is just so amateur old fashioned. This relates in particular to the two last chapters of the three, with Sunny Deol and Mithun Chakraborty, who lost a brother and a son, respectively. As moving as it was, this just didn't work because of flawed direction. The first chapter, however, is a true redeeming quality, which at times even seems to have been made or written by someone else, not that it's perfect in or by itself. Salman Khan and Preity Zinta have brilliant chemistry together, and the part is handled quite sensitively, in addition to having one beautiful song called "Mannata". This, sadly, turns out to be the only truly moving part of the movie, and sadly so, because the concept is most novel, and it's got many famous stars who could have made something out of it. Unfortunately, Karnik cannot really save the film from being uninspiring (though, as said, in parts it is), which is sad because this is clearly its main goal. Speaking of stars and inspiration, there's one saving grace in Heroes, and it's a huge one because acting-wise, none comes close to Preity Zinta. As Kuljeet Kaur, the young and lonely widow, Zinta utterly steals the show with an amazing performance which is not only the best in the film, but one of the finest of that year in Hindi movies. Her Punjabi dialect is brilliant, but more than that, it is her subtle, understated and authentic portrayal of Kuljeet's anguish, resilience and strength, which stays with you after the show is over (in spite of the fact that, naturally, she does not have a lot of screen time). Her presence alone speaks volumes. It's sad that this inspiring act is wasted in such an average film, but happily, her episode on its own is very good to be worthy of a second watch. Salman Khan is also very effective and natural and fits the role well enough. Mithun Chakraborty is always good, but Sunny Deol is a disappointment. Bobby Deol and Dino Morea are quite okay. Vatsal Sheth and Sohail Khan are not important characters and they do not really word well together, but they are lively enough even though Sohail is sadly but expectedly just not convincing enough. Anyway, Heroes is an average movie with some good moments, namely the first episode and Preity Zinta's performance. Watch only the first one, you may want to proceed, at your own cost." 
" Heroes is a new age Masterpiece!","Samir Karnik's 'Heroes' is easily the best film of 2008. An outstanding, fantastic, excellent and astounding film. A Winnner All The Way! The film fared well at the box office, but sadly the film has not got any awards which it deserves. Its an outstanding film and Samir Karnik surely makes a film of a lifetime. Performances: Mithun Chakraborty once again proves why he is regarded a Legend, he's outstanding. Salman Khan is marvelous. Sunny Deol shines with a great performance. Bobby Deol is superb in a cameo. Sohail Khan and Vatsal Seth do well. Dino is excellent in a brief appearance. Preity Zinta is matchless. Riya Sen and Amrita Arora make able appearances. Dwij Yadav is also fantastic. Monish Bhel is good.Two Thumbs Way Up!" 
" A Subtext In Need Of A Better Film","When someone mentions the phrase " anti war film " it sums up many images . Perhaps it may involve good Germans doing their duty for the nation state which has been hijacked by genocidal maniacs and both CROSS OF IRON and DAS BOOT spring instantly to mind . It may involve teenage GIs fighting and dying in the jungles of South East Asia . We all have our favourite anti war films . Indeed my own favourite film of all time is APOCALYPSE NOW while my all time favourite documentary is Morgan Matthews 2008 gut wrenching , heartbreaking tribute to the British war dead from the war on terror THE FALLEN . HEROES is another anti war film featuring the aftermath of the Kargil war between India and Pakistan . The problem is that it's a Bollywood movie which means we're subjected to shoehorning song and dance numbers between the poignant moments Actually I'm lying slightly because there are no poignant moments . There are clichéd moments , stilted moments and just plain boring moments . In fact it's impossible to understand what the point of the film is: war is hell ? Thanks we all knew that already but the story is impossible to take seriously . We see a Sihk being interviewed on TV where he makes a rambling speech about the good old days when emperors and kings would face each other man to man ( Hmmm wouldn't that be a court martial offence ? ) A airforce pilot in a wheelchair ( No don't ask how he was crippled for life because it's never revealed ) and worst of all the story revolves around a couple of conchie pacifist students who after delivering death letters to the families of the bereaved become patriots of the motherland with the greatest of respect for the nation's fighting man . None of this is ever convincing in any shape or form There is one thing that makes HEROES watchable and that is the music and choreography . Fair enough , like a great many of other Bollywood movies the singing and dancing can be very hit and miss and this film is no different Some of the musical numbers don't work but when they do such as the show stopping Makhana number they work very well . Such a pity the song and dance jar with the very serious subtext of young men dying in battle and of the grief this leaves behind" 
" Could have been Rang De Basanti ver. 2008","Comparisions to Motorcycle Diarries  lets not go there.Sohail Khan:: His performance is good in parts. His attempt to be "cool" is annoying while the serious/ emotional side suits him. Should stop showing off his muscular side every time. Vatsal Seth:: Good looks, but needs more time to mark a stamp about his performance. Amrita Arora & Riya Sen:: Force fit for the intro song and the inane comedy. The role should have been simply purged.Mohnish Behl:: Small role but does it well (and age is catching up!)Chapter #1: The best, IMO. Salman is OK and his patriotic lines seems to be inspired from Sunny's movies. Preity excels (thanks to her stint with the parallel cinema and it shows!). The confession to the uniform is not warranted. The young Jassi leaves a mark.Chapter #2: Bobby is OK but it is Sunny who messes up big time. He attempts to do a Hum Dono Dev Anand and ends up creating a caricature. And what was Hrishitaa Bhatt was doing there?Chapter #3:: Dino Morea doesn't have a role at all. Prateeksha Lonkar delivers a good performance. And its is Mithun who gives a performance which belongs to "Bollywood 1980". Now we know why he was lost in oblivion.The transformation a.k.a enlightenment should have been a natural progression rather than in spikes. And the end was definitely OTT (the grey hair, school, Jassi et all). Why can't it be a silent realisation?Had more time/ effort spent on screenplay/ script we could have seen another Rang De! And yes the original title "Mera Bharat Mahaan" would have been apt." 
" Worth Warching.","I went to see this movie, without having much idea as to what it really was about but then the title almost gave it away  Army.Director Samir Karnik has handled the topic of the movie in what can only be said as a very well manner and has used the 1999 Kargil conflict as the back ground to the story in which he unfolds stories relating three soldiers who are killed after they give interview on a TV channel during the conflict. This reflects to the real life incident regarding the late Captain Vikram Batra, who many remember almost nine years after the conflict  as he gave an interview during the conflict and was later killed in action. The movie portrays what happens to those family members who are left behind by their beloved ones when they are killed in a conflict whether it is Kargil, Afghanistan or Iraq.The location setting also goes on to give the atmosphere of the area in which the conflict was fought and goes on to resurrect what village life is like for many of the families whose sons have joined the Army and how each one of them cope with the loss.The movie seems to be a bit boring at the beginning but then it changes gear and the pace begins and manages to gain the audience attention and maintains that all the way through.It makes a change to see Salman Khan wearing a turban and not removing his shirt, however, his performance could have been better but never the less, it is semi memorable, while his co  star, Preity Zinta has suited the role of a village woman, who has to take care of her family and perhaps can be considered as a memorable one but it cannot be compared to "Veer Zaara". Other memorable performances are by Sunny Deol as an ex  Air Force pilot who becomes disabled and has had to learn how to live and also Mithun Chakraborthy as a father who is unable bear the loss. But one actor has really gone up the scale in his performance is by Sohail Khan, as a youngster who is on a mission to make a documentary on the three families. Mohnish Behl also makes a friendly appearance.Conclusion: The movie does echo the Katgil conflict in many ways more than one but it is worth while watching." 
" Excellent Movie!","This movie really touches your heart as two boys discover the pain of the parents and relatives of the three martyr soldiers. Bhalkaar Singh, DJ Shergill, and Sahil Naqvi. They start making a movie on why not to join the Indian army because it causes pain to the parents and relatives when they find out that their son/brother/husband is dead. The two boy's job is to deliver three letters that were the last letters of the three martyrs and deliver them to the parents and relatives of the martyrs. By the end they discover that to do something for the country is better than living a life of a loser. In the end the son of Salmaan Khan comes back to them because when they visited Punjab they made friends with Salmaan Khan's son and he comes back as a soldier." 
" could have been better","It breaks my heart to give a 5 star rating to this film. Again like many other Bollywood movies, this one had great potential. The story was new and the movie boasted of such a terrific star cast in Salman Khan, Preity Zinta, Sunny Deol and Mithun da. I would like to request bollywood directors to please never cast Salman again as a Sardar because he did not suited the Surd image at all. He did not looked like a sikh for one moment. And I really fail to understand that why has Sunny Deol to be portrayed as Hulkesque in every movie. Breaking ground with his punches, fighting 15-20 guys despite being a handicap come on.... give us a break. Alright he is strong, he terrorized the entire Pakistan in Gadar, but guys get over it. Let him be a normal man again. Otherwise, the story was good, and I felt that this movie could have had a Rang de Basanti kind of impact. I wish that it would have been made better with some more emotional quotient. This could have been the movie of the year, but bollywood being bollywood, made it what it is. Its alright, we are getting there slowly but still getting there (Hollywood level)." 
" Underrated movie","A very good coming off age movie in a sense.
The movie tries to show us the sacrifices of armed forces and their family in a realistic way ( well at least to some extent)The director basically threw a spanner in this good movie by the stupid superhuman glorification of Sunny Deol's character which was not needed. A handicapped guy cracking the floor of a disco and unnecessary over acting by Sunny spoilt an otherwise good movie.Even the last story was found wanting, as if the writer wrote the story in a hurry and couldn't think of a better storyline. But it was not as bad as the second story involving Sunny.A very good concept and surprisingly good acting by vatsal and Sohail. Only if the writer and director had spent more time on the script and director, or if the director had dealt the subject with more maturity, this would have been an awesome movie.Speaking off poor scriptwriting, the movie shows Monish Behl as a responsible journalist, yet it offers no explanation as to why he didn't post the 3 death letters, which he should have logically posted at first opportunity. And it also didn't make sense why after many years he gave the letters to the Sohail and his friend to hand deliver.Also why rich kids like Sohail took a bike for the letter delivery and not a car didn't also make sense.That's why overall I felt they screwed up an opportunity to make a really good movie.It is still a good watch despite it's flaws." 
" Star-Studded Tear-Jerker","Two film school slackers, Ali (Vatsal Sheth) and Sameer (Sohail Khan), are required to make a movie to graduate. They decide they'll make it on "why not to join the Indian Armed Forces". To help with their movie, a war correspondent gives them three letters, each from a Killed In Action soldier, to deliver to the respective families.One is for Kuljeet Kaur (Preity Zinta), widow of Balkar Singh (Salman Khan). The second is for former Air Force pilot Vikram Shergill (Sunny Deol), from his Army officer brother, Dhananjay (played by Sunny's real-life brother, Bobby Deol). The final letter is to be delivered to a Regiment commander, who in turn gives them one to take to Mr. and Mrs. Naqvi (played by Mithun Chakraborty and Prateeksha Lonkar) from their son Sahil (Dino Morea).Ali and Sameer find the delivery of these letters takes their film in a direction they never suspected.The film starts well, but then when our slackers are introduced, becomes a disagreeable slapstick. However, if you get past minutes 8 through 17 (fast forward is my recommendation), you are in for a solidly acted, well-written movie. Most of the songs leave something to be desired, but the love song is quite nice. It's obvious early on that this star-studded tear-jerker is a paean to Mother India, but that agenda doesn't lessen the power of the movie. The viewer is left with both the blatant message "you don't have to be a soldier to love your country", and the satisfaction of a good film." 
" Best Indian Movie","I went to the theater thing that here goes another bad attempt at bollywood to make a movie. But when I saw it a was amazed beyond my expectation! I mean this movie was completely different than any other movie I have ever seen. Two spoiled movie flunks learn what it is like to live a soldier's family's life. I mean every scene was of great importance and some scenes just made me want to cry. This movie is really affectionate and if you enjoy movies that make you cry with amazing acting and amazing everything then this is the perfect movie for you. I mean bollywood hats off to you guys. If you keep this up in a few years then Hollywood is going to be demanding the filmfare instead of you demanding the Oscar."
