" Is long-drawn but has a nice theme","The publicity for this movie was very misleading by showcasing it as a romantic comedy about Arshad Warsi and Mahima. These two just play two of the many characters in this film. The movie takes a look in an episodical fashion at several struggling couples who are stuck at an airport due to a long delay of their flight. These couples are either lost loves, broken hearts, on the verge of divorce, or divorc√©es. The idea is interesting, but it is not executed well. The movie becomes extremely long-drawn and boring. The audience begins to get as impatient as the characters in the movie waiting to board their flight. What I mainly got out of this film is that in today's busy world, we are all running around, struggling to stay on top of schedule, and end up ignoring, hurting, and miscommunicating with those who mean most to us. All it takes is a few "forced" hours of conversation with no distractions to clear up misunderstandings, lucidly see the other's point of view, and realize where one's position in life is. We need to shell out time for our loved ones and communicate with them to avoid broken relationships and/or unnecessary anger/hurt/fear. Mahima and "the crier" gave good performances. Arshad Warsi should stick to comedies and supporting roles as in Munnabhai and Salaam Namaste. Shahrukh's special appearance was really pointless." 
" A Nice Pastry, A bad Icing","This movie is one of a kind, the kind which never gets repeated usually in Hindi cinema. You feel like getting in love with This movie, if you ignore the direction part of it. It (the movie) is about a small airport with it's daily routine, and one fine day, a plane gets out of order, leaving a few stranded people on the air terminal. The people are thrown out of their hectic schedules and now have a lot of time at their hand... There's a pilot and an air hostess, The air hostess having a baby of the pilot, A divorced couple with an 11 yr old daughter returning back to their respective destinations (?) after a get together of a day per year schedule, A couple almost on the breakpoint of their marriage, a teenage pair of internet lovers having met for the first time, an Italian NRI wanting an Indian bride, A gujju bhai always on his cell phone, a newly wed couple with an excessively domineering wife, their parent in laws (the widowed father of the groom romancing the aunt of bride!), the airport manager and his assistant with a baggage carrier with a lost hen. A long list of characters and some of them redundant, and some of them wasted! A character who has no role to play in the movie is redundant and a character who is not optimally used is wasted. The gujju bhai, the teacher and the monk (did i tell you about this American "hare rama hare krishna" monk here?) are redundant. Absolutely no use in this story. Arshad Warsi has improved himself a lot from his "Tere Mere Sapne" times. His maturity shows up as an actor (here as a manager), sometimes smiling and sharing a few smiles here and a few grins there, and sometimes as a man who retrospects at his past, when he sees his love Mahima as someone else's wife. He and Sachin Khedekar stand apart from rest of the crew in that small airport. Sorry to say, but Arshad Warsi had more to say in the movie, and Sandhya Mridul (as the air hostess), the less said the better. She had no point in her sad story. And Of course there is this sleeping guardian angel (He is the surprise angle) from whom i had heightened expectations, that, in a flash he would relieve all the miseries of these deserted people, but alas! he joins the wasted group. The Cinematographer has done a good work and Himesh Reshammiya, as a music director excels in delivering a list of good smooth and free flowing numbers, especially Bhool jayenge hum, and a Thumri Number which is played in between. The script is so strong it takes you on her shoulders, even if the direction fails! It is a dreamy movie, watch it with dreamy eyes, you will love it's script, i did!"
