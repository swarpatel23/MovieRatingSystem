" The movie does not have any plot or storyline.","This movie makes a first in all aspects of making a movie. First time Director, First time Producer, First time Actors and First time Actress and the rest is history. A bad product made by a bunch of amateurs.The plot in which the movie revolves is an old outdated plot which as failed whenever anybody tried to make any sense out of it. In the global village concept, it becomes very difficult to understand that a village simpleton needs tutoring to change the way he dresses and behaves. In the advent of satellite televisions like MTV, Fashion TV and many more such channels, one needs to only keep ones eyes open for changes in ones lives."
