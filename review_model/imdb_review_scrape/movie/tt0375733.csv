" Good movie","This movie is definitely different from your typical Bollywood movies. For one, it doesnt have any songs. This movie is about a Police Inspector who unwillingly kills some disillusioned individuals in an encounter. The main story picks up after that. It is about the inspector's struggle to find information about the killed guys. Naseer as usual is a versatile actor. He plays the part of the Parsi-inspector in such an excellent fashion that you wonder why such movies are not made frequently but then when you hear that this movie did not do well in India, you understand why..(not enough mass appeal). I recommend this movie for anyone who doesnt mind watching a different movie which touches upon an important subject."
