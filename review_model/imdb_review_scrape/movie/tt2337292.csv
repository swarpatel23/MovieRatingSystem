" A different Movie.","This movie is clean its not a typical Bollywood movie these days you can see this movie with family. No cheap songs no suggestive innuendos. Lot of comedy but without descending to cheap comedy tactics just to get laughs. The script is really creative and even better movie. The movie is free of any awkwardness that happens when you are sitting with family and they start using foul language or start a suggestive dances. These kind of shenanigans show weak creativity and extremely poor screenplay writing. The movie is about a small time criminal trying to leave behind the life of crime. He is trying to earn money different ways then meets a girl who is looking for an apartment then tries to impress her in many different ways the girl shows interest in his previous life and wants to know about it he tries to show her how the pick pockets use the distraction to steal. But then the plot becomes interesting. This is movie is not a copy of any Hollywood films or Remake of any old Bollywood movies. Overall the movie is a light hearted comedy that can be watched with whole family." 
" Real characters, creates magic, great dialogs.","True blue bollywood movie (evolved version) with a spirit, rib tickling dialogs and each character shines through. This movie does not have one hero... and certainly not one good looking, dashing hero. It presents real people with flaws who shine through the faded glass. The plot is the hero. What we see is bollywood getting real and delivering a well put together story with loads of laughter.This movie gives a nice bollywood kick sans the predictability and boring glorification. Awesome laughs, great dialogs. 'Chor Chor Super Chor' is highly recommended. Deepak Dobriyal is supremely talented and the movie is worth watching again for it's dialogs...Delhi style. Enjoy!"
