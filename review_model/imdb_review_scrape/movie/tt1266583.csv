" Mumbai gets its film","The great city of Mumbai got its song in 1956. It was written by Majrooh Sultanpuri, composed by O.P. Nayyar and sung by Mohd. Rafi and Geeta Bali - 'Ae dil hai mushkil jeena yahan..' from the film CID. It took more than half a century since then for Mumbai to get its film. 'Mumbai Meri Jaan' is that film.Nishikant Kamat (director) and Yogesh Joshi (writer) have created a brilliant film. It starts slow and cautious but the graph keeps on rising steadily throughout the duration of the film. 'Mumbai Meri Jaan' chronicles the few days before and after the Mumbai serial blasts of 2006 in the lives of 5 characters played by Kay Kay Menon, Soha Ali Khan, Irfan Khan, Paresh Rawal and Madhavan. That list has some of the very good actors in Hindi film industry today. None of then disappoint. Every one of them has got into the skin of their character, and be assured they are no simple characters.The story is beautifully written. It gives space to all the characters. Each one is well defined. It captures their fears, failures, prejudices and agony flawlessly. It takes us from one character to the other and all the stories blend seamlessly. The editing is clean, though it could have been a little more stringent to cut the running length of the film a little.Why Mumbai Meri Jaan really clicks is because it is about real people in a real world. The vast expanses that it covers in its limited premise is amazing. There is a Paresh Rawal who is reflecting at his 36 years as a policeman. When we hear him out completely it is difficult to decide whether he is a loser or winner. The wrinkles on his face, his gray hairs, his spectacle-aided vision - is there a better metaphor than himself for the city he lives in? There is a Madhavan who can get what he wants. He has the money to buy a car, has the opportunities to migrate to Europe or America. But should he? We don't really know at the end. It is for some reason that a tear drop sliding over his cheeks is the closing shot of the film. Kay Kay Menon and Irfan Khan are great actors. They have added dimensions to their characters which I doubt even the writer knew existed. The Soha Ali Khan segment takes a dig at the news channels of today. It is raises a lot of obvious questions.Nishikant Kamat is a director to look out for. He uses various devices like close-ups, short quick cuts, looking upwards shots, silence, stills, jarring music, almost everything. But all are in moderation. So the end result looks plain and clean - possibly the most difficult thing to do in Hindi film industry today.It was only befitting that the film end with the C.I.D song. A must watch." 
" Outstanding.. what else can we say!!!","An outstanding creative work by UTV Motion Pictures depicting the true Spirit of Mumbai with shades of every aspect. KK, Madhavan, Irfan, Soha and Paresh Rawal were extravagant. All of them try tackling their issue on their own. And by the end of it, all of them move on in life. And that has been portrayed as the 'spirit of Mumbai'. Hence the name  "Mumbai Meri Jaan". The movie presents the difference in various point of views from which people looked at the incidence of Mumbai Train Blasts in July 2006. At one level, it shows how there are people who overcame the fear of bomb blasts and moved on in life as if nothing has changed. While there is another sect of people whose lives have forever been unsettled because of this incident.In all, the movie deserves an A+, and is a must watch." 
" Indian Masterpiece on Terrorism","I just watched this movie today. I have not gone in theater with some mind setup that I will see this and that, but in real meaning I was willing there a lot to see and director did the job fantastically. No errors there. He gone through the subject so intelligently that you cannot find a place where he slipped out of the main theme. Every moment and movement of the movie showing you the motive of the director of making this movie to hit on the right place of equality of different religions which is mainly Hindu Muslim.The thing which I like the most is the bomb blast scene that made a huge impact on me as it is a short budget movie and they made i can say a shocking and horrifying scene there. This is i am talking in technical manner.There were quite good emotional moments like hitting on media how badly they react to the situation and what happens when it came on to the people who are the part of the media (that made people clap in the theater). There were lot of places where people were clapping, that I can say was all for the director only as he is the one who handled the movie so brilliantly.Overall, I must say this should be watched by every Hindu Muslim and others too, should be tax free soon that all get a bite of it. Anyways it is going to be in my DVD collection.Excellent Work Nishikant" 
" A Tribute Not Just To Mumbai But Can Also Be Applied To Others As Well.","I only had inkling on what this would be about and that's all. But was totally amazed when I saw the contents of it  some reality which I haven't seen in a Bollywood film for a very long time.The title is derived from the golden oldie, "CID" and sung by the late Mohd Rafi and Geeta Bali and composed by the O.P. Nayyar and it is a favourite song of mine and above all it describes the city of Mumbai. While this film, which depicts on how the people of the city were able cope with the bomb blasts that took place on July 11 2006. It deals with peoples' emotions and how they are able to handle it.A Policeman, who is about to retire and how he is able to reflect on his time in the force, an aspiring journalist who covers tragic stories but unknown to her, her world crumbles when she faces such situation herself, an unemployed computer engineer who suspects people around him to be the terrorists but soon realises that not everyone is and finally a coffee vendor who is struggling to survive  they are the characters that all come together in this movie, a magnificent tribute to the city of Mumbai. But looking more further afield, this movie can also apply to other cities in this world that has changed so much since September 11 2001, cities such as New York, London and Madrid, who have faced the same dilemmas. This is what the director Nishkant Kamat has tried to portray.Soha Ali Khan, has once again excelled like she did in "Khoya Khoya Chand" as the aspiring journalist, Kay Kay Menon, as the young unemployed computer engineer is very convincing in his role as a person who suspects people around him. Finally, Paresh Rawal, as the Policeman who is about to retire is just superb and is able to portray as to how his character feels about what he has achieved during his time in the force. But what is the icing is the song that comes in at the end when the credits begin to roll in.This is a very appealing film that is worth watching and is capable of putting other movies, such as "Singh is Kinng" several steps behind." 
" Movie of the year","Last weekend we saw the movie 'Mumbai Meri Jaan'. I think it may get all the awards for this year!! Best director for sure, storyline, and there will be a fight for the Best supporting title within the movie... I still can't decide if Paresh Rawal did well or Madhavan or Kay Kay Menon... Probably Paresh. Irrfan Khan finally has taken a different role than his usually 'monotonous monologue role' which sounds like a Vodafone commercial. This time he has chosen a role which will really challenge him. Soha Ali Khan is great... needless to say it runs in the family.This is not a commercial masala film. No dream sequences, no item numbers. Shot more like a documentary but extremely gripping. The director Nishikant Kamath makes is Hindi-movie directorial debt and surpasses all standards and sets a new one. We should keep in mind though that he has won many national awards for this previous Marathi movie, 'Dombivili Fast'.I don't want to tell you what the movie is about, besides the fact that its based on seven bomb blast that happened in Mumbai trains a couple of years ago. Shows you the ground reality and and its effects it has on people and their relatives... not a movie for a weak heart some scenes are really horrifying and morbid. Definitely a 'no-no' for kids. I guess it for grown ups... not just physically grown-up but also mentally evolved ones ;-) .Shatters all our prejudices and preconceived notions that we have about life in general when a catastrophe happens. How we take everything for granted unless it happens to you. This movie will make a difference.... this is the only movie I have seen in an Indian theater where the whole crowd clapped at the of the movie and was silent during the end credits.If you have no plans this weekend... go watch it. Worth every penny!! Siskel and Ebert would have given it 2 thumbs up. I give all my 10 fingers ;-))" 
" A must watch movie","This is one of the best drama terrorism movie ever made.The whole story is concentrated on five people's life after the bomb attack in mumbai.Every character is so real.We can feel that the all characters are live and we know them.The screenplay of this movie is just awesome.Paresh raval has done his best work till date.Paresh Raval(Tukaram Patil) is retiring from the job of policeman and then the bomb blasts occur in the city.And how this bomb blast effect these five people's life is the story of this movie. At the end the speech of Paresh Raval(Tukaram Patil) covers the whole theme of the movie.Nishikant Kamat has done brilliant job as director. If you like the drama movie then you must see this masterpiece." 
" Engrossing Cinema","Mumbai Meri Jaan released last week and it had my dream cast in it,so I couldn't dare to miss this one..Kay Kay,Irfan,Paresh..wow...What else do I want??? The film tells the story of 6 lives ,very different from each other,in terms of background, yet close to each other,in terms of frustration & solidarity.The film is about the Mumbai train blasts but its not,"only" about the blasts.It peeps into the lives of rich and poor, dangerous and foolish, corruption and morality and ends up showcasing ,that in the end we all have a heart which despite facing several pains,still manages to beat in a way,which is as beautiful as Mozart's Symphony No. 40.The performances are top notch but Kay Kay is the one who is ahead of the rest. Paresh Rawal has the most author backed role and he does ,what is expected of him,i.e. deliver a knock out performance. Irfan has done fantastically well,but I wish,he had got some more scenes.Soha and Madhavan are adequate,but its Kay Kay, Paresh and Irfan,who make this movie reach the highest level.A wonderful and a brilliant film with the song placement in the last scene ,being a masterstroke.my rating- 8 out of 10" 
" A landmark film with a brilliant ensemble cast!","We finally have a winner, folks. After 8 months into a decidedly lacklustre year for Bollywood ("Aamir" being the only really good movie in a year populated by the Races, Sinngh is Kinngs and Bachna Ae Haseenos), we have "Mumbai Meri Jaan", the first GREAT film of 2008. Directed by the immensely talented Nishikant Kamat  the man who made the superlative Marathi feature "Dombivili Fast"  this is a beautifully made, kaleidoscopic portrait of aamchi Mumbai limping back to normalcy after the 7/11 serial bomb blasts two years ago.Nishikant Kamat deserves a big pat on his back for scripting and directing this feature with a lot of heart and a lot of vigour. India's answer to the Oscar-winning "Crash", this one features a multithreaded storyline consisting of common Mumbai citizens  from Kay Kay Menon's Suresh, an out-of-work computer salesman who is mistrustful of the Muslim community to R. Madhavan's Nikhil Aggarwal, an idealistic corporate yuppie, who shuns "the better life" abroad to stay in his own country and improve it. On the other hand we have Roopali Joshi (Soha Ali Khan), a maverick journalist for a leading TV news channel, for whom the tragedy becomes personal when she finds out her fiancé also died in the blasts, and who, once perpetrator, finds herself an exploited victim of the merciless fourth estate. Paresh Rawal, in one of his greatest performances  on par with himself in Ketan Mehta's "Sardar"  plays Tukaram Patil, an aging cop due for retirement, prone to spouting out philosophy and humour in the same breath. Under his wing is rookie cop Sunil Kadam (Vijay Maurya), seething with self-righteous, idealistic rage at corruption and apathy, and also because his honeymoon got cancelled thanks to the bomb blasts. And last, we have Irrfan Khan as a Madrasi coffee vendor struggling to make ends meet and to attain status and respect in a city where money talks. He learns about how fear and panic can be generated instantly  and all it costs is a rupee.The writing is fabulous. It is a very, very rare Hindi film that does not sound scripted. Listening to the characters in this movie talk is like listening to conversations taking place in the local train, or in the table next to you at a restaurant. The characterization is precise; each character looks like and sounds like the character he or she is, and nobody lives in outlandish bungalows or drives fancy cars (Indeed, Madhavan's Nikhil spends much of his time convincing everyone why he prefers commuting by train instead of buying a car, which he can obviously afford.) The dialogue is crisp, infused with sarcastic, deadpan humour and is really worth listening to. Each line of it. How long has it been since we've had a movie like that?Mercifully, aside from the Kay Kay Menon track  and it's done in a subtle manner there, too  Kamat avoids playing around too much with the done-to-death Hindu-Muslim rivalry and communal and political overtones. What is shown instead, is a more realistic slice-of-life where the day after the blasts, the only thing Mumbaikars were worried about was how to travel in the train and beating the early morning rush. We see Suresh struggling to resolve fundamental conflicts - he needs money but refuses to take a lucrative order for a company owned by a Muslim. Roopali, a ruthless journo, is exploited by her own news channel for a story dealing with her personal loss. It's a sharp critique of the media and their wanton abandonment of ethics as they cash in on the tragedy  remember the Aarushi case recently?  and Kamat handles it well. If it seems like a caricature, one must remember that T.V. news channels are just that nowadays.Mumbai Meri Jaan also boasts of excellent cinematography by Sanjay Jadhav, and a very good background score by Sameer Phaterpekaris which is extremely apt, despite being a trifle over-orchestrated. The editing is laser-sharp, cutting back and forth between the several story lines in a manner that is coherent and yet paces the film well. But the real star is the direction. Nishikant Kamat proves his mettle as one of the brightest new talents out there. Meticulous attention to detail and some brilliant shots (I loved the one where Vijay Maurya goes out of the police station and stands in the rain  very Janusz Kaminiski-like) make this one of the most brilliantly directed films in ages. It has National Award written all over it.If I must nitpick, I could grumble about the shockingly shoddy special effects depicting the train blast. But I won't, for two reasons. One, because it's a well known fact that movies like MMJ are made on budgets which are roughly a third of, say, two songs from any given Yash Raj film. Secondly, it was about 30 seconds long and I didn't feel that the impact had been diluted at all.And finally, what can one say about a cast that already looks so great on paper? This is the ensemble performance of the year with everyone giving at least career-best performances. Kay Kay, Madhavan and Soha Ali Khan are brilliant, Vijay Maurya is stunning, and Paresh Rawal reaffirms his status as one of the greatest actors in this country (no thanks to Priyadarshan for wasting him in mindless comedies). But the scene-stealer is none other than the chameleon-like Irrfan Khan. In a role where he doesn't have too much screen time, very little dialogue (much of it in Tamil), Irrfan is heart-breakingly good, conveying everything through his eyes. Is there a more versatile character actor than him today? Doubtful.I conclude with two words. Tax-Free. NOW." 
" a must watch movie","a truly outstanding movie...it touches your heart...and forces u to think about it...a must watch....it should be made compulsory for media whose standards have fallen....a movie which can make u cry....which salutes the spirit of mumbai...the spirit of India...the spirit of humanity....and it does so through the lives of ordinary persons to whom we can relate...a movie with excellent acting from one and all....the best part of the movie is never over the board...there is a bit of all the protagonists in all of us...the movie is so realistic and soul stirring and when u leave theater your eyes are moist not from sadness but from a sense of pride in the spirit shown by mumbaikars" 
" Brilliant movie--good treatment of a sensitive subject","A brilliant movie that showcases few days before and after the Mumbai serial blasts of 2006 in the lives of five different, unrelated characters: Software Engineer Madhavan, constable Paresh Rawal, roadside coffee vendor Irfan Khan, TV reporter Soha Ali Khan, and a Hindu fanatic Kay Kay Menon, and everyone has lived to expectations. Each parallel plot is a story in itself that becomes interesting as the movie progresses. The movie touches many issues: Soha being interviewed by colleagues about her fiancé's death, the loser constable reflecting on his idle police service at retirement, software engineer considering fleeing the country, Hindu extremist bridging the Hindu-Muslim divide. Light traces of humor can be found in Kay Kay's anger, Paresh Rawal's sadness, and Irfan's helplessness. The blast scene is a bit gory and painful to watch, but could be very close to reality. Amazing talent shown by director Nishikant Kamath in his first Hindi movie after just one Tamil and one Marathi movie. Though a bit heavy, a must watch. The end leaves you lighter with the evergreen song from CID that gave the movie its name." 
" Truly Awesome Movie","How many time do you get to see movies which actually touch your heart not just once but through each and every character of the movie ? Well.. Mumbai Meri Jaan is one of those movies. The beauty of the movie is the realistic characters, realistic dialogs, good story, powerful acting, amazing direction, emotional climax and the message it conveys. This story starts from the day 7/11 when Mumbai serial blasts happened and ends after a week from that. The movie tells about the impact of the 7/11 bomb blasts on people's life, how it affected every character's life and finally how they manage to keep the 'Mumbai Spirit' alive. Excellent performances from Irfan Khan, KK, Soha Ali Khan, Paresh Rawal and Madhavan. A movie that truly deserves to be Tax-free and best movie of the year award. My personal second choice will be 'Aamir'. I salute the 'Mumbai Spirit'." 
" This movie comes from Bollywood..we are pleasantly surprised!!","I was apprehensive of watching this movie. I mean, I read that it got favorable reviews in newspapers et al, but still I had super commercial movies, like Singh is Kinng and Bachna ae Haseeno, still pending to see and here I am spending 210 bucks on a movie which might turn out to be an "art movie".But, voilà!! was I surprised!! Right from the first 15 minutes till the end (where Paresh Rawal delivers a stunning depiction of Mumbai-- mind it, stunning not because of the difficult usage of some flowery words, but stunning because of its simplicity), the movie completely had me mesmerized.Whether it is Kay Kay Menon's eccentric hatred towards minority or Soha's time to be on the receiving side of the table (watch out for the extremely satirical portrayal of our current TV News channels); whether it is Irrfan Khan's portrayal of an utterly poor person who is eyed with suspicion by everyone or whether it is Madhawan's shaking of ideals..the movie scores in every department. But, its Paresh Rawal (who after ages of getting mindless roles like Phir Hera Pheri et al) gets a worthy role where he effortlessly essays the "spirit of mumbai..Immune!!" The movie is real, genuine, honest, maybe slow (to let the events sink in), heart wrenching and a satire of our current thinking systems.Given 10/10 because coming something out of "Bollywood", it's commendable. An advice: Better send a movie like this to Oscars rather than sending a crap like Eklavya!" 
" Yeh hai brilliance.....Brilliance meri jaan","Nishikant Kamat, after watching his second film....... I would definitely suggest watching out for his films.....About this film, it is one of the most beautifully written film. And kudos to Nishikant for keeping it so simple yet making it so intense. None of the characters of this film would seem superficial. The writer/director has captured the elements of the society with so much sensitivity that you are touched by each and every one of them. He has shown so many complicated situations to portray that its not the people, its the situation that brings the worst in a person and then at the end all the comraderie patches all shaky spirits among people and this is what keeps Mumbai moving and also the movie..... Every scene, every character has a meaning, a message. Madhavan has excelled as ever, no questions about Irfan, K K Menon, Paresh rawal and Soha Ali khan..... All perfect portrayal..... Even the not so known actors have excelled...... It happens very rarely where each actor is part of one perfect product....... And I can without doubt say that this is surely one of them....... There are so many moments that will remain etched for a long long time........ My favorite scenes are when Paresh Rawal picks up KK Menon in his van. The fear in Madhavan's face when he has to take trains again...... Soha's interview....... KK Menon's last scene in the restaurant........ Irfan khan's flowers scene.........I can just keep writing and end up writing about all the scenes :)....... I will stop here though :) And to top it all the way the movie ends is so stylistically simple.... Again a perfect score...... Yeh hai Mumbai meri jaan....There are some disturbing scenes, obviously because it involves blasts.. So just be prepared....... But believe me the characters will move you more than that..........Even though the movie is Mumbai meri Jaan, it could apply to any city of any country. I wish this becomes an official Indian movie selection in all festivals. A must watch for everybody........" 
" It will form an emotional bond with Mumbai crowd","Lets get one thing straight.This movie is about terrorism...but it is not patriotic. In the second half it very subtly (without any heavy handed drama) points out that terrorism is a global threat, against which we have to stand united and also be ready to accept any collateral damage that is bound to come our way.The story consists of 5 mini sub-plots about how the "11 Jul 06 train Blasts" affected the lives of the key characters of the film.The strongest point of the story is the "Character Arc" it gives to each of the 6 key characters. Each character travels from one end of the spectrum to the other throughout the course of the movie, causing a substantial change in their personality and mentality.MUMBAI MERI JAAN touches your heart, without getting preachy and without displaying Bollywood's trademark animated jingoism. Certain scenes leave their mark even after you have exited the theater.Noteworthy are: The actual shot of the blast & the way numbers 7 & 11 are displayed on the screen. Soha's interview outside the hospital & the story made on her tragedy by a news channel. Irrfan's visit to Centre One mall. Kay Kay's "conversion" scene near the end. Madhavan's conversation with his friend about USA being "Safe". The finale of the movie & ALL SCENES FEATURING PARESH RAWAL.Relatively new director, Nishikant Kamat, extracts stellar performances from his cast. The critics will have a tough time choosing "Best Supporting Actors" nomination cause Irrfan, Kay Kay and R Madhavan have provided flawless performances. But one actor stands above all else, be it his jokes, or his advice to Kay Kay about trying to stop the "Chain", or his speech in the end. Paresh gives one of his best performances till date. His HAWALDAR TUKARAM PATIL will be remembered for decades to come just like his BABURAO APTE.Special mention for the dialogs of this movie... realistically penned they hit bulls eye, and you will find people cheering and clapping to most of them.Not that this movie is perfect, many questions are left unanswered. What happened to Kay Kay's money lender? What about Madhavan's wife? apart from these loose ends the movie also feels a bit long in certain sections where the story moves slowly. But all these flaws are minor.One of the best movie to come out in 2008, it might not have the same emotional impact on audiences of other cities. But it will form an emotional bond with Mumbai crowd. A must watch for all Mumbaikars." 
" A must watch for every mumbai-ite","A must watch for every mumbai-ite There have been many films portraying the undying nature of the people of mumbai. There was 'Life in a Metro' where the life-styles of people were shown. There was 'Taxi 9211' where it showed how a common man lived in mumbai. But this movie tops all.Stellar performances by Kay Kay Menon, Paresh Rawal and Irrfan as usual. Paresh as the aging cop shows the typical 'live-and-let-live' mentality of a mumbai-ite. But later realises how he could have bettered his life. Kay Kay Menon with the average ignorant Hindu who despises Muslims and how his impressions change due to events occurring in his life.All these events triggered by the mumbai serial train blasts. R.Madhavan depicts the regular mumbai train-traveler whose mind will always remember the incident but he would have to move on. That is what the fighting spirit of MUMBAI is all about. The never-say-die attitude! You have to salute the attitude." 
" Touching...","Mumbai, India is a tough place. Not only is it one of the largest cities in the world, but they've had a ton of terrorist killings there over the last couple decades. Three times in recent years they've had terrorist attacks in which 170 or more people were killed. This film is about one particular attack--the one in 2006 in which 209 were killed coordinated train bombings. You see not only some of the attack (which is VERY bloody, realistic and frightening), but how the attack affects a select group of disparate people. How these separate stories all work together remind me of a couple other exceptional films--"Traffic" and "Crash".One man normally rides in first class, but today he rides in second to discuss a business deal. The bomb detonates where he WOULD have sat and the bomb causes him to fall apart emotionally--which is certainly no surprise.A hot-shot female reporter makes a living out of exploiting others' pain. Early in the film, she even asks a woman, obviously in pain, how she feels!! Well, this ends up biting her back, as her fiancé is one of the men killed--and soon her coworkers are pecking at her like vultures on a fresh corpse! A Hindu man is mad. He hates Muslims and KNOWS these two guys he often sees are among those responsible for the bombings. There is no logic to this, as the city's largest minority is Muslim and surely he can't KNOW--but he's angry and looking for revenge.The local police are disliked and known for their corruption. One of them in particular, a man about to retire, is having doubts about his career and how the force treats folks--innocent or not.While at first it seems to have nothing to do with the bombings, a man is with his family when he is, rather nastily, tossed out of the mall. He's mad...and wants to hurt these people. So, he calls in a bomb threat soon after the terrorist attacks--and panic grips the patrons at the mall. One has a heart attack in the scurry to exit the place--and the crank caller cannot live with the guilt.It is very surprising that given the prevalence of terrorism and the sheer numbers of folks impacted by it that so few films have been made which address this. I also was pleasantly surprised to see the film connect the Mumbai killings with the 9/11 massacre in New York. After all, the message is that we are all in this together! All in all, an exceptional film that I give kudos for many reasons. It's brave and very insightful--and is very well written and acted. In particular, several times you see actors playing VERY tough scenes--with lots of tough emotional scenes--very, very tough ones. And, bringing all these story elements together was not easy--the director did a nice job eliciting great performances AND keeping it all coherent and compelling. This is one of the better Indian films I have seen and recommend it wholeheartedly. Not your typical Bollywood picture."
