" The film is average for a newbie,","Well the film was comedy,it has it.If you want entertainment than it should be watched. dev goel is also a writer ,well he didn't write this film story ,Writing in a film and acting in a film is a much part ways.I didn't watch bird idol so i Can't say whether he is a good writer or not .But it is almost impossible that a person can master writing and acting at a same time.His acting was good if we see him as a writer ,but it isn't excellent.We can say that he overacted a little ,but I can say that his acting career is just started ,he might become good to be praised as a comedy sweet actor.but it take time and rehearsing the dialogues.I also watched nasser khan Shadow ,the film which released in 2009 .nasser was its producer and writer at the same time ,I praise his dare ,as he was blind in reality,but not his work .Till now this is worst movie I had seen ,specially his way of speaking of nasser khan ,as compared to Hum hain Rahi car ke .this film is nothing as both have newbie lead actors. The best thing of this film is due to its songs ,but its credits goes to their singers ,specially I liked ding dang ding dang."
