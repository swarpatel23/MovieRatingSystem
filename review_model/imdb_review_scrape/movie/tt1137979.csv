" Decent Movie !","Yes ! The movie had a couple of plots which were not needed but over all it was not a bore at all , infact I enjoyed it as well . Rajpal is truly is a gifted actor to the Bollywood industry" 
" Rajpal Yadav is delightful!","'Rama Rama Kya Hai Dramaaa' is a mediocre comedy, that merits a watch due to Rajpal Yadav's delightful performance.'Rama Rama Kya Hai Dramaaa' Synopsis: Two bank employees face problems after marrying two very attractive women.Chandrakant Singh's Direction is ordinary. The Screenplay is funny in bits. Cinematography & Editing are standard.Performance-Wise: Rajpal truly does wonders. He's funny, likable & memorable. Neha Dhupia is average. Ashish tries to raise laughs. Amrita Arora is fair. Anupam Kher & Rati Agnihotri are superb. Razzaq Khan & Deepak Shirke score, as well.On the whole, 'Rama Rama Kya Hai Dramaaa' works due to Rajpal Yadav." 
" Cant' get any worse !!!","Some movies should never be made...RRKHD surely belongs to this category. Although a novel plot , husband/wife relationships, it is let down by a insipid screenplay, total absence of story, and over the top acting. A seasoned comedian like Rajpal Yadav is totally wasted. I really don't know why Anupam Kher accepts scripts like these. For the rest of the cast , Amrita Arora is irritating, Aashish Chowdhary lacks any acting talent. Neha Dhupia , although the lead star, has hardly any lines to speak.. The only saving grace in the whole movie are some of the songs sung by Adnam Sami...Overall, You should only watch this at ur own peril !!!!" 
" Rama Rama synopsis","Rama Rama Kya Hai Dramaaa follows the rules and guidelines of Comedies. Although the topic it touches is serious in nature, director S. Chandrakant weaves humor in the plot so that the goings-on don't get heavy at any point.The story of Rama Rama Kya Hai Dramaaa revolves around three married couples -- Prem and Khushi, Santosh and Shanti and Mr. and Mrs. Khurana. Santosh marries Shanti, a small-town girl, and later realizes that Shanti is not the 'perfect wife'. Petty differences start popping up and Santosh starts day-dreaming and imaging other women as his wives. The marriage of Prem and Khushi is also not smooth-sailing, since Khushi is too demanding as a wife.Prem and Khushi and Santosh and Shanti start living separately.Later on lot of incidents occur in their respective lives and they realize the importance and value of their wives is what the story of the film is all about.On the whole, Rama Rama Kya Hai Dramaaa is a fair entertainer.You continue to smile, not squirm, as the reels unfold!"
