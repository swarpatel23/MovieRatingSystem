" One time watch for sure","I almost missed this movie, if it wasn't for Netflix I would have never watched this movie because of the negative reviews. I can't believe a crap movie like Dhoom 3 got 5.4 IMDb rating and this movie got 3.6, it should have been the other way around. While this movie is not a masterpiece, it does have some good moments and keeps you glued to the screen. Not for a moment I felt like turning off the TV or fast forward the scenes. Everyone have their choice, but I guess the lesson is do not go just by the IMDb ratings of the movie." 
" Warning ! Extreme torture !","It'll torture you more than the film SAW Does..! Actually there is nothing positive in this movie.Very poor script and irritating duologue's and extreme torture what they called comedy..!The story tells about a detective who has to solve a case for pride and become a good detective like his father.Arshad Warsi Done what he can with the poor script.The movie trying to laugh the people but unfortunately nothing actually workout.Soha Ali Khan Actually has to be praised.She done something special for this movie.But i think its not the right movie for her."Dabangg Girl" Also Done an item dance and also done her first Bikini avatar.But everyone forgot about acting..! Anyway If you worth your money avoid it." 
" A wacky comedy which will be trashed by many but also liked by a few.","Looking at the tricky title, the first thought which comes to the mind is that this must be another vulgar comedy relying on all cheap tricks to win over the viewers. Thankfully MR. JOE B. CARVALHO is not one of those sex based comedies made with a specific motive, but at the same time it is also not a thoroughly enjoyable comedy giving you a good time in the theater in return of your ticket money spent. The film actually relies on all weird and wacky kind of humour which mostly fails post intermission due to lack of any novel content and enjoyable sequences written in its weak script.It begins interestingly resembling the famous Mr. Bean's (Rowan Atkinson) Detective movies, but then fast loses track with all forced in songs and absurd progression without having anything substantial to serve to the audience. Debut director Samir Tewari tries too hard to create the much required humour, even in the song lyrics which falls flat when too many songs are thrown in to hinder its overall pace. The second half further ruins the movie as compared to the first and the climax is a complete clich√©d one wherein again everyone reaches one common place to fight each other. At times Arshad Warsi does make you laugh with his superb comic timing & funny dialogues. But then with no great supportive acts he also remains quite helpless despite having the likes of Jaaved Jaaferi who is not given any great sequence to perform. Soha Ali Khan is just OK, doing some skin show too playing the Dabangg style cop and both Geeta Basra and Karishma Kotak strictly remain average. The group of fine comic actors like Vijay Raaz, Vrajesh Hirjee, Manoj Joshi, Snehal Dabhi & Virendra Saxena are also not able to deliver the expected. Plus both Ranjeet and Shakti Kapoor are just there to add up to the names. Himani Shivpuri does an over the top act playing Arshad's mother and I really wondered what Babul Supriyo (singer) was doing in the film playing that childish cameo (and also Kunal Khemu in just a few frames).Along with the actors both Cinematography & Background Score too remain the victim of a bad script but the writers surely could have done much better job as they did show their sparks at various occasions. Actually the film does have its moments with few timely witty one liners generating some good laughs but the overall wackiness of its narrative is not going to have many takers. Yes, such kind of humour does have its own small audience but they are also the ones who actually would enjoy it more on the smaller screen without spending any extra money on the costly theaters tickets.So in possibilities such films might have a good run in the home video market and you may not mind watching MR. JOE B. CARVALHO as a light fun comedy coming on a cable channel in the next few months (at no additional cost). But in the theaters it is sure going to find it tough as the film will be trashed by many and enjoyed by only a few." 
" Worst movie of Arshad Warsi !!","I didn't like the movie at all. This is the worst movie of Arshad Warsi, I've ever seen. Maybe he should try to avoid these kind of movie and especially when he is going solo. The script and dialogues are very torturing. Songs are placed in random order with no prior thoughts given to them. It can be easily seen that no effort has been put into this movie to make this standing aside from other bollywood masala movies. Arshad Warsi, Soha ali Khan and Javed Jaafri has done a fine work. But the movie couldn't stand the expectations. Arshad warshi could have been made more like detective. Script writer could have made it more interesting by adding extra thoughts on dialogues, comedy scenes, humorous jokes rather than forcing viewers to laugh."
