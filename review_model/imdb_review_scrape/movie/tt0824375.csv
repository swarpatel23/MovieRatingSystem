" Excellent! Ignore the critics, this one is worth a watch.","I wish there were more movies like this made in Bollywood instead of the family dramas with unrealistic romantic sequences and the predictable happy endings. Without a doubt the best RGV movie I have seen since Rangeela. Amitabh was perfect as a 60yo Vijay, married and bogged down by the monotony of life, yet living what appears to be a "happy" married life with "no complaints". Jiah Khan is also excellent as Jia, especially given that this is her first movie. In keeping with the tone of the movie there are no songs/dance sequences (thank god for that!). RGV has chosen a very talented bunch of actors, they all excel at their roles, there is no melodrama that is typically associated with scenes regarding infidelity etc., emotions are shown in a much more subtle fashion. Well done RGV!" 
" Awesome!!!","This movie is art in its pure form. Right from the very beginning when the protagonist is shown you will sit and watch throughout if you are an actual film-lover because it contains all aspects of film-making in its true sense: whether you take its background-score or its photography or its dialogues, everything is set to perfection. The movie does progresses a bit slow but it couldn't have been faster as well. Ram Gopal Verma has proved how he can bring the best out of his actors by never making us feel an inch about Jiah Khan's debut in the same movie. This movie did create controversies as being the wrong trend-setter for the coming generations when the people should have noticed the strong flavor of reality of life shown in the movie with very supported justifying dialogues for every portrayal of so called 'against culture'. This is film-making at its best." 
" The sum of parts is less than the whole",""Nishabd" strictly speaking could have translated into the missing link between "Lolita" and "Cheeni Kum". RGV toyed with the media in an attempt to garner free publicity. The provoked media in turn added fuel to the fire. And finally the audience oscillated between speculation and fantasising. "Nishabd" as it finally turned out to be wasn't anything RGV/ media/ audience wanted. "Nishabd" is a visual treat, you will fall in love with nature. Kudos to Amit Roy showcasing his talent of holding the camera. The background score is engaging. The single song Big B sings is good to listen thought doesn't blend in with the storyline. Technically the movie is brilliant. Every actor gives a calibrated performance. The audience gets an opportunity to see the subtlety which Big B manages to portray on the screen. There are many scenes as per the the conventional Bollywood rules could have dictated to be made as over-the-top. But RGV breaks away from the norm and makes it surreal. Sadly all the goodness fails to make it a wholesome product. "Nishabd" is good in parts and at a few places it does not integrate with the spinal cord. Better writing and screenplay was warranted to convincingly flesh out the attraction between the pair in question. The audience had a serious disconnect on this front. Jiah Khan's character wasn't fleshed out adequately especially attempting to portray a product from a broken family goes astray on moral front. On the same note the character of the rest of the cast namely Revati, Shraddha, Nasser & Aftab are well written.When a man falls in love with a girl of twenty, it isn't her youth he is seeking but his own. ~Lenore Coffee" 
" Take Light","The story is very simple about a love between a 60-year old man and an 18-year old girl but was told in a very stylish format. The aqua blue cinematography was excellent that really did suited the mood for the film and it's similar to Zinda. Jiah Khan's acting was quite good for her first film. I really liked her voice and it was a good idea that she had to speak a lot of English throughout the whole film because she was from Australia and it made her look foreign. Amitabh Bachchan is simply the best actor in Bollywood and he took care of the whole film. Nishabd was so much based on reality and it's true that most woman like older men & older men like younger women although there was a 42-year age difference between them. The best thing about the movie is that they didn't fall in love on first sight. Vijay (Amitabh) took Jiah out because his daughter was injured and couldn't make it. They both had a good time and slowly they fell in love which was much more sensible. The best scene is when Jiah was soaking herself with the water hose & Vijay was taking pictures of her. Music is also good although there are only two songs and they are not in the film but there are CDs & tapes. Rozana is a terrific song & Take light is also good but Rozana is one of the best songs of 2007." 
" Nishabd is Varma's conscious attempt to avoid clichés and stereotypes.","In director Ram Gopal Varma's Nishabd,newcomer Jiah Khan plays an 18-year-old temptress who initiates and entices her classmate's 60-year-old father into a complex, inexplicable relationship while she's staying with the family at their hill-station home one summer. Amitabh Bachchan plays the man in question, who finds himself falling for this brash, spoilt teenager who's showering him with the kind of attention he hasn't experienced before. Despite working off a script that borrows generously from the Drew Barrymore thriller Poison Ivy, Ram Gopal Varma makes it very clear he's back in form as he sinks his teeth into what is perhaps his first all-out emotional, character drama. Varma casts a mood of gloominess, a sense of impending doom all over this film, which is reminiscent of the manner in which he'd treated Bhoot. What I like about Nishabd is Varma's conscious attempt to avoid clichés and stereotypes. The affair takes place not sneakily and surreptitiously, but right under the nose of Bachchan's wife and daughter who are just too naïve to read all the signs. When the affair is finally discovered, there's none of that typical filmi-style screaming and shouting, instead Varma treats the moment realistically using shock and silence to convey the sense of feeling betrayed.Admirably, the director's decided not to spoon-feed his audience by explaining every character's every motivation. While it's more or less clear why Jiah falls for Bachchan, you are yourself expected to interpret his reason for responding to her affections. It could be the thrill of physical intimacy to a nubile, young girl. It could stem from a sense of responsibility he feels towards her. It could be a momentary lapse of judgement on his part, or then the result of suppressed apathy he feels towards his frumpy wife. I suspect it's everything put together. Because much of Nishabd is shot in real time - the entire second half to be specific - it does seem too long and too stretched out, especially since there isn't very much happening. But don't be fooled, that's exactly the mood Varma's going for. Remember, Nishabd is essentially about loneliness, and this leisurely pace that Varma creates for the film only contributes to that feeling of loneliness.I suspect most people, women particularly are going to have a problem with the film's ending. As much as I'd like to elaborate, I won't because saying any more here will give away too much. I must confess I had a problem with the film's ending myself, but for another reason completely - I feel it's a cop-out. A compromise ending to a bold, brave story. I could have predicted the ending, and it's no fun when that happens. How I wish Varma had pushed the envelope all the way and gone with a truly bold ending that us regular Hindi-film junkies would never have predicted and would have been totally surprised by! For the most part, Nishabd is watchable because it's held together by a truly awe-inspiring performance by Amitabh Bachchan. Unlike other clearly defined roles that are like a road map for actors while constructing their performance, his role in Nishabd is one that has no reference point. It's a performance that Bachchan creates out of thin air, based on his own understanding of the character. Remember the toughest roles to play are the ones that are too simple, too normal. It's not easy playing an average joe, but Bachchan does it marvelously. Watch him in the scene where he breaks into a laugh in the middle of the night, or watch him in that pre-intermission scene where Jiah confronts him with her feelings, or even that scene where he's singing to himself much to his wife's surprise -- everything from his expressions, his dialogue delivery, even the movement of his eyes! It's difficult to imagine any other actor doing justice to a part so simple and therefore so difficult to play. His co-star Jiah Khan is perfectly cast as the troubled girl who's very aware of her effect on this man. Wearing her sexuality on her sleeve, Jiah sashays in and out of scenes, showing so much thigh, you feel like you're in a mutton shop. Also is it just me or did you also notice that Jiah seems to be suffering from a Sharon Stone complex, she's constantly uncrossing her legs -- when she's standing, when she's sitting, when she's lying around on the floor -- everywhere. I don't think there's a single scene in the film where she's got her legs together. All said and considered, Nishabd is bold even though it doesn't overstep the invisible moral line. It is, nonetheless, an experiment on Varma's part because it's unconventional in every sense - the narrative is not linear, the pace is leisurely and the plot itself is brave. For these reasons I suspect there will be many who will not embrace it. Which is fine. It makes you uncomfortable and shifty and even restless at times. It's everything that makes for a good character study. Give it a try." 
" Interesting, but not bold enough","In my opinion, Nishabd is a fairly well-made film. RGV tackles an unconventional theme - I won't call it bold, at least not bold enough - with remarkable ease. The director uses his signature style of very tight close-ups to great effect. Of course, the camera cannot enter the minds of the characters, but it comes very close. Through every minute expression, every twitch of the facial muscles, it shows you what the characters are thinking and feeling. And if you have an actor like Amitabh Bachchan, that only heightens the impact.The absence of a plot actually works to the film's advantage. The film moves forth in a languorous fashion, which can be irritating to some viewers, but for me it worked well. It gave me all the time to witness and reflect upon the events as they lazily unfolded themselves. It gave me the time to savour the subtle directorial touches.Yes, it also gave me enough opportunity to think about what could have been done differently. But that's precisely what I expect from a fulfilling movie-going experience - an opportunity to watch a movie at an emotional as well as a rational level: from the heart as well as the head.The director opts for blue as the predominant color in the palette he uses to paint his vision of a May-November romance between his lead characters Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) and Jiah (Jiah Khan). Each and every scene, even when it captures the breathtakingly beautiful and lush locales of Munnar, is bathed in a blue hue. Now that's an interesting color for a tale like this.At the most obvious level, blue stands for romance and in that respect seems completely harmonious with the theme. If we really get into various kinds of symbolisms, blue also stands for virtues like truth, honesty and fidelity. And that's a delightful contrast from what we see in the relationship between Vijay and Amrita (Revathy). I can't say what RGV's real idea behind using this colour was, maybe I'm seeing too much into a device used merely to present a pretty picture, but to me it opens up a number of interesting possibilities.Interestingly, elements of incongruity crop up in other areas as well - whether it's the quirky camera movement or the very out-of-character background music. While the story itself moves at a leisurely pace, the camera moves all over the place almost in an intrusive fashion. Ditto for the brilliant background music by Amar Mohile - the hammering, thriller-like background score is in perpetual conflict with the sensitivity of romance on the screen.I don't take these incongruities as faults, though I must admit they were quite distracting at times. I thought that the very fact that they were in stark contrast with the film itself was an interesting way to depict the inner conflict of the characters. Rules of conventional film-making would say that the camera movements and music should be in tune with what's being depicted on film, but when has RGV followed rules or conventions? Now for the compromises - RGV clearly shies away from including any sexual angle to this unusual love story. Given the way the unashamedly voyeuristic camera (and to an extent the writing) has a field day presenting Jiah Khan as a sex object - the extra-short dresses, the wet scene (ah, this predilection of Hindi commercial filmmakers for showing heroines getting wet in a white saree!! Only, the white saree gets replace by a white shirt worn over an almost non existent pair of shorts), over-emphasis on showing her naked legs, and Jiah Khan's defiantly sexual demeanour - it is certain that the director had all the intentions of showing lust as the trigger for the relationship, but probably had to compromise on that aspect because of the demigod status of his lead actor.This is one area where the disconnect between the technique and the content works to the film's detriment. The story would have been much more interesting and realistic if this aspect had been adequately explored. Much as I am in absolute awe of Amitabh Bachchan and think that his performance in Nishabd is one of his finest, I can't help admitting that his presence in the film dilutes the impact of the film. RGV clearly develops cold feet and refrains from adding any dirty thoughts into his male protagonist's mind; yet his camera is not quite convinced and continues to explore the baser emotions.The other big compromise that RGV had to make also stems from trying to show Vijay in a more favorable light. There was no reason to add that monologue justifying/ rationalizing the attraction between a 60 year old man and an 18 year old kid - "an old man gets attracted to a young girl because he wants to hold on to his youth" - Phew!. I strongly believe that love, even when it is triggered by lust, does not always have a straight-forward reason, but is in fact a very complex psychological thing that cannot always be rationalized.It is here that you just can't help thinking that the film definitely needed to take its title seriously: some things are better left unsaid - Nishabd." 
" The Glorious Journey of "Vijay" Reaches to a New Climax !","First off, I must refer to the beautiful efforts from the director side. (Ram Gopal Varma) is definitely the main star here. The direction made one great personality for the movie. I was so happy that finally the new Indian cinema could create something this aesthetic, different, and deep. Not to mention being watchable in the same time, and out of the forever-and-ever learned-by-heart old formula (with the endless needless songs, numbers, etc).I believe it's a dream for any director to make what (Ram Gopal Varma) did, a remake of (Lolita), and with the performance of Mr. (Bachchan) himself; albeit it's a bit late for him to make such a sane movie with pure sensitive drama like this. Since long time, I hoped for somebody, including (Bachchan) himself, who would pay heed to never-seen talents in an actor named (Amitabh Bachchan).The big B proves simply that he's a genius performer, returning us to that actor inside of this mega-star. We got the chance to see this actor few times during a long journey with mostly commercial movies. So I see that the bold move to make (Nishabd) was more important than many movies that (Bachchan) made before already.In Nishabd (means "Wordless" in English), we watch another (Lolita) story, where it's interestingly platonic this time more than sexual. The narration's stops were used in a very good way, it was thrilling and with (Bachchan)'s baritone voice it gained a marvelous feel. But still the best about this script is its ending. It's a rare moment that nobody was interested in before. The lead simply lost the wife, the mistress, and the daughter; or lost himself, his very existence, while he's incapable of committing suicide as well, so he became totally frozen, living the death literally. It's maybe the most significant finale in all of (Bachchan)'s movies yet, and all of (Lolita)'s movies too.Though the movie didn't convince me how this photographer was that rich who lives a wealthy lifestyle, to the extent of having all of these farms, this lake, and this mountain beside the lake! It seemed odd that just a "photographer" could own all of this. Also, I couldn't catch on how the daughter knew about the relationship. And the movie overlooked going into the wife's character. Nevertheless, the real criticism will go surely to the third act, where the lead suddenly surrenders to the idea of refusing the girl, and forcing her to leave, right after the appearing of her friend; this situation was strange, and not understandable.The cinematography excelled in giving us a blue cold world, which was nothing but Vijay's world. The feel of deceiving hotness is so clever since the image is capturing the sense of wintertime (aka: the lead's midlife crises). The intent to present the whole movie between white, black, and blue is just a hint to us that this story takes place under bank of powerful mist that led this old man to a point which blinded him to see his oldness and his family.What I didn't like about the direction was the exaggerated focusing on this (Lolita)'s body. It was clear from the start that the movie chose not relying on the sexual side, so using these shots was somehow unnecessary. And with plenty of them, you have to feel the boredom occasionally.(Jiah Khan) delivered a highly solid performance. She ranged smartly between being a naughty child at times, and a lost teenager at others.The Big B was "Vijay" for the first time in his early breakthrough (Zanjeer - 1973) as "Insp. Vijay Khanna". I think he loved the name, and saw a good omen in it. Strangely it happened to be a good omen indeed. He was "Vijay" later in so many memorable hits: (Deewaar - 1975), (Don - 1978), (Trishul - 1978), (Kaala Patthar - 1979), (Dostana - 1980), (Shaan - 1980), (Shakti - 1982), (Aakhree Raasta - 1986), (Shahenshah - 1988), (Agneepath - 1990). And now he's "Vijay" again yet in nothing like any action, melodrama, comedy, musical, or Masala (the Indian mix of all of that together) that he has done before, advancing in great strides, and assuring that this Vijay can make everything.(Nishabd) is distinct experience for the Indian cinema, (Amitabh Bachchan), and us that succeeded in being an interesting film, and being the 2 together "Interesting" and "Film" is quite rare for any cinema, not to mention the Indian cinema.To all the makers of this: we need more." 
" Little bold and a bit beautiful","I tried to watch this movie keeping "Lolita" and "poison ivy" out of mind. After all, the 'old man falling for a young girl' is not new in Hollywood by any stretch of imagination. This movie is purely for Indian audiences, many of whom may have never seen "Lolita", and therefore its purpose is to introduce an 'alien' subject to bollywood. So far, so good!!Nishabd starts well. A young girl Jiah captures her friend's father's heart by being unusually carefree and unbelievably audacious. While her 'take light' attitude is conveniently attributed to her Australian upbringing and a troubled childhood, the scenes showing Amitabh's growing attraction towards her are well presented. Here, i must mention the young actress Jiah Khan. She fits the part completely- physically and phonetically. Using her extra-provocative body language and always-uncrossed legs, she brings to life a manipulative and headstrong young girl with a selfish motive of enticing an old man. Amitabh is reliable, though monotonous, and speaks volumes through his eyes.Jiah's and amitabh's growing infatuation for each other is pasted against picturesque backdrops of Munnar (kerala) and up to the interval, the movie is very much watchable ( sometimes, entertaining). As traces of sexual tension are clearly visible and the affair being still a secret form the household, you anticipate a path breaking second-half. This is where things go wrong. By the time jiah and amitabh confront each other with their feelings, the bollywood's morality fever has returned. Nishabd makes the elementary and hackneyed mistake of grouping love and lust in the same bracket. The way the first half is shown, the only conclusion you can draw is that both the protagonists are sexually attracted to each other. Yet, the director identifies these lustful feelings as love and leaves you confused. This is, undoubtedly, done because it would have been difficult to convince the Indian people that the base of an unconventional relationship is lust, not love. Since 'love conquers all' and is much 'purer' and acceptable than lust, people must respect it. For, however important age difference is, love is love and it is OK if it happens to anyone, isn't it? As a reviewer rightly put: "This movie fits the moral envelope, but it never tries to push it." THe movie makes a brilliant point about how an old man's impending death can lead him to unexperienced joys in the world like young bodies, yet it fails to recognize the relationship as raw infatuation. I can understand how important it is for the movie's commercial success to call lust as love, but i expected RGV to be bolder and give us a more radical story.Nishabd is still not a total disappointment. The photography is beautiful and you can't help but want to visit munnar after watching. The acting is top-notch and Jiah khan is certainly a find. But, above all, nishabd is the latest in the series of bollywood films this year that have gradually taken us toward more relevant and intelligent cinema. Nishabd deserves credit for addressing a bold issue and on the whole, for being a part of bollywood revolution towards better films, though we haven't reached there yet." 
" Not Lolita, and not bad either.","I've been saying that I'd like to see Amitabh Bachchan in a role where he is vulnerable and confused, instead of being the wisdom figure he's been stuck in in too many roles by now, and Ram Gopal Varma has granted my wish. This movie mostly succeeds in creating complex, believable, and interesting major characters, and I'd say the overall story is a good one, even including the ending which a few of the few reviews I've read weren't satisfied with. It did not disappoint me psychologically.I am glad someone has given AB a role like this, and hope it's the first of many. I feel sure he's happy about it himself, as I've heard him talk a bit ruefully about all the father/patriarchs he gets called to do. This is a real acting job, the creation of an individual character, with the camera almost always on his face, photographed in a naturalistic way that gives us his age, his true skin color, and his sad-eyed good looks. We also see a lot of his hands, and I think it's intentional - a constant reminder of his age, as they show it the most, especially as RGV photographs them.It's not Lolita (so many people seem to say it is), but the 18-year-old girl Vijay, AB's 60 year old character, falls in love with is neither mature nor well put together, either.When we first meet her, with her abundant beauty and lovely body, and her crass behavior and flauntiness, I worried that RGV was going to be trying to sell me this package of annoyances as purely lovable and "sassy." But I ended up feeling that she was very well-drawn and that he knew what he was doing: you can see her through the eyes of Vijay, whose need for something seems to be met in her youth, beauty, and liveliness - but Varma also shows her to you through the eyes of "some other adult" -- a grown woman (me, say), a man who's immune to her, etc. She is pretty and sexy-acting, has some idea of her sexual power and tries to use it, but she is also unquestionably a psychological mess, a mixed-up little girl who displays and provokes. A stroke or two of background info, not made much of, grounds a perception of somebody whose needs are all over the place.She's come to visit from Australia. Her skimpy, sexy outfits -- shorts, tiny skirts, and the like -- are nothing that would be at all unusual in any western country during hot weather, and the Indian family she's visiting doesn't pay attention to them either. Somebody just looking at her body, as the camera often does (but not vulgarly, I'd say) might be captivated by "sex appeal," but anyone paying attention to her behavior -- for example, tickling Amitabh's foot with her own foot at the dinner table, with her friend and the mom present, or running off with the camera he is teaching her to operate, dropping it, and being petulant rather than apologetic -- anybody attending to all that sees a loose cannon.The movie is a lot of close-ups and a lot of photography of the tea plantation where the family lives, all shot so it looks a dull green all the time. The holding of the tonality so even allows, I think, for our sustained focus on the emotional developments. Also, the story is squarely about Vijay, and he lives in a place that is like this, relatively muted.I don't think I felt Vijay's "happiness" as much as recognizing it, and that may be a weakness of the performance. I have always found AB a great silent broadcaster of the emotions like sadness, regret, deep concern, and those gifts of his are well-used here. I liked the performance of Revathi as his wife, who conveyed calm, intelligent, mature contentment with her family and life." 
" Masterpiece","Damn the convention. And damn the cheesy, escapist cinema of Bollywood in which heroes deliver lofty dialogues and talk of ideals that sound good only on the screen and not in real life. Ram Gopal Varma's film 'Nishabd', with all its strength and shortcomings, is a piece of quality cinema that talks openly and unabashedly about things and emotions that many would prefer to be swept under the carpet.You can make a technically topnotch film, but what's the point if it has a fragile soul. 'Nishabd' has a soul, and a soul that cannot be spelt (pun intended). It has to be seen with an open frame of mind. Only then can one appreciate a film like 'Nishabd', despite some of its technical flaws. And  now coming to the main point  if you want to see Amitabh Bachchan the superactor, rather than the superstar, then 'Nishabd' is the film. 'Nishabd' is a film about loss: about loss of love and loss of purpose in life. It is about the inexplicable desire to reclaim youth when one is in the sunset of one's life. This is the rationale presented by the movie's 60-year-old protagonist while explaining his attraction towards a teenager. This attraction, though not uncommon, is seldom expressed in real life. And those who express it mostly end up like the protagonist of 'Nishabd'.The movie rests solely on the dependable shoulders of Amitabh Bachchan. If not for him, 'Nishabd' would have ended up as a mediocre product. It is a popular notion in Bollywood that acting is about speaking punchy dialogues, shedding tears, delivering monologues and giving intense facial expressions. Performances are often not distinguished from roles. If a role is strong, the performance (be it good or bad) automatically gets appreciated.Here, I want to draw a fine dividing line between Mr. Bachchan's role and performance. In 'Nishabd' he is not the typical hero. On the contrary, he plays a character who cannot resist the desire and temptation for a young girl. So the Bollywood convention would have him labeled a 'weak' character.This is where Mr. Bachchan's performance stands out. His dialogues in the film are pretty plain, but it is the way he delivers them that lends the impact. Many things about his character remain vocally unsaid, but it is his expressions and his glances that make them explicit. Mr. Bachchan even speaks through his silences in the film. He brings out the inner conflict of his character in his body language, his eyes and his expressions. In a nutshell, it is a performance worth saluting.Jiah Khan is perfectly suited to her role of a girl quite careless about the way she is dressed. There is a sexual undertone to her character in the film and her performance of it is not bad for a first timer.Revathy's acting is natural. Nasser (as her brother in the film) is effective. 'Nishabd' goes to prove that Ram Gopal Varma has not lost his magic touch. The maverick filmmaker is truly the master of his craft. From the opening reels to the conclusion, Varma unspools the story at a rhythmic pace. The cinematography and the camera angles are superb. The editing, though jerky at times, is slick. And never does the elegance of form overpower the movie's main content.For all the lovers of good quality cinema, 'Nishabd' is strongly recommended. The film has a riveting plot and Mr. Bachchan at his best.To hell with convention. I like to give this movie 10 out of 10. SIMPLY A MASTERPIECE." 
" Story OK... Treatment....err...","There is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it.But. They did it subtly. They did not make it so apparent from the start that the director is gearing them up to make them fall in love with each other. Not as naturally as two people would (Age no bar) but forcing them to be around each other as if they were SUPPOSED to fall in love.All in all, there should have been chemistry. It would have solved the biggest problem. People with reservations against the subject would also have been engrossed and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, no matter the impracticality.I found it difficult to believe Jia's character at times. What I found more difficult to understand, is why Vijay - a photographer and an artist, who seems serious - would have had an interest in a girl so frivolous. Unless he himself has some frivolousness hidden in himself, which did not come out at all.There is a lot of use of Dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is generally used to show something unnatural or something that might lead to something that is not right. So RGV is himself calling the relationship unnatural.The camera angles, background score, editing, and even the juxtaposition of shots and symbology emphasises and overemphasises their relationship. Is the Indian audience so dumb that we need to be told something in 10 different ways for us to understand? Especially when the two of them were dancing together... it was apparent what was happening. What was the need of slowing the scene down with dramatic background music? I feel the subject was very well chosen. But Verma should not have made the film with the fact in mind constantly that this is a controversial subject. If it is, then handle it delicately, why don't you?" 
" Go Speechless (nishabd) with the "Indian Beauty"","It is tough to ignore the genius of the man called "Amitabh Bachchan". He has done such breakthrough movies after his comeback, its difficult to judge which Bachchan era was better.Gia is the non-typical daughter's friend who comes to stay with the settled family in the hills of darjeeling (or a similar location). Showing the typical mannerisms of a brat, she slowly starts capturing the attention of the man of the house, and rest follows....Since the movie has released just yesterday, it would be sacrilege to divulge what happens afterwards, but what is important to know is that Mr. Bachchan gives yet another powerhouse performance. I thought Black/Sarkaar could not be bettered, but just go watch a few scenes in the movie to get awed again by the man.Gia debuts wonderfully by doing ample justice to her role (with the same name). It was always a role meant for a fresh face, and she does a fine job at that. It is obvious that the girl is confident with her body, coz she uses it well to show the innocence topped with a lot of sensuality.Revathi dons the mantle of the wife, and I just get the feeling that she is a wasted talent in the whole cast. Her brilliance shines in a few parts but thats all she has in the whole movie.Ritu (the daughter.. think her real name is Shraddha?)..has a little sobbing to do at the end, and again thats where she does justice to her being cast.So does it look like I came out from the movie impressed? Yes, thats true. But as rightly pointed out by some critics, 'Indianising' the movie might have stopped this one from taking a cult status. By steering clear of the potential 'sexuality' and focusing on the 'love', it might have robbed the movie off some of its shine. This might not be an 'Amercian Beauty' but Nishabd sure proves to be an Indian Beauty." 
" A masterpiece in its own way","Nishabd is a masterpiece in its own way. Due to its unconventional theme was slammed by the audience but as a film, it stands on strong ground. Mature, sensitive and sensible. A love story shown realistically with all restrictions thrown right at your face. Only a mature film-goer will accept this film. Splendid cinematography-The close-ups are magnificent. The way the camera captures each and every expression of the lead actors needs to be given standing ovations.Same goes for the Background score-brilliant. One of the best I have heard in many years. Performances-Newcomers Jia and Shraddha deliver superb performances and so does Revathy. Amitabh-what can I say about this man? I am out of words because whatever I say will not be sufficient to describe this one. Is this a performance?? I felt he was living he character. I haven't seen him perform so realistically before. He has always been realistic but Nishabd I feel saw the best in him.the darker parts of his personality. Is there anything he cant do? This has to be Big b's finest performance to date-AB fans don't miss this!I AM LITERALLY NISHABD(Nuff said)Verma's take on fluctuations of human mind and unspoken relationships should not be missed." 
" I Have Iiked him in a lot of other movies more.","This movie did not give Mr. Bachchan justice. He is a great actor and I was very disappointed in the movie and there was not much plot to it. Matter a fact this is the first movie I have ever been disappointed in with him in it. It starts out with her coming to his home with his daughter and he is a photographer. He takes pictures of her in the garden has she's hosing herself down. He is a sixty year old man that has nothing to do but to take pictures of this girl. The movie makes no sense. The whole movie is about her chasing him around and her telling him how much she cares about him. Then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around places so she is not bored and is daughter finds out. I just didn't think this movie was up to Bachchan's standards. He is better than this movie. I always pictured him as an upstanding person and then I seen him in this movie and I couldn't picture him in this movie. The movie didn't hold my interest at all. I couldn't wait until the movie was over. And you won't either." 
" A delicacy that Bollywood rarely offers.","Another (obviously 'great') movie rolls out of the RGV factory. Loaded as it is with stardom of Bollywood's one man army  Amitabh Bachan, there can hardly be any doubts about performance. But when this superb performance is backed by some great direction to portray a bold script and finally edited by a master's scissor, what one has is a delicacy that Bollywood rarely offers.The plot is simple as the promos say, "he is 60, and she is 18... Some love stories are never meant to be understood". The movie is totally focused to this one single story and hence there is no time for non-sense - no songs or extras for comedy.The director has made the script sail very smoothly and naturally. From the beginning to the end the movie sticks to the reality criteria. Cinematography is simply superb. Camera movements are at their best as it is generally with Ram Gopal's movies. The use of colors is excellent. Background music again has played a very important role and it has been used very beautifully enhancing the impact of the script. There are many long silent moments in the movie, where music speaks everything.This is the first time I've seen Hindi words so beautifully used. Coming as it is from AB's mouth, it gets all the more impressive with his perfect pronunciations and inimitable voice. Besides his voice, his facial expressions are a treat and one realizes how much he can actually say without speaking. The same though cannot be said about Jiah Khan who debuts in this movie. Her role luckily is that of a girl who has had very disturbed upbringing and so her behavior is supposed to be kind of confusing and irritating, for which it seems she didn't have to act much. On the other hand Revathi has acted very well and has done full justice to her role as a house-wife.The movie concludes amazingly. It is one of the most striking parts of the movie, and goes well with the reality standards that film has adhered by throughout. It is simple and pragmatic, that real life is never glamorous where "they live happily thereafter". A perfect Ram Gopal Verma stuff. Recommended certainly!" 
" landmark of ramgopal vema","Life is not what you believe, what you expected; it's rather opposite. To live life should one rely on instincts or conscience? Instinct is pure natural & so without logic & conscience or morality is something acquired & accepted programming of mind- a part where right & wrong is justified. What happens when instinct collides with conscience in your choice, what choice you make? Sometimes vulnerability & passion of instinct can destroy all that you have built over the years. Love, when it comes, no matter how irrational, makes rationality take aback seat. An individual's emotions cannot be controlled by the expectations of society. What a brilliant message & what a brilliant made film by Ramgopal Verma. Watch this Ramgopal Verma film & it compels you to think hard once you complete it. Nishabd is a tragic story of a repenting man who listened to his natural instincts instead of moral side of conscience in a situation. It's out & out mature cinema & one of the most accomplished film from one of the finest film maker of current India - Ramgopal Verma. There are no words to express my gratitude towards Mr.Bachchan for this role, his intense acting & those countless million dollar expressions in this film. This is again most difficult role to gain audience sympathy & yes, he proved why still he is invincible in his acting & Baap of all. More than the scripted part of the film, I like the direct screen confessional narration of Amitabh which made the audience to get inside the skin of the character & made it more subjective rather than observe it from the objective point of view. Watch his crying confession in the last scene & tell me honestly is there any other Indian actor who can deliver such an intensity to the character as him!!! He is not playing character, he be the one. Jiah is novice in acting as it's her debut movie & she's gave noticeable performance but more than her act it's her boldness of character which is such an infectious that anyone can carried away to her. It's her characteristic unpredictability of boldness & uncommonness (internally & externally) which really made me love to fantasize about a kind of girl I would love to meet. Revathi & Nasser are two mature actors of south Indian cinema & they have also played their parts with their natural flair. Ramu you made me really nishabd (speechless). This is again my second screening of the film. And the reason is the movie created the same strong impression in my mind during its 1st watch. I recommended it to one of my close my friend & said that in a situation like this I would also possible for me or for any mature man to get carried away by instinct. I gave him a VCD to watch it yesterday & he messed his review with his own moral codes & character analysis of the movie's protagonist. I don't feel sad because he messed his opinion but feel disturbed that he didn't get the point of the film or my opinion. Today I watched it 2nd time & I will still like to retain my statement on every account. Now again this sort of purely experimental movie (which is just a frame of reference) is only a director & man like RGV can do justice. It's more convincing & more intense & darker than 'Jogger's Park', fresh & entertaining 'Chini Kum'or Ben Kingsley-Penelope Cruz starrer 'Elegy' (2008). It's one of the most sound, serious & maturely made landmark film of the RGV.If you haven't watch it, you are seriously missing a gem.Ratings-9/10"
