" One of the VERY VERY few good Bolly comedy movies.","Although this film stars some new people, not from Priyadarshan's usual line up (Aftab, Akshaye Khanna, Rimi Sen) it is still the one of the best movies. Akshaye Khanna does a very good job in this movie, and so does Aftab Shivdasani. They provide quite a few scenes with hard laughs, but the best one is Paresh Rawal of course. He delivers another brilliant role just like in Hera Pheri, except in this one he is a wealthy villager. His village accent is very good. I laughed at all his jokes. The rest of the cast did a pretty good job too.I usually don't give movies 10/10, so as you can see this film had to be that good for me to give it a 10. Other movies that I recommend are: Hera Pheri, Andaz Apna Apna, and Phir Hera Pheri." 
" SIDESPLITTING COMEDY!!!","This movie was truly awesome!  It is so hilarious, it will definitely make you laugh uncontrollably!  I have never a seen such a great comedy.  This is now my favorite movie.  Paresh Rawal, of course, gave another brilliant performance.  Akshaye and Aftab also were terrific.  It is really funny how all the characters have some connection to each other and how continuous misunderstandings among these 26 characters lead to absolute chaos! Whoever wrote the script for this movie is a genius.  The movie also makes fun of cliched Bollywood scenes.  If I could, I would give this movie an 11 out of 10.  This is one comedy you cannot afford to miss!" 
" Excellent....","I have to say that I have never seen a movie with more comedy then this one.... In the movie many stories are progressing in parallel and all of them are beautifully inter-linked. You have to give the story writer the due credit for keeping all stories inter linked. I cant find even a single bad point in this movie. Even the songs are very good specially the video of "Chain aapko Mila".... Never ever I like to see a video of a song more then once but I must have seen it hundreds of times and still I find it hilarious.... The best part of the movie is of course Paresh rawal with his acting. I think all the characters have done justice to their role." 
" Priyadarshan delivers a comedy from many of the greatest comedy entertainers","Basically this movie gets good when it gets into it's second half Shakti Kapoor and Rajpal Yadav are absolutely stunning they are top of the line in their roles Paresh Rawal excels in his role and the main star cast especially Akshaye Khanna delivers a great job the total misunderstandings which evolve into total chaos delivers for a total 2 and a half hour entertainer Priyadarshan's first entertainer at a crazy comedy i feel is totally worth the attempt especially when i enjoyed his comedy Hulchul which came out after Hungama the songs are OK but the best song is " Mera Dil Tere Paas Rehne Dein" Nadeem-Shravan fans strictly Inever predicted the ending of this movie but i guess it was for the better gut-bursting comedy this is ultimate hilarity at it's best that shouldn't be missed gread job from a Malayalam film director on venture on giving us some Hindi entertainment" 
" Fantastic Comedy!!!!! Very Entertaining","Hungama is the best Indian comedy i've ever seen. I'm not an Indian but This movie was truly awesome. I must have seen it 100 times and still I find it very funny. A great theme making people laugh from the beginning till the end of the movie.Paresh Rawal was brilliant as usuall. Akshaye Khanna did good job. Aaftab Shivdasani, Shoma Anand, Shakti Kapoor, Rajpal Yadav, Tiku Talsania did great funny roles. Rimi Sen looks beautiful and very talented. It is so hilarious,it will definitely make you laugh uncontrollably! I have never seen before such this great Indian comedy movie. It is really funny how all the characters have some connection to each other and how continuous misunderstandings among these characters lead to absolute chaos! Whoever wrote the script for this movie is a genius. Now Do watch!!" 
" intricate plot delivers the laughs","I watched this movie because I'm an Akshaye Khanna nut. Although I was sad to see he wasn't in more scenes, clearly it's better to have a supporting role (with top billing!) in a good film than the lead in a bad one.The plot of this story has so many twists and turns that whomever wrote it should get a literary award. The way the characters are linked together is truly clever and hilarious. I think this movie is 10 times funnier than Hera Pheri.And, none of the actors disappoint! How great is that?Very entertaining. 9 out of 10" 
" the best bollywood comedy ever","i normally don't like bollywood films, as i think they are too over-dramatic, and unrealistic but hungama has to be the best Hindi film i have ever seen. although the plot is a bit complicated, i felt the love story emerging was there best bit about the film, as i didn't know what was a going to be the final coupling. it was a film of misunderstandings, which has been done a lot in film, it was still very enjoyable in hungama. the only thing i didn't like was akshaye knanna's character,who i felt was over eager and a bit too cheesy, but i can tolerate him as it was an exceptional film, and i think the more you watch it, the more it will get funnier, but still the best bollywood romantic comedy i have ever seen." 
" what a chaos (hungama)","Hungama can easily be dubbed as India's answer to the 'Comedy of Errors'.
It works out really well when you do not expect a lot out of a movie and coming out thinking - yeah that was great. That is the case with this one. The cast were not all that appealing and the songs were passable - so when I actually got to watch the movie it made me sit up and realize that maybe bollywood could do comedy and did indeed have a sense of timing and humor.
The confusion or chaos revolves the name Anjali - it is the name of a prominent businessmans (Paresh Rawal) wife and also the name of a girl on the run from her past trying to make it in Mumbai (Rimi Sen). There are then a handful of characters that cross their paths and it inadvertently causes a lot of confusion. There is not enough space here to go into them, so its better to go and watch the movie.On the acting side the show stealer is Paresh Rawal. He is excellent in this movie - it will have to be said that he is on par if not better then Johnny Lever nowadays, if not better. The two main leads Akshaye and Aftab also were terrific with a good change to see the later doing some good acting. Rimi Sen is good and fits into the story well. The rest of the support cast (and there are plenty of them) are well balanced and compliment the story well.The two backbone characteristics of the movie namely the script and music would have my mixed views. The story is excellent. But the music left something to be desired.Overall its one of those movies you would watch when you just want to have fun." 
" one of the best comedy ofthe year...","watched it only yesterday.... with friends...in short its a laugh riot..very well directed by Priyadarshan, the same guy who gave us Hera Pheri. Its confusion all the way in the movie, only the viewers know whats going on. Good acting by Paresh Rawal (as usual), Akshaye, Shakti Kapoor, Rajpal Yadav n even Rimi Sen's acting is praiseworthy. Overall a very good entertaining movie in a class of its own. For all the fans of 'andaz apna apna' n 'hera pheri' a must watch." 
" An excellent comic crapper by Priyadarshan","You can watch this movie in whichever mood you are into. It will always make you laugh and make your day. Superb acting by Paresh Rawal, Akshay Khanna, Rajpal Yadav and others. The plot of all actors is nicely interlinked which reflects the intelligence of the writer.
Priyadarshan is an ace director who gets the most out of all of his actors." 
" Fantastic movie","The only movie you can watch again and again you will never get bored. Must Watch.." 
" Superb funny and comical movie","This is a honest comedy movie I ever watched in my whole life it's really hilarious Great acting performances I appreciate them a lot akshaye is topper aft-ab does well acting Rimi is fine other were really impressive good songs it's the best comedy film I ever seen must watch the screenplay is outstanding and good editing I am a die hard fan of akshaye so that's why I chooses to watch this blockbuster comedy movie my rating is 10/10 superb movie" 
" One of Priyadarshan's good comedies","Priyadarshan became a known face in comedy after HERA PHERI(2000), followed by the dud YEH TERA GHAR YEH MERA GHAR(2001), Hungama was a comeback for him and the film did well. The film is an adaptation of Priyadarshan's own 1984 film Poochakkoru Mookkuthi; which itself was based on Charles Dickens' play, The Strange Gentleman. The film does take time to set in, with multiple stories at one GO. but the scenes between Paresh-Shoma and the entire affair angle of Paresh-Rimii and Akshaye-Shoma is hilarious though the other confusions don't get settled properly, some are left hanging midway and never settled. Aftab-Rimii angle is okay, but the love triangle does seem hasty. Rajpal's track is funny and also Shakti Kapoor's track The end is like HERA PHERI but Priyan doesn't settle all the subplots only the main storyDirection by Priyan is good Music by Nadeem Shravan is decent, Pari is melidious, while other songs are good but their placements distractParesh Rawal is the scene stealer, the actor is in character unlike his latter comedies and delivers comedy in a straight face Shoma Anand is hilarious too though she does go overboard at many places Akshaye Khanna is decent in his role, Rimii Sen in her debut with a dubbed voice is decent though she does come across too much at many places Aftab Shivdasani is decent too, though he gets less scope Rajpal Yadav is amazing in a half baked role, Manoj Joshi is okay Tiku Talsania, Sanjay Narvekar, Neena Kulkarni are okay, Jagdish(Malyalam actor) who plays the servant is superb." 
" Laugh-Riot - A gem of a movie from Priyadarshan","An out-an-out laugh riot, with amazing dialogues and camaraderie among all the actors. A must watch for all the comedy genre fans. The acting done by all the actors were brilliant right from the housekeeper who pretends he is the owner of the house to the man who comes from the village to get married to his childhood mate. The songs of the film are tepid and they are not needed. so one feels they have been forcefully inserted. There is never a dull moment in the movie. I have watched it more than 5 times now. Lost count though! It's a much watch for comedy movie fans. The movie is the best from Priyadarshan's garage even though it does not feature any big names in it." 
" An epic based on just misunderstandings!","This is one of the ever green films and hugely popular in our family, inasmuch that even my father, who in his entire life mustn't have watched more than 30-40 films, loves it to bits and never misses it if he ever catches a TV channel showing it, it without a shadow of doubt being his all-time favourite comedy film. So I had arranged this for myself just to re-live those childhood memories, those moments when it used to make me laugh for even hours afterwards. There're no two ways about the fact that I fully enjoyed it again, although I'm not too well right now and lack of concentration has been a big issue for me of late.There are different kinds of comedy films, from which of one kind are those that are based on funny dialogues and scenes, and then those which completely thrive the set of misunderstandings that are built from the first part of the film to the climax. 'Hungama' falls into the latter category, and in what a tremendous way it qualifies for that category! The misunderstandings are so many and they come in so many different forms that one even feels slight bit of sympathy for Mr. Tiwari; from an affair it escalates into having a son from another marriage to a daughter from another marriage!Some scenes are so so ridiculously funny and outrageous that the whole imagination captures the comedy, like the scene of being caught in the bushes, to seeing his wife's supposed boyfriend look around in the house for his wife and even boldly asking where she is, to Jeetu asking Mr. Tiwari to hand over his wife to him with, of course, his 'aashirvaad'. So it's a brilliantly made film and must go down as amongst Priyadarshan's finest works. It is a Bollywood classic that I don't think will ever get old." 
" Poor Comedy that relies on past hits of the same genre","Hungama (meaning "Confusion" in Hindi) is a comedy of errors. The only problem is among all the errors, that the audience is left wondering where the comedy was. The acting is average, with the exception of Paresh Rawal, who still manages to bring a chuckle or two. The plot is too complex to keep track of and thus gets stale very quickly, the music is ... well... never mind the music.It seems like the Hindi movie industry has run out of original ideas for comedy movies. While Hera Pheri, which was a similar movie, did have quite a few funny moments and had more originality, hungama is quite simply, a blind rip-off ... not in terms of the plot, but the comic-style.Do not waste your time with this one. You are better off watching Andaz Apna Apna or Hera Pheri a second time.3/10"
