" A Movie of Many excellent performances...","Went to the Theatre with a concept of it being a political Satire with a good ensemble cast....But it turned out to be a satire with no specification on its type ... Ekkees Topon ki salaami is a story of a common man whose last wish was to receive Ekkees Topon ki Salaami after his death....Story is as simple as it can be.....First let me point out the faults. The way this story moved is totally unrealistic. The First Twenty minute was comprising two songs, and that too in a satire flick..Torture...In the entire movie only one song was relevant and that was Ghoor Ghoor ke....Now The GOOD points which overlapped the faults , even the unrealistic approach to the topic..Corruption, poverty, politicians thriving on the the common people and siphoning their blood out is a common scenario in this part of the continent...So making a movie out of it is a tricky business, the director must pull out something to make it interesting, and he did that...Every actor in the movie overacted and believe me that was the Major Contributary factor that made the story a grand success...the director placed certain important issues other than the political set up in a such a delicate way...that one will simply go with the flow and can feel the seriousness of the issues, like Parents spending their entire income on their children's future or hoe living a life entirely based on honesty is the most difficult task in this era....and this list continues..As a corrupt politician, through quirky dialogues Bhagwan Tiwarii Portrayed the reality, of how Politician thinks the more scam they can perform , the more popular they are....even they can out of shame if their co-workers possess a bigger scam in their purse..Aditi Sharma gave one of the movie's best scene...As a PS to minister, she showed that inspite of all difficulties you have to write a perfect speech although its original narration is full of filth...I loved that conversation...Uttara ji gave a stellar performance, She showed how Satta revolves..And not to mention the stars of the Movie Anupamkher ji, Divyendu sharma and Neha Dhupai...per excellence...Neha Dhupia perfectly over acted her parts that was definitely needed for the movie..she is indeed talented...Anupam ji is a maestro when it comes to acting and he proved that...oh his conversation with BMC officer And his sons were so real....Divyendu sharma...boy boy ....u r a charmer and a performer....Disappointment: Ram Sampath....the movie only needed The Ghoor Ghoor ke song...rest all were unnecessary..Surprise: Rahil Quazi....Man u wrote excellent dialouges...It is definitely a Watch...." 
" Do watch this brave, innovative and enjoyable political satire, promoting strong family values reminding you of Hrishikesh Mukherjee.","A small film offering an unexpected novelty expressed well through its bold and well written content certainly gives you a much better satisfaction than a forcibly hyped biggie supported by a known star. And that's the reason whenever there's a film like EKKEES TOPPON KI SALAAMI thankfully bringing that much awaited relief and change, it rightly deserves an extra star and viewer's support too for encouraging its makers to continue doing the good work in the future.With its subtle indications towards few real life political names, the film is a well written attempt to expose the silly but unknown backstage truths about the corrupt mindsets where everyone is willing to have the power eyeing on his personal monetary benefits be it a politician, a party worker, a journalist, a mistress, a brother, a son or even a mother having her 'ultimate end' closer than anyone else. And amongst these mean, dirty minds lives an honest Municipal Corporation worker superbly played by Anupam Kher, who gets slammed with a corruption notice on the very last day of his service in a shockingly insulting manner by his newly appointed superior.Now since it will be a crime to disclose the film's extremely fresh and interesting story-plot killing its main attraction, I would simply like to add that ETKS is a two part film wherein the first half has some extremely powerful family sequences depicting the ideology clashes between the father-son reminding you of the works of Hrishikesh Mukherjee. And the second is full of many satirical, comic sequences through which a strange wish is fulfilled making you recall another classic of the past JAANE BHI DO YAARON.Personally I would strongly recommend the movie for its first half in particular as it may teach you a very precious lesson of life about how to respect our aging parents giving them our utmost love, care and time before its too late. Admitting our shortcomings, we do tend to lose our temper often facing the difference of opinion with the elders. But idea clashes with the old parents and ignoring/disrespecting or insulting them shamelessly are two different things altogether which need to be understood by every youngster urgently. Thankfully EKKEES TOPPON KI SALAAMI does have that important lesson executed beautifully and thus deserves to be seen for those 30 minutes before the intermission as a must.Coming to the second half, yes the film has few flaws and for many 'thinking minds' it might be quite weird and illogical too in its final hour. But to answer them all, I would like to remind that one of the most famous comedies of Hindi Cinema i.e. JAANE BHI DO YAARON also had all weird and illogical similar sequences in its second half which were never questioned by anyone (in the subsequent years) as the film enjoys an indisputable cult status accepted by one and all. However it's a different irony that JBDY which at present is immensely famous as an enjoyable laugh riot was in reality intentionally made as a strong political satire on the corrupt system by its makers raising some serious questions. Sadly the satire was forgotten fast and the comedy took all the limelight in the following decades disclosing the unconcerned public mentality as usual.Returning to ETKS, it has many excellent satirical as well as entertaining sequences like the one revealing the truth behind the politicians great speeches, a spoof on the famous news anchor Arnab Goswami along with a renowned opposition leader, an interesting interpretation of a party symbol as a thumb shown to the public, the cunning change in outlook of an opportunist mother after the sudden demise of her politician son, the black money lying in the Swiss bank accounts and the evident corruption within the system regarding jobs and homes allotted to the Government employees. The soundtrack doesn't give anything great to write about but a tight script (moving at a great pace), fine cinematography and an apt background score contributes a lot to its overall impact in the end especially with the track "Break The Line" smartly used towards the climax.Finding a unique plot for his enjoyable, thought provoking satire, director Ravindra Gautam surely deserves the praises for making a film straight from the heart and extracting many outstanding performances from his entire cast bringing that much needed freshness in our Hindi cinema. Certainly one of those promising names to look forward in the future who can represent the common man on screen so wonderfully proving to be a bright flashing light in the dark cloud of all commercial ventures targeting the first weekend earning alone ignoring the content.Displaying their highly impressive individual skills it is really tough to pick up any one as the best performer in the well-chosen cast ensemble. ETKS has Anupam Kher once again giving a splendid, flawless performance as the honest father, despite having only few scenes in the script as per its novel storyline. In fact such is the sincerity in his realistic performance that one finds it really hard to believe that he is the same person hosting a talk show on the smaller screen looking quite young and entertaining. Next is Divyendu Sharma repeatedly proving his remarkable talent with an excellent, emotional performance as the younger son going through the sudden transformation. Manu Rishi Chadha gives another fine performance post KYA DILLI KYA LAHORE. Aditi Sharma is the surprise package of the film in an effortless moving act as Divyendu's love interest. Plus we have Neha Dhupia (with her much publicized tribute to the item numbers of the past), Rajesh Sharma, Uttra Baokar, Asif Sheikh and the entire supporting cast playing their given parts real well.Recommended for everyone loving Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Rajkumar Hirani kind of cinema." 
" A social satire that tickles you pink","Ekkees Toppon is a perfect satire that tickles you pink. The acting is genuine and sincere. Anupam Kher is exceptional as always. The situation of a common man is highlighted well and deserves a special applause. The songs could have been better, i feel. But overall the movie does deliver when it comes to entertainment. The trailer of the movie had reminded me of Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro thanks to the presence of a "moving dead body", but the movie's story is totally different from the cult comedy; the element however is the same - amazing! The direction is also good. The cinematography is decent. The song "Ghoor ghoor ke" is a visually timepass thanks to the concept. Interestingly, Neha Dhupia does a good job." 
" Mindblowing !!!","At first i was reluctant to go watch the movie. My friends who are fans of Anupam Kher forced me to go for it. Even going with a reluctant mind i really loved it. Watching Neha Dhupia come back on screen was so amazing! she still looks beautiful. its a must watch for sure. A movie with a social message that actually conveys its message smoothly made me like the film. Unlike Jai Ho or Kick. Anupam Kher is excellent as always. With the acting he does we know hes the best of the old lot. Overall and interesting movie...and a movie with a good flow.It worth a watch and i insist people should go and watch it. It's a much watch for families." 
" Excellent review with a real message","Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami features splendid performance by formidable actors. It has a very relevant social message that no one should miss. In addition to this, the movie is shown in a very entertaining way. A full on entertainment with a strong social message. Special mention to Anupam Kher who has done an awesome job. Divyendu Sharma is also great. Neha Dhupia is the special package in the movie The film is receiving great reviews from all reviews. Everyone need to watch this once in a life time movie. A movie for friends and family. A great idea that will certainly change peoples minds. The songs and the movie overall is awesome and a must watch!" 
" Amazingly hilarious watch","ETKS is a fresh comedy with a punch! The lead girls are amazingly dumb but look great on screen. Anupam Kher ji is a treat to sore eyes (which by the way is in the air) so leave your critical brains at home, and go for this one for a hearty laugh and a good time.

" Well-Intentioned & Well-Acted!","'Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami' went unnoticed & bombed at the box-office. But, that sad! 'Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami' is actually a Well-Intentioned & Well-Acted film, that deserved a much better fate. Not many have this watched nicely done effort, although it deserves to be seen!'Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami' follows two brothers and their quest to fulfill their father's last wish, a twenty-one gun salute.Director Ravindra Gautam deserves kudos for delivering a well-intentioned story, although the Writing doesn't always support him. Rahil Qaazi's Screenplay, though terrific in parts, goes slightly off-balance in its second-hour. The Writing is strong at times & even the dialogue are natural to the core. But, a stronger second-hour, definitely could've made things better! 'Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami' aces as far its performances are concerned. Anupam Kher is simply brilliant as the honest man, who's put to shame. The veteran actor sinks his teeth into the part & brings it out with flying colors. Divyendu Sharma is very sincere, while Manu Rishi is first-rate. Aditi Sharma is genuinely charming. Neha Dhupia is gloriously over-the-top, but Rajesh Sharma is flawless, yet again. Sudhir Pandey is fantastic.On the whole, 'Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami' has its heart at the right place." 
" Not An Ordinary Bollywood Film","Definitely not an ordinary Bollywood film .You might have seen many Bollywood movies which portray Good vs Evil to the audience , but this one definitely stands out from those film and gives a different effect . These days we have completely forgotten to respect and reward a person for his good deeds where as we worship all kind of evil people and praise their deeds . A movie made with a good intention . Must watch for all .Overall Acting - 9 (10/10 for Anupam Kher) Movie Script - 8 Music - 8My Rating 8/10" 
" Better then expected","There are some films which don't look promising, this film is one of them. It neither has face value nor does it have a great starcast or big production values. But yet the film is a quite good satire on Politics in India. It is well handled. The plot may not be earth shaking yet it's nice and does expose a lot of political hidden scams all done in a light manner,the second half gets more serious and it's well handled though at times it does get slow paced also too surreal at timesDirection is good Music is okay Anupam Kher is excellent as always, Divyendu Sharma excels and shows that he can carry different roles well too, Neha Dhupia is okay, Rajesh Sharma is superb, Manu Rishi gets ample scope and is good, Sudhir Pandey,Aasif Sheikh are all good" 
" Blunt Knife Reviews : Don't waste your money !!","The plot has a weak base and an even weaker cast. The movie leaves you hanging for the most part and that is where the problem is, This looks like a first time director tried his luck , all hands down a complete waste of your time than money.Cause money can be bought back , but the time is more valuable.But if you do not have anything else to do and want to exercise your right to waste the time, fear not there is good news , the 2nd half might make your bring out your emotional side and you might feel you need to get in touch with your family.Blunt Knife reviewsRobbiiee"
