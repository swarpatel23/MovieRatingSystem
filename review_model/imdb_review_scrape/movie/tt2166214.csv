" Decent Comedy but with It's Faults","First I would like to clarify that aside from having Akshay Kumar in a starring role, this film is nothing like the Khiladi movies from the 90's. I will start this review with the negative aspects of the film and then move on to where it succeeds. Firstly, as is increasingly common with Bollywood films these days, the Punjabi element is noticeably there both linguistically and thematically. This is not so wrong except that I think that over-Punjabization makes it somewhat difficult to follow some plot lines and jokes. Additionally, there is not really a message in this film to follow and some of the jokes fall stale. Also, the storyline about Akshay Kumar's character's long lost brother does seem to be not only tangential, but also completely unnecessary. In addition, while many of the fight scenes are choreographed well, some of them do tend to drag and could have been more sharply edited. On to what the film does well. The supporting cast, other than the non-Indian characters (as per usual with Bollywood) all do a fair job in creating a hilarious atmosphere. Asin is adequate in her role, though she has been typecast so far in Bollywood as the pretty girl who gets duped a lot and does not have much to do other than be eye candy, a standard which she adheres to here with aplomb. Akshay Kumar and Mithun Chakraborty both do an excellent job in creating a comic atmosphere without being overly obnoxious, which is somewhat helped by the characteristically helpless look that Chakraborty has perfected for his role as the stern patriarch (he has played the same role in about a half dozen movies by now so he should be getting good at it in any case). In addition, the songs are fairly catchy in their own way, though Himesh Reshammiya has a hard time making a love song not sound ridiculous. Overall this was a decent masala entertainer from Bollywood that, while not comedic gold, is nevertheless a far better outing than some of the other choices from Akshay Kumar this past year. Good for a watch." 
" Please Stop Making rubbish movies or else i will also start making them :D","I don't know whats happening with bollywood....the good movies are all gone..=..Movies with no stories,No Powerful comedies..in short nothing khiladi 786 and than dabang 2...2012 may not be the end of the world but it surely is for bollywood :( :( ..The Original ones are gone..with the end of "Jab tak hai jaan"-YASH CHOPRA,This might be the reason for me to switch to Hollywood more and more nowadays...I am not saying that all the movies are bad but standards are deteriorating day-by-day..this movie is the live example of that....The movie is bekaar....total flop.Don't watch it...And if you really want to see this movie than take a saridon and watch it...lolz I hope for the best in 2013...and look forward To watch the best movie of the decade this year... By This review i just wanted to beg the stars to Please look at the script before making movie...Otherwise they will be headache for you as well as for us..." 
" Its high time Bollywood takes its audience seriously","In spite of witnessing recently released classic Akshay Kumar flops ( Tees Maar Khan , Joker ) i still went for this movie remembering Akshay's old action flicks (Khiladi, Khiladiyon ka .....) hoping to see Akshay in a serious yet a comic role. I realized my mistake 15 minutes in to the movie.Making funny faces, speaking in a funny tone and funny character names does not make audiences laugh. Using a concept which was tried tested and horribly failed at makes the movie even more boring,if i could recall i hardly laughed that too at the stupidity of the film makers that how could they even think that this stuff will sell ? to defend their faults they will title it 'Mindless Comedy' there's no such thing as mindless comedies we pay good amount of money for purchasing a movie ticket and we deserve an intelligent script, lately film makers are making such movies and calling them comedies and changing the audience perception about comedy movies. Where are the movies like "3 Idiots , Dhamaal , Hera Pheri , and the legend 'Andaaz Apna Apna' those movies are called as comedies they were intelligently funny.I really wouldn't suggest this movie to any one, and there isn't anything worth reviewing in this movie. I felt insulted and stupid going for this movie, and would want our film makers to stop treating audiences as foolish as their movies, and work a little bit harder when they are writing scripts and stories.I rate this movie 3 because of the effort of 100's of people put in to this movie even though it was horrible and also for its music ( though i am sure it must have been copied from somewhere, still two numbers in this movie are catchy remaining songs like Saari , Saari Raath made me laugh like crazy though it was meant to be sad or a romantic song Himesh reshmaiyya stooped down to one more level just when we thought that he couldn't be any worse ) If you are looking for a comedy there's nothing new here, i would rather suggest you to rent few Hindi classic comedies and enjoy them instead of making the actors and film makers of this kind rich for free." 
" The mass manipulation of media by moneyed mainstream has tarnished the quality of Indian cinema, giving birth to products such as Khiladi 786","Plot: Akshay Kumar plays himself but since he is an 'actor' and the 'film' requires it's cast to have unique character names, he is therefore called Bahattar Singh; the guy is a con policeman whose entire family of equally tough men believe in making money catching criminals and sometimes framing innocents wrongfully, but the same guy is also rejected by every girl in the town. The leading lady Asin asininely plays a crime lord's daughter whose lover remains behind bars and so she takes all her prospective bridegrooms on a deadly car drive so that they can reject her. The marriage-maker is played here by Himesh Reshammiya, whose character's idiosyncrasies put him in great trouble. Supporting cast made up by people usually associated with Akshay Kumar films.After being repeatedly and uninhibitedly subjected to erratic zip-zap-zoom cinematography with not really visible attempts at fine-tuning, shoddy, so-obvious-it's- made-out-of-cheaper-quality-material set properties and horrifyingly loud and sometimes out-of-sync sound that has the ability to molest one's ear, an Indian like me has begun to believe that the availability of good technology, the assumption that the Indian audience always keeps their cerebrum aside while entering the theater and the mass manipulation of the media by the moneyed mainstream has corrupted many of today's Indian directors, actors and production crew, who seemed to have forgone the basic elements of creating a good cinema and completely left out the advantages of a well-penned script, thereby tarnishing quality completely in favor of show-me-the-money!Ah I feel so good now after getting this off my chest! This the the pent up feeling (or rant) that bubbled within me with each new frame in Khiladi 786, whose director is incompetent, whose producer (the lead actor's wife herself) is a cash cow, whose cinematographer is reckless, whose sound recordist is insane and whose actors are extremely aware of their limitations yet incredibly proud that they still are minting money while hundred of capable actors aren't getting their dues. Salman Khan dropped the bar to depths rivaling Othello's hapless state after realizing the deceit played on him by the manipulative Iago, but Akshay out-lowers him with smelly poo excreted into an expensive diaper. Only time shall tell whether it is Salman who goes even lower in Dabang 2 or it is some third person who walks away with the usually-dreaded-but-now-coveted-because- money-is-at-least-recovered Hall of Shame.Since the movie took it's audience for granted, I did the same for the movie: I left (read 'fled') during the interval. It should not be the way a movie should be critiqued but there are certainly exceptions such as this wacky piece. I'm not sure whether the director tried doing a Tarantino (i.e. using prominent qualities from low budget action film in developing a highly stylized, high quality movie, such as Kill Bill inspired by small budget Japanese martial arts films), but in case he did, then he has failed miserably. Just getting a better camera and better recording devices aren't the keys of making a better film; would Kill Bill have received such a glorious response had it just got a very expensive camera with sharper clarity and high-tech sound devices without creating the epic saga, using proper narrative devices or choreographing it's complex martial arts moves with beauty and precision? The people associated with Khiladi 786 are all spoilt brats who shamelessly exploit wrongly the resources they are able to obtain just because they have so much money. The most disturbing part of films such as Khiladi 786 is the open misogynist values it promotes. Asin's character is a rough rider who can only be controlled by a man, and so there's a humiliating sequence where Akshay's character Sattar dumps her on the shotgun seat, takes charge of the driver seat and drives at a monstrous speed to make her submit to his manhood completely. In between the sequence, the action is cut to a fantasy sequence where Sattar driving a swanky car and Asin sits beside him and acts like one of those bimbos in music videos. I've seen this with Salman Khan films too - nearly all his leading ladies literally act like they are completely powerless under Salman's mighty control.Seems like my rant has still not finished, but what else can said about this work? Akshay Kumar has admitted he isn't very talented as an actor but he proves now that he has stopped being an entertainer too. Asin has been having a Ghajini hangover for over two years and it's time she really tries her hand at some other profession. Reshammiya should suck his hubris about being multi-talented and stick to what he does best... Judge music shows that I don't watch so I do not get to see his face. The rest of the cast knows they risk losing their money-making jobs if either Akshay or Salman quits, so they remain loyal to their films, no matter how hopelessly their little talent is exploited. " 
" Laughter riot & a paisa vasool treat for Akshay & Salman fans, for the rest of us: stay away!","As long as Bollywood will continue making such cinema, we would be surprised when we get to see a 'Kahaani' or a 'Talaash'. Although this one's not as pathetic as Joker, nevertheless it falls in the same place.It felt like this movie was borrowed from Housefull2 , Ready & Rowdy Rathore. A cop image that reminds you of Dabangg and RR. A house full of goons/ wrong identities reminds you of House full 2 Akshay trying to impress Asin reminds you of Ready. The dialogues were simply song lines or copied from other movies. But there is 1 lesson to be learnt in this movie:Vertical parallel parking , sideways & jumping a car by our 'khiladi'.Asin repeats a 'ready'. Mithun continues his Housefull villainics. Johnny Lever has lost his touch. The other actors need not be mentioned. May be Riteish/Shreyas started charging money , hence Himesh had to replace them. And finally our Khiladi Akshay Kumar fails to do a Dabangg. The songs are one of the worst HR albums.Tough times lie ahead for Salman Khan but am sure he will be 'ready' to prove that he is more 'wanted' than our 'joker'. The Bollywood battle for the hero with maximum non sensical films is a tough competition between these 2 stalwarts ! Hope 1 of them wins soon and relieves us by 50%." 
" A Mindless Comedy!","'Khiladi 786' is A Mindless Comedy that is strictly meant for the masses of the hinterlands. It delivers mediocre entertainment!'Khiladi 786' Synopsis: A good for nothing match-maker arranges a marriage of a don's sister to a crook.'Khiladi 786' has a fairly entertaining first-hour, but the second-hour isn't. The Screenplay is inconsistent & pretty mindless. Sure, one doesn't mind escapism, but at least the goings-on could've been far more entertaining. Also, the songs pop-up pointlessly & drag the film's length. Ashish R Mohan's Direction is passable. Music by Himesh Reshammiya is foot-tapping, but the songs lend nothing to the narrative.Performance-Wise: Akshay returns as Khiladi after a long hiatus & he's simply superb. He delivers from start to end. Asin is her usual self. Himesh Reshammiya looks out of place. Mithun is sincere. Raj Babbar & Mukesh Rishi are mere gap fillers. Johny Lever & Manoj Joshi are effective in cameos. The actor who enacts the role of Asin's boyfriend is alright.On the whole, 'Khiladi 786' is mediocre." 
" Desi Kung Fu Hustle- Khiladi 786","KHILADI 786 REVIEWI am pretty damn sure every Bollywood fan knows what the Khiladi series is and has seen at least 1 Khiladi movie. The Khiladi series is a very interesting one and the Khiladi movies have absolutely no connection to each other except for the title, Akshay Kumar and hardcore action. The hype around Khiladi 786 was super high. So does Khiladi 786 meet the expectations? The plot of Khiladi 786 is simple: Mansukh (Himesh Reshammiya) is a failure in his match- making career and after his father, Champaklal (Manoj Joshi), kicks him out of the house, he attempts to get this one job right- of marrying off TTT's (Mithun Chakraborty) sister, Indu Tendulkar (Asin) to a decent family. He chooses Bahattar Singh (Akshay Kumar) for the job thinking he is a cop and even convinces TTT to pretend to be a cop in front of Bahattar's family. Little did Mansukh know that Bahattar and his family are in- fact con- men. Also, while Bahattar falls for Indu, she is in love with a prisoner Azad (Rahul Singh). What happens next when both families pretend to be cops in front of each other forms the story.The editing could have been better as well as the cinematography. Debutant director, Asish R Mohan does an average job behind the cameras. The songs are fantastic chart-busters with Balma, Sari Sari Raat and Hookah Bar being my favorites. Khiladi 786 is basically an over-the-top spoof. It does not take itself seriously and neither tells you to take it seriously. It has only one motive: ENTERTAINMENT at any cost. The comedy is over- the- top. There is slapstick, puns, one- liners, everything you expect. The action is over-the-moon. Bahattar is as fast as flash and as powerful as super- man but unlike Dabangg, Singham, etc. his powers have a reason here: 786. Akshay Kumar dwells well with both comedy and action. His punches and kicks (read: Roundhouse, Jump Roundhouse, Crescent, High Slap, etc.) are fantastic. Asin is good in a slightly different role and although her role isn't that big but it is meatier than her roles in Bol Bachchan and Housefull2. Mithun is very good as the goon and packs in good laughs. Himesh is average and tolerable. Others like Sanjay Mishra, Mukesh Rishi, Raj Babbar, Rajesh Khattar, Guggi, Johnny Lever are pretty good but they have been a bit wasted. The dialogues and one- liners bu Bunty Rathore are a treat though a few become annoying due to repetition. Overall, I would call this movie an over-the-top spoof. If you are looking for an intellectual movie, don't bother even watching the promos of this movie but if you are one of those who relish mass masala flicks, then make sure you watch this movie in the theaters and buy a DVD later on as well. Khiladi 786 would not be in my top 3 Khiladis but it does entertain for sure. Rating: 8/10" 
" Worst Strike By Khiladi Ever","Welcome + Namaste London(some part & song theme) = 786, a poor strike by Khiladi. It is a wonder that we still are making films like this. It has just the brand KHILADI in correlation with earlier movies. It is entirely old story by Himesh with a little change in masala. This is the 2nd time this year, where Akshay tries to be Salman. Nothing new in his acting. It is a scary nightmare that Akshay will come back with more films like this because I am sure that films like this will earn money. In first half, flick has some mindless comedy & action scene but 2nd half has only scenes(no action, no comedy & no story too). Asin has tried to do nothing new. Himesh is better then his previous roles. Rest is OK. Last Words: Go for this flick, if you are a die-hard fan of Akshay." 
" Disaster!!!!!!!!!","What can we expect from akshay?? It's also another desi film with all "tamil" style actions and "bakwas" story. Akshay's work in film is average as it is a comedy film and since long time he is doing this but screenplay and story are weak points of film. This film is for mass people who will love it and may also appreciate it. Almost all action scenes of films are without any sense for example as seen in trailer akshay break the engine of a jeep with his leg easily. so disgusting!!!! After a long time himesh's music is rocking not only in theaters but also all over India. We can say that akshay's acting and himesh's music are only positive sides of film otherwise there is nothing in film to watch.Comedy scene are not so impressive,i was just waiting for end of film. I suggest if you are akshay kumar's fan or you are a viewer from mass people who likes any "masala" movie like "Bodygaurd" and "Ready" then only you can watch it otherwise wait for 2 to 3 months it will be soon come on any channel." 
" Has very few funny moments and unnecessarily uses religious symbols to woo the viewers.","With a vision of repeating the success story of his Rowdy Rathore, Akshay Kumar returns with another action comedy which unfortunately stands nowhere close to that fairly entertaining Hit. So if you considered Rowdy Rathore as an average film then this goes to an even lower level with only a single plus point in the project being its catchy soundtrack.Therefore there is nothing to write about in details about Khiladi 786 as a movie experience to be honest. It is quite similar to Rohit Shetty kind of newly invented cinema and director Ashish R. Mohan strictly follows his mentor (Rohit), right from the first frame to the last including the punch lines, action, art direction and colours of the walls used in his sets too. But the film neither has got anything related to Akshay's personal brand of Khiladi, nor it has something to do with the religious symbols used in it scenes vaguely.Based on a thin storyline (written by Himesh Reshamiya), the first half does give you few moments to enjoy along with the much publicized action sequences. But the second half continues to slide downward & drags till the end resulting in an uninteresting film altogether. So despite of some good foot tapping songs, Khiladi 786 fails to keep you engaged and one easily feels like walking away even before it officially ends. Though Akshay performs well with a great confidence but there are very few good comic sequences featuring his famous comic timing and then the simply absurd double role in the climax further ruins the whole project completely. Himesh does more than one role in the film as the producer, writer, singer, composer & also the key supporting actor filling the space and he is just OK. Asin as usual is there for adding some glamour, Mithun Chakraborty is not as impressive as he was in Housefull 2 and I couldn't understand why Raj Babbar accepted such kind of meaningless minuscule role in this weak film. Putting it together Khiladi 786 has only got some dancing tracks to entertain you till they last and nothing else in the name of content. Moreover it was sad to see, how they used the religious symbols (786 & Khanda – The Sikh Symbol) just to attract the viewers and to add some value to the product commercially. Thankfully it was never done in such a ridiculous manner in the past by thoughtful directors such as Manmohan Desai, Yash Chopra and Manoj Kumar." 
" Fun to Watch","What makes KHILADI 786 conspicuous is the fact that it marks Akshay's return as 'Khiladi' after more than a decade. The led man bashes up 10/15 goons at one go like we swat mosquitoes, punches the wall in anger and the wall crumbles, even gulps down a man as if he we were consuming a soft drink from a straw yes, you read it right. This is a mere sample of what you gonna see in KHILADI 786. So, be prepared!KHILADI 786 is an old-school wacky potboiler. There isn't an iota of logic here and one is not even looking for intelligence, rationale or justification either. The film is packed with ingredients that constitute a wholesome entertainer such as humor, South-styled stunts with the one-man army outsmarting a bunch of deadly goons and of course, visually enticing songs every 15/20 minutes, but the writing has its share of hiccups... * The track of Asin's lover Rahul Singh is a yawn. What was the writer thinking while penning those sequences? * The climax, with Rajesh Khattar landing up at the wedding, Johny Lever unlocking himself from a room where he was held captive and Mushtaq Khan and Bharti suddenly becoming news reporters at the wedding maintop, looks too much of a cinematic liberty. On the plus side, the first-time director throws every trick in the book to entice the spectator and moves on to the next scene, before the viewer gets the feeling of deja VI. There's no denying that you actually enjoy certain moments in the narrative. The concept of having an African and Chinese in the family is so funny. Also, the lost-in-Mela brother surfacing in the end may look ridiculous, but makes you smile again. In a nutshell, the film caters to the mas-ala loving audience and the director has no qualms about admitting it. Himesh Reshammiya, who enacts a pivotal part in the film, belts out super numbers here. 'Balma', 'Lonely', 'Hookah' and 'Long Drive' have already made it to the music charts and are, without doubt, standout tracks. The action sequences are very much macho and executed with zest and enthusiasm. Akshay's Desi punches, raw and masculine action and the correct comic timing is sure to win a lot of hearts yet again. He is in his element, in complete form, brimming with charm and confidence. He's the mainstay of the film and lives up to the title every bit. Asin is the prototypical heroine who has to look her best, dance admirably and pair off with her on-screen man. Himesh Reshammiya does very well, while Mithun Chakraborty and Raj Babbar add lots of weight to their characters. Sanjay Mishra is in his element. Mukesh Tiwari impresses. Johny Lever is under-utilized. Manoj Joshi, Rajesh Khattar, Mukesh Rishi and Gurpreet Guggi are perfect. Mushtaq Khan, Bharti and Rahul Singh deserved better roles. Claudia Ciesla's item song adds glamor to the proceedings. On the whole, KHILADI 786 is not for purists, but for lovers of hardcore mas-ala films completely. If zany amusement, wacky humor and over the top entertainers is what you enjoy, this one's for you. Go, have fun!" 
" "The disaster movie of bollywood "","This part of "KHILADI" series from Askshay kumar's all famous "Khiladi movies " is not only the worst of all Khiladi's but the worst movie ever made in bollywood. The movie displays irritating comedy scenes and stupid Salmaan types takiya kalaam's and common scene challenging fight scenes . In the movie Akshay kumar not only is the undisputed fighter but at one point when he gets a scratch on his cheek from the Main villain they show tectonic shifts and volcanoes erupting . Dear Asin when will u start taking challenging roles .She is not getting out of her bubbly and dominating role And who would please explain MR .Himesh that he has no luck with talent or acting .We appreciate some of his songs but i seriously believe he should return back to his baseball cap and the mike .As for Akshay "Please start giving Indian audience some sensible movies else his future does not wander near limelight .finally the movie has nothing to offer except mindless giggles and laughter. For our intellectual and sensible audience, even if you have made the mistake to book tickets for this film, here's a serious note caution: DO CARRY A DISPRIN and then go off to sleep quietly in the multiplex !" 
" a good entertainer","i went to this movie expecting a typical childish comedy, and Himesh Reshammyas acting skills, are comedy all the way, so he was in the wright place for a change, and my advice to himesh would be only stick to sporting roles, never try lead again.!performances were okay cause there was nothing challenging to do in this movie. comedy was good until near the end.the only 2 things i really dis like about khiladi 786, is the plot and the action, plot was the same old typical and action was over the top to fake, which we only have Salman Khan to thank, for starting this super human era of in Bollywood, and the worst or the funniest scene of the movie was, when Akshay Kumar gets a hit across his face in the last action scene, they made it look like the end of the world an that just looked stupid! over all its a good entertainer if you just want to go for a laugh but don't expect anything special or a return of the khiladi cause its just a same old Akshay Kumar comedy." 
" Khiladi 786 (U) Hindi------------my Rating : 3.5/5 stars GOOD","Khiladi 786 (U) Hindi------------my Rating : 3.5/5 stars GOODIt is a mass masala entertainer with its brand name KHILADI......VERY GOOD: *Music : songs were superb by Himesh Reshammiya "Long drive and Hookah Bar" were worth to watch in 70mm screen. *Action : unlimited but they are funny..... *Comedy : awesome by Himesh Reshammiya *Direction : good not bad *Cinematography : superb in long drive song..... *Editing : plays a main role ......AVERAGE: *Performances : akshay was good but asin is average...... *Story : normal desi movie with unpredictable climax..... *Background music : especially they were good in fight scenes.... *Screenplay : second half lacks.....VERY BAD: *Certification by CBFC : this movie contains a Parental Guidance because have more cleavage visuals, so it may have awarded with an U/A certificate.....FINAL VERDICT: It is a clean one time watch movie with first half comedy and second half full of songs.... Don't misss the LONG DRIVE songThe film is a comedy about Mansukh, born to an owner of a marriage bureau Champak Lal. Akshay Kumar, Asin Thottumkal." 
" An average MASALA film","Director Ashish R Mohan has forced himself to make a mass entertainer film at the level that movie comes into bits and pieces. Somewhere you enjoy it but sometimes it's too loud and senseless. Story has nothing to tell new. Screenplay is good at places. Even they try to give it emotional touch but not through the main plot but with sub plot. A scene where ,Mansukh' father is being happy when his son scolds him for making silent call, is touchy. Climax is very boring and repetitive. The name of film according to content is 100% irrelevant. It is kept to consider a particular section of audience. Dialogues by Bunty Rathore is good among story and screenplay. It generates the required laughter. Performance wise Akshay Kumar is good. Himesh REshamiya is OK. Asin is so so. Mithun Da is very good. Famous and adorable female comedian, Bharti is also in movie but totally wasted. She is fantabulous performer but nothing to do in this film. Music by Himesh Reshamiya is good. When film drags, music supports it very well. Action by Jai Singh Nijjar is good. Single screen audience will enjoy it at a level but doubtful in multiplexes. After all an average film." 
" A new genre of Comedy with sprinkles of old wine","As they say keep your brains at home and watch with no expectations. I will not say so. Its a movie full with punchlines and "super" funny scenes and situation comedy.Rib tickling scenes and feel good songs add to the experience.Feel the movie with a group of friends or your family. Its a Roller coaster drive of comedy with smart punchlines everywhere.Did you like Obelix in your childhood? Or Chacha chowdhury? If not , opt out. For the rest leave all your extra baggage from your cynical mind and watch for a smile in face of you and your loved one.No movie can be perfect And that is the only reason why I give this movie a 9. Love it ,hate it but you can not ignore it. Khiladi Rocks!! again :D"
