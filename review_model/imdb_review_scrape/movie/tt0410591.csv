" Not too bad","It was delightfully amusing. I expected something much different considering the title of the movie. (Reference Along Came Polly). This one is worth a watch!!! The character development was nicely done, and the actors easily portrayed their respective parts with delicate expertise. Kudos to the director for using each individual's unique qualities to bring a very unrehearsed feel to the storyline. The end was quite different than what I had come to expect. I was still waiting for someone to produce a true SHART! It was a bit more cerebral than that however, but I think a Shart could have been thrown in tactfully.It seems that ten lines of text will be difficult to produce here without throwing in a spoiler. I guess commenting more on the director is in order. This is the second film I have seen from the same director and definitely much more my favorite. The Hindu films are interesting to watch in the fact that production differs so greatly from films produced in the United States. I would highly recommend someone view this film if it is your first "Hindywood" production; it will certainly whet your palate for more." 
" Disappointing","The acting is very good however the title is misleading. I was hoping for a slapstick edgy comedy regarding a sharting contest however that never happened." 
" Awesome!","Alright peeps this is how it's going down, i just saw this movie recently and at first i thought it was gonna be a moderate movie but i was wrong indeed. This movie did indeed show something different and has a lot of comedy to present and a few twists too. Tusshar Kapoor did great acting, as usual lol, i didn't find much problems in this movie and would say that indeed i would definitely watch this movie again as it is definitely the worth. Unlike any usual romantic movie this movie like i have mentioned brings out a whole different but yet great flavour and the twist in the movie makes it even more interesting. Still not getting the picture? What are you waiting for?! Go and watch the movie! :D"
