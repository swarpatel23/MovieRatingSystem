" Nothing new in Ken Ghosh's much awaited musical.","It's obvious to have huge expectations from a musical movie, directed by Ken Ghosh, who is known as one of the pioneer directors of music videos in India. And the hopes even rise further if the project has the youthful Shahid Kapoor (post 'Kaminey') and the energetic Genelia D'Souza (after 'Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na') as its lead couple. Hence, everyone was eager to see a spectacular show with probably a novel storyline accompanied by some brilliant dance sequences, melodious songs, amazing picturisations and tender love moments between the young couple on the screen. But surprisingly, Ken comes up with a very poorly written, confused and un-inspiring movie as his third directorial venture after "Fida" & "Ishq Vishq".Right from the start, "Chance Pe Dance" fails to grab your attention as it straight away opens with a song coming from no-where. Even the titles begin after the song gets over, so there is no explanation why the song was there in the first place. Secondly, just after 15 minutes into the movie, a normal movie-lover can easily guess its complete storyline till the end and that's where the movie loses its main ground of the expected box office success. Based on a routine plot of a struggler coming to Mumbai, with hopes of making it big, "Chance Pe Dance" has got nothing to stand out as its merit, apart from the spirited performance of Shahid Kapoor.In other words, Shahid is the only "Chance" for the movie to impress its viewers and I sincerely doubt he alone would be able to save it. The flick has several serious issues in its execution, which forcibly restrict it to be called as a below average project. Here they are for your consideration:1. The moment a song starts in the movie, it shifts to a music video mold, which is no doubt the forte of its director Ken Ghosh. Though the songs are indeed a treat to watch, but it seems Ken worked more hard on the songs and less on his story.2. The movie has a completely avoidable track of a school and its students winning a dance competition due to their dance teacher Shahid. The sequence, which is highly inspired from "The School of Rock" (2003), is not scripted well, gets hurriedly finished and looks like a misfit in the movie.3. A director who can be called as the Master of Music Videos, ideally must have a good ear and incredible music sense. But Ken simply disappoints in this department as he is not able to get any good songs from the otherwise talented singer Adnan Sami. The music of "Chance Pe Dance" is a big let-down, especially with a weak finale song at the reality show in the climax.4. It seems that both the writer and director are pretty confused regarding what their lead characters have to do on the screen. Shahid, who is supposed to be an aspiring talented actor, is more interested in showing his dancing skills than the acting. On the other hand, Genelia, who plays a choreographer in the movie, is given no detailed sequence of teaching the dancing steps to anyone. In fact she seems to be more interested in acting, with all her cute mannerisms and doesn't even talk about dance in the movie. Mohnish Behl, is the most confused one, who at first selects Shahid for his movie and then suddenly rejects him, without any reason.5. The most irritating one comes towards the climax, when Shahid is participating in a big channel' reality show in which we are simply not shown any of his competitors. The viewers only get to see Shahid's performance on the stage (that's too a dancing one) and he easily goes on to win the acting contest and becomes a star.In the acting department, Shahid is the only savior in the movie who gives a sincere and spirited performance which shows more of his sensitive and emotional persona. He might be counting a lot on this movie but may not get the desired results at the box office. Genelia as his lover, performs much better than her previous movies. But the cool and pretty girl doesn't get a well written role and thus cannot be blamed for anything. Parikshit Sahni repeats his fatherly act of "3 Idiots", but still manages to impress & Vikas Bhalla is a bit loud in his few scenes.In the end, looking at the track record of the talented director Ken Ghosh, one wonders, why he chose this kind of completely predictable subject for his third important movie which also had the most sellable stars at his disposal. Was this the story he was working on, in this long gap of almost 5 years? Or the movie was a victim of an uncontrolled delay without his fault.To sum up, "Chance Pe Dance", which was more publicized as a dancing musical, has only few dancing sequences to watch out and no particular song to rave about. The choreography and song picturisation does entertain you at times, but in the absence of some equally good tracks and a novel script, they fail to create a lasting impact." 
" Yaba Daba Yahoo!!!!","To cut it straight as everyone knows the movie didn't get good reviews but take my word the movie is not as bad as people think.. Loads of struggler movies have been made and you have heard the same story over and over again but where lies the difference?? The answer is the moments!! Yes watch for its moments and the passion which Shahid injects into the role...Ken Ghosh who set the box office on fire with his Ishq Vishq this time slips due to his not-so-new script.. The only thing which earned the movie some respect was Shahid's unmatched performance! His dance sequences are superb and choreographed by Marty Kudelka who has choreographed stars like Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson.. The irony is that despite having four music directors in the movie the music is not so great and you don't even remember the count of the songs after you watch the movie!! Genelia as usual is OK! Parikshat Sahni is the new Dad of Bollywood and Mohnish Behl was satisfactory and the children of his dance class were surprisingly charming!! But the standout performance was from Shahid whose struggling act and honest expressions make you smile!! If you wondering what to extract from this review then watch the movie for its fun moments and of course Shahid and his dance.. It will make you smile!!" 
" A Nutshell Review: Chance Pe Dance","Well it seems like Dance movies are the rage these days, and this week alone we have two films that seemingly centers on dance, with Jump coming from China/Hong Kong, and Chance Pe Dance from Bollywood, both being romantic comedies appealing to their respective distinct demographics. And it's not too surprising that unlike dance films of old where there's a male-female pair who would exhibit some signature moves on the dance floor, the contemporary films this week have absolutely none of that, which in some ways is a pity.Chance Pe Dance follows recent Bollywood films such as Luck Pe Chance in having their characters lament about the open secret of their film industry, where one has to be well connected, or come from an influential family in the industry in order to have one's big break served on a silver platter. For the rest of the mortals aspiring for that opportunity, it's more hard work, toil and sweat in order to get noticed, otherwise it's an endless cycle of mundane work to pay the bills, and juggling auditions in between.Shahid Kapur plays one such struggler from Delhi, Sameer Behl, who has spent the last 3 plus years trawling the audition houses of Mumbai in order to find work in the film industry. Living under meagre terms, he gets disappointed time and again, which is pretty much against the way he was brought up to believe that his good looks and charisma automatically meant he'd be the hero in his life, all the time. The narrative takes a very whirlwind snapshot of Sameer's life, highlighting his debts and being played out by both his best friend as well as filmmakers who promise him the sky, but never hesitant to pull the rug from under his feet.The story tries to jam pack too many subplots into the film, which makes you wonder whether this is a dance film if at all. First of all, there's the school days arc, where in order to sustain his city living, Sameer takes up a teaching job, imparting his dance skills to pesky children (he's never good with them) in order to help them win their dance competition. The key message here is of course if one couldn't do anything with one's current lifetime, there's always the imparting of skills to the next generation for them to live the dream that we have missed out on. This story arc could have been better fleshed out, other than to be squeezed into the film just before the intermission, and then resolved right after the film resumes.Then there's the continuation of Sameer's own struggle, where he has to learn never to give up because a life-changing opportunity may just be around the corner. In what would be like an American Idol clone of a dance/idol contest, this story too wasn't fleshed out properly and we're taken in for quite the fast tracking from the competition's start, right to the finale, with nary any tension due to the lack of competitive characters, and the larger culprit being the lack of dance (it's chance pe dance after all, right?)But the largest waste here was the under utilization of the character Tina, played by Genelia D'Souza, a choreographer whom Sameer serendipitously meets, and falls in love with. The character reminded me of Asin's Kalpana from Ghajini, the free-spirited, strong girl who teaches a thing or two to her guy about what it means by being resilient. I thought Genelia looked like Asin too from certain angles, and possessed the same vivacity here as well, together with some really stunning dance moves that we would see at the start of the film, with so much promise that when the lead duo gets paired together, sparks will fly and magic will happen. But it didn't! If there's anything to rue about, it's precisely this missed opportunity to have the duo perform a lot more dance numbers than one which quite sedately celebrates their love for each other, by mucking around exotic locales.For a dance movie, I wouldn't doubt that Bollywood cannot pull one off, given the musical like quality in almost all of the films, but it's a real pity that Chance Pe Dance is not that film. Thankfully the leads have charisma and share pitch perfect chemistry together, which managed to carry the film through from start to end, limited dance moves notwithstanding." 
" Simple joyful fun","I went into this movie looking for a lift of spirits and I was not disappointed. I did not have prior expectations from the actors or the director as I am new to Bollywood movies. The movie is gorgeous in its bright colors, beautiful people, delightful music and dance, and provides a refreshing and enlightening look at Indian modern cinema culture. The story is simple - the basic human drama of the struggle to achieve one's dream, find love, and be recognized by parents and peers for your special gifts. I did not have English subtitles and the flow of the beautiful Indian language interspersed with a bit English was enough to tell me what was happening. Shahid Kapoor was powerful in his beauty and dramatic dancing and his screen presence was delightful at all moments. His co-star Genelia Dsouza was graceful and lovely to watch. This movie did have a bit of everything including the kitchen sink thrown in the plot, but it all works together nicely to produce classic finding-one's-destiny, true love, redemption through the love of children and being true to yourself kind of story. The people who trashed this film I think just didn't get what it is. It is not to be taken as a serious drama. Chance pe Dance is an ice cream cone on a hot day, and stick of cotton candy, a walk through a rose garden in full bloom...a simple delight for the senses, a moment of diversion from troubling times." 
" Everyone Deserves A CHANCE !!",""Everyone Deserves A CHANCE !!" with this view I entered the theatre. To my expectations I found this movie up-to-the-mark.This movie builds an Environment as if we are ourselves in the movie. Storyline is quite touching having a long-lasting impact on viewers. The movie depicts the struggle of the current generation whose talents are suppressed by the influential personalities.We all being a part of this system can feel it ourselves. The movie is a family-entertainer and has hilarious comedy sequences.Ken Ghosh has done a great job on his part. This movie is certainly better than his Directorial debut and creates a milestone in his Career. Acting by Shahid, Genelia and Mohnish Behl(despite his short appearance)were great. Dancing talent of Shahid is an eye-candy to the viewers. "Pal mein hi" song enraptures the audience. To sum up this movie is a great entertainer and also gives a great social message. Finallly this movie is a worth watching with numerous memorable moments(especially the South Indian ad by Shahid)so go watch the movie with your family!!" 
" Load of Garbage","After spending 2 hours in the cinema hall digesting this movie, I had decided not to waste even a single extra minute. But then I thought, a few minutes of mine could save a lot of useful hours of a lot of people. In summary, if you have never seen someone selling domestic garbage packed in a shiny box, this is a prime example. UTV must have spent a fortune marketing this absolute disappointment.I gave 3 to this movie. There are loads of reasons, but almost everything about this movie is really bad. The direction, editing, music, nothing has even a glimmer of hope.Shahid Kapur surely doesn't deserve such a waste of a movie after Jab we Met and Kaminey. Genelia is now the 2nd actress in Bwood who has issues speaking the language. At some point, our directors have to understand that the lead actress has to be more than a pretty face. Most disappointing was Mohnish Behl, who I thought for some reason was trying to be like Annu Malik of Indian Idol.Take my suggestion and avoid." 
" nice one but not great one","the movie was not hyped to start with so we can say its no big deal that it will not be a blockbuster as all the genres don't want to watch it well after seeing the movie one would be satisfied if hes a dancelike because the dance steps and the choreography is top notch although the songs are not as good as one would have liked them to be As far as the acting are concerned shah id was great and genial la was so-so but was looking cute\now other characters of the movie settled in their respective role not perfectly but to an extent of watching them till a point my verdict 6/10" 
" I quite liked the film","I quite liked the film, the best review I read was by subhash jha i recreate below- At one point in this heart warming journey into the life and trials of this Bollywood struggler a kid in the school, where our struggler-hero teaches dancing, wonders how their teacher ji manages to wear such trendy tee-shirts when he lives in a car and has no money for food."Arrey , those are duplicates of branded tee-shirts, you can get them at Rs 150 on the pavement," retorts a know-all kid.That one fleeting moment sums up what Chance Pe Dance strives to squeeze into two-hour of fluid playing-time. The struggle for stardom is done on such a glamorized level of self-actualization so that the audience accepts these liberties for the pleasure of watching good-looking people look presentable in situations where they would otherwise appear unbecoming. On the credit titles we see our struggler-hero prepare for another day of self selling to an unthinking entertainment industry, when one sees a slightly seamless splendour lurking at the heart of this film about a Dilliwallah's struggle to become a star in the Big Bad Bollywood. Clichéd theme? Yup! But sometime some of the most endearing truths of life emerge from situations that work in a direction opposite to the originality. The fact that Shahid plays the struggler helps. It really helps. Here's an enormously watchable actor who can take away the 'acting' from a character and just make you look at what is being said and done on screen without the baggage of his personal life being carried forward. Shahid's character, Samir, in the film is a struggler in all its shades. Samir, has defiantly left for Bollywood while his dad (Parikshat Sahni, endearing) is left wondering why his son needs to be a film hero in the first place (Bollywood). Shahid goes through the predictable grind, but with such extraordinary sincerity and involvement, you suddenly realize the one truth about life's vagaries. Every struggle no matter how similar on the surface is different underneath. Shahid brings out all the shades, nuances and layers in the struggler's inner world without bending the rules of commercial herogiri. This is a far better performance than it outwardly seems. Whether romancing the funny girl-next-door (okay, a few block away)manifesting the disappointments of a struggler who's getting emotionally worn-out waiting for the big moment, or interacting with the kids in school(the director is almost as good with these angels from hell as Shekhar Kapoor in Mr India)Shahid just goes with the flow with a fluidity that goes beyond the dance-floor. Oh, about Shahid's dancing, is there a better dancer in the film industry today? he slim but confident plot moves smoothly on the surface. This one is a rom-com with a pleasing pungent flavour of Mumbai's sorrowful underbelly hidden, but palpable. While Shahid struggles for stardom the narrative glides along at its own even pace seeking out the wannabe star's life as homeless road-dweller who sleeps in his car, and smirks at life's cruelties. There are very few characters in the plot. Satish Shah, Mohnish Behl and Vikas Bhalla who come and go like images seen from a moving train. Director Ken Ghosh keeps the narrative free of complexities beyond the struggler's immediate preoccupations. And that suits the film's moderate temperature just fine. Some moments especially with the kids, exude the warmth like rays of sunshine peeping through a partially open door. Watch the sequence where the kids share their lunch with their famished teacher. Awwwww! Though the choreography is uneven and the climactic dance, a bit of a disappointment, Shahid comfortably keeps us watching the predictable but perky progression of this penniless pilgrim from the backseat of a car to the red-carpet. While giving groovy guru-gyan to his students, our dance teacher, Shahid mentions Michael Jackson , Govinda, Prabhu Deva , Hrithik Roshan and Shiamak Davar among the best dancers. We can easily add Shahid's name to the list." 
" Ken Ghosh wastes his chance.","I finally got round to make the attempt to watch this movie after a long wait. A movie coming from Ken Ghosh, I was not expecting anything exciting. For me it was just another movie that had to be watched. His previous venture 'Fida' was enjoyable. This is his third movie with Shahid Kapoor, so I'm sure that he was hoping that it would work wonders like his previous two movies. Unfortunately due to a weak and routine plot the movie fails to leave an impression. The theme has been repeated in countless movies in the past. This movie had nothing fresh to add to that so the outcome was disatisfying. Yes Ghosh has directing ability. But if he wrote a better script, maybe the movie would have turned out worthwhile. Despite a duration of just 2 hours, the movie seemed to have a slow pace.The attempt to show a guy struggling to become a actor was not convincing. I had seen it all before so it was nothing new. There was also a side plot involving helping some school kids to improve at what they are learning. However that was not integrated well in to the main story. Genelia D Souza is a good actress with a cute face. Though with limited scope she was wasted. I hope that she will be part of better movies in the future. Shahid Kapoor is given another opportunity to display his noddy work and dancing skills. I feel that he is a better dancer than a actor. Lately his acting has become very similar in all his movies. I quiet enjoyed the 'rishta hai mera' picturistaion and the scene when Shahid was crying. Other than that there was nothing much commendable." 
" Very good Movie","Please give this movie a chance. It is really worth watching at least once. Shahid acting is superb. Genelia is looking stunning as always and acting is good too. Please give this movie a chance. Shahid and Genelia have great chemistry in this film. I was surprised that this film would turn out to be this good. Story is really good and its different. Genelia's acting is too good. I think she should do more Hindi films too along with south films. I wish and pray for her that she gets more offers for Hindi films even after marriage and two kids. Shahid has grown in acting really well. He has done superb acting in this film. Please go ahead and give this movie a try, that is all i am asking." 
" i like this movie, i rated it a 9.","Well, the storyline is a little cliché, but they made it quite entertaining. To me, it seems to tell the story of anyone who wants to be an actor whether it is in India or in Los Angeles. It has cute girls and boys. And the dance is good, the music is pumped up with energy.Too bad, not many people have seen it. If this movie was made by Hollywood, it could have been very popular, because it has all the elements.Shahid Kapur doesn't look like those Indians I typically see, he looks like a mix, he could easily be mistaken as Italian, Hispanic, etc. His dance moves are good, he has a nice body. No wonder he is so popular in India.I won't mind watching it again just to see those dance sequences." 
" Juvenile! Grab your ‘chance’ to skip this ‘dance’","Chance Pe Dance is a hackneyed story based on ‘reality shows’, the 'happening' stuff these days. Following the moderately successful “Ishq Vishq” and box office failure “fida”, this is the third of Ken Ghosh – Shahid Kapoor combos. While its budget permitted it to hire stars, it sorely loses out on juvenile script and shabby execution.The story is about Sameer, a Michael Jackson devotee and a starry eyed struggler who fights his budgets by toasting bread with an iron, and has a broken fridge for a cupboard. Then there are failed auditions and dodging the landlord for rent. He nearly lands up with a music video but is displaced by a star-son. In the process though, he gains the smiley Tina (Genelia) a choreographer as his friend.While the movie is themed on Dance and occasionally demonstrates its stuff, lame songs and an underused Shahid make a dumb movie dumber. Impracticality continues and a director who just saw Sameer dance casts him 'hero' in his next flick. But wait, the movie has just started and how can it be so goody-goody already? Then, the predictable happens. His production knocks him off for a talent hunt instead.Till now you just had fun and drama is due to kick-in. A now jobless and homeless Sameer now decides to live in his car. Wait, did I say 'car'? A guy juggling borderline poverty drives around his four wheels! The only silly reason for the car was that the script wanted to have its 'hero' living in a car! It doesn’t end here. He takes up a job teaching school kids to dance while using their bathrooms for ablutions.Trying to reach out to teens, they had to show have some child drama like the kids wining the inter-school dance competition, all due to Shahid. Though clichéd, the scene where his pupils part with their lunch boxes to feed their hungry and penniless teacher is touching. These lows also give an opportunity to the lead couple to show some chemistry, with a little help from Tina’s brother played neatly by Zain Khan.It attempts to include humor, but this Augean mess of a movie leaves you curse your choice of movie. As you endure its painful length and poor editing, you turn into a hapless victim of reality TV drama transferred to a larger screen. Substantiating the accusations of imitating King Khan, Shahid does a 'my mom’s dream’ speech that even touches his rigid father. No prizes for guessing the obvious ending.So, is there anything at all that is worthwhile in this? Barring Genelia’s freshness and some teen stuff, there is nothing. The dances are boring; Shahid retains his Kaminay hairdo and six-pack abs are now passé. Shahid’s forte is about cute looks and dance moves, both of which are untapped fully. So, take my advice, save your time and money; forget that this movie ever released; applies to die hard Shahid fans too!" 
" I'm sure Gia Khan is laughing her butt off right now....","This film is FASHION set to Music and Dance. And Shahid is the Priyanka Chopra(Meghna Mathur) of this film. He talented and it shows and I can only hope that he goes very far with his career but this film was too much hype yet no substance. I could tell within the first five minutes why it wasn't a hit with the movie going audiences around the world (who usually love Shahid) and the casting of Genelia D'Souza in this was a big mistake. She is the same stoic and annoying person in all her films that I've seen thus far and this film is no exception. + Why cast an actress who can't shake a leg in a movie that is obviously about dancing. Wasn't Amrita Rao in town during casting? Even Ayeesha Takia would have done a better job. Better luck next time." 
" It was PATHETIC!!","The movie was really really bad. Before entering the Hall, I knew that the plot would be crap, and I kinda knew the story by just watching the trailers, But all I wanted to see is Shahid's dancing. He didn't quite live up to my expectations. I don't really blame him for this. He was NOT used to his fullest. Genelia was great. I liked her acting and her character. The school part was totally unnecessary. Probably used just to fill some gap or spark a chemistry between Shahid and Genelia.In short, please don't waste your time on this flick. I gave it two stars just because I am a fan of Shahid and I liked Genelia's role. Otherwise, it probably doesn't even deserve one." 
" Chance pe Dance is below par","Chance Pe Dance is only a little over two hours in running time, but feels much longer because the screenplay limps lethargically in no particular direction.Chance Pe Dance is an annoying, exhausting film that entirely fails to entertain. The dance portions here are impressively performed by Shahid Kapoor, but you could interchange each of the sequences and it would make no difference to the final film. Much of the blame for that must by shared by composer Adnan Sami who delivers an uninspired soundtrack of indifferent tunes.Chance Pe Dance doesn't work because you feel no empathy for its protagonist. The film's writers -- if you can call them that, considering there is no script to speak of -- fail to invest even a hint of vulnerability in Sameer. More so, Shahid Kapoor's surface-level performance doesn't help convey the desperation his character's supposedly feeling.The obligatory romantic track between Sameer and an upcoming choreographer (played by Genelia D'souza) is so random, it adds no dimension to the central plot. This is a film without any character arcs, or plot progression. To be honest, Chance Pe Dance is a film that probably started shooting before a script was ever written; a one-line idea that never developed into a complete story."
