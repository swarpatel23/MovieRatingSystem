" The perfect torchbearer of Zom-com in Indian celluloid; Go for it..it's quirky,zany laugh riot..","Centenary year of Indian cinema started on a positive note with different genres being explored & various subjects being applauded by audience. The scenario is perfect to introduce new genres & the film fraternity did not let the opportunity go waste. With "Rise of the zombie" & "Go Goa Gone" Indian audience was introduced to the concept of Zombie. While the dark zombie-origin film "Rise of the zombie" came without any hype, the Go Goa Gone became an instant rage with its wacky promos."Go Goa Gone" is basically a slacker comedy revolving round two friends Luv & Hardik & their frustration with mundane life. Be it girls or respective bosses the need of the hour is a break from the tin & bustle of material existence. When their third room-mate, geeky Bunny, had to go to Goa for an official presentation Luv & Hardik joined in & thus the mad adventure began as the trio attends an under-ground rave party in an isolated island miles away from Goa. Out of the blue, the island became infested with zombies & thus the cat-n-mouse game of survival began."Go Goa Gone" follows the typical linear path of any mainstream zom-com film & the writers (Raj, Dk & Sita Menon) did a commendable job in introducing all the basic rules from the zombie-survival rule book. It is a perfect launch pad for the genre to a large Diaspora who're totally alien to the concept. The quirky slacker comedy gelled well with the narrative & sets the mood. The film is a 2 hour laughter marathon. The director duo (Raj & DK) showed their adroitness in making brilliant wacky dark comic films with "99" & "shor in the city". With "Go Goa Gone" they will surely become a known name amongst those who enjoys the tongue-in-cheek kind of humorous films. The film had been given a graphic novel narrative with intelligently divided into three chapters - "go", "Goa" & "Gone". Within the limited budget director duo successfully established the gore & violence involved with a zombie film & took only 2-3 scenes to establish the ugliness of the Living Dead(s) as they pounce on human body eating every ounce of it till the last flesh. A decade ago majority of the audience would have got repulsed by those visuals but with world cinema penetrating every households I don't think anybody would complain (apart from few weak hearted).The uniformity of film is commendable with sleek editing by Arindam Ghatak. Dan's cinematography is worth mentioning as he translates the whole island into a zombie inflicted territory. Within the comic milieu the fear of unknown lurking somewhere could be felt & the sudden shakiness of camera effortlessly captures the Attack of the Zombies. Along with the pace of the film, the humour has been equally spread throughout the narrative & those are situational thus never looks loud or slapstick. The scenes come alive actuated by hilarious dialogues which bring in a zany flavour to the proceedings (trademark of the director duo). There are many scenes which deserves mention for its execution like the initial scenes revolving around luv & hardik; Luv dumping his two-timing girl friend; their confrontation with Zombies & the confusion as to what those creatures are; Boris explaining the concept of zombies; Hardik being interrogated after having sex with a living dead..etc etc..The make-up & graphics never looked fake which adds on to the credibility. With heads getting popped-up, bloods flowing like red wine, flesh getting ripped-off the effects are realistic enough to get audience approval.Sachin-Jigar's music gels with the mood. "Khoon Chus le" has already become anthem for majority of us who hates to wake up on Monday morning & slog our body to the workplace."Babaji ki Booty" is another gem of a song that reflects the mind of a person when one is "high".The second half might give you a feeling of Dejavu but then majority of zombie survival films moves in this set pattern. Being the first zom-com in Indian cinema the director duo aptly chose the basic concept without making a convoluted plot which might have backfired. There is homage given to iconic zombie film "Night of the Living Dead" to "zombieland" in the second half. The heart of the film reminds you of Edgar Wright's masterpiece "Shaun of the dead".Coming to the end there is also a social message against usage of drugs.The actors were in full form & seem to enjoy the madness of the script. Kunal Khemu as the lecherous "Hardik" is spontaneous & spot on. His energy & comic timing is infectious. Vir Das as confused lover boy "Luv" is flawless. Anand Tiwari as geeky mumma's boy "Bunny" is lovable & he has the cute smile which reflects the innocence in his character. The camaraderie within the boys is superb & that helped bringing in the required madness. Saif as the Russian Mafioso "Boris" is in full form & his accented English is a treat to watch. His dialogues "Let's Keel Ded People" & "Main Delhi se hoon bainchod" have already become a rage amongst the youth. Pooja Gupta looked gorgeous & instilled hotness quotient (and never just an eye-candy) in all boys' team.On the whole GGG is the perfect torchbearer for the zom-com genre in Hindi cinema. Moreover since "Delhi Belly" the audience haven't seen a hilarious smart slacker comedy. GGG seamlessly merged the two concepts (Zombie & Slacker comedy) & made one hell of a mad ride. Go for it - it's a laugh riot.P.S : There is a hint of a sequel & I am looking forward to some more madness in it." 
" Indian Cinema dares to experiment and wins!","It's a rarity for Indian movies to step beyond the conventional(and convenient) love stories and venture into the unknown.'Go Goa Gone' tries that and does a commendable job.You have heard of romcoms,now there is a new genre and it's called 'ZomCom!'.The movie stars Saif Ali Khan,Kunal Khemu,Vir Das and many many zombies.There is good chemistry between the friendly trio of Luv,Hardik and Bunny.There's lot of slapstick humor,plenty of boisterous moments.The trio attend a rave party in Goa where all goes wrong.Thanks to a drug,suddenly zombies are spawning out of the blue and they are hungry for any human they can find.The trio find themselves stranded on an island with zombies all around and no way out.Enter Saif Ali Khan as a Russian mafia Boris.Off late Saif's acting has really transcended to a new level of confidence and this role is an example of that.His character is just so amazing.His dialog delivery with that Russian accent,his intimidating yet adorable looks,his intriguing persona-are all things you will love about him.You get a kick within when he says with that Russian accent- 'I kill dead people'.The rest of the cast has acted pretty good as well and i liked Kunal Khemu's(Hardik) performance.There are plenty of genuinely funny moments.Don't try applying your mind too much or connecting the dots,this one is just meant for fun.Watch it and enjoy!" 
" Might just be the Summer Movie of 2013 you're looking for!","I went in for the opening show expecting just as much as everyone else did from a film which built the hype calling itself the first ZomCom (Zombie Comedy) of Indian cinema, and I felt the movie delivered.The storyline itself is pretty simple with two stoner guys taking a trip to Goa with their socially inept friend where the effects of a new breakout drug go horribly wrong for the partying vacationers. The rest is just classic zombie-killing fun with guns, knives, whatever-comes-handy and more guns! The fun elements come from the rough language used throughout which doesn't try too hard and admirable visual effects. The ending might be predictable for those who have watched a fair share of Apocalypse movies but the film itself was quite fresh for me since it didn't try to shove another love story down the throats of the viewers.The acting was decent and the characters themselves were well-designed for this kind of film. Since it's a ZomCom, you might not get the gore scare you might be looking for. But if you enjoy youth-oriented comedies and are in for the Indian "Shawn of the Dead", this is the movie for you! Go watch it, before it's Gone." 
" Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K Rock again","Coming from the directors of 99 and Shor in the City, both of which have a cult following in different age cinema , Go Goa Gone also does the justice to the tag of Different Cinema.Zombies concept was never used in Bollywood until the forgettable Luke Kenny's "Rise of Zombies" which released last month and went unnoticed.What makes GGG work is the plot with a comic element as the center. Kunal Khemu steals the show with his comic timing.(Praying to God and ending with Jai Hind is what will stay with you even after you leave the Cinema Hall) Vir Das is natural as always. Nice to see Anand Tiwary(Remember Mr. Pappu in Udaan) after a little gap.Confident Debut by Pooja.Saif is full on in his Russian avatar as Borris(Bareessss as he likes to b called in it.)No dull moments in the movie which makes it more of great watch. You will always be giggled by some or the actor by their comic timing.But in the end its still the Dierctor's movie. Raj and DK have stuck to what their previous movies had best in it and thats the comic timing(I am using this word the third time in my review because i seriously feel this is what makes us Raj and Dk's all three movies a gem to watch).Still waiting for my reviews, 10/10" 
" 2 Hour Laughter Marathon!!","The movie is about 3 friends out of those 2 are hardcore junkies, be it booze, weed or anything, they just need an excuse to get high. According to me Kunal Khemu was The Best Among the other actors of the movie, his expressions, comic timing were awesome & maintained a standard, even though the movie does contains some, I guess too many derogatory words, which will be fine with the youth. However don't watch with your parents, you'll be embarrassed.Well the movie is one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen in the past few months. I laughed like hell in the theater Jumped on my seat, threw pop-corn & I wasn't alone, the whole theater went crazy.Sooo just go & enjoy this amazing movie & most of the youths of this generation can relate some of the scenes of the movie with themselves.P.S-- Don't Buy Cold drinks or eatables because the movie is a complete laughter ride & you might choke yourselves while laughing. (just kidding)" 
" Hilariously scary!!!","Long back (actually 2 years back) there was a rumor that Bollywood was on its way to make movies on Zombies. Two unnamed films were heard to be in making. Two years after one movie is already released "Rise of the Zombie" (released and flopped) another released today "GoGoa Gone". The name is wacky and trailers are not that interesting but the songs...the songs were its USP. Remember "Delhi Belly", how its wacky songs created the curiosity around it and turned it into a smash hit?....I hope the same thing clicks for it. Now the main business, the review.Theme: Three friends goes Goa for different reason. Two guys to just chill out and one for office presentation. They join a rave party and things turn bad there. People suddenly start turning into zombies. What now? (Well Zombie movies were always about two things either its a horror or its a comedy. Its a comedy and that's the maximum you need to know about it)Character Development: There is hardly any chance of any character development. And this being a "piece-of-life" movie its unjust to ask any from it too. So, leaving this topic.Direction: Was going through the filmography of both the directors. A very impressive catalog : "Shor in the city", "99" to be mentionable. In case of "Go Goa Gone" I would say they have nailed it. The big hit that everyone waits for is here, they can enjoy the success. Its not easy to make offbeat movies in India specially if you want to make profits too from ticket sales. But I guess this is gonna be hit among young viewers. The direction is very much to the point, gives very less focus to individual characters so less time to commit mistakes. You would get almost 100% dialogs rather any monologue. This ensures a creative input of comic timing and surprise element to audience. Just imagine you won't be seeing Saif doing overacting! That's an achievement on its own! On second thought, actually Saif actually did over the top acting. And that blends to the tone of the movie. Crazy characters! Every single one was created with utmost care and then was given some intelligent lines. The chemistry between Vir Das and Kunal Khemu to be mentioned here for this. Then the intelligent film-making by including inspired scenes from "Zombieland" and "Shaun of the dead". Well, you know what is intelligent here? They not only copied scenes but took a dig on it! Bollywood making fun of Hollywood movies is a remarkable scene for sure. Another intelligent aspect is how they handled Clichés. They touched every Cliché that is related to such zombie flicks and made fun of those. Then they made fun of themselves too. Too many things in a movie?! Yeah and you would enjoy it for these things. Hats off to the director duo. Hope they bring a sequel too.Cinematography: Though the movie takes place in Goa they have cautiously escaped showing the scenery of Goa. That was unnecessary for his movie and it was avoided. Rather collage of a rented room of bachelors, office room and a zombie infested island is well crafted. No special mention here. You get to see just what is there, no artsy-fartsy bullsh1t.Songs and background score: The songs are already popular. Specially "Slowly slowly" and "Khoon choos le". Whacky lyrics along with party themed music. Apt to the mood with movie. Two of the songs are used as title credit scene and end credit scene and others are as background score. The dedicated background score is average though.Editing: The editing is superb till intermission but the movie slows down its pace in the second half and this happens mostly due to lack of ideas in screenplay. Still a very good job.Entertainment value: After a long time laughed out loud in theatre. Full entertainment (provided profanity does not bother you!). Kunal Khemu and Vir Das runs havoc and Saif's crazy Russian accent is fun...trust me!Verdict: Since "Delhi Belly" this is the only movie which can shake the former's stature of intelligent. tongue-in-cheek comedy movie. Beware of profanity though. IF you have problem with profanity, this movie is not for you. Rest all assured you would enjoy for sure." 
" A Horror-Comedy Masterpiece - Right up there with "Shaun of the Dead", "Tucker & Dale vs Evil", "Sundown: The Vampire In Retreat", "Cockneys vs Zombies", and ","Reviewed by Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.5/5 starsI must admit that I'm a hardcore fan of the zombie sub-genre in the pantheon horror movies. So it was exhilarating to watch "Go Goa Gone" in which directors Krishna DK and Raj Nidimoru have taken major strides in introducing zombies to the mainstream Indian audience. While baptizing this all important and long overdue initiation, they have also succeeded in hemming an impeccable, gut-busting horror comedy a well.The film crackles with hilarious dialogs, nail-biting sequences, a fluid plot, a coherent yet energizing narrative arc, zany and madcap encounters ranging from the unpredictable to the completely outrageous, brilliant cinematography, and finally spot-on direction from the first frame to the last. The praiseworthy performances, especially from Saif Ali Khan (surprise, surprise) and Kunal Khemmu, only add to the overall viewing pleasure. Puja Gupta's role definition and her enactment are the perhaps the only minor letdowns in this otherwise brilliantly energizing film, but then again, she does provide great eye-candy. So, perhaps that was how her role was meant to be, so who's complaining.Thank God, that the producers set out to make an adult oriented film and were contended with the 'A' certificate, cause the expletive words, gore, wicked jokes, sexual references, and mild exposure (still nothing compared to those tasteless item numbers), are vital for a film of this ilk to work."Go Goa Gone" will go down in the annals of Indian Cinema as a pioneering film that shall hopefully, allow other filmmakers to explore zanier sub-genres that are already popular in other international film circuits. Not only one of the best Indian horror ever, but one of the best horror comedies ever made, even when compared to its western counterparts. Am absolute delight and complete entertainment for a cognizant adult audience. If you want real entertainment, and want a much-needed break from those myriad nonsensical masala films masquerading in the guise of entertainment, then dash to your nearest movie theater and catch the next show of this delectably wicked gore- fest." 
" AWESOME introduction of a new genre in India","If Illuminati had any reservations while producing this risky film they should be laid to rest.The movie has the right pace and gels well with the youth.The movie is teeming with witty one-liners and comedy sequences.The songs are quite peppy and keep going on in your mind for a long time after watching the movie.The best role is of Kunal Khemu who just steals the show a bit from Vir Das(loved him in Delhi Belly).Pooja Gupta looks hot all the time.Saif's cameo is awesome as pseudo Russian 'BAREES'(Boris).Their antics keep the audience rolling with laughter in major part of the movie.Some of the dialogues are just awesome"Haan Dilli Se Hun Bhainchod","Jungle Ke Beech Main Dumbcharades Thode Na Khelunga"and "I Keeel Ded People".A bit loose ending but isn't ending movies like this the hardest part?.Hint of a sequel? We'll have to wait and see the fate of this one." 
" Go Goa Gone-"Bloody Hilarious"","If you're one of the many people who enjoyed 2011's hit release, "Delhi belly" then you're in for a ride. With a very simple story line, and no unwanted plot twists GO GOA GONE is a laughter riot. All characters do justice to their role. The addition of Saif Ali Khan as Boris is Awesome as a lot of the plot rests on him. Both halves are equally fun, and the storytelling is pretty neat as well..A few things that may disturb some viewers, even though the movie is a ZombieComedy, there isn't as much cringing blood as you might expect, the effects are pretty good for a bollywood movie, but the zombies look more dumb than scary & man eaters. The camera views are also a little annoying, as the shaky cam is a bit overused, and is used to get away with a lot of attack scenes. There's also a part in the movie where on of the characters' dies, but *spoiler* is later bought back, with a very unneeded plot twist, it's zombie movie and few deaths wouldn't hurt.Overall This is the bollywood movie of the year 2013 yet. Don't miss this summer movie! It is "bloody" hilarious.*spoiler alert* There's a hint that there may be a sequel, I really hope Luv & Hardik come back for some more fun next year.!" 
" Great Fun","This movie is such a lot of fun. Probably the happiest i have come out from a theater in a long long time. The jokes are not forced at all and laugh out loud funny because of the great acting by the three friends, specially kunal khemu. The zombies manage to be scary and ridiculous at the same time inducing nervous laughter throughout their screen time. Thankfully the actress is also a good actor, which has become a little rare, since female actors are taken only based on their looks.The music is great. Khoon choosle and babaji ki booty. What more could you want?The characters are endearing and you really care about whether they live or die." 
" Go Goa Gone - A mad ride","Go Goa Gone is Bollywood's first foray into the zombie land.Directed by the duo, Raj-DK of 'Shor in the city' fame, this chronicles the encounters of the trio, Hardik-Luv-Bunny played by Kunal Khemu, Vir Das and Anand Tiwari respectively with the zombies when they are stranded on an island in Goa.The film introduces the three main characters with their irreverent banters which is much reminiscent of the hilarious adult comedy "Delhi Belly".While Bunny seems to be an innocent and workaholic chap,Hardik and Luv are good-for-nothing slackers who piggyback on Bunny in an official trip to Goa.Things take a turn at a rave party when the partygoers turn into flesh-eating zombies under the influence of an exclusive Russian drug.Enter the blondie zombie-killer, Boris(played by Saif Ali Khan)who speaks with a funny Russian accent spiced up with desi tadka !GGG is quirky and boasts of real LOL moments in the first half -Thanks to the natural and well-timed performances from Khemu and Das.Saif gets the notes right and he shines with his punchy dialogues in the extended cameo.It only loses focus in the post interval portions due to incompetent writing.Probably the writers weren't sure about a suitable culmination for this mad-cap comedy.Even though the narrative takes a hit, Saif breathes life into the proceedings.While the guys are in terrific form with their dazzling camaraderie,Luna(played by Puja Gupta) is efficient.Seemingly influenced by the western concept, Raj/DK strike an amazing balance in putting up the story in an Indian context and avoid meandering into the distasteful or abusive territory.Yes, there is plethora of cuss words but the humor smart and is tackled aesthetically..Sachin-Jigar's music is apt and energetic and syncs well with the narrative.Whats interesting to note here is, the film does send an implicit message for today's young facebook generation who are unconsciously becoming symbols of loosening morals, philandering ways and finding heaven under drugs,dopes and drinks.Sad!On the whole, Goa Goa Gone is a bravura attempt by Raj and DK.Youngsters will definitely have a ball watching this mad,mad ,mad ride. Watch it for its sheer novelty." 
" Nice Zombie movie","I've been a zombie movie follower for some time (sometimes unwillingly). This movie obviously breaks ground as far as Bollywood goes - it is a respectable (?) zombie movie.Any respectable camp zombie movie should have the following, IMHO - an unconvincing social message (e.g. Romero's "Dawn of the dead" was a backhanded critique of consumer capitalism and mall crawls, Danny Boyle's "28 days later" against irresponsible experimentation), references to other movies of the same genre (e.g. Shaun of the dead), and some innovative twist or variation.Go Goa Gone scores on all three - it has a (tacked-on) message against drug culture, references to other zombie movies including Shaun of the dead (whose solutions are quickly discarded, since it should be obvious to the gentle viewer that desi/pardesi zombies in Goa are different from desi/British zombies in England), and an enjoyably terrible "solution". Also, good music, which Danny Boyle would concur with.All in all, a respectable attempt!! As a camp horror addict, I am satisfied!! Also, a memorable quote that does not quite reach the heights of "When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth" - it goes: "What do we know? What have we learned?"" 
" Bollywood to next level","I was wondering can Indian cinema do justice with zombie movies. And the answer is yes they did. There are so many nail biting moments with a lot of funny dialog. the movie goes with the good pace. Seriously i was not expecting what i have seen in that in a good way. Drugs and zombie what a combination. All the character did justice with their role. The concept was totally zombie, dialog was well written. One thing i can say only a zombie fan can direct this movie. Saif Ali was superb other actors were also good. Action sequence with a little comedy every thing was in perfect combination. I don't want to spoil the movie watcher what i can say is perfect start with a perfect end. i will defiantly recommend this movie to everybody specially if you are zombie fan. Watch this and join the party." 
" Go Goa Gone is a refreshing change from your typical Bollywood mediocrity.","Go Goa Gone is a pretty good movie for the first of its kind in Bollywood. Apart from your typical Bollywood annoyances this movie was quite entertaining. Granted my opinion on this is fairly biased given my love for Zombie flicks, however I believe it stands on its own. The movie borrowed ideas from Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead that were easily recognizable and familiar; although nowhere as blatantly as many other Bollywood movie. Also, the setting of the movie felt eerily like the video game: Dead Island. Few scenes felt like they were exactly the same as some missions in the game.The overall acting was good and the jokes were smart and stuck for most parts, some more than others. The chemistry between the three protagonists, and overall cast was spot on. Saif Ali Khan's pseudo Russian Mafioso was an entertaining gag when originally introduced but it got a little old and drabby after a while. The female lead in the movie was underused and felt like a background character, other than being your prototypical Bollywood 'Damsel in distress'. The plot is very simple (like any other zombie movie) and can be easily figured out. The movie follows a very typical zombie flick formula: Intro to the main character, putting them in a setting of zombies, explaining the origin of zombies (little lacklustre in this move), figuring out how to fight and kill zombies, the lack of ability to shoot the zombies and mastering the headshot by the end of the movie, and so on. This movie is as original as any zombie movie can get. Every scene of the movie was fairly predictable. Not to say that this is a bad thing, all zombie movies are alike. It's the chemistry between the characters that really separate the greats from the rest. As liner as this movie was, the surprising anecdote about zombies which was cheesier than the cheesiest cheese cake, felt original. I laughed out loud several times during the movie; admittedly the humor was along the lines of 3 Idiots and Delhi Belly i.e. buddy movies with a lot of raunch.The movie was 1 hour and 48 minutes in length, which is a little long for a movie of this sort. 1 hour and 30 to 40 minutes max would be ideal for a zombie flick. It's hard to keep the audience immersed. The jokes get lazy and pushy and the situations where protagonist has to escape the zombie hoards get nuttier and nuttier to the point of complete disbelief My biggest complaint against this movie is its anti-smoking campaign.It's almost ridiculous to see an anti-smoking campaign in a movie about pot-smoking booze hounds itching for parties that feature Mary Jane. There was an abundance of smoking scenes that featured small messages warning against smoking. It's almost like the NRA running ads that featured gun-related killings and having messages popping up simultaneously that say "Don't shoot people in the face. Shooting people in the face is bad." I understand that the movie means well and doesn't want to glamorize smoking, but omitting smoking altogether from the movie would be more effective anti-smoking rhetoric than a miniscule, meaningless and insincere insulting sign at the bottom of the screen.Overall though, I would recommend this movie to any zombie fans out there. If you're not a fan of Bollywood but enjoy zombies it's still worth the watch. The nod to Bollywood cheesiness near the end of the movie was worth the price all on its own.There were obvious "Are you serious? He would totally get bitten in that situation." type of scenes and the anti-smoking messages were very annoying. However, they are forgivable because it's Bollywood's first attempt at the genre and from the looks of it they have done a good job." 
" Babaji Ki Booti...Sure to take you on a high ride...","A Hindi Zom-Com...does that excite you...I don't think so...!!! we have seen quite a few Hollywood movies on the same concept & I would think 'Zombieland' stands out . Nothing was much expected from the movie...till the movie starts.. 3 friends...f****d up life..job..love..from every aspect...most of us can relate to the plot..;p There ain't much storyline, but what made this movie special was Vir Das & Kunal Khemu's performance & their flawless comic timing.. The dialog writing is amazing and you cannot just stop laughing for the most part of the movie...& mind you,most of the lines will leave you awestruck as in, you wont believe that you heard something you just did in a Hindi Movie... This movie has certainly taken the comic level to a different level..(Good or bad, its certainly debatable).. Therefore, the movie is to be watched with your friends and not your family.. Anand Tiwari,the 3rd friend as Bunny, is really hilarious in his own peculiar way..the same goes for Saif Ali Khan..he is funny with his Russian accent though he remains serious throughout concentrating on killing dead people... You may find the last 20 minutes of the movie not so good but its OK i guess...the end may look as if forced upon but it can easily be given a skip considering the joyride provided throughout. All in all...a great movie to watch..not to be missed.. Thumbs up for "Babaji Ki Booti"... :)" 
" best bollywood horror-comedy movie","The make-up & graphics never looked fake which adds on to the credibility. With heads getting popped-up, bloods flowing like red wine, flesh getting ripped-off the effects are realistic enough to get audience approval.Sachin-Jigar's music gels with the mood.

GGG seamlessly merged the two concepts (Zombie & Slacker comedy) & made one hell of a mad ride. Go for it – you will laugh throughout & get distresses. There is a hint of a sequel & I am looking forward to some more madness in it."
