" not a Satya nor a Sarkar more Vaastav","This move surfaced when Vastaav became popular and many underworld films began to churn out of Bollywood . we have Achank Deo who played a Gunda in Phool Aur Angaar and was a rival stepbrother of Ajay Devgan in Gair.It begins in a small village were our hero is mistreated by the school master for being poor this inflames him and education and school hold no importance for him ,the movie then fast forwards to when Achank is selling black cinema tickets .it his here were he first has a confrontation with the local police officer this enimaty carries on till the end of the film . our hero also has a childhood friend who,s aim is to become a powerful mantri and is always shown to be resideing among Raaj Niti members .Achank Deo catches the eyes of a local gangster and agrees to work as a hit-man for him carrying out various suparis/contract killings , and becoming very popular with the press and the police for the wrong reasons. Achank Deos character may not be as confident as Vastaav,s Raghu nor as full of himself as Companys Chandu as he is hummilated in front of the whole city dragged naked in the streets were he once ruled and by the end of the movie we witness a Vaastav encounters as Achank Deos friends are systematicaley eradicated by the C.B.I and police using fake encounters .Now alone and wounded by an unseen foe Achank Deo staggers bleeding from a gaping wound tired and batterd he stumbles and lands in a garbage container were he struggles to breath as he hears the cheering of a crowd passing by. The cheering is for non other than his childhood friend who,s celebrating of his mantri dream come true by having all ties cut with the underworld andgetting rid of Achank Deo he can rule the city .Not a finger can point to him or link him to the underworld.With the last gasps still coming out of Achank Deos mouth ,as the blood trickles down his stomach, a stray dog urinates on the dying gangster who was king of the city at one time"
