" Mumbai's Underbelly seen like never before.","In the midst of writing my first screenplay, I was keenly observing reviews from my close ones about the movies they liked and disliked and the reasons for them. I acquainted myself to the grim reality that people still don't want to see something real on the silver screen. Movies are a getaway from reality and there is this unanimous love for their stars. That's why our movies are about glamor, glitz and almost always no impressive storyline. Aamir is fantastically different to the clichéd movie world, we live in India. Cinematography reminiscent of the great Nicolas Roeg's lens work, Alphonse Roy is the hot new talent to watch out for. He managed something that a lot of movies based in Mumbai could not...the only notable exceptions being Slumdog Millionaire and Salaam Bombay. It has a gripping plot and keeps you edgy but isn't devoid of a few Muslim stereotypes. That said, there are a whole lot of other pluses which make it a must watch. Rajeev Khandelwal looks dapper, plays his character and displays angst, fear and horror with great facial precision and makes you wonder why he has not been casted in another movie yet, are we all sleeping or are we just too obsessed with our stars? Editing is first rate, direction has a sense of purpose and the whole ensemble of actors plying their trade meaningfully gives Aamir a definite must watch tag. What is lacks is the finesse of an Anurag Kashyap screenplay, but still is a valiant attempt in trying to change the face of cinema in India. Aamir should be lauded, applauded and celebrated as one of the best, coming out from Bollywood factory in the year 2008." 
" Some day we will grow up and appreciate such films..someday","I for one found the negative comments about this film really in bad taste. Guys if u are into typical Bombay cinema pelvic thrust versus mega wedding ...you haven't seen even 1% of what cinema is. Rubbishing Aamir is like proclaiming to the world that Caviar is not edible because you have been brought up on the highly nutritious burger. Or like proclaiming that since you are used to "Desi" ..champagne is as good as salt water.Aamir is one of the best films I have seen of late . And I am writing this review immediately after seeing it. Its a dark and grimy narrative that is at once gripping without being frivolous. It makes no bones about the fact as to the aim of the director...A short gripping sequence ..thats it. And what a development of story line. Amazing . Nothing short of it. Starting from the much raved cinematography to the subdued expressions ...its a winner all the way.As to the philosophical argument that portrays followers of a particular sect as accomplices to terrorist crimes. ...It might be politically correct to tow the "secular" line but we all know deep inside us what exactly is happening. Just wished we had more such characters in this world who can say that a religion develops when an individual develops...." 
" Ultimate debut for everybody, very good movie","You might have seen many good Bollywood movies but I am sure you surely haven't seen something like this. Most of Bollywood cinema almost always is all about glamor, fancy locations, item numbers and typical love stories. This is one of the very few movies which stick to reality and dare to be different than other. Prepare yourself to see the dark side of Mumbai unlike the glamors side of it you might have seen it in most of other movies. I will not tell anything about the plot because the less you know about it the more you will enjoy the movie.It will surely pull you in the shoes of the lead character from the very first scene. Background score and music is just perfect with the theme of the movie. This is a debut movie for most of the cast and crew surely most amazing debut in Bollywood after a very very long time.This surely is best of this year, don't miss this one." 
" History Repeats Itself Like S.R.K in Circus & Rajiv In as Aamir","A Masterpiece showing a reality of old Bombay at present, a small budget movie with great significant of present issues photography was excellent by Alphonso Roy, A great effort from rising star of film industry"Rajiv Khandelwal" sure he'll going to have rocking future like S.R.K. If we put ourselves in the character then we will realize the psychology of the maker & excellent story with a power punch to think Aamir=Leader title is perfect beyond the politics Watch it at any cost. the life of the people in Mumbai-3 is being well portrayed the locations were all real no sets at all. filming was done in a short period of time" 
" Aamir means leader... did you know...???","You would want to stand up and applaud when the end credits roll, for this will be easily one of the finest films you have seen in recent times. And it becomes all the more commendable considering the fact that most of the names in the credits are debutants, including the lead protagonist and director.Debutant director Raj Kumar Gupta dares to tread the path less travelled with a dark, hard hitting drama thriller. The film starts with some candid shots of Mumbai and the candid shot keep flooding showing the unknown and dark side of Mumbai. The director and the cinematographer grip you to your seat for entire duration. You feel as suffocated as the lead protagonist. And when he beats the hell out of some road side snatchers, exhausting all his anger and frustration, you wish you could also hit a few blows to help him. And to add to the class of the director and innovation of cinematographer, there is impeccable background score.Rajiv Khandelwal, probably the most precious Bollywood import from television and best debutant this year, showcases the character that is traumatized, shocked, feared, determined, strong, venerable all at the same time. He shows what he is capable of. We only hope he is nurtured and used well in Bollywood, for he is a talent to look out for.Looking at the kind of cinema that's being churned out these days, you'll have to wait probably really long to watch a film of this stature. So, don't wait. Don't miss this one. For this really deserves to be stand and applauded." 
" One of the Best !!!!","How often we come across a movie which forces us to see inside our-self even before we start criticizing others. Aamir does this in the knock-out style. Brilliant Acting, awesome camera work, tight script, haunting background, extreme locations (even i would not dare to go in daylight) and message for all. This film showcases what we have become off late in the name of fighting terrorism. Religion cannot be criteria for judging a person. Portrays the Grim realities and dilemma of a modern young Muslim who are often torn apart in the name of religion and love for their country. One of the best movies which do not screams about patriotism but shows it's our inner self which defines what person we are not our race." 
" Bollywood beyond imagination","I don't have enough words to express my feelings about this movie. Never before in Hindi cinema, anyone has made such a thriller (without introducing any ghosts).Brilliant direction, story, camera work, background music is far beyond expectation, special credit goes to director for choosing such real life locations during shooting. No rush of characters, no additional drama..... simply the director has filled everything up to the brim perfectly. Excellent acting by Amir, I can't remember his name, probably Rajiv.....congrats man, you can expect "critics" award next year, some of the incidents in the story are almost our common life experiences like the custom officer matter.Overall, it is simply a masterpiece. I don't know whether people in India will get to know about the movie or not ?? Last year such an unexpected movie came out "Jhony Gaddar" but this one is far better than that dealing with a real life story from different angles." 
" thriller that will keep you guessing all the way!","The TV star Rajeev Khandelwal makes an impressive movie debut with this one. The movie is a thriller which will keep you guessing all the way. We have seen similar thrillers like cellular or phone booth but this ones shows an entirely different scenario.An Indian doctor on returning from London founds himself in precarious circumstances where his family is kidnapped and he is made to run around the city by goons. Its a simple story but told very effectively. The movie's impressive direction, editing and performances make sure that it never looses the pace.The movie packs a punch and will be worth your money and time." 
" An open ended question","A calorie free movie which sans the "phormoola" (the must-have superstitious ingredient for every Bollywood movie).Aamir rests heavily on the technical department and needless to say it is rock solid, hence works big time. The concept is innovative, story is engrossing, screenplay is deft, music is captivating and of course direction is first rate. And above all, if the performances would have even fallen short by a degree  it would have been a fly in the ointment. Kudos to all the new faces, Rajeev Khandelwal deserves a special mention (and so does the lady who plays the hooker).The director spares no moments to gets straight down to business and you get sucked into the whirl hole. The choice of locales deserves a special mention  very realistic and add the background score to it, you almost feel it is virtual reality you are experiencing.Somewhere in between, you get déjà vu as though the entire plot is a bad prank (Bluffmaster/ The Game)  but eventually it dawns that the funny bone does not exist.And ah yes  the ending couldn't have been better! As the credit rolls, you will be enlightened with a few answers.... and left with barrage of questions." 
" Fine Work","What happens when a director is in full control of his craft, his crew and his subject? You get an unexpected wonder like Aamir. Nevermind that it is built on a shoe-string budget, has a low profile cast and hardly had any publicity-spend.The screenplay is brilliant. It is built piece by piece to create riveting drama. The camera work is raw and real. The locations are actual Mumbai mean streets and alleys. The supporting cast is very real. It is like Rajeev Khandelwal is walking through a real day in his life. Ah yes, Rajeev Khandelwal ! He is plain amazing. The character he plays is in a turmoil - vulnerable, helpless, frustrated, tired and angry. But Rajeev Khandelwal - he is just effortless. Easily the best performance of the year so far.Raj Kumar Gupta makes a fine directorial debut. He does not fall into the clichés that a newcomer may be susceptible to. It would have been an easy choice to shoot the story in a dark night instead of the broad daylight that Gupta chose. He chose not to hide in darkness. He throws his craft open in blinding sunlight. Instead of a la-Hollywood film-noir style, he places his drama-thriller in the dusty Indian landscape.Of course, there are overtures of terrorism and disillusionment of a community but these are not the highlights of the film. And thankfully, the film does not editorialize. It is basically a drama-thriller - and a good one.There is excellent use of slow motion in the climax. It makes it the edge-of-the-seat moments of the film. Best film of this summer !" 
" The anti-thesis of a jehadi","I had heard a lot about this movie. But somehow, never got around to seeing it. And what a time to watch it too! After having seen an interesting version of Mumbai in 'Slumdog Millionaire', here was yet another version of watching Mumbai bare itself unashamedly. What got me even more curious was that the whole crew of 'Aamir' was practically unknown and given the rave reviews it had been getting, I decided to take a chance. And boy! Am I glad I did!'Aamir' is a story of Dr. Aamir Ali who returns from London to his home in Mumbai only to find that someone has kidnapped his entire family. All he has are clues given by an unknown face and cellular phone cues that take him to a mirage of places that are simmering with lower middle class Muslims. He finds himself face to face with a society he had never seen before yet all the time doing what he is being told in order to save his family. At the end of the day he finds himself sitting on a bus with a suitcase that he has been told contains a bomb. He is then told to get off the bus at the next traffic light leaving the suitcase behind.This is as far as I want to tell you since the final few minutes of the movie are a revelation. I wouldn't go as far as to say I was completely taken aback by it or wasn't expecting it to happen, but the conviction with which a normal regular common man steps from those shadows of cowardice and attempts to personify his name 'Aamir' – a leader – was what I found most endearing. For a first time director, Raj Kumar Gupta surely treads a risky path as he tackles a burning issue in India head on. He enforces the ideologies that are so often taken for granted and makes the protagonist finally attempt the perfect antithesis of terror and a terrorist.I must say, it was quite a show. The movie albeit, is slow in parts and could have used some faster reactions from the leading man and some chop offs here and there, but these are trivialities when compared to the message the movie attempts to send across. I recommend everyone to watch 'Aamir', as such 'in the face' almost surreal seeming plots very rarely make for a good viewing." 
" brilliant movie","This movie is a must watch... its a beautiful, it short and absolutely no nonsense..... brilliant pace and beautiful camera work... although its "inspired" from a Filipino movie Aamir is well directed by debut director Rajkumar Gupta ..Your heart goes out to Aamir Ali and what he is been put through... and in a country like ours and the differences we have it gives you a whole new perspective on society and its pressures.. but how an ordinary man makes takes a stand.....Another good point of the movie is real locations.. no artificial sets .... the camera works its self well through the streets of Mumbaithis movie is a good movie and a must see" 
" Good effort but a lil Drag","The movie concept was good . Rajeev's acting was good too but had flaws at so many places like when he runs behind the taxi , its like he working out and getting tired there no concern in his face . And for most of the shots he has the same expression , even in a scene where he is is supposed to be happy he is just normal . The script is small and has been stretched. The only story is in the middle and the end . after half the movie you can simply forward it to the end . In all a good debut for RK but the direction could have been stronger to get more expressions on Rajeev's face except fatigue . He could have shown more concern , sadness, confusion , anger ... Well but looks like a lot of effort has been put in though to make the movie and kudos to that :-)." 
" It must win an award.","The movie really proved to be an "Eye Opener".The places shown really depicts the condition of people living miserably with/without knowing it.Aamir's character of a non-discriminating individual was nicely portrayed. Amazing acting by Rajeev. Man, I liked his acting since "Kahin To Hoga". His role in "Left-Right-Left".The end left me with mixed emotions. There was a bitter feeling about the reporters' Terrorist Coverage's statements.The movie did make an impact. At least for people like me (with Amir's Thinking). It deserves an award. "Piece of work"." 
" An excellent unique plot of patriotism.","I really wasn't expecting much, other than a few Action sequences and chasing scenes, which would have been OK for a low budget movie. But Aamir exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The acting are really good, esp Rajeev Khandelwal and the prostitute. No one can expect this wonderful direction from a debut director. The Plot is very rich with the colors of typical Mumbai city. A testament to this fact is that almost the whole crowd stayed for the end credits. This is a very rare occurrence nowadays.Really, A fine piece of work." 
" Pointless","I am surprised to be the only dissenter among an overwhelming majority of positive reviews for "Aamir". I do not fancy myself as a non-lover of serious cinema and I am all for experimentation with the craft-- be it theater, cinema or comics! "Aamir" failed to make the cut in my book, in terms of being *good* cinema.***Probable Spoilers*** The best way to enjoy this movie is to not know ANYTHING about it at all. The slightest hints can be a spoiler because the best things about this movie are the beautiful location shots (how lovely they make Mumbai look on screen nowadays, starting with the adorable "Taxi No.9211" montage) and the starkly non-bollywood treatment. Very gritty, very real and extremely under-played. Not an iota of gratuitous action or superfluous plot-points. For these two alone, it could score a 10/10.On the other hand, I give it a 2/10. There are three main reasons: 1. The film progresses like a thriller, throwing surprises and giving hints. One usually expects such cinema to culminate in some sort of "revelation". Such thrillers also beg a "motive" and a secret someone who was leading the hero all along. In "Aamir", the first 5 minutes give a feel of what the sinister shadow wants. The plot ("Using amateurs to carry out terrorist/assassination jobs and then eliminating them to leave a cold trail") has been done to death in Sanjay Dutt's movies. Money or threat to family are about the only two means of inducting these recruits. Given that, I was surprised that RK Gupta expected *THIS* revelation to be the "Aha!" moment in the climax. Worse, there was no other "Aha" moment, this was it.2. For a thriller, the pace was excruciatingly slow. I guess RKG wanted us to feel the characters frustration and helplessness as time moved slowly but surely towards his family's doom. Even then, I would expect a man in a hurry to not pause and ponder before delivering every dialog, before making every gesture. Again, the slow build-up did not lead to a satisfying closure.3. My final grouse is I failed to see the point of the writer. Did no one notice the number of people in diverse professions that seemed to be aware and implicit accessories in the act? To me, the story reinforced rather than negated the suspicion that many seemingly everyday Muslims are secret sympathizers to the terrorist cause. If everyone was in on it, how difficult would it be to entrap another innocent man to commit yet another bombing another day? For all the right intentions, "Aamir" fails both in its exposure of society's prejudice in judging a whole community for the isolated acts of a few-- as well in becoming a taut, entertaining cinema. A single man's sacrifice in a story that envelops many thousands, in my opinion, has a hollow ring to it.While the "it takes ONE to start a MOVEMENT" theme is pretty cool, it stays rather diluted in "Aamir". This belongs to the genre that believes serious cinema equals obscure but all worked-up cinema."
