" B&B worth a "Look-See"","Let me preface my comments with this disclaimer, I am a nonIndian. Forgive my obvious ignorance and any misspellings, and proceed at your own risk.I rented B&B from Netflix because I've seen KHAKEE with Bachchan. the father and Ash Rai, plus KUCH NAA KAHE WITH Bachchan, the son and, again, Ash Rai. The father is obviously an national Indian treasure as a wonderful, serious actor. The son is clearly a gifted comedian and maturing, sensitive actor. Ash Rai? She's one of a kind too, and she clearly knows how to pick 'em in her leading men. By the way, Ajay Devron, her leading man in Straight From the Heart, Raincoat, and as that nefarious terrorist in KHAKEE, is another example of her very good taste in who appears opposite her on screen.B$B is delightful especially for Bachchan the son, who did great work here in various con man roles and in his interaction with his perky, little costar, Rani Munkerjee. Of course, the whole thing is a bit of fluff from beginning to end, and anyone who expects more, should leave as soon the first energetic musical number hits the screen.The narration by Bachchan, the father and his eventual, inevitable appearance as the world-weary cop chasing these carefree, con kids is worth the wait. Of course, it is just like every other American cops 'n robber spoof that I've ever seen; nobody really gets hurt.Now the surprise and joy for me was the so-called 'item number' in the bar with father, son, and their co-star from other recent movies, Ash Rai. The drunken banter (no, I don't speak Hindi and had to rely on the subtitles) and body language was very funny to me despite, or maybe because of, this obvious handicap. Their interactions with Ash prior to the dance number were perfectly timed comedy reactions too. The dance number itself ripped up the place and Ash looked as if she was having a lot of fun "flirting" with two of her favorite men. Now that's entertainment in my book, and in any language.Go rent B&B, or, even better, buy the DVD and add it to your Bollywood collection. That's what I'm doing right after I finish this review. Thanks to both Bachchans, Ms. Munkerjee and Rai for sharing their talents with all of us." 
" A joy ride.","Leave your rational back at home and when you come out of the theater you leave the place smiling. Shaad Ali did a marvelous job of capturing the beauty and essence of North India. The story is not a ground breaking one and have been used before but it is the treatment and screenplay which makes it so enjoyable. The movie has got it all groovy North Indian dance steps, dancing on the train selling of Taj Mahal.BAB is about two dreamers from small towns of UP Rakesh ( Abhishek Bachchan ) and Vimmi (Rani) who in the quest to fulfill their dreams elope from house and bump into each other. They both faces failure at the first stage so they both decide to twist things around and get into conning. To con they develop an alter -ego Bunty and Babli. from then they never face failure and their scams become a headache for the system.DCP Dashrath Singh Amitabh Bachchan takes the charge of catching B n B.SHaad ALi poured a lot of hard work to make BAB a treat to watch . His home work is obvious from many small points in the movie. THe opening scene of a Kite stuck in a TV antenna , the songs which are played in the background were just sheer right on the target. Songs like " CHalat Musafir " really captured the feel of North India. Using Taj Mahal as a backdrop for the marriage and their unconventional Vows were all brilliant.Performance wise Rani Mukherjee is absolutely awesome. The way she captured the emotions her get up and talking style of a young Punjabi girl was point perfect.Amitabh Bachchan's comedy is still the best my god what timing. Abhishek Bachchan has seriously grown up as an actor and he proves his point in BnB .Abhishek and Rani are a treat to watch and they were so lively on the screen it gets you into the moment. The bus scenes where Rakesh tells Vimmi about BNB is amazing then the scene on Mumabi CST station where they confess their love shows their on screen chemistry.SEL gives a good enough soundtrack with songs like "Dhadhak Dhadhak" and Chup Chup Ke the soundtrack of the movie is really worth listening. Aishwarya Rai looks amazing on screen and Amitabh and Abhishek were marvelous together. The Bar scene between Abhishek and Amitabh is all about brilliant timing of comedy. I loved the groovy dance steps of Kajrare.In times when movies like Kya Kool Hain Hum is making money BnB comes as a refreshing good taste comedy . 8/10" 
" Surprisingly good Indian comedy","When I think of comedy in bollywood, I think of Govinda, who I detest. Fortunately for me, Abhishek and Rani were the stars of this light hearted and fun film. The first 20-30 minutes of the movie are a bit slow and could have been constructed better to develop the characters. However, after the brief introduction to each, the audience is quickly taken on a ride with the duo, Bunty and Babli, as they travel from city to city cheating people out of their money. Abhishek does a terrific job as Bunty and of course Rani is perfect as his accomplice, Babli. The film has enough laughs to last through to the very end. Even Amitabh, the veteran Indian actor, is comedic in his role as the police officer chasing the two. Aishwarya's dance number was a pleasant addition to the film. Some of the songs seemed to drag on for one too many minutes. In short, Bunty Aur Babli is a refreshing and fun experience worth watching." 
" A refreshing change","I can slowly see Hindi films evolving and taking more chances with their content and characters, something it hasn't done in thirty years. With the release of films like Black, Hazaaron Kwaishein Aisi, Raincoat and now even Bunty Aur Babli you can't help but appreciate the effort, even if the results vary.Bunty Aur Babli is in no way a breakthrough. It has its color, loud music and spoonfuls of melodrama like the thousands of Hindi films that preceded it. However, it also has a pair of anti-heroes as the leads; Bunty and Babli are lovable criminals that love crime. The sheer exuberance of the characters as well as the actors is one of the main selling points of this film.The music is likable, though the shooting of Chup Chup Ke looks exactly like that of the song "Saathiya" from Shaad Ali's previous film. It could have been removed. The item number with Aishwarya Rai is practically forced into the screenplay with a pair of pliers, and could also have been removed.The movie also unnecessarily milks a scene between Amitabh Bachchan and his son, Abhishek. The two get completely drunk and have a boring, drawn out conversation about love that may leave you squirming in your seat. What a waste. This was meant to be a mesmerizing scene, as it's their first time acting together, but it instead becomes a good time to take that bathroom break.However, those gripes are minor compared to the rest of the film. Abhishek Bachchan gives a good performance, and hams it up like a pro. Rani Mukherjee is further cementing her stature as one of the few true actors in commercial Hindi cinema. She handles the humor (check out her catty fight with a Miss India contestant) and the melodrama with ease. Amitabh Bachchan is a cool cat. All of it works well because no one is taking it too seriously. It's pure entertainment.All in all, I'm glad we're seeing popular films that shy away from the love triangles, characters that are too perfect to be human, and poor production values. Bunty Aur Babli falls into none of those traps. Yes, it falls into several others but it's still a step forward!" 
" Good, but not great","Bunty aur Babli goes in the 'good but not great' category. You can probably watch it once and even get entertained but thats about it. First, the three good things about this movie are : Abhishek Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan :D. Jokes apart, this movie is a perfect example of a great cast holding up a weak storyline. It starts of well with the one hummable song of the entire movie and pretty shots of North India. It picks up tempo as 'Bunty' and 'Babli' meet and embark on their modus operandi, but quickly loses out on account of a string of forgettable songs and sloppy editing. Rani's vivacious attitude, her colorful Kurtis, the plan to lease out the Taj Mahal, and the encounters between Amitabh and Abhishek, Rani's Punjabi accent and Amitabh Bachchan's dialog delivery are great. The songs, the 'item' number, the occasional sentimental scene between Rani and Abhishek are awful. Overall, a 6/10. The movie had the potential to be something great but I think the director lacks the insight and experience to achieve it." 
" Excellent score! excellent movie!","It was a refreshing to listen to Bunty aur Bubly music. I could feel my roots reaching out for me. "Kimam Ki khushboo hai..." touch of class! Go on Shaad! I am not only impressed by the cinematic genius of the young director but also by his deep understanding of the Indian popular culture Abhishek-Rani look very good together I hope we see more of the together. Amitabh is cool he is the coolest main man in Bollywood. The ease at which he adapts to his roles is phenomenal. Indian musicals are getting better day by day and BNB is no exception. Bollywood coming to age and its good to see.I hope to see more of Shaad movies in years to come and wish him best of luck." 
" Hilarious comedy caper!","Abhishek and Rani team up as partners in crime as they try to steal all of India's money in this hilarious movie! Starting out as two innocent souls fed up of the small-town life, the two run away in hopes of fulfilling their big dreams of fame and fortune. After running into too many road blocks, they try to go the easy way out by, well, stealing. They never run out of ideas to fool people. The best and most creative scene is the one with the Taj Mahal! Both Abhishek and Rani give a great performance. All the songs are great be it Chupke Se or Dhadak Dhadak. This movie features the king of item numbers with the Bachchans and the mesmerizing Aishwarya in Kajra Re. She finally does an entertaining role, be it just a song, after all her serious films like Raincoat and Chokher Bali. Coming from U.P. and being intimately familiar with some of the filming locations, I took full delight in watching this movie! Amitabh, of course, is excellent. His music video is fantastic. Just when you think you've laughed all you could, Amitabh makes sure his rapping skills leave your eyes watering!" 
" Welcome aboard! A joyride awaits you!","I went to see the movie on Friday- house full, Saturday- house full, and it went on till I reached a point of absolutely no hope left in life. Then I decided to step inside a shady old haunted theater and finally see the movie I was so eagerly waiting for all these days. I knew I loved the movie from the word go! And I had expected that but then I had expected a lot of senseless humor too, which I never found. All I got was vintage bollywood stuff, something that we, proudly, do best. Now this is the stuff great movies are made of. What stuff? Let me address that- quintessential India, the rustic, real, romantic, carefree, unpredictable India that you never get to see in the otherwise high- brow flicks. The entire movie is picture perfect from start to finish. I am very sure the DVD is gonna be a rage when it comes. The popular aspects of the movie have already been discussed, so I would want to mention the finer ones. If one watches the movie closely, one sees traces of Maniratnam- the mist and the melody, the suspense, the vacuums felt at a lonely railway station with the smoke accompanying the restlessness. This tells where Shaad Ali Saigal comes from- the best school of cinema in the country. There are some movies that you tend to revisit in your thoughts very often. B n B is one of them for sure. It goes far beyond what a normal light romantic comedy would like to achieve, and it accomplishes a cult status of its own in unique ways. People like Kunal Kohli, who think Hum Tum was the bible of the bollywood romantic comedy genre, may pick up a lesson or two from here, if they still have some sensibility left with them. A special mention for the brilliant camera work that makes you feel you are a part of the roller coaster journey through all those lovely locales, and the infectious music that refuses to leave your mind far after it has left your car stereo. And who can miss to mention the impeccable timing of Abhishek. If Yuva was coming of age movie for him, he roars like a king in this one, and rips all the criticism apart, in the rock solid screen presence and the fearless stare at the camera. Way to go, Abhishek! You see him and Rani, and you feel like "where were they all this time when all we were subjected to in the name of comedy was something that sounds real smelly!" Big B cant be missed out from this comic caper either. Play on!! There is one Bubli and thats for sure!" 
" True Bollywood style.....","Bunty aur Babli has all the ingredients of a blockbuster - impressive starcast, novel story, mind-blowing music, sizzling on-screen chemistry and to top it all, an item song that is well set to be a nation's new anthem.After a successful debut with Vivek Oberoi-Rani Mukherjee starrer Saathiya, Shaad Ali is back with yet another great movie. Of course, it may disappoint all those craving for Hollywood-like cinema (Black, Page 3 , etc.) - Bunty aur Babli is 100% Indian - textbook Bollywood style. So, you have Abhishek Bachan and Rani Mukherjee playing two ambitious, fortune-seeking small-town youngsters, who run away from their families to make it big in bad Mumbai. The duo turn into formidable con-pair thus inviting upon themselves the wrath of a UP-bhaiyya type cop (Amitabh Bachan). The film's initial half is much like a roller-coaster ride while it is the later half that involves the Big B chasing the masquerading duo. Finally, the product is a movie providing wholesome family entertainment in typical Bollywood flavour. The ending may appear a bit damp, but all-in-all its a movie worth seeing.ACTING: Abhishek Bachan is fast growing out of his illustrious father's shadow and carving a niche for himself. AB is fantastic in the film as the trickster Bunty. Rani Mukherjee on the other hand is fast rising to be the next 'actress of an era' after Madhuri Dixit. she is turning out to be the industry's biggest goldminer with a string of 5 recent successes already to her name. After a serious role in Black, Rani enthralls all by another great performance in a contrary role. The Big B as usual stamps the film with his quality and it is quite useless to praise him here. And last but far from the least is Aishwarya Rai.............it can only be Ash who can floor the audience and leave her mark on a film featuring three of Bollywood's biggest names in a role comprising just of a 7-minute item song. The gorgeous body, the heaving breasts, the backless choli, the tempting face ,the hypnotising eyes and of course the drooling dance moves - Ash is at her irresistible best in Kajra Re.Special mention for Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's fabulous music, delivering what should be the best musical blockbuster of the year. Each song of the soundtrack is innovative and is destined to be a hit." 
" Bonnie and Clyde, Hindi style!","This film was not bad, but it was not excellent either. The last quarter of the film was so botched that it makes you wonder if it was the same writer who wrote the beginning and middle who also wrote the end. It was such a shame to see such an upbeat riotous fun film go down with a clunk like that. Nevertheless, it was a hit at the box office and the Rani + Abhishek show proved to still hold heat. They play a couple of oddly matched lovers who go on a Robinhood type of crime spree through various parts of India, when they don't get their way in life and elude authorities for as long as they can. Personally, Amitabh Bachchan was wasted in his role as the police detective on their trail, to the point that someone as lovable as him gets annoying after a while. His role was overblown and not needed, to be frank. Aishwarya Rai shows up towards the last quarter of the film, to add some much needed spice to the now dragging on plot with her item number 'Kajra re' which she does stunningly well but not enough to save the rapidly souring storyline. Perhaps they should have included her in the script as a distraction for Amitabh's character, I don't know but at that point I'm thinking anything would have worked. I enjoyed the film, but it could have used a better plot twist and not to mention a better ending. Note to director: Never remake something you can't make better!" 
" I can't tell (Abhishek Bachchan) don't act, because that's exactly what he does !","The summary plot of this movie is fascinating. However the outcome of the movie itself is idiot!The matter of Indian (Bonnie and Clyde) who love being famous, with (Amitabh Bachchan) chasing them, then ends up forgiving them, could have made a good heist, thriller, musical comedy, with sentimental side indeed. But (Abhishek Bachchan) was there, along with belittlement too, albeit (Abhishek) alone is enough!(Abhishek) has a mute charisma, and - most importantly - CAN'T ACT AT ALL. During the whole movie, I couldn't stand him on screen doing anything. Waiting him to act is like waiting for having water out of squeezing a stone. It was bad experience, especially while having The Big B himself around. I mean the comparison was horrible, enough to recall the long one-shot scene with them both talking and moving like drunks, where one was doing the job effortlessly, and one wasn't doing it at all. Another problem concerning the presence of (Bachchan) senior which's the tragedy of him being responsible of pushing his son into the showbiz, and - sorrowfully - his birth in this world in the first place!The bore was powerful. The thickness of the numbers turned the movie into an exhausting series of music videos. While being basically a comedy, the dialogue was no lighthearted. The "jobs" of the 2 leads weren't interesting by any mean. The last heist was so fabricated to achieve a chase anyway. Review its disasters with me: the coincidence of Bunty and Babli meeting the officer who, by coincidence too, forgot his ID with them, after, at short notice, he became the head of security in the airport which, coincidently at another short notice, has a gold to be transported, which attracts the 2 leads to steal it, while the delivery of Babli's baby happens ALL AT ONCE!Then a list of "hows"; how Babli could move that easily after the delivery? How (Prem Chopra), the lorry's deriver, provided the 2 fugitive leads with disguise that easily (and speedily?), and the most of all; how the officer could be waiting for the 2 leads in the train station BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL???!!! (How he knew their target place? How he managed to precede them?..). Well, this is why ladies and gentlemen we, in Egypt, name anything extremely unbelievable in our daily life: an "Indian movie." The thing is we used to say it about their very movies before, however with pleasure!The character of (Amitabh) wasn't made well. The sound effect, which alerts about new scheme, was so annoying, and repeated for unbearable many times. The try of impersonating (Amitabh Bachchan)'s naive persona, from movies like (Don - 1978), by his son was so pathetic. Speaking about naive, what on earth that ending was? Were the movie makers that optimistic to think that they made a hit which could spawn a sequel?? Yet, nothing, and I mean nothing, can outclass the embarrassment of (Kajra Rethe); the number of (Amitabh Bachchan), (Abhishek Bachchan), and (Aishwarya Rai) together; that was unnecessary and ENDLESSLY LONG. I bet they wanted to gather the family of stars; the father, his terrible son, and the last's wife, in one song anyway, anyhow, even that served no one any good!Some moments assure that we have a talented director. For instance, the short scene of (Amitabh Bachchan) studying the 2 lead's way of thinking in their room seemed lovely and tangent, with the supposed comic spirit of the whole thing. But that was used miserably, with nearly awful script, and utterly awful lead!The survivors: After copious career, it's rare to see (Ranjeet) nowadays. He did, for instance, 16 movies in 1984 to only (Bunty Aur Babli) in 2005. Hence seeing him even in a cameo, as the store owner, is a delight before brining a lot of memories. Add to that, (Chup Chup Ke); it was nicely scored and shot. And (Rani Mukherjee); no doubt she chewed up the scenery with her true acting and presence, being the only fact in this fake parade of luster.It's a show that wanted us to have a good time. I didn't. I deplored instead, feeling sad for: a talented-less actor of a talented star, a talented-less actor who stars a movie, a talented-less actor who has a mega-exaggerated chance that many talented ones wouldn't, and finally a possible good movie that didn't happen!P.S: Seeing (Amitabh Bachchan) ending the movie with the rap song (B N B), having naked girls dancing hip hop around him-was ugly, rather deformed thing. The marriage of his image, and (Shaggy)'s one, didn't work. The Indian cinema's borrowing from the MTV always ends up as disgraceful beggary!" 
" Desi version of Bonnie and Clyde + Catch Me if You Can + other Film Nior from Hollywood","I am not really sure why I am still giving it 3 stars. I spent my valuable $s to watch this movie in theater and believe me I was really upset (IMDB would not let me write prohibited words...WTF) to watch it. Just figured out that the story wasn't even original and is mostly based on B&C. And, still, the guy claims that the story was his concept? Are Bollywood directors so impudent? Or just admit that we lack originality and creativity in our film industry.A couple of other movies that come to mind that have been copied include Aamir (copy of some Columbian movie), Life in Metro (certain segment taken scene-to-scene from The Apartment) and Ek Chhoti Si Love Story (A Short Story About Love). All the non-Desi counterparts of these movies are excellent." 
" An apt movie to watch on a Saturday night","If I was to say that Bunty & Babli is the product of a genius, I would be telling a lie. However, if I were to say that B & B is utter nonsense, I would then again, be telling a lie. The truth according to how I see it is that B&B lies somewhere in the middle of this spectrum and can be described as an "adequate" movie. Rani mukherjee's acting performance is "adequate", just as "abhishek bachan's is, although the latter being slightly better than the former due to rani's slight over-acting performance in the "crying scene" when they first meet each other in the movie. Amitabh bachan was also "adequate" in his performance, although I thought there were times when his "bad acting" shined through. The parents were OK on both counts..To those of you who do not know the story, Bunty & babli is a narration of 2 twenty-something year old male and female individualists who have a strong dislike for societal conventions. They have ambitions of their own, but are not taken seriously. They live in a small and impoverished town somewhere in north India which fails to complement their ambitions. One night, acknowledging that the only way to fulfil his dreams of becoming rich and famous is to escape from this claustrophobic town, Abhishekh bachan runs away from home. Co-incidentally, Rani mukherjee does the same because her parents were compelling her to marry against her will. Both embark on their own autonomous journeys, which eventually leads them to each other. Because both were in the exact same boat, they had several commonalities which allowed them to relate to each other, eventually spawning a question in both of their minds "how can we get money to go to Mumbai?". Abhishek had a desire to go to mumbai because he had a business proposition to discuss with potential investors, and Rani wanted to go to mumbai because she wanted to become a contestant in the miss India contest. Trusting their instincts, both decide to con a local man into giving them the money they needed to go to mumbai. They succeed and leave with 15,000 rupees. From this point onwards, they are known as Bunty & Babli (fake identities). However, as their needs become bigger and bigger as they walk their journey, their cons begin to develop both in terms of quality and quantity and eventually, they become "con artists". They become so commercialised that every newspaper begins to write about the mysterious duo. Then, they both fall in love with each other and get married..Following this, somewhere near the interval of the movie, Amitabh bachan is introduced as a cunning police officer who embarks on a mission to catch bunty & babli. However, after several failed attempts to outsmart the duo, Amitabh realises that catching B&B is not as easy as he had anticipated. As a result, he accepts this as a challenge and vows to catch them at any cost.In the meanwhile, B&B become so engaged in their acts of con that they fail to realise that they have become criminals. The movie then follows a cat and mouse game and in the midst of this, rani becomes pregnant with Abhishekh's child. This is the turning point of the movie because now, their priorities change and they both decide to give up this con-life, as the aftermath may affect their child. Ironically, amitabh bachan catches them at a time when they had repented for their sins, but unfortunately, nothing is to stop amitabh from bringing them to justice. Luckily with time, Amitabh develops a soft-spot for the trio (baby inclusive) and decides to let them free. Bunty and Babli go back to the small town where this story began and live normal lives.The final segment of the movie begins with an unprecedented visit from Amitabh bachan. He hires the duo to solve a complicated police case, and they happily become con-artists once again; their task being to con criminals this time.I would recommend this movie to be watched on a Saturday night, when you do not really have anything important to do. However, it isn't a total waste of 2.5 hours.I rate B&B 6/10" 
" An entertaining movie, well acted and delivered","The movie starts out very well, with the two dreamy-eyed, small town youngsters yearning to get out and live up their dreams in the big bad city. After that, the pace slowed down quite a bit as Big B's character is introduced. Some of the scenes appear to be forced. The plot itself seems to be based on either Matchstick Men, or Catch Me If You Can. The concept of the 'con' has been borrowed and the usual Bollywood elements added to it. The bar scene before the Aishwarya number has been dragged quite a bit. What truly pulled this one off is superb acting by Jr. B, Rani Mukherjee and the supporting cast, which is quite minimal in its appearance. One wonders if the director had a choice, or if someone was hogging footage (get it?). Both the parents are missing for quite a bit while B&B are romping it up. The reaction in the small town to B&B's exploits also could have been worth exploring but isn't shown.Overall its an entertaining movie, the musical score is good except for one song. One should not watch it as a realistic movie, rather as a fun caper that oozes lots of small town charm. There are definitely shades of films made in the 70s, 80s and one feels the influence clearly. Not surprisingly, this has been a hit grossing 4 times its budgeted cost." 
" Another Failed Attempt by Shaad Ali","Shaad Ali, the son of the wonderful director Muzaffar Ali (Umrao Jaan, Gaman, Anjuman), and the Assistant Director to Mani Ratnam graduated to become a director in the sorry Saathiya - which he follows up with another sorry fare: B&B In this movie, Bunty (Abhishek Bachchan) and Babli(Rani Mukherjee) are two dreamers from their respective small towns who, tired of the limited aspirations of their parents, "run away" to explore their dreams. As is inevitable, they bump into each other soon enough, form a bond, and spend the rest of the movie together. Realizing big dreams are good for small towns only they resort to conning, and become the celebrated "Bunty aur Babli" for their ludicrous scams and cons, never wearing a mask, and yet never being recognized. Cue: DCP Dashrath Singh (Amitabh Bachchan), the man who MUST catch them - he seems to be the only intelligent cop. Figure the rest - no surprises. I have a very weird thought that Shaad Ali may have seen Catch Me If You Can and decided to make candy-floss (or Laddoo-Jalebi) out of it. Shaad should stop making movies, really. He just does not have it in him. And maybe, just maybe, after this movie he may actually never be able to make a movie again anyway. Amitabh Bachchan is in over-drive. The Big B is clearly over-excited at being in the same movie with his son, and he ruins it by over-acting in every scene. Or the lack of a director left him directionless. Rani Mukherjee is in the movie, in rural-kurtas with the deepest neck I have ever seen. She looks the 21-year old Babli like any other 28-year old would. Abhishek is the only performer in the movie, doing justice to his role. His comic timing is good, and with Yuva & Dhoom, this actor proves yet again that he is growing with every next movie. The Shankar-Ehsan-Loy songs are all a mess, and this is the worst job Gulzar has ever done. After the wonderful soundtrack from Saathiya, I expected this movie to have at least one decent composition, but. The choreography & costumes are also third-rate; it features some of the weirdest gyrations in the weirdest apparels I have ever seen. One thing I did like about the movie was the background sounds. Almost every scene is accompanied by a song playing in the background - from "Kabhi Kabhi" to "Mai Hoon Don!" to "Pinjre Wali Muniya". These songs suit each scene so well, that very soon I was playing a guessing game when each scene started. For a movie of this kind, I did the best thing possible - went with a group of 16 and loudly enjoyed the movie for everything it didn't have. If you were in the same screen as my gang, I'm sure you realize how much fun we had.My Rating ---> 2 of 5 (for Small B & the sheer fun I had)" 
" I have seen this movie!","BAUNTY AUR BABLY IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES FROM 2005 in the world, and unfortunately it is impossible to see it in the cinemas of Spain or the rest of Europe.. why we have to eat all the USA trash and never We can go to the cinema to see a bollywood film? Here in Barcelon, in the Indian supermarkets we are so lucky that we can buy this movie for 6 euros!!! We can't understand why such masterpieces are impossible to see in cinema! I recommend absolutely this movie. Musical numbers are not so well staged as in Kal Hoo Na Ho or Main hoon Na, but the documentary style of the movie with superb natural photography, the surprising plot and the great actors that make authentic an impossible bollywood argument make this movie a real surprise. Late movies of bollywood really make us so happy as it is like watching a new Hello Dolly! every month."
