" It doesn't deserve a review but only respect and good wishes for the spirited Dev Saab.","Before watching CHARGESHEET and then daringly going for reviewing it, one has to keep in mind that this is not a film from an ordinary man of our Indian Film Industry. In fact this is a film from one of the most dashing personalities of his times for whom girls used to go for unbelievable extremes in those golden days of his youth. A creative person who has been associated with more than one films which are all now considered among the Best Movies made in Indian Cinema till date including GUIDE, JEWEL THIEF, HARE RAMA HARE KRISHNA, TERE MERE SAPNE & many more.The man, popularly known as DEV ANAND, is now enjoying his life, doing all the things he loves in a wonder age of 88. It's nothing other than a miracle that a person is conceiving, writing, producing, directing and even acting in his own film at the age of 88. Honestly speaking I haven't seen anyone doing such kind of work at this age, in my own life ever. And for that I simply salute DEV ANAND saab for his undying working spirit and his true love for cinema.But talking about the movie CHARGESHEET, which can be vaguely termed as an attempted murder mystery, I would like to describe it in a different way. Considering the fact that it is a result of an 88 years old veteran, ideally the film cannot, should not and need not be reviewed in the usual manner from any angle. But lets understand this statement in the following manner.We all have our beloved old age elders in our houses, dealing with the harsh realities of life wherein their physical faculties are on a continuous decline. We all immensely love them and try to comfort them through every possible means to the best of our abilities. But this old age brings along its own complexities, which in one way can also be considered beautiful as it's a stage where a person again tends to move back in his childhood and becomes a child. Many a times, very old people do certain things or indulge in certain activities which are simply beyond any logic, just like an innocent child's act. They often seem to be in a different world altogether expressing their thoughts through some strange unexplainable poetry or writings which are both insightful and weird at the same time.But we never mind any of their such childish activities at all because deep inside, we know that its not their own fault, as that's actually the old age which is playing its games at the back of their mind. So, knowing the truth, we even love them more in that particular period and try to keep them happy most of the times fulfilling their every little wish like a child.Relating the above fact with the subject here, I would like to say that though it might sound as a bitter reality to many but if truth be said, DEV ANAND's all movies in the recent years are just like a result of some strange imagination of a child-like old man with a powerful spirit of keep on working. An old child of 88 who simply refuses to sit at home playing with his grand children and instead decides to go on making numerous, un-noticeable, extremely weak films, quite similar to the doodles done by children in their school books when they get bored in their daily classes.So even when his latest film CHARGESHEET gave me a real tough time in the theater with everything proving way below the minimum levels of a normal film-making style, still, I refused to move out of the theater just for the sake of this Spirited Old Man called DEV ANAND.For me, his current and all his recent movies are nothing more than a Loving Old Man's ROUGH DOODLES written on the white screen through the medium of a camera, which literally remain meaningless if taken as a film experience. But even then, I truly did not mind seeing it, since it was the outcome of all that hard work done by a creative personality heroically making movies at the age of 88.No, as a true reviewer, I cannot recommend my readers to go for this movie in the theaters in any case, but as a creative person myself I would like to end this write-up with an honest wish that "If in case I am granted a long life reaching the age of 88, I would readily like to spend all those years working on the projects I love, exactly like DEV ANAND Saab is doing at this moment and I would simply love to die on one of my working days."My respect, towards the unbelievable, undying spirit of this man called DEV ANAND."
