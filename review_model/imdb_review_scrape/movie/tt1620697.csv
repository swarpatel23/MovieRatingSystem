" Quite okay movie","The movie 'Bhavnao ko samjho' has been written and directed by the famous stand-up comedian Sunil Pal. The movie reveals 51 stand-up comedians together in a movie for the first time in Bollywood history. The film is full of comedy, yet at different places it is extremely weak and full of overacting. The main characters of the movie are Sunil Pal, Ahsaan Qureshi, Johhny Lever, Raju Srivastava and Navin Prabhakar. They all have parted their part quite well except Navin Prabhakar, who is very disappointing at different places. Acting performances by Johhny Lever and Raju Srivastava are the best.The overall script of the movie is very weak which shows that how a greedy and selfish person has become a good man in the end, however, it is shown in a comical way, yet the movie shows many deficiencies in its script. The movie is written keeping in mind to provide roles to 51 stand-up comedians, that is, it is not an independent work and thus, makes the movie average. If it were an independent work of Sunil Pal, it would been lot better. However, this does not means that this movie is of no worth, but it makes you laugh all the way round the movie, yet you feel there is something low, not up to the standards.Whatsoever people and I have written does not matters much unless an individual watches the movie. Every person has different opinions about everything, so it strongly recommended that one must watch the movie because maybe, he will enjoy the movie more than I did.Overall, I would just like to say that one SHOULD watch this movie. My rating 5.5/10 or rounded off to 6/10."
