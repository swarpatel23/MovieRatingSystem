" Watch it for Nana, Dimple and Vidya.","The concept of incorporating more than one story in a movie running parallel to each other is not anything new to Bollywood. The trend which has been earlier tried in numerous famous projects gets repeated in Tum Milo To Sahi, but thankfully in a much better way. Moving ahead of many other movies made on the similar pattern, director Kabir Sadanand's latest venture has got something to say with many worth watching moments and a well directed climax.Revolving around 3 different love stories dealing with distinctive age groups, TMTS starts off calmly with the introduction of Dimple Kapadia as a Parsi lady running a coffee home and Nana Patekar as a 50 plus person desiring an extension in his job. Facing the refusal from his boss, Nana is forced to spend a retired life alone and gets a little eccentric due to that. But in reality it's his eccentric behavior on the screen which transforms the movie into a not to be missed experience and impresses. In straight words, TMTS completely belongs to Nana Patekar alone before the climax. Especially watch out for his scenes with the small kid and as a first time lawyer in the court. Although Nana's character is written on the similar lines of his own "Prahaar", but that doesn't take away any charm out of his superb act of a retired lawyer cum clerk in the movie. However in the last court room sequence, it's Dimple Kapadia who takes the final moment lead and brilliantly showcases her still unexplored hidden potential as a veteran.Both Nana Patekar & Dimple Kapadia are simply terrific in their scenes together. They convey a lot more through their expressive eyes and silence. The short and intelligent dialogues given to them post intermission, contribute greatly towards the inspiring impact of their individual acts. But sadly, the movie is not able to rise to the level of a masterpiece due to various reasons. The most important one being its editing, which needed to be more tight and crisp. There are several scenes in the first half which are quite slow and tend to drag. Particularly the plot around the young Rehan & Anjana is not engrossing enough. It only proves to be the usual stuff with nothing new to say, contradicting the other two interesting stories running simultaneously. Apart from that, the movie has many unwanted songs which all should have been avoided in the first place. Surprisingly it even has an item number featuring Tanisha (Kajol's sister) doing a very unexpected sexy kind of dance number. In fact it's only the title track, which sounds soothing to the ears and rightly provides the much needed musical support to the theme.Another noticeable merit of the movie is Vidya Maldave who looks stunning in the role of Suniel Shetty's wife and acts like an experienced master of the art. Her persona is both pleasant and hot, very similar to that of Madhuri Dixit, the still remembered queen of the gone era. Suniel Shetty as the husband caught in the dilemma struggles in the start but later delivers a controlled performance towards the end. The story featuring Suniel & Vidya deals with a very important & relevant question that, Is money and status symbol in the society more important than human relationships and family? Rehan Khan & Anjana Sukhani as the young couple of the third story are both pleasantly natural. But their story becomes the weakest part of the movie. The child playing the foreign returned kid is extremely confident. Among the rest, Mohnish Behl gives his usual kind of act and Raghav Sachar looks fresh in his small cameo. But couldn't figure out why Raghav repeatedly shows off his skills of playing various musical instruments in all his ventures. Sandesh Shandilya, as the music director comes up with a good title song but rest all lack the melody part in them. Cinematography is perfect which would be enjoyed more by the Mumbaikars and the people pretty familiar with Mumbai and its living style.Summing up, TMTS is director Kabir Sadanand's second project in which he surely proves himself miles ahead of his first movie. He undoubtedly has got the talent to handle a sensitive project. But I seriously wish he had chosen another basic plot, different than the one used in TMTS. The story of rich people trying to vacant an old house and capture it for their own modernized plans has already been used umpteen times before in Hindi Movies and has got no novelty left in it.Still the movie uses the plot in an entertaining way and the end result is worth watching for its three main performers namely, Nana Patekar, Dimple Kapadia and Vidya Maldave. So you should certainly give it a try!" 
" Good film.","Not a bad film really. Like many of Suniel Shetty and Nana Patekar films,this is also based on social issues.The film revolves mainly around 6 people-a non practicing lawyer, a lady running a popular cafe,a businessman with his wife and kid who wants to make easy money and enjoy the best in life,a teen who comes to mumbai to study and a college girl who is not much into studies but more into extra curricular activities. The film describes how despite being very different from each other initially,they soon get mingled with each others' lives and handle their problems. Regarding the star cast,What I'd say is The best performance is none other than that of Nana Patekar.He's too good.Suniel's OK...trying to be like in his action films,but not too good for emotional stuff. The music is remarkable,storyline is good,choreography OK.The film is worth a watch but not many would have the patience to sit through the whole thing for over 2 hours in the theatre.Don't know what kind of audience the makers expected for it.Anyways,can be watched by all types of audiences.All in all, 6 on 10." 
" A must watch for every youngster and businessmen........","What a movie and Nana just rocks.........even dimple,S was just awesome .......s was very good in the movie i think his third best after .... Hera Peri and other movie named starting d he was just perfect and suits the role... for Nana there is no words his unique acting is just marvelous>>> i enjoyed the movie and learned a lot >>>What a movie and Nana just rocks.........even dimple,S was just awesome .......s was very good in the movie i think his third best after ....

" Nana Patekar steals the thunder","To start with, the title of the movie is completely misplaced (though the title song is refreshing and lingers on your head for a while). Multiple stories are weaved around saving "Lucky Cafe" and thrown in are candy-floss romance, marital discord, organisational structure tryst, corporate greed in the garb of modernisation eventually culminating with court-room scenes (read that "a secret that opens up can of worms"). In a nutshell, there is something for everyone. If there is a single reason you were to watch the movie then let that be Nana Patekar. He breathes life in the character of Subramanyam. Next is Dimple Kapadia who hogs the lime-light as the Parsi lady (after "Being Cyrus). Vidya Malvade essays the teacher of "Main Hoon Na". She has a strong screen-presence however appears too posh for the role. Anjana Sukhani (the Juhi Chawla of the decade) does a decent job. Rehan doesn't come across quite striking, though gets brownie points for getting his accent right. Sunil Shetty was completely miscast. His role has many layers and a seasoned actor like Irfan Khan or Kay Kay would have pushed the envelope. Raghav Sachar was wasted.Writing is good, at least in major parts. Manages to weave multiple stories into a single thread. The subtle humour is interlaced very well with the drama. The court-room scenes seem slightly OTT, but can be safely ignored. Songs are hummable and should catch on with the youth. Kabir was appalling in his first outing "Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao" and he redeems himself with "Tum Milo Toh Sahi".Indeed, it a feel good movie of the year."
