" Falls short of expectations","I have seen Madhur Bhandarkar's earlier films, Chandini Bar and Page 3 and I was tremendously impressed with both of them. Naturally, I had a lot of expectations from 'Corporate'. The promos looked interesting and the film was being promoted in a big way. I watched the film yesterday and I must say...I'm disappointed. The film revolves around the corporate world, unmasking the treachery, betrayal & lack of ethics of corporate giants & Politicians. In some places, the movie has striking similarities to Page 3 and the director's signature style comes across. The same sleaze (Big shots like ministers and top notch executives sleeping around), pre-marital sex, peon's huddled together discussing the personal lives of their bosses and who's sleeping with whom , item numbers popping up when not required, actresses with no integrity..and so forth. It gets a little tiresome at the end and u end up thinking "Doesn't anyone have principles? Are all the rich and powerful the same?" What is most disappointing in this film is the character of the main protagonist. In Bhandarkar's earlier movies too, women have been the main protagonists but in this movie, you don't feel for Bipasha's character. Even though she is victimized, you don't feel any sympathy for her. I'm in no way saying that Bipasha has done a bad job in the movie but it's certainly not a role that she'll be remembered for. Her character in the film, Nishi, is of a divorced corporate executive who is ambitious, intelligent, crafty and who doesn't hesitate to resort to a few tricks of her own to steal the company secrets of a rival. She is single, independent and not in any way bothered about the fact that she is the butt of office gossip because of her relationship with the chairman's brother-in-law. She knows exactly what goes on in the corporate world, all the shady deals, the fact that her boss can stoop to any level for 'profit' (which BTW, is the bottom line in the corporate world) and yet, she blindly owns up to a crime that she has not committed (throwing away her reputation & career) and expresses full faith in her company and colleagues that they will eventually bail her out. I mean, that is something which is a little hard to digest. You might end up thinking "Well, serves you right for being so stupid!'As for the performances, this movie can in no way match up to Chandini Bar or Page 3. Everyone is just about OK. I feel Kay Kay has been wasted. He is such a talented actor but has so little to do in this movie. Minisha Lamba & Sameer have insignificant roles. Raj Babbar, Rajat Kapoor, Vinay Apte and Harsh Chayya are adequate. But everything said and done, I'd still recommend this movie because it is watch able. The first half is boring but the pace quickens in the second half & the plot becomes interesting towards the end. Only one word of caution.....don't expect too much." 
" Too realistic its scary!","After watching director Madhur Bhandharkar's Chandni Bar and Page 3, this was definitely a highly anticipated film by critics and fans alike. This time he was getting his hands dirty in the big bad world of corporate after tackling the dark world of bar dancers and celebrity-hood. The fact that this is the third installment of his trilogy, I was sure he will be dealing into the realistic topic of corporate firms and yet there was very little to predict or expect. The movie starts off on a nice solemn note as we are introduced into the rivalry of the 2 big enterprises. Do not expect any big twist or turns in the story, but the story just moves Madhur way. Performances by Bipasha and Kay Kay are on top note. Bipasha is impressive as hard-worker who will do anything to get her work done, and Kay Kay is very realistic. Short comedy and jokes scenes in between do not work. If he was trying to pull a Ram Gopal Varma, Madhur still needs to master the skill of developing character roles, however his effort is well appreciated and managed to keep me glued on my seat, regardless of the low quality VCD. Relating to the first 2 films, this film to does not end on a happy note... well just goes to say life goes on!!" 
" The second episode in Madhur Bhandarkar's trilogy revealing the darker side of the India's corporate world.","After the exposé on Mumbai's "Page 3" society in a film of the same name,this one veers into the world of business barons and boardroom battles. The movie is based on the philosophy that in business, the ultimate goal is profit. And it does not matter if ethics are completely bypassed to achieve it. People who've seen Page 3 will identify Bhandarkar's signature style, especially the boldness with which he blows the cover off the perverse lifestyles of the rich and powerful. Sleaze is of course there in ample helpings. There are also the "aside" acts involving the lower wrung characters where they make fun of their bosses, as in Page 3." 
" Interesting story, well-acted","I found this movie to very entertaining. It could have been directed in the Ram Gopal Varma manner with nothing to disrupt the flow of the plot. Too bad that Bollywood fans only really reward masala movies. It dissuades people with good stories from relying solely on them. This was a serious role for Bipasha so they couldn't have doing her usual naach routine. But the main thread of the story, of the trench warfare between large corporations was gripping and well-presented. I think the fallout where assistants took the fall for policies they fought is quite realistic. Only in Japan do you ever seem to see the persons ultimately responsible taking their responsibility. Elsewhere the rationale seems to be "I don't have to, therefore I won't". The script didn't cop out on that point which earned it some respect.I think this is the first meaty role I've ever seen Rajat Kapoor do, and he did it well. Bipasha's role was atypical, and she fit into it way better than I had any right to expect. Same with Kay Kay. I've worked for many decades in corporations, and the whole thing rang true to me.I give it four out of five stars." 
" Madhur B has fallen into his own formula trap","This is a very good example of how movie directors fall in trap of the successes of their own formula. Madhur Bhandarkar uses senior actors from Marathi theater, sprinkling of sex, a couple of side-line characters who keep audiences entertained by giving "gyan" on corporate life.DBefreo you go on, let me warn you. The movie is so insipid,that I have revealed the plot a little.This movie clearly falls to create the punch that Page 3 did. The script is very very weak. In fact, in the second-half, the host-shot award-winning business executive Nishi (Bipasha Basu) coolly signs all the papers going to enquiry commission, without even glancing at them once!!! To cut a long story short..... Nishi steals secrets of new project from Parvez(CEO of Marwa Industries - a competing Business group) To achieve this she uses an age-old art of seduction, followed by a direct attack on Parvez's masculinity by an ultra-hot model. Then she proceeds to copy all the project details using a USB drive, while Parvez continues his deep slumber caused by sexual excesses with this model. This is known as "Social Engineering" in parlance of hackers. It is possibly a first in Hindi movies!!! Funny, each and every one of these corporate biggies takes to drinks, if things don't go their way. Madhur Bhandarkar has mixed up his characters. He should know by now business success and drinking habits don't go hand-in-hand. If he continued to be a detailed oriented guy as he used to be, he would have shown Pan Parag Pan Masala somewhere :-) (No kidding . Believe me when I say it is the most used corporate tranquilizer used.).The end is so flat .... the loyal corporate executive (Bipasa Basu) goes to jail to cover her employers and delivers a kid there. She loses her lover (Kay Kay) who is killed by his own brother-in-law and industrialist Vinay Sehgal (Rajat Kapoor) so that he does not spill the beans about the real culprit is in pesticides contamination case to media.More on performances - It is a good move for Bipasa Basu, who seems to have acted well (under direction of Madhur). Vinay Apte pulls of a convincing politician. Kay Kay should stop smoking, or else he is going to look like a TB patient in future.Even usual solitary Asha Bhosle song cannot save the movie. After high expectations and a couple of recommendations, the movie turned out to be a damp squib." 
" completing the trilogy of one story in three different situations","Madhur Bhandharkar seems to be having dearth of stories or is in the process of creating a film making formula for himself like the one karan johar has for himself.If that is the case then it is unfortunate for bollywood that one of the better director of the industry is also resorting to such farce.The problem with corporate is that it has exactly same storyline as Mr.bhandharkar's earlier acclaimed films to name chandni bar and page 3. It has a female lead which has struggling past and she is settling down nicely with the given environment(in this case the corporate world) without any guilt.She is growing in stature and creating a healthy social life with a man whose working also is (very much)related somewhere or the other around her field of work.And then to make the long story short that world of hers softly but surely destroys and swallows her dreams, aspirations,her pride and destroys or disgraces the man in her life living her with her supporters to learn that its a big bad world out there with everything you need except a place for heart.This is a good story to tell but not to be retold with different situations.Once the director explains and settles the audience with the environment he creates, the audience can quickly recognize what will happen in the end no matter what happens between the start and the end.Corporate has somehow the few of important characters similar to the ones of directors previous films especially page 3.To the directors credit he creates the corporate world of India sincerely with fine detailing rather than spoofing some public figure. The characters in the film are strong and well written except miss manisha lamba's character but all actors have performed there role sincerely.I feel that Bipasha's character just may not get the audience sympathy as it acts stupidly and takes a self destroying decision rather than getting destroyed by other.Overall the movie is still a well made movie but looses its novelty due to directors lack of ideas and resorts to his own tried and tasted tricks for completing the story." 
" Excellent plot...","The movie begins with a subtle note about the corporate world in India and then unfolds itself into the dirty and disgusting games which the men in power play so that they could remain on the top. The performances of all the characters are beautifully done. No-one looks out of place. The main character that stands out is the performance by the leading lady Bipasha and Kaykay. The music is huge let down as there was no need of putting any songs in the movie but they were pushed into situations not required. The movie unfolds a beautiful story which is so close to the real corporate world. Indian cinema requires such kind of movies to made more. Keep up the good work Madhur Bhandarkar..." 
" Must watch for every graduate of business school  Reality Shock!","The cut-throat corporate wars, business tactics, strategies, sleazy deals, political paybacks, eroded business values, the soft-drink scandal.... you name it Corporate has it all... with a touch of realism.Flip open a copy of The Economic Times, the headlines forms the backbone of the movie. In an attempt to incorporate all of them (which require background and screen time), the movie as whole does not get it right.The snippets/ humour predominant in Page-3 are missing in Corporate.Raj Babbar is perfect as Marwah, typical business dynasty. Its good to see Navni Parihar after a long time. The superstitious beliefs of Dharmesh Marwah are true-to-life.Rajat Kapoor is a perfect cast for the Harvard graduate raring to be the nexgen entrepreneur.Lillete Dubey as the media bookie is perfectly cast.Minisha Lamba's role got chopped at the editing table big time.Sandeep Mehta does the leachy Pervez with utmost perfection that you will hate the very sight of him.Kay Kay Menon  this guy is a powerhouse of talent and no two ways about it. Very effective.And finally Bipasha  in business suits she gets into the character of no nonsense Nishi. She portrays the softer side of the character equally well.Thanks to real-life celebrity for this appearances in the movie.Finally the end is similar to Chandni Bar  bit depressing, true-to-life.... reinforcing the fact that might is right." 
" A surprise","Corporate explores the dark world of politics and under-the-table boardroom techniques in the business world. Set in present day Mumbai, it follows the story of our main protagonist Nishi (Bipasha Basu) and how everything and everyone around her have an effect.Tightly scripted and well acted, Corporate could have made it to being the best film this year, if it wasn't for a few things.1. The director brings in songs where they weren't needed. The item number, especially, was completely out of place.2. The slight love angle between Minisha and Sameer is totally useless... in fact, Sameer's character wasn't even needed.3. the character of the pervert CEO was pushed too far. He is a middle aged man in a bad marriage. He likes other women. But he doesn't need to bite his lips all the time in a horny fashion. Totally unrequired and a bit unrealistic.4. Bpasha's scene at home with Minisha did not need to have as much emotion as it did. It came off weak, since she was shown as a strong woman. A strong woman in a bad marriage would not be weeping that way 5 years later.All this does not mean that this is a bad movie. It is a rather good one, in fact. These points have been marked just as a severely critical viewpoint. You can actually walk in and totally enjoy the film." 
" Good movie...... not your typical Bollywood fare","I saw corporate on DVD one afternoon expecting to fast forward through most of it but I was pleasantly surprised as I hardly touched the remote. (I did use it to get fast forward through the songs though)The actors were pretty good especially Rajat Kapoor who gave an excellent performance showing all the nuances of his character. Most actors even Shahrukh would have gone overboard playing the corporate leader but not Rajat. The ensemble cast all performed well underplaying their roles which is not usually a Bollywood preference with their larger than life characters. Bipasha, Raj Babbar and the actor playing the politician were quite good.Songs were not really required, I preferred it when they were in the background.Although i am sure this movie will not do well at the Box office but I found it intelligent and well made so do watch it." 
" I have got one lesson from this film","I have got one lesson from this film â" "Never become emotional in your corporate world otherwise you will be finished." I would like to say Mr. Madhur Bhandarkar through merinews that why you have ended your reel of "Corporate" with a weeping, moaning, crying, griping women who have accepted the situation without even pretence of a fight. Why Mr. Bhandarkar??? Same like Corporate, you have presented an acceptable image of women against harassment in Page 3, in which one of the three women characters has been bargained by her boss. If she was really talented then why she has to compromise with so-called term and conditions of a male character??? Why didn't you try to understand our mindset, women mindset?" 
" Enter the sleazy world of the CORPORATE BORED - ROOM","I'm not a big fan of these so called arty and DIFFERENT kind of films but I had to go check out this new mall in Mulund and I had promised my friends I would watch a movie with them and this is the only one I hadn't seen.Needless to say I automatically lowered my expressions before I entered this film.What struck me immediately was how DIFFERENT AND EXPERIMENTAL (In the words of Madhur Bhandarkar) this film was.Let me illustrate. By giving you the recipe for different films.1) All rich people are bad and morally challenged, almost all of them are whore-mongers and even the most uptight of them will indulge in premarital sex and bend the rules.2)Poor and working class people possess a high moral character and only indulge in dirty work if forced by the circumstances.3)All women are exploited by men, if they are rich and powerful they exploit other women and are secretly drug dealers, or pimps.4)Most probably especially If the woman is the heroine and doing bad things (or playing along with the system) its because the circumstances have forced her but no matter what sooner or later she will have change of heart and mend her ways. IT IS NEVER EVER THE WOMENS FAULT.5)All politicians are bad and are willing to sell the country, most of them are also whore-mongers.6)Most if not all NGOS are run by publicity hungry people who dance to the tunes of these morally challenged rich people.7)Any government official can be bought.8)Anyone can get away with murder especially the bad guys.9)All second rung actresses, actors and models are whores or characterless.10)If enough people find the movie SAD AND DEPRESSING AND IF THEY SPEND HALF THE MOVIES BUDGET ON MARKETING THE MOVIE THEN PEOPLE WILL AGREE THAT SINCE IT IS SAD AND DEPRESSING, AND SINCE THE MAKER SAYS SO THIS FILM IS DIFFERENT ENSURING BOX OFFICE SUCCESS.You get the drift don't you almost all the so called different film makers follow this formula or variations of it.By promoting this cultural divide they are able to feed of the masses and the classes. All you need to do is market your movie as different and the so called lovers of cinema and socially responsible people from the classes and the uptight people from the masses will watch your film.Safe to say this movie sticks to this formula to the hilt. It seems like PARTS OF PAGE 3 HAVE BEEN CUT OF A FEW SCENES ADDED AND A NEW FILM IS MADE.Don't TRUST ME BUT EVEN THE AUDIENCE IN THE THEATRE SIGHED WHEN THE SECOND ITEM NUMBER WAS PLAYED AND LAUGHED AT THE SO CALLED EMOTIONAL SCENES. WHEN KK SAYS "MUJHSE GALTI HO GAYI" A CHEAP JOKE CAME TO EVERYONES MIND AND TRUST ME WAS CRACKED BY OVER 3 GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND APPRECIATED BY ALL.The acting of this movie is great but you come to expect that from such an established cast.Bipasha Basu's ACTING WAS STRICTLY OK SHE HAS MILES TO GO BEFORE SHE CAN TURN UP A DECENT PERFORMANCE. You could see the effort behind the scenes she showed none of the ease that the superb supporting cast and KK showed.Sammir Dattani and Minnisha Lamba were not that attractive showpieces and their insignificant roles added nothing to the movie and only served as a distraction I can think of no CINEMATIC MOTIVE BEHIND THEM BEING IN THIS MOVIE.The movie had to unnecessary item numbers that were ordinary none of the Rickshaw Blasting UP hilaoing KUAN MA DOOB JAOONGI here.The guards and peons provided some much needed comic relief the part where even the biggest officials steal stationary was indeed true and hilarious.In all and ordinary film in all aspects.If you want to watch a DIFFERENT FILM I would recommend watching Page3 again.+s superb acting from the entire cast, some pretty original representations of politicians, businessman and god-men.+/-'s Bipasha Basu , soundtrack -'s COMPLETELY UNORIGINAL AND Predictable, NOTHING NEW ON OFFER, mediocre cinematically.total 4/10 (would have given a five because of the superb acting but cant give any encouragement to such films)." 
" Simply boring but indicating something greart!","No love, no emotions only profit, betrayal & treachery. But, why only one women suffered for this?! A very poor story & boring. In a point of view, it may be right actually. Innocents are always suffering traditionally! Ritesh is a very poor & dumb character here. Nishi was also boring in the last. It could have beem better!!" 
" Enjoyable film","This movie was so totally interesting but entertaining and storyline good movie and storyline Storyline is good screenplay is superb background music is superb editing is superb direction is superb Songs are really impressive Kay Kay is superb bipasha is good minnisha is superb raj is superb rajat kapoor is superb other cast is excellent 4/5" 
" Great Attempt","I find it a little upsetting when a director who tries to make something beyond the typical masala and love triangles; and is simply bashed up by the audience without even considering his effort. Madhur has done a great job here, just like he had in Chandni Bar and Page 3. There are several aspects to be appreciated in this film.The first of these is that this is a film driven by story. It is not made to present any commercial star as a fabulous performer. It is meant to expose the corporate life, and that is exactly what it does. It takes a third person perspective into the corporate world, and exposes people at various levels of a corporation, thus being just to every character in the film, irrespective of the screen time they receive.The next appreciable point is that this film is blunt. It makes no attempt to justify or compensate for any misdoings of any actors or stars in the film and kudos to the actors for taking up these shaded characters.The third point of significance is that the film is substantial. It goes into the depth of various processes and does not mind not ending up as a feel good film. It has a well thought out plot, and covers a lot of events that never stray from the theme of the film.Additionally, actors Rajat Kapoor, Kay Kay and Raj Babbar are fabulous, as always. Kudos to Madhur for taking actual actors for his film. Bipasha is average but not irritating in the least. Madhur does a good job of narration barring his accent. I liked his narration because it was a good change from the usual, overly intense narrations. I liked the conversation between the peons which is so reminiscent of what actually happens in offices. Ritesh taking a share of Nishi's work, Nishi's pride of being a woman, Rajat's denial of his wrong decisions, Raj Babbar's desire to take revenge are all very interesting and refreshingly realistic plots.On the downside, the editing could have been crisper, and made the film more compact. I wished to see more of Harsh Chhaya,too. Lastly, some scenes were plain awkward like the one where Nishi tells Pervez that he is not sorry for losing his job but for being defeated by a woman. Could have been more sensible.Nonetheless, I wish to repeat that we need to encourage such films that have substantial plots and that respect the intelligence of us audience. I definitely recommend this one." 
" A realistic Potrayl of Corporate World","Bhandarkar's 'Corporate' is one of the finest movies of Bollywood ever made on the business rivalries in a corporate world. The Marwhas and Sehgal groups depicted as the two big corporate giants of food industry in Mumbai are always in a rival situation to outclass each other in their business. When the movie was released in 2006 the media rumored that plot of the movie was based on the actual business rivalry between Coke and Pepsi groups. It seemed to be true as Bhandarkar is well known for making realistic cinema as he has done in past with hits like Chandani Bar, Page 3. Well Corporate movie has all the ingredients of the corporate life style. The profit making as the sole ideology of the capitalists was there ever since the start of Industrial revolution in England and it still continues in its most refined form in this age of Globalization. The movie very well presents this fact through its characters and its basic plot. The star cast chosen was great. Whether it was Gulab Rao the state minister, Raj Babbar( President of Marwah groups), Bipasha, Key key Menon all did full justice to their roles. Their dresses, mannerism, gestures , dialogues, business meeting scenes presented a very realistic nature of the business world. I somehow disagree with the views of the above viewers who in their comment have stated that item number song was unnecessary. But it had a connection with the movie. It depicted and exposed ministers secret acts of sleeping with beautiful actresses or dancers in hotels. The movie very well explains the much known fact that in corporate sector money and profit are much preferred than a relationship. Besides this in business one has to be very watchful and alert and a slight irresponsibility at managerial level position can put the entire company in a big trouble especially if the irresponsibility is due to one's temptation or habit of drinking and womanizing. Above all in my view a corporate is a must watch especially for a management student. The prestigious IIM in India had incorporated this movie as part of their teaching curriculum way back in 2006-07. It seemed Bhandarkar really worked hard in researching this issue and thus presented in a highly commendable fashion. Bhandarkar has brought the issues of ambitions, corruptions, deceit, betrayal, success and failures in the field of journalism, corporate sector, fashion,law. I think an important area of 'Education' has yet to be researched and presented before the public by Bhandarkar."
