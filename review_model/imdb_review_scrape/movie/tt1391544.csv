" Dhoondte Reh Jaoge.... logic ie.","Dhoonte Reh Jaoge for logic in the plot of this film, akin to the attempt of super-flop film Kunal & Paresh are making. For starters, what was the logic behind the actors signing the dotted line. Beats me!!!Kunal Khemu seems to be a good actor who at least is serious about giving his 100%. However, the accountant with locks of hair is not good characterisation.Soha Ali Khan is hopeless. The only time her performance was average was in RDB. Safe to say, another spoilt star-child.Paresh Rawal is passable. Watching Sonu Sood requires pain-killer. Johnny Lever finally gets some work after his self-imposed exile owing to the sudden emergence of the stalwarts on the TV comedy shows. Nevertheless, his idea of comedy is well past sell by date.Hrishita Bhatt & Deepal Shaw were hardly there.An attempt to make a spoof of movie is novel idea (it works in Hollywood) and if some serious writing was done, I am sure this movie would have worked wonders." 
" I got more than the expectations.","Now I will not say that it is some best comedy movie coming out from Indian cinema, but certainly this movie came out as a surprise at least for me.I was watching this movie hoping that my next 2-3 hours are going to be wasted badly, but opposite to that this movie made me laugh.The script is well written and the movie has a natural flow.I will suggest anyone this movie who want to laugh... remember laughing is a great exercise.Keep laughing.I gave it 10/10 to improve its rating mainly, but truly it deserve a 6 or may be 7." 
" Mildly Entertaining!!!","Film is a cocktail of Hollywood's Bowfinger and The Producers (What Bollywood film ain't??). It spoofs Lagaan, Gadar and Sholay while its own story follows Rangeela's path towards the end. To be honest there are some funny sequences and if you just drop your guard a bit then this film turns out to be very entertaining. Cast does OK but the biggest drawback is the number of songs particularly one where there is ample skin show for no reason. Soha Ali is the other weak link just like she was in Mumbai meri jan. Among others, Johnny Lever almost steals the show with his Pervez Musharaff (Ashraf) act. I say almost as the makers never really explored his character in detail. All in all, if you go with the flow you will be just fine." 
" The Producers Come to Bollywood","This is very under rated adaptation of the producers.An chartered account and a down and out producer figure out that they will take more money than required to make the film, and then make a cheap low budget film and run away with the rest of the money...they enroll the help of misfits to make a epic failure...for people who like films about film making (like luck by chance, om shanti om, etc) will enjoy this film...Khunal Khemu is good as the honest accountant, and Paresh Rawal as usual gives a solid performance as the shifty has been shubash ghai type producer, Soha ali khan plays khunals plain jane girl friend who is casted as the female lead in this disaster of a film. new comer sonu sood plays the SRK-Hrithik-Amitabh type of superstar, who is conned into doing the film" 
" Nice, Funny But full of flaws","The problem is that when they chose a story, they don't even think that it is good or not, they just go with it. What is the problem with these directors and producers how they are so bad in decision making.A one time watch movie just because of Dilip Joshi, and Paresh Rawal. Enjoy If you can!" 
" Funny!","This movie had me in stitches, just like the film within this film, you'll find yourself laughing for all the wrong reasons and at all the wrong scenes that aren't even meant to be funny.Kunal Khemu (or as I like to call him...'Cutie-pie') plays an up and coming accountant who gets dragged into the world of movie-making when one day while out celebrating the birthday of his girlfriend (played by Soha Ali-Khan) he is conned by a movie-producer (played by Paresh Rawal). Exhausted from butting heads with Raj Chopra (Rawal's character) he devises a plan with the help of Chopra to pull a Ponzie scheme on a bunch of fellow movie producers to invest in an epic film project they plan to sabotage for their selfish purposes.Top notch performances by Paresh Rawal, Kunal Khemu, Sonu Sood & Soha Ali-Khan, although I could have done without seeing Soha Ali-Khan dressed up as Jodhaa from 'Jodhaa Akbar' (just one of the many films spoofed within the film)." 
" Dhoondte reh jaaoge?","Why a title like that? it doesn't mean anything in the filmWell Spoofs on movies are done to death on MTV and now also with the never ending list of comedy soaps which struck the small screen like hellThe film has a plot lifted from THE PRODUCERS but the movie is funnyThere is a plot thankfully which is again not too innovativeThe film is funny but, the entire plan of making a flop movie works well sadly the RANGEELA type love angle between Kunal-Soha isn't well handled and seems like a side plotEVen the spoofs are there but not too hilarious overall just in bits and spurtsThe entire climax too is too clich√©d Yet we didn't expect anything from the film yet it does entertain Direction by Umesh Shukla is average- below average Music is okay, but too many songs spoil the show Editing is loose, with scenes dragging many timesAmongst actors Kunal Khemmu looks his part and acts very well, his comic acting which was below average in DHOL and good in SUPERSTAR is improving with every film Soha is alright, nothing much to do actually Sonu Sood is shown in 4 roles and he is average He is bad in the Dharam imitating scene which is mastered on the small screen by many stand up comedians Amongst rest Johny Lever is hilarious Paresh Rawal is ageing but he is very funny here though nothing new Liked his outburst in the hotel narrating the story Dilip Joshi is okay" 
" Lol!","Umesh Shukla is a zany filmmaker & 'Dhoondte Reh Jaoge' proves that.'Dhoondte Reh Jaoge' is about two-good-for-nothing guys who plan to make a Flop film. A unique & crazy idea! Some jokes are so so funny that you get into a full-throated roar! While some are like Akshay Kumar's comedy films, completely bland.The first hr is entertaining, the second is not. It picks up in The pre-climax, when the premiere takes place... it's hilarious! Especially the so-done Lagaan portion. The climax, however, leaves no impact. But I don't know why, I get a strong feeling that this film will gain a Cult following in the coming years.Performance wise, Paresh Rawal & Johny Lever rule the show, with their impeccable comic-timing. Both are superb. Kunal Khemu is lovable. The highly-talented guy isn't getting his due. Right from his childhood days to now, his acting has always been super. Sadly, none of his films have done well, and neither has made a huge fan-base. Let's hope he gets what he deserves in the coming time. Sonu Sood is passable. Soha Ali Khan is, as usual, dull. Dilip Joshi stands out. Shabbir Ahmed is excellent in a cameo.This is surely not a good film, but much better than the crap going on right now." 
" An odd couple , with more odd people , trying to make you laugh !","Anand Pawar , a born loser , and a naive ,middle-class working man , with faltering speech , to add to the woes , loves Neha; she aspires to be an actress one day , but presently ,is nothing more than an ordinary girl next door . Raj ,on the other hand , is a cunning , slimy producer , who has to play tricks to get his story accepted , and even shop lift clothes , for appearing decent . Kunal Khemu , Soha Ali Khan , and Paresh Rawal , in the lead roles of this movie , are supposed to entertain us , along with the medley of a bunch of crazy characters , who pop up as per the need of the hour . Lifted , of course from Hollywood , that is the idea of making a flop film , Dhoodate Reh Jaoge manages to evoke a few funny situations , but fizzles out in the end , with crowds in the theater going in a frenzy , supposedly with the comic situations in the film , and the funny takes on the Bollywood block busters . The director , the script writer , and the actors ,too , are at a loss to give a fitting climax to this otherwise good attempt to produce some thing different than the usual formula films , in it's climax , which ends on rather unbelievable ,goody goody acts and dialogs , like Aryan handing over Neha , which he looked after as Anand's security deposit , and Neha running in his arms ,in a full bridal costume , like a fancy dress competition ! Sood never changes his expressions throughout the movie ! Soha's attempt at dancing like Urmila ,is casual , and confirms that she can't dance ,for heaven's sake ! Paresh has started to show signs of his advancing age , and his flirting stints as well as some vulgar actions and dance , smack of overacting , unacceptable . Amongst all , kunal is good , and surprisingly , natural . Hero's duplicates idea and playing on their physical handicaps is stretched to the limits , and makes it pathetic instead of funny. Some how , the movie comes across as a childish sort of a presentation , with every thing carried out in a casual manner , specially the Press conference scene , investors handing over money etc. Today's Bollywood has come a long way from all the situations shown here , and a very vibrant and sleek industry , in spite of the heap of garbage it produces , by spending in crores of rupees every year !Nevertheless , this could be termed as a good effort at making fun of our big time productions , but sadly , it wasn't done seriously enough , to throw a well-aimed snow ball , and initiate fun , at the expense of the stalwarts. Nako Nako number is well taken , and Kunal has danced with ease . Want to pass some time without bothering for the money you spent , better watch it on Video than in a theater , a little patience is required ,to sit through till the climax , going flop towards the end ! i have given it a six , because it's quite funny in the first half , and the tempo was quite smooth . Must mention Johny Lever , who leaves us yearning for seeing his old self ; Tolerable , but not that hilarious like his other movies . Like to watch odds ? Then go for it !"
