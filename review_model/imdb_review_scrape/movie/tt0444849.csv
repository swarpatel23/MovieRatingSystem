" Superb story and Good acting","What made me feel good after watching this movie was ... a good story and brilliant acting.. specially Priyanka Chopra has done a very good job... she is the lady who knows what acting is.... and no doubt if she will be the next bollywood queen... John Abraham has also done a very good job playing the character of a hit-man... all together a good movie to watch ... worth the time... And I think after a long time had bollywood came up with such a brilliant movie I don't know why such movies are not liked by the Indian audience... they go in for crap... I would say that Karam has got a good story, good acting and screenplay, but still this movie did not do much business ... sad to hear that... Indian audience ... wake up plzzzzz...." 
" A True Brilliant Masterpiece By Hindi Cinema","All i can say that i cannot find a single mistake in the movie, The Movie Direction, Shot Composition, Cinematography, Music, Acting all were Absolutely PerfectJohn Abraham's Acting was really Flawless, as for Priyanka's Role, As far as i can say A Very Hard Hitting Challenging role it was indeed it was by far her Best Performance, Direction was like WOW!!! Sanjay Gupta, Truly did his best!! Cinematography: Oh My God i was AWED by that The Composition Was PERFECT!! Music: The Music was Great, Vishal Shekhar Showed Their Techniques as Master Musicians, The Song Tinka Tinka, Has a Soft Groovy Effect to it, The Song Tera hi Karam, Was Brilliant!!!When i watched the film MY EYES were Hooked From Start to EndYou Will Find it Very Brilliantly Directed Even though I'm writing about this 2 years later but it is Definitely Worth BuyingGo and Grab a Copy of the DVD out on EROS" 
" Escaping the mob is harder than it seems.","Bollywood crowds were not pleased with this film. For good reason of course. This movie breaks out of the regular tradition of song, dance and predictable drama and creates a movie rarely seen in the Bollywood industry. The direction was amazing. The movie was inspired by many action movies from the past but what makes it different is its setting and culture. Very few Hindi movies have been made with such openness and innovation. If you want a new twist on a classic story watch Karam. It will blends elements of Bollywood and American action. Its an entertaining watch if nothing else. Some scenes are a little graphic but they are not gratuitous. Also, the casting was excellent." 
" One of my most favourite films","Karam is a very, very interesting story told in a stylish format. It was so emotionally & psychologically thrilling, the whole movie is charged with pulse pounding suspense and made so dark & sinister that gives you the tensive mood for the film. Inspired from Collateral & Kill Bill. The best Bollywood movie in 2005. Sanjay F. Gupta made a terrific film for his first attempt he only made one film so far but still he is one of my favourite directors. He was a cinematographer of Qayamat, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Zinda. The story is mentioned in the plot summery and also by other comment users.Karam has probably the best cinematography in any Bollywood movie, which suits the mood e.g. the flashback scene of John's first kill, was in animation, black and white for John's dream and sepia for the song Tera Hi Karam when he was in huge depression. The animated scene was in black and white the only colour was blood. The main menu of the DVD is wavy, green. The best scenes in the film has to be the: 1. Animated scene.2. When John was trying to save his wife he was wearing dark sunglasses and black gloves.3. Where he was in the club during the song Ishq Nachaya Kare dressed like Eric Draven in The Crow and he killed the first man in his hit list.Songs are excellent without a doubt every song is good the best ones probably are Tinka Tinka and Ishq Nachaya Kare.I also noticed a goof when John received his wife's finger it was a full finger but when he was talking to her on the phone after the song Ishq Nachaya Kare her finger was half cut." 
" Theme illustrated magnificently!","This movie is definitely one of the best Indian breakthrough films of 2005. The protagonist of the film, John Abraham, is actually a negative character. Playing the role of a hit-man, he has a long history of sins. He finally realizes the enormity of his wrongdoings after accidentally killing a small girl during a mission. Although his spiritual awakening does help him to some extent, his numerous murders do not let him live in peace. In a constant struggle to start life afresh, it is extremely interesting to see how his past deeds catch up to him. John gives a good performance. Priyanka is also great in her small role. The climactic monologue and visuals are beautiful. Cinematography is excellent. "Tinka Tinka" is a very beautiful song. "Tera Hi Karam" is a great track with an awesome, shocking, and eye-opening video displaying the theme of the movie. The theme is portrayed magnificently as the movie does a good job in showing how all the characters' karma dictates the degree of suffering they must endure in their life and/or death." 
" Life is hard, when you're a hit-man!","I felt really sorry for John Abraham in this film. He proved to us all that try as you may, but even being that sexy can't save you when you've gone down the wrong path. Karam is the story of a man (played by Abraham) who kills others for a living and is told in second-person retrospect by his wife (played by Priyanka Chopra) and painfully so. From the minute this film begins, you know that Abraham's character is doomed. When you find out that he's attached to Priyanka Chopra in the film, you just have to know by then that they are star-crossed lovers. Abraham tries to quit the hit-man business after a hit gone awry but finds out the hard way that quitting the underworld is not as easy as it may seem. His pregnant wife is kidnapped, tortured and eventually held captive while the mob demand one last hit from Abraham which involves him taking out a host of people. This hit is the majority of the film and you can only imagine what becomes of him when the job is done. Karam is a very thought provoking and sad film that was very well executed on the part of all the actors. I hated the drug use scenes though because they were a bit too graphic. Abraham looks even more sexy than he usually does in this film and when he is beside Chopra, the screen just begins to melt from their combined hotness. Hahaha! :-D The songs are as excellent as they are haunting. A truly wonderfully tale of love, ambition and loss." 
" Although the movie is below a well-made movie, it is the effort that is very much visible and gets the movie its marks","Sanjay F Gupta graduates from a Music Video Director to Movie Director with this movie, and it shows. While watching the movie, you realize what the director intended to show, but could not put it up on the screen exactly as he visualized it. His movie works well in short-spans, and then mellows to mediocre fare, until it lifts again. And not very surprisingly, the best portions of the movie are the build up to the songs, which seamlessly blend into the movie's narrative.This movie is about an assassin John (John Abraham) on a guilt-trip, who wants to lay his weapons after mistakenly killing (almost) an entire family. He has a lovely wife Shalini(Priyanka Chopra) who sings at a restaurant (and is thankfully not a bar-dancer). At the same time, the delicate balance between the underworld dons of Mumbai is being tipped to one side, as a faction tries to kill off John's boss aptly named Captain (a loud debut by stage artiste Bharat Dabholkar). In vengeance, and on John's reluctance, Captain holds Shalini captive to make John pick his weapon and kill the opposition. What follows is a little story of crossing and double-crossing as John plays side to side, all the while looking out for his own. On his trail is Inspector Wagh (a very confident debut by Shiny Ahuja).Again, a different story and a nice performance by John Abraham. He looks the part and plays the part well. Technically sound (coz of his background), the director handles new technology very nicely. This is the only Hindi movie I know that uses Color Grading to proper effect. Slow-motion with such smooth movements I have only seen in Kaante before (ironically, director by another Sanjay Gupta). He also uses a technique that I have read been described as a lift from Kill Bill - there is an animated sequence at the beginning to establish the story. This nicely done sequence is more reminiscent of Kamal Hassan's underrated psycho-serial-killer thriller Abhay.The movie is also quite violent by regular standards - Captain sends John his wife's sliced finger to get him going...The most amazing part of the movie for me was it's songs (but obviously coming from this director), especially the title song: Tera Hi Karam. Shot with John in a heavy depression and being played on all sides, it shows him as down in the dumps as possible with all the other characters getting their own highs. The whole sequence is done in slo-mo, with John in one end of the screen standing head-down in heavy heavy rain. There's a guy at the other end of the screen whipping himself on a bare back (some people do that to punish themselves). This is inter-cut with the perversions of the villains : Captain's got a car battery wired to his temples and gives himself shocks; Yunus (another gangsta) is dressed in ladies underwear and is feeling himself and dancing in front of a mirror (whoa!!). Has something even half as 'dark' as this ever been shown on Indian Cinama screens? Although the movie is below a well-made movie, but it is the effort that is very much visible and gets the movie its marks. You know that the director can do better next time 'round. Here's hoping he does, and stays in the dark territory.My Rating ---> 3 of 5" 
" The reward for a good Karam","I thought this might be a fairly disposable action movie, but it's not, it's a very dramatic action movie with a wonderfully sharp script done full justice by an excellent cast. It is very stylized in places but with finesse, nothing looks excessive or gratuitous but rather serves the story.John Abraham fits right into the role of the protagonist. He really accentuates the vulnerability of the character which adds a lot to his plight. Priyanka Chopra also does a great job with the character. One of her best performances maybe. Shiny Ahuja also delivers, adding another perspective to the story.The film is perfectly paced, never letting up or getting distracted with side-stories. The songs are well implemented and serve the themes effortlessly. The first song "Tinka Tinka" is wonderfully subdued yet stirring and will stick with the viewer for long after viewing the movie." 
" superb!","I say the director was quite ambitious when he undertook the making of this film but i feel it paid off. The Indian audience are usually used to the 'masala ' type of movies which incorporates a little bit of everything and is not a bad thing at all (heck i was attracted to Bollywood movies for the very same masala!) so don't get me wrong. However this film offers something different, variety; which is sticking to one genre. What stood out for me the most; besides the brilliant acting of Priyanka , John and Shiny (all three are very talented and quite under rated performers) was the ambiance of the whole film. It was a dark tale of guilt and need for salvation...a noir and i think the director got it the 'T', specially in the song 'Tera Hi Karam'; which is full of shadows and 'blackness' which reflects the inner turmoil of the character 'John' and seems to follow him everywhere!I mean his closed are black and white (quite abstract and not as simple as it seems). The only elements of colour and light in his life are those in which his wife 'Shalini is a part of (that is, in the song and... actually in the film itself! ). However the colour and light seems to be threatened by shadows and darkness such as when ACP Singh searches John's house, you can hardly see any light and colour as it is half engulfed in darkness . The portrait of Shalini is half in shadow (perhaps a metaphor for the situation she is in or the shadow representing John himself and the effect he has on the life of his loved ones). I thought it had justified ending though I can understand why some people might get frustrated with it . Overall , i think people should give it a go and watch it with open minds and a clean slate and try not to read and judge using rigidly the conventions of traditional Indian cinema that most people are used to and it might surprise you and you'll find yourself enjoying it. Besides I am a big Shiny Ahuja fan so i might be a tad bit biased into trying to get you guys to watch it. It might just be your cup of tea xx" 
" An excellent story","A very beautiful love story... And a painful too.... Overall its new kind of love story... And John and priyanka look so good" 
" This movie was alright","This movie is basically a copy of The Mexican. Total waste of time don't bother watching itAgain this movie is just another rip off of some Hollywood movie so there is no point on explaining it. If you want to watch it go ahead it is about a guy who is a sniper for the mob who wants to quit but has to do one last job. To make sure he finishes it the mob kidnap his fiancé so he decides to do it. (The reason he wants to stop is because he accidentally slaughtered a family)And the rest is self explanatory. Just another lame copy of a Hollywood movie but who am i to stop uI give this movie a 4/10 at least they tried to copy The Mexican" 
" Piece of crap!!!!!","Still i am giving the film 4 out of 10 just because of the music and some what mediocre-ly cinematography! This might be a copy of The Mexican which i have seen and loved, but some how the director has managed to make the film look very illogical! Pointless melodramatic moments! Stupid wife just keeps talking about the flooring in their new house!!Movie is crap because of the makers! If this is an first time attempt which i think it is then it is a very good attempt. The narrative is quite unique for Indian film industry standards! This itself demands respect for the makers!John acted well!!! So did Priyanka!!!! But the music and the songs are original and just plain heavenly!!!!" 
" An underrated action thriller with a soul.","Karam is indeed an impressive, dark action thriller that has a somewhat familiar-looking story of a hitman who wants to quit his job but as it unfolds, you realize it's not that simple as it might initially seem. Thanks to the DVD covers and many posters, most viewers would have thought of it as another Bollywood romance, which it isn't. Interlaced with sharp dialogues, stunning action sequences and powerful performances, Karam is a poetic actioner that has to be seen at least once in life.If you are a fan of John Abraham and want to see how his earlier action roles were, this is indeed a good film to start with. A lot of set pieces have the Mission: Impossible feel to them and are brilliantly executed. It's absolutely jam-packed with action, and the drama that follows it along with some really good songs is also praiseworthy.I really had no idea that the famous "Tinka Tinka Zara Zara" song is from this film!Performance wise, everyone delivers. The casting couldn't have got any better than this. What's also surprising is that while the film has a fair share of violent action and mature themes, it has almost no profanity in it, which is great given the film's theme. Also, the visual work is at times impressive, especially in John's introductory sequence. Editing is top notch as the film runs just a little less than 2 hours. The characters are written in a way that you'll remember them for quite a time.I feel this film is quite underrated. Critics bashed the film at the time of its release, and it wasn't a box office hit. Thankfully, viewers today are realizing the film's potential. On the whole, Karam is a terrific action thriller that has to be seen if you like action films and John Abraham. Plus, I would recommend seeing the uncut version first. It's available on internet, while the DVD version is cut." 
" Poor imitation of Hollywood films","Karam is a poor imitation of Hollywood films. The elements of a Hollywood film revolving around crime have been used to not much avail.A deadly hit-man decides to turn over a new leaf after he accidentally kills a child in an attempt to eliminate his boss' enemies, but his wicked boss will not hear of it, and even holds the protagonists' wife hostage until the job is complete.The acting is immature many a time. The actors are not showing frustration and anger naturally. At times the film is play-like.Initial portrayal of the protagonist as a handsome, efficient and smart hit-man is good and makes you wanna expect more, but then the role turns weak.There are 2 catchy songs, and there are some remarkable stunts.The editing is Weak. There are flaws in costumes also.Grotesque stuff has been shown to give the film a punch of emotion, but its still a weak portrayal. Dialogues are not strong.Shiny Ahuja probably has the best role.But the film ultimately lives up to its title..karma.Moral: crime never pays" 
" An average Bollywood flick","The trailer was really promising but the film fails to deliver it uses the Collateral concept and various other films.The action is far to fantasy like and the actors aren't familiar with the word 'Over-acting'.The gangsters are laughable and Priyanka Chopra is really annoying and is a times unbearable.And here is the plot.John is a assassin looking to go straight but his ex-boss doesn't take this with ease and blackmails John in carrying out five hits on five rival crime bosses.Bollywood however has its up the song Tera hi karam is very charming and dark and is very sad.However I found the gay gangster a change to the normal gangsters of Indian movies.Good try."
