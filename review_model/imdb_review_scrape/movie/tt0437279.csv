" one of the most stupid films I have seen","Khamoshh strives to be a psychological thriller and honestly i was looking forward to its release. But all my expectations were marred when i watched this movie.The biggest undoing of the movie is its editing department. The editor must be sleeping while doing his job. Because you can't tell whether you are seeing a flashback or the present situation in the film. The way the director tries to blend the present and the past is just ridiculous. The climax is a major letdown after the identity of the killer is revealed. The killer's identity will make you question the sanity of the director who puts no effort to make it appear convincing to the viewer.If you've seen the Hollywood flick 'Identity', then you don't need to watch this film. I think the original wasn't that good either. Acting is weak except for the gorgeous Shilpa Shetty and the talented Juhi Chawla. But they don't get enough footage to prove their worth. The script is inane and weak. There is only one song in this movie and is nothing to write home about. One word i would use to describe this film "stupid!!!". Don't waste your time watching it!" 
" A Clone of the movie: Identity(2003)","The night when this happened was a stormy night with fearful weather conditions when strangers came together to a motel. Various people who were by passing through this highway when the weather was giving way got diverted to this motel, which seemed to be their only hope for survival through such unforeseen circumstances.A family encounters a flat tire while they are traveling on a highway. Due to the stormy weather conditions they meet with a fatal accident wherein the wife is brutally hit. They are left with no choice but to take her to the nearest available place where they can find some medical aid. But to their misery they are brought to this motel where their life undergoes trauma.Also arriving in the same motel is a young couple Avinash-Mahek (Rajiv Singh-Kainaaz) who were on the way to their honeymoon. Due to the unfortunate weather conditions, they get diverted to the same motel. Others who arrive at the motel include a prostitute  Sonia (Shilpa Shetty), a Starlet  Kashmira (Rakhi Sawant) whose car earlier bumped off the woman and her secretary.The receptionist Adi (Vrajesh Hirjee) somehow manages to accommodate all of them, in various rooms.After having the guests stationed in respectable rooms, another car comes in due to unforeseen weather conditions wherein a cop  Jatin (Shahwar Ali) is on his way to another prison. He is transferring one of the convicts (Kelly Dorjee), who is along with him, to another prison. He is also eventually given a temporary shelter in this Motel, where in the convict is brought in the room, wrapped in handcuffs.Alls well till a point of time until murders start happening at this Motel. One after the other they find each one being killed by a person or a spirit. The mystery of deaths unveils with each guest being killed by somebody and their room keys are placed to ensure the guest count.The fear amongst everyone embarks with doubts encroaching them. Each one gets furious over the happenings, and wants to escape death.Thus the film is a psychological thriller, where the audience is on the edge of their seat. Hunting for the hunted.Is it a person, a spirit, a soul, a ghost? The film also stars Juhi Chawla, Rajat Bedi, Vishwajeet Pradhan, Avtar Gill, Raju Shreshta and Gargi Patel. Khamosh is produced by Rahul Aggarwal and Deepak Tijori and directed by Deepak Tijori."While comparing with the movie Identity everything in this move is same except the fact that it got songs and Indian cast. This ending was slightly changed, but other than that everything is just the same"" 
" its a remake of "Identity 2003"","its a remake of "Identity 2003".I've seen movies like this before. The kind of thing where the whole plot is based on what a person sees, and it ends up being in their head. But Identity goes way overboard with it. Nothing is real at all.I liked the basic story before everything got all trippy. The story of a killer among a bunch of seemingly normal people. Then the whole, "You're actually a crazy person in a mental institute and people think you should die, so prove them wrong", thing kicks in.If the rest of the movie lived up to what I like from the first hour or so, then I would recommend it, but the movie fails, and fails bad." 
" Not Identity","Whoever said this was the same as Identity must have slept through Identity. All the characters in Identity are a figment in the crazed mind of the one real character. Khamosh Kauff Ki Raat is NOT like that. If anything, its less far out. I don't know that this is the best movie that any of these actors made, but I think that can be established without dragging out that tired weary criticism of metooism. I think the main thing to do is compare it to Identity. I'd say both movies are equally good or equally bad (or even equally mediocre). But Bollywood fans should just drop the copycat critique. It is not film criticism at all. If you think a movie is bad, you should at least do your homework and state in detail what made it that way. Don't take the lazy way out by calling it a copycat movie." 
" Meet the sexy Dr. Sakshi Saagar and sensational Ms. Sonia","Woah! I just finished watching Khamoshh Khauff ki Raat! The movie was much better than I thought it to be. It's exactly like 'Identity' until the very end. I thought this one had a better ending. Of course the main reason why I watched it was Juhi and Shilpa and I'm glad that they shared the screen too! Anyway, Juhi plays a psychiatrist, a very sexy one! I mean she wasn't playing a seductress or anything like that but man, even as a dedicated psychiatrist, she can stop your heart from beating. I have yet to see a sexier psychiatrist in Bollywood cinema! Sridevi played one in Kaun Sachcha Kaun Jhootha but she wasn't really a dedicated psychiatrist because she went against the ethics by seducing Rishi Kapoor. Anyway, watch Khamoshh. It's really not as bad as people made it out to be! Next to Juhi, there's the amazing Shilpa who even performs an erotic foreplay number. Both actresses (as usual) performed well too besides being hot!" 
" Weak performances and storyline","Despite having such a large star cast, Khamoshh fails to live up to expectations. Except for Shilpa Shetty and the girl who plays the famous actress, all the performances are not that impressive. The girl who keeps on saying "Hum sab marenge" is really irritating. The dangerous killer's "menacing" grins are quite comical. It's really sickening when the actual culprit is revealed. The movie also ends on an unpleasant note. However, one thing I did like about the movie is the fashion in which it is told. A shocking event occurs out of the blue, and then the film reverts to a flashback to explain that occurrence. Then, within that flashback the same thing happens resulting in a flashback within a flashback and so on. It's something very new in Bollywood. This technique does a good job in speeding up the pace of the movie." 
" Don't watch it till the End","Plot Outline: An accident involving a movie star's car and a family on a stormy night starts off a chain of events where ten strangers including a rich prostitute, a cop transporting a criminal, and a couple on their way to honeymoon are forced to stay at a desolate wayside Logde manned by a cranky receptionist. Soon terror starts with mysterious killings in a nail biting suspense.Comment: Khamosh is a direct lift from Hollywood's Identity (2003). After Deepak Tijori's previous flop Oops, he needs to say 'Oops' this time again as this movie is already out of the movie halls. Performance apart, although a lot of people might not have seen 'Identity', Khamosh can be described as a good effort in portraying 'Khauf' on screen. The suspense is carefully built through the story. The final let-off however, comes with a badly scripted and shoddily executed ending. The movie wouldn't have cost much considering the second rung star-cast with the exceptions Shilpa Shetty and Juhi Chawla. Music is listless and the songs are irrelevant." 
" its not too bad not too good","I THINK ITS NOT A VERY GOOD REMAKE OF IDENTITY .BUT IT KEEPS YOU GUESSING TILL END . I HAVE WATCHED IDENTITY 11 TIMES , SO I CAN SAY 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER . BUT YOU CAN WATCH IT IF YOU ARE FED UP WITH TYPICAL BOLLYWOOD MOVIES.I THINK DEEPAK SIR DID A GREAT JOB, ALL CHARACTERS DID A GREAT JOB . OVERALL 
7/10" 
" Another interesting movie on split personality but a dup of Hollywood","Movie is very interesting from the start to end. I haven't seen the original movie Identity-from which this movie made. But this is much better than Mahesh Bhatt style seductive cloning of English thrillers. Only two songs bore us least and movie goes in nice flow. All relatively junior star caste has done good job, Rajiv Singh(his debut movie), Vrajesh Hirji, Vishwajeet Pradhan impress with their role. Shilpa Shetty got the role which she suits while Juhi has done her bit well. I wish Dipak Tijori could have played some role. I have special admiration for Rajivsingh, he looks smart and acted well for the first movie. End is bit strange and I would have liked some more reasoning of the way movie was ended."
