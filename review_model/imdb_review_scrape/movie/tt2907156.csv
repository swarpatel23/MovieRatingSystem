" Okay film","The film is yet another addition to films set in Delhi, This time with newcomers sadly it went unnoticed. The film has a okay story but could have been better yet it does have some good moments. The film tells a story of a boy Anuj Saxena who does plays to earn money while our heroine is a Punjabi typical girl who makes Parathey. The love story though slow does involve you, things get serious in between and the end too is good maybe a bit abrupt. The film could've been done with more pathos, somehow something feels missing in the big pictureDirection is decent Music is okayAnuj Saxena makes a comeback to films after a disaster CLICK, he earlier used to act in TV serials like KKUSUM, KUMKUM.etc and always had a pathetic dialogue delivery and used to fumble across, seeing him on big screen, he does show improvement and plays his part with restraint though too much laidback for the role and his dialogue delivery is still bad Neha Pawar plays the typical Punjabi girl and she does well however she suffers due to poor voice modulation and over excitedness. rest mostly unknown faces are OK" 
" sweet movie","'Paranthe wali gali' (PWG) is a romcom set against the backdrop of the beautiful Old Delhi. This movie does justice to Old Delhi by showing the real Old Delhi. While watching the movie you will feel that you are there and the sight/mention of the many paratha's (food) will literally make your mouth water. PWG is a sweet movie, and you can definitely watch it with your whole family (it is a clean movie). Neha Pawar and Anuj Saxena did a brilliant job. Neha Pawar reminded me of Suvreen Guggal (Channel V's drama) in this movie. Her acting was flawless, and I couldn't have guessed that it was her debut film if I hadn't read it in an article. The music of this movie is amazing, especially the song 'tere bin na ho sakega guzara'. I wish that you will like this movie as much as I did."
