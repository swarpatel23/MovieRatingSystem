" A Sunday well spent...!","My Sunday was well spent watching this movie. For the first time, a gripping show of comedy, brilliant suspense, and of course a good and unique storyline. Rohit Shetty proves that even he exists in the filming world! Not literally, but metaphorically speaking... The soundtrack is also good, lets say 7.5/10. This movie will have you gripped till the last frame. Ajay Devgan suits almost everywhere - tragedy, comedy or action. He proves it in Halla Bol and now Sunday. Ayesha Takia is brilliant, perhaps in my eyes her first good performance. Arshad Warsi as usual flawlessly impresses you. The screenplay is good, cinematography flawless, and editing brilliant! All in all, to put it in a nutshell, a brilliant take for 60 bucks, and i mean BRILLIANT! Don't miss the chance next Sunday and get your ticket, and run for it! Its not many times you get such a show... You know what I mean." 
" Sunday - good film...with good comedy","When i first saw the trailer i was man this looks so stupid. Then after it was released my dad was like lets go watch it. And i agreed. Best thing i did that day. I actually went to see the film on a Sunday and i was impressed. What looked like stupidity in the trailers was actually pure comedy and the story was very unusual and bizarre which i liked because this film didn't just copy something but actually made it good. I don't think the idea is completely original but still its pretty good. I liked Ayesha Takias acting. She shows her emotions well and Ajay Devgan was a bit annoying after a while when constantly eating ice cream and that. The songs were good especially Manzil and Kash ye Kash hai and it was obvious that the director wanted to show off his cool camera tricks that he had learnt and it was done a bit over the top but overall the acting throughout was good and so was the story. Arshad and Irfan were truly hilarious and i was a bit worried this was going to turn into some weird film when the rape drug was mentioned, then it was OK after the explanation so i was like phew! I liked the theme tune lol when the action starts and you can hear Sunday being repeated in the background. Definitely worth the watch....you don't want to miss this Sunday" 
" Sunday : A confused thriller with good comedy sequences","Sunday : In a straight review Sunday is not what you expect after seeing the promising promos. It's a mixture of thriller and comedy sequences. Whereas the comedy sequences are highly enjoyable, there is no thrill in the suspense and murder mystery element of the script. The film is said to be a remake of a HIT Telugu film ANUKOKUNDA OKA ROJU [2005]. The Telugu original must be more enjoyable fare as it was a big hit but the Hindi version lacks the right punch needed for a blockbuster. In fact director Rohit Shetty seems confused in whether to make a comedy film or a fast paced thriller. Many plots and characters are deliberately inserted, which are clearly spotted by a average film-goer too. For instance : 1. Ajay Devgan's character of a ice cream eating cop is the most unimpressive one. He just plays the role and doesn't seem to be interested in the movie at all. 2. The murder mystery has no surprise element in it as some unknown character just enters the climax as the main culprit. 3. The most disappointing thing is that Irfan Khan, an actor of endless capabilities has got no definite role and he is just included in the movie to add to its project value. He has no involvement in the script and is just wasted as a comedy character. However it is his own brilliance that he again comes up as the best thing in the movie with his excellent comic timing. 4. Even Arshad Warsi, is not given the mileage he needed and he is also just another character in the script. 5. The action sequences on the actual locations of Chandni Chowk, Delhi and the item number of "Esha Deol" are clearly added as the last moment insertions. The director could have easily avoided them. 6. Ayesha Takia working as Cartoon Dubbing artist is given unwanted footage. She just acts in the movie as a routine work. The script surely has a new concept, but is not handled in a promising manner. Music is also below average.. The only enjoyable moments in the movie are the scenes with Arshad Warsi & Irfan Khan. They both are highly entertaining together and the viewer keeps waiting for them to come on screen again. In all, Sunday is certainly not a good thriller movie but can only be seen once for the comedy by the talented pair Â– Arshad Warsi & Irfan Khan." 
" Sunday on a Sunday","Sunday is the movie about a missing Sunday.Sehar (Ayesha Takia) is a dubbing artist for cartoon movies. Everything is going normal until one day when she misses a Sunday from her life. She doesn't remember anything about what has happened on that Sunday.She started feeling the missing day, when she feels her life in danger when she gets attacked by some strangers. She starts feeling when strangers starts hounding her for various things happened on that particular Sunday. SP Rajveer (Ajay Devgan) tries to help her out to solve the mystery of the missing Sunday.What happens on the Sunday is a mystery until the last reel of the movie. It's one of those who dunnit mystery but presented well by the director. Worth watching." 
" Average","Having watched the promos of this movie, I was looking forward to watching this movie.Sohar Thapar has a big problem and that is she forgets what she has done, sometimes her belongings and sometimes that she has to meet people. But one night, after leaving a disco with her friend Ritu, she wakes up only to see that it is Monday. But what is worse for her is that when she goes into the city, she accidentally meets a taxi driver who, she thinks, is following her. But he only asks her for the fares that she owes him. She also meets ACP Rajveer Randhava, who, she is informed is a suitable person for her to marry. However, she soon finds out that he is a corrupt Police officer. But then then she faces more serious problems when she realises that she is not able to remember what had happened to her on "Sunday." She asks ACP Randhava for his assistance.After the success of "Golmal," this is Rohit Shetty's second venture with Ajay Devgan. The movie also stars Ayesha Takia, Arshad Warsi, Irfan Khan, Ali Asgar (of Balaji Telefilms's Kamal of "Kahani Ghar Ghar Kii) and Deepak Qazir (of Balaji Telefims Bapuji of "Kahani Ghar Ghar Kii" and "Kasauti Zindagi Kii".) Tushar Kapur and Esha Deol make a special appearance for item songs. What this film has highlighted is the situation regarding date rape drugs, which in forensic science, is very hard to trace when taking a sample after being raped. But this is a comedy / thriller movie genre and Ajay Devgan and Ayesha Takia are okay in this movie. But the two actors, that have saved the movie from being a total disaster are Arshad Warsi and Irfan Khan with their comedy.In some ways this movie has been a disappointment and more so after watching the promos, which to me, indicate that the PR and the marketing of the this has operated in the most appropriate manner.Conclusion: Disappointing but can be viewed with family." 
" Rohit can do it better than this!","I was pining high hopes on Rohit Shetty after I watched his highly deserved, less-acclaimed "Zameen". Sunday seemed more suited for two- episodes suspense thriller on telly. The plot is paper-thin and execution is bad. And if this is a direct copy of the Telugu movie "Anukokunda Oka Roju", then shame on you Rohit!!!The comedy track between Irfan Khan and Arshad Warsi does evoke a few laughs. The senti OTT, lend me a shoulder story of Arshad Warsi is unwarranted.Performance wise, all were good. Ajay Devgan, Ayesha Takia, Ifran Khan, Arshad Warsi etc. But in all honesty doesn't deserve such a huge ensemble.Ajay Devgan and Mukesh Tiwar's gay poking are not in good light.Songs are good. The suspense was bad (read childish!)." 
" Wholesome Entertainment","Watch out for Rohit Shetty. His movies are too good all the time. They are always so entertaining. He always cats Ajay Devgan, who is a very good actor and has shown that he can do whatever role he is given, no matter how difficult it is. He also makes it look believable, like it is just natural for him. However, he was not the one who impressed me the most. The main star of the show was Arshad Warsi. He is a natural- born comedian. His facial expressions and dialogues are so good. His chemistry with Irfan Khan is amazing. All of their scenes together are so hilarious, especially the scene where they follow the goons into the garage to save Ayesha and Irfan closes the door. Ayesha played her role very well too. She is another actress to look out for. She is far better than actresses like Aishwarya Rai, who is always overacting or not even acting. There is something wrong with bollywood. They give awards to the worst actors and actresses. In my opinion, films like Halla Bol, Sunday, Zameen, and Johnny Gaddar that were all box office failures are the best. Another thing that is good about Rohit Shetty's films is that in his films, there is always great chemistry between all of the actors, but the best chemistry is between only 2 of them. In Zameen it was between Ajay Devgan and Abhishek Bachchan. In Golmaal it was between Tusshar Kapoor and Sharman Joshi. And in this movie, it was between Arshad Warsi and Irrfan Khan. Also, all three of his movie are awesome and very entertaining with outstanding performances." 
" Watch Sunday only if you have nothing else to do on Sunday","After a successful "Golmaal" Rohit Shetty's latest venture is Sunday. With an impressive star cast of Ajay Devgan,Arshad Warsi, Irfan Khan and Ayesha Takia, Sunday looked pretty strong in its promos. I was quite excited about the movie after watching the promos, my only fear was Tushar Kapur, but I thanked god when his name appeared as Special thanks. Well it's difficult to give a black and white review of Sunday. You can't call it an outright winner and not a complete waste of time either. It will definitely fall among the better category of humor of recent times. But still you will have some disappointments. Sunday is a comedy-thriller where the thrill part is a major let down. Sehar (Ayesha Takia) is a dubbing artist (thank god not an Advertising professional or journalist an innovative profession for sure) living in Delhi who is unable to recall the accounts of one Sunday. She remembers going to a night club on Saturday and going for a movie on Monday but one Sunday is missing. Ayesha Takia desperately wants to find out what happened on that day, well if one is chased by reckless goons who wouldn't. Strange people acts weirdly around her after that one missing Sunday. Ajay Devgan is a Cop and prospective fiancÃ©e of Sehar. A Taxi driver (Arshad Warsi) and a struggling actor ( Irfan Khan) are looking for Sehar and asking for 420 rupaye. Ajay Devgan tries to solve this mystery one missing Sunday. The real hero of Sunday are Arshad Warsi and Irfan Khan, the timing is impeccable, the chemistry is outstanding and when they both are together on screen they give you moments which will make you laugh out loud. The jokes are very situational and it's the sheer brilliance of Arshad and Irfan who instigate a touch of excellence. The first genuine hilarious scene comes in with the entry of Irfan khan and after that both of them never go down. One scene when Irfan Khan is dressed up as Ravana and the scene where Sehar scares the hell out of both of them are moments of great fun or the HR parody. Most of the other actors look desperate to make you laugh. Ajay Devgan's new found love for flaunting his cleavage is beyond my understanding and somehow he was not at all fit for the role. All the time it looks like he is fighting hard to be funny but not quite there. Ayesha Takia was not given the responsibility to make you laugh. Her job was to look pretty all the time and scared sometimes. It was nice to see that she lost some weight after her Miss Thunder Thighs and Hooters appearance in No Smoking, still there is a long way to go. Vrijesh Hirjee's accent might make you smile for the first time after that he just drags. Many side characters are put in for no good reason. Sunday is confused, there are few scenes which just appear out of no where and they don't make any sense. Arshad Warsi's emotional revelation of his kidney problem is one of the most stupid thing Rohit Shetty could have done. But good thing is every time after all the mayhem and stupidity Arshad and Irfan come on screen to clean up the mess. In the second half Sunday changes tracks to be a thriller still there are good doses of laughs. But the thriller part is the most ridiculous suspense you could have ever imagined. When the whole mystery breaks you feel like why it all started in the firs place. Casting that cute little bump as the villain clearly shows budget constraints or may be Rohit Shetty was smoking "Classic Milds". A major let down on the movie is its screenplay. Sunday is full of worthless song placed in the worst possible situations. To add to the agony the music is nothing but great. Rohit Shetty fumbles in all the romanticize sequences and the chemistry between the lead stars never builds up. In the end I will say if you have some extra cash and some extra cash give Sunday a try for the sake of Irfan Khan and Arshad Warsi's outstanding performances. Otherwise even if you miss this unlike Sehar you are not missing anything.I am gonna give Sunday 2.5/5" 
" It happened one night....","Billed as a suspense-comic thriller, this one's a ho-hum in more ways than one. Rohit Golmaal Shetty just couldn't decide what he wanted out of his otherwise-talented cast, he messes up the recipe and throws the whole kitchen sink at you. The problem: the sink stinks.Devgan has to act a cool cop: so he licks ice cream all day. Warsi and Irrfan Khan drive around Delhi in a red car, which you are never likely to see in Delhi. Ayesha, who starts well, looks puffed up and lost in the bizarre plot, which is set in Delhi but you'd excused to think that the action was taking place in a one-car town with a population of 40.The suspense and the thriller elements are duds; some comic scenes however lighten up the proceeds. Shetty cant handle the romance between an ageing Devgan and a fresh but puffy Ayesha; the songs are dull and their filming moron. Makes you wait for the bits when Warsi appears, because he has the funniest lines, and Irrfan who feeds off his cues. These two make a good comic team who try hard to carry off the film to some extent.Shetty tries to put in too many items in the movie: from chases in a crowded Chandni Chowk to a gang of thugs led by a cartoon-voiced fellow to a Vrajesh Hirjee, a Karate expert speaking in a Malayalee accent without rhyme or reason. What actually happens to Ayesha is so prosaic, its not worth the effort of making a whole film about! The cinematography by Aseem Bajaj is good, especially his filming of famous landmarks in Delhi. The digital fusion of various scenes has been seamlessly carried out. Music is noisy, the background score is shrieky.Ajay Devgan looks listless trying to be cool, Ayesha Takia opens confidently in a well-crafted sequence of dubbing for an animation flick but loses vapour immediately thereafter. It is left to the highly talented due of Arshad Warsi and Irrfan Khan to provide some relief in the banal proceedings.There has been no movie last week, there is none next. Yet this movie played to empty seats on a Saturday." 
" Sunday not a FUN DAY","This film ruined my Sunday :) Actually the film is so horrible that it hurtsThis is become a trend now to make a hit film 1) Take some stupid plot and try to make it a thriller and a comedy too 2) Take actors like Ajay Devgan, Arshad Warsi 3) Put lot of action, comedy everythingThe movie is actually a jumble of all sorts Suddenly Ajay is a serious cop and a funny cop suddenly? Suddenly Arshad Warsi becomes serious for 1 sceneThere are some funny scenes like the ghost night in the cab but thats it The story is as simplistic and stupid as a CID episodeThe director tries to create suspense but baffles people everything he switches genre and everything falls flat The climax is one of the biggest jokes Rohit Shetty's direction is confusing though some scenes are good Music is okayAmongst performances Ayesha Takia is natural in her role and gives her best thankfully she isn't just giggling or smiling mostly like in other films Ajay tries hard to play a funny cop but fails, his ice cream cone thing is bad, but he is okay in some scenes Mukesh Tiwari seems better then him in comedy Arshad Warsi is funny at places Irrfan Khan is wasted but he does manage some good scenes Ali Asgar is so unintentionally hilarious that he proves that TV actors should not act in films" 
" Bollywood running out of sane people","I don't know how on earth this movie ever made it to the theaters..i mean come on, there's no proper story line, all the extras were over-acting, Ajay Devgan's entry is a scene of him walking in slow motion thru a bunch of flying red chillies(i have no idea what that signifies),Ayesha Takia dubs for ALL characters in an animation feature(what the..?), discos with synchronized dance!!? That garbage of an actor Tusshar Kapoor was put in for god knows what, and danced like a spastic and went away.by the way, i felt his entry was pretty dramatic too.they showed his stomach and groin first.Bad choreography, bad wardrobe(when Ayesha wears ethnic Indian dresses in the songs, Ajay Devgan's always got his mammoth shades on, and is wearing multicolored slim-fit clothes).Songs aren't great either.They only song that made it to radio channels is 'manzar'.And what the hell is with the dumb long haired hit-man???what language does he speak in? is that supposed to be funny? or scary?who laughs for stuff like that? same goes for the 'comedian' in the movie. The 'south-indian' karate instructor.No one in the theater was laughing for his jokes,let alone his absolutely ridiculous accent."Suhasineeeee! Meine Tumse Pyaar Kiyaaaa!!! Lekin Tumne Mujhe Dhoka Diyaaa!!!KABLAM!!" used to work back in the 70s, i think.Arshad Warsi and the his sidekick are garbage again.the movie could've done without them.last but not least, they HAVE to have a RIDICULOUS 'thing' for all heroes eh? either they're chewing on toothpicks or they're constantly wiping sweat of their foreheads or playing with guns or running their fingers thru their hair(in slow-motion of course).The Sunday guys found a 'better' one.A hero who keeps munching on ice-cream all the time.Very heroic, i should say.One of the WORST movies I've ever seen.total waste of time and money." 
" Watch "Sunday" only on Sunday when you are Free","I hardly criticize any movie, and this is one of them. Although Sunday is not exactly a comedy but it's hilarious scenes are not that impressive, but instead irritating and boring. Of course Rohit has his own methods and ideas of making a comedy movie, but in the sense that I am an audience - I cannot remark him positively like Priyadarshan or David Dhawan. The reason is that whenever I sit to watch either Dhawan or Priyadarshan's comedy movie I get exhausted of laughing and sometimes I need to drink water to feel free again. Whereas for Rohit Shetty's comedies, instead of getting laughed I get irritated. His previous comedy Golmaal was more useless with an absence of proper subject. There all the characters seemed stereotypically like dummies. This time it has a little bit of subject, still then it really fails to touch (or win) the heart.In the beginning I considered and was shocked seeing Ajay Devgan as a corrupted ACP, but later for her love's sake he avoids it and so I could breathe freely. The title of the movie also seems too odd, although it is based on the story. Rohit has a good understanding with Ajay for which he has taken him even in his third venture after Zameen and Golmaal. After watching Sunday one more thing I cannot determine in Bollywood - why they make all the action scenes like using robots in place of human being? Therefore, it is 50 years backward from Hollywood.Rohit Shetty is much advanced and unique in making action and thriller movies rather than comedies which he did in his debut Zameen. It was superbly made with a true subject on terrorism and its problems with Kashmir and Pakistan. That's why I cannot imagine as Sunday is made by Rohit Shetty again, because it is too far in standard and maturity as compared to Zameen. I could only be impressed by some cases where the true nature of corrupted police and politicians (in climax) are explained with good examples. The chemistry between matured Ajay and childish typed Ayesha is really worse, even her case with John Abraham in No Smoking. She looks like their younger sister and not girlfriend. Undoubtedly I really give a good *star to Arshad Warshi and Irfan Khan for their every step improvements in performing comedian role. In others' cases I have nothing to point out. That's it!!!"
