" Decent movie with good performances by the lead actors","We have seen several movies where a girl is set to marry an anonymous person as groom. But this girl meets this stranger boy by an accident. They have interesting talks, they spend some time together, and they fall in love. The girl finally realizes that it is this stranger who is the actual love of her life and the stranger boy develops the same feeling for the girl. So the concept of the movie is not that new. But on the positive side, the writer managed to add an extra-twist in the end, and this twist makes this movie different from the others in the category.Now coming over to performances, the actors played their part natural for the most part. The good performances by the lead actors keep you spell-bound till the end.Direction was good too. Although this is a low-budget movie, the irregularities often visible in movies with limited budget, was not visible.Dialogues were witty and funny for the most part and yet there were occasions when they reminded me of 'Before Sunrise'.Songs were somewhat okay. Not great, yet they blended quite well in the movie. Still I wished that there was at least one memorable song in the movie. For such movies there should be at least one song which the audience keep humming even after they are finished watching the movie.Overall, this movie is a well made movie. Indeed, a great family entertainment for all ages." 
" Copied and degraded version of Original movie","This movie is copied from a Marathi movie named "Mumbai Pune Mumbai". The movie is set in Delhi. A girl from Mumbai visits Delhi to meet (and potentially reject) the guy selected for her by her parents. In the original Marathi movie the guy belongs to Pune city. Even tough this movie has a different city the dialogs are mostly copied and do not aptly denote the charm and flavors of Delhi city and its youth. The acting is descent but in patches. The direction and cinematography is also decently good. It is good that the movie was recreated in Hindi for a larger audience as the Original movie was brilliant. But sadly this movie does not live up to the quality of the original movie." 
" Excellent","Good movie. Not boring. Entertaining with dialogs and really nice movie. I recommend to see. It's a movie to the people who like gentleman's comedy and also, one day stories. Good to watch. Pia played the role of "Bawari" Mumbai Girl, with her own story, who came to Delhi to meet the groom, whom she had already rejected in mind, just by hearing to the place where he lives, Delhi. She loses her phone and meets a stranger, a boy who helps her and finally, she gets the number and when trying by the boy's phone to call the groom. Guys, watch it. Good movie, by the director of Superhit Marathi Movie, Mumbai Pune Mumbai. Both the lead protagonists played well. The movie doesn't have a Main Supporting Roles. The whole movie revolves around these guys."
