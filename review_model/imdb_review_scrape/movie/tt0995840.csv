" A Complete Disgrace","I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last!!!) to see this film. Where do I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction of course was the soundtrack. Which goes without saying is brilliant - it's what Himesh does best. But as they say, don't give up your day job - HR definitely shouldn't.HR's acting is plain and simply awful. Even if the film had a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there. Two words of advice to HR - give up acting and secondly, use chapstick.HR has no screen presence, no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him. As for Malika Sherawat - just the same old Bollywood vamp crap. You can package the product as much as you want, but if there's no substance it won't hold. Don't waste your money..." 
" Too pathetically made that it becomes fun to watch","If you feel Reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV, try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is bland all throughout the movie, and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes. This is way far from a real love story (Get the spelling right, Reshammiya - it is not luv or reeal), and is complete with him doing a Mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fight scenes, Himesh getting imprisoned, Himesh accused of murder, he fleeing from prison etc ... If you want a good laugh, there is nothing like this one, especially the scenes where he howls in Mehbooba. If you despise the nasal twangs, and want to know out of curiosity what two hours of Reshammiya can do to you, then don't miss this movie.I couldn't stop laughing from the beginning till the very end. The only saving grace that this movie has are the cinematography, locations, and a couple of the songs. Even then, until you are a die hard Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs." 
" Aap Ka Ghuroor!??","Ego. Seems it's the only reason this movie was made. This movie is so wrong in so many ways that it's below one's dignity to write much about it. Every character was only good at self praise and lead actors (i use this term liberally as has the director) emote in the likeness of stone. the little story, if that, fails on the basic aspects such as logic, feeling and drama. Direction leaves much to be desired. blatant flaws are all over the place (character motives aren't defined, prospective husbands are found overnight, broken car windows mend themselves among other things)Let's face it, Himesh can't act. neither, it seems, can Hansika Motwani. In her defense, she's still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of make-up. Raj Babbar Overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a bit too much. The actor who plays Himesh's friend is the only natural. a few questions do come to mind: how can such a film cost Rs.500,000,000?? where did the money go??? granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and Mallika Sherawat was paid an obscene Rs.15,000,000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs. but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind. (including 3 Mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police car)the good: Himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark "topi." Let's give the Devil his due: Himesh, as usual gives good music.The bad: Direction, Story, Himesh's singing is still hard to ignoreThe Ugly: Dialogs and everything else!!!Final Word: Painful in every sense of the word! watch this movie only if you loved Subhash Ghai's "Yaadein"" 
" A crow does not become a peacock with it's feathers !","Whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time ? Only hope this is first and the last as well, for God's sake ! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried every thing, to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love songs. Why does Himesh not smile ? Simple, because he does not use close Up toothpaste ! Now there this friend of his, tailing him around every where, and this number one lawyer in the town, who has to herself sexily wiggle and try to seduce Himesh, of all the handsome German people she might have met earlier, perhaps the male lawyers on this part of the world might be cursing their fate, for destined to deal with the stiff, unattractive lot, every day ! The action scenes are so funnily shot, like the event planner attacked by the thief, autos riding over the cars, so on and so forth. The father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her off, that he flies to and fro around. Most hypocrite, he praises HR for distributing love among people of the world, as if they were sweets , and on his back, coolly gives a lecture to his daughter on these show business men. when Himesh is proved innocent, he again unceremoniously dumps the other guy, as if it's a game of musical chair ! i didn't get to se the poor guy's face even, did you ? Hansika in the role of Ria, looks as if she is in need of an eye check up, for strain in her eyes ! The fellow in the role of a friend is good, who has acted quite naturally, and should be in better movies, like Sharman Joshi, for example. Child artist in Trishu's brief appearance is sweet, but wasted. It seems today's young generation has gone nuts , since they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores , and associate gossip with it, for example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost would come. this is a weird taste in music, and rather funny. i am surprised, how such classic lyricists like Gulzar , have opted for Himesh of all the people, to give music. There is story in Panchtantra , that a crow attachés so many feathers of a peacock, to look beautiful, and appeal to the birds; but the feathers fall off ultimately, and the real dark crow is revealed ! Hope Himesh takes a hint, and refrains from manufacturing such meaningless stuff, and wasting precious money, which he has earned by taxing his short nose so much ! His friend does tell him, if your nose is cut, how will you sing ? Thanks for showing us Germany, Himesh, at a reasonable cost of renting the DVD ! and correct those spelling mistakes, will you ? an extra e in movie, and no e in love ! There is also a famous number from the old film Sholey, Mehbooba, on which Mallika Sherawat wiggles, once again, but this time with Himesh, winking at her, and conveniently, Ria , his so-called real love, and his new bride is not around ! Now that was very clever, Himesh ! At least one thing in this movie which you have done smartly, to justify Sherawat's presence . But doesn't she look a bit washed down ?" 
" Must Avoid - Unbearable","First things first, how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this. I saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head, what exactly is director trying to say.If its a thriller, there are no thrills, if its action, there is no action barring a chase sequence, there is no Drama, and the much touted love story, it actually never takes off. No passion, emotion nothing is there.Actually I never expected wonders from the movie, however after the bumper opening it took, I thought of giving it a chance. I have no problems with Himesh Reshamiya whatsoever, and I am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity. I went in with an Open mind and came out with a closed one.Let's not put the blame of Himesh Reshamiya, he is just a Debutant Actor. But direction, screenplay, writing, makeup, everything has gone for a toss.Himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve. He can do the don kind of roles. Hansika is just a kid, and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks.The only actor who was good was the friend of Himesh in the movie, I don't know his name, but he looks promising.Watch it at your own risk, not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing.** Strongly recommend to avoid this Movie.**" 
" Waste of Money","I have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and I must say that i never felt that bad, which I felt after watching this extra large bore movie, it was bad, very Bad. There were songs & songs. Nobody should watch this movie. The director has shown Germans speaking English which is so rubbish. Germans does not speak English. & in one scene there was a white girl who asked Himesh for autograph. (Obv that he must have gave some money to her) In the promo they have shown prepare for Laughing riot. But i could say there was only one scene where that Himesh was laughing for no reason may be he thinks he's funny. Hansika is very good. she is like an angel. But too young only 16 yrs old. If you have plenty of time and don't know what to do then you should watch this movie or else its waste of money" 
" not up-to the mark","one of the most awaited movie!i thought himesh will do a bit of acting but Alas all my hope went wrong..given that the heroine is 15 yrs old!!!!omg!!what did they thought before considering the actress..may be its because no boby wants to work with HR(as he is called in the film,(human resource as many people wrote in mazagines!)nevertheless it was a disappointment.i hope the producer doesn't make himself bankrupt by making a part 2 of this as this news is roaming around...the story was predictable one with himesh showing his generosity character throughout the movie which i doubt very well.anyways..the movie is good from those people's angle who thinks himesh cant do anything wrong. >>4 out of 10<<" 
" I hope you are reading this HR...","( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too. ) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he has done. No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress ). As intense as Reshamiya is I thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. Ironically he is depicted the same but for what care? Sheer incompetence, carelessness, awful acting, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain.Blunders rule. ( Ex. How can German Police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in English? They communicate among themselves in English!) Unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line Bollywood. There are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too. The worse thing is that the majority just doesn't care.Songs are the only saving grace...Please don't repeat this HR and find yourself a good director ( low budget.. No problem).The villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know... after all it's a 50Cr movie." 
" Great musical, decent movie","The film's good to watch if you don't expect too much from it - except the songs are so well composed, sung and filmed. Hansika shows promise, while Himesh lights up for the songs but is just acceptable as an actor. Performances are not that great.Good direction but storyline isn't polished. Locations are well filmed and we have some views of Germany. Well, it's a an average film with great music. I'd watch it again just for the songs!Well, with all the popularity that Himesh has these days, the film will have to work, not mentioning the massive advertising for it. If Aashiq Banaya Aapne stayed in the theaters only on the account of the Himesh music (according to Filmfare), why not this one? Afterall, the reason I'm going to watch this movie again is 1. the songs and 2. Hansika." 
" aap ka darr-burr(gas)","Agreed this movie is well shot,but it just makes no sense and no use as to how they made 2 hours seem like 3 just over a small love story,this could have been an episode of the bold and the beautiful or the o.c,in short please don't watch this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes just to wake you up from you're sleep,i gave this movie 1/10 cause that was the lowest,and no this is not based completely on a true story,more than half of it is made up.I repeat the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10,but the movie is just a little too much,the actor's nasal voice just makes me want to go blow my nose.Unless you are a real him mesh fan this movie is a huge no-no." 
" A Big Grade moviee luvded with gloss and HR","01. Prashant Chadda  directing a full-fledged movie is different ball game altogether, innit? And why was storyline thinner than Pringles? 02. Is the movie funded by Tourism Board of Germany?03. HR should have taken acting classes before kicking off the project04. Curiosity value pretty high - even the greatest detractors would succumb to watch it. Also the marketing department has done a fine job05. Songs are good  and must admit that HR is pretty much original06. Actress is pretty cute - does have potential to go miles07. Mallika Sherawat... okay she is just there. Period. 08. Raj Babbar - what was on your mind when you signed the dotted line?09. Sachin Khedekar  why up & against the marriage from the word go? Lack of characterisation maybe?10. Darshan Jariwala  strictly okay11. Showcases HR in full glory... read that as blowing his own trumpet12. Pretty much predictable storyline 13. Auto rickshaw  my God!!! Fine if you wanted to lick their boots should have based the story in India" 
" dubbing of voices","As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, I was approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio.While I speak German as well, i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience... So therefore, all Germans in this movie actually speak English! funny enough i did multiple characters, so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again, listen carefully; all non-Indian characters are only done by 4 voices! . . . ." 
" Rocking!","I was looking forward to this film since November 2006 when it was first announced and that entire wait was worth it. Himesh Reshammiya is simply my most favourite composer ever! I have always loved his music but he has also proved to be a terrific actor. The ace composer-singer turns actor-hero with Aap Ka Surroor which was a great romantic thriller, shot at great expense abroad. The story of the film was amazing about Himesh as himself who was accused of murder while he was in Germany to perform in a sell-out show and arrested. When he was in prison the story went back about 15 days ago when he first arrived in Germany and fell in love with Riaa an Indian girl. The love story was so heartfelt & peaceful and I'm not saying that I liked the film because I'm a Himesh fan, I still would have liked it if he wasn't in it. Himesh's best get-up was in the song Assalaam Vaalekum with his black over coat and red cap. I don't know which the best song is because every song is better than the other and the soundtrack of this film is the best soundtrack of 2007 without a doubt! Overall it is an absolute beautiful movie which is a must see for all Himesh fans." 
" Aap Kaa Surroor: The Movie - The Real Yawn","Aap Kaa Surroor is really bad.The story is stupid.The screenplay is penned very badly.God alone knows how this was a hit.Even a B-grade movie hero could act much better than Himesh.The music is third-grade.Hansika Motwani,is terrible.The only and only reason why this movie deserves one star is because of Mallika Sherawat,she looks bewitching and acts better than the lead actor and actress.Better if the Performances are not talked about,because all end up being dull except Mallika Sherawat.On the whole Aap Kaa Surroor is a big yawn." 
" Wonderful film","Predictable- probably, but worth it? - YES!! I am a huge Himesh Fan, but you don't need to be to appreciate the sincerity and genuineness the Singer turned actor brings to his performance. Besides, there is no harm, is there? If you appreciate a man who actually honors his word and values respect, then you will appreciate what this film has to offer. Himesh is so believable and so sincere, it fortifies all the reasons why one should appreciate his freshman debut in this film. Yes, it is a true love story and the settings are beautiful. The songs alone capture you, but so does the performance of this humble artist. Great story, great music, great scenery- what more do you really need? Run, and I mean run, to see this great love story." 
" Please don't watch it.!!!","This movie has to be the worst film of 2007, it was just really bad and i don't think i have ever seen a film that is just so bad, i mean the don't make really bad Hollywood films do they?? Hamish really should stick to singing instead of acting cause he just can't act at all, god he was just so bad, i mean he was that bad in the film that he made Mallika Sherawat look like a better actress than him, as for her performance, she plays the same role in every movie, god it is just so boring watching her, i mean what do men see in this woman?, yeah she has a god body but where is that talent???? i have not seen it yet and at this rate i don't think that i ever will.Anyway Hamish falls in love with Ria now this 15 year old girl can act, my god she was the best actor in the film and she does not look 15 at all, to me she looks about 21, but her performance was brilliant in the film. bless her she was really good, i hope to see more of her in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himash, but her father wants her to marry someone else, a typical bollywood film anyways there is a hiccup (can only happen in a bollywood film) and the both get married in the end.Well i would give th music 10/10 it was superb, that made the movie a hit, the songs were truly amazing and brilliant. anyways the only thing that i can say is to go and buy the music and not watch the film."
