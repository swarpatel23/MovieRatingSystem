" Crap","Arjun Deva Directed By Imran Khalid is A Revenge Drama. Script is Weak & Screenplay is Similar To 70's Movies. Nothing New Same Old Revenge Story.Mithun as Arjun is Now A Gunman Whose Sister Was Raped & Murdered By Chaudhary Brothers including Shakti Kapoor. Now To Tackle With Arjun Shakti Kapoor Hires Devaa. How They Fight Each Other And How It Ends. Few Subplots Like Love & Comedy Are Added Because Story Is Not That Engaging. Mithun is As Usual Good With His Dialogues. Puru Rajkumar As Deva is Weak(He Was Poor Actor) & Hopeless. Shakti Kapoor Does Nothing New & Unknown Actress Rutika Singh is Good.Music is Crap. Not A Single Good Song. Avoid The Movie & Do Something Fruitful."
