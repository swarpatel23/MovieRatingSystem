" True love has no obstacles.","True love has no obstacles that cannot be overcome.  "Yeh Mohabbat Hai" has all the elements that make a film great. Johnny Lever is as usual a top comic. Rahul(Chand) and Mohini(Shaheen) are very raw and very real in their performance. This movie deserves a 10. It has a hit number named after the title, and truly is just marvelous stuff in every way."
