" Finally, a hero who uses his brains!","Although though the story is not new, the movie's approach to it definitely is.  Basically, when "those" scenes arrive where you can guarantee what is going to be the outcome, usually the opposite happens.  I liked Bobby Deol's character.  He was more realistic and less irritating than your typical bloodthirsty protagonist out to seek vengance for the guy who killed his brother, mother, sister, etc.  You know those moments when you're like talking to the characters and saying stuff like "Why did you do that?  You should have done..."  Well, in this movie, Bobby actually uses his brains! Wow!  Hooray!  He simply is seeking for justice and doesn't waste his and our time fighting every "gunda" that gets in his way.  Lara Dutta's character is also nice.  She plays an honest and intelligent lawyer and Bobby's ex-girlfriend.  The entire cast, who hasn't appeared in a movie for a quite a while until this movie released, brings a fresh feel to the film, especially Rahul Dev.  Songs are good." 
" Watchable","Mostly Bobby Deol signed crap films except some This is one of his better filmsit has a done to death story agreed, but the film is handled very well by E.Niwas though they are some snagsThe film starts off well and comes to the point quickly and the entire scenes of Bobby searching for Ritiesh till the morgue scene are fantasticThe film does follow the beaten part but thankfully our hero is mostly realistic in his use of media.etc and doesn't go the sunny way till the Pre-climaxThe climax does a about turn and looks stupid even the characterization of Ritiesh looks too confusing, like he is shown like a bad guy first and then completely honestE-Niwas after the riveting SHOOL and okay LOVE KE LIYE KUCH BHI KAREGA gives a decent film Music is okay, luckily only 2-3songs and they don't distractBobby Deol excels in his part, his suppressed anger is well handled Earlier Bobby looked too uncomfortable in emotions but he has grown a lot and is awesome in his role though he reminds of Sunny in portions Lara is good, better then in many of her films Ritiesh is good in his small part Tara is less annoying as she was in MASTI Rahul Dev is okay Virendra Saxena is great" 
" From the director who brought you Dum, comes Bardaasht!","and you can just imagine that it deals with a dirty cop once more. Bardaasht we are told in the film means 'Tolerate' or 'Tolerance' in English and for the most part the film is highly tolerable. Bobby Deol plays Aditya Shrivastav a man seeking justice and ultimate revenge following the wrongful death of his younger brother Anuj Shrivastav (played by Ritesh Deshmukh). On the day of Anuj's demise, he had a run in with his brother concerning his recent behaviour at school as well as at a nightclub where he nearly lost his life when he suffered a massive asthma attack while boozing and partying. During this argument, Anuj reopens past wounds that enables the viewers to see into his brother Aditya's past. We come to learn that Aditya is a disrobed -- for insubordination-- soldier, who also lost the woman (Payal, played by the ever alluring Lara Dutta) he loved in the process and who now lives his life for the benefit of his younger brother.When Anuj fails to return home that night, Aditya goes to the nearest precinct to report him missing the next day and is given the run around by the police when he gets there. He is finally given the time of day by ACP Yeshwant Thakur (played by Rahul Dev in yet another negative role, please anyone who has seen this man in a good role please send me a pm telling which film it's in) who allows the case to be registered and then processed. Later than evening, Aditya's cousin Dinanath Shrivastav (played Anjaan Srivastav) receives a lead and alerts Aditya to meet him at a morgue where they discover Anuj's body. The police report that accompanies it, states that the boy was shot dead by police when they discovered him running a drug ring. Aditya refuses to believe this, and refuses to immerse his brother's ashes until he gets to the bottom of the apparent cover-up of the real crime. Veerendra Saxena co-stars as good cop with a guilty conscience Mehmood Bhai, and Tara Sharma is riveting as Ramona, Anuj's girlfriend. A must see for all!"
