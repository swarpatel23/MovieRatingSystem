" Horrible beyond belief!","The plot was loosely based on a true story. Sonia, a wealthy and educated entrepreneur, travels to India to find a husband. There she meets and weds uneducated Sahil, taking him back with her to London. He is forced by her into prostitution to maintain their lifestyle, she blackmails him into continuing with threats of revealing his behavior to his folks back home. Sahil is not allowed to keep money, and his passport has been destroyed. He meets a stripper, Negar, with whom he falls in love. She tells him that they can escape his evil wife.If you value your time at all, do not waste 104 minutes watching this drivel. Soft porn at it's sleaziest. Sahil Khan, best known for college comedies like "Style" and "Xcuse Me" models his way through this movie, first a pose, then a pose without a shirt, then a pose putting a shirt on. Then, ride left and right all over town on a motorcycle.Negar Khan's performance lacks anything resembling acting. She pouts unnaturally enlarged lips and mumbles her lines. There is absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters in this film.Ayesha Jhulka, a veteran performer, hands the most convincing performance as the evil Sonia, despite having to work with an awful, choppy script.Songs weren't that good, most done for the shock factor of exposing skin or raunchy "sex scenes" (well - not sex scenes by US standards but Bollywood standards).I gave this movie a one, simply because they do not offer the option to give negative numbers! Don't even think about watching this one!"
