" Not only entertaining....but enlightening also!","I personally really liked the movie.True, it may not have been as fast-paced or powerful as the first one, but it definitely leaves an impact, and a big one too. I not only enjoyed every minute of this movie, but learned a lot from it too.The background music was good, it suited the scenes and the genre and the religious temperament of Subhash Nagre, who after all IS the protagonist. Everything eventually, does revolve around him. Dialogues were amazing. So what if they were philosophical and unrealistic at times? They were meaningful and thought-provoking. I have to admit, even after the movie and during dinner with my family, I was pondering over some of Subhash Nagre's words. I especially loved the dialog "There is very thin line between profuse loyalty and betrayal." Honestly, it made a lot of sense and got me thinking about something I had never realised. Whoever wrote the dialogs deserves special praise! I think they were one of the film's strongest aspects.Of course, in order to give justice to notable dialogs, you need apt actors who can deliver them perfectly. And thank goodness, the dialogs don't go to waste! Big B, Abs and Aish were all top-notch in this movie. They proved themselves, once again, to be one of the finest actors in the film industry. They also proved their versatility because their roles were definitely not easy and very different to other roles they had taken on in the past. Everything about them was perfect...no criticisms or complaints! The story and plot were interesting and although the pace may have slackened at various points, I would not regard it as one of the film's (if there are any), minus points. I think the slow scenes were a much needed contrast to the fast and violent scenes that the film comprised of otherwise. They made the audience realise that the characters in the film, no matter how heroic or powerful they may be, are humans, with emotions and moments where they simply need to be with each other and express themselves. It added a realistic and human touch to the film. The twists and the climaxes were extremely well executed and definitely had the intended effect on the viewer. All the characters and situations in the film contributed to the happening of the twists and climax brilliantly. Nothing made me question - but how can that happen...or why did that happen? I was satisfied and convinced throughout.Overall, Sarkar Raj was a remarkable piece of cinema that will have a deep impact on the audience, and although you may not want to watch it again, it will take longer than you think to escape your mind" 
" Brilliant sequel!!","I've just got back from watching the movie and I must say I was thrilled with the way the director, Ram Gopal Verma has laid out the film in pure brilliance.I wasn't expecting much as sequels never do great. I thought the first installment was excellent but this sequel really out-did the first movie.The three Bachchan's really put in outstanding performances. I must applaud Amitabh Bachchan for just being so natural in the movie, and have never seen a better performance by him in this kind of a role.So you guys, if you've seen the first film and liked the plot then, I'm sure you'll love the second one. And for you guys who have not watched the first movie (Sarkar) and are planning to just get to this one (Sarkar Raj), get through the first one first, then hit the screens for this one as the film runs in a flow!! My rating ; 8.5/10 Seriously, it was that good!!" 
" A classic treat to watch.","This movie brings RGV back on track after quite a few miserable movies. This is a sequel to a 2005 hit Sarkar and it fulfills all the requirement of a great sequel.Besides its strong content, SARKAR RAJ has been filmed exceptionally well too. In fact, SARKAR RAJ has the trademark RGV stamp in every sequence. The review would be incomplete without giving the due credit to writer Prashant Pandey's incredible and almost flawless script. Amar Mohile's background score is topnotch. The by-now-famous 'Govinda' chant in the background only enhances the impact. Amit Roy's cinematography is exceptional. The DoP succeeds in giving the film the raw-n-rustic look, which works very well. Action Allan Amin, in minimal doses, is perfect. SARKAR RAJ is embellished with superb performances! Amitabh Bachchan, expectedly, comes up with a terrific performance. He's as ferocious as a wounded tiger in the finale and takes the film to great heights.First YUVA, then GURU, now SARKAR RAJ. Abhishek Bachchan is cast opposite the finest actor of this country, yet he sparkles in every sequence. This time, the father and son go neck to neck as far as acting honors go. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is fabulous and delivers her career-best performance in SARKAR RAJ. Enough has been written about her looks, but not much space has been devoted to her performances. HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM, DEVDAS, PROVOKED, GURU, JODHAA AKBAR and now SARKAR RAJ - she's only got better with every film.Every supporting actor in SARKAR RAJ stands out - Dilip Prabhawalkar was superb, Govind Namdev was first-rate, Sayaji Shinde was perfect, Ravi Kale and Supriya Pathak were OK.Tanisha is alright. The actor enacting the role of Dilip Prabhawalkar's grandson makes a strong impact." 
" A Good Sequel/","To be honest after Ram Gopal Verma's "Aag," I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie even though it had the top actors and also because, normally, I am not very fond of sequels as I believe that they ruin the original.An overseas based company wants to build a power plant in Maharashtra but the owners, Mike Rajsn and his daughter, Anita Rajan face a lot of opposition and the only man who can help them is Subash Nagre and his son, Shankar. Shankar and his father believe that the plant should be built in Maharashtra and persuade people of the villages where the plant is to be built to accept the plans. But events turn ugly, when one day Avantika, Subash's daughter  in  law is killed when her car is detonated by a bomb.The movie stars Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Supriya Pathak, Victor Bannerjee and Tanisha.Not as good as the original, Ram Gopal Verma, still has managed to put in some ghosts of Mario Puzo's "The Godfather" more so with reference to bombing of the vehicle and to some extent, he has put in some ghosts of "Sarkar" as well. What was a bit disappointing was that sound track, "Govinda" has not lived to the expectations as it did in the previous one and this is where, perhaps, the music director, Amar Mohile, could have done more to revive the original version.Be warned there is violence but never the less a good movie to watch with elder children and adult family members." 
" Good movie as good story","I am not a fan of RGV's films but this movie is a great make. amazing suspense,correct hold on the direction. as the name suggest( rule of Almighty), it rocks as how mastermind thinks. Good thing about the movie is that it leaves a good message to be true,straight and to think about good of community. movie has low pace but all the characters are strong enough to hold you. some time movie goes in predictable manner and you can guess what would be the next dialog. but after all the movie is good(full of violence,without showing much blood). dialog delivery is superb,and ya .... i didn't see Ash's goggles worth 50 Lacs in the movie :(. i liked the movie for it's best direction, thrilling story, good delivery and best length." 
" Good Sequel, awaiting a better one","Sarkar was a brilliant tribute from RGV to the Godfather. So is its sequel Sarkar Raj. It's just the presence of both the real life Father Son duo's awesome screen presence that makes it very much watch worthy. And yes Ash Rai Bachan comes out with a note worthy performance.The villains pitted against the Sarkar need to be more realistic and challenging. They seem strong, brainy but simply perish to the Sarkar. The plot isn't great but you'll be assured of surprises. The cinematography is simply revolutionary. The mood and tone of this film is simply visible in every shot incidentally a little overdone.The father-son contrasting style of ideals comes into forte. The Older Sarkar(Big B) is on post retirement and the new one(Bachan Jr.) handles it all with expertise. Enters Ash with a project beneficial to Maharashtra and what follows is the plot.I am eagerly awaiting another better written RGV Sarkar sequel." 
" A Nutshell Review: Sarkar Raj",""To kill is a crime, but to kill at the right time is politics."Sarkar Raj is the sequel to the 2005 movie Sarkar by Ram Gopal Varma, which is said to be the Indian equivalent of The Godfather starring megastar Amitabh Bachchan in the titular role where a gangster gets elected to political power. You don't really need to watch Sarkar in order to enjoy Sarkar Raj, as characters get introduced fairly quickly, and their motivations spelt out clearly on the surface. Necessary links to the original were presented in flashbacks, while the story here takes off with new challenges that present themselves to the characters whom you can get chummy with in a jiffy.There were a few things I was amazed with regarding the movie. For starters, to a relative Bollywood newbie like myself, this movie will debunk all notions that Indian movies have to come default with song and dance. There is absolutely no forced musical sequences in the movie, perhaps only the the Govindar theme song which gets repeated play. Next, the richness of colours I am used to when watching movies from the Indian continent gets replaced by a very strained palette, with quite a gritty look that aligns itself with its subject matter. And the shaky camera technique invades the industry too, though there was adequate contrast provided in its camera styles to reflect the innate characteristics of the leads - for a seasoned gangster who has mellowed and found calm, the camera is measured and still to reflect the old ginger's state of mind, whereas when following his heir apparent, it's shaky-cam for the most parts to accentuate his cock-sure impatient nature beneath a facade of confidence.Going by the loud chuckles of a predominantly Indian audience I was with, there were certainly some nuances that went unappreciated by myself because my lack of knowledge was likely to have not allowed me into some of those jokes, though there were times I could identify with the story's slight mocking of the state of Indian politics, and with the lack of clear direction amongst the chief villains as well, which played for stifled laughs.Sarkar Raj opens with Aishwarya Rai's Anita Rajan, the daughter of an industrialist in England who wishes to build a power plant in Subhash Nagare's (Amitabh Bachchan) controlled state. Celebrating his birthday, Subhash takes opportunity to signal that his son Shankar Nagare (played by real life son Abhishek Bachchan) has arrived on the big political arena, and is likely to take a more active role in decision making. This shows when he quietly backs and puts faith in his son's pursuit in having the power plant located in their territory, despite having to displace 40,000 people in the short term. Like all politicians with good intent, they're looking toward the long term goals of providing basic electrical infrastructure to their people, but as with all things, there are bound to be opposition to decisions by the incumbent.And that's just the tip of the iceberg, as in slightly more than 2 hours, we're bombarded with political battles made with strategic moves akin to a game of chess, only that the players involved are more than two across a wooden board. There are outright opponents in your face, but the deadlier ones are always those who remain in the shadows, and are difficult to pin down. Gentlemanly campaigning does not suffice, as tricks from the illegitimate book of tactics get drawn out, to consequences that will spiral everyone down the road of violence begetting more violence.While Amitabh clearly is the head of the household here, just when you thought he had taken a backseat in his role in the sequel, he jumps right back into the driving seat with a vengeance, and it's always interesting to witness the charismatic actor in action. Son Abhishek holds his own against his father's imposing figure, and the both of them as on- screen father-son brings about a sense of realism and naturalness to their characters' relationship, as the son whom the father can trust, and as the father whom the son could rely on for support. Rounding up the Bollywood royalty here is the first post marriage pairing of Abhishek and wife Aishwarya Rai, though Rai's character happens to be somewhat sidelined to a few appearances with plenty of tear duct activation, and doesn't really forward the plot much. But should there be another sequel, then Rai's character is already primed for a meatier role then.Sarkar Raj has enough story elements to keep you engaged throughout as the characters make all attempts to outplay, outwit and outlast one another. Basic greed of man and being unappreciated (then growing feet too big for their shoes) usually are reasons enough for one to turn against another, but the reminder that goes out is to never rub another man's rhubarb, especially when it belongs to someone with political clout, powerful base support, and well, is a top gangster with no qualms of exacting punishment without remorse.It makes me want to hunt down the DVD for the first installment already, to see how the Nagares got to consolidate their power, and how certain outcomes mentioned here were played out earlier. Definitely a recommended crime and political thriller!" 
" A Must Watch","The Cast consists of all the Bachchans (except for Jaya Bacchan whom RGV couldn't fit in with an appropriate mafia role) After the agony and widespread damage caused by Ram Gopal Varrma's AAG, people wanted to see whether RGV and the Big B can resurrect themselves. Plus this movie was a sequel to 2005's Sarkar which was RGV's tribute to 'The Godfather'To make sequels in Bollywood has always been a very tricky issue as the comparisons are too critical in nature with the first part.Lage Raho Munnabhai was probably the first Big Hindi movie which became a major success when compared to its prequel...If any of you guys thought that Sarkar Raj was based on another one of the Godfather series, well then you are grossly mistaken! Writers Prashant Pandey and Ram Gopal Varma have come up with a fresh,new and brilliant plot to assure the audience of 125 entertaining minutes....I don't believe in blogging movie spoilers, so i'll be as vague as possible....cause this movie is a must see!!The movie mainly revolves around three characters ( The Bachchan Arena) Subash Nagre (Big B), Shankar Nagre (Abishek) and Anita Rajan (Aishwarya Rai)...Subash has full faith in his son Shankar though he finds it difficult to deal with the fact that its Shankar who is the actual 'Sarkar'...Shankar wants what is best for Maharashtra and Anita Rajan steps in from London as a CEO of Sheperd group...her aim is to make India's largest power plant. Anita realizes Maharashtra as a potential site.Even though Subhas is against the proposition, Shankar strongly believes it is for the state's betterment and he decides to support Anita and her project no matter what stands in their way...When so many crores of rupees are at stake, the plant project becomes a battleground for dirty politics, deceit and corruption.I do not wish to disclose any more facts of the movie !!u should see it.....The villains are convincing and the supporting cast has small roles with clearly defined characters....The 3 Bachchans have given subtle yet strong performances and it is difficult to see who is the real Sarkar amongst them....The Dialogues of the movie are powerful and crisp and act as the real Forte of the movie...The background score is impressive though the 'Govinda Govinda' chantings do tend to get annoyingly over used!!RGV gets full marks for his direction...the editing is perfect as well.....even though there are no song and dance sequences the movie doesn't bore you one bit...The movie is self explanatory and one need not have seen Sarkar to follow Sarkar Raj...thats another plus point...The action scenes are spectacular and more importantly 'Very Realistic'!!! RGV clearly demonstrates that the Bullet penetrates both- the Hero and the Villain.The first half is kinda slow but RGV constructs a proper platform to carry the movie further with ease...the second half is totally gripping and moves at a fairly quick pace...No matter what happens don't miss the 2nd half...especially the part where the suspense of the entire plot will be revealed by Subhas Nagre....thats an amazing scene that will take all by surprise!!Overall, a brilliant movie which i totally enjoyed !!!VERDICT: Sarkar Raj - will extinguish the agony caused by RGV's AAG!!! A must see!!!FOR MORE REVIEWS ON MOVIES AND MUSIC ALBUMS PLEASE VISIT MY BLOG http://themusicandmoviezone.blogspot.com/"

" Power really needs to be taken !","The power game continues. The first part 'Sarkar' may have been inspired from the movie 'Godfather', but the second part is much more impressive than 'Godfather 2'. It theoretically depicts the mind games that take place when power needs to be taken in hands. This movie combines the 2 most powerful aspects that attract movie goers to theaters....first being power and second being suspense. ...People who say that the story of Sarkar Raj isn't strong enough have not understood the first part either. It is all Politics. Lives are taken in the name of power , not in the name of money. Money is just the goal , not the path. The movie portrays an aging politician (for say) and his anxiety with his son to take over power from him . There are a few characters who have single handedly caught the audience by their breath....kudos to Rajesh Shringarpore , who plays the role of Somji....where has this actor been all this while ? ....A beautiful sketch of an opposing politician and the fire in his blood to take over the reigns of Maharashtra. Dilip Prabhavalkar shows his soft style but impacting acting as he does in every film. The Sepia touch to the movie really keeps you intact in your seat and your eyes searching for answers. The Background score is more powerful than the first part and rightly so . There are a few flaws in the movie too , may be the Aag effect hasn't totally worn off Ram Gopal Verma. The most obvious flaw of over portraying a character is the serial murderer who wears a rubber glove , and that too it has been shown that he disguises himself as a reporter in the press conference but still wears the glove and holds the pen....Somji's habit of drinking water (The director hasn't shown him ever going to the Toilet).Despite being a billionaire NRI Aishwarya Rai doesn't show a slight Accent....(Come On !) to earn those billions of dollars one might have stayed at least 5 years , and eventually developed that accent. To top it off she speaks more fluent Hindi than Kantilal 'V'ohra." 
" A weak film to follow Sarkar","Sarkar Raj is disappointing. More so because it is the sequel of Sarkar, which though copied largely from Godfather, was a good film.Three things let down the film - slow pace, unimaginative cinematography and jarring background score.Ram Gopal Varma has a story in his hands but it is not long enough to stretch to the duration that he wants it to. As a result, he compromises on the pace. The film is slow and at times just drags on. In this endeavor, the camera comes to his support. Each shot just keeps on moving at snails pace. The camera lingers and moves slowly at acute angles. There is an overkill of the use of lighting, shadows and silhouettes. Add to this the background score which seems to be taken from a temple fair. The energy of the music and the dead slow pace of camera and story are divergent contrasts.The dialogs are unrealistic, philosophical and indirect most of the times. There was not need to complicate the film with such devices. Do a father and son never talk in straight language? Saving grace of the film is the performances. Inspite of the lighting and camera angles which try every bit to take away the quality from the natural performances of the Bachchans, they manage to survive.Ram Gopal Varma needs a break. He probably needs to go on a long vacation and then come back to do something completely out of his style - cast Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in a romantic comedy set in Europe or Manhattan. I hope, he will then rediscover his lost touch. I so much want him to, like many of his other fans." 
" Godfather revisited","RGV has redeemed it's lost pride. He has been upfront with his portrayal of the timeless classic Godfather. The original Sarkar started off with the credit line which went something like "An entire generation of filmmakers have been inspired by Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather, so am I". So let's analyze this: The movie is an example of first rate film-making and it resumes where the prequel left off. The characters are very well etched out (except a couple). The first half is very well-done and in more ways than one better than the second - it's intense and engaging. The back-ground score of "Govinda, Govinda" becomes annoying and the movie can certainly do without it. The similarity with the Godfather series is amazing. Acting is first rate and superb.Big B - is perfect and not to mention is India's answer to Marlon Brando. He emotes such effortlessly and no wonder is an institution by himself. Jr. B - Abhishek tries his level best to portray Al Pacino as Michael Corleone - and only succeeds partially. Watch out for his intensity, and his no-nonsense approach which is borrowed from Al Pacino's character in the Godfather. He is shown to be a man of few words in the movie, which works well.Some scenes between the father and the son (when the father is shown regretting his elder son Vishnu(Kay Kay Menon's death) are my personal favorites, again borrowed from the screen between Al Pacino and the ailing Marlon Brando. In my opinion this is one of the scenes - where the movie soars above the average.Rao Saheb - is Hymen Roth from the original classic. Very well thought of and provides for a good twist at the end. Govind Namdeo is brilliant as Hassan Qazi, Shayaji Shinde is wasted, so is Victor Banerjee - even though he does perfect justice to the character of the NRI Industrialist - a character made his own. Not much to watch out from Aishwarya - routine performance, but she does look her part, and carries it quite nonchalantly.The ending will shock you - at least I did not expect it, and I would have personally liked a different ending but I RGV had other thoughts. However he has left no doubt whatsoever that there will be Sarkar Part 3 - the last scene spells it out without much subtlety.The one person who one would have liked to see in the sequel is Kay-Kay Menon (Vishnu). The intensity that he brings to the table as an actor is truly amazing. Overall an engrossing film - leaves you craving for an extra couple of reels at the end as it seems a little rushed towards the finishing.Nonetheless everyone Take-a-Bow,Indian film-making has finally arrived !" 
" Ram Gopal Varma's Redemption","With Sarkar Raj Ram Gopal Varma has redeemed himself. The camera work is fantastic. Cinematographer's use of light and specially sunlight is fabulous. At times you actually visualize that chess pieces are moving on a chess board of Politics The story begins with plans of building a huge power plant in Maharashtra which will displace around 40,000 people. Subhash Nagre (Amithabh) initially opposes the project because earning the err of people in the area, but his son Shankar (Abhishek) convinces him to take tough decisions for the betterment of the public in the long term.With this the duo and Anita (Aishwarya) the CEO of the project move to the interiors of Maharashtra to explain the benefits of the project to the general Public. For this they also rope in Subhash Nagre's old teacher in Politics Rao Saheb (Dilip Prabhavalkar) But just as things start moving up Rao Saheb's Grandson Sanjay Somji (Rajesh Shringarpore)opposes the project as it would only benefit Bombay at the price of local farmers. Seeing the opposition in Maharashtra Kantilal Vora (Upendra Limaye) wants to shift the project to Gujarat, much to the dismay of Shankar.A stage is set for a power struggle between the have's and the have not's. Will Shankar be able to keep the power project in Maharashtra, will he be able to keep his credibility with masses or will he have to back down.Is this about power project or just petty politics or something much bigger, nothing seems to be as it appears." 
" Appreciation: a must watch film","my sincere appreciation to RGV............before i start of my review my expectations are high towards the third part that RGV is expected to take in the near future......the films background has been worked well as i can see the technological intervention in sound works more than the first part..Big B was good as usual...Abhishek Bachan is shaping out well to be a great actor as he proved his point in this film... i am southindian i don't understand Hindi at all... as i had to follow the subtitle..the dialogue are mind blowing...I have two doubts in this film, one.. why was ishwarya rai carried throughout the way in the movie..she was more like a shadow to shankar nagre usually the nagre group don't entertain family members or others into what they do....... doubt two.. as Big B says at the start of the film that his son is also on the field for nearly 3 years now he would have clearly figured out something was odd as the bomb was set on the car....i think he would found that was a costly hit and he would have at least had a spark that something fishy was going on around him above the power plant ... other than that the film is an another feather to RGV's hat or flock of movies he had directed last request if RGV did reads this comment i would encourage him to do the continuation on this project as the third part rather than doing another project.......... i have added RGV to list of favourite director Cum producer after Mani Ratnam, Selva Ragavan , Gautham Menon" 
" A Perfect Blend of Everything","This movie has it all - unexpected incidents, a not-so-great but can't-be-better soundtrack, up-to-the-mark acting, and an absorbing storyline. Let's face it - we all hate politics. At least the majority. And here we have a whole film based on the same and not a second makes you feel that it is being dragged forward unnecessarily! Seeing it that way - imagine yourself - it must have SOMETHING that makes me praise it so much?Maybe Aishwarya was the only disappointing factor of the film... the cinematography, editing, choreography and whatever other -ings or -graphies are there were close to perfect.A worthy 9/10.And yes, the ending DOES promote a sequel for those who think it doesn't." 
" Not what i thought, its a SUSPENSE movie","The new Sarkar Raj sure has RGV's touch to it, Before watching i thought this would be a big disappointment for all 'Sarkar' fans but i was wrong. The movie does not dazzles you but keeps you sit tight throughout, except for the some portions where it gets real slow. you could go out and get popcorns once again :) Performance wise, RGV has dug a lot and got some nice actors for extra roles. some of them are small time soap opera actors but they did well. "Abhishek" and "Amithab" do their best. "Aishwarya" looks smart in formals. Some scenes in the movie are really breathtaking though. Well, the movie is actually full of suspenses thats why i cant say much since i did not mark 'Contains Spoiler' tag. after i finish this review i have to add 'Suspense' in genre of movie. great camera work and background scores are really catchy. the dialogs are supposed to be "legendary phrases", but some of them does not make that sense. In all i thought the movie was gonna blew up like 'RGV's Sholay' but its not that bad. i would go for it.7 stars from me nirzar"
