" Another gr8 masterpiece from mohit suri!!!!!","Awarapan comes from the stables of ace movie mavericks, Mukesh Bhatt and Mahesh Bhatt, famous for crafting Bollywood's biggest musical hits, Zeher, Woh Lamhe and Gangster.Shot in Hong Kong, Bangkok and Pakistan, Awarapan is an intense and compelling drama about love, passion and betrayal with a chart-busting soundtrack that features for the first time an array of top-notch music artistes from Pakistan.Awarapan tracks the journey of Shivam (Emraan Hashmi), a godless heartbroken boy who has never known or felt love. In order to escape the ghosts of his tragic past, Shivam dedicates himself to serve his gangster boss in Hong Kong with unflinching correctness and loyalty. His boss trusts him enough to ask him to keep an eye on his alluring girlfriend, Reema (Mrinalini Sharma) whom he has kept away from the eyes of his adversaries.Shivam's heart melts on seeing her innocence and vulnerability, as he is able to draw parallels with his girlfriend from the past (Shreya Saran). The atheist turns into a believer and begins smiling and responding to life. Reema gives Shivam reason to believe that she likes him. Existence begins to blush for Shivam but only till the reality dawns on him that Reema has a secret lover tucked away and was planning to elope with him. Her game was merely a smoke- screen created to gain freedom.A shattered Shivam is in a dilemma on realizing that he has been heartlessly used - does he inform his boss or does he earn his wrath by helping his unrequited love to achieve the freedom she yearns for? If anything, 'Awarapan' showcases the acting talent of Emraan Hashmi. The actor steps out of his usual chocolate boy image and plays a very serious and intense role with full conviction. He may not be the deadliest looker around, but he sure does know the art of restraining and underplaying his characters. And his performance in 'Awarapan' proves that he is one of the under-rated talents in Bollywood.Mrinalini Sharma overacts in certain scenes, but manages to play her part fairly well on the whole. Shriya Saran's acting looks very natural. She looks very comfortable playing the brief role she has in the film. Ashutosh Rana is another actor who delivers a superb performance.Mohit Suri succeeds to a great extent in translating an interesting story on celluloid. There are many scenes and sequences (like confrontation between Emraan and Aaliya's father, or Emraan's final sequence with Ashutosh Rana) that are intelligently conceived. The cinematography is visually appealing and the music (by Pritam) is also good.On the whole, 'Awarapan' is worth watching once." 
" excellent movie with excellent acting","Well guys..this is one good movie you are not suppose to miss.a movie which really has a soul in it.the movie begins with a girl(Reema played by Mrinalini Sharma) being kidnapped and is trapped in life where she is a slave to Mittal(played by Ashutosh Rana..who is brilliant),she is in love with someone else but now has to lead a life of a slave to Mittal.Mittal asks Shivam(Emraan Hashmi)to keep an eye on Reema as he doubts whether she is carrying on with some one else.Shivam also has a past where he was in love with Aaliya(Shreya Saran)but was unfortunate to have her love for his entire life.when he meets Reema he remembers Aaliya's words of freedom.Shivam who works for Mittal is being told to kill Reema when he comes to know that she loves someone else.But will Shivam really kill her or will give her freedom?if he has to give her freedom of love then he has to face many consequences.for further story watch the ride of life...Awarapan.and yeah..u will be surprised with Emraan Hashmi's acting as he proves that he can be brilliant too..so enjoy" 
" A must-watch film","I have watched the Film.According to me this one of Emraan's best.The Bhatts never run out of stories.To me Murder was disappointing ,Zeher,Kalyug and Gangster were nice and but this is awesome.Frankly speaking I would say this is Emraan's best acting till date as Shivam.Shriya Saran does not have a big role but gives us a delightful performance as Aaliya. Hong Kong seemed to be the right spot for shooting.Ashutosh Rana(Malik) executes himself brilliantly. Both Mohit(director) and Emraan have kept on improving since their debut.The action,thrill,Shivam's agony, regret and revenge is the USP of the film. The music has been extraordinary with songs like Toh Phir Aao and Tera Mera Rishta which add sparks to the film.But at the end of the day the film belongs to none other than Emraan Hashmi.He shows all the signs of a proficient actor.The film never dips and their a great enthusiasm throughout.Undoubtedly it is one of the biggest hits of the year.Hats off to the whole team of Awarapan." 
" Amazing! Beyond expectations!","Watched the first day first show of it. I went to watch this movie because of Mohit Suri who I think is emerging as one of the very fine directors. Loved his Kalyug and woh lamhe and zehar were also fine. Also the slick promos and haunting music made me go to see it. Really loved it. due credit should be given to Mohit Suri for presenting such a fine heart-touching story. Loved everything from music, performances, cinematography, sound and overall presentation. Music is I believe the finest work of PRITAM yet. This soundtrack shows his extreme potential. Biggest Surprise package in the movie is Emraan Hashmi who was never known for his acting histrionics but awarapan should change that. He portrays the intensity of the depth of the character with utmost ease but credit for this should also be given to Mohit Suri. Even the rest of the cast is has done very well. Technically the film is of international standards. All in all a must see!" 
" Awarapan = A high class gangster movie","This is an excellent movie. It excels in all aspects of a movie. The direction is stylish and engaging, the acting (especially by Emraan Hashmi as the main lead) is superb, the music is excellent, and the story is realistic dealing with real life issues we have today from a gangsters point of view. Its cinematography was one of the best I've seen. It's very beautiful throughout the movie. Especially during Shivam's introduction and during the songs Toh Phir Aao and Tera Mera Rishta.In terms of acting, Emraan was very intense and deeply embedded in his character. He played a depressed character with a dark past. He fulfills his boss's orders, but is also fearless and full of guts when provoked. He was truly Shivam in Awarapan. This has been Emraans finest acting till date. Shivam's role was meant for him. Ashutosh was amazing as his boss. His looks and attitude fit his role perfectly. The supporting cast, particularly Mrinalini Sharma, Shaad Randhawa, Purab Kohli and Shriya Saran fit their roles perfectly.Music wise, the background score by Raju Singh was brilliant. It was soothing and touches your soul. The songs by Pritam and Roxen were great, particularly Mahiya, Toh Phir Aao and Tera Mera Rishta. Awarapan is a movie that reaches out to you and resides in you. If you love gangster movies (or realistic action flicks) then this one is highly recommended for you. Nevertheless, anyone who enjoys watching good movies should watch Awarapan.All in all Awarapan is a top class gangster movie. Highly recommended." 
" Worth to Watch","I went to Watch the movie today. I use to hate Emraan Hashmi a lot because of his unprofessional attitude towards acting but after watching this movie I have changed my mind. The movie is excellent and Emraan Hashmi did very well. He acted maturely and professionally. He did the getup well according to character and also acted well according to it. Within this week I watched 3 movies in cinema and this was the best. The title song was very well fitted. Everyone did fantastic in movie specially Emraan Hashmi.Over all the movie is great and I love that Indian movie is shown in Pakistan. Please do watch this movie." 
" A movie worth watching of Imraan Hashmi","Set so different from other bollywood movies it was so shocking initially to accept that The Serial Kisser a.k.a Imraan Hashmi could ever have done such an act.Overall the movie was superb Where Shivam(Imraan) is living a reckless life blaming himself for the death of his love and losing her has made him so lonely, the title fits in the lead role where in the end he does what Aaliyah(Shriya) has told him once about freeing slaves, The Climax is awesome set so perfect couldn't have been better.And the best scene of the movie is where he tells Malik(Ashutosh) why is he doing this and what has he chosen for himself and others who come in his way.Music's fantastic and introduced bollywood into the era of slow rock music. I have one of the song in my top list of Bollywood.I give it a 9 i know its a lot but it deserves it.." 
" One of the best Indian movie of 2006","Awarapan was different, nothing same like other bollywood romantic craps..There are a few Indian movies which are worth watching like Kalyug, Gangster, Rang De Basanti and this one..Rating:Action: 7 out of 10 (John Woo style)Story: 7 out of 10 (Awesome story with a nice Indian culture touch)Direction: 8 out of 10 (Mohit Suri did it again)Originality: 4 out of 10 (Scenes taken from A Bittersweet Life)Casting: 8 out of 10 (Emraan Hashmi, Ashutosh Rana, Purab and the Paki girl were amazing).I give it 7 out of 10 overall." 
" Best Emraan Hasmi Film","This Film is best Emraan Hashmi because hi performance was awesome and everything in this film was awesome story and songs. Emraan Hashmi need to make more films like Murder 2 and Jannat also Awarapan and Hamari Adhuri Kahani ." 
" It's 2019 and still the magic of this movie continues","No matter how much years have passed and how many times you have watched this movie it still remains has a cult classic.This is the reason of the Big fan following of Emraan Hashmi." 
" Completely Original Screenplay, Very Different, Very Interesting","I was really impressed with this movie, it was very different to so many Bollywood films out there and even Hollywood films. The acting was good, the setting beautiful and the plot very original. It had a good message at the heart of it about faith and belief in god and what I particularly liked was, it avoided delving it in to stereotypical views of female Muslims. Nevertheless there are one or two boring scenes as in too long, albeit there are some very beautiful, simple and symbolic ones too. Thankfully there's no unnecessary sex scenes (although the topic is very mildly discussed in two scenes). Emraan Hashimi was very good as was the actress who plays Aliya (very beautiful girl). Yes there are one or two unbelievable scenes but that aside its definitely worth watching, there's action and romance although zero comedy so people looking for good time should avoid. Its a movie that leaves you thinking, and I especially love the second to last scene- stunning...The music is gorgeous and fits each scene in its played in as well as the whole movie overall perfectly...." 
" wow....Emraan at his best......","In my opinion,Mohit Suri is one of the most underrated directors in Bollywood industry........I am not saying that his films are flawless....but there is a minimum standard to his films than just old wine in new bottle type Karan johar films....... his first movie Kalyug was a good thought provoking movie......was a great theme....but direction had flaws,nevertheless it was his first film.....basic problem of his movies are the sequences in the last part of the movie.....in most of his films,the climax portions are big letdowns.....like raaz,Kalyug,Crook....... But I can ensure that Awarapan is his best movie.....climax is handled very well....now coming to the story.....Shivam(Emraan Hashmi) is part of the gang lead by Bahrat malik(Ashutosh Rana)which involves in illegal activities...Malik treats Shivam as his son.....Malik has the business of selling girls for prostitution......he encounters such a girl named Reema and has love for her....but he suspects that she gave her heart to someone else.....so he instructs Shivam to keep an eye on her.....on seeing her Shivam begins to have memories of his long lost love Aliyaa(Shriya saran)......But dangers lie for Shivam as he realizes that Reema is in love with a pakistani boy......will shivam be loyal to his master malik or will he help reema......this forms the rest of the story.....Emraan dons the role of Shivam.....really great performance...refreshing to see him in a different role other than the usual womanizer roles he does......another surprising fact is that he does not have a kiss in this movie....Ashutosh Rana also delivers an excellent performance as Bharat malik.....a great actor to look out for.....Newcomer Mrinalani Sharma gives an OK performance......nothing to brag about....Shriya saran has a short role.....she has nothing much to perform.....all other actors had did there part well.....nobody disappoints..Songs are the soul of the movie......all the songs are pleasant to hear...Tera mera Rishta song goes well with the flow of the movie......and in the climax parts it gives a certain effect to the movie....Direction was gripping at parts......but Emraan-shriya romance scenes were hampering the pace of the movie...Awarapan will not disappoint you in any way.......Its a nice movie to watch" 
" If Jannat made him a star then this movie made him an Actor","This movie is all about Emraan and his acting and how he fights his inner demons. It is really interesting to see this story of a gangster doing the right things. It feels like a classic cult movie of its own genre. It has the best songs and music of that time and even today if you listen to any of the song it will not sound old. Treat to watch." 
" Good story but not entertaining","Mukesh Bhatt's production house delivers great music and hard-hitting plots. Their latest film Awarapan is no different. A friend of mine told me that it is a lot inspired by 2005 Korean film A Bittersweet Life but I don't know because I don't watch Korean films. The film was only watchable because of Emraan's terrific acting and had a good setting in Hong Kong but wasn't entertaining. Directed by Mohit Suri who also made Zehar, Kalyug and Woh Lamhe but seems to be losing his touch because Zehar & Kalyug were terrific films and Woh Lamhe was really disappointing. The best songs are Toh Phir Aao - Lounge mix, Tera Mera Rishta - Remix and Mahiya. The story was good about Shivam (Emraan Hashmi) who is trying to escape from his tragic past and memories of his lost love (Sriya Saran), Shivam lands up in Hong Kong to work for his gangster boss Malik (Ashutosh Rana). Before a trip to London, Malik tells Shivam to keep a close eye on his mistress Reema (Mrinali Sharma), but he discovers Reema is planning to escape with her Pakistani boyfriend. Overall it's OK to be watched once but not the kind of film to be bought on DVD." 
" I hate Indian Movie but it is a good one","I hate Indian movie because of there copied concepts, they always copy concepts and stories from Hollywood or they have some typical stories. But this movie is without any mistakes or any stupid thing it is fantastic movie. After Karam and Omkara I like this movie and most good thing is that all the songs are best fits on situation and of course Pakistani singers especially "Mustafa Zahid" made music a fantastic one and soundtrack "To Phir Aao is just a perfect song with very cool acting of Emraan". Whole movie with there story is very good. I have seen lots of Indian movies and I always keep expectations but they always showed me crap stuff and overacting so I left watching Indian movie a long time ago now I came back to watch this movie and it made me happy that they are now working good but I will not say all movies are still good only few are."
