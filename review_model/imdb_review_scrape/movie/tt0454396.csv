" Overall A OK movie but will be forgotten soon.","Aryan is a about a Boxers life how he stops boxing cause of the family situation and finds out how hard it is to get a job if U don't have a education. Mostly the point in the movie is that if You have a dream then Go For It, doesn't matter what it takes.Aryan is not a great movie, but a good movie to watch a Friday night. The movie has nothing great to offer than its stylish, ordinary songs but good acting from specially Sohail Khan. Sneha is OK, but still need a lot of acting classes, cause Bollywood is packed with Beauties but not talent.Aryan IS NO ROCKY, and don't even try to compare it cause you will regret watching Aryan , cause Rocky is a master piece.****SPOILER**** There is Specially one scene in Aryan which is touching when Sohail Khans Neighbor goes to Sneha's family to tell Sneha that the Noicy Aryan is all quite all day long, No Music or TV or Laughing, the only thing she hears is Aryan crying. This scene is great and small scenes like this make the movie good.The Villain in the movie is good as well, don't know his name but he did a lot of training to do this role.Overall an OK movie and I give it a 8 cause of a good attempt." 
" Good!!!!","this movie should be rated 8/10 Because OF SOME GOOD ACTION as it is an action movie which i love to watch like "Matrix" "Fight Club" which had nice fights so that is why i like it because as it has SOHAIL KHAN in it it has become really good. This should be mpaa Rated PG-13 because of some action violence. Some songs were good and as it is abhishek kapoor's first direction so it lacked some of the stuff that should be in a movie but overall i liked the movie very very much and i tell everyone to watch it. and SOHAIL KHAN AND SNEHA ULLAL Make a good pair after coming in lucky with SALMAN so i really liked the movie therefore everyone should watch it." 
" Loved it","I absolutely loved this movie. It had everything- action, emotions, and romance- without going overboard on any of them. It's almost a full circle story, everyone looked awesome, Sneha did a wonderful job seeing as this is just her second movie (and she acted much better than in Lucky). I think anyone should watch it, however if you ONLY like chick flicks, I wouldn't recommend it. It is not like Veer Zaara or Rang De Basanti, so if those are the ONLY types of movies you like, I wouldn't think you would like this movie. Personally, I like any good movie with a good plot and good/hot actors. Like I said, the actors, especially the leads, looked very good, the plot was interesting and unique, and the overall movie was gripping and entertaining. Many people probably said that there are some adult only ideas in it, but those are easily overshadowed and they are not too much for say a 10 year old to watch. Again, if you are home on a rainy Friday/Saturday night, and you are looking for an entertaining, griping, original, unique, and overall amazinggggg Hindi film, watch Aryan. I am almost positive that if you fit the basic mindset I described, you will not regret watching this movie." 
" Cinderella Man","After watching the trailer of this movie, i ended up watching it last week. The trailer gave me an impression that this was going to be a copy of Cinderella man and so it was!...Irrespective of that, being a sohail khan fan i really liked the movie however i felt sneha ullal needs some more time to mature into a nice actress, for me she is the prettiest actress in the bollywood industry but as far as acting is concerned, i couldn't see any reality..Keeping all things aside, this is an okay movie which can be watched once and once again i loved sohail khan's expressions at certain moments..As far as the story was concerned, it was too obvious for my liking. If u haven't seen Cinderella man though, u will end up really loving this movie..." 
" Very well made movie","Very good attempt and i think its a success, but this is only towards younger generation and i think they will find it very entertaining. Don't make the mistake of comparing Aryan as Rockey and Stallone to Sohail Khan because their is no similarity period. overall the movie is very original and i enjoyed it because of its originality and their is lot more to offer then glamour. It has everything action, drama, and romance. The thing that makes the movie good is acting for Sohail Khan he does a very good job and i think he should do more films like this since it fits his style, songs are very enjoyable and don't let this get caught in she shadow of big budget films like dhoom, because thats why this film hasn't been running successful."
