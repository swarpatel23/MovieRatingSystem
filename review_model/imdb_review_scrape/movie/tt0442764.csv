" films cannot be what your dil kahey !","FTII-trained veteran actor Romesh Sharma who turned producer with film Diljala in 80s, turned writer-director too this time while launching his son Karan as leading man. He also played a character in the film. What starts off as a young love story going sour due to racial and cultural differences gets into the very much known territory of love-triangle. If that is not enough there is lot of verbal exchange regarding upholding culture, values, traditions, duties, sacrifice et al. There is not even tongue-in-cheek humor to add some spice to the scenes. What times are you living in, dudes? What you get to see finally is same old, tried and tested romance of 1970s style, told umpteen times, with hardly any novelty in storyline and no style and substance in narrative. To top it film moves with a snail-paced, slow thakela tempo, loose ends with songs thrown in between without any context. I wonder how come maker thought that his audience still lives in that Stone Age? Both veteran Mr. Bachchan and Revathy tried to pull the drama with their strong performances. Both cinematographers shot both Sweden as well as Mauritius, remarkably well. Lead Actress Annabelle Walis not just looks fabulous but also acted well. 60% of talking part is in English, which is very apt in the situations, but this whole together does not salvage film from turning into a dull, vapid low energy drama. With so little in content and almost lack of conflict to carry the story forwards, and holds interest, these film tests the patience of audience. Films are made for the "today's very smart" theater going audience. You just can't make a film based on what your "Dil Jo Bhi Kahey". Right Mr. Sharma !" 
" Overall an OK movie","This is a movie about trying to listen to your heart in the face of pressure from your own family. Karan Sharma is cast as a somewhat gawky man/boy, Jai Sinha, who falls in love, but circumstances force him to restrain himself.I saw this movie on DVD in the US. Some of the dialog was in English - so I don't know how that played in the movie theaters in India, unless they dubbed that in Hindi. I liked the overall feel of the movie. The performances were good. In many situations, the plot made the characters act in a fashion very consistent with real life. I liked that. One thing that was portrayed unrealistically was the mannerism and language of Sophie's family, especially her father. His manner of speaking was as if he a landlord in India, and not a white businessman in Mauritius. Also, I didn't like the overworked ploy of making the girl fall for the guy by getting him to insult her first. The director could have been more creative on that." 
" Excellent Movie","The perfect family movie.I loved this movie.The story is poignant,the performances are realistic,the locales appealing and the filming peppy.Excellent music too.I said it once and i'll say it again.This movie is simply too good.And if anybody did not like this movie,not my problem as they are missing out on a slice of good,clean,quality cinema.Amitabh Bachchan seems to be getting better with each movie.The father-son relationship has been presented beautifully.Revathi is one under-rated actress and this movie makes full use of her talent.Karan Sharma makes a confident debut.He may look a little gawky,but that only adds to his performance.Annabelle Wallis looks ethereal and acts brilliantly.Here's a good actress in the making.Bhoomika Chawla touches your heart with her sincerity.She's simply too good.The rest of the cast provides adequate support.It truly is a pity that good movies like this are rejected and some bottom of the barrel movies end up as hits.But then,that's life........." 
" Easy Romeo and Juliet Story !","Overall, it's a nice movie, but without much to call great or special. And according to the old movies of the big B once; it's disappointing. Well.. colorful but disappointing.This was the first movie ever for both the young leads (Karan Sharma & Annabelle Wallace). And the 2 newcomers were charismatic, talented and having chemistry.It managed to deliver sweet image, but not sweet drama. Studying the stories behind the dishes, or using the historical conflict to complicate the love story, were the only unusual points. Because the rest of the movie was so usual, lacking the surprises, giving *unforgettable* solution for the whole matter at the end (too-old-it's-unused, or too-easy-it's-laughable!).The idiot attempt to assure that (Amitabh Bachchan) is shorter than (Karan Sharma) bothered me very, since we all know that if there was any taller actor than (Bachchan) then he would have no chance to work in the Indian cinema or any other cinema, being too tall to be captured on a camera!I read that in 2005 (Bachchan) was admitted to a hospital, to undergo surgery for diverticulitis of the small intestine. That nearly explains the condition of him here, appearing so weary for all the time.(Bachchan) plays rich, so rich, person. This may give you the feeling that since (Bachchan) became a rich man in real life, so he was playing himself in the movies away from his common roles during all the 1970s and the 1980s! Actually, while I know that there is no actor who plays just one role, it seems partly true since he became somewhat away from poor people in the first place, living another higher class. But here, it is clear from the very start that it is a smooth story and movie to tranquilize. So there was originally no place for anything but colored houses, stylish costumes, expensive cars.. etc.There was no amnesia, no lost-and-found child, and no (Amrish Puri) to be killed by the hands of (Bachchan) in the end, avoiding also songs with 200 dancers, forced comedy or action. (Dil Jo Bhi Kahey) wanted to be a different experience as simple romance. However this no-customary work was made customarily in itself. Surely it's less noisy compared to the classic Indian movies, yet less amusing compared to them or else; being too simple, TV-ish and poor.This is how (Romeo and Juliet) transforms into suave postcards or bedtime story. Let's say it is the tamest (Romeo and Juliet) I've ever seen."
