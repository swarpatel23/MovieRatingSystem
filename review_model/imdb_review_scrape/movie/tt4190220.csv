" Zed Plus Movie Review","Zed Plus is a classic, breezy, rib-tickling & meaningful Political satire that has come like a whiff of fresh air amidst the superficial potboilers that we are being subjected to watch these days and is a must watch for all real Cine-Maa lovers. Director, Chandraprakash Dwivedi has given Indian audience a masterpiece Political Satire which deals with the issues of a common man with a good dash of humor and entertainment which deals with the previously untouched intricacies and issues associated with the Z security provided by the Indian Government. The best part about the movie is that since the concept of the movie is totally fresh, it engages you into the proceedings right from the first frame but without thrusting itself upon you & entertains you to the core in the first half. No doubt, the movie dips a little in the second half & needed some editing there but still it is worth a watch for its simplicity & unique story telling. It is one of those rare movies which is able to convey the message that it wants to in a light hear-ted manner & without sounding preachy at all." 
" Watch it as a well written, light and fairly entertaining political satire surprisingly coming from the thoughtful director Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi.","As a pleasantly surprising, light entertainer coming from Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi, the insightful director of CHANAKYA (TV Series), PINJAR and the recent UPANISHAD GANGA (TV Series), ZED PLUS can easily be rated as one of the best political satires in the recent times supported by some exceptional dialogues & performances without shouting it loud or going overboard in its more than two hours of duration.Yes, it reminds you of a few films based on somehow similar concepts and is not a perfect classic as I felt towards the end. But still would like you to watch it considering a refreshing change from the typical romantic comedies and action movies thrown one after another promoted by few big names. In other words, if you wish to witness a film that can simply be called a director's project from start to finish then ZED PLUS is the one to go for. Performed well by many underrated actors in full control of their director, it's based on a very carefully written script which is in fact a delight to watch for most of its time and doesn't disappoint hugely post its intermission too. Beginning with some superb sarcastic comments on the governing people, it takes a good 15-20 minutes for the introductions and then begins the fun quickly maintaining the pace throughout till those (sadly) predictable concluding moments which could have been given a different turn. So its only the final 30 minutes of the film that make you feel watching something obvious and seen before diluting the overall impact of the movie putting it honestly. But as a whole it certainly comes as a much needed relief among the silly crap regularly being offered by Bollywood makers with an amazing consistency.Actually the best part of ZED PLUS that makes it worth recommending is its story telling, particularly the dialogues full of many brilliant witty remarks, idioms and representation of many recent developments in the country discussed all over. For instance watch out the way it portrays the confusion or debate over the use of Hindi and English in our government matters, VIP culture getting an added advantage disturbing the everyday life of a common man, the media playing a big role in the country's active politics, terrorism used as a triumph card by the shrewd leaders of all parties and how corruption and sudden easy money pollutes a simple, honest mind too without taking much time in just a few weeks. Personally I loved the ringtone insertion of Vande Matram and the look alike prime minister used very subtly by the thinking director so well in its key sequences.The script intelligently crafts a fine buildup after the initial introductions and then the superb performers take over from there, impressing you gradually as the story progresses. Adil Hussain as the puncturewala, takes time to grow on the viewers. But once he does, the actor proves his hidden caliber that made Dr. Dwivedi select him among many other known names that could have helped the movie commercially in pure business terms. Adil beautifully portrays the role of a simple man who at first could even allow a passenger to walk away without paying and then later becomes a greedy, selfish man looking at the opportunities coming his way in the film's second half.Mukesh Tiwari as Adil's childhood friend delivers another polished performance showing his already proved versatility yet again. Kulbhushan Kharbanda as the Prime Minister is a perfect choice resembling our current Prime Minister of the country and he is a treat to watch. K. K. Raina, another under-rated actor of our industry plays the PM's personal assistant to perfection. Rahul Singh as the security in-charge, Shivani Tanksale as Fauziya & Ekavali Khanna as Saeeda prove their talent quite boldly, whereas Sanjay Mishra once again becomes the cause of laughter heard in the theater with his repetitive yet superb act of an unknown terrorist looking for his chance to make a big name in the news media. Plus it was great to see Liliput on the screen after a long time as the petty thief among many other familiar talented faces in the supporting cast.However, the surprising fact remains that Mona Singh turns out to be the second best performer after Adil in the film playing the homely, lovable, honest wife witnessing the change coming in his husband's persona with the changing times. And she truly nails it enacting her given character wonderfully and you are sure going to see a different Mona here than all her previous performances till date.Musically, Dr. Dwivedi uses only a few songs and that too as "Sutradhar" tracks sung by Sukhwinder making an enjoyable screen appearance too along with Hrishitaa Bhatt with her well-choreographed dance moves. The songs set the mood right and so does the cinematography and background music of the film taking you into the ambiance of a small town with all realistic likable character as seen around us in our daily lives.Summing up, admittedly many might find it based on a wafer thin & unconvincing plot taking time to grow on the viewer in its initial hour having some underdeveloped side tracks too such as the Sanjay Mishra one. Moreover where the first half can easily be drawn parallels with films like PEEPLI LIVE, the latter makes you recall some earlier much famous political satires such as KISSA KURSI KA, AAJ KA M.L.A RAM AVTAR and more. Yet, I would like to rate ZED PLUS as an attempt above them all due to its simplicity, truthfulness and a well written authentic portrayal of all real life characters capable of transporting you into a different world altogether in its two hours.So do give it a chance and try not to miss watching this fairly enjoyable, well intentioned comical, political satire in the theaters as the latest pleasant offering from Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi." 
" Good Movie - Should have been titled Gaali plus plus","A very nice and refreshing movie. All characters are carefully chosen and everyone performs very very well. Adil has acted very well and has shown his versatility on his transformation. I watched Agent Vinod last week and was pleasantly surprised to see a huge change in the actor from a crisp globe trotting Colonel to a tyre puncturewala. Mona Singh also gives her best. My only sore point is the extremely frequent use of expletives in the movie - do not understand how it got a U/A certification. Otherwise a superb movie - definitely worth a watch. The expletives are not beeped. Could be embarrassing for some to watch the movie with their family." 
" A Movie for fun","Really a Movie that refreshes you. In today's movie world of Glamour this movie went unnoticed by many (including me). But one of my friends recommended it. And yes he was right. This is really a fun journey you will enjoy. I will not divulge any details. As it will rob you of the entertainment. But do watch it if you want to have a fun time.The sweet fight between Aslam and Habib is funny. Kulbhushan is good as PM. The job of Secretary is well done by Raina. And Mona Singh is superb as wife of Aslam. And besides there is inimitable Sanjay Mishra doing the Terrorist job with real fun. In totality it's really a fun journey." 
" A powerful political satire","One of the most powerful political satires in recent times, ‪Zed Plus‬ is yet another gem of a film that bombed at the Indian box-office. Directed by Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi, Zed Plus is a delectable satire on democracy and what it stands for in today's context.The movie doesn't spare religion either and shows us though a bizarre sequence of fortuitous events how a destitute Khadim (Dargah attendant) shockingly ends up with Zed Plus security. What ensues is a fascinating game of political opportunism involving the Khadim and the top leaders of the two opposing political factions.Zed Plus is a reminder of the sorry state of democracy in the 21st century India. It is also a warning and a great eye-opener. The movie's sad fate at the box-office also proves that Indian audiences merely want escapism in the name of cinematic entertainment. That realism is a completely unwanted entity.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog "A Potpourri of Vestiges"." 
" Very silly!","The story is quite silly.A very silly Indian Prime Minister's government is tottering, and so he makes a pilgrimage to an obscure shrine in a village in Rajasthan.By a silly turn of events, the protagonist finds himself covered by (the highest) Zed Plus security provided by the Central Government of India.The acting by most was below par, with only Sanjay Mishra and Mukesh Tiwari providing some sparks in their small roles.It's not a political satire....there is no underlying message....no undercurrent of corruption....no critique of an inept local government.... No social message....it's just supposed to make you laugh....which it fails to do.A few scenes in the Mandawa Palace provide an interesting glimpse of some lovely paintings and wall art.Nothing worth watching in the movie." 
" Excellent in parts,looses the steam overall....","Zed Plus by Pinjar director Dr.Chandraprakash Dwivedi is a contemporary Indian political satire much in the lines of Peepli Live. While the individual dig ins at the Indian society, media, economy and politics are far reaching, deeper and bolder but the overall lack of better editing and control over flow of events brings down the impact. Then again the efforts to put forward a conclusion/solution also hurts the sense of satire that was running well enough in the 1st half. While the last scene of Nattha working at the city construction site was the best part of Peepli Live and the associated irony of the situation, here the choice of honesty and self realization as retort does not work. But then the film definitely has its moments of brilliance. From the English affluent Samata Mukherjee to the Modi looking Manmohan speaking PM there are quite a few classy strokes. Adil Hussain and Khulbhusan Kharbanda both find themselves uncomfortable in the unknown territory of characterization but somehow pull through. K.K Raina being a far superior actor puts in a fine effort even if put into similar problems. Sanjay Mishra continues his golden form from Kick/Aankhon Dekhi and puts in another hilarious cameo very similar to the meaty role in "Phaas Gaya Obama". The three irritating numbers from Sukhwinder Singh (with Hrishita Bhaat dancing rising from the dead) where he puts in all to make comeback in a non-existent opportunity needed to be chopped off in the first place. The film do have its heart in the right place however an overtly-emotional approach and amateurish efforts mostly from the crew leaves you wanting."
