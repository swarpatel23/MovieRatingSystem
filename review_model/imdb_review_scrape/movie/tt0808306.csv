" Giving a new meaning to character 'driven', Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd is a bus journey of varied characters on honeymoon to Goa","Honeymoon Travels Private Ltd: Movie Review Rating: *** Honeymoon Travels Private Ltd, as one expects, is a story of six diverse couples on their honeymoon tour to Goa. But what one doesn't predict is the experience in store for them.There is a Bengali couple with a conservative husband (Kay Kay Menon) and a raring-to-go wife (Raima Sen). There is a perfect Parsi couple (Abhay Deol  Minissha Lamba) who are always in sync with each other and never ever catch up a fight. A Gujarati duo flawlessly named Hitesh (Ranvir) and Shilpa (Dia Mirza) forms the imperfect couple. Then there is an NRI Richie (Vikram Chatwal) married to a Bambaiyya girl (Sandhya Mridul). A college lovebird duo (Amisha Patel  Karan Khanna) and an elderly couple (Boman Irani  Shabana Azmi) complete the dozen honeymooners. So what's the story? Well their characterizations itself! The character driven film takes the story forward with each couple's flashback narrative and a fast-forward tale telling in a span of the six days of their honeymoon in Goa.With its six assorted anecdotes, this light-hearted romantic comedy tries to capture the varied flavours of love. You might love some story, laugh on some, relate to some and perhaps even reject some. But there's enough on the platter to keep you satiated. How and what you digest depends on your love appetite.Debutante director Reema Kagti (who has assisted on films like Lagaan and Dil Chahta Hai) adopts a fascinating storytelling technique. Despite six separate stories the film isn't episodic which gives more scope of chemistry between the characters that forms the major highlight of the screenplay. The flashback fable of each couple unravels in an interesting black-n-white frame with a retro song to support each. The use of a radio show to narrate the flashback episodes is a unique idea but might not connect with those accustomed to conventional narrative techniques. Each flashback installment is kept crisply short.The screenplay is intelligently innovative though at instances it even resorts to some cinematic clichés. The best example of the former being Raima Sen's para sailing sequence in a sari and for the latter it's when Raima Sen displays her martial arts antics  nevertheless both the scenes keeps you in splits. The treatment is rather subtle and at times is left for the audience to apprehend  like the culmination of Karan Khanna's character.There are a couple of surprises in the climax. (And this doesn't include the identity of the biker who follows the bus from the start. That's revealed in the initial reels itself). In fact the bigger of two surprises will make your jaw drop out of disbelief. But if you don't mind cinematic liberties for fun-factor in films, it might just stretch a smile on your face out of the hilarity. However it makes you wonder why in the end, the director did not bank upon the build up made for this surprise throughout the film through the clues thrown out (this might sound gibberish while you read but you will understand this only when you watch the film). If you aren't a keen observer, the clues thrown in by the director to invoke suspense in the film, might become apparent to you only on a second viewing.While most of the characters have put in a decent performance, Kay Kay Menon steals the show. His characterization is the strongest or perhaps he has made it so believable with his sincere act. You instantly connect with his character of a modern day man but with a conservative traditional backdrop. The actor often relegated to serious roles in films like Sarkar and Black Friday, surprises with his flair for comedy. And his now-popular dance movements in the song 'Sajnaji Vari Vari' is one of the major highlights of the film. His fight sequence with Ranvir Shorey in the bus is absolutely hilarious. How one wishes the film had more of the brilliant Ranvir. Boman Irani never goes wrong with his character, then be it any role in the world. So even as Oscar Fernandes, he perfects the accent for a Goan Christian. Raima Sen gets a meaty role and impresses both with her looks (despite being sari-clad throughout the film) and performance. Karan Khanna doesn't have much to speak but emotes well. Dia Mirza looks damn cute when she cries in the opening scene of the film. Minissha has a charming aura and indulges in an impeccable salsa with Abhay Deol. And when it comes to Shabana Azmi, the flawless actress doesn't need an approval for her act. Amisha Patel is supposed to play an irritating bimbo character and she succeeds in irritating you to the core. But don't misconstrue it for she doing justice to her character. She actually irritates and comes as the only actor miscast in the film with her constant hamming.Overall Honeymoon Travels is an entertaining journey. Do take the bus. Recommended!" 
" Feelin' good!","I was very excited about watching Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. until the reviews came out and made it sound like another mediocre Bollywood movie. Well, let me tell you my friends, the movie is anything but mediocre! In fact its one of most endearing movies I have seen in a while. All through the film I had a big smile on my face with many laugh-out-loud moments. Which may have been caused by Boman Irani's accent and twinkle in his eye, Kay Kay's (award winning) Bengali prudeness followed by the 'Sajnaji Vari Vari' jig or the oh-so-perfectly-synchronized couple with the big secret etc. The movie has its dramatic moments also that are compelling - no melodrama and no under-playing either, resulting in just the right impact.Every story holds your interest (admittedly some more than others) and the characters are as flesh and blood as they can get. The casting is perfect resulting in believable performances. I watched the movie a second time and noticed the little things that I had missed the first time, which lead the viewer to the surprise elements. Reema Kagti's attention to detail made my respect for her direction, one notch higher. Not to forget the thumbprint of the hugely talented Farhan Akhtar.'Honeymoon Travels' is not flawless but the flaws are few and far between and can be forgiven. Its a movie that made me believe that you don't have to have big budgets, big stars, gloss and pretentious movie makers to entertain. The most important thing is that the movie should have a soul. Great job team of Honeymoon Travels! We want more!!" 
" A cocktail of fantasy and reality.","Though there is no firm story line as such , the movie succeeds in holding interest of the viewer , with clever editing , wonderful landscapes of Goa , running commentary of the FM radio channel , sprayed with matching songs , and some special effects to stir the viewer unexpectedly . i have called this movie a cocktail of reality and fantasy, because there is a couple , played by Deol and Lamba , who are so perfect in every thing , till the lady starts suspecting him , due to his disappearance at odd hours . And then , much to our surprise , to see some thing like this in an otherwise social film , the husband and wife are shown to have supernatural powers ! Pinky also dreams about the pearls and comes across a real one on the beach . Arjun Rampal and Diya Mirza , the lovers , who finally manage to elope , as she has been married against her consent, are shown to take shelter in a jungle house ,again a fantasy , running away from the real world ! but they have to face the reality of being chased by the killers , their bullets , and if the character played by Azmi , of a very mature and a loving individual , who supports the couple morally and also practically , by motivating the entire group of travelers , to stand by this couple , they would be perhaps dying drenched in blood , as it's been shown in many other movies , like Ek Duje Ke Liye et AL . This clever usage of the support system , enables the motley of characters , to finally end their travel happily , and memorably. Some how , K. K. Menon's character needing a cold drink inadvertently consumed , which has been laced with some exuberant drug , didn't quite feel right. What happens when the effect is gone ? in any case , he shows the two angles of a typical Indian husband very realistically. one with stringent outlook , and the other with a carefree attitude , enjoying the party . The couples look sensuous , and Lamba gives a fantastic dance number , with Deol to support. and remember , their dancing is so surreal , because they have those powers ? Boman Irani , some how looks as if he is not interested in doing this film , his heart is not fully into it , and you can feel it. could have done better. This movie is a refreshing change from those soap operas we watch on the television , or the other run of the mill ones , which depict same old marital discords or excessive love. But it is inexplicable , why the character played by Mrudul , decides to stay put in the relationship , even on the truth dawning on her , that he is gay ,and will not be able to sexually satisfy her , though she is so attractive, young and full of life . Her decision to act so , and her comment that you need me and i need you , some how doesn't seem to tally with the lofty principles of real love and understanding others , the movie professes to deliver as a message . Perhaps the director was too tempted to show all the characters smiling at the camera ,in the last shot ? It is not certainly a waste of time or money , to go through this honeymoon experience , which may be quite different than your own , or what you might have expected to watch !" 
" It's quite good","I enjoyed it. It started off a bit slow and nauseating... much like the story of most real life marriages but then picked up as soon as things started to go wrong. An all-star Bollywood cast tries to show us how life truly is with marital relationships by serving up a taste of just about everything with a view into the lives of seven couples honeymooning together in Goa, India. I liked the idea of casting no name actors in pivotal roles as was done with this film and the addition of the risqué elements (such as homosexuality and a view of how some Indian men and women handle it, the supernatural match made in superhero heaven etc. etc.). HTPL is a different movie and even if it wasn't very well received it was very well acted. Blink and you'll miss Arjun Rampal in a guest role that enables him to throw salt on one of the husband's wounds. Kay Kay Menon was especially good as the husband of Raima Sen's character (the element of an older man married to a much young woman and the trials they face). Sen also holds her own. Amisha Patel is wonderful as clueless Bimbo wife in love with Bollywood-like fairy tales and delusions. Shabana Azmi was excellent as Nahid, a widow experiencing a new lease on life. Dia Mirza and Abhay Deol co-star. By the way, the music was awesome, I went out and got the soundtrack as soon as I saw the film because I fell in love with nearly every song." 
" Flick for a lazy Sunday afternoon","Six honeymoon couples on a bus trip to Goa - that lays the table wide open. Director Reema Kagti could have served whatever she wanted. A comedy about fumbling into martial bliss, a drama about discovering the challenges of being married, a social comment about how society and upbringing makes people view the institution of marriage differently. What she opts for is a multi-course meal with flavors of each. The result, an okay film that I'd suggest be better watched on a DVD at home instead of paying for a movie ticket.There is all the variety you want. There is the married-against-wishes couple (Ranvir-Diya), married-and-at-peace couple (Abhay-Minnisha), married-and-u-have-changed-now couple (Kay Kay-Raima), married-and-i'm-confused couple (Newbie-Amisha), married-to-the-wrong-sex couple (Chatwal-Sandhya) and married-and-married couple (Boman-Shabana).When you are telling a story about ordinary people and ordinary lives, you have a difficult task at hand. It is because you are telling the story of the very people sitting on the chairs of the movie hall and looking at the screen. You cannot lie to them or tell a story otherwise because it is their story. They know the beginning and they know the end. You have to be exact or you'll fail. If Kagti's story reminds anyone of their honeymoon and brings back forgotten memories, I guess whatever I say about this movie won't matter to them. That is the charm of telling simple stories. However, personally, I doubt this movie will remind anybody of anything.The outstanding salsa by Abhay and Minnisha is the only take-home from the movie. 'Vaari-vaari' number is sure to be heard on the dance floors for a coming few months. Kay Kay has displayed his versatility and I'm sure we are going to see more of him in comedies. Amisha needs to learn that she need not keep smiling all the time, even while saying her lines. Boman, Shabana - these are minor challenges for them and they easy overcome. Raima Sen - I think she gets more screen time than any of the other female protagonists and she does full justice. Other actors get to do their bit and are okay." 
" funny honeymoon travelers","'Honeymoon Travels Private Ltd' is about 6 newly wed couples who come together during their honeymoon: There is a Bengali couple that comprises of a conservative husband (Kay Kay) and a ready to get wild wife (Raima). There is an envious seemingly perfect couple (Abhay  Minissha), college sweethearts (Amisha  Karan), an imperfect Gujarati couple Hitesh (Ranvir) and Shilpa (Dia Mirza) forms, a foreigner Richie (Vikram Chatwal) married to a hyperactive Bombay girl (Sandhya Mridul) and an older couple (Boman Irani  Shabana Azmi). The rest of the plot consists of their story together during this traveling period, their self discovery and their true feelings for one another.Kay Kay is excellent as the slightly shy and conservative husband. His dance in 'Sajnaji Vari Vari' is awesome and remains to be one of the most memorable scenes of the movie. He does pleasantly surprise with his comedic talents (since he's more known for his serious movies). Raima Sen is brilliant and she shows us a sexy side. Shabana Azmi never lets you down and after a long time, Boman Irani finally gives a decent performance (he's not loud nor annoying this time). Abhay Deol and Minisha Lamba share a nice chemistry, though they tend to be a little over the top. Amisha Patel succeeds in annoying and Karan Khanna hardly does anything. Ranvir Shorey makes impresses with a brief role while Dia Mirza doesn't. Sandhya Mridul is charming and wonderful while Vikram Chatwal is wooden.Kagti's direction is decent and she tells the story well. However, there's something missing in the ending. It seems incomplete. One may wonder why such a finale was chosen.All in all, this is a light hearted comedy and it does provide some laughs along with a few serious moments. Well, serious enough to keep you engaged, not to break down in tears. The 6 stories are nicely combined and the actors share a very comfortable chemistry. Something to enjoy with friends." 
" unique, fun, watch it","This movie is just fun, it's funny and enjoyable. It's about six couples who go on a roadtrip honeymoon, each of them with very different and interesting backgrounds which are revealed in amusing flashbacks. The couples go through various emotions and events. The directing is great and the story touches on a number of issues that most bollywood movies are scared of.great Soundtrack - this is a modern movie with a modern songs but features golden classics in the flashback scenesnarration - the movie features some creative narrating which is coolboman irani- this guy is just great, one of the best comedians in bollywood. He can make you laugh hysterically without being extremely eccentric all the time like other comic greats (johnny lever, paresh rawal, etc.) old blends with new in this flick and while you wont walk away saying "wow this was the greatest movie in all of civilization" -- especially after the abrupt ending which makes u wonder if they had to cut the movie short due to timing or length -- you will probably be glad you saw it." 
" Movie, I watched during my honeymoon","This movie released when I got married and went for my honeymoon. So precisely it is 1st movie I watched with my spouse and we thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Though there are some characters which weren't defined nicely. But KK and Raima as couple, steals the show. Abhay and Minissha were good too. Boman and Shabana were ok. Ranveer Shorey was best of all but had limited role. Amisha Patel was cute. Sandhya Mridul, Vikram chatwal and Karan Khanna were annoying.
A good movie you can enjoy with your better half. Watch it majorly for KK Menon and songs of the movie. Good directorial debut by Reema Kagti." 
" very bad movie","Worst one, waste of my time. The man wrote the story has nothing in head. Too bad" 
" Joyride in HONEYMOON TRAVELS, still I 'may not' travel again","The movie is about honeymooners on a journey to Goa. The characterization and the chemistry between them were too realistic and on the spot. There is this sensational- 'salsa'tion by Abhay and Minisha not to be missed. The flashbacks are screen played with Bollywood classics numbers and narrated too well by the director. I expected much from the director who assisted movies like DCH and Lagaan but this was let down due to a sudden ending. There were a couple of turns near the movie end which took me by surprise still weren't too pleasant. Still a good movie to watch with your friends or better with your fiancé/ girlfriend." 
" Good in parts at times awful","There's a saying- All thats shining is not gold or a better one will be everything that is different is not greatThis film tells a different story which is relatable it tells 6 different stories like SALAAM E ISHQ which was a long 3 hour bore with some stories working and some notThis is better then that as most stories seem realistic Frankly this different stories in 1 film may seem intriguing but actually it gets too boring and takes time to absorb the stories Analysis of each story Boman- Shabana Good story and the relationship of Boman and Shabana is fantastic but the last part of the story is too sudden Boman and Shabana make a nice group like the elders in the team and act their parts naturally Boman often irritating with his comic acts except the Munnabhai Series and some more films does a great job here and seems natural except his hideous wig Shabana Azmi too is a fun to watchKaykay- Raima Sen This story seems believable but the way things are sorted out between them seems too quick but yet the paraglyding scene and KK's drunken act are superb Kay Kay is natural in his role and entertains with his charm and his talent He makes the most ordinary scenes too stand out Raima Sen too does wellKaran Khanna- Amisha Patel and Vikram Chaitwal- Sandhya Mridul The scenes between Amisha and Karan are too irritating and hence jar and the entire gay angle seems better avoided though quite believable and the conclusion too is too far fetchedRanveer- Dia- Arjun The story is good and when Dia walks away with Arjun seems believable but the entire chase could be avoided Ranveer is a delight to watch and is a true natural, hope this actor gets off this DKD and all crap he is doing off late and come back to such cinema Dia is okay while Arjun has too short a roleAbhay- Minishaa this is the weirdest story and the SFX parts looks too stupid in a film as realistic as this Abhay irritates here and thank god has come a long way now though he was good in SNT and AHISTA AHISTA Minishaa is okayDarshan Jariwala this track seems too far fetched in second half and the twist of the young guy doesn't work Darshan is a true natural and likable" 
" Doesn't rock, but doesn't suck either...","Reema Kagti's Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. is just the kind of film that can be a professional movie reviewer's nightmare. How does one write a review of a film that has neither any exceptional high-points nor any downright bad elements? One that doesn't rock, but doesn't suck either? No praise, no curse. Thank God, I'm not a professional reviewer.We all know what Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. is all about - six newly married couples going on their honeymoon together. Though it has elements of mutual discovery one would expect in a theme like this, the director's intention is not to explore that aspect of the couples' honeymoon. The end result is a film where you get some nice, funny moments sprinkled in an uneven fashion across the 108 minute duration of the film, but that's just about it. Sometime you do long for some further insight into a few aspects, but you don't let that bother you, because a few minutes into the film, the director has made clear what she wants you to expect.It is a cute film - reasonably short in duration, populated with a plethora of characters who in their own sweet way show you (even though intermittently) something that makes you go, "yeah, that happened to someone I know", but largely stop short of making you care for them. You know that each track would not get more than a few minutes, so why bother? It seems that while writing the script, Reema Kagti had to struggle hard to introduce some 'conflict' in each of the tracks. There was no need actually. We would have been satisfied even if the film was only about the fun-filled interaction between the couples. But the writer/director was probably not satisfied. While these conflicts work in some of the tracks, in others they appear very contrived. The cutest couple (Abhay Deol-Minissha Lamba) gets saddled with a 'conflict' that borders on the ridiculous, but which is nevertheless funny in a mindless way.I thought that the Amisha Patel-Karran Khanna track and its connection with the Sandhya Mridul-Vikram Chatwal track was the most interesting, it only it was fleshed out a bit more and was given a more complete resolution. And the resolution to the Sadhya Mridul-Vikram Chatwal track is quite unconvincing. It also makes me wonder if the Indian cinema would ever mature enough to have a complete film based on these tracks - a kind of Brokeback Mountain meets Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna.Even though it is the typical enjoy-while-it-lasts kind of flick, there are a few images that still linger on in my mind. The brilliantly choreographed and performed tango by Abhay Deol and Minissha Lamba, the unstructured choreography of Sajna Ji Vari Vari, the impromptu fantastical tale narrated by Bomman Irani and Shabana Azmi while describing the way they met, Raima Sen's thrilling adventure in the sky - these sequences provide a brief glimpse into what a great film this could've been, if only the writer/director had a bit more clarity on what she wanted to achieve. And pray, what was the need to resort to such horrendous clichés like a wayward daughter returning to her dad and step-mom after being jilted or the fight sequence with the goondas! And why that speech by Shabana Azmi at that end? Why? Finally, a few questions for the Akhtar family: Javed Akhtar - You did bring in a breath of fresh air with your lyrics at a time when a certain Mr. Sameer dominated the scene with his dil-jigar-aashiqui-deewangi brand of shayari. Don't you think it's time you stopped using the halka-chhalka-mehka-behka routine in your lyrics and came up with something new? Zoya and Farhan Akhtar - What was the reason for giving such a step-motherly treatment to your real life step-mom, Shabana Azmi? She certainly deserved more meat in her character.Shabana Azmi - Was this film done just as a favor to your family? Your role in this film certainly doesn't behoove your caliber."
