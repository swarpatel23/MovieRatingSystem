" Error in Director's Identity.","Though the name is correct, the link takes you to actor IRFAN KHAN. He is not the director of the film. The Director IRFAN KHAN is a well known Film & TV Producer/Director and can be found on IMDb Resume. IMDb needs to change the error.The film created a lots of buzz, the reasons are listed below. 1 First film to be shot entirely in Bulgaria. 2 The crew was total Bulgarian that has worked on many Hollywood films. 3 20th Century Fox distributed the film. 4 Miss Bulgaria 'Natalie Gurkova' debut in the film. 5 Special effects, though done in India, were world class.The film did not do much at the box office primarily because of poor publicity and butchered editing by vested interest. In the end it served no one purpose not the creator nor the marauders."
