" Copy of "The Eye"","I was expecting a more chilling movie than "Bhoot" but it was not that scary.For most of us it looks like an adaptation of "The Sixth Sense" but in fact I saw a very very similar movie few days back and it was named "The Eye". The name of the original Chinese movie was "Jian Gui" (View more at "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325655/").Urmila's performance was good. Remaining cast was okay. The music and background score was quite average as compared with other Ram Gopal Verma's movies. The good thing was it has good pace and keep you glued to the seat." 
" Not as good as I expected","I was expecting Naina to be a really good movie after I read the interesting story about a girl in London who lost her eyesight and parents in a car accident. She was raised by her grandmother and when she became a young woman she got an eyes donor. After the operation she started to see strange things like dead people, shadows and bad incidents that are yet to happen. The first half was quite good and relentless but the second half was very slow, boring and depressing when Naina went to India from London to unsolve the mystery. If you liked Urmila's other two horror films Kaun & Bhoot then Naina is probably the film for you. Personally I liked both of them. It is a remake of a Korean film "The Eye" I've not seen it but most people said that The Eye is better and I think that the Hollywood version is due to the end of 2007 but i'm not sure. Overall this film is OK to be watched once and my verdict is 5/10 if the second half was good then I might of given it a 6-7 out of 10 but their is no chance that I will rate it 8-10 out of 10." 
" And I Thought "Eye 10" Was Bad...","Let's be perfectly honest. "The Eye 10" was bad. The fart jokes may have been an excellent opportunity for the Pang Brothers to thumb their noses at the film-making establishment (especially of the genre-kind), but farting did nothing to enhance the ghost story they were trying to tell. Anyone who disagrees...is lost.But "Naina," a "had to be licensed or else there's a lawsuit a-brewing" remake of the Pang Brothers original "Eye" is a real stinker. Let me qualify for a moment; I'm a sucker for any kind mimicry or remaking, as long as it's good. I'll watch the same derivative sequel-like Asian ghost story over and over and over again (Eye, Ringu, Dark Water, Phone, Red Shoes, Red Eye, One Missed Call 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) as long as it is well done. But "Naina" busts the bank. The film has no fart-jokes, but its got the same flatulent problem--namely, hilarity, that doesn't smell too much like hilarity, that's been inserted into the script with a crowbar made in India.Being a Bollywood remake of a serious ghost story, the "comic relief" (term used lightly) and distinct style of overacting isn't surprising in "Naina." Watching this film is a bit like watching "The Eye" (a heartwrenching, small, personal film) trying to bust out into a Broadway-style song and dance routine. Oil and water. For example, early on the hilarity comes in the form of Naina's (cornea transplantee's) grandmother. She harasses hospital personnel, inappropriately burns incense in the hospital lobby, and continually barrages the doctors with "hilarious" questions about her poor, poor granddaughter. The "funny" character got tiring real, real fast and completely served to deflate any tension the director may have been trying to attain. Maybe he should watch the original one more time.The same kind of Bollywood-like, paper-thin character qualities flowed into the protagonist Naina as well. Her eyes bulged out of her head like Popeye when confronted with supernatural occurrences, and the voiceovers were always overacted. For example, check out Naina's string of monosyllables meant to convey horror and exasperation ("Uh-Ah-No-Wha-Uh-Ah-Huh-No") while she witnesses "the other side" from the backseat of a taxi (and her lips aren't even parted). Attack of the voice-over from hell! It is the typical cartoonery found in Bollywood films. No subtlety anywhere.And yet I am perplexed. Overall, I'd say the film was lensed very lushly. Nice colors and camera angles; on the whole, the photography is top notch. Yet, when the director fills the frame with the baldheaded young-boy-cancer-patient who befriends Naina, things explode into utter wrongness. Somebody seriously needed to check this kid's makeup. As someone else pointed out in a review on IMDb, the skullcap the kid was wearing (head shaved due to brain surgery) wasn't fitted or finished properly. And again, allow me to explain; I'm no perfectionist when it comes to genre films. I'll put up with just about everything. As long as I'm entertained, I can look past the biggest plot holes, rubber monster suits, and rattling background sets. But this skullcap gets the award for the Worst Ever Makeup Job I've Seen In My Life. The color of the cap doesn't match his head; when the child actor emotes by raising his eyebrows, the ends of the skullcap wrinkle up unnaturally; the cutout around his ears is clearly visible, as well as how the skullcap is not properly attached to the back of his head--and I think I saw some hair protruding through the back around his neck. It is atrocious. Unbelievably so, especially when you take into consideration the overall professionalism of every other aspect of the film. Who on the crew had a three-martini lunch that day? Hmmm...Final word: Even if you are a "I'll watch any derivative film just because it's horror" person like me, trust me and skip "Naina." You've seen it all before, only it was actually good the last time." 
" Just good intentions and sincere effort don't make a GOOD film.","I recently saw "Naina" at a multiplex in. I was hurt! It hurts to see a movie made with sincere Effort and Intention, succumb to failure. But then, if good intentions and great effort were the only criteria required for a movie's success, then "Naina" could become a blockbuster. But, that's not the case! Just good intentions and sincere effort don't make a GOOD film. So what does?? The Answer is - "Just one and only one thing-- A Good Script." This is the core area where "Naina" actually failed. Despite having an interesting story, innovative treatment, eye catching cinematography and great sound & special effects the film couldn't strike a chord with the audience, because of the flawed script. The Basic Four Progressive Comments on 'Naina' which I could think of were as follows: 1. Characterization: The problem with Naina is the pace at which emotions are thrown at the audience. Before the audience can digest one aspect of Naina's emotion, she starts to portray another. This results in her character failing to strike a chord with the audience, as they can't fully relate to her emotions and therefore are not able to empathize with her. EMPATHY of the audience for the lead character is a must for all movies to succeed. Because only when the audience empathizes with the characters, they can feel for them, cry-- when they cry, laugh-- when they laugh, are scared-- when they are scared. The empathy is a critical must. In order to make the audience to worry, sympathize, or be concerned for 'Naina's' situation, first they should be allowed fall in love with her, only then will they have any reason to empathize or sympathize or whatever emotion one needs from them. The characterization of Naina in the script doesn't allow the audience to realize this bond of empathy with her. For example -in the movie "Black" The little blind girl's enthusiasm and exuberance on feeling the water for the first time is empathized by the audience, because leading up to that situation, the audience had already been allowed to, go through, and suffer all the pain in her life as a blind child, and so they were in a better position to relate to her emotions. If the audience had got a little more chance to see, what Naina's character has to go through as a blind girl, while still keeping a positive outlook on life, I am sure the empathy aspect would have worked better. 2. One dimensional & Single layered approach: Once Naina's character starts having the visions of the dead, the whole movie takes that direction Â… and that's it. It's one visionary encounter after another, then another, then another. The element of anxiety and fear diminishes with each repetition. One has to be very careful with the anxiety/curiosity element particularly in the 'Thriller' genre, which 'Naina' belongs to, because the whole movie is spun around these elements. Agreed it's the most difficult of tasks to maintain a high level of anxiety and tension in the audience throughout the movie. But then, making a good thriller movie was never an easy job in the first place. In order to maintain the level of tension in a thriller, multi-dimensional approach comes very handy; which can be done by creating a no. of interesting characters, with important roles to play in the main plot and showing different sequences from each of their point of views. For Example in the movie "Executive Decision" (An Action Thriller) the multi-dimensional element has been used very well. But then, I agree there are some movies where you can't use a multi-dimensional approach. Maybe the creator of Naina thought so too, Because as the whole story of Naina is lead character driven, and is basically the sequencing of the dramatic encounters faced by her. As it is primarily her story, so maybe demanded to be told only from her point of view. Even if the story demanded one dimensional approach i,e. to be told from Naina's POV, a suggestion is that, The script could have created sub-texts/plots to the Main Plot. This would have added variety and novelty to the Main plot, while helping in maintaining the anxiety level of the audience, without being repetitive. Once the Main plot (who's cornea did she receive, why was she getting these weird visions and what was to become of her?) is established, it can be treated as a an under current effect i,e. kept in the background, but always hovering in the audience's thought, while new sub plots can be created, where each sub plot arouse new puzzles for the audience to solve, but somehow points towards the main plot. This kind of multi-layered treatment helps especially in the thrillers/horrors genre to raise and maintain the anxiety and tension levels in the audience through major part of the movie. 3. Placement of the Final Sequence: This is strange but true. The best sequence in the whole movie was undoubtedly the final sequence (it single handedly lifted the standard of the movie), But which somehow seemed a misfit in the storyline. The reason it seemed so, was because the supposedly (the village girl part) climax scene had just preceded the final sequence. The audiences almost were ready to leave their chairs, when suddenly the final-climax scene is thrown at them. This actually isolated the final sequence from the rest of the movie, which was a tragedy, because no doubt it was the best filmed sequence of the whole movie. Placement of scenes in the correct sequence (which never has a fixed formula) is a very critical aspect for a good Movie.Please don't think that this is a critic talking! Because it's not. I am no Critic. I am just an ordinary guy who is a lover of "Beautiful Cinema." Cinema which compels your thoughts to keep giving it a backward glance, while your body has already moved on is 'Beautiful Cinema'." 
" Superb Flick which didn't get its due.","********CONTAINS SPOILERS********* OK First of all if you watch this movie with a thought that its the copy of the 'The Eye', then please don't watch it. Naina has definitely got some elements from this Hollywood Remake. But the concept in the movie, the accident happened with the village girl Khemi, are quite original and the reasons she is accused for death is quite natural because such superstitions does exist in the villages of India even today.Naina was never promoted as a Horror movie. It was a supernatural thriller which got great reviews upon its release but couldn't get decent collections to get a commercial successful status. The film had great special effects and sound design.Urmila Matondkar is absolutely brilliant, Marvellous. I can't say anything more about this superb actress. She is the best we have in Bollywood today for thriller genre. Watch her in the climax when she struggles to get people out from the Train. Her act shakes u off your feet and moves your hand to clap for this efficient lady. I shouldn't say that she should have been nominated for this film.The film has some problems, but Urmila's acting keeps you on the edge. All in all a wonderful flick." 
" A new version of Crime and Punishment's Novel","Naina somehow reminded me "Crime and Punishment" novel written by Russian author "Fyodor Dostoevsky" but in compare of that unique novel it can be considered as the weak version which tried to change the story path. Considering it as an Indian art work,i admired the artistic features of the movie and also outstanding animation scenes. Naina movie has stunning animations and the music generally inside the movie is attached the the story which makes a good harmony. near end of the movie (30 minutes to the end) you have the feeling that characters of the movie are running from one since to another, also it give the feeling that this movie could be finished in so many better ways." 
" Yet another terrible "copy and paste"","No matter how much the Indian viewers/media try to hype "Bollywood", Naina proves that Bollywood is not capable for producing original ideas. I would highly recommend watching the original HK flick called Jian gui (aka "The Eye") rather that watching a "copied and pasted" laughable Indian version. Naina proves that Bollywood not only "frame to frame" copies foreign films but does a terrible job doing it! The producers did not even have a decency to change the name of the movie!The plot, framing and in fact the lines are identical. When will the Indian producers realize that they cannot get away with crime. I am surprised that no one has sued the filmmakers for such a blatant copyright infringement. The performance of Urmila is laughable and the FX are very amateurish!P" 
" Avoid Like the Plague","My daughters and I are fans of foreign movies. We decided to rent this one, because we assumed by reading the DVD box, it sounded like "The Eye", which we liked. That didn't deter us from wasting money on this hand-sized version of the Black Hole of Calcutta. From the very first minute of the movie until the horrid ending, we laughed, winced, watched in disbelief of the spectacle that unfolded before our eyes--organs we wish we hadn't had in our heads while viewing this travesty. My daughters, who are 7 and 11, even thought the effects / acting (overly hammy) / deserved a good flogging. As I saw from the other comments, the bald-wig makeup, unfortunately, was the movie's only saving grace. Take it from a man and his two lovely daughters, spend your rupees on something better, like a root canal. Your eyes will thank you." 
" I didn't see "The Eye" first, so...","First off, I'll have to take the word of everyone who claims "Naina" is a ripoff of "The Eye". Since I've never seen it, I can't confirm or deny.Second, as an American viewer, I appreciated the notable absence of the "big song-and-dance" number that seems to make its way into most Bollywood films -- no matter the genre. The grandmother is endearing even if she seems a bit out of place."Bhoot" was a better offering purely as a horror film. Not that "Naina" didn't have its moments, but it wasn't so much scary as merely creepy. The first time Naina comes face-to-face with Khemi is a prime example of what I mean (and if you want to know more than that you'll have to watch it).But "Naina" has a special place for me because it was my introduction to Urmila Matondkar -- quite possibly THE most exquisitely beautiful woman in the world. And for her -- or any sighted person -- to play the role of a blind woman and do it with eyes wide open is a challenge. That Urmila was completely *believable* as a blind woman says a lot about her talent.And to a couple of earlier reviewers: The bald child in the hospital was a GIRL, and Naina was NOT blind from birth -- she was blinded in an accident at age 5. I wouldn't bring it up, but if you're going to call somebody out about attention to detail you should really make sure your own slip isn't showing first." 
" I DON'T NEED ANY MORE OPERATIONS","Naina loses her sight as a child and is cared for by her grandmother. As a young adult, she undergoes a cornea transplant, and 18 minutes into the film she sees dead people, a side effect of transplants. She discovers who gave her the eyes in London and it happens to be from a small village in India, a nation which has a shortage of corneas to transplant for their people.This was a made for TV film and has the word "intermission" appear half way through. I was bored. English subtitles." 
" Mooove on. no no no no no","The only spoiler you need to avoid is this movie. As it will spoil your evening. Its funny that in India cows can be considered sacred, but apparently not my time. What can be said about this movie that already has not been said about Afghanistan? Its advertised as the story of a girl who lost her eyesight, not talent. I see now why India doesn't have a Hollywood! Bad acting. And please, pick a language. If you're looking for the soundtrack, just save yourself the time and download drums. I wish I was blind after seeing this film. Even the cows didn't want to take part in this film. This is 105 minutes of my life that I will never get back." 
" Bolly Eye.","With Easter coming up,I decided to search around for a Bollywood Horror DVD that I could give to a friend as a present.Searching round on Amazon Uk,I was surprised to stumble upon a Bollywood chiller,which had only come out on Region 1 DVD,which led to me getting ready to look into Naina's eyes.The plot:Sitting in the back seat of her parents car, Naina Shah gets caught up in a car crash,which kills her parents,and leaves Shah blind.20 years later:Since she has become blind,Shah's aunt has looked at every option possible for Shah to regain her sight.Close to giving up,the family suddenly receive news that a suitable donors have been located,and that surgery can be performed on Shah.After living for 20 years blind,Shah has mixed feelings about regaining her sight,but decides to make her family happy,by agreeing to the operation.Opening her newly put-in eyes,Shah is told by Dr. Samir Patel that she may see strange "illusions" as she adjusts to a new vision.Laying in a hospital bed,Shah hears a strange noise.Looking across the room,Shah is terrified to discover that she can now see the tormented spirits of the dead.View on the film:Taking (uncredited) inspiration from the Pang brothers Horror film The Eye, the screenplay by co-writer/(along with Sagar Pandya & Anjum Rajabali) director Shripal Morakhia disappointingly fails to show any hint of the 20 year toll that Shah (played by a very good,eye- catching Urmila Matondkar) spent blind,which blinds the viewer from being able to fully experience the horror that Shah now faces,and also stops the relationship with her caring relatives to be fully explored.Whilst they fail from building a back story,the writers give the swift 104 minute running time, (with no songs!)a very creepy atmosphere,thanks to keeping Shah in an increasingly disorientated state,and also showing the ghosts/spirits as figures for sympathy,rather than fear.Backed by a silky score from Salim & Suleiman,director Shripal Morakhia reveals Shah's visions in scatter-shot whip-pans soaked in metallic dark blues & whites,which unveil with a piecing clarity the horrors that Shah is seeing.As Shah begins to undercover the origins of her new set of eyes,Morakhia lights up the title with bursts of vivid reds & yellows,as Shah aims to uncover the truth,at first sight." 
" A fantastic experience.","It would be rather absurd to say that the movie was just good. I fail to recall the last time I saw a flick as commendable as this. I'm no avid bollywood-fan but I can confidently say that once a while, a movie so brilliant as this, comes along and I cannot say no.Flaws are hard to detect. The following are the various complaints I received about the movie :- a) Poor Plot. The movie has a well defined story. It is about a girl, who loses her eyesight at a very tender age. It is about a girl, who must wait for 20 years to get a cornea donor (which, I assure you, is realistic. How many people are you aware of presently, who would be willing to donate their eyes or those of their departed loved ones?) It is about an unfortunate girl who receives the cornea of an extra-ordinary girl, from a distant land, who had the gift of seeing dead people/people about to die. This may, again, sound ridiculous but how many horror movies out there make sense? Even if there was a poor plot, I wouldn't mind it so much since the superb direction more than made up for it. b) Too much Discontinuity. I couldn't disagree more. The movie attempts to reduce two and a half decades to 2 hours, which is not an easy task. It is a thriller.... not a romance flick, nor a cheap sex comedy. It is assumed that the viewer must utilise his/her brains to co-relate one event with another. (The Indian audience is yet to grow more mature when it comes to theater. Why else is Drama so unpopular?) c) Poor acting. One of the reviews I read clearly stated that Urmila's acting gets better with each flick. I too was expecting to be tortured by her horrible screaming, but that (thankfully) didn't quite happen. Though she got annoying at times, her performance was on an overall quite mature and quite commendable. d) Poor copy of Hollywood Flicks. If one tried hard enough, it would be possible to relate every movie that has been released till date with another. Agreed that ''Naina'' has certain elements which closely resemble ''Sixth-Sense'' as others believe, and ''Ghost'' as well as ''The Ring'' if I were to be believed, but every movie resembles another. All ideas out there have been utilised. Now, we can only recreate, reinvent and reproduce.Moving on, the film is for a very mature audience and quite daring attempt. The direction is the best I've seen till date and the effects are astonishing. The show of dead bodies, charred bodies and internal organs may be sickening, but are possibly vital to the plot. There isn't much I could say without spoiling the movie for you, but I'll conclude by stating that the cast is well chosen, the direction is magnificent and the movie seems to be quite free of cons.The background score deserves a special mention since it was very much in sync with the theme of the movie and doubled the pleasure of watching it." 
" An attempt at moving Bollywood horrors to the next level... but not quite successful","So after all the hype... how good is Naina... the movie that's supposed to take Bollywood (The Indian version of Hollywood) Horror to the next level. To set the context, Bollywood horror is known for its 'icky' style -- relying more on ghoulish sets, and mindless plots -- and less on stuff that jolts the gray cells.In the movie, Naina is a girl blinded since birth, who gets the chance of getting eyes from a donor. Jumping to the opportunity, the eyes are operated upon, and the surgery is a success. All seems to be going well - until, that is, she realizes that she can now see dead people!The movie then progresses to give you truckloads heart stopping frames, many of which, though bearing the stamp of typical Bollywood horror flicks, are pulled off well.At times, the plot seems to bear an uncanny resemblance to 'The Sixth Sense'. Also a bit of 'City of Angels' seems to come in. Further, the story line, though it has its strong points, tends to fall back to typical Bollywood type scripts with needless diversions and some overly sentimental spots.All in all, if you're in for a horror movie, and don't mind the Bollywood styling... then this would be a good movie to watch!" 
" Gruesome and ridiculous","It's bad enough for a movie to be a remake of another. It's worse when two movies are remakes of the same flick and are released back-to-back. I'm talking about Nazar and Naina. I prefer the former. Nazar is a more thrilling and entertaining and has good songs. Naina, on the contrary, is quite intense--the type of movie that gives you a headache by the end. There are some repulsive scenes such as the operation. I must say, though, that Naina has better special effects. Although the movie is not too long compared to other Hindi movies, it feels like it goes on forever. Towards the end it becomes a complete drag and the climax is absolutely ridiculous." 
" Non-Hindi Speakers Stay Away","This movie was awful, and a misleading copy of "The Eye." Additionally, it is awful in a way that American remakes of Asian horror films often aren't. At least the Hollywood remakes are typically slick, bigger on budget, and look pretty. Certain scenes may even be improvements upon the original (and certain films like "Pulse" actually beg for a remake, because they are hardly flawless even though they may have a good concept.) But this movie...it had absolutely no redeeming qualities; many scenes were laughable! A smaller-budget remake (copy?) with no original ideas or twists on the story? That means it must have been done simply to change the language to appeal to Hindi-speakers. That's fine, but there's absolutely no reason for anyone who does not speak Hindi to see this...if you are going to read subtitles, watch the much superior original.And I do plan on seeing the American remake of "The Eye," even though I know that it can't be an improvement upon one of my favorite horror films. At least, however, I don't expect it to be the insult that this film is.The bad makeup job and hair cover on the "bald" cancer kid gave me the chills, for all of the wrong reasons."
