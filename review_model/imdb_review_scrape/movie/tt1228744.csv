" Great Movie","Incredible! This is the first word comes in my mind watching this movie. This is one of the best movies from Indian cinema. Its an artistic and brain washing movie. Any one might cry, laugh, scare and feel all the possible human traits and feelings. There is glimpse of international standard theatrical presentation as well Indian. A Wonderful movie by a wonderful team; call it actor, director (I just wanted to mention that I had never heard earlier about the Director of the movie and some star cast) or any one related to this movie by any mean are great and honest in their performance. This movie is like a mirror of our society which touch base almost all the colors of life and society like language, culture, history, contemporary concerns, politics, hunger, reality of Inida and so called Indian growth including most of the positive and negative aspects. This movies stands with some intellectual ones like Salam Bomaby, Midnight cowboy etc. Please don't watch this movie if you really like to watch movies like Golmaal-3 (indian movie) or so. Again don't miss this please, I feel like proud that I watched this. Thanks!"
