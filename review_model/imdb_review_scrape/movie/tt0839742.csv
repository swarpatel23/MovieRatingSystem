Over 500,000 people were exposed to methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas and other chemicals & killing as many as 10,000 people in one night.

" World's largest industrial disaster - after 30 years, the hurt remains, the story is out.","The director Ravi Kumar has created a timeless masterpiece. After 30 years, the facts remain and the story revisited. Bhopal a Prayer for Rain, is not only beautifully written but the filmography delivers the reality of the topic and experiences. Take yourself back 30 years and live the disaster, feel the laughter and the pain. Everyone should be educated and acknowledge by this film because the fact of Bhopal industrial disaster still live in many lives today not only in memories but especially those with physical and mental defects, this film will strike you to your core and bring out your tears, a definitely must see." 
" An accurate portrayal of one of the worst industrial disasters in history.","Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain is a biopic about the Bhopal gas tragedy that occurred on December 2nd, 1984. The movie covers the events leading up to the gas tragedy & the actual tragedy itself. A journalist named Motwani(Kal Penn), wants to expose Union Carbide Corporation for building a chemical industrial plant right in the middle of Bhopal. He takes the help of American journalist Eva Gascon(Mischa Barton), to bring down Union Carbide & its CEO, Warren Anderson(Martin Sheen), before it's too late. The movie also revolves around Dilip(Rajpal Yadav), who works for Union Carbide. Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain is a brilliant film! The first half of the movie is a little dragging. However, the second half of the movie more than makes up for it. The scenes of the film involving the gas leak & its effects are gut wrenching & heart breaking at the same time. I'm glad that director Ravi Kumar did not shy away from showing us what exactly happened on that fateful night. The performances are the highlight of the film. Kal Penn is spectacular as Motwani. Martin Sheen is outstanding as Warren Anderson. Mischa Barton is impressive as Eva Gascon. However, the standout performer of the film is without a doubt, Rajpal Yadav as Dilip. Yadav's character is the heart & soul of the film & can make us experience a whirlwind of emotions. Tannishtha Chatterjee is good as Leela. The supporting characters are great as well. Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain is a must watch." 
" One of the best films I have ever seen","One of the best films I have ever watched. Bhopal wasn't just an industrial disaster; it was a human one. It reflects the failure of design, implementation, and a neglect for the inherent humanity found in all of us. These actors brought this story to life and made it human. Rajpal Yadav shows us as the protagonist the difficult position community members were placed in- likely unaware of the extraordinary risk they were taking in working for Union Carbide. Mischa Barton and Kal Penn reflect what more journalists must stand for - pursuit of the truth. These three actors brought characters to life that show the good in people- and what we are all fighting for. In doing so, they have created an emotionally charged film that forces us all to reflect on what kind of world we want to live in. Bhpoal: A Prayer for Rain is a must watch." 
" Every Indian even every person should watch this one","Watched Bhopal: A Prayer for RainBefore watching I was knowing very little about Bhopal gas tragedy but while watching this movie I felt that my heart was chocked up And even after reading facts about the World's largest industrial disaster I felt very angry one our government and US Government. Really very touching movie and disturbing movie Acting of everyone was simply superb, Specially of Rajpal Yadav. After long time I found him in life long character. Direction was splendid and the hidden meaning behind many scenes was superb. Some of my favorites: 1. In starting child were shown catching flying bug and in ending blind person was trying to catch flying bug. It shows the dangerous effect of gas leak. 2. In Starting and end, Horse was shown running without any rider which means that there is nothing left in Bhopal's life. Even those who were not dead their life is also blank. And many more Every Indian even every person should watch this one." 
" A Haunting Rush To The Past. ♦ 76%","I know better than to wholly trust what I see in a film. But Ravi Kumar's honest and haunting story of what really happened on December 1984 at the heart of India makes my view on the topic clear. The figures may never be accurately exacted, but the magnitude of the tragedy is explicit. Who's to be blamed? The film says what we want to hear.Union Carbide is seen adopting poor working conditions from the beginning even when they were alerted of the disastrous effects of MIC (Methyl Isocyanate), the chemical the plant produced, in 1982. Giving the story a dramatic addition of a family, the film takes you on a gradual fact-finding trip as "pure negligence" is termed as the single, great cause of the whole tragedy. Negligence by everyone involved: the government, the UCC, and partially even the employees. Also, structural changes were made to the plant, and as the Carbide called it Indianization, which triggered the leak. The fact that journalism acted without effect puts us in a state of confusion: whether to believe it or not. Had journalism been paid heed like we do now in 2014, Bhopal Gas Tragedy COULD have easily been averted. Many things together caused the tragedy and the only way to right this wrong was to strictly regulate industrial operations, which is still a debatable topic. The compensation was like a honorarium.The performances by Rajpal Yadav, Martin Sheen & Kal Penn is what drives the film into a suspense thriller. The only sadness we have as an audience is that we can't go back in time and try to delete the incident. A pre-credit montage of the aftermath is the silver lining of the film. It says that Union Carbide never apologized, which is even graver a fact.BOTTOM LINE: One of the many pleasures while watching this historical drama is that Warren Anderson is dead as a dodo. Recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" This is still a hot subject for Dow Chemicals (Union Carbide) in 2012","A great film in every way.....a real must-see.Martin Sheen plays BSing C.E.O. Warren Anderson brilliantly - but for me the start was Rajpal Yadav who played the part of Dilip, the entry-level worker who spent his life in dept, struggled to take responsibility for his poor family and then died trying to take responsibility for the chemical disaster so his family could continue to enjoy the wedding that night.The avoidance of financial compensation was a great finishing "scene".1984 might seem like a long time back... It's three decades since Union Carbide (since taken over by Dow Chemicals) released enough methyl isocyanate into the environment to kill about 12,000 people overnight and leave water in the region 500 times over WHO recommended limits for benzene hexachloride and mercury*. But here is the interesting thing...Dow Chemicals pay spying agency Strategic Forecasting, Inc. to spy on activists who are doing anything constructive such as bring public attention to the problem or helping people directly there on the ground.Just by bring this to your attention, Dow Chemicals have me on their watch-list. A few minutes of your time and a search-engine and you can check this!" 
" A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A scathing attack on crony capitalism and social commentary on India of the 1980s","Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain is a historical drama film directed by Indian filmmaker Ravi Kumar. Co-written by David Brooks and Kumar himself, the movie presents a highly dramatized version of the events that led to the Bhopal disaster, often referred to as the Bhopal gas tragedy, on the night of 2–3 December 1984 at the Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in Bhopal, the capital of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The disaster was caused by the accidental leakage of methyl isocyanate gas and other toxic chemicals which spread around the shanty towns located near the plant, threatening lives of lakhs and killing thousands. The movie stars Martin Sheen, Mischa Barton, Kal Penn, Rajpal Yadav, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Manoj Joshi and Joy Sengupta in the major roles. The movie is produced by Sahara Movie Studios and Rising Star Entertainment and distributed by Revolver Entertainment. The movie is slotted to release on 5 December 2014 in theatres across India.Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain succeeds in capturing brilliantly, through its motley of interesting characters, the chaos that became associated with one of the greatest tragedies in modern history. The movie serves as a powerful social commentary that poignantly depicts the plight of the poor in Third World countries like India during the latter part of the 20th century. These countries generally suffered from lack of industrialization, extremely low per capita incomes, low literacy rates, high population growth, poor health and sanitation facilities, weak transport infrastructure, and overdependence on agriculture and allied activities. "Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain". The movie also launches a scathing attack on crony capitalism—a notorious brand of capitalism prevalent in Asian countries wherein success in business depends on the nexus between opportunistic businessmen and corrupt government officials. Despite going down in the annals of history as one of the major disasters of the 20th century, Bhopal gas tragedy strangely enough hadn't hitherto managed to become the subject of any major motion picture. And, that's precisely what inspired Ravi Kumar to make a movie on the seemingly forbidden subject. Kumar explains: "To my surprise there was little interest from Bollywood or even UK film industry to make a dramatic thriller about a subject with tremendous potential about corporate greed, environment disaster and the spicy mix of politics and multinational giant's profit driven agenda." Kumar got the idea for the movie from Mr. Sanjoy Hazarika's book "Bhopal - Lessons Of A Gas Tragedy," which he had read in 2005. After reading the book, Kumar was bowled over by the thought of a making a major motion picture on the subject. Kumar asserts: "The reason for making this film is not to play the blame game, but learn from history so another tragedy can be avoided. We wanted to make an international feature film with major stars for the world audience who do not know about the tragedy."Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain has come as a great respite at a time when the element of realism is on the wane in Indian cinema at large. The movie serves as a great example of how the power of cinema can be leveraged upon to bring important historical events back to life for the older generations to relive them and for the coming generations to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors. History as a genre is still quite new to the India cinema and a lot needs to be done before it starts getting treated like some of the more conventional genres. The movie is far from being a perfect adaptation of the Bhopal gas tragedy. While the movie captures the essence of the tragedy really well, the narrative, at times, seems to suffer from certain structural flaws. In the act of dramatizing the events so as to make the end product appear more palatable to the masala audiences, the movie, more often than not, appears to be digressing a bit from its central theme.Overall, Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain can best be described as a brutal but honest attempt on the part of its makers to capture on the celluloid the chaos associated with the Bhopal gas tragedy. It's not great cinema but it's definitely thought-provoking. Despite commercial obligations, and, to its credit, the movie doesn't deviate much from propagating the hard facts pertaining to the mishap. As a social commentary on India of the 1980s, the movie packs a powerful punch. On the technical front, there isn't much to complain about: be it cinematography, sound, or editing. The acting is solid all around, thanks to the presence of an international ensemble cast led by the veteran American actor Martin Sheen and renowned Indian actor Rajpal Yadav. Both Sheen and Yadav are excellent in their respective roles, as are Mischa Barton, Kal Penn, and Tannishtha Chatterjee. The movie features some highly graphic sequences towards the end which may repulse the faint-hearted viewers. The movie is meant for serious filmgoers only; the casual viewers are advised to stay away from it. A must watch for those who admire realism in cinema!(This review was originally published in my film blog "A Potpourri of Vestiges")" 
" Pleasantly Surprised!","Last night we went to a free screening of a film titled "Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain" written and directed by Ravi Kumar, whom I expect to become quite a well known name in the next decade or two because this movie demonstrates a natural gift for the art of visual storytelling. I did not expect to like this movie. We went because we were invited by potential investors for my husband's project (Cerebus). It was in San Francisco. I did not know the subject matter of the film until I looked up the title as we drove south on Highway 101. (It was a gorgeous drive through rolling green hills dressed in mist and dusk. I love Napa Valley!) I have to say I was disappointed when I discovered that "A Prayer for Rain" was related to the 1984 poison gas disaster in Bhopal that was caused by Union Carbide, a chemical factory that was built in the middle of nowhere, but after ten years, a community had grown around it. My expectation was a heavy-handed, melodramatic Bollywood type of amateurish first attempt, more on the documentary side, and certainly boring. Of course I felt a little guilty for being so disinterested in the story beneath the tragic headline.I was completely surprised! Ravi Kumar wrote and directed a beautiful movie! Yes, the subject matter was catastrophic and real people by the thousands were killed and tormented by the deceivers who created and managed the plant, nonetheless it was an engaging, good-humored, balanced revelation told in a way that is universal. It is a movie I will recommend to others because it is a good movie. From the editing, soundtrack, direction, casting and performances, it is a world class film. I was more than a little impressed. This film moved, enlightened, and entertained me all at the same time, and that, my friends, is exactly the way it should be when telling a true tale of such importance." 
" Bhopal : Breathing through the gas",""BHOPAL : A Prayer for Rain" is a heart-rending revisit to the most horrific industrial catastrophe in our country that claimed over 10000 lives in December 1984.It forms a precursor to the massive tragedy in the form of connected events that transpired around the infamous Union Carbide plant which spew the lethal MIC gas wiping off almost an entire civilization. Such was the impact that even today, people are born with deformities.Unfolding like a docu-drama providing glimpses of the social milieu,the narrative breathes life with the insertion of certain fictitious and dramatic elements, in the form of a rickshaw puller , Deepak ( Rajpal Yadav)who forms the lifeline of the film.An illiterate who can hardly afford a square meal to his family with an unmarried sister, he finds the new ray of hope in the Carbide plant when he substitutes his friend, a worker out there , after he falls prey into an accidental factory mishap. The plant is a dormant volcano waiting to erupt, a hibernating monster because of the highly risky pesticide production under loose and overlooked safety conditions.Yet many of the workers fail to raise their voice as they have to feed their families at the end of the day.There is a wave of crusade through vigilant journalism by a hard-nosed news reporter, Motwani(Kal Penn) who even seeks the help of another American journo(Mischa Barton) to expose the diplomatic CEO of Carbide,Warren Anderson(Martin Sheen) but all in vain.Ravi Kumar tries to portray the corporate chicanery adopted by Anderson who looked at India as a cheaper proposition, with utmost sincerity.The unflinching look at the bureaucracy and the callousness of our political leaders also flashes at the level of corruption that was rotting our society three decades back.There is a deafening silence towards the finale in the screams of the dying people and the haplessness in the eyes of the local doctor(Manoj Joshi).There are moments of poignancy that leave you numb, but had there been a more solid and polished execution , it would have lingered in our psyche.The film falters with a hurried approach in the ending reels by juxtaposing the tragedy with a wedding proceeding and also for some over- dramatic treatment like the one between Barton and Anderson inside his car.All said and done, Bhopal is a praise-worthy attempt by director Ravi Kumar,also credited fir the film's story, for bringing this tragic incident onto celluloid after almost 5 years of research.The narrative forges a strong emotional connect with its rooted characters,specially Rajpal Yadav and Tannistha Chatterjee who render genuinely moving performances.Yadav blends his innocence, warmth and talent uniformly to bring out the predicament of the impoverished Deepak.Kal Penn, with his outlandish attire,is a character with an arc but doesn't do complete justice to his mixed accent.It is Marteen Sheen who fits into the role of Anderson perfectly,and bringing out the humanistic nuances effectively.Films like Bhopal are a rarity in today's age of massy entertainers.They are highly insightful but do not hold a strong commercial proposition.It is as ironical as the fact that Carbide is not proved fully guilty of the causing this disaster.This one is highly recommended for those with inclination to real-life, meaningful cinema.Rating 3/5" 
" What Happens at a Pesticide Plant when the Workers and Community are Viewed as the Pests?","9 of 10. It's definitely a serious subject, but the characters and actors provide enough levity, affection, and humanity to make it far more than a documentary of tragedy. Based on actual history if not a specific true story, this creates a virtual reality for you to step into and experience what it would have been to live in Bhopal, India with the Union Carbide plant.The story is smoothly told with minimal imposed/artificial melodrama or cliché. It's a film that could have benefited from another 5 minutes to provide more context and follow-up history without resorting to putting it in words on the screen before the end credits roll.It's also a learning experience into the chemicals behind the production of pesticides and how corporations deal with safety issues and operations losing money. Worth seeing in a theater or studying closely from within a classroom." 
" Nice work by all and very good direction",""Bhopal: A prayer for rain" is a true event that happened in Bhopal, a CAPITAL city in MADHYA PRADESH state located in India.This is the second movie regarding this event, only but this one more focused over what this is all about. It may lead you to think, if your neighborhood is safe, if you are in a industrialized area. And if you know something sort of that then you are a educated fool, if the Government is corrupt and the facility is in gross negligence.What's use of that knowledge if you can't do anything when you already know it. In this movie, I think ignorance killed all the people.GENERAL AWARENESS....IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, YOU GET POISONED." 
" A heart-wrenching tragedy.","This documentary drama is about something everyone should know about and make sure the human race should not repeat. What happened 30 years ago should have never happened and it is truly sad this film is based on this true story. Bhopal: A Prayer For Rain is not only a reminder of what happened, but a story we must remember, so we do not repeat it.This film is a documentary, but is also a story and a drama. There is no comedic relief. There is strong messages and lessons to be learned.The story begins when a multinational company, Union Carbide India opens a chemical factory which contains the number one most dangerous chemical to humans in the world. The company responsible for the factory is sadly not making much money and, as a result, they cut their safety regulations. This does not end up as a good idea for, in 1984, the factory had a major leak and the deadly chemical called MIC quickly shot into the air, and into the surrounding air which covered a major town called Bhopal. Thousands die while hundreds of thousands are injured and even today, 30 years later, are still ill. This film truly shows this event well and shows how many people were effected by it and what the company who caused it did to help the victims. Nothing. Warren Anderson (Martin Sheen) not only doesn't help them, but the India court accuses him of mass murder and the "corporate shield" protects him so he is not affected whatsoever. Martin Sheen plays this role with true conviction.This film is an incredibly sad story, I cannot choose a favorite scene. My least favorite is when the accident comes to the attention to Warren for the first time. Anyone would expect that he would be in shock or cry or just try to help them. What he does is blame the workers because he gave them an opportunity and they "ruined it." Then, he flees the country when he sees all the dead bodies and is accused of mass murder. I do not like this scene for I believe he should have at the least go to jail for the rest of his life.This film is very mature so I recommend it for ages 13 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars for they did a wonderful job retelling this horrid event. This film is playing in select theaters now and is available for digital downloads and streaming.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org." 
" Well done, but misses some key parts","The movie is well made. It weaves the larger tragedy very well with the life of a worker in the factory. Thanks to a great script, screenplay, and direction, you can feel the tension increase as things start going wrong in the factory. The impact of the gas leak is also captured very well - it's stark, it seems very real, yet it avoids unnecessary gore. Yet, there are some misses. Some key points of the tragedy are not part of the film at all (though they find mention in text towards the end.) For example, Warren Anderson has a very small role in the film. There was a lot of wrangling over his role and reactions to the tragedy. Then there was the incompetence and corruption in the Indian government, which led to a lot of deaths and resulted in a paltry 470 million settlement. Despite these misses, the movie does a great job at capturing the tragedy that the world forgot." 
" Perfect for basic information about the disaster!","Well, to just start it, Ravi Kumar has done a really good job creating this film to remind of the worst industrial disaster of the world. And it actually generates a feeling of guilt among the watchers of the film of not being able to see the disaster or do anything about the disaster and the lost lives of the innocent people. It reflects how mismanagement led to the disaster, but it fails to show how Warren Anderson was actually responsible for the disaster and why people wanted him, reduce 1 star for that. And it also fails to express how Union Carbide International too had any responsibility for it as well as what happened after the disaster, reduce another star for that, but after all, it's a memory that one would want to forget but at the same time, take it as a role model for all the things we've got here in Bhopal today and feel lucky for them." 
" The dark side of Industrial revolution portrayed well in Bhopal's ill-fated past","A very apt representation of desperate independent India welcoming a
greedy western pesticide conglomerate who's only aim was monopoly over
the pesticide sector in developing India. All this, at the cost of the
health of the people who reside in the vicinity of the city of Bhopal.
Some sleek character representation without any over the top character
portrayals make this a very canny depiction of this infamous event in
modern India. Martin Sheen does a very good job at being a
self-centered yet cunning CEO who wants Union Carbide to prosper even
if its at the cost of the lives of the residents. Kal Penn is on point
in playing the role of the only journalist who is audacious enough to
raise his voice against the misdemeanor the factory was posing on the
people. Rajpal Yadav for me steals the show for picturing a shrewd
illiterate worker who wants to earn the livelihood of his family and
help his sister get married which was troublesome in those days due to
dowry demands. Mischa barton, playing the role of Eva Gascon is an
audacious reporter from the Paris match who comes for some other
trivial reason but is baffled knowing what was going on in the city.
The perception of the authorities has been highlighted well and there
have been subtle references to how the west found the third world
poverty driven countries like India to be a mere supplier of
unqualified masses.With a good score and well executed climax a very
highly recommended movie that gives a good insight on the flaws of
industrial revolution and how it affected the developing nations."
