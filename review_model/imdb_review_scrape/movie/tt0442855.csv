" surprisingly good","Surprisingly good, thats what i'll say, this is a thriller and never loses it's track which is very un-bollywoodish.... the 2 actors - rampal and zayed have performed well, zayed has overacted somewhere..in all, the performance from the lead 2 actors is good. but the actress- amisha, does not live up to the standards set by them. the story starts with amisha found hanging to the death, there are 2 persons in that house - husband rampal, who is blind and zayed... then some interesting twists are involved and the nice thing is that we watch only one story, not many stories merged together, and that is the precise reason, i liked this movie. 7/10" 
" A game of cat and mouse","A blind husband, a dead wife, and a somewhat psychotic ex-boyfriend, all thrown together in a story that I could not help feeling I have seen somewhere before, something not helped by an early scene clearly ripping off "Love Actually". Putting that aside, this was not a bad thriller; unusually for a Bollywood film, I found myself switching allegiances between the two main actors, even feeling pity for the psychotic. With a better script (or better subtitling, perhaps?), removal of the unnecessary dances, and a tenser courtroom scene, this film could have been very good. For me, the best performance was put in by Zayed Khan, I won't say more for fear of giving too much away. I saw this film on a long plane flight, and it entertained me perfectly well." 
" Unbroken Promise","I'm a huge fan of revenge films but this thriller was so intelligent and unpredictable, I don't know that if the movie is original or not but it doe's not matter as long as the film is good. The suspense is so relentless you just don't know who is bad or good and is Rahul (Arjun Rampal) really blind or not. The only good song is Main Ishq Uska and the song Teri Kurti just makes me laugh especially the awful voice of the female singer. I felt really sorry for Karan (Zayed Khan) although his love for Pooja (Amisha Patel) was obsessive and uncontrollable. I don't think Rahul was fair to Karan because he did not actually kill her and Pooja was stupid that she had to commit suicide to prove her point she could've explained in the next morning and Rahul would've understood but the way he took his revenge was so amazing. It simply has to be Satish Kaushik's best film he was a poor director in the 90's when he made rubbish films like Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja & Prem but now he his improving and he is a terrific comic actor." 
" Vaada is interesting","At the beginning of the movie, I thought John Abraham should have acted in place of Zayed because it would have been more exciting. I think the chemistry on screen between Arjun and John would have sizzled. As the movie went on, I realized Zayed was a better choice because John rarely excepts defeat. He is cunning enough to avoid getting into trouble with the law. Plus, the story would have dragged on. Other than that, this movie was well done, although it did remind me of Humraaz a bit. Arjun and Zayed rocked the screen portraying two seemingly similar characters. Amisha too had her share of fire. The only thing that annoys me are her innocent look and her hyperventilating crying. In conclusion, I really recommend this movie for its content and portrayal of the characters. All three went really deep to bring the so called imaginary characters to life. Trust me, this movie keeps going and keeps you wondering. P.S. The songs were really nice too." 
" an amazingly interesting movie","I thought that Vaada was a very different movie with a lot of twists, turns, and interesting plots.The basic plot of the story is that Amisha Patel is found dead, and Arjun Rampal, Amisha's blind husband, and his best friend Zayed Khan who also happens to be Amisha's obsessive ex-boyfriend, are trying to figure out who killed her. Arjun Rampal did very well in his role, and he plays his part nicely as the helpless-looking husband who actually has other shades to him.Zayed Khan was great in his role as the psychotic ex-boyfriend. I think this movie proved that he can do more that just play the "fun loving cool dude". He overacted in some spots, but it didn't go overboard.Amisha Patel wasn't in the film very much because she's found dead in the very beginning, but for what she does do, I thought she wasn't that great.The songs are good. I particularly enjoyed "Mein Ishq Uska" and "Maula".watch it!!" 
" Excellent movie","The one thing that is amazing about the story is that you cant predict what is coming next. the music is good. Zyed is okay. Arjun Rampal is good. Amisha is okay. The movie has a lot new ideas not like the old Indian movie where most things are repeated. thats what make "Vaada" to attract the viewers. the movie satisfies you with your expectation.Zyed was suppose to act like a psycho person. but when he goes to foreign country, he acts like he is a mature guy. the dialogs are not too strong and not too weak. the cop is good. well he has shown that he can be suitable in any roles as he did "Gurun"'s character in "Lagaan". Thats the best I can inform you about the movie." 
" very interesting romance/thriller movie","Teri kurti sexy lagti hai," sings Arjun Rampal to his screen-wife Amisha Patel before he goes blind...and the film goes bust.Wish we could see anything remotely sexy in this sterile thriller about a blind man, his beautiful wife and his closet-psychotic friend, played by Arjun, Amisha and Zayed Khan with all the correct pauses in-between fits of passion.But alas, nothing finally fits in "Vaada". It's like an over-elaborate jigsaw puzzle. Someone evidently read the instruction booklet on whodunits too carefully. So much attention is given to the fine print that the overall framework appears to miss the bus...and the buzz.Dead at the centre, cruelly unproductive at heart, "Vaada" is one of those could've-beens that don't take long to become has-beens. The cruellest blow to the audiences' expectations (no matter how low) is that the thriller, as written by Rumi Jaffrey, has the potential to grip.The narrative just lets it droop...and drip until the basic story tapers into a blow-dried dead-end. Very often in the course of this stiff-and-over-conditioned film you ask yourself if director Satish Kaushik was briefed to make a play on film.If so, the narrative ought to have been free of those frisky flights of fancy into foreign shores for Himesh Reshammiya's can't-get-over-you song sequences.Styled like the Michael Caine-Dyan Canon-Christopher Reeve thriller "Deathtrap", "Vaada" tries to create an aura of upper class languor." 
" Worth a watch","Nice storyline and entertaining and enjoyable to watch this movie so much Excellent screenplay and good editing good direction and brilliant performances Arjun was superb zayed was superb in his first villain role amisha was fine Songs are really good I like main ishq uska and Teri kurti Overall this is my own rating is 8/10" 
" Nothing is truly what is seems!","Wow! I really liked this one and just have to wonder why it flopped! The cast looked great, the script was solid and very well acted.Arjun Rampal plays sexy Rahul, who meets and falls in love with a hot and sexy singer/supermodel named Pooja during a sexy Sufi song (Zindagi Ko...I think) and he makes his intentions known to her that he wishes to marry and this they do. Oh! but before all of this shows up in the film, the movie opens to an intruder walking into Rahul's kitchen to find a body hanging from the ceiling and the body turns out to be that of Pooja who has apparently committed suicide. The intruder, turns out to be Rahul's friend Karan (played by another Uber sexy stud Zayed Khan). Karan slowly alerts his friend Rahul that his wife has died, and Rahul, a blind man finds it hard to believe that the woman who went to sleep right next to him the night before is gone.A police investigation ensues that spurns all sort of dirty secrets and lies, one of which includes the fact that the very psychotic Karan was a former lover of Pooja and may or may not be responsible for her death. Don't miss the hot song 'Teri Kurti Sexy' danced to by Rampal and Patel and very beautifully too. My DVD was a bit taped delayed on the 'Zindagi Ko' Sufi song but it doesn't stop the fact that Ms. Patel totally rocks it, looking smoking in it too. Alok Nath, Sharat Saxena, Veerendra Saxena and Rakesh Bedi all co-star in this dark whodunit dramatic thriller!" 
" Not too exciting","I have to say that Satish Kaushik's first attempt at a thriller wasn't that hot. The story was kind of interesting, but somehow the screenplay just does not manage to engross the audience as a thriller really ought to. Many of the events are predictable (although not all are). Those that are not do not seem to make sense, especially the true reason for Amisha's death, which I won't reveal. Arjun gave a good performance, and Zayed also did very well. He seems to be improving very quickly. Amisha was OK. Songs were OK. I liked Teri Chunri Sexy. It's quite funny. Hopefully with a more powerful and engrossing script, Kaushik will have better luck next time." 
" Fun and Good thriller.","Vaada was a Flop in the box office, but it was entertaining. It tells the story of a Blind man Arjun Rampal, who finds his wife (Amisha Patel) dead. The police are investigating what has happened and they lead to a suspect Zayed Khan. What follows is a series of cat and mouse games among the two stars. I don't think Arjun and Zayed are good actor's at all. After watching this movie, I think this and Yakeen is Arjun's Best Film. Zayed Khan shows of a bit too much, but he does perform a good act in this film. He doesn't copy Shah Rukh Khan's style of an obsessive lover as Shahid Kapoor does. Finally the actress Amisha Patel hasn't got a lot of scenes in the film, but she does appear in flashbacks. Her acting is quite good but unnoticed. Thanks to her sexy dance and amazingly body, that i sure would like to dance with. Who cares about her acting as long as she shakes her curves in the dance sequences. There are many fun and entertaining scenes. This is worth the watch and does have a good twist at the end." 
" Could've been a great film","Sometimes filmmakers spoil the chances of making a good film VAADA by Satish Kaushik is one such film The film starts off as a good thriller but is ruined by bad handling and writing. The film starts off slowly establishing characters through flashbacks even the interval point is superb and the rest of the film becomes a cat and mouse game which is good but gets predictable. Worst are scenes that defy rationale like Zayed landing up at a house to keep ornaments even though he is a prime suspect. Also the courtroom drama isn't riveting But the climax is superb, Arjun meeting Zayed is superbly canedDirection by Satish Kaushik is good in parts but overall not great Music is okay, Vaada Hai is a good song while Udd Jaaye comes at a wrong placeArjun Rampal played a blind man in Aankhen and was criticised those days his films never worked but here he is awesome especially in the second half, one of his best works. Amisha Patel has a short role and she ruins that too by her hamming Zayed Khan makes his role into a cartoon when he shouts He apes SRK badly in scenes where he has to be obsessive Rakesh Bedi is okay, Rajesh Vivek is given a stupid role Alok Nath is typecast."
