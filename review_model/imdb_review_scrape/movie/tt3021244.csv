" Hard-hitting","The movie is high on content. It has a lot to offer in terms of some smashing performances and an important message. If you are looking for a film sans the usual masala and item numbers, Chaarfutiya Chhokare will cater to your craving. The film deals with an important social issue, which we don't usually see on most of the mainstream Bollywood films. Soha Ali performance can rightly be termed as 'apt'. With no overacting, perfect expressions and subtle dialogue delivery, Soha has given a very hard-hitting performance. Seema Biswas (Janaki) who play's Awadhesh's mother, is phenomenal as expected. Music is soulful and earthy. The script is brilliant. Watch this film with a right frame of mind. It shakes you completely."
