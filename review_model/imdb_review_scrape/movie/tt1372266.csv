" good movie,shoul be watched","its a good one,it impacts the life of a kisaan(farmer),their lifestyle and so on.Sohail Khan does a marvellous job as a farmer and a pure punjabi munda(boy).Arbaaz Khan acts as Sohail Khan brother acts as a lawyer.Jackie Shroff acts as their father.What u will like in the plot was the acting of Sohail Khan.As a true Indian he always kept his honour of his father(Jackie Shroff) in the film.Once his father gets slapped by a villager,on receiving the news he just roused and replied perfectly by cutting the hand of the man who slapped him.Though Diya Mirza acting was not much in the film,but her role was amazing."Great Job" ." 
" Brilliant MOVIES - MUST WATCH","When i sat down to watch Kisaan, i didn't expect a lot, but what i got was a very old style movie which takes me back about 10 years. we don't have movies like this any more.Sohail Khan plays a brilliant role this is the best i have ever seen him act. Arbaaz Khan plays his role quite well. Dia Mirza gives the movie a certain look with her beauty. Nauheed Cyrusi, this is the first time i have seen her and she looks very sweet and simple. the songs are also very good.Overall this is a good solid movie which i would suggest to watch if you want to be reminded what kind of movies used to be made back in the days." 
" Well acted for a change (being a Sohail Khan film)","Very well acted film, a tad-bit extra scenes than needed but it carries a strong message about the importance of family and how appearances can be deceiving in one's surroundings. I actually like watching films that deal with issues plaguing the rural areas of India. Fine acting by Sohail Khan (who is usually bad at acting and almost everything else) his brother Arbaaz was excellent, Dia Mirza (needs to stop making a habit of getting 'you know what' in films) Jackie Shroff is his usual force to be reckoned with self and Nauheed Cyrusi continues to hold her own in a world where her flashy contemporaries wouldn't even be caught dead de-glaming as much as she does. It's time people take notice and give her awards." 
" This is a bad movie","Kissan starring the Brothers Khan Arbaaz and Sohail is an old fashioned family melodrama modeled loosely on Manoj Kumar's Upkaar. While that film, which focused on a clash of values between two brothers, one city-educated the other a rustic hand, was relevant and progressive for its times, this one is ultimately a vendetta film based on a similar premise, but with a central conflict that's embarrassingly archaic. Sickle-happy Jigar (played by Sohail) and his city-slick brother Aman (played by Arbaaz) find themselves on opposite sides of the fence when a smarmy businessman tries to divide the family so he can succeed in convincing their father (played by Jackie Shroff) into selling his ancestral land. What follows are a series of silly misunderstandings, one too many blood-soaked fight scenes, too much unintentional humor, and eventually a convenient, all-too-familiar resolution. With a plot that's predictable, and a screenplay as original as an Anu Malik tune, Kissan is an ordeal to sit through because it's reminiscent of those outdated '80s potboilers that you thought you'd seen the last of. Oddly, the film comes with the muddled message that violence is the answer to violence and that education breeds unhealthy ambition. Burning issues like farmers' suicides and oppression by corrupt zamindars are only fleetingly mentioned, never adequately addressed in Kissan which shamelessly describes itself as a tribute to the farmer, and even goes so far as to end with a Daler Mehndi-remix video of the popular Mere desh ki dharti number from Upkaar. Because the acting is uniformly uninspired, and the direction mostly flat, and because this film doesn't even have its heart in the right place.Watch it at your own risk." 
" Outdated","Sohail Khan and Arbaaz Khan been in the industry for sometime yet failed to make a place for themselves and both are still struggling This film is thankfully not the usual nonsense comedy mostly made by Sohail Khan productions or his filmsThe film however is outdated and reminds of old Dilip Kumar and Manoj Kumar type films The treatment is no different and the film ends up being a routine social dramaDirection is ordinary Music is nothing greatJackie gets a meatiest role and does a good job Sohail and Arbaaz are average Dia is ordinary" 
" Useless movie","Absolutely third rate clich√©d story. Nothing great in terms of acting - though it's hard to say whether that is because of the actors' own inadequacies or because of the lackluster and uninspiring plot line. I would say watch this only if there is a gun pointed to your head.There is nothing worth writing about this movie. It's another brick in the great wall of miserable Bollywood movies which have nothing new to add.The theme (plight of farmers) could have been much well dealt with if it were say written by someone with a quarter of a brain or creative talent.Only reason I give it 2 stars is that there are worse movies out there."
