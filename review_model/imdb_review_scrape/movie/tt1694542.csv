" First half was brilliant, can't say same about the second one though!!!","I had no prior intentions of watching this movie on first day first show. Some of my friends were going to watch this, so I joined them. Having just watched a trailer, I set out to watch this film without any expectations. But, to my surprise this movie made me laugh a lot and by the interval most people were out of their seats clapping and laughing. Movie also had a spicy Indian flavor which mixed with great humor made for really some treat. But, soon after interval, it turned out that this was too good to be true. After interval, movie started taking sharp turns some of those were beyond Human understanding. This could have been a wonderful 100 minutes movie. Don't know why directors instead opted for stretching this movie so much so as to make it completely boring and quite predictable too in the end. But, you won't regret your bucks if you see it with your friends for first time. This movie had some awesome beats as well. Punjabi beats were just irresistible not to dance upon them. Do check out OST after watching this movie. Madhawan was awesome as ever. Kangana is a good actress as far as acting is concerned and she didn't disappoint. But, it was difficult to gage the kind of character she played, which turned out to be a bit frustrating. Award for special acting, if any, will go to "Deepak Dobriyal" who in the cast of Pappu delivers an excellent performance. He is the one guy who keeps movie one even in a supporting role. Jimmy Shergil in his guest role is awesome too. His performance was very realistic. Eijaz Khan in the role of Jassi is also quite good. Having said that, this movie could have been a real gem which it wasn't. This is kind of movie you would want to see and then forget. Those not familiar with Indian culture might get disappointed because, Indian flavor is what makes this movie enjoyable. I will rate this movie as an average one. 7 out of 10." 
" A light hearted Rom-com Flick","Guys Tannu weds Mannu is a light hearted Rom-com flick which u can enjoy with Ur family.It has some down moments and some very top standard .The movie is all over nice but not too good.There is nothing fresh but still some scenes can grab Ur attention .The director "Aanand Rai" who directed "Thoda Life Thoda Magic" and "strangers" comes with his new flick.Performances are the top notch part of the movie with its soundtrack,the songs like "Saadi Gali" and "Jugni" are so groovy that gives u a feeling to dance and track like "Yun Hi" is really fantastic and memorable for me,sung by 'Mohit Chouhan'.The Screenplay which is always the backbone of a movie is good but not awesome to grab the audience.Cinematography is worthy to watch.R. Madhvan and Kangana done a great job with this movie and best for me is a Jimmy Shergil,he is in guest appearance nd he is too good.Dialogues are also one of the best part of the movie. The movie is stretched in many parts but still it has some pop up moments,it has great storyline but less messed up climax would have worked wonders for the film.On the whole,Tannu weds mannu is a light family entertainment movie,if u love simple nd uncomplicated flicks than it is going to tug Ur hearts.So go nd watch it.Its a wonderful mismatch." 
" Good music, that's about it. Spoilers","I enjoyed the music very much but hated the storyline. He 'falls in love' with her after seeing her asleep and denies a girl he got to know! The concept of the marriage was very foolish. Bollywood should know better by now and show love marriages. Kangana has talent and she showed how capable she was in this film but she was let down by the crazy plot.A friend would not threaten to kill you if you didn't give him the girl. The girl would not fall out of love and marry the guy who society deems acceptable! This COULD have been a story of true love. The character of Raja should have been cut out and the "arranged" concept left out. They should have been able to fall in love themselves.The music however, is wonderful! Sadi gali has become legendary and is definitely going to be memorable for years to come. Kangana has great potential, please Bollywood get some more realistic and better stories out!" 
" Realistic presentation of an unrealistic story","Last Sunday, just casually I went to watch Tanu Weds Manu with a low expectation. And to my immense surprise, I felt extremely satisfied after watching it. In fact, as the movie progressed, I found myself being lost in the narrative, flowing with the storyline and the characters (mainly with the hero). This low profile movie is based on an unrealistic story of a well-educated (and well-mannered) NRI doctor, falling for a drunkard, smoker, foul-mouthed and philandering girl of a middle class family of Kanpur (it's been told that she had had her education in Delhi). However, it's the utterly realistic portrayal of this unrealistic story on the screen which makes it a winner.As expected, the boy falling for the charms of the girl (whom he sees for the first time in a highly intoxicated state and he thought she was slept), finally wins her over first emotionally and then practically. So the end of the movie is as predictable as any other bollywood movie of the same genre. However, the twists and turns in the story alongwith the highly realistic milieu and the supporting characters involved, turn the experience of watching this movie into a highly satisfying one.At the very outset, it reminds the viewer of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun and later it is reminiscent of Jab We Met and Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge at places. However the commendable thing is that despite similarities in bits and pieces, this movie maintains an identity of its own. It's definitely not a copy of any other movie.The locales of Kanpur, Kapurthala, Lucknow etc. have been captured by the cinematographer with a high degree of excellence for which he deserves an award for sure. The lives of the middle class people (whether they are from the prospective bride's side or the prospective groom's side) have been shown with so much naturalness that the characters and their homes look quite real and nowhere filmi. The middle-class India shown in the movie is, in fact, the real one with real flesh and blood characters that may be found at next door to us.The first half is thoroughly gripping and entertaining whereas despite its shorter length, the second half is a bit dragging and edgy. However, overall the movie render an air of feel-good. We know that the hero will get his love in the end (after all, he is an Indian hero), still the script-writer has done a marvellous job by maintaining the curiosity throughout.After a very long time, I listened to such soul-soothing music in a bollywood movie. So full marks to the music director as well as the lyricist.The supporting characters of the movie are above its story; utterly real, familiar and like a gust of fresh air. Whether it's the chaddi-buddy of the hero or his present best pal, whether it's the closest friend of the heroine or the fathers of the hero-heroine duo, all are able to leave their imprints on the viewers' hearts. In fact, it's the supporting cast which is the heart and the soul of this movie.Jimmi Shergill stands out in the predictable climax and once again proves that he's an actor par excellence. I have been an admirer of R. Madhwan since his Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein days and to me, he played the character of the mature and considerate hero, doing justice to his love at first sight, with perfection. His underplay deserves a standing ovation indeed. Many readers may not agree with me, however I found Kangna Ranaut as miscast in the role of the spoilt girl. Barring the final 15-20 minutes, I found her expressions and gestures as plastic, not emerging from her heart.When Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge had been released, I was a heartbroken boy and not being mature enough, used to think of getting the love of my life in the style of Raj (Shah Rukh Khan). Later on, upon growing up with age only I realized that I could never be so resourceful as the larger than life character of Raj in DDLJ. However I am able to identify with Manu of TWM; the considerate, understanding, well-educated, yet old-fashioned and traditional and above all, sacrificing, true lover." 
" A candy floss cinema for a perfect weekend.","TANU WEDS MANU is a feel good movie with its own pros and flaws.The movie starts off well with a typical start like a rom com movie added a Punjabi funk and flavor to it.The film manages to hook you with its sheer atmospherics.The director creates an extremely busy and colorful canvas brimming with characters who are anything but cardboard cut-outs. If Madhavan fleshes out a heart-tugging, oh-so-lonely and acutely Desi NRI, winning you over with his shy smiles and well-mannered chutzpah, then Kangna Ranaut's wild cat rebel is endearing too.The feel good attitude of the film is what it makes a worth watch.The story by Himashu Sharma is good but nothing new.The factor that keeps you engaged is the unpredictability.Dialogues are catchy and witty at the same time.Good score here.But the screenplay is okay.The editing by Hemal Kothari is lousy.The film could have been tightened post interval.The ups and downs in the rom com could have been elaborated slightly better.Kangna's transformation from wild cat to Susy etches.Cinematography by Chitranjan Das is good.Music is a complete surprise. Debutant Krsna takes a good start here.Background score is good and it complements the movie.Aanand L. Rai after a good start with "Strangers" looks promising here.He has managed well to differentiate an ordinary rom com with this one.TANU WEDS MANU deserves to be a different cinema in its genre due to directions.Minus few Hiccups in story section,the director has managed well the overall flow of the movie." 
" Tanu and Manu's Snoozefest","Having read the synopsis, I became interested in Aanand Rai's 'Tanu Beds Manu'. The film starts amusingly, even though full of clichés. The beep slangs were funny but it would have been funnier if there was no beep but then again the makers wanted to make the movie family friendly I guess. I liked the references it makes to other Hindi films. The interaction between the characters are fun especially in the first half and Manu's initial struggle after being turned down by Tanu and peer and parental pressure are shown amusingly. I also enjoyed the scenes with Kangana Ranaut and Madhavan in this portion of the movie. It's only after the introduction of Raja Awasthi that things rapidly head downhill. From then on it becomes another generic Bollywood love triangle that has been overdone in, well, numerous Bollywood movies. At this point the film drags on and on until the predictable and overstretched ending. Madhavan does a brilliant job as the slightly nerdy goofy Manu. Comedy may not be Kangana's fort but she tries and is quite alright. Jimmy Shergill is wasted. Deepak Dobriyal is excellent. Ravi Kishen is wasted. Overall, this could have been a decently entertaining lighthearted fare all the way if it weren't for the lacklustre second half." 
" Watched 20 times but still want to watch again","Watched 20 times and still there is something which attracts towards this movie. Such movies are hard to find...so do watch. The artistic skills of Manu, Tanu , Payal , Pappi , father of Tanu is tremendous ..... they are simply awesomeSome stuff where some more work could have done was Punjabi language. The dialects spoken by Jassi ( hard core Punjabi groom ) is not that convincing.Jimmy Shergill who himself is better Punjabi should have done the role of Jassi. But true to his name Jimmy has played a great role.Role of Payal is too good,she has long way to go" 
" Not your usual cast of characters","I am not a big fan of Kangna and before watching the movie I was convinced that Kangna will flop at playing the role of a small town girl. However, I must say that Kangna performed very convincingly as Tanu from a small town in UP. Movie had lots of twist and turns but was very convincing up until the end. Madhavan as Munnu Ji was also very likable and convincing. The guy falls in love with a girl at first sight and does things for her even though she is cruel to him. Overall a very good movie that exceeded my expectations. The music of the movie was also very good. Especially like the punjabi songs. My favorite one was kadi sadi gali .. I also liked the rehash of Kajra mohabbat wala. Supporting cast was also strong." 
" Tasteless film making","Bollywood can do well to get some good script writers. This movie is like a test of patience. Its one thing to see a movie and know in the first 10 minutes that it is utter nonsense. This movie however will keep you on the edge - of boredom. You may feel throughout that things will become better and the script might become better - but it just rambles on.The central problem with this movie is that it assumes that you have an IQ which is just higher than that of a rodent. Why else would you be "amazed" by the twists in the "plot". The sad fact is there are no twists and half way through, you will feel like you are dragging your feet through knee deep viscous mud. Bollywood cant stop producing crap like this. Funnily enough the audience here also cant get enough of crap like this." 
" A nice time pass movie","Today i watched Tannu weds Mannu without much expectations from it, but it turned out to be a good time pass movie.First half is really like a roller coaster ride. Lots of humor with some 'beeped slangs'. It was really funny to hear Indian slags from Kangna who is playing a role of a bindass girl.. ;). As the movie move on you create an interest in the story. Unlike most of bollywood movies where you can predict every scene before, this movie is some what different.Second half is comparatively slow and the story calms down with some emotional touch in the movie. Story becomes somehow predictable, but it needs to be that way. They couldn't do much in that.Kangna has shown in couple of her last movie that she can also act a bit. Madhavan is good as always.Overall it is a good time pass movie. Go and watch it if you are bored with you daily routine and want some fun." 
" Pathetic Attempt at Humour","The only reason of rating this 3 is the fabulous songs the movie has. Apart from that this is by far one of the worst mainstream movies to be produced.The plot of the movie is simple, A guy meets a girl falls in love and their story. Its the typical bollywood drama that follows. Kangana plays the louder than life rebel character while Madhvan plays the sweet boy giving everything to the girl.The story is worth 30mins which is dragged to over 2 hours. Just cannot believe that someone can actually make such a bad movie.Avoid at all cost." 
" don't even think of watching it..(if you are not suicidal)","It is one of the movies which makes you understand and appreciate a lot of movies which you earlier thought to be just average. it would have taken exemplary courage to make such a horrible, unwatchable,irritating,pathetic movie. if we look at the plot, it revolves around a Uk based doctor who has come back to India to get married. He falls in love(at first sight) with a cigarette smoking , foul mouthed slut who refuses to marry him. And after lots of meaningless twists and turns finally convince her to abandon her boyfriend and marry him. Now if you ask why i rate this movie 1/10, the reasons are a follows. 1. I failed to understand(or the movie fails to make us understand) why out of all the other girls he chose to fall in love with this slut. 2. kangana ranaut is one of the worst actress in history of bollywood. 3. script is pathetic. 4. a lot of times you end up wondering where is the story going.Overall I would not recommend this movie to anyone . go watch the ceiling instead..it'll be more worthy of your time." 
" Refreshingly different","One thing that Indian cinema is very good at is feel good stories - boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy overcomes obstacles to finally get and marry girl. Its a basic premise that probably forms the basis of 80% of Indian films. That's not to say its a bad thing either - we all need feel good stories to entertain and take us out of our often problematic lives.One thing that Indian cinema is not very good at is finding a new way to present a feel good story. In this regard they are not any worse than Hollywood to be sure but far too many times they simply rehash without even making an effort.Tanu Weds Manu is one of those rare exceptions where some new approach was found and as a result the film ends up being a lot better than you were expecting.Straight out though - why the title? It gives the whole film away, no matter how refreshingly different the journey to the conclusion is. Couldn't they have used a far more intriguing title like simply "Tanu Weds?".From the start, this is not your average retelling of the common story. The whole setup is very different, quite funny, perhaps a little unbelievable but nonetheless a very good setup for a very entertaining film. As the first hour unfolds, it becomes clear that Tanu is a very different female character than we are used to seeing in Indian rom-coms (although I still don't see the need for the smoking). She definitely is one that will do things her way! Great news for film watchers, not perhaps great news for Manu as he tries to marry!Aside from the story, which to be honest does not quite hold out at a high level all the way to the end even as it tries to avoid the clichéd route, this film rests on the performances of the actors. Collectively they do an excellent job. Madhavan is great in a wonderfully understated performance that leaves no doubt as to his feelings, even when buried. Deepak Dobriyal is the spine of the film though as he ends up in just about scene as the devoted side kick: perhaps the role was a tad underwritten but he made the most of it. If anything Kangana Ranaut was the weak link of the cast and it would have been interesting to see what an Anushka Sharma would have done with the role: despite that, Kangana does a fair job and aside from not having the emotional range that the role perhaps needed hardly puts a foot wrong.The direction was just about spot on, the cinematography can hardly be faulted and the use of music and dance to push the story forward was a nice change.It is not often that I watch a film twice back to back but I did with this one. That does make for a refreshing change in Indian film. It's not a mind-blowing experience but as far as Indian rom-coms go, this is well ahead of most of them. A refreshing change and well worth a visit or two." 
" Good Film...","'Tanu Weds Manu', directed by Anand L. Rai, is a Good Film, that offers entertaining moments in the first, as well as the in second hour, and manages to hold your attention. Sure, it's flawed, but it never really loses it's pace, which works on it's advantage.'Tanu Weds Manu' is a Romantic-Comedy, about how two extreme opposites attract. But, like every Love-Story, there are faced by several obstacles, which they face, and eventually get over with.Himanshu Sharma's Writing is First-Rate in the first hour, as it offers some really interesting sequences. But, the writing dips in the second hour, and tends to drag a bit. However, a convincing culmination does the trick. Anand L. Rai directs this Romantic-Comedy ably. Cinematography is perfect. Music by Krsna, is super.Performance-Wise: Both R. Madhavan and Kangna Ranaut shine in their respective parts. Jimmy Shergill is excellent. An Under-Rated Actor! Deepak Dobriyal is lovable. Eijaz Khan supports well. Rajendra Gupta is flawless, as always. Others lend good support.On the whole, A light-entertainer, that can definitely be viewed once." 
" Pathetic characters and movie!","I'm usually a "let's go along with it" type of person, happy to see whatever's on and try to make the best out of the experience. But this movie was just truly pathetic! The movie is so bad that it has prompted me to write my first movie review!The main character, Manu, is a spineless guy with no dignity. The girl first insults and degrades him and he still goes back for more. The girl is abusive and heartless and isn't even portrayed as "in love" with Manu. Rather, she seems interested in being adored and in playing around. He just seems besotted from the start and no analysis or depiction is made of who he is as a person. So not only was I dissatisfied with the behaviour of the characters as "people" but I also didn't feel like much effort went into actually bringing us closer to understanding what makes Manu and Tanu tick. Manu barely even speaks the whole movie! He just stands at all different functions and events and looks sadly down on everything. No character development and I felt like getting up and slapping him, although of course obviously I couldn't. :)This story is also far too similar to the Prem movie between Ranbir and Katrina Kaif." 
" A Good Start But Fails to Carry on","Yet another Flick in the bollywood season of comedy with romance..yeah the movie seems promising in the start but fails to keep up thereafter.the Movie starts with the great Indian middle class arrange marriage version where NRI Dr.Ma(madhvan)comes to India for choosing girl for his marriage.where he met a unorthodox Tannu (kangna) who doesn't believe in arrange marriage and having all kind of stuffs in life(Smoking,Drinking etc.)soon mannu get notice that she is not at all going to marry him and ask him to say no for marriage.after that they again coincidently met in punjab and things become more complexed.. acting wise the madhavan is good but kangna's character seems bit overdone..though can be seen one time.."
