" A waste of time!","This movie is basically a copy of The Grudge and The Ring. Most of the scenes are taken from these movies, with a bit of bollywood dance masala. The acting performance of most of the characters was bad with an exception of S. Goshal. The story was weak and predictable. Bollywood should set up a censor-board, which filters plagiarised scenes. This movie should have never been released. Bobby Deol should not have taken a role in such a poor script. This is bad on his reputation.The songs were poorly placed in the scenes where they were not needed. In one of the ending scenes, the Ghost screams, and the scream pitch was so high, that I can still feel it my head. It went for almost a minute. Poor and Stupid script. Please keep away from it. 2/10." 
" Notable work","Help is a decent attempt from the director. Even though the movie doesn't have a tight screenplay, is boring at times, but there are certain moments that make your heart beat faster..I watched the movie in my phone, during a late night travel, and it was damn silence all around... The opening scene of Susan drawing weird pictures and killing herself were damn creepy with its BGM. That actress who played Susan has a creepy look, and her eyes and the way she looks towards the camera is creepy and disturbing... There are several other moments also, which makes a kind of uneasiness in the viewers' minds.The movie has Bobby Deol and Mugdha Godse in it, but neither of them has much to perform. Mugdha at least had some dual scenes, and some stone-expression scenes, but Bobby Deol had nothing to do, he just had to support the flow of the story. Shreyas Talpade also appears in 6-7 scenes, he also has nothing much to perform.The movie actually belongs to the BGM director and the Re-recordist. If at all the movie makes some impact in our mind, it is because of the creepy sounds factor. Ah, Jyoti Dogra who played as Susan deserves special remark, for her creepy looks.The movie partly inspires from 'Mirrors' in few sequences, especially towards the climax.The movie lacked clarity in some points, but the flashback scenes were beautifully directed.There are three songs composed by Ashu, the song 'Kehna Hai' is awesome!!! The other two tracks are below average...On the whole, an OK- OK kind of movie." 
" Yet another copy of English movie!!!!","The concept of this film has been taken from the Hollywood film "the unborn". Even some shots had been copied from the movies like "Mirrors" & "Grudge". If you are watching this film without seeing these Hollywood once definitely you will appreciate some of the so called creative & imaginative ideas of the director. The start is OK but as the movie progress its give an ideal example of weak & lethargic script. Bobby Deol was not up to his potentials & now it is very difficult to understand why he is doing such awful selections. The only thing which differentiate this horrific horror film from the English once are songs, which no one would like to sing. Mugdha was OK, trying to boost herself through unattractive body show in one of the song, but unfortunately it did not work. you may avoid this." 
" Simply made as per the fixed rules of horror genre in India.","After watching this latest horror flick from Bollywood most of the viewers would like to ask that why such films are still made without anything new or even interesting to offer to the audience? The answer to this simple question is that though not clearly visible, but there still exists a decent market for horror films in our country, (particularly in many smaller centers) where people even today love watching new horror movies made on the similar pattern started by the famous Ramsay Brothers. Moreover, there is a big and constant demand of horror movies in the home video circuit too which enables such projects to cover their costs and break-even.The basic structure of horror films in our region normally remains the same, where a spirit or an aatma is in search of her revenge from the people related to her and then makes their life miserable with her own cult powers. A savior always enters the script as a Tantrik, College Professor or any other learned person who helps the family to get free from the evil clutches of the spirit and then the climax leaves you with something giving a hint of a sequel in store.HELP also walks on the similar pattern with one new and interesting twist in the story written around the actual identity of the spirit. But sadly this novelty remains the only merit of the movie as the rest of its content is neither able to scare you nor it keeps you glued to your seats out of fear. Though it starts off with a promising sequence which forces you to be attentive, but then the promise remains unfulfilled in the later reels and the movie ends without making any kind of impact on the viewer. The climax also leaves many unanswered questions in the mind like what was the relationship between the spirit and the mirrors in which she is trapped in the end and from where did Bobby Deol learn all those rituals to trap her, when the actual knowledgeable professor had died.Director Rajeev Mirani does come up with some well shot sequences in between, but along with his writers and cinematographer the influence of western cinema is clearly visible in his shots. For instance the twin sisters angle reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece "THE SHINING" (1980) and the Climax dealing with mirrors indicated its inspiration derived from "MIRRORS" (2008). The songs are just there as a mandatory clause, otherwise they were not even required in the narration and the background score serves the purpose fine. Out of the lead pair, Mughda shows huge improvement from all her previous acts and plays it well as the possessed girl. Bobby Deol, as her husband, once again tries hard to put up a good performance. Here I have to say that Bobby is a fine example of how a career can get adversely affected due to some wrong choices of projects at the right time. Shreyas Talpade in a special appearance as the psychic professor is adequate and Jyoti Dogra as the mother is impressive.Overall, HELP is simply made as per the fixed rules of the horror genre in India. Hence, even if you are die-hard fan of the genre you can still easily wait for its Home Video release in the coming weeks.However, the film and its twist in the tale gave me a brilliant thought to frighten the obsessed families who without giving it a second thought, right away decide to kill the girl child in their women's womb. So, next time anyone decides to do so, he should be ready to meet the spirit of the unborn girl child soon.(Note : As informed, this is not the first movie to come up with the novel idea about the revenge of an unborn girl child. The idea was first adopted by another horror movie released in 2007 with the title "GAURI : THE UNBORN" featuring Atul Kulkarni, Rituparna Sengupta and Anupam Kher)" 
" Bollywood's ode to Japanese horror","Bollywood has certainly jumped in leaps-and-bounds in horror genre, that what you would think if you haven't seen any of the Japanese horror films lately. Nonetheless, "Help" is a good watch which will certainly make you jump out of seats on a couple of occasions. Horror genre certainly has started incorporating the suspense element which keeps the audience guessing until the last moment. Bobby Deol was okay'ish. I did not fathom why was he a director of horror movies as it did not connect with the actual plot. Mughda Godse gets a lion's share in terms of the storyline. Again there wasn't any great shakes about it. Her choice of costumes to match the character she was playing was out of sync. Shreyas Talpade had an extended special appearance. Songs were unwarranted. The director as said earlier is heavily inspired by the Japanese horror movies and he has cleverly incorporated into his outing. He has done a good job nonetheless. Technically the movie scores, no doubts."
