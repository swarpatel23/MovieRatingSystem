" Where is the horror element?","RGV and producer Azam Khan had promised a reward of 5 lacs to anyone who sees the movie alone in the theater. I wonder how can someone live in such a big misconception. Did they not watch the movie themselves? It is a below average movie where you feel like laughing in the first half at the strange camera angles and sounds and ear-piercing laughter Ramu used in a failed attempt to induce horror. And I had thought this is not from the factory, therefore RGV would have directed it well.The clichéd demonic possession, exorcism, and black magic remind you of Bhoot and Exorcist. The only good part was the kid Ahsaas Chhanna's acting." 
" Ramu has lost it!!","I think Ramu has lost his charm now. I don't remember when he delivered his last good film. After SarkarRaj and Contract , I was under the impression that he will learn from his mistakes but this film disappointed me badly.The film is based on Black magic unlike Bhoot which revolved around spirit possessing main protagonist's body. Turn offs: 1) Weired Camera angles 2) Overacting by some of the actors (specially Aswin Kalsker and Zakir Hussien) 3) No concrete storyline 4) poor background scoreAll in all , The film fails in creating the atmosphere required for such a genre.However there are some good acting also by main protagonist(Sudeep). One question is still bothering me about the movie. What was the role of that Crow which is shown in movie from time to time?" 
" Ram Gopal Verma - The Manoj Shyamalan of Bollywood","Its a proved fact now that there is only one person in Indian Cinema who can give you much better "Horror movies" than the "Ramsay" kind of cinema made some decades back. Gone are the days when "Horror" meant just Ugly Faces & some Skin show incorporated deliberately. At present viewers are more interested in seeing genuine Horror movies based on original themes. Here RGV comes back with a topic he is best at other than his underworld plot.More than 15 years ago, when I saw "Raat", I felt relieved that at least one person is there in Bollywood who knows his work and also understands the "Horror" genre. But then RGV took long time to make his second in the series, "Bhoot". And now he is back with same kind of sparks in "Phoonk". Though "Phoonk" is quite repetitive in treatment but it works due to its novel subject of "Black Magic" and brilliant performances from a new lead pair.The movie has its moments to enjoy, but you may also feel less supplied to you in respect to info about the subject. The explanatory factor is missing in the script and it only stresses at showing the results of the Magic Spell on the victim. The climax where in a "Learned Person" comes to rescue the family is same as you have seen earlier in "Raat" & "Bhoot".In "Raat" there was Om Puri, Rekha played the role in "Bhoot" and there is "Zakhir Hussain" in "Phoonk" giving the top most performance of his career. He plays the role of a crippled Tantrik and he has acted superbly. Not once the viewer can think that he is acting as he looks so real in his get up and act. Thats the reason he is seen in almost all RGV films and its time others in the industry also use this talented artist more often.The lead pair, Sudeep & Amruta Khanvilkar both impress with their top rate performances. Sudeep is surely a great discovery. He has some resemblance to Javed Jaffery but has acted like an experienced performer. Baby Ahsaas Channa makes an impact as the main sufferer. Ashwini Kalsekar as the culprit manages to give you shocks but also crosses the border in certain scenes. The actress playing Sudeep's mother gives the required mystic touch to the movie. The project is a collective & commendable effort by the whole team.One observation, I would sadly like to mention here. I think Indian Audiences come to see "Horror Movies" in the theater not to enjoy the theme and subject, but only to scream and shout intentionally. Moreover during the whole movie you can hear laughters and giggles in the cinema. May be this is another way of enjoying a "Horror Flick", but certainly not as it should be. I hope the subject of Horror needs a silent and intense watch and I fear "Horror" is not taken as another form of "Comedy" by our dear viewers.Though you may feel similarities with RGVs earlier flicks at times but still the movie is worth a watch if you love this genre of cinema." 
" Rgv ..Please take a break and give us one as well.....","In an interview given to one of the reporters, Mr. Verma, the director of the movie "Phoonk" had warned that the film would scare the hell out of the audiences and said that it would give one sleepless nights.Now, let me put this straight, after I had watched phoonk, I can come to the absolute conclusion that Mr. Ram gopal verma is losing his way out there completely. The situation is not far when people will start ridiculing him at every launch or premiere of a movie of the horror genre.I mean, what is he doing?.Does he ever come to know what the audiences think about his horror films produced or directed by him and what the audiences actually want?.People go inside the hall and literally make fun of the characters and the movie.What chill and what thrill is he talking about? His thoughts and assumptions are going in the wrong direction.he expects us to be afraid..well we are not but instead embarrassed.Talking about phoonk, the movie was a poor one.The storyline had nothing special and exciting.The usage of background music was pathetic according to the film sequences. The film had the typical Ram Gopal Verma elements of the typical ghostly faces and sounds and also the boring creepy atmosphere that was created. The movie had the same lame and boring atmospheric elements as that of Vaastu Shastra, Bhoot, Darna Zaroori Hai and Raat. Audiences can just whistle and tease and take the interest away during the movie.The cinematography with the camera-work was awful and disgusting.RGv wants to scare us but he needs to find new ways.Gone are the days of Raat and other ghost films like Dayyam in which he had some success.He really needs to look up to some Hollywood or Japanese movies and get some inspiration from them if he can't deliver it on his own and there is nothing wrong in it.Every good director gets inspired by Hollywood films and does copy the style because in the end what matters is the audience entertainment. If not watch Hollywood movies then read some good books or Ghost stories by some very famous authors and make a movie on that but not this. The performances given by the actors couldn't really help the story and the direction and instead made things worse. There comes a time when one begins to feel embarrassed after spending even only 30 bucks for the show after the taunts in the hall.The child artists cannot be blamed as direction was poor. The story didn't have much to really set a chilling effect.Faces made along with sounds were just boring.Mr Verma ..wake up...Do make Horror movies.. We need them but change the style. The horror genre of films are soon starting to disappear from the Indian Film Industry.We need quality stuff and if movies like phoonk and vaastu are made time and time again then we can all really stop going to movie theaters." 
" Fantastic and unique","I cant believe some people are saying this film was poor, well i guess some people have shite taste. This movie is a little predictable fair enough, but if you are a expert like myself then 90% of movies are predictable. Thats not the point, the point is this film is a little different from other horror movies. It seems like a ghost has possessed the little girl in the film, but you later find out its something else. The subject in this movie is something rarely seen in movies and that is black magic. I personally know consequences of black magic and have seen how dangerous and evil it is. Black magic is no surprise in some parts of asia and many parts of Africa. Most Nigerian African movies are about black magic. Maybe some people don't believe in it, but this film portrays it beautifully. Superb acting and Excellent direction. Great movie for people with good taste." 
" Average movie","After seeing the trailers, I was expecting much more than what I actually saw. The story line was pretty predictable and that is something you would never expect from a decent horror movie. The actors were good considering most of them were newcomers, but they would have done better with a good story line. Overall an average movie. I would rate Darna Mana Hai and Bhoot higher than Phoonk. It's sad to see that we don't see any decent horror movies in Bollywood and they tend to mess up the ones which they try to remake from a decent Hollywood movie. Though horror movies do appeal to Indian audiences, I feel they get disappointed every time they watch a Bollywood horror movie" 
" Few Words about Phoonk","Its not so scary. A lot of hype was given to this movie because of the contest in which the participant had to view the movie alone in the theater. A strictly one time watch on a DVD.I'm not going to go much into the story as it is simply about a non- believer being haunted by the supernatural and his family.Performances are good. Background Score, Visuals, camera angles etc were supposed to play a major role in a movie which was made to scare the audience. However, all of these were strictly OK.Some Facts Related to the Movie: There was even another contest where participants were supposed to submit their real life experience horror story. This was all on the Phoonk website www.phoonk.in which is now non-existent. However the sad thing about the second contest was that the winners were intimidated over the email but never announced on the website and were also officially never given the price money. I'm one of them.All in all a one time watch movie which doesn't completely fail to impress as a horror movie." 
" Worst movie ever. ...totally disappointing !!!!","I saw this movie and it seems completely absurd. Some concept taken from Hollywood movie exorcist, while main concept being a girl is under spell of black magic. And finally at the end of movie, Indian black magic women becomes some mutant from Hollywood movie X-men, throwing peoples in air by powers of her hand. This whole concept appears to be ridiculously crazy. To any horror movie fans, an advice, just completely avoid this movie.Even in this modern age, renowned directors like this one makes movies that what we all consider superstitious and that only old and illiterate peoples in India believe. To make it worse, this movie gives justification in stupid way as to why we should believe in "Kaala Jadu" Black Magic. Although, I believe Black magic in scientific way, but this doesn't means all the rubbish beliefs among illiterates have some basis. In one shot the main actor is talking to a guy who cures peoples suffering from possession, He tell him "I don't believe in God" to which that guy gives a weird explanation as to why we should believe in black magic. He starts by telling him if he takes some medicine for headache,why does he believe in that headache pill.For this question our main actor has no answer. I was in complete disbelief while watching this as to how low this movie can go down further." 
" Disappointing","I don't know whether it is actually directed by RGV. It lacks the power of a RGV movie.Event though it is not a complete copy of any other movie, some scenes will remind you the Hollywood movies 'The Exorcist' and 'The Fourth kind'. The emotional scenes are a little boring. The basic story idea is good but, they failed in elaborating it properly.Thank God, there is no ghosts in funny make ups like in typical Indian horror movies. It follows the path of J/K horror movies and the appreciation goes to the director. We must also appreciate for selecting a plot like 'black magic' which can be rarely seen in contemporary horror movies . And he also won in telling it in a purely Indian way." 
" A Mediocre Experience","The movie is reasonably good in Indian standards, with a few of blushes, which Shri RGV, as he is known and portrayed, was expected to be eradicated.For an atheist hero, not to believe in supernatural forces even when his daughter defied gravity is beyond pardon, a blush on sensibility.The fate of the ghost buster Zakir Hussain at the end of the movie is equally left unanswered and thus obnoxious.The central characters blended well with the movie but the maid was expected to react better and so was the driver who was famous before as young Amitabh Bachchan, the Indian icon, in Agnipath shouting "maine jaala diya" (i burned it all), as did Seema Biswas in RGV's Bhooth. The Witch and the Witchdoctor were the best of the lot and they played the role of their lifetime. The spookiness was mostly in aggravated background score, which hummed more than it really scared.Considering its a RGV production, I rated it 6, as he was expected to fare better.I went for a Sarkar and came back with something in between Aag and Darna Maana Hai.Sorry RGV, you ought to be more careful next time in hiring right people for editing notes, before heading for it." 
" nice camera work and background score","The great debate between science and superstition continues, but RGV's new film PHOONK tilts in favour of superstition. Surprising, isn't it? The makers of the film had organized a contest. You'd be given a handsome reward if you've the courage to watch PHOONK all alone in a theatre, we're told. Honestly speaking, PHOONK isn't scary by any standards, but as a subject, it works big time because somewhere deep within us, we've heard of the power of the unknown.Whether you're superstitious or not, you may've heard tales/experiences concerning jaadu tona. And you're all eyes and ears the moment someone comes up with an alibi.Write your own movie review of Phoonk PHOONK is easily amongst RGV's finest works (although BHOOTH was scarier) and it holds your attention all through. As a viewer, you're keen to know how RGV would culminate this story. The culmination, of course, would meet with extreme reactions. Some would rubbish it, but the believers might endorse the finale. In my individualistic opinion, it's outstanding! All said, PHOONK is a fantastic experience. The subject -- black magic -- is its biggest star and that alone would ensure House Full boards outside plexes/cinemas.Rajeev (Sudeep), a successful construction engineer, with a loving wife and two children, is an atheist to the core. He scowls at people who believe in the dark forces, till one day when an evil is let loose in his happy home, which threatens to destroy his family and shake up the very foundations of his convictions and beliefs.Thanks to the hype and curiosity generated around the movie, you expect to be scared from Scene 1 itself. And RGV emphasises on lighting and artefacts, besides an eccentric woman (Ashwini Kalsekar), to create the right atmosphere.Of course, you do get the jhatkas in a scene or two, but you don't clasp your hands tightly even once, nor does your heart goes dhak-dhak at a lightening speed. Gradually, RGV plays with the camera (excellent camera-work by Savita Singh) and sound (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani) to heighten the impact. Like all RGV films, the camera angles bear the unmistakable RGV stamp, while the background score (Bapi-Tutul) takes an ordinary scene to the next level.RGV is back with a bang. There's a certain consistency from start to end and this time, he gets the right subject to prove his detractors wrong. Every sequence bears the stamp of a genius that RGV is, hits and flops notwithstanding.The performances are uniformly good. Sudeep impresses you with an excellent performance. Amruta Khanvilkar is efficient. Baby Ahsaas Channa makes a strong impression. Ashwini Kalsekar is top notch. Zakir Hussain's tantric act is superb. Ganesh Yadav lends good support. K.K. Raina and Lilette Dubey, both doctors, are competent. Kenny Desai, Anu Ansari and the actress enacting the role of Sudeep's mother are perfect.On the whole, PHOONK is a fascinating cinematic experience on a subject that's rarely tackled by the dream merchants in Bollywood: Black magic. The subject itself is the biggest star of the film, which would ensure a flying start at the box-office and in turn, prove a jackpot for its producers who've distributed the film themselves.(review written by taran adarsh)" 
" § Glorified Zee Horror Show §","There seems to be only two genres which are penchant to RGV, underworld and horror. He redeems himself with an "underworld" outing for every mistake he commits in an "horror".§ Sudeep:: The new protégé'. Quite promising – bears shades of Manoj Bajpai.§ Amruta Khanvilkar:: From Zee Cinestars Ki Khoj to RGV camp, she has come a long way.§ Ashish Channa:: The kids are watching too much horror programs and it clearly shows.§ Ashwini Kalsekar:: Scary portrayal but at times over the top (and a bit amusing in few scenes!). Same for the actor who played her husband.§ The lady who played the Mother's part was quite natural .§ Lillette Dubey & KK Raina:: Characterization was a bit skewed, inadequately fleshed out.§ Zakir Hussain:: The star performer and carries his role quite effectively.Background score is not too loud – thankfully.The movie bears RGV stamp all over and the weird camera angles come as a part of the package.Raat, Bhoot, Darling, Vaastushastra & the Darna series - reminds me of the story of the spider who refuses to give up. RGV is enamoured by Alfred Hitchcock/ Stanley Kubrick who merely used narration and background score as tools to play with the minds of the audience and create a horror sans blood and gore . Phoonk is yet another attempt to set a similar benchmark on the home ground.What are you waiting for? Bring on Shabri too..... we have the gut to digest that as well."
