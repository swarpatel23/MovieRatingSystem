" A confused mishmash of formulae","From the time that the credits roll on to the screen (Thanks to Shahenshah Amitabh, Superstar Rajnikanth and hugs to Sanjay Dutt & Priyanka Chopra), one gets the feeling that the movie is an indulgence in the exercise of 'I scratch your back and you scratch mine' and not the self proclaimed revolution in Hindi film making.It is a confused mishmash of the same formulae that have been used in the Hindi film industry for all these years with some early 90s style Hollywood special effects thrown in. Somebody needs to tell the director Anubhav Sinha and the producer/actor Shah Rukh Khan that one cannot and should not try to please all the people in the audience, else the end result is exactly what they served: a movie that feels forced and staleStory: By now, all who are remotely interested in this movie know about the story. It is the weakest link in the entire setup. The entire writer's union (even SRK has been credited with contributing to something that amounts to nothing) couldn't decide whether this needs to be a sci-fi, superhero, romance, children or an action flick. Some of the outstanding moments (scenes where I nearly stood outside the theater)are: 1. A press conference at the start where the audience is dumb as it believes the crap that Ms. Reddy dishes out about technology 2. The moment when the antagonist steps out of the game - no explanation on how the game developed an intelligence on its own or how it could move into the physical world in a suit that obviously does not have even a millionth of the processing power or storage capacity needed for such a complicated being to function 3. The superhero's entry - again, no idea how it came into being in the physical world. And how the hell did Ms. Reddy (who seems more like a marketing executive) figure out what the lead game designer / team leader SRK could not4. How was Kareena able to keep her husband's death a secret from the neighbours in India? These days when even a burp is reported on the Facebook and/or Tweeted around the world, it seems highly unlikely5. Why the hell did the robot have to run along the side of the train when running on the top would have been the fastest way to the motorman's cabin?Frankly, the entire story leaves a lot to be desiredInfluences: 1. Poster inspired from Batman Begins 2. The story inspired from Judgement Day (robot saves mother and son from another robot), The Last Action Hero (characters from imaginary world stepping out into the real world), Tron (gaming world characters vs real world characters), Kalicharan (father dies, someone replaces him to protect family), Iron Man (the concept of H.A.R.T. is the same as the arc reactor), Millennium Man (a robot learning about emotions) 3. Scenes inspired from Spiderman series, Batman series, Terminator series, Iron Man series, Rajni's Robot, whew 4. The best moment in the film for me was when the film's shooting was at the factory featured on Pink Floyd's Animals'cover. The only issue is it didn't look half as beautifulActing: the less said the betterOverall: Watch at your own riskSRK may have recovered his investment but he has to remember that he may fool some of the people all the time, all the people some of the time, but he can't fool all the people all the time with his over-the-top marketing gimmicksP.S. the much vaunted Rajnikanth special appearance seems like its airbrushed on to the reel" 
" A super-crap movie that should be a super-flop but may be a super hit","SRK is a genius. At conman ship! He's single-handedly taken a mega-crap garbage of a movie and turned into a must-see event. Now if that isn't genius what is? I think he said no to Shankar and yes to Anubhav Sinha is simply because he couldn't control Shankar but would be able to control Anubhav Sinha. A talentless soul who's only made sub-par crap reaching rock bottom in crappiness by making Cash. And flop-master Anubhav jumped up with joy and couldn't believe his luck that he was getting a 150 crore budget and India's biggest superstar after the disaster like Cash. It's just an example that God doesn't condemn anyone.The movie or the pathetic example of a grotesque cinematic experience :-1. G.One. The video game character actually smiles, sings and dances. Stupidity.2. Ra.One. The villain doesn't want to dominate the world. He just wants to kill a silly annoying kid. Did the makers stop to think that the audience would actually support the villain on this one?3. No explanation for anything. If it's SRK kuch bhi chalta hain.4. Action scenes look they are directed by someone else. Not a good sign for Mr.Sinha. If only the rest of the movie had been directed by competent people.5. Bad background score. For e.g. - the intro of G.One. We don't even realize the hero has arrived. Basic superhero movie 101. I guess it's too much to expect from morons.The list could go on and on but I'm just too tired and don't want to relive the experience.But the biggest people to blame are the stupid Indian audience. They'll turn up in droves like marionettes to watch something as bad as this if there's a star. But let quality movies go a begging.Wonder why don't theaters just play slideshows of still pictures of movie stars in theaters. That should be enough.I've nothing against movie stars, but only against talentless people being given the reigns to make movies and the result being presented as something worthwhile.Shame on you Mr.Khan. I really like you and your movies but this one was below the belt. I mean you cheated your fans. Your real fans that is." 
" Tata Nano sold as a Ferrari","At the end of Ra.One I was left wondering how King Khan had a Tata Nano and sold it as a Ferrari! The beauty of the graphics and the density of the screenplay can be compared to the best of the Hollywood movies but Ra.One lacks character.The story begins on a bad note and quickly drops from there to nothingness. SRK is Shekar, a video game designer from Chennai at London; a stereotype South Indian, who speaks bad Tamil and looks hardly the part. Bad acting has ripped this movie in tatters. The first half is a test SRK has prepared for your nerves with such mind numbing comedy. The lines were obvious and scripted lacked any surprise or energy.Kareena manages to look gorgeous but hardly looks like the mother of Armaan Verma who by the way has done a great job.The 'wow' factor of the movie is Arjun Rampal who manages to pull you with his suave and angelic Powers. 'Chamak Challo'; that my friends, is the high light of the entire movie! And everything else is mental rape of common sense for you. SRK is a fantastic producer lavishing on the sets and props but made a disaster of a movie. The King is severely stressed and appears like a half baked cake throughout the movie.My dear SRK; you cannot be Rajnikanth not only because you are not Rajnikant but also because you are King Khan! This movie can be a great marketing case study on how excessive marketing of a damp product can actually set the box office on fire (Arindam Chaudari hope you are listening!) SRK's media prowess is obvious with people calling this the movie of a lifetime. YUCK!! In short Ra.One is a boring science lecture on Artificial Intelligence and also the 150 crore ego boost of a bad actor. If you decide to watch this movie; please leave your brains in the fridge!" 
" Promotional Overdose..!","THE GAG: Ra-One should have been released in the month of April. We could have laughed it off as a 'fools day' gag considering the content, the inflated ticket prices and non-stop TV branding. The average movie goer was fooled left, right and center..!THE PLOT: Shekhar (Shahrukh Khan) is a video game developer who develops a game that has an unassailable villain so as to impress his villain fanatic son Prateek (Aman Verma).THE MISSING PLOT: RA-ONE is the villain 'program prototype' in the game which goes on to assume the body of Arjun Rampal from an advertisement poster, in real life. How the villain character transforms into a real life super villain is beyond the average movie goer. RA-ONE , now transformed, is on a Prateek chasing spree, just because Prateek's good at video games. And remember this was not supposed to be a 'leave your brains at home' kind..!POSITIVE CHARGE: The music needs a mention. It is catchy. The audience love the party dancing. G-ONE (who is the ever predictable counter measure of RA-ONE aka HERO ).NEGATIVE CHARGE: The outcome of the movie is not convincing. SRK is not SFX material. His acting is his strength which lacked limelight.SFX took precedence in some parts. The script of Ra-One has more pot-holes than that on the streets of Bangalore. Kareena (Sonia) and Arjun(RaOne) lack screen space.THE WAY AHEAD: There are no B-SCHOOLS in the world that cannot deny Shahrukh an honorary MBA. With the hype he generated for a 6 month period if not more has proved him an expert marketing tycoon. Will the audience be fooled again come DON-2..?? Time will tell. But surely,next time any form of promotional overdose will not work.SEQUEAL SCENARIO: The movie ends with an invitation for a would be producer of a RA-ONE TWO. But I'am sure as hell that there will not be any sequels for this movie. Remember the 'super hero' audience is 'once bitten twice shy'..!" 
" words cannot describe how bad this movie is","finally a movie that infuriated me enough to write something about it. This is typifies the ..scope creep.. that plagues most big budget Hindi movies. that extra non-sensical musical number with scantily clad Caucasian women, the slow motion muscle flexing muscled Neanderthals in this case since this is 3D lots of breaking glass and running through flying glass. You start with a decent premise and by the time the final cut is done it ends up being am incredibly stupid mishmash of slow motion ads with a few brain dead songs and comedy sketches. Don't even get me started on the tech story in the movie. It's like some 10th class fail science student making stuff up. This is typical for most bollywood movies now. All pomp and show and no substance." 
" 175 Cr Disaster!","Before reading any further please note that unlike Taran Adarsh & many others, I didn't get paid by SRK. If you are a SRK fanatic, read no further.Before intermission, Kareena utters the best dialogue in the entire movie, 'Kya RA.One, Kya G.One! Mujhe kuch samajh nahi aa raha!!'. Well she spoke for everyone in the cinema hall! After all the crazy marketing & hype by SRK, the movie turned out to be DUD! The movie has a weak story, screenplay and was supported by even a weaker performance by most of the cast. 'Twas like watching a daily serial on TV. One can guess what will happen at the end which is like 10,000 episodes from now but still one would watch it everyday just for the heck of it! Well that is how I felt watching Ra.One. Visual EFX: Amazing!! Though you see heavy influences from Video games like Mortal Kombat and movies like Matrix and Terminator, I still see it as the biggest strength of the movie. 3D was alright. Looks like it was hurriedly done. Stunts: RA.One and G.one are like Iron Man, Spider Man and Robots from Real Steal movie all combined into one. Some stunts were good but most weren't. Almost every single action sequence has been lifted from Mortal Kombat. But I was disappointed with the climax fight. A BIG LET DOWN!South India Killed: "Ayyo" is all you get to hear from SRK during the first half of the movie. SRK struggles with his Tamil big time and he is a tamilian in the movie?!?! Whoa! Mixing curd with noodles and taking long coffee breaks is his depiction of a South Indian guy? Great! Chammak Challo - great song but the situation of the song is so wrong. I never knew South Indian women dress the way Kareena & the background dancers have dressed in the song! Well may be in a South Indian adult movie YES :PRajiniKanth - Plays a minuscule role and I don't now why he decided to do it. Horrible wig and make up. I couldn't believe if it was Rajinikant for real. Again the storyline around him is SO WEAK. I seriously don't understand how this movie is a tribute to him. Another marketing gimmick by SRK I guess.Overall: RA.One didn't quite work for me... it wasn't boring but at the same time, there was nothing interesting to keep me glued to my seat either, no nail-biting moments, power packed action sequences.. instead we got a heavy dose of Karan Johar's sentiments, emotions, KKHH, Karwa Chauth etc! I am sure the movie will be fun to watch for kids and SRK would make his money at the box office but I don't wanna torture Any.One by recommending them to watch RA.One" 
" 'RA.one' - A movie with some effects and a lot of stupidity!! JUST DREADFUL WATCH","OK so 26Th RA.One released and although I had decided that there is no way that I'l watch this stupid movie, my friends were bored and they thought we should watch it(we realized later when we started watching that this was the part where we seriously went wrong!). So, anyway, we went and got ourselves some "jubilee" class tickets and started watching this unbelievably crappy movie. The first half started and as it progressed it became, literally, the most boring,stupid and just plain "lame" thing I have ever seen in my life in a movie. SRK plays head of technical department of a gaming company that desperate to come up with a good game release, he has a son who has a really BAD hairdo and likes playing games but hates superheroes and loves villains. SRK is seen struggling with getting attention of his kid who tells SRK that he likes villains and that his father should make a game in which the villain will never lose. Amazingly (I think this is the part where the movie just goes insanely dumb and lame) he creates such a game in ONE DAY and guess what the game characters then come to life out of thin air without any SOUND explanations(yeah!!I know-->WDF!!)!After that every damn stupid thing that happens is predictable and anyways the story is so lame that I don't even want to talk about it cause just thinking about the stupid story pisses me off! Seriously at one point I was so angry, frustrated and irritated I just wanted to rip off my buddy's head who's idea it was to watch this *beep *beep*beep movie. I felt as if I was being punished by the so called 'King khan' for some mistake I didn't do. If you know some people you seriously hate, I would suggest you gift them tickets to 'RA.1'! You'll hear some people say that the effects are good and that "oh no Bollywood movie has done such effects". Well, let me inform everyone who shares this same view that nobody is saying that the effects were bad but what about everything else, Raone has a really predictable and weak storyline and the dialogues and acting is just dump. I dare any normal person to see 3-4 shows of the movie non-stop and LIVE to tell the tale...yeah!! its THAT BAD! Seriously, If you are a die hard fan of SRK and don't really give ANY importance to story OR dialogues OR acting OR editing OR screenplay, go see it today! But in case if you are a NORMAL sane Human Being like me then Do NOT waste your money, I did the mistake and I want everyone to make a better choice of NOT going to this movie. It (mark my words) is a complete waste of your time and money." 
" Ra-One - One of the Worst Movies of the Century","It is with absolute disgust, a sense of shame and eagerness that I write this review. A movie that lacks character, script, story-line and finesse is expected to impress the audience with just one element - A over hyped budget invested into visual effects. Oh by the way, did I also mention it has also copied various themes from Sucker Punch, Iron Man, Terminator and Spider-man? The movie is such a awful mess, it is not worth even a watch even if you life depended on it! I mean where in the world do you get the director making fun of a character you are expected to take seriously. And where the main theme was to keep it dedicated to a family audience, you have so many embarrassing moments which try their best to fall into the category of humor but seriously fall short into making people uneasy in their seats. All in all, superstar SRK post promotional attempts have been to keep a smiling face, employ the services of marketing companies and pay movie critics to praise and compensate for undoubtedly what qualifies as the most shameful and sad attempt by the Indian Cinematic Movement to try to qualify itself as a formidable force in entertainment. I would say, better than watching this movie, is go home and wash the dishes." 
" unwatchable..","There was a SMS joke doing the rounds after this movie released - "Entry to Ra.One is free, but for early exit one has to pay Rs.500/-, That's how Ra.One made all the money!"That SMS I would say sums all of it. Watch at your own risk.Most of the storyline is a hotchpotch of various movies from Hollywood. Including iron man, mr.beans, spidy and so on.Though it was earlier meant for kids, there are vulgar jokes, scenes and dialogues that make it unsuitable for kids.SRK has thrown in all masala thinking of targeting all audience segments, and has therefore been unable to please anyone." 
" 5rs Bar-one chocolate is much better","There are so many bad words and disgusting feeling to write here..... This movie is full of idiotic sequences and good animation only. Lack of sense and an unwilling, impossible truth which is marked as "The different cinema". Movie starts with a game and the child wants his dad to create a super villain for the game.SRK the dad of this kid creates RA-one to cheer his son and apparently creates the hero G-one...Without any clue, RA-one comes out of the game. Question arises "How is it possible that a game character can come out of game screen?" He/it what to call him I don't know because it appears that it is robot but talks like human. Same thing happens to G-one, it loves kareena but I don't know it is robot or he is man? What the hell?. If he smokes, he coughs but if he grabs the "main point", "Ra-One" asks "What are you doing G-one"? Not only this, nut animation of train engine out of damaged CST station is total animated and no feeling of reality. The dialogs are stupidest in the whole world.... SRK acts like a lover boy instead a game character....I fell asleep and asked my friend to wake me up when the movie is over...Bloody hell, nothing good. I f you want to go for special effects, you better go and play games like Bioshock, Tekken 6 and all.Never watch this stupid 3 hours crap..." 
" Point out a single 'Good' thing about this Film and get paid from me.","I seriously don't know what to say about this highly disastrous movie ever made in Indian Cinema. Seriously where are we heading to? Is this a movie we are taking to raise our bars in International Markets. Then its definitely the biggest joke I have ever heard.Liking an actor and Liking a film are two different things. Wish Shahrukh Khan had realized this and made a movie ahead of his caliber but unfortunately it comes nowhere to the work he has done before.Seriously I couldn't understand the reviews giving 4.5 stars to this DUST. *Face-palm*. What makes a good superhero movie? Good VFX and a great story. Sure this one has some limited but good special effects but what about the story man? Where was it? Also a story is required that could bring out all the emotions together. This film evokes only one expression - laughter, poke and fun. A woman's husband gets killed but after one day she is seeing happily with a robot and her son and fighting the goons.A superhero gaming character has to save a fast racing train to death. yet he saves it in the comical way ever seen. The background score of RD Burman's mixture of songs can be heard during his mission of saving lives and it gives us a proper picture that this film is just made to make fun of itself.IF U JUST WANT TO ENTERTAIN...then why do you put so heavy amount of money on special effects just for this? If its all about entertainment then shahrukh could do this without going the superhero way, i am sure that movie would have made much bucks than this waste.Sometimes when a movie is released, we often say don't believe the negativity just go and watch the movie, this time its just the opposite..if you want to go for a good movie than Ra.one is definitely not that one. The first half of the film is somewhat tolerable, But believe me after the interval, You will beg God to finish it as soon as possible. If you don't believe me you can go through the experience yourself." 
" This film should have been a documentary on marketing management!","It takes a lot of courage to put your money and time behind a story and bring it to the screen. But does it? I have seen many a flick in probably every genre (except perhaps horror), but this movie takes the cake for the worst sci-fi movie ever made.The film starts off with a lewd and disgusting imitation of south Indians by Shah Rukh Khan. Not only is his acting (or should I say lack of it) hideous, it is insulting and revolting.This movie is the strongest evidence that people still judge a book by its cover. From the ludicrous display of women as toys for sex, to the abysmal and down right disgusting show of cheap and ill conceived comedy, this movie is a hallmark of errors that needn't be made by film makers.Shah Rukh Khan in his various avatars during this movie shows that all you need to SELL a movie is sex, regionalism, an extremely popular star cast and an international music artist (yeah Akon, I'm talking about you).With a plot that you could summarise in less than ten words, and acting that would make a 1 year old seem a worthy Oscar performer, this movie could not have been more worse.The word disappointing doesn't even begin to show the worth of this movie. It was so bad, I wouldn't even watch a pirated copy.I wish there was a minus rating available here. Alas!" 
" One of SRK's worst movies","Any SRK films comes with huge hype and why not......he has always been associated with good and popular films. So when Ra One was announced I like millions of others were eager to see the movie. Before watching it I had only one apprehension, The director was Anubhav Sinha who had made films like Cash (Memories of my worst film watching experience). But then I thought, its a SRK film and he himself is the producer (his wife Gauri is actually the producer, I should not worry.........With lot of excitement I pre booked my and my family's tickets. Well the The Day came and we went to the theater. 2 and half hours later thanks to Mr. Anubhav Sinha's direction (and script) and Mr Khan over acting and some crude jokes and some cool effects (the only good parts) I was reminded of the memories of Cash.........Just pouring in money and showing special effects doesn't help a film become good. Love Story 2050 had good effects, but the movie? well lets not talk about it. The characterization is half baked, the plot, nothing, the story...... Its a fairy tale in a fairy world, its that bizarre.The rating should be around 3 but since I saw many readers (read SRK blind fans) gave it high rating I have reduced the rating to balance it. Save money, save time, save energy.....save yourself from watching RA One.........." 
" Dishonest film,cheated public with lame publicity !","Shahrukh can't be this wrong ,this is a team effort.Story is fresh but we didn't had time,budget & courage to portray it,because we have to spend our resources on stupid exposing songs ,right ? The amount spent in the publicity could have been used to convince at least few of many illogical points. At least one shouldn't be wrong in basic laws of physics, electro magnetics,transmission etc,forget about robotics(hilarious). I didn't liked Rajnikant's Robo either,but it at least tried to show the underlying technology behind 'chitti' and acting of Rajnikant as a robot convince you at some point. The movie is not even close to any Hollywood sci-fi.Sorry team,making good chase sequences and lucid fights doesn't make it Hollywood standard.Accept it, its a complete desi movie,with regular songs,romance andfights(useless).Even the dialogues are so poor that you end up looking your neighbours and not to forget the unconvincing climax.The EFX team has done a good job.Not the best though.I must say stunt master of this movie need to be applauded.The starting chase sequence and pre-climax train sequences are beyond expectation.I must say this train sequence is better than ROBO.I wonder how almost all multiplexes are playing 90% of their shows.Its total monopoly.With these many shows any movie can get its share within two days. Believe it or not. I'm a big shahrukh fan.I always watch his movies on first day.I went for 'Swadesh' thrice,'Chak-de' twice.Compare to these, this is complete deal breaker.One last point.This is basically a children's movie.It gets clean 'U' certificate,that means no vulgarity and wild actions.But i found few scenes offensive.This may be cool with urban kids but in most part of the country parents will be uncomfortable to watch with their kids.I hope i made my point.Shahrukh Sir, i understand the hard work and efforts behind this project,but it seems to me a personal movie,as if you made this for your son.I guess you will realise soon.Sorry Lord 'Rama',i could have celebrated your victory rather than watching this.You warned us about Raavan before(Ra-One)." 
" Diabolical","Awful, awful, awful! I really don't know where to start??? Let's start with the ridiculous title of the film - Ra.one - Random Access One??? In the film Ra.one is a evil character from a computer game. One of the development team whilst brainstorming says that the name of the 'baddie' is obvious and it's 'staring them in the face'. Written on the White board as a title is Ra.one - Random Access One. Hence the name Ra.One. No, it's way over my head. I have no idea why it's so clear to name the character Random Access one. With great baddies like the Joker, Dr Octopus, Lex Luther, Dr Doom and now we can add Random Access One to the list.....not! The film has no coherent plot to speak of. I think they had a basic premise to work with and just made it up as they went along. Unnecessary crude jokes that are not funny and a very nasty, racist joke about Chinese people. Shah Rukh Khan must be extremely delusional to believe in this plot less, clueless, racist garbage is worthy of his name and time. How can an actor of his stature accept this job. Does he not read the script before hand? Oh yeah there wasn't a script. Utter tripe!" 
" Ra.One: a B grade Sci-fi or worse","This is after a long time I am writing a review for any movie, and its because the movie is so so bad, it warrants a trashing... or worse, everyone behind the movie put into a virtual world N plug removed to end the horror of having to watch such bad piece of cinema ever again.SRK can only make movies that allows him to showcase his mimicry, story, other characters and everything else just goes out of the window. SRK does not understand Sci-fi or art, he should stop releasing movies for the public and just do it for his dumb fans and there should also be a new certification for SRK movies, 'certified crap' a big 'C'.And SRK, please leave sci-fi alone for us, sci-fi fans coz we don't want to see your candy floss nonsense in a sci-fi movie. Please stick to making movies like KKHH or KKKG and please leave the sci-fi genre for people with brains (innovators), its a kind request.For the people reading this, please please take my advise and don't waste your time and money on this dud...Someone should kill the person who wrote the story/screenplay, when did British thugs started talking in Hindi, and when did a Bandra Train started going to CST station. There were a few more but I don't recollect them now. Also Arjun Rampal should take some dialogue lessons, not from SRK for sure...I am really really disappointed with it... please please don't encourage SRK to make a sequel to this torture/ham fest...I am giving it 2 out for 10 for its Sfx... and its 'Condom, Condom' dialogue... ;-) else its just avoidable..."
