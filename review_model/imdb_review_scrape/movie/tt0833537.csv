" Excellent Movie!","This was a wonderful movie! Very true to life depiction of human emotions, frailties, jealousies and insecurities. Never was there any over dramatization or cheesiness so characteristic of Indian movies nowadays, and all actors did a fabulous job. What can I say about Mahima Chaudhary! She looks even more beautiful and voluptuous after all these years, and portrays the role of a tormented lonely housewife with great conviction. Gulshan Grover is great as usual, and Padmini Kolhapurie and Shakti Kapoor do a decent enough job. Vikram Singh looks, and acts like a hybrid of Shah Rukh Khan and Arjun Rampal. The songs and picturization are sumptuous, I was blown away by Mahima's seductive appeal and mature woman sexual charisma in the desert song! She is one of the most versatile, intelligent and fine actors of the Hindi cinema! Kiran Rathod did great too. The message is simple yet eloquent, humans are not perfect, and there are no fairy tale endings in real life. Watch it!"
