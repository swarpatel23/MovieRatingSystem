" My faith has been restored !","I love everything about Indian movies. Even if they sometimes come as unrealistic, but this movie is something different. I've had the misfortune of watching many movies that were either too unrealistic or too westernised which made them lose that special magical Indian touch.This movie had that touch. Kareena proved that she can indeed act without over-acting and the chemistry between her and Shaheed was incredible. Shaheed also proved that he can be taken as a serious actor.I loved the songs and the simplicity of the sets. there were no over-budgeted scenes of Indians living abroad. This movie was all in all Indian in its essence and that's what made it a big hit." 
" So Sweet!","I have grown up watching so many Hindi flicks, which invariably are love stories by the way. However, there is something different about this movie which sets it apart from the usual stuff. It is fresh and young - something which is missing these days. The songs too keep playing in your head long after you've listened to them. In short, it is not a drag.Both Shahid Kapur and Kareena seem to be at their peak in this movie. I don't know how to compare their roles in this movie to ones in their previous flicks, but I must admit that they make a good pair. Kareena's excessively talkative personality matches very nicely with Shahid's reserved character. There are no villains too. It is a pity that Shahid and Kareena will not be starring together in the foreseeable future...Enjoy! (8/10)" 
" Kareena Kapoor is incredible!","I am new to Indian movies. But I think I have just fallen in love with Kareena Kapoor. Honestly, I think this actress is more charismatic than any of the big Hollywood or European names I know right now. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole world will soon know about her. Tell me if you know any American or European actress who can even start to level with her in terms of style and beauty - and most of all - charm. None! Because of her, this movie is one of the most endearing love stories I have ever seen. It just makes you fall in love - what better can you say about a romance? And I am not usually interested in these kinds of movies, plus this is only about the 5th bollywood movie I have ever seen." 
" Lovely, simple and full of life","Imtiaz Ali's Jab We Met is one of the most refreshing love stories made in recent times. It is a very simple, interesting and charming film about a heart-broken and serious guy who meets an extremely vivacious and talkative girl who gradually manages to change his perception of life and love. And then, the story turns over in a rather interesting way. The film works better in the first half, as it is more alluring and funny. It later turns into a mini-drama but still in a natural way with a lot of comedy and fun. The music is great and each song contributes to the film's mood in its own way. The film stars Shahid Kapoor in a greatly restrained and impressive act as Aditya, but it is Kareena Kapoor's film all the way. Her comic timing is top-notch, and she is charming, convincing and full of life as the unforgettable Geet. Later on she also provides some superbly acted dramatic scenes, which she plays with unusual restraint and depth. Jab We Met is a very memorable picture, extremely entertaining and uplifting, and definitely a must-see for those who enjoy pleasant, comic and romantic flicks." 
" Now that's entertainment!","Imtiaz Ali's 'Jab We Met' is cinema at its best! One of the finest Romanctic love stories to come out of Indian Cinema. A simple story told in the most interesting and enjoyable manner. The film's first hour is enjoyable, the second is exactly the same. 'Jab We Met' holds your attention from almost start to end, leaving the viewer completely satisfied. The film was a success at the box office, and has remained to be a fan favorite. Thumbs up! Songs: The sound-track is a brownie point. Tum Se Hi and Mauja Hi Mauja are superb songs.Performances: Kareena Kapoor is outstanding. She got all the awards in the best actress category and she, without a doubt deserved them. Shahid Kapur is fantastic. He's natural from start to end. Pawan Malhotra and Dara Singh are good in supporting role. Samuya Tandon looks cute. Tarun Arora is adequate.On the whole, 'Jab We Met' is a pure example of entertaining cinema. As said before, its one the finest romantic films to come out of Indian Cinema in years." 
" Jab We Met is the BEST!","Jab We Met is definitely one of the best movies I've seen so far. Everything is very nice about this movie, totally perfect.My Reviews: Kareena Kapoor - She really impressed me with this movie. I love how the way she portrayed the lovable & talkative Geet to the sensitive & sad Geet on the second half. She is the life of the movie, no doubt.Shahid Kapoor - We all know that Shahid is a good actor, but in this movie, we saw something different. We are used to see Shahid in chocolate, college stories, but Jab We Met proved that he can do serious roles without any problems.Music: Mauja Hi Mauja would definitely my favorite. They saved the best for the last. Mauja Hi Mauja is the best song for the film. But for some reason, it reminded me of "Macarena" (a popular Spanglish song) and "Simarik" (a famous Turkish song).Story: It's really a very predictable story, but I can say it's refreshing. Why? Most Bollywood movies have heroines that are very "damsel-in-distress" and have no relevance in the story. Jab We Met, on the other hand, has a female for a lead. You can see a woman's pain when she's heartbroken, which I can say is very realistic and I can totally relate to it.Overall, 9/10 is my rating. Good movie, good actors, good story, good music. Very good. :)" 
" As fresh as it can be","If a director has courage and the guts to take an outdated story line and execute it to a perfection that is altogether to a new height; new level, the director seriously has got some talent. If you ask me a good/talented director is all you need to get the best out of everything; be it a story line, situation or performers. Same situation same actors has brought such a new , absolute fresh piece of cinema, which probably would have been another needle in the hack had it been directed by any run of the mill director. The store line is the usual girl meets boy on a journey moving towards their own destinations and eventually fall in love but again the execution is so damn superb and realistic that no situation in the movie looks out of place. The dialogs are sparkling despite being mature. The funny moments are truly funny and emotions look absolute real. U immediately relate to them. Over all the chemistry Imtiaz Ali (who directed soocha na tha) manages to built between the lead characters is stunning, absolute real, natural and believable, I have not seen (and I am sure people would agree) such a sweet and heart warming chemistry in any romantic couple for a loooong time. Music is good as well with 2 absolutely amazing romantic songs........"Tum he se" and "Aaoge jab tum". People specially couples whose heart throb with a universal feeling called love go and watch the movie, you would come out mesmerized by the romantic extravaganza.......trust me." 
" A movie thats much more than a movie","Movies are as much a part of my life as Dal- chawal (rice and pulses) but I can't remember having been as insanely in love with any other bollywood/Hollywood/Tollywood movie as this one and if at all, this love affair has only intensified over the years. That doesn't mean, there haven't been better movies, or the actors in Jab We Met haven't given better performances elsewhere. It only means, somewhere in those 2.5 hours, Jab We Met metamorphoses into something far more substantial than just a movie. On the surface, its a simple story of a guy and a girl but if u dive deep enough, it is a heartwarming assortment of stories, about losing and finding love, about internal and external journeys, about forgetting and rediscovering oneself, about letting go with a smile and above all about finding hope in despair. I won't go into the details of the plot, screenplay, acting,direction or any such technical aspect. You will find plenty of people telling you about that. I can only tell you how i can speak every single dialog, having repeated them a million times in my head, or how I can hum those songs which cheer me every time I feel alone. One little thing though, I can't articulate is how Aditya and Geet stay in my heart permanently and keep telling me once in a while.... "Go listen to your heart, everything will be fine then."" 
" Excellent Movie, Great Plot, direction and songs.","So i basically made an IMDb account just because i wanted to comment on this movie. Its great, a very good mix of business and life (im a business student) and it teaches so much about life. I recommend this movie to everyone. The plot is excellent, a bit predictable just like any Hindi movie , but the way the story goes is great. The humor is great, although some of my friends complained of it being a bit dry, but you need an open mind to enjoy it and look beyond the obvious. The songs are beautiful, has an ending item song which is a great dance mix. Has soft songs (atif aslam style), a punjabi song (bhangra style) and pretty much its a complete movie for everyone. A great Family Movie and A Great Date Movie." 
" One of the best romcoms of the 2000s","2000s, especially the later half, saw emergence of the romcom genre in Bollywood. Towards the end of 2000s, we were almost inundated with many of these to the point that most viewers were tired of it. So when I saw this one a couple of years ago, my expectations were minimal to zero. I watched it while working on computer, something in the background. I did not care to watch it until it came out on DVDs. However, it turned out to be the best romcom I have seen to date. It works primarily because of these three ingredients: - Genuine storyline, quite realistic without going too OTT - Charming and very likable character played by Kareena - Music by Pritam, the recycling king/Bhappi Lahri of the 2000sToo bad Imitiaz Ali could not follow it up with as good a movie. Love Aaj Kal, while pretty good, does not come close to this. I have watched it 3 times since my first viewing. Highly recommend!" 
" Sweet fun","Jab We Met is one of my favorite films! It promises a fresh, clean, and sweet experience.Some flaws is how Kareena Kapoor was behaving in the first few scenes of the movie. I felt like slapping her, but she was playing her part as your typical Punjabi kuri. Thankfully she changed later on.Kareena Kapoor has come a long way as an actress and this is coming from somebody who used to hate her! First she did teeny bopper type roles, but she is now moving to more intelligent, mature roles. This really was the perfect role and I'm very happy for her that she won so many awards because she deserved each and every award. Overall, this is a clean movie I can watch with my family over and over again!" 
" .Imtaz Ali is Hrishikesh Mukherjee of modern times....","Remember Hrishida's movies? We laughed with it, loved it, because he created the characters who we could relate. You look around, these characters are in one of your friends. Imtiaz Ali is in the same league. The characters, the shots, the sets, the train, the bus - we have been there! We have lived them.And he creates a gem incorporating these elements. It is humour in pure form! It will brighten you up, no matter how grumpy you may be feeling! I think this is one of the loveliest movie of the year. Pure, unadulterated fun! The strength of the movie is in its script, and in its characters, esp that of Kreena Kpoor (try saying that, you know what I mean) - yeah - Ms Kapoor is in her elements. She plays the role of sikhni convincingly! The lingo, the body language, the attitude, she is 100%! Kareena Kapoor 2.0 (that's what I call post Chameli) rocks! Every movie, she surprises with histrionics, that is very few in current Bollywood can match! And what a transformation from Omkara's Dolly? That's real actress right there! Shahid Kapoor... mmmm, could improve in the acting dept. If I were to choose, I would choose someone like Shreyas Talpade for this role. Shahid has definitely matured as an actor from his chocolate-boy image, but still leaves something to be desired.In my opinion, the comedy is one of the most difficult of the genres. To execute it well without sounding cheap, or going overboard, or cheesy, is not really easy. Imtiaz Ali, in this case does justice to two most important depts, Writing & Direction! A word about music: Pritam brings a fresh set of music, some of it grows on you after listening few times. Definitely I am not talking of the radio-friendly Mauja Hi Mauja, which is tailor-made for music video channels. Songs like Aao Milo Chalo, Tum Se Hi are real nice pop or soft-rockish tunes. Sandesh Shandilya shares the burden on Aaoge Jab Tum, and Rashid Khan does a fine job on the vocals. On Tum Se Hi, watch out for Ustad Sultan Khan's ever soulful crooning.I still give it a 8/10 because Shahid Kapoor's acting has rooms for improvement, the second half has rooms for editing and making it more compact. But the movie is worth watching just for Kareena Kapoor's acting! Way to go Imtiaz Ali!" 
" 'Jab We Watch' it , we are totally entertained","This is an interesting romantic and funny movie from Imtiaz Ali Khan once again after Socha Na Tha, and it fulfilled my long waiting desires to watch it. Imtiaz is going on in his improvement to produce every time a better movie. And it should inspire all the directors of his genre. The scenes have been mostly shot at outdoor spots like Chandigarh, Kulu, Manali and Shimla, and this entertains us as if we are experiencing ourselves a real tour. Again and again seeing daily studio scenes made the eyes wounded and fed up the mind. And thats why it's a nice pick up at nice time. Although the storyline is not that new with the old movies as a boy meets girl and slowly fall in love but the way Imtiaz presented each and every scenes are worth to watch. From the beginning to the end I personally enjoyed the whole movie, and happy to spend some amount of bucks on it. After Shikhar this is second time in which Shahid has proved that he has all the required potentialities to become a genius actor one day. But I was damn irritated by Kareena's irritating and annoying much chatty and talkative role. But still then, beside this the whole story became a sweet and funny love story. For Shahid's lovers and fans, you must have got something relaxed after watching this unique love story (just like ME!!!)." 
" A Funny Little Film","I was at a Punjabi wedding of one of my dear friends early this week. The folks there danced away the whole 3 days like there is no tomorrow. Lot of Jab We Met brought back all that even before the week ended.There is so much life in some people we meet, they infuse faith back in it for us with their sheer presence. Geet is happy-go-lucky girl living life on her terms. Aditya is at the lowest ebb of his life. They meet and life changes for both of them.Imtiaz Ali knows how to make small, endearing films. His characters are next door, his settings are small towns or cities and his stories are simple. He did it well with Socha Na Tha and Ahista Ahista. He hits bang on again with Jab We Met.The casting is precise. I was pleasantly surprised to see Shahid mature up to his role and Kareena bring alive the lively Punjabi girl that she plays. Both of them then slipped into their role reversals with equal ease. Rest of the cast is equally good. I'd like to see more of Pawan Malhotra. He is a very talented actor but hardly seen around.The background score sets an intriguing tone within minutes of the film starting. But it does not maintain that high standard throughout and averages out. The music, otherwise, has some romantic and bhangra numbers which won't stay on charts for long.Jab We Met is an entertaining romantic comedy. Go and enjoy it." 
" Bollywood at its Best","WARNING - This film grabs hold and two and a half hours can literally fly by!*************************************************** *************************************************** Great romantic musical film with Baby Shah Rukh and Kareena both of which are fabulous leads and dancers.City boy Baby Shah Rukh boards a train to nowhere and ends up sitting in hyper Punjabi Kareena's seat. He is then harassed into helping her sort her life out!The film slowly builds to a wonderful climax.*************************************************** ***************************************************Overall - Mauja Hi Mauja!" 
" BollySpice.com JWM Review by Prathna Tiwari","Jab We Met is without a doubt the finest work of cinema that has hit the screens since Chak De India. Sure it doesn't have a Khan in the titles but it sure as heck has two very talented Kapoors. It is not often that you see a movie that is so real yet so extraordinary. JWM provides this rare moment.Aditya Kashyap (Shahid Kapoor) is the most despondent person that one can encounter - a millionaire with a tumultuous life. Hailing from a broken family and after his father's death, he is running a failing business and the icing - he has just been jilted by the "love of hislife". Geet (Kareena Kapoor), 'Bhatinda's Sikhani' is the curious, playful and annoyingly upbeat and chatty chick. She is returning home to Bhatinda, after her doing her degree in Mumbai, to a very large, loving and protective Punjabi family. The two meet on an unexpectedly when a hopeless Adi is on a train, heading nowhere. Geet's fiery and cheery persona at first annoys Adi to the point of insanity but when he looks much closer he sees that there is a lot to be learnt from Geet. In her nosy yet helpful manner, Geet, stupidly misses her train back to Bhatinda. The blame goes to Adi and thus Geet swears that she will not let him escape until Aditya, himself, drops her home. Geet is going to meet her family before putting her genius plan into action - which is to elope with her non-Sikh boyfriend. The story is not something out of the ordinary. Many such scripts have been subjects of experimentation but not until this film, has a director succeeded in finally capturing the essence of such a love story.JWM stands for everything Indian cinema has long forgotten - simple story lines crafted with an Indian backdrop, soul and essence. It's a refreshing experience to take a journey with characters so Indian and most importantly a journey that's in India, which has decreased with the new flock of 'filmmakers'.The script remains flawless with no 'out there' features. If you had to scrutinise the screenplay, the only flaw would be that the songs, "Aaoge Jab Tum" and "Yeh Ishq Hai" should have had less screen time.Almost every scene has something outstanding about it - from cinematography to dialogue to performances. However if you had to pinpoint scenes then it would be two of Shahid's scenes. The first would be his introductory dialogue scene with Kareena on the train when they first meet and the second, where Shahid meets Kareena after nine months apart.Usually it's the cast and director who receive all the accolades but there are two people who should be applauded for making JWM such a fantastic movie. The first would be Imtiaz Ali, the multi-talented writer-director-screenwriter and second, Aarti Kashyap, the amazing editor. The two managed to make the impossible possible  climax that is not a bore. Usually in such stories climaxes are full of tears, embraces, slow motion shots and prolonged melodramatic dialogues that when the actors finish delivering, audiences are fast asleep. As the story unfolds, one would think that this too will have an extended climax. But it doesn't. It's sweet, simple and you leave the cinema satisfied, if not on a high. NB: Despite being an appropriate climax, it isn't a rushed or a haphazard climax and answers any questions asked.Cinematographer, S Natarajan Subramaniam, needs to be congratulated for creating a movie that is absolutely 'real'. The cinematography is a perfect combination of classy yet realistic. It doesn't look cheap or opulent. Not many movies are so perfectly captured. For JWM this style of cinematography was a necessity, as it worked conjunction with the style of storytelling and characters.And at last we get to the performances. Where to begin? Let's start with the show-stealer - Shahid Kapoor. Saying that he has grown from strength-to-strength is an understatement. The actor simply blows you away. Dialogues delivered flawlessly, expressions that are priceless and with a fresh mature look that is to die for (especially in the 'Mauja Mauja' song sequence). It's hard to believe that such a knock-out performance was delivered by someone who is only 4 yrs old in the film industry. JWM is his best work to date. This is, hopefully, a reflection of what is to come.Kareena Kapoor appears in an unseen persona. Sure, she has been the "crazy" girl in many of her previous films but never has she made transitions between a "crazy" and "normal" girl so beautifully. She just might be the saving grace of Bollywood at a time when there is a shortage of actresses, in the true sense of the word. The only flaw in her performance would be the slight overacting in one or two scene. However, like Shahid, Kareena has also performed one of her most memorable roles to date.To sum up the fabulous film that is JWM, is that would this is a film that needs to be studied by the students of cinema and filmmakers of Bollywood. The movie teaches a valuable lesson which is that you don't need an "out of this world" script in order to make an "out of this world" movie. This one is without a doubt, one of the true gems of Indian cinema."
