" Heavenly","The successful combination of Mahesh Bhatt's production team and Emraan Hashmi have teamed up once again after Awarapan for this drama. The story is about the life of a bookie who becomes a cricket match fixer. Mukesh Bhatt's production house delivers great music and hard-hitting plots.Their latest film Jannat is terrific. The film has a very different story that keeps you interested & entertained right from start to end. Generally I don't have any interest in gambling, betting or cricket match fixing but the story was told in a stylish format, it was about 2 hours 20 minutes and I enjoyed every second of it and there wasn't a single boring or useless scene. I'm glad that there isn't another film about revenge or love because I'm sick of those.The best thing about the movie is that it shows that a person who spends money unwisely has an ability that can make him rich which cannot happen in real life. It also shows that you shouldn't push your luck and money can only be earned by hard work. The music is great as usual from the Bhatt's production house and the best songs are Zara Sa & Judai. Overall Jannat is one of Emraan Hashmi's best film and has a good message that we can all learn from. Other than that it was shot in great locations at Cape Town of South Africa." 
" Not your regular Hashmi-flick","As it has been said in the media,this movie is not your regular hashmi-flick (which either end up being corny or/and extremely boring).I went in to watch the movie with very low expectations but was surprised with the the first half.It had a nice and enjoyable plot and i especially liked the opening card game (me being a big time card enthusiast).The second half more or less fell apart with all the emotions flying in.It suffers from what i call "The Soap Opera mentality" where every small thing is made a very big deal of.Emran Hashmi was extremely believable as the grey-charactered high profile match fixer. His speaking style, i felt somehow, encapsulated the apprehensiveness yet decisiveness of a fixer. I would say this performance by him was his best,second only to one in Gangster. Vipin Sharma(Arjun's dad) was rather flat while delivering his dialogs and so did the emotionless Sonal Chauhan. The one performance i was bowled over by in this movie was of Javed Shaikh(especially the weight in his voice).Another let down in the movie was for the ones among us who wanted more of insider-story from the match-fixing scenario. There, the movie lacked material.it ended up more as a love story rather than a match-fixing story(which quite a few of us were hoping for).I would rate this movie a 8/10, a definite watch if you have got the time and can bear the second half that gets all draggy." 
" a brilliant movie:EMRAAN HASHMI at his best","when i watched this movie for the first time, i did not like it to much, because i'm not one of EMRAAN HASHMI' fun, but when i saw it yesterday, i must see it's a masterpiece for an actor like EMRAAN HASHMI.Jannat is the story of a man caught in a quagmire of crime and consumerism as he struggles to find heaven on earth. Arjun is a reckless young man with an obsession for making money at card games. A chance meeting with a girl in a mall, Zoya gives him the reasons he was looking for to move out of his ordinary life. He steps up from playing small-time card games to becoming a bookie. Stuck in a triangle of sorts between the woman he loves and his addiction to make a quick buck, Arjun moves on from being a bookie to a runner for the mafia. He steps into the world of match fixing. Arjun switches on the limelight to bigger, better, faster, more, until his dizzying rise attracts the attention of the police. Arjun has to now choose between the love of his life, Zoya, and this new found success and power. As Arjun struggles to choose between the two, the Don offers the forbidden apple of limitless wealth in exchange of his soul and draws him into his core entourage of money spinners. How far will the horizon of reality stretch as Arjun and Zoya tread a fine, fast-blurring line between right and wrong to find the heaven they have been looking for?just see this movie, i believe that you will enjoy it, if you are looking for a good story, BHATT gives you as usual one of the greatest stories of all the time, if you are looking for acting, EMRAAN HASHMI is at his best, and also K.K makes the music very fantastic. but don't forget: you will cry when you see the end." 
" Unexpected...!","With an unexpected start, and a rather unexpected-but-touchy end, this movie was one great ride.I rushed to the cinema hoping to buy the evening Bhootnath show, which was "house full"...so "i had no choice and in desperation of not wanting to waste my journey i decided to pass my time with Jannat"...I wish I could take my words back...because it proved ironical! Mahesh Bhatt showed us again that like the movie, he can be unexpected himself. With a brilliant and soothing soundtrack, a little-off-the-track acting, a different storyline, and a BRILLIANT TOUCHY ENDING, this movie just has it all.Critically speaking, there's nothing but the fact that it "did some Hindi-movie-ones" if u know what i mean...? i don't want to spoil the movie for first timers, but for those who've already seen it, i hope you understand...Otherwise, BRILLIANT! and unexpected from sum1 not-so-professional as Emraan...great work!!! Bhootnath can go later...8/10.Worth it." 
" An ode to Deewar?","Emraan  In terms of the shades, the role had immense potential to unleash the true talent in an actor and do what "Naam" did for Sanjay Dutt. Having said that, a confident performance here. Sonal Chauhan Barring a few plastic moments, her performance is not too bad for a first-timer. The svelte figurine, if chooses wisely can survive in Bollywood. And very addictive smile.Sameer Kochhar  This actor is too handsome hunk to be a police officer. And why was he munching all the time? Vishal Malhotra  there was no value addition of this role to the movie per se'. When the apartment is raided, why does it scare the living daylights of him? And later he jumps in to be a partner in major crime? Bad characterisation!Vipin Sharma Probably owing to lack of screen time, the character seems unwarranted. Perhaps hangover of TPZ.Jawaid Shaikh - I wonder if it is the actor or the writing department who should take blame here for turning it into a character role. Have we forgotten Paresh Rawal in "Naam"? BTW even the one-way street dialogue from "Naam" is reprised here. Perhaps the weakest villain from Bhatt's camp. Songs as usual from the house of Bhatt's do bear the trademark stamp over it and posses repeat value.Kunal holds the reigns well for the first timer. By another couple of rounds, time will tell.The promos set a different expectation bar altogether in the audience's mind. Cricket though infused into the storyline is not integral to it and hence it would be safe to say that justice was "not" done to the subject.The last 30-minutes could have been easily trimmed to give it a slick finish. The climax was definitely long-winded and practically even the blind can see it coming.PS: The dig at Sidhu.. I agree too!" 
" Left a lot to be desired","Now I am convinced 'Good trailers do not make good movies'. The audience was lured into believing 'Jannat' had all the elements of a movie which would explore the hidden truths behind betting, match fixing and et al but except for a few patches of brilliance the movie reminded me of Anurag bose's Gangster where a protégé turns hostile against the betting baron at the behest of his girl friends' incessant appeals to quit illegal activities and return to normal civic life. The story had such a beaten plot that even a 5 year old could predict the climax only half way through the movie.It begins well with Emraan's sixth sense serving him good for betting practices but loses its way completely. The insipid romance between the two leads did more damage to the otherwise convincing story telling. What left me completely aghast was the turn of events in South-Africa where the director took his creative imagination too far to show a pole dancing heroine and dressing room cold blooded murder. The movie fell under the gravity of expectations of its director who tried to do too many things instead of sticking with the plot. There were so many incomplete subplots like that of girls conceited stance on morality, her own love for glamour, father's inexplicable hatred towards his son , and the all important modus operandi of match fixing mafia . Instead we had to content ourselves with typical villainous certain bhais and a self indulgent hero who was caught unaware of his girls' sinister motives. .I wish Mr. Director had given more dendrites to the screenplay. Music was good indeed , Emraan hashmi was in his 'business as usual' role and the movie was not what it could have been ." 
" Crass!! Awful with no sense","Wasteful and criminal waste of Time if u want to watch it.The story is about a person(Arjun) who loves gambling,flirting etc etc (almost everything non productive) After loosing a lot of money in gambling he is under debt but rather than thinking of paying back he falls in love and the money which his friend gave him to clear the debt is squandered in buying gift for his girl friend(How bad can you do...)When the lender (supposedly a Goon) gets after him ,our protagonist Arjun Discovers that he has a gift for predicting the outcome of cricket Matches. Wow!!!!!!What gets me wondering is ,how on earth he gets this power to predict only Cricket matches with 100% accuracy .omg!!!!! and since when did GOD started being so specific in terms of giving physic powers to humans. So we might have another arjun who can predict Hockey,Soccer....etc etc. Well this is not the end of bad and a loosely done script. so after paying his debt and earning loads of money .Arjun starts to work for an Underworld don based in South Africa. Mr Don who has a empire wants to make money thru cricket betting and employs Arjun have a multiplier effect on his wealth. Arjun is given the task of fixing matches...Now this is sheer stupidity and the story writer has completely lost it here. First the script says ,Arjun can do predict the outcome without knowing anything and later he is given the job to fix matches. What is the need to fix matches when he knows the result without talking to anyone. Cant they just make money by knowing everything in advance..Where is the need to fix matches by going and talking to players.....So you can well understand how badly written this movie is. Don't know why this movie was made and what did the writer had in his mind..but it is total crap except for some songs...Must Avoid !!!!!!! unless u believe everything that is shown on the screen." 
" A Hit plot of betting but overshadowed by the love angle","The Bhatts always are the first on making movies on the most controversial and current topics. With the IPL fever on, they now return with a movie based on the plot of betting and match fixing in cricket along with an elaborate angle of an intense love affair.The film starts promisingly and ends brilliantly but in the mid it loses pace and interest as the narration stresses more on the love angle than on the interesting betting plot. The first one hour of the movie is exciting and highly enjoyable. Watching it you feel like seeing something new and an unexplored plot. The betting & match fixing scenes in the first half are brilliantly directed by the debutant director Kunal Deshmukh. And when you are expecting more of similar stuff coming later the director changes tracks and takes on the love angle as his main theme.If the film would have been strictly on the betting and fixing plot then it was a confirm bigger Hit. But unfortunately there is more of sacrifice and love story angle which is quite expected and becomes tiring after a certain point. Though director shows promise in his first movie but he should have stuck to one plot only.Imraan Hashmi is competent and gives a good performance. It can be counted as one of his finest. Sonal Chauhan looks fresh and ravishing. She has got the talent which will become polished with more of her movies. Jawed Sheikh as the DON shows class and he shines bright in his role. A very unexpected act is given by Samir Kochhar as the police officer. He is excellent in his small part and is an actor to watch for.Bhatts definitely have a good ear for music and lyrics. Their movies always have some good numbers with meaningful lyrics. Jannat also has got hit music by Pritam. The songs don't interrupt the narration and have got the soothing melodies. That's the reason audio companies fought with each other for the music rights of this movie.If you are a cricket fan and expecting a lot of cricket, betting and match fixing in the movie then you might be taken back. The movie has the main plot of betting but the story revolves more around the match fixer and his girlfriend. That's the main drawback of the movie. The other weak point is that the background of Imraan Hashmi and Sonal are not explained in details. Sonal just leaves India for a live in relation with Imraan and there is no one in her family who has to be informed. Thought the love proposal scenes are highly enjoyable but after the intermission you feel the overdose of the affair angle.As per their tradition Bhatts this time follow a similar plot as in "Two For The Money" (2005) featuring Al Pacino. But this time its only an inspiration and not a version. The script also gets inspired by the real life "Coach Murder" incident in the last world cup.One of the highlight of "Jannat" is its climax, which is unexpected and has a shock for the viewers. After witnessing the climax sequence you feel that the film is good enough for a one time watch. As it has a new plot, good performances and soothing music." 
" its an entertainer - good way to kill time on an evening","the new movie from bhatt production house has been released to a great hype following the success of awarapan. Don't go to the movie expecting too much. Its just a time killer that will keep u busy till the end.A gambler turns into a cricket bookie finding that he has a sixth sense of guessing what will happen the next ball. But his urge to make quick money pushes him into match fixing and he looses control of his life and love. The ending is very dramatic which lends the punch at the end. i kind of liked it.Imran delivers a steady performance. He has done alright in similar roles in the past. the soundtrack and background score is good. Its a good way to kill time on an evening." 
" what a waste of time . awful movie .","i just read somewhere that the film is a hit and i wonder why after having watched it . i think its because of its music and because of ipl . now there's nothing in the movie thats worth talking about or something that you haven't seen before . the direction at its best is just average . in fact the dircetion is really poor at key points in the film . look at the climax , nothing wrong with it from the script point of view but how tackily done by the director . to give him some respect he was aided by some really bad acting .**spoiler alert**the movie seems to copy loads of thing from loads of places . naam for instance , then this movie called two for money, gangster - when the girl screams 'you killed him you bastards' it worked there but not here . what i really wonder is if this movie is really a hit or is it just publicity . or doeds it take just good music and some decent scenes and a controversial topic like match fixing and a good banner to make a movie tick at the box office , if so i feel sad at the state of Hindi films . when will we grow up . if jannat is hit then what kind of movies must be flopping , they must be really bad ." 
" Jannat is quite nice attempt by Bhatts","I watched Jannat yesterday evening. I have to say that it was quite an intense movie with good performances except from the female lead (débutant Sonal). A powerful actress could have enacted it with more power and punch. Emraan is very impressive and first rate in this movie. The story is quite novel and good. The twist at the interval was quite shocking to me, I did not expected that. Overall the support cast was also good. South Africa locales are good and cinematography is good. I liked the end a lot even though others may have different opinion. Th movie does not look like that it has been directed by a débutant. I will be looking forward for further movies from the director. Go for it guys.." 
" worth a watch","i expected a lot more from this movie, especially after watching awarapan. arjun dixit(emraan hashmi) is a lucky vagabond (perhaps a bit too lucky) who survives by gambling. ultimately he is debt ridden and does cricket betting to repay his debt. he discovers that he is very good at it and promotes himself to a match fixer. ultimately it becomes his profession. in the mean time he woos a girl and they both fall in love with each other. but the girl dislikes his profession of illegal cricket betting and match fixing and decides to bring him on the right track. at last arjun decides to leave all illegal activities but it happens to be too late. the film portrays a few real life characters.and i must say the songs are mind-blowing.overall the movie is worth watching one time." 
" Cricket bookie","Amazing MovieThis is a story of a man name Arjun (Emraan Hashmi) who want to make quick money and wants to live a luxurious life.
He loves a woman name ZoyaHe is a gambler who turns into a cricket bookie banking on his sixth sense for the game. But his urge to make quick money pushes him into match fixing and he loses control of his life and love.
In the end he kill by the Police" 
" Very good.","The best thing about a Mukhesh Bhatt release is that no one expects much from it. And more often than not, his films turn out to be quite entertaining. He is also credited with having launched budding directors in this new age of Bollywood (Recall : Anurag Basu). Jannat is the directorial debut of Kunal Deshmukh, and among all the flops that have come out of the Indian Hindi film industry this year, Jannat happens to be a huge surprise.Jannat has two parts to its story. The former set in India, the later in South Africa. Essentially, like most Bhatt films, it is a love story. However, its main storyline deals with betting and match fixing in the cricketing world. Arjun, the character portrayed by Emraan Hashmi, is a man with, what he calls, a 'sixth sense'. He is a master predictor of cricket matches. He becomes a bookie and soon gains attention in the eyes of underworld don Abu Ibrahim, who buys arms and ammunitions with the money he makes from betting on cricket matches. Torn apart by his love for the girl of his dreams, Zoya, and his greed for money, Arjun is left with making a choice between living a normal hard-earned life and an easy, yet deceiving one.The first good thing about Jannat is that it has a solid storyline. Whether it is the childish, yet well defined love story, or the complexities of a man who is clearly suffering from some obsessive compulsive disorder or other. Then there is the cricketing world and underworld bit. This is one of the most original and well written story lines to come out of Bollywood this year so far. When it comes to being effective, it achieves that in its entirety in its two hours and twenty minute running time. With everything from the mention of a cricketer turned comedy show host, to the murder of a coach at the World Cup, the storyline is the strongest point of the movie.The music is not as good as one expects it to be. Judai being the pick of the lot. However, the version sung by Kamraan Ahmad is not there in the film. Zara si is just okay. Characteristic of a Bhatt film. Rupam Islam's Hindi singing debut is noticeable, although miss-able. The song is too similar to the songs of his band, Fossils. The background score is very good. It gels in very well with the pace of the film.Emraan Hashmi, apart from having earned the tag of 'serial kisser', happens to be a freakishly good actor. The versatility of the roles that he has done clearly shows that. From being a wife-thief, to an undercover agent, and now a simple man with quite a serious mental disorder. He is like what his dad states in the film - 'A compulsive liar'. And in order to get himself out of any situation, he does what is characteristic of him. He lies some more. Newcomer Sonal Chauhan is okay, making the transition from a sweet and bubbly Mumbai girl to a sexy bar dancer in South Africa. She does look quite anorexic in certain scenes, but as a whole she looks great. Javed Sheikh, as Abu Ibrahim is cold. Effective. Vishal Malhotra, as the sidekick serves the humor quotient well. The lad has come a long way from hosting Disney cartoons on Doordarshan.Bollywood's only great film this year happens to Jodhaa Akbar, with Mithya and Shaurya being the other two 'good' films. Race might be a commercial success, but it is a highly frustrating film. Even Bhootnaath failed to click. Tashan is a no brainer! In a year when Bollywood is churning out flop after flop, Jannat serves as a breath of fresh air. Although far from heavenly, Jannat has a lot to offer at a time when cricket is on the lips of almost every Indian (Read : The IPL).The IPL has come to a stage when it gets boring to sit down and watch an entire game. Do yourself a favor, grab a Jannat ticket and spend two and a half hours in an air conditioned theater watching a film which redefines all the 'Ishtyle' and 'Pharmoola' that Bollywood has been coming up with off late.7/10. Worth it!" 
" Ridiculous!","I have already seen the Hollywood version (Lord of War) why would I want to waste my time in a poor copy? Even in Bollywood, we've seen so many better film with a similar storyline. I can't even believe it's rated highly at all nor that it made all that money at the box office. Most of the scenes are borderline vomit inducing where people either overact their scenes (Emraan Hashmi included) or just plain standing there reading their lines instead of emoting. The newbie girl (an Amrita Rao clone) who plays Zoya needs to go back to the drawing board and learn acting first instead of just voguing for the camera and wearing a ton of makeup. Bollywood has truly gone to the dogs in a world where films like this are lauding and given special treatment at the box office." 
" Just one word, awful............second word, don't watch!","Well not a jannat in true sense but kind of hell in real sense.i won't say that you shouldn't watch it, watch it and get tortured....yes !! No screenplay. No acting. Foolish story(age-old).Meanwhile our hero's basic instincts work overtime (and we aren't implying Emraan's mandatory lip-locks here). He proclaims of his sharp sixth sense that can predict every single move in the cricket matches as if he were some ancestor of Nostradamus. From betting on matches, he turns a bookie and subsequently upgrades himself as a match-fixer. Rather than an elaborate evolution, the progression of his character is rushed through one transition song. Moreover the offhand approach through which he lures cricket captains amidst match innings by his casual conversations in locker rooms is to be seen to be believed. I wasted my money, time on it, could have watched the Narnia."
