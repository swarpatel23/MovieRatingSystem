" Don't waste valuable time of your life watching this","music--awful script--one of the worst, even stalwarts like naseruddin shah or paresh rawal looked idiotic due to scriptsaction sequence--these kind of action sequences were shown in 90sacting--out of the 1000 one liners in the movie, maybe 2-3 can really make you giggleAnees Bazmee creates below average films -thats true, but this one is definitely one of his worst!It's hard to believe these kind of movies are coming out in 2015!!Don't waste your time watch welcome instead!" 
" Crappy script - Serious Disappointment","Sequel of Welcome, which was quite an enjoyable film. This films stars all the A-listers, which was the reason it got droves of people to watch it in the first place. Honestly, the film is a disappointed. With the likes of Nana Patekar and Paresh Rawal. Their presence makes it livelier but the weak story line seriously undermines the whole experience.The film show casts Dubai shorelines, which look amazing on the big screen. However, the direction was choppy. One particular sequence was just down right stupid when skydivers are above Palm one moments and appear next to their target the next in the sandy dunes of remote UAE.The A-listers are gold and their on-screen performance was what kept things going but the new cast, Shruti Hassan and Dimple's Daughter (in the film) did a pretty shoddy job.Film to let go by in the cinema and probably catch up on a Saturday afternoon in front of Tele." 
" Not as good as expected. Welcome was too good.","This movie is a crap. South Indian movies are now moving towards Hollywood and our so called Bollywood is degrading itself by making movie like this. I watched it for Brahmanandam but he is not in the movie for a heavy role. Plot was not as good as expected. The maker tried to make a spicy movie but failed and produced a KHICHDI. These type of movies are such a shame of Indian Bollywood. I wasted my 2.30 hrs watching this crap. Naseeruddin shah was not enough good as RDX. Mark my word John Abraham can never be an actor he is good at modelling so go back John this is not your cup of tea. Shruti should stay in South industry as its a very bad movie for her career. Picturisation is not good. Director used sports car for the Shareef Businessman where is your mind director?" 
" Biggest disaster of 2015","Nowadays, film producers are hiring marketing and advertising agencies not only to promote their movies, but also to improve IMDb ratings. They post fake reviews and rate films greatly to fetch more people to the theaters. About the movie: This movie is completely baseless and crap. Dialogues are good as the dialogue writer is a stickler in writing comedy. Direction is fine, but the most important aspect "the script" is baseless. The movie will nettle you after the interval and you might feel annoyed by it. Go and watch this movie if you want to waste your hard earned money. P.S this is my first review on IMDb" 
" Despite weak script and poor direction – Welcome Back is watchable only because of three aces – Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar and Paresh Rawal","Films like DON, Dhoom, Murder, Bhoothnath, Golmaal series and Tanu Weds Manu has generated enough curiosity among movie mongers to spawn their eagerly awaited sequels. Follow-up to the smash-hit Welcome (2007), Welcome Back was right there with high dose of entertainment value but looses the steam due to the fiddling climax, wafer-thin plot and tuneless music.Uday and Majnu wants to marry off his sister to someone from a good family background if he wants to get married to Chandni. Story gets further complicated when Ranjana(Uday's sister) falls in love with Mumbai goon ( John Abraham) who is completely opposite to what Uday and Majnu expected.Anees Bazmee has mastered of making no-sense and yet entertaining films ( No Entry, Welcome, Singh Is King, Ready) . With Welcome Back, Bazmee has gone one step-further. He has created a mish-mash plot and sub-plots that will make you pull your hair. You do not bargain for logic here as anything can happen from anywhere and at anytime. The good news is despite all the foolishness, the films work thanks to the quick-witted tapori humour, funny scenes and threesome- Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar and Paresh Rawal who are sure to bring down the house with their rib-tickling act. The climax plays a spoil-sport and you wish director could have made it more smart, crispy and shorter version. The dialogues, especially, by Raaj Shaandilyaa is noteworthy and will remain with you after the film. Lets be frank- there is nothing called "screenplay" in the film. Editing is terribly loose. The budget is pretty high (estimated to be Rs 100 crores) which makes sense considering high production values and shooting locations in Dubai. Cinematography sometimes rolls out to make film look like 90's potboiler entertainer but nevertheless is magnus. Music is a big letdown. The hopeless film stands on the shoulders of 3 supremely talented actors – Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar and Paresh Rawal. The chemistry between them is sparkling and convincing that you will love every moment of them in the film. Anil Kapoor is simply mindblowing. Nana Patekar is equally outstanding. Watch for the scene when they play antakshri in the graveyard. Paresh Rawal is splendid. He gets to deliver witty-one-liners and does it with ease. John Abraham is decent with his tapori looks. Shruti Hassan should start thinking of some other profession. Naseeruddin Shah does not making any impact replacing the role of legendary Feroze Khan. as Wanted Bhai. Dimple Kapadia surprises with astounding performance. She gets to deliver some good lines as well.Despite weak script and poor direction – Welcome Back is watchable only because of three aces – Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar and Paresh RawalDecent – 2.75/5" 
" Don't Welcome this family...","Welcome Back (2015)A sequel to the 2007 comic caper Welcome starring Anil kapoor, Nana Patekar, John Abraham, Paresh Rawal and Shruti Hasaan in the lead. Directed by Anees Bazmi.The movie fails miserably in the sequel. The first part was a laughter riot but it does not create the same magic again. I didn't had any expectation from the movie still I convinced myself to watch this. The only thing I enjoyed in the movie was watching Majnu and Uday Shetty, rest all failed to entertain me. John Abraham is not at all suitable for comedy roles. His expressions are worst. He can only do films like Madras Cafe (He is best in that type of roles). Shruti Hasaan has to learn a lot in terms of acting and comic timing. You will surely miss Akki (Akshay Kumar) in the sequel.The first half of the movie is too boring, you can have some laughs in the post interval part. I had never experienced such bad songs and their lyrics in recent movies. Anees Bazmi is known for directing good comedy movies but this time He had made a very illogical and a totally senseless movie. Watch this movie at your own risk and please leave your brain at home if you convinced yourself for watching Welcome Back. 1.5/5 or 4/10" 
" Brainless yet fun","I wasn't expecting much from the film from the beginning however unexpectedly it did provided some fun time though the film had weak direction and weak story. The first thing I must say is that there is not much difference to see in this film from the predecessor,similar situations and very similar plot (though the first part was way much better). Let's start with the pros first Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar did a fine job in portraying the characters of Majnu and Udai just like before. The film is pretty funny in second half and few dialogs are pretty cleverly written and have many amazing and beautiful locations. However still they were not able to fill in for the cons which include bad songs and some very unfunny jokes along with bad visual effects which by the way felt unnecessary. I was pretty disappointed with performance of Shruti Hasan as she did not stood out much and also with Paresh Rawal not getting more screen time and John Abraham's performance which yet again did not left a mark. The film doesn't make much sense and has pretty brainless plot I won't recommend this film if if you want something which makes sense however you can watch if you leave brain at home." 
" Over the top, illogical, but just leave your brain at home and enjoy Welcome Back. The 90s are back!","Before I start analyzing Welcome Back, let me state on the onset that the sequel comes nowhere close to the original cult classic comedy Welcome. I mean the the sequel is even missing Akshay Kumar, need I say more. The sequel follows the template of the original, for example Manju and Uday are going to get there sister married again( a different one), the film is like a remake almost with a couple of things changed, with newer jokes, characters etc. But the real question is does the film work, does it entertain. Well I was entertained for the 2hrs and 30 min length time.The film like it promised from the trailer was a full pasia vasool, illogical, zany comic entertainer. Its a family entertainer, but the film carries a beware tag, that you must leave your brains at home while watching Welcome Back to full enjoy the film.This is because the film is highly illogical, the story at times feels totally unbelievable,some of scenes are cringe worthy, but I mean its 90s bollywood at its finest, its what we come to except for a typical Anees Bazmee film. But let me state again if your looking for logic don't watch WB. Pseudo-Intellectuals beware.The story is a completely illogical tale. The film starts off 7 years later after the last ended, Uday Bhai and Majnu Bhai are now completely clean and normal people, they own a hotel, they are rich, they have little or nothing to do with the Underworld or violence anymore.They suddenly realize that there getting very old, but they cant find any women too marry, they then both end up falling in love with the same women, who is a con woman, who is trying to leave them high and dry. The Con woman along with her mother act as a Queen and Princess. Both Majnu and Uday realize that have fallen in love with the same girl when out of nowhere Uday's dad shows up with his new daughter from his third unknown marriage and tells Uday he has to get her married cause she is his sister ( and because he is old), the queen and princess insist too so they can get out of there problem. Running parallel Ghunagroo finds out his wife has a child from another marriage who ends being a big gangster in Mumbai. Manju and Uday, after finding out Ghunagroo has a son want to finalize there sisters wedding with his son, he first accepts but then he tries to get out of the marriage because he doesn't want Manju and Uday to find out his son is a gangster. But as luck has it there sister falls in love with Ghunagroo son Ajju Bhai, and when Manju and Uday find out about this they try to stop the marriage. They want a respectable man for there sister. They go running to Wanted Bhai for help to stop the marriage, because they are scared of Ajju the gangster.Wanted Bhai is blind and ends up being the biggest gangster of them all, but at his island Manju and Uday find out his drug ridden son is also somehow in love with there sister too. The rest of story is about who marries Manju and Uday's sister Rajnaha.Acting wise the film has a huge cast but only a couple of acts standout. Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar own the film there chemistry is hilarious, there are a laugh riot. Paresh Rawal is in complete form, he is very good. John Abraham is good as the typical Mumbai tapoori. Shruti Hassan is okay, but provides a good glamor quotient. Dimple Kapadia is wasted. Shiny Ahuja is loud. Nasserudin Shah is at his hamming best.See Welcome Back is the perfect film too watch at a single screen where the masses lap, over the top masala entertainers. WB is kind of a stress buster, you just watch the film and enjoy the buffoonery. But even for a masala entertainer one wishes the story was a little better, a little logic is needed. And the music is far from even being mediocre. The VFX are pretty below average also, and while the film moves at a fast pace, the 2nd half drags a bit. However the film is mounted well Dubai looks nice, and its nice to see expensive cars, helicopters, mansions etc.Overall Welcome Back is nowhere close to the prequel there is no comparison, however as a stand alone comedy, its still good.Its a typical Anees Bazmee film, its illogical, its over the top, its zany, but its good fun for people who enjoy leave your brain at home masala entertainment. A recommended watch if your fan of Anil Kapoor or Nana Patekar because they own the film.3/5* or 6/10" 
" Dumb, stupid, but......","Welcome released way back in 2007, and while it is by no means a great film, it was a highly entertaining film which has a few gags which still hold up. Welcome back has taken its own sweet time to release, and while I enjoyed the first welcome, I didn't have very high expectations for this one, the main reason being the replacement of Akshay Kumar with John Abraham. But I saw the film and it surprisingly ended up entertaining me for majority of its running time.The good: Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar are once again in top form.It is their chemistry which makes you sit through the movie, which otherwise is a mindless mess.Rajpal Yadav chips in with a cameo and does well. Paresh Rawal too is good.A few gags do evoke genuine laughter, especially that graveyard scene in the second half.The bad: John does well as the action hero, but his tapori accent seemed a bit irritating after a while. Shruti hassan and debutant Ankita looked good but they did not have much to do.same for Dimple Kapadia.The late Feroz Khan played RDX in the first movie, the great Naseeruddin Shah plays a similar character Wanted Bhai in this movie, but came across as strictly unfunny.Shiny Ahuja was plain irritating.The movie is way too long at over 150 mins, and the second half drags a lot leading to a ridiculous climax. The climax does leave you cold big time.none of the songs stay with you, is another major putoff, given there are many.Overall, Welcome back is better than i had expected, it is worth a watch but do not expect it to equal the first film." 
" Even Mindless script can be better Then This..Thanks to Nana and Anil who made it a time pass","Welcome Back - Although i didn't find Akhsay kumar good when he does Childish characters but he was Cute in WELCOME . And thanks to Nana Patekar and Anil Kapoor with good support of Paresh Raawal and cameo from late Feroz Khan Welcome was one of those movies from the Director Aneez Bazmi(one of the director in Bollywood whom i dislike most) which was enjoyable to me. But no he is not able to repeat it with the sequel. John Abraham not being anywhere close to cuteness is one the worst actor to cast in a comedy movies (sorry fans he can do serious film but not comedy). But John is not the worst character of the film. Rather its Nassiruddin Shah whose character was so badly written that just after his entry (after interval) movie starts to drag and when ever he was on screen he was irritating and not funny at all. Why exactly he waste himself in such bad movies , don't he have better work to do. And why i am not saying Shahini Ahuja as the worst character , thats because i actually don't consider him as being in the movie (not worth of talking . Ahuja sir has an exceptional quality of doing bad acting even bad as compared to Jackie Bagnani and Tushar Kapoor. Then there is Dimple Kapadia , wasted too . And yes we have a debut too , Ankita Srivastava. Somebody please tell her that she has a really irritating voice matched with bad expression which cant be compensated by short dresses she wears. I am shocked that i am saying this but i really missed Malika Sherawat. So what are we left with. Nana Patekar and Anil Kapoor and some good support of Paresh Raawal. Even if the movie was bad but the chemistry between Anil and Nana was mind blowing. And yes the dialogue writer have done a fabulous job. Comic jokes although not intelligent but entertaining are spread all over the movies. Watch out for the scene when John called Anil as "AEEE TEDHE KANDHE". But its the bad script (actually Aneez Bazmi never waste his time in writing any script so there was no script just a situation) , bad songs and such a loud background music which will gave you the headache . Infect i have a special complain about the background scores and the music. It was just noise , no rhyme nothing , just irritation. The prequel had some really entertaining songs. This one just have one - Meet Me Daily . Not because its a great song but because Nana and Anil made it entertaining. I have always said that ALL THE BEST from Rohit Setthy had the worst climax of ever but today i am giving that post to Welcome Back. And why showing so much on non sense CGI if budget is not big and such CGI are not at all important to the movie. Aneez Bazmi must have thought that the audience only contains child below 10 year. Anyways i am tired of writing bad things and i don't have anything good to write about it. 5.6/10. Watch it for Nana and Anil but not at all in theater rather in your TV while cooking dinner as concentration is something which you don't need while watching this.. By ANuP APu KuMaR." 
" Go Back! ♦ Grade F","If Welcome (2007) was like spreading lots of peanut butter on a brown bread slice using a butter spreader, its sequel is like sprinkling white bread crumbs on a bowl of stale peanuts that belongs in a dustbin. The latter does not even make sense.The Shetty brothers (Patekar & Kapoor) have left the underworld and are now in the real estate business. Their sister's in-laws Ghungroo (Rawal) and his wife are leading a peaceful life. But out of nowhere, both the parties find that they have a sister (Hasan) and an illegitimate son (Abraham), respectively, to euphemistically dispose of. As bizarre as it may sound, this sister and this son meet and fall in love and engage in tonsil hockey all in a matter of hours. But since the Shetty brothers have shed their criminal threads, they do not want Ghungroo's wife's illegitimate son to marry their Donald Duck of a sister because he is a local Mumbai don. As you see, the tables have turned and all that we have on the table are stale peanuts.There seems to be a competition among the actors to come up with the worst performance. I was excited to see disgraced actor Shiny Ahuja's name pop up on the beginning credits, but unfortunately he wins the competition, followed by beasty Abraham (god damn Baazigar over here) as the runner up. The remaining take home consolation prizes, with the exception of Patekar, who is the only reason the film does not totally slip into nothingness.Numerous songs stuffed inside the poor screenplay that play in tandem produces the right amount of boredom in its audience who by the end of the 150-minute film are sure to consult their therapists. The film gasps for a story, which looks repetitive if you have enjoyed the prequel, and the small amount of humor that it does have is mindless slapstick that induce nothing more than a titter. As a result, the screenplay tries to entertain itself by allowing its characters to play antakshari in a graveyard with two fake bodies doing rounds around them.If you're still inclined to spend money on the film, all you have to do is visualize and consider this sequence: the illegitimate son hops from one camel's hump to another to another and so on to save an underworld don from a sandstorm that's breezing in. Poor camels.BOTTOM LINE: Anees Bazmee's Welcome Back is sure a mindless comedy with frequent doses of action and songs that may appeal to some, but the real question is, is this a sign of Bollywood's tread into darkness?GRADE: F.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" Barely watchable","The sequel fails to entertain in the slightest bit. It is boring to watch even with a bunch of friends.Lines were weak, dance numbers didn't do anything to entertain the audience and the overall theme is the exact same as the previous movie.The acting itself was substandard, leaving much to be desired. Some parts of the movie were amusing but not enough to make it worth watching.The script seemed randomly thrown in with poor screenplay, mediocre directing and annoying cut-scenes.Welcome Back fails to live up to expectations set by the original." 
" Too much predictable and childish yet entertaining","WELCOME BACK REVIEW- When Welcome released i was 17 years old and that time i never used to watch movies in theater. But watched it on TV and felt very very bad that why i did not watch it in theater. Felt like i missed the gem of comedy cinema. Seen it almost 50+times and i am big fan of Welcome movie. Since then i am waiting for it sequel like anything but when watched 1st trailer of Welcome Back i didn't find it impressive then 2nd trailer came and it was better than 1st trailer. But movie generated enough buzz for me because of those 2 trailers but i wasn't expecting a gem of comedy like its prequel. My expectations were neither low nor high. And after watching it today in theater,i say it was a good movie really. Obviously, you cant expect better movie than Welcome if you are sensible comedy lover so this one has comedy but not sensible at all. Even i thought this one will be a crap movie but movie proved me wrong. First half entertains you lot with punches and some crispy dialogues by setting plot of the movie. Story is exactly opposite to its prequel's story i don't wanna expose it now cause it will kill all fun of watching it for movie lovers. But second half drags its not as good as first half. It has no sense at all, too many childish and vfx scenes are there which looks really crap. And movie ends at unsatisfying note which really hurts audience. Now lets move on to actors, the first name comes in mind is Nana Patekar. The leader of this movie army, has a best role in the movie. Shines like a Prime Star, steals the show on his dialogue delivery and accent. Then second star is Anil Kapoor who had second best role. These two are enough to entertain you but you get extra bonus here in the form of Paresh Rawal. Another fine performance by fine actor. John's accent was too loud and too tapori. Sometimes it feels irritating, not appreciable at all. Shruti Hasan looks good but her dialogues and accent remains same as she does in every movie. Nasiruddin Shah did whatever director told him but i didn't find it impressive. Other supporting star cast were good as it was in Welcome. Music is a big disappointment here. Its prequel had chart buster music but Welcome Back doesn't even got a single hit song. Really music composer definitely deserves some bad words from everybody. Screenplay was smartly written but not completely it has some minuses at some scenes it was too predictable. Production is high scale shot the film on gorgeous locations. Director Anees Bazmi tried to give his best but failed to make a successful gem like Welcome. Still he gave some mind blowing scenes and dialogues to be remembered for long time. Overall a good family entertainer for all ages and all kind of audiences. Classes wont like film that much as masses would but both will find it A Paisa Vasool Entertainer. Go and watch Welcome Back enjoy your time but don't expect much and do not compare it with Welcome. 6 * stars by me." 
" Predictable, but Entertainer! Bhais are rocking!","A sequel of a 2007 blockbuster, Welcome! Welcome became a huge hit, and after that, Aneez Bazmee didn't get any success through his films, so he decided to make a sequel and be successful once more. In the sequel, Akshay Kumar is missing. While, Anil Kapoor as Majnubhai and Nana Patekar as Uday Shetty are remain as it is to entertain the audience through their antic styles and behavior. Paresh Rawal is little bit dull as Dr.Ghungharu as compare to Welcome. RDX has been replaced by Wantedbhai, and Naseeruddin Shah plays it nicely, and entertains too. John Abraham is in the lead, he tries new styles and body language, but fails to impress. Shruti Hasan is as usual okay. Dimple Kapadiya has nothing to do. Shine Ahuja is back, but fails to mark his presence among this bigger casts. New heroine is very poor in acting. Special mansion for Rajpal Yadav, who had only two scenes, but audience is enjoying his presence in the hall. Plus points : The name itself, Welcome. Then Uday-Majnu's chemistry, Graveyard scene, funniest one liners even better than Welcome. Mostly enjoyable parts except the climax. Minus points : Poor music and poor lyrics, unnecessary songs, boring fight scenes, and the most importantly, stupid climax sequence, in which John is running on camels or bomb type helicopters or you can say the whole climax. It is a very very dumb attempt, if they don't have much money than why the hell they planned it to shoot and that also in poor vfx. This is showing the poor thing of Bollywood. No need to do an outdoor shoot if you can't afford it or you don't have the knowledge of how to shoot! So, audience are going to the theater and movie is earning a bigger amount. It's up to you to watch or not. It will also going to be hit on TV. So, if you skip this in theater, no worry, the TV channels will be telecast this probably every weekend!" 
" Welcome Back!!!!","When was the last that you watched a movie and after two and a half hours all you wanted was refund? Well it happened to me this evening when I watched Welcome Back. There are bad movies (Humshakals), there are worse movies (Himmatwala) then there is fifty feet of crap and then there is Welcome Back. The movie begins with the Majnu(Anil Kapoor) and Uday(Nana Patekar) living an honest life but still not entirely happy as they haven't been able to find a suitable bride for themselves. Then enter Maharani and her daughter(Ddimple Kapadia and Ankita Shrivastava respectively) and both the Bhais fall for the same girl (again). Only they don't know that these women are not what they say, in reality they are here to con Majnu and Uday. One girl creates the divide between Majnu and Uday and when things are just about to get thick enters Shankar Shetty, Uday's father played by Nana Patekar. He drops him with the news about his third marriage and the daughter he has with that marriage- Ranjahana(Shruti Hasan). And now it's uday's responsibility to find a suitable groom for her. In the meantime Dr. Ghongroo (Paresh Rawal) discovers that her wife too had a son outside her marriage which he was never told about. This son of Ghongroo is a local goon in Mumbai, Ajju Bhai(Jhon Abraham). Uday and Majnu want Ghongroo to marry their sister with his son as they don't know that he is not what they think he is but little do they know that their sister already is in love with the same guy. After getting to know the truth about Ajju they decide to take help from the underworld don Wanted Bhai(Nasseruddin Shah), but again are unknown of the fact that his son Honey(Shiny Ahuja) is in love with their sister too. All this lead to a series of confusion and that's how we have our movie. The story of the movie has nothing new to offer as it is a complete rip off of welcome with slight changes here and there and two new characters of maharani and his daughter (which still doesn't change a thing). The script written by Anes Bazmi himself is filled with dialogues which are trying too hard to be funny but ends up being more than just lame (except few dialogues by Nana Patekar). Welcome didn't have great music but still the songs had a unique quality about them. But in welcome back music is as bad as it can get. The soundtracks for welcome back was composed by seven artists- Meet bros, Mika Singh, Honey Singh, Milind Gaba, Abhishek Ray, Sidhant Madhvan and Anu Malik but not even one of them couldn't make a single soundtrack that one can take back with them. The lyrics of these songs make it even worse. The background score which was the high point of welcome's music department too fails miserably as it is nothing but the remixed version of the background score of welcome. The ensemble cast of welcome back too fails to deliver unlike it happened with welcome. Apart from Nana Patekar and Nasseruddin Shah none of the actors have managed to put up a decent show. John Abraham has always been a little short when it came to comedy but here he is completely out of space and for once Akshay kumar is missed. Paresh Rawal has sleep walked through his role of Dr. Ghongroo as he had nothing to offer in this movie. So did Ankita Shrivastava and Dimple Kapadia who was completely out of space and showed a complete lack of comic timing. Anil Kapoor was a star in the previous one but here he is totally forgettable in his Majnu avtar with too much tilted shoulder (which in no way is funny). Nana Patekar is one actor to watch out in this movie. He has an excellent comic timing and has flawless expressions. With Nasseruddin Shah, he is the only actor who makes you laugh sometimes here and there. If someone said that Katrina Kaif was just an eye candy in welcome and had nothing much to do then they should definitely look at Shruti Hasan in this one who just can't act, and more she tries more bad it looks. She had the most forgettable performance in this ensemble cast. If bad acting, music and story want enough, direction by Anes Bazmi is the final nail in the coffin. He is not just bad, he is pathetic. He not only doomed the movie with bad story or script or dialogue but also his direction. There was no direction in the movie as there wasn't a story. All he had to do was shoot the same scenes that were there in welcome with a different set. Welcome was a complete disaster in every department. It is simply one of the worst movies to come out not only this year but in few years. This sequel to the 2007 hit comedy is nothing but your worst nightmare coming true. Apart from Nana Patekar there is nothing in this movie to watch, literally nothing." 
" Welcome Back review","Story 4/10: the story for welcome back is just about the same as welcome just with a few minor changes. The first half movie is a treat to watch. It does get messy for 20 minutes after the interval but catches its grip back but the climax just spoils a well made movie and comes as a huge disappointment. Setting 10/10: the setting of Dubai is probably the best you can get in any movieActing 7/10: john Abraham in this act is passable and i think we did miss Akshay Kumar although i don't think Akshay could have done a Goonda Mavali type act. Shruti Hassan needs to change her profession. She doesn't have the right voice and neither expressions. Dimple is passable too as you see her once in a while. Now coming to the heroes of the film Nana Patekar, Anil Kapoor who really drive this film all along and also Paresh Rawal who i had wished to see more of, did do well in his little cameo.Comedy 10/10: it was like a laughter riot. It kept our smiles till the end. The cemetery part was probably the funniest. But as i said only the 3 versatile actors, Nana, Anil and Paresh deliver the jokes with great timing.Watch/not: its worth your money and if you leave your brains home, you will enjoy the comedy."
