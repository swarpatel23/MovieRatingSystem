" WARNING: This film is NOT for Pretentious Snobs!","I don't normally bother to write any reviews for films I have watched. But after reading some of the reviews of imbeciles who CLEARLY missed the point of Dabangg, I felt compelled to add my two cents.Firstly, to all those people who are bashing Dabangg because it's action scenes are over the top, or it can't decide whether it's an action film/comedy/drama etc........here's a thought.....do you think maybe (just MAYBE) that was the whole point in the first place?? This is generally the problem with the nouveau Indian cinema goers of the multiplex era. They will happily watch Bruce Willis in Die Hard 4 bring down a helicopter with a taxi cab. They will applaud when Jason Statham drives a car off a bridge and lands it perfectly on to a moving truck in The Transporter. They will not bat an eyelid when Pierce Brosnan drives around in an invisible car in Die Another Day. Uma Thurman single handedly killing a hundred Chinese assassins with a sword in Kill Bill? "Sure, that can happen. And a very good movie from Tarantino" they might say. But GOD FORBID that any Indian movie has action scenes where the hero launches a guy in front of a speeding train and pulls him back just before the train smashes into him. "NOOOOOOO!!!!" they will scream. "That is so stupid!" they will say. "Where is the REALISM?" they will exclaim. A bunch of HYPOCRITES if you ask me! I mean honestly, any person who expects a serious and realistic action film after the first scene in Dabangg where the two main character's names are established as "Chulbul" and "Makkhi" (and after seeing the trailers of the film no less) is, quite frankly, a moron of the highest order. Dabangg is a film which doesn't take itself seriously for a single second (which already makes it FAR superior and a more honest effort than the over-hyped Ghajini that took itself ridiculously seriously while at the same time offering NOTHING new). It is what it is; a complete no-brainer masala film. And tell me, what is wrong with that? Reading some of the reviews here about how Dabangg is "taking the Hindi Film Industry backwards" you would think that other film industries all over the world just churn out serious films all the time. NEWSFLASH! They don't (as you can see from the list above). Then there are complaints about how some action scenes are copied from Western films (namely Salman's opening scene resembling Transporter), second NEWSFLASH! Hollywood copies A LOT of it's action scenes from Hong Kong and Chinese cinema all the time. But do you complain about that? Of course you don't. Because you are either ignorant or, as said before, hypocritical. As long as the scene is done well, who cares if it's copied from another film? Dabangg sets it's stall out very early on in the proceedings and it has a fabulous kitsch appeal to it. Salman Khan bites into his role with relish and he is clearly having a lot of fun playing Inspector Chulbul Pandey. This material in the hands of other actors might have gone down in flames, but Salman grabs the film by the scruff of it's neck and runs with it. Make no mistake about it, this film is a one-man show and, luckily for us, Salman carries it off with élan. He plays the role of Chulbul with just the right amount of self-mockery (the type of which Shahrukh Khan was aiming for in Om Shanti Om but failed miserably at). There are moans about how actors like Om Puri and Anupam Kher aren't given enough scope, but who cares? Like I said before, this film really doesn't require brilliant performances from secondary characters. Character development is not the agenda here. However, it has to be said that débutant Sonakshi Sinha does perform very well in her (smallish) role.Bottom line: if you are expecting an intelligent and realistic action thriller like any of the Jason Bourne series, then avoid Debangg at all costs. With that sort of mindset you are sure to be disappointed. BUT, if you are in the mood for an old fashioned masala movie in the mould of films such as Die Hard 4, Kung Fu Hustle and Desperado, then you are in for a treat. Just sit back, relax, accept the film for what it is (a pure popcorn and purposefully OTT flick) and let Salman Khan entertain you." 
" Crash Boom Bang... Dabangg!","Abhinav Kashyap's Dabangg was a resounding success, and yet I did not want to watch it. But I ultimately did, and boy am I surprised. This is one typical action-drama-musical-romance Hindi masala movie, but once you start watching it, there's no way you can stop. It's silly, it's ridiculous, it's mad, it lacks a real storyline, but it's so much fun. The movie has great action sequences, fantastic music, an all-star cast, but more than anything it has Salman Khan, who totally delivers in a role that is a caricature of his own image. That's Chulbul Pandey hands down. He's carefree, he's corrupt, he's cruel, he's tough, he's cool, he's got a good heart, and he's dabangg (fearless). He practically encompasses everything that Salman Khan is known for, and the actor wonderfully displays this fun mixture on-screen to create a role he will definitely be remembered for. In many portions, Dabangg works because it's unintentionally hilarious, and the funniest thing about it lies in the fact that it was actually the intention, and that's what makes it so terribly entertaining. And then it has several moments of drama, and they somehow manage to work. In a few words, Dabangg is one of the rarest of it kind, and is one of the best bad movies of recent years. I recommend you to watch it once, and then watch it again, and again, and again..." 
" Salman is way too bigger than movies he acts in.","Salman is way too bigger than movies he acts in. It's always about Salman in his movies. He loves to play almost himself and adds his superstar persona in every role he does and people love it and only he can dare it. The only true star of bollywood, rest others are moons, they need good story, good producer and blah blah blah. If you are expecting drama dose with some character artists working in preachy subject or based on a true story or inspired by some popular book, watch something else. This is strictly Bollywood entertainment and the king is entertainment is at his best.Salman is a corrupt but golden-hearted police officer in a small town of U.P. He dotes on his mother (Dimple) but hates his stepfather (Vinod Khanna) and stepbrother (Arbaaz Khan). He is at loggerheads with the local politician, Sonu Sood, who sets the two half brothers against one another. Sonakshi is Salman's love interest in the film.What's Good: Salman Khan's performance; the songs, particularly Munni badnaam huyi and Tere mast mast do nain; the action and stunts; the humour.What's Bad: Not bad, but the story offers absolutely no novelty.Verdict: Dabangg will rock at the box-office. A sureshot and a huge hit!" 
" Awesome movie... A great entertainer","Before watching this film i had doubts about if i am wasting my money on it , but no . The movie is worth it . Very rare bollywood films are liked by me and this is one of them . From start to end its filled with entertainment and those who think it has only meaningless comedy , please refresh your mind and go watch it. Comedy is great and the best thing is its not just about comedy but about relationships . Never expected Arbaaz Khan to direct such a great film , Salman Khan's acting was awesome and as the title says was pretty DABANNG . Sonakshi , daughter of Shatrugan Sinha making her debut through this film . She looks very cute in the film , very lovable . She has a good future aheadOVERALL REVIEW : A must watch . Some of rare great bollywood films ." 
" Dabangg is a disgrace to cinema","This is probably one of the worst Salman Khan movies ever. The movie falls flat in all the departments. The only saving grace is the catchy music and a decent performance from the débutant lead actress. Rest of the actors merely seem to be going through the motions and veterans like Dimple Kapadia and Om Puri are totally wasted.The movie starts with a supposedly big bang action scene, which makes you laugh at the idiocy of the scene. That's the start of the decline for the movie and it never gains any pace or rhythm. The director seems to be confused about whether it's a comedy, thriller or a love story. It's cocktail of all the bollywood masala you can think of, gone horribly wrong. Unless you are die hard Salman Khan fan, expect a headache by the end of the movie." 
" Outstanding Salman.......WoW","Dabangg means fearless. Someone who doesn't care a damn! As much as this film doesn't care a damn for any innovative storyline. As much as Chulbul Pandey tries to hide his tears behind his sunglasses, the film tries to camouflage its conventional storytelling behind Salman's style.Chulbul Pandey (Salman Khan) is a totally fearless but corrupt police officer with unorthodox working methods. He can't stand his stepbrother Makhi (Arbaaz Khan) and detests the dubious Cheedi Singh (Sonu Sood). But when Cheedi tries to put Makhi against Chulbul for his personal gains, the brothers unite to fight back Cheedi.Try to find a novel storyline and there is none in Dabangg. Try to find Salman Khan and there is nothing else." 
" The Legend of Chulbul Pandey!","'Dabangg', 'Dabangg', 'Dabangg', 'Dabangg'.... the most-discussed chat of this week, finally has hit the silver-screen! And fortunately, 'Dabangg' lives up to it's gargantuan expectations!Let me get this straight: 'Dabangg' is no path-breaking, life-changing cinema. It has an outdated story, which worked big time back in the 1980's, but it's presentation & execution is mind-blowing. This one's an out-and-out mass entertainer, with perfect direction, clap-worthy dialouge, Marvelous Action, Meldious Music & Salman like never before! 'Dabangg' starts with a bang, slips in the middle, but picks up big time in the final 30-minutes. The climax is bombastic, it's kick-ass & worth whistling. One more thing that works for this film, is that, it's not a violent experience. It has loads of Action, but there's hardly any bloodshed.Abhinav's direction is perfect. The Screenplay is Mass-Meant, it has Action, Romance, Comedy & little bit Melodrama. Cinematography is satisfactory. Stunts are marvelous. The Music is a chart-buster! In the acting department, Salman is the life of the show. As Chulbul Pandey, he performs fearlessly & leaves you in awe of him. Chulbul Pandey is sure to go down as a legendary character. Sonu Sood is another topper. He excels as the conniving villain. Sonakshi makes a good debut. Dimple is wonderful in a brief role. Arbaaz Khan is decent. Vinod Khanna is able. Om Puri is wasted. Ditto for Anupam Kher. Mahesh Manjrekar is good. Tinnu Anand is effective. Mahi Gill is casual.On the whole, The Legend of Chulbul Pandey is worth your time and money. A Fearless, Thumbs Up!" 
" Dabangg delivers entertainment","Salman was having a no of flops after wanted but in 2010,director Abhinav Kashyap teamed with Salman to give a masala entertainer which changed Salman's career at the box office.Salman became the biggest crowd puller at the box office and even some worst movies like BODYGUARD broke many records at the box office The story of dabangg is very simple.It is about a corrupt police officer who faces challenges from his family, gangsters and politicians.But what made DABANGG stood out was how it was directed.Director Abhinav Kashyap did a fantastic job And what made Dabangg more special is the presence of Salman in an action masala after Wanted.Dabangg was indeed made for Salman.Truly Dabangg is among the best Salman performances.The comedy was also very good.The music "munni badnaam" became an instant hit and had the item girl herself dancing to it.Sonakshi made her debut with Dabangg but had less to do since it is all about the hero All in all DABANGG deserved the success it had at the box office." 
" Best Action blockbuster of the year.","Undoubtedly this is the second best blockbuster of the year. A mind blowing action film with a best performance by Salman.Everseen best action film after a long time which will entertain all ages of the people.The music is fantastic which will make audiences to enjoy the movie to a great extent. The debut actress is also fantastic.The songs are really superb and a musical hit of the year.Truly one of Salman's best action blockbuster ever seen.The plot even old it is good.Surely this film will make a record in India.The debut director has given his best that people who see this movie will become a fan of him.Definitely an awesome action movie which will do a record in all regions." 
" Salman's Spectacular Performancee","9.5 out of 10. This movie was such a good movie that I was totally taken back. I always thought Bollywood films were cheap budget project with 0 action but this movie was totally vice versa. Salman and Soni played their roles so well romantically along with the perfect action execution that was done.This movie contained brotherly love and debate and remains a perfect example of a high quality Bollywood film that would possibly have a chance of being a Hollywood film.I recommend watching this movie no matter what. I mean your watching movies for entertainment right? So, go ahead and enjoy this little flick presented by Salman. Indeed there should be a sequel to this movie. Perhaps even more depending on the next film's performance. Amazing. Just amazing." 
" First time, I enjoyed watching Salman Khan!","I saw this film recently, because of all the hype around the film and breaking 3 Idiots' box office records and I could say for the first time, I enjoyed watching Salman Khan in a 'mass' movie!! :) I watch Telugu/Tamil films a lot and when I say 'mass' movie, I mean like masala (songs, fights, dances, senti-scenes, all that good stuff). It was a difference experience watching a Bollywood star do this kind of film, whereas in South India, there are hundreds of films like this one. But still, DABANGG is the BANGG!! I don't like to watch much of Salman khan's films like MAMK, Yuvvraj, films with David Dhawan, etc but this movie was great to see Salman Khan perform. I know there are a lot of cheezy fight sequences and silly dance steps but it was fun to see Salman in it.Camera work was really good. Nice brown and reds throughout the film..I did not like the camera-work/Artwork of Salman's previous film WANTED because it looked too colorful..these kinds of movies need to bring down the color..Story is very weak but directions takes over. The movie is only 2 hours, 8 min. so definitely no boring scenes..I recommend this film for one and all. Have a Blast!!" 
" best movie so far","all that anyone can say about Dabangg is that this is the best and maybe the perfect movie made this year and believe me you wont regret watching this movie at all,in fact you would love it so much that you would probably want to see it again. Now i can go on writing and jabbering a whole page about it or you could just go and check this movie out. Its an entertainer and you will love the experience since Bollywood goes to Hollywood standards, at least as far as the action scenes are concerned and the best part is that this movie doesn't even have the clichés that one would expect from big budget movies. Salman gives his one of his best performance...so does Sonu Sood! don't listen to naysayers or the haters after all their names speaks for themselves! Its got a refreshing view on action and comedy so go watch this movie and you will be in for a treat if you like action blended with perfect mix of comedy!! perfect score 10/10" 
" Ridiculous","What was this about?? The very fact that the characters have the names of Chulbul and Makhi tells it all. The very first action scene is copied from Transporter but only done many times worse! In fact all the action scenes are more or less like that. 'Wanted' was so much better. Don't know what some of the good actors were doing in there- Om puri, Dimple Kapadia, Vinod Khanna. Only good thing might be the debut of Sonakshi. Nothing more to say. They say it has got a great opening and broken 3 idiots record which is ridiculous. Do today's movies only work on hype??" 
" Total waste of time","My dear Salman and brothers, please quit and do it now ...!!!! After such a ridiculous movie, it comes out very clearly that you people are nowhere close to the class that you once were. Horrible movie / ridiculous story / crappy direction / cheap choreography ....!!! I don't believe that this movie worked at all forget being a big hit. And if it really is, it must be in places like UP / MP / Bihar.....Not in the civilized world. And what is with Malaika doing Item numbers ???? So is old enough to play "MAA" in the daily soaps and these folks are getting her to do Item nos.....HAHAHA !!!High time to stop cheapness in movies and start some class and finesse.... Look at Aamir and learn from him ..... People...once again ....stay away from this one" 
" Outlandish Entertainment!","Due to his hallmark of unorthodox, meaningful and adroitly narrated movies, Anurag Kashyap would've exiled to Rajasthan's deserts to bury his head in shame after watching his younger brother's entertainer-for-the-masses - 'Dabangg'. While the film goes against the tide of new age cinema, it does one thing better than most films. It entertains. With over-the-top sequences, exaggerated circumstances, incredulous action and Salman Khan at its helm, Dabangg not only explodes with its outlandish style to entertain but garners more money than all of Anurag's films combined.One look at Salman's entry in the film and you know what's in store for you. No superhero can walk like him, pack a punch like him or jump over obstacles in one breath. This is Inspector Chulbul Pandey in the hinterland of U.P where the lawless land is a haven for the corrupt. Regardless of his weird mannerisms of placing sunglasses on the back collar, his silly expressions or the brashness under his kindest self, Pandeyji is unmistakably charming. He will tend to let himself loose at times by dancing to Wanted's ring tone that plays on a sidekick's cell phone while he's about to beat the life out of him. Try controlling your laughter at that point. Dabangg draws much of its strength from a screenplay that keeps the action rolling with Salman's presence seldom missed. Witty dialogs in Bhojpuri add the most to the fun element while Salman's rendering of them will leave you craving for more. Director Abhinav Kashyap puts Salman Khan in Rajnikant's shoes in action sequences while the film's setting in U.P gives it a grand scope to explore the bhojpuri realm and take advantage of it for entertainment through dialogs and characters. Although the plot is dead simple, it still has enough juice in it to keep its momentum going with action, romance, comedy and Salman's screen presence. There is something about Salman's performance here that may not necessarily be charismatic but it engages you enough to make you whistle even in a multiplex (although this is totally a G7 or Chandan movie). This is Sunny Deol on drugs and Rajnikant revamped for Bollywood. Dabangg is different from 'Wanted' yet similar in Salman's prowess against adversaries. The music by Sajid-Wajid-Lalit is hummable with Tere Mast Mast and full of masti with Munni Badnaam and Humka Peeni hai. Reminiscent of 'Omkara's title song is Hud Hud Dabangg with excellent cinematography. Salman in all these songs is a charmer and looks to be enjoying the filming completely. There is no choreography. Just some drinks on- the-house. As the unstoppable Macho-man, Salman Khan excels in action sequences. He is, of course known to be stiff and it becomes very apparent while he is dancing but it is fun to watch no doubt, when he lets loose in most songs and just goes wild. Delivering bhojpuri dialogs, threats and romanticism, Salman Khan earns your whistling and hooting. Wanted and Dabangg both would've been catastrophic flops if it weren't for Salman re-inventing himself. Here, he doesn't look like he is out to prove that point. Most of the time, you can see him simply enjoying himself. Arbaaz Khan is passable but could've been sillier to add to the fun as Makhi. Om Puri, Vinod Khanna and Anupam Kher in cameos were superlative while Mahesh Manjrekar delivered a shockingly good performance as a drunkard father. Sonu Sood has been better in 'Jodha Akbar' but he is quite adequate as Chulbul Pandey's adversary. Newcomer Sonakshi Sinha looks beautiful, can put up a straight face pretty well and can compete well against her contemporaries. It goes without saying that Dabangg was never going to be an intellectual enricher. This is pure, flawed entertainment and that is how it needs to be enjoyed. The action seems like a spoof of our southern counterparts and therefore, is fun to watch. Dialogues, however rude at times: 'haraamzade se yaad aaya, aapke sasur kaise hai?' are thoroughly laugh worthy and the sensational cinematography around Salman's entry at various points in the film augments his heroism. Considering these factors, Dabangg offers tremendous value for money and is no surprise that it opened to such an overwhelming response. Nevertheless, this is not going to be a revolution in Bollywood but just a passing tide and it better remain that way. If you have read this all the way and have now decided to go watch it, then it should suffice to say..... "Kamaal karte ho Pandeyji...!" 8.279 on a scale of 1-10." 
" unmatchable","Dabanng, as the name goes meaning fearless, the movie is really fearless in making claims that it will hit the audiences well,and trust me it does so.First of all let me tell you that this is not for those who will like to compare it with WANTED, and this is entirely different,because once you start comparing,you cannot enjoy the movie.. Sallu lives up to the expectations,and the film also delivers it. Sonakshi is a pleasant new face in the industry,packed with good acting skills,reminding us of beautiful old age heroins like madhubala etc. Sonu Sood's Presence made the action sequence at the climax more exciting to watch. all in all movie recceives a thumbs up,and it wont let you down. Full On Clean Entertainment."
