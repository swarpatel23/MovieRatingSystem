" Where are the real gangsters? Hint: Not here!","I am a huge fan of the first movie, which I've seen more than 10 times, and I obviously loved it. It's a shame though that I can't say the same for it's sequel, Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai Dobara.The movie's script feels like an afterthought, like they first decided to cast Akshay Kumar in the role of Shoaib, then thought, okay now what should we do with the character? Even the director and his team knew that the story is extremely flimsy, so they decided to put in as many one liners & punch-packing dialogs as possible.And it would have been better if these dialogs had been any good. They're unintentionally hilarious. I'll talk about that in a while.Everyone in the movie talks like they are at a "mushaira" for dons.They all speak in punchlines, especially Akshay Kumar, who seems to be hamming it up here.And above everything else, they gave so many one liners & punchlines to Imraan Khan, who can't say them right even to save his life, it just makes the matters worse.Talking about Imraan Khan, he does not do the movie any good, he doesn't look the part, doesn't act the part and whatever lines are given to him, he just makes the mess of them.And it's not like that the dialogs are worth remembering, they range from passable to downright hilarious, and not hilarious in an obvious way, but in a way that the film makers had never intended.Take this for an example, Imraan's character actually says this in the movie, (Translating in English because of the site's rules). Love is like a maid, it comes every day, does it's work and then goes away. And it's said in the movie in all seriousness. Unintentional laughter is in abundance here.Akshay overacts, he's always wearing shades & smoking big cigars, &when it comes to dialogs, he just messes it up by trying to act super cool.Imraan, just as always, is pathetic, this guy can't act to save his own life. One of the worst actors of his generation. He doesn't even look like a don in the movie, he looks like a high-society kid trying to mimic a don for a private spoof video.The less said about Sonakshi Sinha, the better. Moving on...The only good things in the movie are some of the action sequences and the small yet powerful turn by Sonali Bendre. She plays her part perfectly, and it was amazing seeing her on the big screen after such a long time. She looks beautiful.I'm going with 3 out of 10 for the movie, an utter & colossal disappointment. I kept waiting for the movie to get better, but it didn't Note to film makers, write a script before you hire someone for the role.Watching this film is like having a prostate exam, you know why you're there, but you don't know why you're really there." 
" Spoiler Alert-Intolerable","With no storyline, no script, bad acting and boring dialogue the movie was doomed to bomb at the box office ab initio.The movie could still have managed to evade this ignominy , had it featured good music. It didn't . The music is bad. It drives you crazy and out of the theatre.The movie , is irritating and comes across as a 80's B-Grade gone real bad .While Gangster movies are past their prime , this one touches new lows.The first few minutes of the movie act as a fitting prologue and only the very brave can venture beyond it. Akshay Kumar's performance is ignorable , stale and dull. Imran Khan is Naturally Unintelligent . Sonakshi misfits in beautifully . There are cheap and childish jokes. Brow beaten and drab one liners. Clichéd depictions of filmy virtues like "Dosti" "Imaandaari" "Namak Ka Farz" etc . There are surreal scenes as well , where, oblivious to the waste disposal systems of the Lavatories on Indian Trains, the characters lie beneath the tracks in search of philosophically charged revelations about life. Please don't waste your time on this one. You won't survive the ordeal ." 
" Loose and lengthy","This time story is partially based on real incidents so too much liberty has been taken to narrate it, movie starts with crime and then gradually takes turn of a typical love triangle movie. Love is not very much established. Few dialogues are good but after a good dialogue you have to bear lots of forced and unnecessarily rhymed dialogues, which left bitter taste eventually. In its first part of series, dialogues were the one of the strongest point of film but in this one, dialogues, screenplay and story all loose the balance. Sometimes over the note sometimes under. There is a good comedy scene between Imran Khan and Sonakshi Sinha, about funny translation of Hindi lines and one misinterpreted word is very catchy but they repeat it so many times that it starts irritating you rather than tickle. Performance wise Akshay Kumar is good. Imran Khan is stiff. Sonakshi Sinha is cute but goes over board in intense emotional scene, especially in climax one. Pitobash, who played the character of Dedh Tang, is impressive. Music of first part of this film was amazing but in this one, it is just okay." 
" totally value for money movie............enjoyable","..movie is really good awesome dialog actor....great acting...nice story good creation of 7o's Mumbai...music is also good...must watch movie looking so classy... khan does his job really good........this film is different from its first part. .... story - One deadly don. One young protégé. Both in love with the same starlet. Who wins the girl in this felonious feat?Once Upon a Time... Bollywood movies were enamored by dreaded D's of the underworld. They still are. Whether the story is told in retro-rap, or with stylish designer double Dons, or with gloss-free rawness of realism. This endless 'lawless' love affair continues. In , a love triangle forms the bloodline of the story, replete with , molls with and an overkill of 'loaded' dialogs dialogs." 
" OUATIMD rides on its dialogues and Akshay Kumar....!!!","Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobara starts with it's superb dialogues and that is the USP of the movie. Through out the movie loads of dialogues will be fired towards you but the good thing is you will enjoy all the dialogues.It's not a complete gangster flick like the previous movie.As shown in the trailer it has its romantic moments & the movie drags sometimes in between those moments. But again the dialogues will keep u occupied. In terms of story line the movie is just fine and could have been better. But it's the performance of the lead actors that will force to overlook the average script. The Retro look of the movie is great & some intelligently directed scenes holds the story together.In terms of acting Akshay Kumar steals the show with the help of some great dialogues. He is great as VILLAIN and shows his versatility as an actor. Sonakshi Sinha does her job quite well and imran khan shines as the HERO of the movie. Supporting characters are also good.Direction of Milan Luthria is good but could have been better.Cinematography is great and the movie bring back the 80's and 90's era quite well.Music is good, though the music of it's prequel had it's own charm. But this one doesn't disappoint either.Overall it's a good movie but it's dialogues and performances(specially of Akshay) makes it a great one.8/10 for me.P.S- watch out for 2 sec guest appearance of Vidya Balan..!!" 
" Wrong Casting, Bad acting , awful directing","The sequel should have had Emraan Hashmi to continue his role, the dialogues suits him better, story should have portrayed more of the 70's feel which was not present.. like in the prequel.. the love story could have run parallel with the underworld maniac and control of power over Mumbai.. which sadly was sidelined. First its marketed as a Gangster/action genre movie but its a romantic movie. Akshay is Great actor no doubt about it but everybody has limitation. Akshay tried his best to be cool as a don but he miserably failed. Akshay could not go to dept of the character wheres Ajay set the bench mark of a don. dialogues were outstanding no doubt! but akshays voice doesn't suits at all. Imran did his well in Romantic scene but as a gangster he never match." 
" Worse","Better wasting 200 Rs Eating at KFc then at this movie. Overacting and lack of performances and not good story line. Go watch Chennai Express Dobara then this.. Akki give me my money back... Critics were right this movie is not worth watching even once. Ekta worry was right because she knew that this film won't make enough in front of Chennai express and today also watched this because Chennai express was houseful and easily got ticket for this one. Ajay devgan, Emran Hasmi and Randeep hooda performances were powerful in first part the main reason behind success of first part. Akshay kumar suits more in comedy then in this type of role." 
" This film needed Ajay Dewgun, better music and a bit of story","This film is advertised as a underworld crime thriller, which it is not, it's a love story.There are no underworld criminal moves or action, minimal story is dragged and Akshay is misfit in this powerful role.Ajay Dewgun from OUATIM 1 is missed. Imran khan goes out of his urban romantic- comedy boy's comfort zone and does good. Sonakshi is there as a beautiful woman for whom 2 gangsters fall and she looks like one. Could be better.High expectations because of Part 1 do no favor to this one.The only enjoyable song from the movie is Javed Bashir's Ye Tune Kya Kita which could've been used better to add that string romantic element much needed but it is not. There is no attempt to highlight the romantic emotions if the gangsters falling for an innocent (read dumb) Kashmiri girl. Similarly, there is little in character of Sonaksho other than her looks and innocence (read stupidity)." 
" If You Love Your Time and Money, Don't Watch This Movie","After Watching Blockbuster Chennai Express I watched OUATIMD and I think that Chennai Express was very good and Ekta Kapoor knew that her Movie cannot fight with Chennai express(nor in Box office, nor in Reviews).Plot: Movies Past Movies Shoaib Khan (Akshay Kumar), with the success of his predecessor, thus earning the respect and honor of Sultan Mirza (Ajay Devgn) as trustee after the murder of his reign ended with the Don, where start with. On the west to the Middle East to extend his empire with charisma and suave man who womanizing skills. The only companions and friends for her illegal and suspicious of their work, love your old time champion (Sonali Bendre) and Aslam (Imran Khan), one of the slums during their visits by Shoaib saw a young where to watch, Javed are the first years of his life he once lived. The only obstacles on the path to supremacy in Mumbai Shoaib Akhtar, Vardha and Arun are two enemies. Sreenu, according to a police officer Shoaib intention to ruin as three Vardha and Arjun joins hands with. The city still rising starlet is her first love, the heart of jasmine choice Shoaib has been caught.Because of the time takes the form of passion and obsession for love jasmine quickly and Shoaib Aslam rift between the two leads. Review: The locations were very hot we have seen the story in many Hindi Movies. Previous OUPATIM was a big success because of great acting by Ajay,Emran and Randeep and Now Akshay's dialogues and not so good and his accent is just not coming from his inside....Ajay was better..Imran Hashmi was better and Randeep was better. In short previous Story was better." 
" watch the first part intead of wasting money and time on this","Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai DobaaraReview:The Movie starts from where Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai had ended.The films begins with Shoaib Khan(Akashya Kumar) picks up a nobody and teaches him the tricks of the trade. 12 years later,Shoaib is the biggest Godfather of Mumbai who handles in all the way from an Arab and the nobody Aslam (Imran Khan) one of his favourites. Then Shoaib comes back to Bombay to nail down all his rivals. Mean while Shoaib meets upon a young actress - Yasmin (Sonakshi Sinha). From the very first meeting shoaib and was completely blown away by her beauty,freshnes. Slowly,Shoaib's attraction becomes an obsession.This results in the ultimate showdown between Shoaib and Aslam (who is supposed to love Yasmin too)Surprisingly None of the actors have done a gud job in the acting department.Both Akshay Kumar,Imran Khan fails to add depths to their characters. Even the one liners fails to make any impact .Music is just about average so as the background score.Cinematography was good.OUATIMD is way below in standards of its prequel .This time Milan Luthria fails as a director and also as a script writer.Editing could have been better.Final Verdict: OUATIMD neither entertain nor bores you. You can easily miss this one and save a few buks.My rating:Acting - 4/10Music - 6/10Direction- 5/10Story - 6/10Overall : 6/10" 
" Welcome the NEW DON to the BTown!","Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai Again - Movie USP are Akshay Kumar and dialogues. Movie is a love triangle with lots of Action and super thrill. Background music is killer, and Cinematography is way too good, and the best part is it's climax. As people were saying that Imraan Khan would not suit in his role, but guess what, he totally does justice, his best performance till date. Sonakshi Sinha is very good in the film.But AKKI, he steals the show in every moment he is on the screen. His badness makes you clap. Welcome the new BAD in BTown. I don't know why some critics gave it a 2 or 2.5 star rating, they gave some senseless, very BAD films a 4 or 4.5 star rating. But Film-makers don't make films for critics, they make films for audiences and this film totally makes audience laugh, thrill, shout, clap, emotional. Film has some loose moment but can be ignored.Overall, one of the best romantic thriller films, Bollywood has ever produced. And please don't compare it with it's prequel, that had a way different genre. THIS TIME IT'S PERSONAL. Go for Akshay's performance, a breathtaking climax, stunning BG score, Performances and The Director's (MILAN LUTHRIA) vision." 
" Mediocre Sequel","Milan Luthria's sequel to the classic movie is a big let down. While the 2010 original was awesome, this one is mediocre at best. Ajay Devgn was perfect in his larger than life role. However, it was Emraan Hashmi who immortalized the movie. He broke his stereotype serial kisser image and emerged a winner as the deadly don. Coming back to this movie. The key problem in this movie is everyone's trying so hard to be cool, that it doesn't work. Akshay Kumar lacks the charisma of Emraan Hashmi. He delivers some really cool dialogs, but you can't help but wonder if he's actually Rowdy Rathore and not Shoaib! Yup, his dialog delivery is exactly the same as it was in Rowdy Rathore. Imran Khan as Aslam is a dud. I really couldn't understand why the director took him in first place. Sonakshi couldn't reprise the charm she displayed in Lootera.Now for the good parts of the movie. Dialogues are really cool. More than half of them doesn't make sense, but are nevertheless very cool. And the beginning & climax of the movie are awesome. They more than make up for the lack of substance in between. I particularly liked the the scene where Imran and Akshay are jumping from roof to roof. Another bonus is Sonali Bendre. She gives a better performance than the rest of the crew combined. All in all, it's a total time-pass movie. Cool dialogs will make it bearable for you to watch the movie. If only the director had poured in more substance, and actors displayed a more subtle coolness, the movie would have worked wonders. Better to wait 2 months and watch on Sony or Star TV" 
" superb, but only for a few moments....","Once upon a time in mumbai dobara is a much anticipated sequel to 2010 movie Once upon a time in mumbai...Akshay Kumar carries forward the role of Shoaib,the underworld don and the movie depicts his love story and the characters circumspecting it...Despite being sequel to Once upon a time in mumbai, which was a pure gangster flick, this movie has a completely romantic feel and hence you will be disappointed if you enter the theater with an expectation of this being like the previous one...To begin with story and screenplay are the most crucial factor in any movie...and this movie does not live up-to that factor sincerely.But given so, it begins on a high note and ends on a high note as well...The climax just makes you overlook the lack of substance in the middle...The love story is as redundant as it can get with nothing new...In short, the opening and ending of the movie compensate the sluggish middle part...As far as acting goes, Akshay Kumar as Don looks good but at times his accent doesn't go with the character he is playing, but eventually his performance is good and he looks brutal in some scenes.Imran Khan fails to impress and again is not suitable for this kind of role, while Sonakshi Sinha looks decent.The supporting cast is just not good enough...What makes this movie worth watching is the dialogs, especially by Akshay Kumar and incredible background score...its one of the best in years in bollywood...This movie would have been much better had it been a mixture of love story and crime, apart from just being personal...Nevertheless, good narration, dialogs, Akshay's acting and unbelievable background music makes your money count and can be watched once..." 
" Awesome movie","BLOCKBUSTER OF 2013...MUST WATCH Full entertainment with family Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai Again - Movie USP are Akshay Kumar and dialogues. Movie is a love triangle with lots of Action and super thrill. Background music is killer, and Cinematography is way too good, and the best part is it's climax. As people were saying that Imraan Khan would not suit in his role, but guess what, he totally does justice, his best performance till date. Sonakshi Sinha is very good in the film dialogues and performances(specially of Akshay) makes it a great one.10/10 for me.Overall, one of the best romantic thriller films, Bollywood has ever produced" 
" Smashing!","In Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai Dobara, a love triangle forms the bloodline of the story, replete with 'donnisms', molls with maal and an overkill of 'loaded' dialogues pe dialogues.This is a love story of a gangster, it does not reopen dons' crime diaries. The first part is more engaging; thereon, the sluggish pace lacks the same dumb. The heavy-duty dialogues (Rajat Aroraa) punch drama in the story, though at times too overbearing. More than anything else in Milan Luthria's sequel, Akshay towers. He chews up the scenery with his dangerous frown, flaring nostrils, dark glasses, flicked cigarettes and thunderous dialogue. Yes, the film is over-wrought, melodramatic and designed as pulp fiction. But it's also fun! It had me cheering for the bad guy. Which, at least in the movies, is never a bad thing. I'm going with four stars. One star is for Akshay Kumar who makes a stellar killer."
