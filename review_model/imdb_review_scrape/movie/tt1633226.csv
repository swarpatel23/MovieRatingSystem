" Superbly directed film that is highly entertaining & with a superb cast of notable actors.","I have seen this film about 3-4 times now. The reason being as I said earlier: the to-the-point direction, excellent script and decent cast.The background music, and the few songs in the film complement the film.The big name actor in this film is Jackie Shroff. Other notable actors are: Samir Aftab, Akhilendra Mishra, Yashpal Sharma, Sushant Singh & Avtar Gill. Vishwajeet Pradhan makes a very short cameo appearance.Plot: Mumbai-based CEO of Channel X, Jaikishan Shroff, who has conducted a number of sting operations, finally acquires some hard evidence in the form of a hidden camera video recording done by some members of his staff.The recording, if got into the hands of the Police, would unravel the mystery of an elusive underworld gangster: Musaa. However Shroff doesn't know the location of the tape, as it was secretly stashed by a member of his staff before her demise at the hands of some Musaa's henchmen.Unaware to Shroff also is that Musaa has recruited some men to recover that very video recording....Watch this excellent and highly recommended film. Better still, BUY it for your DVD collection."
