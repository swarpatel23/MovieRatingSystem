" Confused Hollow Romance","This is a movie that unwittingly exemplifies Shakespeare's quote "What's in a Name?". For the movie has nothing to do with it's name which means "Pure Traditional Romance". The length and breadth of small town Indian cities are beautifully captured by the cinematographer and Director of Photography, yes but the path traversed by the central characters is anything but pure - but more of that later. Neither is this a romantic film, unless of course you think of hardcore lust and hormonal desires as romance. I don't. Period. And finally, the only thing traditional about the characters are their names "Raghupati Rajaram", "Gayatri", "Tara" etc.Talking of tradition, films are either a reflection of society, or a mirror to society. The mostly one dimensional and shallow characters ensures the mirror is cracked from side to side, and even if for a moment, you think of the things being shown in the movie about small towns, to be a reflection of society, let me request you to get in touch with an ophthalmologist.In this film Sushant Singh Rajput (and many others around him) at numerous places refer to Parineeti Chopra as a sister/elder sister, etc and yet indulges in a no holds barred live in relationship with her. Characters run away from their own marriage multiple times - in fact repeating their same actions over and over again. Even minor characters are unnecessarily shown to indulge in confused sexual flings with random strangers and that too in their wedding trousseau! All this to try and showcase "Live In Relationships" to be the future alternative to marriages in India. Even children are not spared and hinted at being just as confused about marriage! A girl left high and dry at her own wedding surprisingly once again enters the life of her once husband to be (after a calculated absence of course!) and then gets into a sexual relationship with him, for the flimsiest of reasons! All the while, his heart - sorry - libido - still beats for the girl he once left at their wedding, oops! sorry! I mean the girl who left him at their wedding! No wait! the girl who he thought was someone else, but realizes is like the girl who he thought she was never like who he met at what was to be his wedding! Trust me - even I am confused! Equally confused it appears to be are the girls themselves. They are strangely never jealous of each other, often behaving like a much in love mother and daughter, or even soul sisters for reasons impossible to fathom while indulging in bane banter and sipping Coca Colas!At a time when it looks like we are about to finally witness a Bollywood film showing a 'menage-a-troys', one of the heroines walk out of the twisted relationship making way for the rest to decide to get married, only to once again, run away from each other. The film ends with two of the three characters using closed doors as a metaphor for marriage and deciding to stay happily ever after with the doors carelessly open. An open relationship anyone? Go figure!This is a story that could have unfolded with passion playing out like a roost of chickens to some well placed grain. Yet, strangely, in spite of numerous kisses (27-35, I really stopped counting every time someone was near a filthy toilet), this film has hardly done justice to what could have otherwise been a blockbuster script. Trust me - if this script finds its way to a maker of x-rated films, "Deep Throat" would no longer be able to hold its sway as the greatest x-rated movie of all time.Talking of which, time and again the reasons provided for the characters to exhibit their odd idiosyncrasies are mostly pathetic and defies logic causing some really good performances by Sushant (good, though often confusing), Parineeti (excellent and uninhibited), Rishi Kapoor (superb and sane), and Vaani (a debut that shows glimpses of talent despite a paper thin characterization) to be as wasted as its beautiful musical score and realistic witty dialogs. A classic case of rhyme without reason leading to the viewer in me screaming treason. In short this is an extraordinary film, because ordinarily, the director and writer have exhibited much better talent earlier (writer - Chak De India, Director - Band Baaja Baraat). If you think of this film as a perfect romantic film to watch with your special someone, prepare to have your senses assaulted. If you are planing to watch this film with your family, prepare to get embarrassed beyond relief. If you wish to watch this film with a group of friends or colleagues, prepare to get set for some unnecessary debates.This is the perfect example of what overconfidence can do to a bundle of talent and the lack of a cohesive script. Please do yourselves a favor and watch a Sunny Leone film instead." 
" Shudh Confused Hormones","It was not Shudh Desi because 1- We don't need rental baratis and we have families to join in marriage functions. 2- Girls don't kiss passionately in first meeting and get ready to have sex and live without marriage. 3- Men are not "harami" to this limit ( mostly ) who so readily leave a girl at such moments. Usually men are honorable and have their pride. 4- Marriage and Family is not considered as being living in locked room. 5- Children are taught to respect relations. It was not romance because 1- Romance is not about running away from marriage. 2- Romance is not about having kisses ( meaninglessly ) and sleeping with every girl. 3- Romance is not about being in constant state of confusion that should I be with person whom I am with. 4- Romance is not about being insecure towards long term relationship. Yash chopra soul should be pulling his hair ( as hopefully souls are young and supposed to have hair )after this movie. Aditya chopra and whoever is the director of this movie should be ashamed of themselves for disrespecting Indian values. And last but not the least, I am Pakstiani and admire Indian cinema and I am sure that love and related values have not gone this low in India." 
" Fresh, entertaining and extra points for an attempt to break the orthodox.","Yes, the storyline is rather fidgety. But since when did we become so staunch about the storyline from movies under Yash Raj Films banner? Acting is above average, Rishi Kapoor tops the list, of course. No surprises there. The script is entertaining and funny. Well, more often than not.But the 7 / 10 is mostly because of the statement or the point that this movie tried to make about marriages in India. And even amidst the inconsistency of the movie, there is enough food for thought for this generation and for the country as a whole.As India slowly turns into an epitome of hypocrisy as a country, I have a feeling that this movie won't be acceptable by the average Indian audience though there is no sex or foreplay as such. But hey, curvy girls in bikinis running on the beach in some Salman Khan movie is just fine! As long as there is objectification.There are however both sexual and non-sexual peeves (for the Indian audience) thrown all over the movie and I found them brilliant as well as hilarious. Go ahead, take your family to this movie. Make them a little uncomfortable and be a little uncomfortable as well. Monkeys make out, we do too. It's okay! For once, don't judge.Bottomline: Definitely entertaining. Definitely funny. Yes, it is a little mindless and the story wanders off at times. But it's worth the watch!" 
" Charming Rom-Com","Sometimes we don't want to go for a movie to think about social issues,follow very complicated plots or enjoy super action scenes;sometimes we want to simply relax,forget everything and laugh out our worries in those 2.5 hours;"Suddh Deshi Romance" is one such movie - it is full of fun and laughter backed by power-packed,sweet and naughty performances and few nice songs around small town beautiful city Jaipur. It also depicts the current youth's dilemma about life long commitment. Rishi Kapoor in a special character was awesome, Sushant was brilliant, both the heroines(Parineeti and Vani) had done their parts beautifully though Parineeti had major on screen presence. Giving away anything more about the story will be gross injustice to this charming rom-com,Go,laugh,Relax and Enjoy with your friends and family." 
" Shuddh? Slightly. Desi? Noticeably. Romance? Absolutely. â™¦ 44%","There's SOMETHING about this movie which is appealing. Some sequences are so alluring, it revs up your enthusiasm but some sequences shut them down permanently erasing the previously hatched-up zeal. Shuddh Desi Romance is thus an experimental coming-of-age flick which is laudable for its virility, but easily forgettable due to its monotony (and/or mindlessness).Sushanth Sigh Rajput's character is that of a recital bachelor who has some authenticity instilled into it. While on the other hand, the women's characters play see-saw here. Parineeti Chopra is, in her usual air, dashing, but I am not that impressed with the newcomer's acting. Rishi Kapoor completes the humor part.The plot is funny at times, serious in many nodes & significantly pragmatic throughout the narration. The individual shots of the three main leads in-between the average screenplay is one annoying thing collectively. Entertainment is delivered, but sporadically. Unless & until the viewer is prepared to dig deep inside the plot & carve him/herself to be comfy with the on screen steamy scenes, he/she wouldn't have enough food for thought. Otherwise, SDR talks something serious & relevant for the current generation.To sum it all up, a statement in the movie "Has the idea of marriage befallen?" truly is one lovable thing about the rather emotional movie.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for love-birds to watch together. Lively songs & made-up dialogs altogether is a fine piece. Older generations (which doesn't include YOLO) could stay away. 4.4 out of 10 from a guy who is in his 20s and is solely rated so due to the high-octane romance. It is lite, and high on romance. Ignore the slow-downs & consider the potential. Not recommended for a theater-watch, although.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity: Mild | Mouth-Kiss: Strong | Sex/Foreplay: No | Violence/Gore: No | Porn/Drugs: No | Smoking/Alcohol: Mediocre" 
" Fun colorful film about colorful people","Loved this movie ! It's a rare gem that portrays humor so intelligently and spins a tale about romance in modern day middle class India. The characters are so well etched that the story unfolds in a very smooth organic manner without sudden awkward jerks.It's an under appreciated film and I give it a 9 if only to improve the film's ratings. If only more films were such subtle intelligent romantic comedies. I found the story and characterization so engrossing, that I imagine others like myself would root for the protagonist, Raghu, and shake their head knowingly at the inevitable outcomes as the three characters play out.My favorite character would have to be Raghu, the commitmemt phobic, confused lover, who loves deeply and is stuck between two women both of whom seem to have some power over him. My second favorite has to be Gayathri, the woman who lives by her own terms, fronts a bold attitude but is every bit a sensitive girl on the inside. She matches Raghu in commitment phobia.One mistake I find reviewers making is confusing the entertainment quotient of the film with their view of Indian morality.Very likely that an inexperienced film viewer who abhors 'western influence' will appreciate a film. This may or may not be warranted depending on the seriousness of the film. But this movie isn't a serious documentary or a social commentary on the state of relationships these days. Rather this is a light hearted film, a romantic comedy with no hidden message or agenda. Enjoy the film for what it is - a merry go round of the jilted, the commitment phobic and the love struck." 
" Shuddh Desi Romance is neither SHUDDH DESI nor ROMANTIC..!!","i had a really high expectation from this movie considering the promos, cast, music and directer (pretty much everything about the movie was good enough to create a high expectation). But the movie is really far below my expectations. Story line falls apart in the movie and in the climax you will feel that this is a rare mindless romantic movie in bollywood !!!There is not a single moment in the movie which is truly enjoyable apart from couple of songs !!First of all, this movie is about or what the director tries to portray is how young Indian generation reacts to live-in-relationship. In the movie the relationship triangle between the three main leads develops quite well but fails to sustain when the relationship turns to marriage and GOD knows why it turns towards marriage.There is too much bathroom scenes in the movie which are it's milestones but they are not quite enjoyable. The story messes up between these relations and in the end lives you with nothing.Secondly, the so called romance between the three main leads are being shown with the help of a lot of kiss scenes and bathroom scenes !!! there is not a single heart touching romantic moment in the movie. Bollywood is famous for it's mindless masala movies but it's a quite rare mindless romantic movie in bollywood. The movie is based on three youngsters from Rajasthan but it failed to show the beauty of some great cities of Rajasthan.In terms of acting Sushant, Parineeti and Vani, all plays their character really well but the problem is their characters are not given justice in the movie. Hence despite some good acting they fail to provide some quality entertainment. Rishi Kapoor as a supporting cast, also has an average performance.Direction is pretty bad and way below expectation. The director tries to portray the live-in-relation issue in Shuddh Desi style but he fails badly to do so.Music is the only good part of the movie. Gulaabi and the title song are really good.Cinematography is strictly average and fails to present the beauty of Jaipur.so on the whole it is a big disappointment for me and i even doubt that it's a one time watch or not.3/10 for me..!!P.S- if u want to watch Dhoom 3 teaser on the big screen then only go for this one !!!" 
" People fall in and out of love or marriage mandaps too easily","People fall in and out of love too easily. Change their mind about marriage too conveniently. I understand promiscuity but this is a different level of flippancy. You also don't get what's it about Sushant that he gets too fairly hot women to lust for him. Sushant Singh runs away from one marriage, from the actual jai-mala stage. Because he is not sure. Neither are we about why he runs away. He seems like a typical, dil-phenkh, sadak- chhaap boy, nothing memorable about him, not much to look at either. But first Parineeti falls for him. Then Vaani Kapoor, the girl he had left at the Hindu equivalent of the altar, also does so. Cue a couple more escapes from weddings and you wonder what the hell is going onÂ…The only character who remains consistent, understandable is Rishi Kapoor. A man who employs both Sushant and Parineeti as fake baraati's and otherwise runs a wedding catering / baraat business. His advice, concern for the three leads remains genuine. And even though there are plenty of 'I love you's', kisses and sex, not once do you feel anything is real or heart- feltÂ…which kind of allows the whole movie to pass you by as well, without any regard for its leads. Some of the jokes are funny. The rustic touches are good, the atmosphere, small-town feel works and the performances sincere. Pity you just don't agree with either the overall plot or the characters created." 
" It could have been a little more Shuddh and a little more Desi !!","Shuddh Desi Romance: Till Interval, it is one of the most apt real life interpretation of modern day relationships !!! After Interval, it reminded me of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag as the groom was running from 1st bride, 2nd bride was running from groom, 1st bride and 2nd bride were having a fag together . After that 2nd bride and the groom runs once again. All because they didn't want Rishi Kapoor's business to prosper. Well that was only the logical explanation i could come up with. The saving grace in the film were the background score and Rishi Kapoor's acting. Sushant meant business in this film as well after Kai Po Che. Parineeta is the perfect replacement of Kajol in Bollywood as the girl next door. Vaani kapoor is nothing more than being an eye candy in the film throwing the same expression over and over again. The plot left a lot to be desired and the climax should have been more conclusive. You can't just repeat the same situations in mere circles in the same movie with only changing characters humming the same set of dialogues. Last word: It could have been a little more Shuddh and a little more Desi !!" 
" Fresh but shallow","Director Mr. Maneesh Sharma work is good. He has taken the movie ahead from the script. Script is written by Jaideep Sahni, and it is average. Story line is new but very thin. Scenes are fresh but they get slow very often, especially in second half. Dialogues are good. Actually, what has been shown in promo and trailer, is undoubtedly best part of film. All characters in the film are somewhere underplayed and somewhere exaggerated. There are very few scenes which succeed to touch the heart, actually it just pat the heart and then move away. The main emotion in this love story is the confusion of characters, rather than love, so they reflect fake at the places. It is difficult to relate with any one of them completely. Look of the film and approach towards every scene is new. Director of photography, Manu Anand work is impressive. Performance wise Sushant Singh Rajput as Raghu, is natural and good. Parineeti Chopra as Gayetri, is fine. Vaani Kapoor as Tara, is impressive, especially her cute smile, which she used in max of the scenes. Rishi Kapoor is on the top. Fine actor Rajesh Sharma as Mausa ji , is wasted. Music by Sachin Jigar is good, title track is very good." 
" A waste of time","It really is a romance with a mindless story. There was nothing in the movie which was enjoyable except some intimate scenes which might entertain some. The lead character appeared to be a psycho who has a phobia towards marriage but gets infatuated by beautiful ladies.It just appeared as if the movie revolves around a middle class house,some toilets and the psychic attitude of the actor.You can not watch this movie with your family as it has a lot of intimate scenes. Old generation will definitely hate this movie where love birds may like it.All the movie portray is how young generation of India are preferring to be in a living-together relationship than getting married. Too much of bathroom scenes,trying to make some situations comic has left the movie as a joke. The movie is far behind my expectation and leaves me with disappointment.I would not recommend others to watch this movie. It is a big waste of time and money.Bollywood should not produce such films.My rating - 2/10" 
" Its confusingly irritating climax, sadly ruins a winning build up.","Admittedly, the most important name in SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE was not Parineeti, Sushant or Maneesh but Jaideep Sahni for me, since I really love the way he writes his films with a rare realistic texture and simplicity. However after watching it in an almost full theater of mostly college students, I was somehow disappointed 'in the end' since the film neither had anything Pure (Shuddh) or Tratitional (Desi) nor truly Romantic in its 140 minutes of content, revolving around Live-In relationships to be precise. So since the main focus of the film was all around casual flirting, pre-marital sex and live in relationships, I strongly felt the title of the film just opposite to its concept as SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE very frankly.Besides, this is the first time ever that I felt the writing of Jaideep Sahni (Story, Screenplay, Dialogues & Lyrics) very confusing and unconvincing with every single character of his, not exactly knowing what he/she really wants in his/her life and who do they love from their heart seriously. But fortunately, a viewer gets to think all this in a negative mode, only when the film reaches in its last 30 minutes and not before that.Therefore, the good news is that till the complexities between its three leading characters reach their concluding moments, the viewers have nothing to complain at all as far as entertainment is concerned. And the film undoubtedly remains a fairly enjoyable venture both before and after the intermission with many entertaining sequences & dialogues to keep you glued. But once it reaches the finale, all the fine build simply crashes down with some absurd decisions taken by its characters and a very weird kind of conclusion is there promoting an entirely different concept of the present society (i.e. the live in relationships) which is certainly not any SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE as they have named it.So if you are just interested in having a good time in the theater, laughing at all the unjustified & highly unrealistic kind of scenes, wherein everyone is behaving in a confused or weird manner, then SDR might interest you a lot since it is exactly packaged to provide the same. It has some great intimate kisses, many hilarious dialogues in a local lingo and some good performances too. But in case you are interested in watching an exceptional love story with a deep emotional base supported by a realistic logic then you might get disappointed like myself as the end credits start rolling.Having said that, the smart thing about the film is, that it actually never makes you feel the absurdity till the last few minutes. And its only when the film is over, that you are forced to think "Yaar, Yeh Hua Kya?", followed by more questions about the entire storyline which have no logical answers at all in the film itself. For instance, a young man runs away from his marriage's mandap just before the "Jai-mala" and knowing it, the immensely beautiful bride takes it very casually and asks for a Thanda instead! Now there are many more similar sequences in the film which certainly have no realistic reasoning behind them, not expected from a project written by Jaideep Sahni. But maybe this time the writer and his director were more interested in making the people laugh on these absurdities only, quite intentionally for a change.Anyway, though its basic plot is just the same (of confused partners), the film is still presented in a highly likable manner and I too enjoyed it a lot in its initial hour. But towards the final half an hour, the interest was all lost, leading to an utterly confused conclusion, supported by no reason at all. Actually SDR keeps progressing at a very calm pace without any peaks of excitement in the script. Yet it majorly keeps you entertained because of the loving chemistry between its three charming characters and their natural performances. As a strong merit, there are no dull moments in the film at all with many hilarious dialogues in its initial 90 minutes. Still at times one might think that there is too much talking going on instead of Pure Romance in a repetitive mode. Musically SDR has some good tracks but also has a signature tune in the background music exactly similar to the notes of "Kiklee Kaleer Di" from LUV SHUV TE CHICKEN KHURANA. Thankfully the songs don't come into the narration abruptly, which is another saving grace of the film and Cinematography also provides a good support capturing the local feel brilliantly.In performances, Sushant Singh is remarkably natural and impresses once again post KAI PO CHE!. He is fresh in looks and gets some great lines to woo the audience too.Parineeti Chopra is fine with another of her 'bindaas, spontaneous' performance playing the bold & beautiful. She is no doubt good but now needs to move on, away from her typical 'Carefree' persona displaying some different acting skills in her next projects. Rishi Kapoor is lovable as usual and Rajesh Sharma does it well once again. But the surprise element in the film is Vaani Kapoor who looks stunningly gorgeous and amazingly confident in her very first performance on screen and could have made much more impact with a better role written for her (having some logical reasoning).To sum it up, SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE is a young film at heart particularly aiming at the youngsters with many light, entertaining moments to win over them smartly (overstepping the Indian traditional setting of a marriage). It could have been a great film, if it had a more logical conclusion given to the 3 confused characters in the final reels. But in the present form, it has a winning build-up, the impact of which gets more or less ruined by a weird and irritating climax quite surprisingly." 
" Suddh Desi Romantic-Comedy-Drama",""Shuddh Desi Romance" is one of those films that appear to be the part of present day romantic fantasies and also, the part of the satire on those fantasies as well as the whole institution of marriage. A fairly good concoction of 'masala' with quite rustic yet genuine humour, this "romantic-dramedy" proves to be a fairly compact entertainer. The storyline is the most complex feature of the film, but surely the most engaging one as well. A simpleton yet romantically ambitious guide (Sushant Singh Rajput) who is not sure about settling down, a street-smart yet emotional English teacher (Parineeti Chopra) who attends weddings as a "baraati" to add influence in exchange of subsidiary income, a homely yet smart girl (Vaani Kapoor) though left at the altar knows how to avenge herself â€“ cross paths, one-by-one with one another. All have one thing in common â€“ "marital bond and related hitches". What happens next is what they (and most of the young generation) relate to as (Shuddh Desi...) "romance". The plot is rich with clichÃ©s related to the marital system, the double-standards of the society and also the bewildered mentality of the youth due to which they're willing to do everything that couples could engage in except for getting married. The best performer was Parineeti, hands down. Sushant was very natural and rustic along with Rishi Kapoor. Debutante Vaani seemed like a rookie in the beginning but handled her part well and looked very pretty. Screenwriter-Lyricist Jaideep Sahni, with well written sequences having symbolic iterations and spot on word-exchanges, has added another feather to his cap after "Khosla Ka Ghosla" and "Chak De India". Other strong aspects have been direction (Maneesh Sharma; 'Band Baaja Baraat') and casting (Shanoo Sharma) both adding a lot of flavour to the already well cooked and steaming recipe. The editing was crisp (Namrata Rao; 'Kahaani') with one of the distinct features being "breaking of the fourth wall" (speaking directly to the viewers) were placed imaginatively. The music of the film was handled by the lesser known Sachin-Jigar, who did a decent work with the front runners as - the song of about romance in the 'Pink City' - "Gulabi" that was the most well presented one in the film, and "Chanchal Mann Ati Random".The film may seem like an independent sequel to "Band Baaja Baraat" with a story though heard by many, but not yet seen this way. A good watch!" 
" This is Love Actually <3","For years Hindi movies have drilled the same conservative, and often regressive notions of love and marriage into our heads. Shuddh Desi Romance takes that conventional wisdom propagated to us in the movies and turns it on its head. What's worth noting is that this movie comes from the stable of Yash Raj Films, the very studio largely responsible for breeding those notions through hits like Chandni, Dil To Pagal Hai and Bachna Ae Haseeno among others.Directed by Band Baaja Baraat's Maneesh Sharma and written by Chak De India's Jaideep Sahni, Shuddh Desi Romance is set amidst the bustle of middle-class Jaipur, where unemployed youngsters will happily pose as friends and cousins in a traveling baraat for a few thousand rupees and a gold chain. When he isn't conning white tourists into buying handicrafts from local merchants for a commission, Raghu (Sushant Singh Rajput) is busy falling in love. But he goes from sincere to conflicted to selfish in as long as it takes most people to change out of a wedding suit. So he'll woo a girl, win her heart, then develop cold feet at the mandap. This happens thrice in Shuddh Desi Romance, which would be tiring and largely predictable if it weren't for Sahni's crackling dialogue and the charming characters he puts on screen. Gayatri (Parineeti Chopra) is a gregarious rebel Raghu meets on the way to his own wedding. She smokes, she's had boyfriends, and she lets Raghu move in with her when he ditches his shaadi. Tara (newcomer Vaani Kapoor) is the damsel who springs a surprise on both Raghu and the audience.Like most normal couples â€“ hence, unlike the relationships we see in Hindi movies â€“ sexual attraction is key to our protagonists' equation, and the film doesn't make a big deal about it. In fact, to give credit where it's due, Sahni's script never screams from the rooftops about the brave ideas it pushes so matter-of-factly. Skillfully avoiding melodrama or sloganeering, the film portrays a generation where single women can live in with their boyfriends without being banished by the housing society. This is a refreshingly real middle-class India where marriage needn't be life's sole ambition for young girls, and where women can hold their heads high and carry on with life despite having been ditched at the altar.There's so much to like about Shuddh Desi Romance, including Sharma's nicely textured portrait of the Pink City. The film captures the sights and sounds of a busy metro in ways that most films don't even try. Oblivious that he's ruined someone's appetite, a cook at a jalebi stall scratches his backside with a chhanni. It's little details like these that sparkle with originality.Pity then that the movie runs out of steam in its unconvincing final act, particularly during a confrontation between the two leading ladies that comes off as contrived. In other complaints, the talking-into-camera device is now overused, and seldom works unless what's being said is profound, which isn't always the case here. This in fact, adds to the film's already verbose and occasionally repetitive feel.What cannot be faulted, however, are the terrific performances from the central players. Vaani Kapoor makes an auspicious debut, carrying off Sahni's firecracker lines with the comfort of a pro. Sushant Singh Rajput as Raghu, has an easy charm about him and unmistakable depth behind that scruffy exterior. But it's Parineeti Chopra, reminiscent of a younger Rani Mukherjee, who this film belongs to. She has expressive eyes and an endearing manner about her, and turns Gayatri into the most real woman you've encountered on screen recently. The film also benefits enormously from the casting of an excellent Rishi Kapoor in the part of a feisty wedding caterer and Raghu's father figure.To a large extent, Shuddh Desi Romance reinvents the wheel as far as Bollywood rom-coms go. It's aggressively non-formulaic, and gives us characters who refuse to conform. The minor hiccups notwithstanding, this is a charming little film. I'm going with eight ratings. You'll enjoy it." 
" Terribly Executed Movie....!!!!!","Shuddh Desi Romance is directed by the Band Baaja Baaraat fame Maneesh Sharma....To have made a excellent first film it is a terrible movie to made.. Story,Screenplay and Dialogues are by Jaideep Sahni who had written films like Company, Khosla ka Ghosla, Chak De India has written a reasonably fresh script but it lacks execution and the screenplay is somehow confusing. It is bit hard to accept he has written this story so randomly.Cinematography by Manu Anand is strictly mediocre. The beauty of the Jaipur city is wasted as he doesn't capture anything beautiful in his camera...Sets by Rashmi Sethi is just about okay. Nothing to cheer about..Performance: Sushant Singh Rajput after his stiller performance in Kai Po Che is just about okay. He has not been near to his previous performance. Parineeti Chopra is born to act. She is just fantastic in whatever she get in the movie. Vaani Kapoor is very confident and definitely a good future ahead. He has done reasonably well for his first film.. Rishi Kapoor , well nothing to tell about him. He is just like wine, getting better with age. Excellent performance by his again followed by his sheer genius act in D-Day....Direction: Maneesh Sharma's direction is very ordinary. He has just made any film because he had to. Very randomly made film which contributes nothing accept a few good performances..My rating is 4/10. Last word is strictly avoid it. If you have a lot of money to waste you can go for it..." 
" Shudh Desi -Pure NonSense","It had been long since I had waited so eagerly for any Hindi movie after Dirty Picture. Hence, my expectations were high to begin with but I was not only thoroughly disappointed but in despair.The movie has a promising start and that's all there is to it. It gives one a feeling that the director just had about 2 scenes and 4 dialogues and these were repeated every now and then, by the end you feel like just getting up and leaving. To summaries the plot:Sushant runs away from Vaani(during their wedding), Parineeti runs from her wedding with Sushant, Vaani runs from Sushant, Sushant and Parineeti run away from their wedding!!!!!There is no plot, no character development, no romance(yes I mean- 27 smooches and not even one seems to be genuine or manages to sizzle), the bedroom scenes between Sushant and Parineeti are utterly unbelievable and awkward and no logic what so ever.Please spare yourself the torture and run as far as possible from this one!"
