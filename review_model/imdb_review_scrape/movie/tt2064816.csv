" Not the BEST, but definitely deserves a SHELF-LINE...","The movie is crisp..short (95 minutes)..bright..feel-good and most importantly justifies the title and delivers what was expected of it.I am more inclined towards the 'redeeming movies' (as I call them) where you have to leave your popcorn aside and stay focused in the movie and also where the main lead realizes and redeems himself..movies like INTO THE WILD (2007), WAKE UP SID (2009), ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA (2011), and now I, ME AUR MAIN (2013) are some of the films which fall into that category for me.BRIEF STORY & CHARACTER SKETCHStory is about a guy Ishaan (John Abraham) who is engrossed in self, corpuscular, egocentric, self-centered, inconsiderate, narcissistic, unconcerned and spoiled brat and music producer, who never values anyone or anything above him. Her live-in girlfriend Anushka (Chitrangda Singh) who loves him blindly but does not like the attitude of Ishaan towards his life and responsibilities. His mom (Zarina Wahab) is a supportive mother who is dealing with her decisions she took years back and is inclined towards Ishaan. She can be seen supporting him when he was only a kid in the first scene of the movie itself. He meets a girl Gauri (Prachi Desai), who helps him feel n realize the value of relations, the mishaps with her girlfriend makes him responsible and focused, and an incident with her mother towards the end of the movie makes him cognizant about his own self, and with all this he realizes where he is leading with his bright, cheerful, colorful yet monotonous life, that encounter with his mother helps Ishaan meet his real own self, helps an embryonic man-child to take charge of his so far in-vain life. And all of these factors and mishaps in his life helps him to become mature, focused, serious, principled, responsible towards his life and relations making him eventually a better person as a whole.OVERVIEWIts Kapil Sharma's debut attempt and I must say that he made a decent start. The movie could have been better in terms of acting and the level of emotions it was trying to convey. The direction was fresh and effective. The story was one of the best thing in the movie which was penned by Devika Bhagat who had also written earlier marvelous screenplay for BACHNA AE HASEENO (2008) and helped director Navdeep Singh in the story/screenplay for the cult MANORAMA SIX FEET UNDER (2007). Talking about the music, its fresh but could have been better to let the viewers feel the crunch of the matter. The best part is the length of the movie which is only 95 minutes and you see a whole journey of a guy from ignorance to cognition. The only flaw is that the screenplay missed several emotions which the story demanded and many of them were also skipped just to make a short-duration movie. The movie lacks stability and loses the interest as well in parts but Kapil Sharma tries hard to bind it together, though unsuccessfully. Acting is mediocre by everyone and in fact John Abraham can be seen making weird faces in the whole movie but stabilizes during few scenes towards the end. The only one who understood what film demands off her was Prachi Desai (Gauri) but even she was also not at her equilibrium. Where the acting disappointed me, the could-be-better portrayed story and direction entertained me equally making this flick a good one to go for this weekend which also holds a repeat value.DON'T FALL FOR NEGATIVE REVIEWS PEOPLE WILL WRITE IN BULK FOR THIS MOVIE AND DON'T GO WITH THE RATING STARS YOU SEE AT THE TOP. SOME FILMS JUST CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH WITH EVERYONE AND YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM, BUT THAT DOES NOT PROVE ITS WORTH. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT A MOVIE IS GOOD IF THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR WHILE YOU GET ENTERTAINED ALL THE WHILE, THIS IS THE MOVIE TO RUSH FOR.MY RATING - 7/10 |NUDITY - NO| |SEX - NO| |VIOLENCE - NO| |LANGUAGE - UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED| |DRUGS - NO|*UNIVERSALLY VIEWABLE*" 
" Very sweet movie","I normally don't write reviews here & just write a few words on films in my lists, but I couldn't help myself. The rating of this film is... 4? Really? FOUR?Meaning that Student of the Year has a better rating, Race 2 has a better rating, even Heroine has a better rating! This doesn't make sense. AT ALL.I Me Aur Main is a very sweet movie, with sweet music, sweet performances, and a sweet story. It's kind of Wake Up Sid with a love triangle (well, sort of) and a more adult take (I wouldn't call IMAM a coming of age story). Some found Wake Up Sid boring though a lot of other people recognize it is a very good film. Some found IMAM boring too, yet I still have to understand why the rating is low. You see tons of people complaining of brainless masala in Bollywood. There you have a touching story, and even if it doesn't touch you personally, nobody would call that dumb or brainless, and it gets a 4. Go figure.John Abraham is very credible here, I think it's the first time I've seen him so natural and expressive (the scene where he's drunk, the following scene the morning after, the last dialogue he has with Chitrangda, etc.). The rest of the cast is nice too. The performances are never over the top. The dialogues and story don't dawdle. The story manages to present a different kind of love triangle. It's not mind blowing but isn't your stereotypical love story either. There are some very well integrated humorous scenes. The film completely fulfill its mission of entertaining while giving an uplifting feeling (and not trying to fry your brains as some other movies do). An honest, simple, and fresh film." 
" Average","This is a descent movie that worth watch but it is not something that you must watch.This movie has succeeded to establish an aspect of selfishness for which the title is apt. The only drawback of the movie is John's acting, it is like always very clumsy.And there is an awkward situation in the ending, everything is happening too fast. As if , all of a sudden the director noticed that there is not much time left; so he suddenly started to wrap things up. Which makes the ending abrupt and senseless because there was not much explanation why John and Chitrangda can't start again though John was committed to change himself. And Chitrangda loves him a lot, so that doesn't make any sense. Otherwise , the whole movie is pretty enjoyable :)Multishopbd.com" 
" A badly conceived film offering you simply nothing.","The experience of watching this latest offering from the glossy, eye catching and fashionable section (genre) of the Hindi cinema developed in the last decade, I just remembered a recent discussion with a friend about the content found in our present well designed film magazines in the market.There was time when all the famous film magazines both in English & Hindi used to have many interesting articles on film-making, its music, the struggle of known artists, their interesting journey and much more enlightening stuff along with the usual news and gossip sections. But nowadays what we majorly get to read or see in the new-age versions of these magazines include many inviting full page photo-shoots, glamorous blow-ups and detailed discussions on the Star's fashion statements and their mismatches caught in the parties attended recently. In fact there is a big section of readers who actually buy the magazines for these major features only and get their own personal tips from the same.Now I, ME AUR MAIN perfectly reminded me of these film magazines as I really found it just similar to them having very less in the name of content and much in the name of pretty faces, glamorous outfits and glossy outlook. Taking the inspiration for its title from the west, for me the film was one of those projects wherein a producer or director successfully manages to sign an interesting star ensemble first without having any basic script or idea in hand. And once all the artists are on board, he simply starts making a film on a single line story idea to en- cash all the young attractive faces brought together as soon as possible with a quick shooting schedule.Strengthening the above thought, the film directed by the debutant Kapil Sharma,vaguely walks around a bold story-idea based on a live-in relationship, pre-marital sex and an unplanned pregnancy resulting in further complexities in the relationships. Interestingly the same plot has already been used in films such as KYA KEHNA and SALAAM NAMASTE with more maturity, elegance and sincerity which in nowhere to be found in I, ME AUR MAIN. The screenplay doesn't impress you at all in its two hours of duration and the narration uselessly tries to throw in many unwanted subplots which fall flat completely like the angle of Raima Sen and introduction of a new singer in the market played by Sheena Shahabadi.The cinematographer keeps in mind the young look of the film throughout but the same cannot be said about its music which gives you nothing to enjoy as a soundtrack. Playing the lead couple, both John Abraham and Chitrangda try hard to put some life in their loosely written roles in vain. Prachi Desai does bring in some spark but that too fizzles out fast as the film progresses quite uninterestingly. However, only Mini Mathurand Zarina Wahab have something meaningful to say in their few scenes enacted naturally which lift the film slightly in its second half.In all just choosing an unconventional theme representing the current state of relationships in the society is not enough, as you do need to put a great amount of sensitivity and emotional connect in the film in order to reach your target audience. And since I, ME AUR MAIN is not able to make than much needed connect with its viewers, relying hugely on its gorgeous faces only, you can easily give it a miss and later watch it as it gets released on Home Video if you wish." 
" There's Something Wrong With This Movie!","John Abraham is lagging behind and I wonder what must be the reason. 'Cause IMM is a very bad entertainer with such a maddening story, that you will sleep faster than you would attending an Engineering lecture.Chitrangada Singh & Mini Mathur are the only people that deserve my two-stars. Rest of the cast are either childish (John), over-smart (Prachi) or useless (Raima, etc) or watsed. While the title may be in line with the childish John, but seriously... he acts dumb as heck in this movie. Anyway, on a quest to the right thing (by ignoring his spoon-fed past), he actually commits another crime and breaks a heart. Even though, the climax is the most assuring one, it still didn't seem right. With an array of self-proclaiming goofs, I hard an easy time doing minute stuffs off my schedule while watching this. But, I assure this review is genuine.Score is poor and each & every scene culminates to single melody, songs are average, direction is average while editing is okay. Plot is way too hackneyed and anyone can predict it, no matter how hard the audience "doesn't" try. This is so not a cinema.I feel robbed and I, hereby vow I will not go for another John or Prachi celluloid because both of them have everything but the acting skill. Had the climax not been so friendly and predictive, I'd have rated it 6.BOTTOM LINE: 90% not recommended! In fact, everything's wrong with this one!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: Mediocre | Sex & Nudity: No, Implied | Smoking: No | Alcohol: Mediocre | Violence or Gore: No | Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Drugs: No" 
" A Good One-Time Watch!","Kapil Sharma's 'I, Me aur Main' is A Good One-Time Watch! It has a decent story to tell along-with terrific performances & soulful music working on its advantage.'I, Me aur Main' Synopsis: As Ishaan, a music producer who takes advantage of the women in his life, feels a connection with Gauri, his new next-door neighbor, he begins to learn the importance of friendship - causing him to work to repair his relationships.'I, Me aur Main' is nicely paced & executed. Kapil Sharma handles this human-story with maturity & sensibility. The characters work & so does the narrative. Sure, the second-hour does dip, but it never bores or leaves the viewer restless. Sharma deserves credit for getting his job right. Cinematography is consistent. Editing is sharp. Music by Falak Shabir, Sachin-Jigar, Gourav Dasgupta & Raghav Sachar, is soulful. Art & Costume Design, are okay.Performance-Wise: John Abraham is likable. He plays the self-obsessed protagonist with energy. Chitrangada Singh suits the part & is impressive throughout. Prachi Desai is first-rate. Raima Sen does very well. Zarina Wahab is flawless, yet again. Sheena Shahabadi is nicely restrained. Mini Mathur is as usual. On the whole, 'I, Me aur Main' is worth a watch." 
" Tries to be different but ends up mismash","John Abraham has done several non successful experiments, like No Smoking in 2007, This year he started with the conventional Race 2, But I me Aur Main was an experiment. It is more of an urbane comedy and deals with relationships. It has John in a role of a manmade child who likes himself a lot, There are affairs, misunderstandings, name it you get it. The film is well treated initially, even the way the complications arise is well brought out, but in between the director does get into conventional zone but yet he must be praised for getting the film to an unpredictable finale. The problem is the film picks and falls in between especially in second half.Direction Kapil Sharma is good in parts and he must be praised for picking something different Music is okay, Na Jaane is a fun remix of the classic Naa Jaane from Chaalbaaz though it isn't as good, rest songs are okayJohn Abraham tries hard to get into the character, he plays it well but at times he does get repetitive. Chitranganda Singh does her part well, Prachi Desai is superb in her role, Zarina is superb as John's mother,Raima Sen, Sameer Soni and rest are okay"

" not up to the mark","First-time director Kapil Sharma's I Me Aur Main depicts everything that's wrong with Indian patriarchal society. It also represents, on some levels, everything that's wrong with most stories in Hindi films. The plot, though, leaves a lot to be desired. While the first half of the film establishes the premise effectively and at a brisk pace, the second half meanders. The story loses its sense of direction – surely not all women are naive in their dealings with a man-child – and rushes to the end because all stories must have a crowd-pleasing ending in the appropriated run-time. I Me Aur Main falters with its plot, does a mild disservice to the ladies and is unreasonably forgiving of its protagonist. If you can get past that, it's a film you wouldn't mind watching once." 
" A soft and nice flick. Must watch!!","The people these days do consider the opinion which spread from nowhere about the movies of this kind. But this one is really a nice piece one should not miss this movie.The movie is about a man who think he is the best and yes why should not he? He is handsome, have a nice job, girls love him. But this guy faces certain circumstances which finally make him identify the mistakes he was doing, which of course a best man wont do at all. He realizes and return back to his commitments and every thing happens good finally.One should not always think of fictions or a huge star caste movie as a hit before releasing itself, and do completely injustice to such a nice and soft movie.I rate it high because i really like it and would suggest movie fans to watch this and do not trust on this 4 rating, this movie really deserve much more.Happy watching I ME AUR MAIN."
