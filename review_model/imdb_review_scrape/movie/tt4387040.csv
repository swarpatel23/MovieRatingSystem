" Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant !!","Over the years Akshay Kumar's choice of selecting the films has certainly improved with significant examples being Holiday, Baby, Special Chabbis, Gabbar Is Back to name few. Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine – Raja Menon's Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitement.Based on a true story, Airlift speaks about the Ranjit Katyal (played by Akshay Kumar) who helps the Indian Government collaborate with Air India to help evacuate 1,70,000 Indians from Kuwait after Iraq raided the country.From the director of critical acclaimed films like Bas Yun Hi and Barah Aana, Raja Menon does a fantastic research about the feat that was even recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record and surprisingly people are unaware about it. Airlift will consume you right from the beginning especially when Akshay's family faces the issue of Iraqi raiding Kuwait. From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. The music of the film is doing well on the chartbuster. The soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of "Mera Bharat Mahaan" actor and fans will love him in new avatar. The fresh pairing of Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur works well. Nimrat Kaur's realistic subtlety would harness Akshay Kumar's machismo and give us that perfect thrillerOverall , Airlift is nail-biting, reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4.5/5" 
" Steals Hearts!","After Bajrangi Bhaijaan, this one is the next heart stealer! In an industry where good films are not as often coming, movies like these are hugely treasured. Airlift is a real story where humanity is celebrated, and a movie on humanity needs to strike the right chord to enter the audience's hearts. And this one very memorably goes! Akshay Kumar gives his heart and soul to the role and is a huge reason why the movie achieves its heights. The screenplay and direction are top notch, and the music is very hum worthy. And best thing, it felt like it ended early as audiences were wanting more. Seriously Indian cinema standards will take a rise more with this movie. Highly recommended watch!" 
" Great Movie. Nice start for 2016","Airlift is simply a great movie whether you talk about direction or acting,its simply mind blowing. Akshay kumar's gritty acting is simply mesmerizing.Unlike other movies , songs of this movie are soothing and full of melody. Its great that they didn't put a item song. The film is based on the real-life conflict and bloodshed that took place twenty five years back in Kuwait, and the way it is done—with a sense of urgency and immediacy, bringing alive a city over-run and under siege—sends out a crucial message to star-driven-yet-drivel- producing Bollywood.Other than that Nimrat kaur's was also very good. Overall, 'Airlift' is a good film,solidly plotted, well executed and well- acted. A must watch. Its a perfect movie for Republic Day Week !" 
" Airlift will surely touch all Indians by heart!","As this year has been started well with Wazir, the good work of Bollywood is on the road with increasing the speed and performance. Yes, I'm talking about Akshay Kumar starer Airlift, directed by Raja Krishna Menon, and which is based on true events! Film starts in Kuwait. Rajiv Katyal (Akki) has been reached on the top level in business with his ability. He refers himself as a Kuwait citizen. But when the government leaves their citizens when Iraq attacks on Kuwait under the order of Saddam Hussain, the people becomes needless. Rajiv now feels that he is an Indian, and so along with other 1,70,000 people who are actually Indians but lives in Kuwait, he starts the mission to run from Kuwait as soon as possible. His tries, his communication to India for the help, and the officer's help from India - These things you can find out in this movie. Some factors, like emotions of love for the family, for the nation, for the coworkers and their relatives, for the people who are only belongs to the same nation, have been described very well. Many moments where we can feel patriotism. Raja has directed a superb film. Akshay has given a stunning performance as usual. I was comparing Baby film with this, but both are different. But if you ask for just one movie, than I'll go with this one. Nimrat Kaur is my favorite since The Lunchbox and Dairy Milk commercials. She has delivered a fine supportive job. She shines as a wife of a rich businessman and a caring mother. Kumud Mishra fits absolutely in the character of a government officer. Poorab Kohli has a small role. Supportive cast are fine, too. De Di and Soch Na Sake are very small songs. Perfectly situated. Tu Bhula Jise is the song to remember. Background score suits to the film. Dialogues are good. Nimrat's 3/4 minuets long conversation with a unsatisfied man of the camp who always complains, is a must! Cinematography is good. Some scenes give are shaky, those could have been shoot better. Editing is fine. Indian flag has been waved by an airport staff of Jordan and Akki is watching that, while Tu Bhula Jise song is playing - the scene has been brought so many whistles and shouts. And than one more, in which Air India plane is taking off, while Akki is watching that and in background Vande Mataram is playing - a truly emotional scene! It will surely gives you goosebumps! Overall, a must watch movie for every Indians, to know the largest human evacuation. Salute to all the real heroes! Jai Hind!" 
" Every Indian must watch Airlift for once.2016 starts with bang. Akshay kumar nailed the role....","Airlift is the best film of Akshay kumar till date. The story is all about a business man in Kuwait(Akshay) thinks that he is also a Kuwaiti. But when Iraq invades Kuwait he realizes that he is an Indian and helped all 170000 Indian. This movie give u goosebumps there is no boring scene in the movie. A perfect movie for Rebublic day. This movie is perfect for classy movie lovers who love this type of patriotic movies. All the star cast of the movie done a fantastic job. This time Akshay will surely get an award for Airlift. ...... Go with yours friends, family and watch AIRLIFT in theaters. U guys surely fell proud to be an Indian after watching this movie." 
" Great Movie, must watch.","What do you say about a movie like Airlift? THIS IS IT! (Remo Fernandes in Jhalak Dikhla Ja) One hasn't been to too many First Day Shows in the recent past. But this story was too compelling to pass up. One lugged a child and his friend and the friend's mother. All 4 to a First Day Show. And what a treat! The background music blends in so subtly you don't even notice it. The rest of the score is soothing, melodious and easy on the ears - not a mean feat for a quasi action film. BUT.. the best part is this - the characters are so beautifully etched. Each one of them - including the ensemble cast. Everyone has a place to fill, and everyone fills that place so well. Full marks to the Casting Director! And the actors, of course.I have become an Akshay Kumar fan in the recent years. From being Bollywood's favourite Khiladi in more ways than one, this person has matured as an actor. He brings that rare thing to the screen - persona. Nimrat Kaur does justice to her role. I would have liked a lot more layering in the expressions of this rather complex character, but that's just me. Joseph - who grows in stature from that first shot when Akshay Kumar is asking him how much moneys they have, to the end. Purab Kohli as Iqbal.. what can one say? He stands out, really, REALLY stands out, is all. You will have to see his performance to know what I mean. From the man who escorts the hero to a small gathering of friends in a supermarket, to the man who ensures an identity for a woman with an infant, and then looks the hero in the eye as he walks past, this man truly is an equal.But this was not one man's victory. Nor was it the story of one man. There were so many invisible hands who made this happen. They have been acknowledged in the end, but only in passing. They deserved so much more credit for standing by a man and supporting his battle.One Lakh Seventy Thousand WOWs for this movie. I can only imagine the scale of that number. A full residential complex with 1000 flats has only 5000 people on average. A full movie hall - maybe 150. A flight - 300? 448 flights. Those are numbers that will remain in our mind for a long, long time. Sad that it took so long for someone to tell such an inspirational story, but that time only makes it more special, as we are in a position to look back and appreciate how that one battle of 1990 changed the course of world history, and continues to do so - 25 years later."

" Historic Airlift..... One of India's best movie ever..... Akshay Kumar is just awesome He's the Best","What a beautiful gift to the Indian Cinema by Akshay Kumar, Raja Menon & the whole team of Airlift. The story of biggest human evacuation told amazingly well. Its so good from the start to end that you can feel what condition those 1,70,000 Indians would have gone through. Clap, clap & clap in the end that's what me & the whole theater was doing.Akshay Kumar as Ranjit Katiyal was just awesome he has taken his acting to another level with this one. Salute to him for doing amazing & inspirational movies like OMG, Holiday, Baby, Gabbar & now Airlift. Nimrat Kaur as his wife was just too good, her scene with Prakash Belawadi is awesome & clap worthy. Purab Kohli, Kumud Mishra & especially Prakash Belawadi were too good.Direction by Raja Menon is fabulous he has done a great work in researching this true story.Feeling so proud to be an Indian & realized what great thing my country India has done for all of us. Salute to all those unsung heroes of this biggest human evacuation ever.And Thank You to the whole team of Airlift for this historic movie. One of India's best ever." 
" A classic that India will always be proud of","Its rare, in its extremity, for Bollywood to make a masterpiece. But Akshay kumar has now the habit to steal the audiences, Last year it was with BABY and now its AIRLIFT.I was waiting for this movie since October and this is up to the mark,I had never review a movie but this made me to review.As it was mentioned by Akki that every family should take their children for airlift, and I will also recommend this to you. Their is a scene which will make you shout "VANDE MATRAM" and IF YOU ARE A Indian ,YOU MUST SEEE THIS EPIC. Definitely ,you will feel proud after watching this." 
" A must Watch Movie For every Indian and its doesn't matter u r Hindu or Muslim but if u are a real Indian and go and watch awesome movie","Guys a must watch movie for all peoples we are always watching Hollywood movie and think they are awesome and if u want a Indian heroism story so go and watch airlift best performance by akshay and nimrat and other star cast "Some stories *should* be told. #Airlift sheds light on the evacuation of Indians in Kuwait after the invasion by Iraq. Narrated BRILLIANTLY. #Airlift is taut, engrossing, leaves a hammer-strong impact. Raja Krishna Menon is a director to watch out for. Deserves brownie points. #Airlift is a must must watch. One of the finest films to come out of the Hindi film industry. Just do not miss this one" 
" Airlift - Stays true to its name!!!","It is one of those movies which will test your sensibilities and in the end will only make you stand up and clap.Just like an aircraft takes time to lift ,same is the case with Airlift.It takes time to build up in the first half but in the second it just flies and knocks you left right and center.Credit goes to Akshay Kumar who invested in the script.He brought the real patriotic Indian on screen.His performance was a total standout.It is a must watch for all those cynical and worthless Indians who do nothing but portray the essence of the nation in a bad light.Feeling really proud after watching this.Such movies really need to be encouraged!!!Vande Matram" 
" Milestones are rarely produced.","Milestones as airlift are rarely produced. Choice of star cast was amazing. 'GEORGE' is too good. Inaamhulaq is very impressive. Story is beautifully narrated without losing the grip . Everyone has given 100% either Nimrat or Purab. Performance by Akshay is at its seventh. A glimpse of every side of him is visible. Most importantly, even the Indian flag can make feel safe (truly patriotic and heart throbbing), after all "its our nature to call mother when hurt " . Overall, its a must watch. " I can't give you a reason to watch this movie, but grant yourself a one; so as to know who we Indians are and what we have done"."

" one of the best thriller made in India ever!!","Raja menon proved that one can make a superb thriller from an real life incident.Direction and acting is superb.Akshay proved again that he is one of the most versatile star today.Overall this movie is a treat for all Indian .Every one should watch it irrespective of whose fan you are.Release time is great(near republic day).Movie will keep you on the edge of seat all the time.Believe me this one is better than baby(akshay 2015 thriller movie) with more detailed and entertaining story line.It will face good competition from kkhh3 but as we all know content is king so the competition will be initial..in longer run airlift will be a sure shot winner." 
" Best Bollywood Movie Ever","Awesome Movie, quite a Realistic Depiction of of Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait, great Direction by Raj K menon, Akshay Kumar has played his part in q realistic way, His Best performance so has Nimrat Kaur and the entire crew as well.a great movie of decade and movie of patriotism. this movie will be guideline to current generation with balanced emotions action and romance. really great movie in recent times. if u miss this then u r looser. P.S. I am not Akshay fanAirlift is worth some hundred bucks. A story that will make you feel, that India cares for its Indian's. Exhilarating performance by AkshayKumar. Trust me guys this movie will surely lift you up." 
" The Ratings though !!!","One thing I've found prevalent among Indian cinemas are the ratings.Some of them are absurd to a point where you doubt the authenticity of IMDb as a source for checking the quality of any movie.This movie is one of the good ones but still it does not deserve its rating at all.There is no way it comes close to it.For example consider the latest release like Deadpool or Batman vs Superman.Both are equally excellent in terms of story,cinematography and both possess a line of star studded casts.Yet both of them do not have a rating they deserve because of the fair and right ratings from experts and viewers not from a particular or single place but from all over the world.Looking at this rating,I seriously doubt the entire Indian cinema ratings and would rather skip than waste my time and energy to go through any of the high rated movies and would skip the ones that do not even reach 5.This is my personal opinion but all I'm saying is the fans are not doing anyone any favors by giving outrageous ratings."
