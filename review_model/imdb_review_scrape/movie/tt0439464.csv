" Heart touching songs with a good climax !!","It's a musical, based on the life and story of Janab Ataullah Khan, the poet, the singer. In the movie, Sundar Sehgal (Krishan Kumar) was an all rounder , who wanted to become a great cricketer like his father. As he was moving ahead towards his goal, then a girl, Sheetal (Shilpa Shirodkar) comes in his life. Her entry & the professional rivalry with a fellow mate, Gautam. Sagar turns everything upside down. He lost his mother, killed his own lover, Sheetal for which he was imprisoned. Mamta (Shilpa Shirodkar, double role ) who resembles Sheetal was the daughter of Jailer (Kiran Kumar) . She tries and succeeds in finding the real truth behind the conspiracy with the help of Onkar ( Asrani ). In the concluding part of the movie, we come to know that Sagar had conspired everything. He was the person behind Sheetal's denial of marriage proposal and killing her. Knowing the truth, Sundar's spirit leaves his body. I give 7 out of 10 for this flick. The movie had some unnecessary characters in it but Kishan k and his acting was outstanding. And again - Sonu, Udit Narayan have given few awesome songs which one will listen again and again in their life. The double role from the actress was outstanding. Shakti Kapoor again at his best performances. I would recommend any lovers watch this movie once in their life !"
