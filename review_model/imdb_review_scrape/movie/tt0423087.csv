" Average!","When I first heard about this movie being made and Sunny Deol being in it, I was really excited, as it was said to be a rivalry of 2 army schools, and I thought (Sunny's role would be perfect). However, over a year later (some months) after the film released, I was really disappointed. The rivalry was over 2 high schools, and Sunny's role was very small, and he was mum most of the time. I really felt bad that Sunny was wasted in this movie, although his get-up as the motorcycle dude was cool. The movie overall was NOT that great, just average. He can actually dance (see the song by Abhijeet). Sunny is a true icon of 'believing in oneself,' but he should have gotten substantial footage. Along with this, if the story was different, this could have been much better and more exciting." 
" Rok sako to rok lo is a great film!","After a long time I have seen a film that scores well on all fronts. This film leaves a happy taste behind and creates a great feel good mania.Acting of all the new comers is commendable and direction very good.Music and lyrics are really nice and so is the story.Best thing about the film is the climax that makes sure you are standing on one feet for entire 15-20 minutes. The confrontation scenes between the two school have a lot of energy and appeal. My nephew saw the film thrice and with his entire gang of friends who are as crazy.I think Rok Sako to rok lo is one of my all time favorites!" 
" Colors of the young!!","The film Rok Sako To Rok Lo is out rightly a winner with its target audience. Rok Sako.., though less likely to tickle the mature sanity of the seniors, is capable of effectively titillating the juvenile wits of the young. But if you've decided and hit your target audience, it's a prudent contraption.The packaging and look & feel of the film is rich & colorful. The faces look fresh. The biggest trump card of the film is its music. All songs are urbanely melodious and better than each other. They also fit into the situations quite well. Cinematography and lighting is top of the line.The story of the film is also encapsulating. Where few casual viewers relate the story to Jo Jita I think it shall be unfair to draw this parallel. A film cannot be baptized a copy only because a similar event happened in another film it's very convenient to say so In that case all love stories are copies of each other, all films that use motorbikes or cars as heroic props are.. all war films are.. all period films are and so on.Rok Sako To Rok Lo stands out by sheer quality of its production. The scenes depicting immature love are directed with dense maturity. Debutante director Arindam Chaudhuri does not make the audience feel he's a first timer. He has made the film with refined finesse. For someone directing his first film, that too with first timers in the lead role and a heavyweight (Sunny Deol) to manage in a special role, it's a directorial triumph.Rok Sako.. leaves behind a positive taste and cuts like a warm knife in butter.. throughout its duration. It's a good family entertainer especially if you have school going kids in your family. I hope more such films are made in India that not only entertain but also leave behind a strong message and cuts away from the usual and boring. All brawny points to Rok Sako.." 
" A nostalgic trip down the memory lane","Rok Sakois one of the most heart-warming films ever made in Indian film history. It sensitizes the youthful spirit inside every one of us. Rok Sako is all about the evergreen spirit of sweet romantic simplicity, which we are so deprived of in the contemporary world of complexity and competition. The film is like a nostalgic trip down the memory lane, the teenage days, when we were caught in the conflict of dreams and expectations the growing up years, of winning and losing, of mischief and punishments, of friendships and innocence, the crushes and heart breaks Dev, the protagonist of the film, is like any other eccentric teenager from the humble Bharti school, indulges in his own world of dreams with his friends Ganguly, Bhajji, Venky and naive Manjari. These five friends are tied together in an eternal bond of friendship. As they bask in the freshness of youth and the spirit of innocent adventure. Together they find their way through a maze of trials and tribulations. They however live in a carefree illusory world where lofty ambitions and preparations for a secure tomorrow have little meaning. Though driven by an invincible life spirit  rok sako to rok lo, Dev and his friends are no match against Ranveer, the undisputed champion from the snobby Valley High School. Ranveer lives large. He has all the luxuries most young ones his age aspire for. He also has Sanjana, the gorgeous buzz of the Valley school. Intimidated by the high-handed winning streak of Ranveer, Dev and his friends falter and fail. Enters Kabir into their life. Kabir, whom they refer to as Phantom, is a mysterious and seemingly unapproachable Harley Davidson biker who inspires awe in all. In an unexpected turn of events, Phantom rides into Suhana's life and eventually make friends with her gang. A loner himself, Kabir is drawn towards them by the magic of their innocent and unconditional friendship. With his unconventional wisdom, Kabir provokes Dev and his friends to stand up and face the challenges thrown against them. Dev's faith in friendship and his friends is reinforced. He discovers his first love, his true love. The film climaxes into a grand operatic crescendo as Dev, Suhana and friends for the first time ever live their life spirit  rok sako to rok lo, in its truest form. Rok Sako To Rok Lo is a rich canvas of colors, emotions and true to life characters, with a very earthy feel. It is well blended with brilliant and youthful melodies making it a wholesome experience." 
" Fun-filled package of school pranks","For a débutant director, Prof. Arindam Chaudhuri does a good job with 'Rok Sako To Rok Lo'. The story of a group of teenagers from two rival schools - Bharti School and Valley High - is narrated by Namrata Shirodkar, who owns a café -- a common haunt for students from both institutions. While the group from Bharti School is led by Dev (Yash Pandit), the rival gang is headed by Ranveer (Carran Kapoor).Valley High students turn up their noses at the Bharti School youngsters, always taunting them because of their lower social status as well as their inability to beat the Valley-ites at any sports event.Enter teen siren Sanjana, who studies with Ranveer. Dev and gang tease the temptress and Sanjana, swearing revenge, ensnares Dev and pretends to be in love with him. Dev finds out only too late that he has been duped.Kabir, watching this byplay, befriends the group led by Dev, and instills a sense of confidence in them, urging them on to finally take a stand and beat their adversaries. Unfortunately, their enthusiasm leads to both gangs engaging in a dangerous car race on public roads. During the race, Kabir is killed in a ghastly accident, once again plunging the Bharti School students into depression. To make matters worse, they are challenged to a marathon race by Valley School...The lead pair, Yash Pandit and Manjari Fadnis, both selected through a talent hunt done by the producers, impress in their very first film with their high levels of confidence. Sunny Deol, who plays the role of Kabir  the mysterious man with a 'history'  pops up time and again to save the youngsters from sticky situations, and receives all the applause. While audiences in the North might clap for their favourite hero literally flinging the goons left, right and centre, the action could have been toned down a bit for the Mumbai viewers. Jatin-Lalit's music remains above reproach, especially the peppy and inspiring title track.All in all, a fun-filled package of school pranks and youthful masti (with liberal doses of good advice) that will appeal to the younger generation." 
" Cheap Copy of Jo Jita Wohi Sikandar - Could give it 0 if there was an option","So bad is this movie that it can be called CRAP. You can see many people giving good reviews are the students of IIPM. I have been observing this movie for reviews for a long time the rating was 2.1 few months back suddenly the ratings have increased to 5.1 what a joke! You can check the profiles of these students (reviewers). They have reviewed only his movies like "The last Lear" and all have given 10 stars! Prof Arindhim must surely made the students of IIPM to put the reviews.It is so poorly that spending my energy to type this is waste. It has extremely poor direction, cheap publicity...Please avoid this film. Sunny Deol acted like a log. The two new actors were awful at the best. Songs are so bad, I don't know on what basis Mr Arindhim was claiming that this movie is a super Hit." 
" must watch for every wanna be film maker!","This is the first comment i am writing on IMDb, despite being a regular here. The movie was so bad that it forced me to write this comment. You really need to see the movie to believe that it could be have made at all. Apparently, if you have a lot of money, and enough ego, a drivel like this can be put across.This is THE movie to watch at a film school. All film makers in the making should watch this film to avoid pitfalls and obvious errors. Each scene is a class in itself. HOW NOT TO WRITE A MOVIE. Everything that could go wrong is incorporated in it. Almost as if it was designed to be bad. From the script to the incomplete characters, to the use of bad casting, to the hyperbole marketing. This movie shows what happens when one lacks aesthetic sensibilities in a domain. The only reason i wrote this is to warn other wannabe film makers with lots of money in the pocket, but not enough time spent watching and studying the craft.... A clear case of "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing." the hack who made this travesty of a film (runing out of negative qualifiers), gives dilettantes a bad name. An even more casual dabbler of film making could have made a better thing (notice how i refrain from calling it a movie/ film)A management "guru" can at best be good at transferring knowledge of academic nature. Trying to translate that academic knowledge into a living, breathing film is a totally different ball game. Look what happened when they put the worlds economy in the hands of MBAs. Come to think of it, the reason i am so upset, is the gall with which the movie was promoted, and proclaimed a hit even before it was released. Did someone forget the cardinal marketing sin? The fastest way to kill a product is to advertise a bad product heavily.N.B. do watch the film, it will surprise you no end. Dekh sako to Dekh lo. Also, there are some comments in this section claiming it to be good enough to get a 10. I am quite sure they passed out of IIPM with good grades!" 
" Fresh Faces makes the movie better.....","The movie shows the rivalry between the students of two different school students as both belongs to different society and different backgrounds.I have seen a lot of movies but for me this movie is amazing and advice everyone to watch the movie at least once.My personal experience about the movie is the best movie i have seen based on youths especially school going students and i really appreciate the work done by debut director Arindam Chaudhuri and all the debut actors,all were very nice in the movie.If i compare this movie to Jo Jeeta Wohi Sinkandar then i like this movie more as the movie shows lot of new comers fresh faces which makes the movie better than that." 
" Great work done by all !!!!!","RSTRL is a very nice movie that had everything in it for the audience, particularly the younger generation. Arindam Chaudhuri,writer and director of the film has done a tremendous job as the director and finished the film brilliantly more so because it had competitors.The film is compared to Jo jita wohi sikander,but both are completely different.The movie did not just dealt with the fights and rivalry.It had more than this.There are the sweet and cute love stories developing between the characters.It had adventure and the journey of the youngsters.I really appreciate the work done by all the newcomers in the movie,director as well as the cast." 
" A superb entertainment by Arindam Chauhduri","I am fond of watching movies and hardly miss any movie and have good knowledge about movies.I have seen lot of movies and for me this is the best movie for me.The movie contain all the elements which a movie needs to be successful and best part is its storyline.I really like the movies based on school and college going students and this movie not only shows the life of teenagers but inspires us and encourage us to fight against our rivals.I personally like the character of sunny deol,he was very motivating in the movie and his dialogs were very good.The way he performs his character was brilliant.This was the debut movie of Arindam Chaudhuri and he was excellent in his work.The movie not only the debut directional movie for him but also written the dialogs in the movie and was very good.The lead pair also makes debut through this movie and both were perfect choice for the roles.Both were too good in their characters." 
" Same as Jo Jeeta... Highly Avoidable movie... Rating:1/10","Note: The readers who have seen 'Jo Jeeta wohi sikandar' (1992) (JJWS) may skip the 'storyline' and directly proceed to the 'comment'.The movie beings in scenic place with two rival schools Bharti and Valley High. Bharti School is a school for the modest lot (but who apparently live in palatial houses by Mumbai's standards). A group of friends led by the protagonist of the story Dev (Yash Pandit, a newcomer) and his dearest friends Suhana (Manjari Fadnis, another newcomer) Ganguli, Bhajji, Venki and Rati regularly freak together. Valley High on the other hand is the place for the spoilt brats Ranveer, Sanjana, Tango and Ziggy. A nearby coffee shop owned by Namrata Shirodkar is where the groups spend time regularly.Both the schools have a predictable amount of rivalry in the Annual marathon (similar to the cycle race rivalry in JJWS). Valley is shown to be always interested in belittling the modest Bharti lot. Sanjana tries to play 'girl friend' with Dev and predictably, this causes envy to Suhana. But when Dev learns about Sanjana's motives, he is disappointed.Enter Phantom (Sunny Deol) on a Harley Davidson. He seems to be the man Friday for Bharti's friends. He motivates Dev to go faster-higher-stronger towards winning the next year's marathon. Phantom gets a new Lexus SUV and takes his young friends out for a drive, with Dev driving it. A freak accident of the SUV kills Phantom. Dev is left grief-stricken. With a mixed feeling of guilt for Phantom's death and with a mind motivated by Phantom's words, Dev takes part in the marathon. The rest is predictable anyway.Comment:If you have read the above summary of the story, I'm sure that you would have been disappointed. Watching the movie would disappoint you further. The story absolutely lacks originality and is almost the same as JJWS. Arindam Choudhury's directorial skills are absolutely pathetic.Performances are average, not due to the actors themselves, but due to the poor screenplay. Sunny Deol has no other role except showing off his Harley. Poor Namrata Shirodkar almost doesn't have a single dialogue in the movie. The lead actor Yash needs to shape up (viewers compare his role with the legend Amir Khan in JJWS). Manjari seems promising. The music is poor and there is hardly a song that you would feel like humming. The dance moves were hopeless." 
" A classic film for teenagers","Arindam Chaudhari's directorial debut Rok Sako To Rok Lo is a campus classic with a story based on the rivalry between two groups of students from different social and economic backgrounds.The film deals with the dispute between two neighbouring high schools -Bharti School and Valley High School.Both schools are completely contrast in nature.The former very peaceful and the latter equally violent.There are many new faces in the film.Yash Pandit and Manjari Fadnis are among the newcomers.Dev (Yash Pandit), Suhana (Manjari Fadnis), and their friends belong to Bharti School, and are often disturbed by their rivals who come from Valley High. Sunny Deol is simply superb as Kabir 'phantom'.Kabir motivates the young guns before moving on with his life.An inspired Dev readies for the ultimate test that will prove his capabilities and dismantle the egos of high flying Ranveer and his gang.The movie is filled with many interesting turns and twists.It surely leaves some mark and has a sensible ending" 
" Must be seen at least once.","Rok sako to rok lo is story revolving around the rivalry between students of two different schools.It is about how much they really disliked each other and how eager they wanted to beat the other in any competition.Sounds quite familiar and common story.But all doesn't end here.This movie is more than just the story.Debutante director and many new faces makes the film really fresh and new.Not for once it looked like the director of the film is working as a debutante. It stars Sunny Deol,Yash Pandit and Manjari Fandis.Yash and Manjari were among the others making debut with the film. We all love such stories and the best and this movie does satisfy to a huge extent.Its really good and an entertaining movie.Must be seen once to know more about the interesting story and the ending." 
" a decent debut","Breaking new grounds and braving new frontiers. Hats off to Prof. Chaudhuri!!! What a film with chills and frills. Though the storyline is not that new, yet the treatment has been done in an admirable comportment. I remember my granny singing lullaby and narrating fairy tales to me when I was three. I still remember that at the end of each story on each night, there was a savior who always rose from the ashes like phoenix.When I watched Rok Sako to Rok Lo, I saw that knight in shining armor in Sunny Deol as "Phantom". The new frontiers as I just mentioned though are not as polished as the superstars yet seem to be promising. If reviewed from the Debutant Director's point of view with a lot of debutant actors in lead, the film and the film maker seem to be super promising." 
" Lame Barjatya "freshness" and a random Sunny Deol","Before, I say anything, let's all take a moment to laugh at Sunny Deol. Ha ha ha! He's so random in this movie. For the first half he comes in at any random scene, drives his "ooo aaa" (not really) motorcycle in his punk/don't-mess-with-me (not really) look with his scraggly long hair and ill-fitting leather jacket. No wonder all the "high school" students in the movie look up to him as their idol. (Actually, we all wonder.) It's so funny, in one his scenes, it's shows him driving in slow motion for a couple of seconds. It's not actually slow motion! He's just driving really slow, and he looks really dumb! Enough of Sunny Deol's "inspirational" role and back to the main story or lack thereof. I don't know what's going on with this movie but it seems like they're just trying to recreate the lame fresh/innocent atmosphere in the recent Barjatya films. The only thing worse than being lame is trying to be lame, making you even more lame. Songs were terrible except for the title track, which was good. The main actor and actress gave good debuts. If you have nothing better to do (which I'm sure is not true), watch this movie just to laugh at Sunny Deol." 
" Films about losers winning are forever liked by audiences","Films about losers winning are forever liked by audiences. The more up to date examples being Lagaan and Iqbal, also set against sports backdrops. Go back a bit and there's the Rocky-inspired Boxer.That's the beauty of the worm-turning formula-it gets the audience rooting for the guy who fights seemingly insurmountable odds and wins. If the losers are rich snobs, so much the better! The film is a bitter-sweet coming of age tale, as well as the story of love, friendship and family triumphing against adversity.Arindam has done a beautiful job by grooming this subject and creating a milestone like Rok Sako to Rok lo. Or perhaps he has embedded his management concepts into the film since he is a great speaker on motivation (Have heard during a seminar in Delhi).All the characters in the movie have balanced the act, whether it's Manjari who is a simple-dimple next door girl or whether its Aparna "snobbish" Kumar. Bhajji scores well with his laughter riots. There is a slight possibility of grey haired not liking the flick, but for the youth, it's a change of life. All in all, it's a movie that stands for its sheer opulence. Bravo Arindam!!!"
