" Nice love story","I watched this movie on 12 oct 2013 and found it really pleasing. Nice story and pain is beautifully portrayed by actors.Sometimes I felt that the story is bookish, but as I have felt such things... like "Jb hum mile the tb bhi brsaat ho rhi thi aur aaj bhi brsaat ho rhi hai"... but the thing is that,, I have also felt such situations which looks like bookish but they happen in real when you love someone truly... So I don't consider that a bookish thing.... I liked the concept and this movie left an open question.......1) If Kajal truly loved Aarav, she won him..... 2) Aarav loved Kajal that's why he went again to his wife.....3) Aarav loved Anna.... Also Anna loved him by true heart.. then why fate decided to play with Anna... We truly love but sometimes we don't get the one we love... its not that Anna's love was lesser than Kajal.. both were very good and loved aarav from bottom of heart.. but fate decided to give Aarav to Kajal... and left Anna in pain.... Anna said in the end....... "Aarav loves me a lot.. its just he loves Kajal a little more".I hold my wife with tears in eyes....." 
" A Beautiful Romantic film with Great Story, and Nice Songs.","Assalam-O-Alaikum,Just watched Bobby Deol's New movie 'BARSAAT', it touched my heart, just not because of Bobby, but the story, true feelings for love, sacrifice, songs, screen-play, direction.'BARSAAT' is a light romantic film with drama, emotions, and nice songs.It feels good to see Bobby in a light romantic film, he is just brilliant with his performances. Bobby did romantic films in the past like; ...AUR PYAAR HO GAYA, KAREEB, and DILLAGI. Those movies were really good, and I enjoyed a lot watching those, Bobby was Superb in those. I don't know why those movies were not appreciated? it is just because critics cannot digest Bobby in romantic films. Well, who the hell cares about what the critics state? All I want to say is that I have never seen Bobby b/f in any film like this. I would say that Akshay Kumar could not deliver the performances in 'BARSAAT' which Bobby has. Bobby was meant to do 'BARSAAT'.The story, screen-play of the movie is interesting. The Director has shown the love of 2 women for a man. One is born, and grown-up in Foreign, while the other one is born, and grown-up in India. The culture, traditions, and customs are different, but, the feelings for love are same. You will have to see the movie to find out who gets Bobby? either Bipasha, or Priyanka, obviously one has to sacrifice.Songs are great, nice, melodious, sweet-sounding, and already caught the attention of audience from the very first day.I have seen Suneel Darshan's previous films, but his direction in this film is awesome. It won't be wrong to state that this is Suneel Darshan's best direction to date.Bobby is just simply brilliant with his acting, vocals, dressing, and looks. It seems that Bobby was meant to do 'BARSAAT'. He performs like a seasoned performer and delivers a knockout performance. In fact, it won't be wrong to state that this is amongst Bobby's best performance to date after 'BARDAASHT'.Priyanka is surprise package in the film, she impresses with her performances. This film breaks her modern image. She looks pretty, nice, and beautiful in Salwaar Kameez.Bipasha is also good. She performs well.On the whole, 'BARSAAT' is a family entertainer. It is a very beautiful made film with great feelings for love. It is something to watch. It has all; Drama, Comedy, Emotions, Nice Songs, Romance, and Outstanding performances by Actors. Go, and Watch, u will enjoy it, don't believe what the critics state, remember SEEING IS BELIEVING, You won't be disappointed.Allah Haafiz. Zeeshan Kazi - A BOBBY DEOL DIE HARD FAN." 
" Typical Indian film","They're playing a game. Let's call it a mime game. At a filmy picnic the disgruntled husband Bobby Deol, who wants to divorce his stunningly desirable wife Priyanka Chopra (only god and the script writer know why anyone would want to do something so foolhardy), is asked: "What's the Hindi word for divorce?" Talaq, comes the grumpy answer."Nope," replies the wife with coolness. "Talaq is an Urdu word. We don't have a Hindi word for divorce because the concept is alien to our culture." You may not agree with Kajal, aka Priyanka Chopra, and the pungent wisdom that's thrust on her by dialogue writers K.K. Singh and Rumi Jaffrey.But you sure as hell can't take your eyes off this lady as she performs a role that requires her to be coy and captivating, strong and sobbing, demure and dynamic... all at once.Within a year Priyanka has grown into a formidable screen queen. In "Barsaat" she reveals that rare ability, which Sridevi possessed to rise above the screen material and lack of support from co-stars to prove herself a complete scene stealer, since she lifts many of the most mundane moments in this old fashioned, and at times pale melodrama.It's easy and trendy to be ultra-cynical about a film like "Barsaat" where the values propagated and the images generated seem to have emanated from a frozen time of movie montages that date back to the oldest tradition of the kitschy formula.And yet to deny the archaic magnetism of "Barsaat" is to deny the most renewable traditions of Hindi cinema.Amidst a torrent of indifferent Nadeem-Shravan songs that pin down the plot, "Barsaat" is a film that manages to squeeze in an important message for deserted wives. Don't pine for the swine. Make hay while the sun shines.No Shabana Azmi in "Arth"... And yet Priyanka Chopra is no walkover either.When her wimpish husband (Bobby Deol, suitably cast) forces the wife to sign the divorce papers she immediately builds a new life for herself, and smilingly returns the cheque that hubby dear wants to give his dumped wife as a conscience pacifier.Deol's passage to spousal indifference could have been charted more convincingly. When he moves to the US (city unnamed) to pursue his dreams, sell car designs to BMW and gets engaged to the rich heiress Anna (Bipasha Basu, looking slim and svelte). is he just being a cardboard cad? Or does Deol symbolise the very real and contemporary dilemma of the average small-townsman who wants to get 'there'? Director Suneel Darshan's vision impales the three main characters in a familiar and played-out triangle. The focus of interest isn't what's being said, but what the spoken words and the saturated background score (Salim-Suleiman) would like us to hear beyond the shrill clarion call of a shehnai (pipe instrument) that the filmmaker plays as a sort of an old-world wedding bard.There're constant if unconscious homages to the cinema greats. The shaadi song where Kajal dresses up her rival in love as a bride and sings and dances at her own husband's wedding (see how Priyanka takes on the competition) conveys the enchantment of Raj Kapoor's "Ram Teri Ganga Maili".And when Bobby Deol commands his utterly devoted wife to sign on the divorce paper he reminds you of Rakesh Roshan ruthlessly demanding separation from Smita Patil in J. Om Prakash's "Aakhir Kyon".From Raj Kapoor to J. Om Prakash, Suneel Darshan's vision encompasses the best of mainstream Hindi cinema. But that forward fillip that separates a fulfilling homage from a slapdash recreation is largely absent.The fringe characters (for example Bipasha's giggly friend and Bobby's turbaned sidekick) are stereotypes that belong to an outdated time zone. But you've to hand it to Darshan. He knows the filmy formula in and out. What use he makes of it is another matter." 
" For Bobby/Priyanka/Bipasha/Nadim Shravan fans only.",". This is my first Darshan movie -- and last -- unless it stars Bobby (Dosti is next).. Don't think I've seen a recent movie so indifferently directed, scripted, and lensed. Photography in particular is off-putting. Flat-lighting, out-of-focus, grainy film-stock, etc... movie looks like it was shot in 1978.. The mise-en-scene is haphazard, the actors don't look as if they got much in the way of direction from Darshan.. Script is strictly by-the-number. Lacks internal logic. The situations are contrived (too many coincidences, etc...) and the characters' motivations are questionable (and predictable). The dialogue must be the worst part -- very clich√©d, too much irrelevant banter, attempts at comic relief fall flat.. Random song placement -- they follow each other without much contextual logic -- and the picturization of songs doesn't take full-advantage of potential opportunities. That said, the music is enjoyable and Bipasha and Priyanka make for nice eye-candy. The Nakhre, Saajan Saajan, and Barsaat Ke Din Aaye songs are best.. The saving graces of the movie are the actors, who try their best to imbue their sketchy characters with any semblance of life. Bobby looks like a million bucks. He is his usual earnest self and does his damned best to make his Arav ring true, but the character does come off as unlikeable in the end due to the awkward changes of heart the script dictates. The "ravishing" (trailer quote) Bipasha looks ravishing indeed -- the best I've seen her look thus far -- and that's saying a lot! This is strictly a look-pretty kind of roles as she doesn't have much to do acting-wise. Unlike most, I like the "sensuous" Priyanka in her role. I did not find her "amateurish" as some have said. She had the most difficult role of the lot as it required her to go through a gamut of emotions, something she achieved quite well in my opinion. I find her truly lovely, very feminine, very soft-spoken, a good contrast to Bipasha's more "modern" city girl.On the whole, the film is too breezy (read: desultory) to leave much of a mark and is instantly forgotten once one is out of the theater." 
" Close to the heart and Sweet","Im a huge movie buff--I've basically seen them all and Barsaat is a movie I recommend everyone see, despite its few flaws. It is a very distinct remake of Hollywoods "Sweet Home Alabama" with Reese Witherspoon and Patrick Dempsey, but in all honesty I enjoyed Barsaat more.There is very realistic chemistry between Bobby Deol and Priyanka Chopra, especially towards the end. While the storyline, with a man and two completely different women, is nothing new to Bollywood films, it was executed in an entire unique style. Bipasha Basu acts as the Americanized love interest of Bobby Deol and I think she comes off well as a light and bubbly character. Priyanka Chopra's role is the exact opposite as she plays the completely Indianized childhood love of Bobby Deol, however her acting is quite commendable, especially in those deep and touching scenes where she intelligently counters Bobby Deol in battles of the wits. Bobby Deol too surprises in this light, romantic flick as his character is lovable yet strong. It is easy to recognize his deep feelings towards both girls.The songs in the movie are especially good. "Nakhre" is an excellent upbeat tune, it will get anyone dancing. "Mushkil" and "Barsaat Ke Din Aaye" are my favorite songs, as they are both extremely sweet and the vocals are amazing.Overall I recommend this film to anyone who likes watching light, feel good films. Families can even watch it together and enjoy. It makes everyone want to fall in love and goes in a different direction than most movies with similar story lines. Therefore I say FORGET WHAT THE CRITICS SAY and WATCH IT! Trust me, you wont regret it :)" 
" The case of yet another weak willed hero","Within the framework of the cliched love triangle Barsaat tries to stand out by etching out distinct emotional trajectories for the two heroines. All else is routine kitsch. Bobby is portrayed as the weak-willed hero who wants to have his cake and eat it too. Bipasha pulls wool over his eyes when she is attracted to him, and uses her pull to get him a top position at her grand dad's BMW factory. Bobby's lack of self respect rather than his greed is what stands out as he agrees to walk down the aisle with her! Bipasha stays true to her character and 'nobly' renounces him on discovering his subliminal indecision to divorce Priyanka!Priyanka has the more author backed role of the three despite making an entry almost an hour into the movie. Unwilling to divorce Bobby, she gives it all she has, to retain him. Yet she grants him his divorce when he confesses he has no love for her. The last scene where Bobby blames her for not recognizing he loves her back despite what he told her is ridiculous and only solidifies his weak character! I thought there was a plot point that was either dropped or not utilized - Bipasha has lost both her parents and been brought up by her grand dad (Shakti Kapoor!); Priyanka has also lost both her parents and been brought up by her grand mom (Farida Jalal!) I half expected them to be long lost sisters and Shakti-Farida o be an estranged couple! But the director did not seem to think so!Bobby somnambulates through his routine Jeetendra-ish role and relies on his natural good looks to work the charm. Bips gets and on the nerves when she is tired of showing off her fab body ion itsy bitsy clothes to prove her 'westernized' role. Priyanka show the beginnings of her blossoming career as the quintessential hindi film heroine she would become during the next few years with Don, Fashion and Dostana. The supporting cast is wasted. The visuals are pleasing. Nadeem Shravan's music sounds familiar like they reused their 90s tunes." 
" Just the same sentimental crap always seen at Bollywood. It Sucks.","Plot Outline: Aarav (Bobby Deol) is a Car Designer looking for an opportunity in the US. He meets his destiny Anna (Bips), the sole heiress to BMW's Chief (Shakti Kapoor) who gives him the needed break. Eventually both fall in love and get engaged. He returns to India to erase his past marriage with Kajal (Priyanka Chopra) who knows nothing except loving Aarav. Rest is Bollywood drama of Aarav's choice between the two girls and his career.Comment: Oh Boy! What a movie! When did Americans start driving on the left side of the Road? Or didn't they find anybody better than the Moron Shakti Kapoor to play BMW Chief? The guys in Germany must be pulling their hair apart. Another startling revelation from Suneel Darshan is that there's no equivalent word for 'Divorce' in Hindi. During a game in the movie, Priyanka asks "What's the Hindi word for divorce?" Bobby Deol replies "Talaq'". Priyanka says "Nope, Talaq is an Urdu word. We don't have a Hindi word for divorce because the concept is alien to our culture." Bobby loses the bet (which is a kiss) it and then there's song and dance again. What Trash! The movie is called a 'sublime love story', while it is actually a confusion of an emotional drama. Bobby fits the bill to play the confused guy who during 10 years in a boarding school never saw home, and returns home for just 48 hours, gets married to Priyanka and then flies to USA. What more, Priyanka builds an export business worth crores surprising Aarav. Priyanka who's at her best should've steered away from this apology of a movie. Bipasha fits into the glam-girl/sob-girl role well. Shakti Kapoor, Ha-ha, lesser said the better. Music is passable barring Barsat Ke Din and Nakhre which too are plain.Rating: 1.5/5" 
" A love triangle totally avoidable.","A movie to avoid. Inspired by "Sweet Home Alabama" the story has very bad dialogues. Most of the dialogues are so miserably corny that instead of arousing compassion they are downright funny. First half of the movie is apparently based in the US ...but cars are driven on the left side?? An obvious miss and many other contradictions showing that the direction is pathetic. The songs are not so bad and Priyanka's acting is at par with what we have come to expect of her. (But why someone with her talent would opt do such a corny movie is beyond me). Bipasha carries her skimpy costumes well in the wet dance sequences that bollywood movies are getting known for. It has many break downs in consistency and also some parts which are hard to digest (Priyanka waiting for Bobby Deol to return from a boarding for 10 years and he does not visit home even once in that time!! He returns after becoming an engineer and has 48 hrs before he must depart for the US and manages to visit home, get married and pack and catch his flight)." 
" I blame him for everything!","Watch the film and you'll see what I'm talking about. Anyways, before I get into anything, let me begin with the problems with Barsaat.1. The first half of the film claimed to be filmed in America but clearly it was not. I am tired of Indian directors trying to pass off one country as another in Hindi films! It is annoying and frustrating! The White extras all had European accents, the cars had weird license plates and nothing within the context of the first half's scenes resembled anyplace I've seen in America so far, and everybody I know who has seen the film agrees.2. The White extras in Hindi films are always so monotonous. It's like they just show up to read their lines, no acting required and it's especially bad in this film. For more Bad Gora acting, see films like Asambhav, Elaan, Aitraaz, Kisna etc. etc.3. The film starts out to slow and depends on the songs too much. Every song in it is great so I can't really blame them for running to a song scene whenever the film started to drag.4. Anna's (played by Bipasha Basu in a role that Aishwarya Rai turned down) parents in the film were killed in a motor accident, yet while taking a car out from a dealership for a test drive, she foolishly attempts to tie her hair into a scarf while maneuvering the steering wheel on a freeway at the same time. What a psycho!5. The Ist half of the film is like an overblown BMW commercial gone awry.That said, the role of Arav was clearly meant to be acted by somebody as cool and as collected as Bobby Deol. Nobody else could have channeled the character as much as he did, and many kudos go to him for that. Shah Rukh Khan would have overkilled a role like this and Akshaye Kumar would have made you want to commit suicide after watching it. Priyanka Chopra redeems herself after such silly roles in films like Karam, Andaaz, Yakeen and more by playing a role that could have been splashed to fit the life of 10 Indian women. She gets a clap for that. And Bipasha Basu having redeemed herself in the eyes of all those people who called her too fat to act, by dropping major pounds looks smashing in this film and the folks at wardrobe would stop at nothing to let you know it. At one point, you would believe that she has worn every possible daisy duke, mini skirt, and skimpy top left on the surface of the earth and she never ceases to look anything short of stunning in them. Needless, to say the three afore mentioned character are a love triangle. Priyanka Chopra does double duty in this film as she acts and playback sings as well. Extra kudos go to her for looking so beautiful and singing just as beautifully.My favourite line in the film is from the scene where Anna quizzes Arav at the BMW office.Anna: So, what's your sexuality? Are you Bi, Hetero, Metro, Tetro?Arav: Well, I'm very happy and gay!(It was a joke Yar! but very funny)All that and in the end, I blame Bobby Deol's Arav for everything that goes wrong in the film." 
" another rip-off","When everyone kept going on and on about how original this movie was I thought to myself, maybe it's worth checking out. Wrong, I should have ignored that thought and never have watched it. While the music is pretty good and I did enjoy it the movie was very unoriginal. I had not read anything about this movie and because I don't have time hadn't even seen too many trailers for it. Within the first few minutes of the movie I was like "Sweet Home Alabama". The beginning is almost EXACTLY like that movie with the dream sequence and the rest of the movie doesn't disappoint in 'borrowing' many other aspects from the film. They may have changed some aspects of it to fit a more traditional Indian storyline but it's practically the same. Difference, well instead of one girl and two guys this one has two girls and one guy, and the major difference, Reese Witherspoon, Josh Lucas and Patrick Dempsey are much better on the acting scale. I was hoping this one would be different but it's just another disappointment as are most Hindi films that are ripped off from English ones. I found this movie boring and predictable."
