" Very underrated Karan Johar production","Since the success of Aamir Khan's Fanaa there has been a surge of terrorist themed Bollywood movies, (A Wednesday, New York and now Kurbaan). I've deliberately left out My Name is Khan because it wasn't about the terrorist themselves but about how the common man is affected by their actions. I remember Yash Raj's New York came out now long before Kurbaan and was a pretty big hit. Maybe that's the reason why Kurbaan went largely unnoticed. Another reason could be that it lacks the hallmarks of a Karan Johar production. In a typical Karan Johar movie there's plenty of songs and dancing. and occasionally funny in places. It's a shame really because it's far better than I expected.Where Kurbaan excels is that it is a far more brutal movie than any of the terrorist themed Bollywood movies I've mentioned. In a typical terrorist themed Bollywood movie someone would come along and stop the bomb from exploding or the terrorist would have a sudden change of heart. In Kurbaan the bombs do actually explode and many are injured or killed. The highlight for was not any of the main leads(they were all great however) but it was Om Puri. I've never ever seen him act so serious in the movie but I suppose his role as the leader required him to do that. On a end note I would encourage fans of Bollywood to see this movie, you won't regret it." 
" A stylish Hollywood-mould thriller from Bollywood","Heavily influenced by Hollywood, there are a growing number of non-traditional Bollywood movies that eschew song and dance sequences and employ sync-sound rather than dubbing all dialogue. KURBAAN (aka Sacrificed, 2009) is one, particularly good example of this kind of new Bollywood film. Like so many Hindi films this does use a Hollywood film as a touchstone, but thankfully the source here (1999's ARLINGTON ROAD) is only alluded to in a couple of the plot points and beyond these the story moves in new, interesting directions that make this an interesting companion piece. Gripping for its two and a half hour running time, Renzil D'Silva's movie shares a few things in common with Kabir Khan's NEW YORK but superior thanks to it's consistent tone and credible characters and performances. Om Puri is particularly good in an extremely understated performance." 
" an action packed thriller!!","Many films in Bollywood have tried to bring out the topic "Global Terrorism". This one does the same.The difference about Kurbaan is that this movie was directed masterfully.There have been comparisons between Kurbaan and New York. Although the two deal with similar topic, both have a different form of approaching terrorism. Although there are a few similarities, it is not the same.Avantika (Kareena Kapoor) teaches at the university and falls in love with colleague Ehsaan Khan (Saif Ali Khan). The two get married and shifts to New York City. Life starts normally for Avantika and Ehsaan.But not for soon. There Avantika becomes witness to some terrorist operations in her neighborhood headed by a Muslim fundamentalist (Om Puri). Soon she realizes that she is a pawn to a huge conspiracy. She secretly seeks help from a television reporter Riyaaz (Vivek Oberoi) who attempts to infiltrate the terrorist outfit to foil their big plan.The movie initially portrays the love between the two leads swiftly changing its identity to a social film and it definitely engages the audience.Saif Ali Khan has yet proved his skills as an actor. Through the character of Ehsaan Khan he passes a very strong message to all of us. This should easily be one of Saif Ali Khan's finest performance after Omkara.Kareena Kapoor has certainly found the right track this time. After a box office flop(Kambakkht Ishq), Kareena has managed to bring out the best in her and has without a doubt delivered a fine performance and is a delight to watch on screen. She has managed to bring out the right emotion required, and has done justice to her role.Vvek Oberoi has come back with a powerful performance. Just when we thought he is out of Bollywood he has proved us all wrong. An outstanding performance by him has brought him back into the "dream world" yet again. He was easily the surprise element of the film.Rensil D'Silva makes a confident debut with his taut grip on the subject and confident direction. He is one director to look out for. Brilliant direction by Rensil has managed to grip the attention of the viewers.Salim-Sulaiman's background score with Arabic overtones to it enhances each scene. The soundtrack is soulful with justifiably no lip-sync songs, which work efficiently in the background.How can 1 ignore the magnificent cinematography by Hemant Chaturvedi. Every sequence was shot with brilliance and is just breathtaking.The movie is strong in every department and would definitely manage to strike a cord with the movie viewers.This movie is a must watch and should not be missed. Its not always you get to see such a powerful movie from Bollywood." 
" One of the good movies from Bollywood","I generally have no expectations from films that preach. Most of the films on terrorism do exactly that. More so, bollywood movies try to preach quite often, terrorism or not.So I successfully gave-New York, Fanaa a miss without regrets.But somehow I watched Kurbaan and it turned out to be a non-preachy good piece of art. Its a decent suspense thriller which will make the first-time-viewer think. It quickly moves from some romantic-love-story to conspiracy-theory without a preachy or sympathetic moral of the story - "its only-innocent-poor that are lured into terrorist activities." It sticks to the story and portrays the confusion of an individual who is torn between religion and his unborn child. Also a lesson for girls who fall prey very easily to romantic one-liners from guys who are very sacrificial for the girl they love. Beware of them and watch this worth-a-watch thriller." 
" A worthwhile experience in film","There are many films in Bollywood relating to Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism Because of its relation to terrorism, the movie has been extensively compared to Fanaa and New York. In the past movies such as Dhoka focused on the victimization of certain terrorists, individuals who want justice through revenge. Movies such as New York illustrated the formation of a terrorist and now finally Kurbaan illustrates how terrorism affects one's personal life. How does a terrorism affect the individuals closest to one? How are victims of terrorism affect? The answers are explained through the course of the film. In terms of performance Viviek Oberoi shines as he showcases brilliance. Kareena illustrates that she is indeed both a talented and beautiful actress,the role relied on expressions as much as her dialogue and she fits the role perfectly. Saif also exhibits brilliance and is the most dynamic and dimensional character in the film. Kiron Kher and Om Puri fit into their roles with perfection and Diya Mirza and Nauheed Cyrusi make an impact with their small appearances. The movie has wonderful flow and the 2 hour 45 minute film does not feel as long because each minute is utilized in terms of expansion of the plot.In terms of negatives there were some implausible actions that take place during the course of the film,particularly the end, where a cop is injured in a serious bomb blast and walks away with only slight bruises while everyone surrounding him is either severely injured or dead." 
" uneven thriller/romance","Though a native of India, Avantika (Kareena Kapoor) is currently a professor at a college in New York. On a trip to visit her ailing father in Delhi, Avantika meets and falls in love with another professor, the dapper and dashing Ehsaan (Saif Ali Khan). After a whirlwind courtship - which seems to take place in a slickly-produced shampoo commercial - the star-crossed lovers set up a new life for themselves as a married couple in the States. But all is not unadulterated marital bliss for the newlyweds, as Avantika quickly discovers that Ehsaan is, in reality, a secret Islamic terrorist who married her strictly as a means of getting easy ingress into the United States. The other major character is Riyaz (Vivek Oberoi), a war correspondent for a local news station, who allows himself to be recruited into the sleeper cell of which Ehsaan is a member.Though "Kurbaan" starts out as a fairly typical - i.e., overly cutesy - Bollywood romance, it quickly transitions into an admittedly bloated but moderately gripping action-movie thriller with serious social overtones. Perhaps because this is an Indian film, the terrorists, though by no means the "heroes" of the story, do get to air their grievances in a somewhat more sympathetic and even-handed fashion than they would were it an American-made production. On the other hand, like most Indian films, this one suffers from over-length and a tendency towards hyperbole when understatement might have been the better course to take. And while the Indian actors are all fine, the American performers leave much to be desired (perhaps the result of an Indian director, Rensil D'Silva, not being able to identify poor line readings when delivered in another language). In addition, the action sequences are often clunky and unconvincingly staged, especially when contrasted with something like the expertly executed "24."Yet, despite its flaws, "Kurbaan" combines suspense, social commentary, romance and clue-gathering in generally appropriate proportions, which makes the two-hour-and-forty-minute running time pass reasonably quickly." 
" Kurbaan is a good thriller","Rensil D'silva's Kurbaan is an edge-of-the-seat thriller that seldom loses its grip on your attention. Credible performances from its leads, and a nail-biting screenplay make up for the plot holes that threaten to eat into this otherwise engaging film. Set in post-9/11 America, Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan star as Avantika and Ehsaan, professors at a Delhi campus who move to New York after a whirlwind romance, that involves making out in the college staff room, and a prompt marriage. Avantika, who was teaching in the States prior to her stint in India, returns to her original job, and Ehsaan accompanies her, hoping to find a position for himself too. The couple moves into an Indian neighborhood in suburban New York, where Avantika stumbles upon the shocking secret that her husband is part of a sleeper cell of Islamic fundamentalist terrorists that's hatching a plot to bomb the New York subway. She enlists the help of a news channel cameraman Riyaaz Masood (played by Vivek Oberoi), who infiltrates the gang to foil their attack. More compelling than the similarly themed New York, Kurbaan scores for its brisk pacing, and for the fact that it doesn't offer an over-simplistic view of the terrorism issue. The film allows enough room for all perspectives and avoids romanticizing the terrorist as a victim seeking revenge, even if characters like Bhaijaan (played by Om Puri) and Aapa (played by Kirron Kher) make the same point repeatedly. It's in a dramatic classroom scene in which Vivek Oberoi's character Riyaaz confronts white students and their predictable logic, that the film reveals its neutral stance. The key problem with Kurbaan, however, is that it can't decide if it wants to be a serious film addressing a burning issue, or a commercial potboiler set against the backdrop of terrorism. How else do you explain such lapses in logic as Riyaaz's needlessly heroic decision to explore a possible terrorist situation himself, instead of alerting the cops right away? Or the terrorist group's decision to include Riyaaz in their mission without as much as a thorough background check. Even the love scene between Saif and Kareena, although aesthetically shot, has a distinctly 'filmi' logic - Avantika's seducing Ehsaan to get her hands on vital information that could prevent the attacks. Another careless oversight on the part of Kurbaan is the more-or-less insignificant role the FBI plays in all of this. Anyone who's traveled to the United States post 9/11 or even watched a handful of recent Hollywood thrillers will tell you that America became a different country since September 11 happened. Even a mention of words like 'bomb' or 'terrorist' could get you into serious trouble. Which is why it's a little alarming to note that Ehsaan roams about freely on the streets of New York without bothering with so much as a guise, when the FBI have clear photographs of this most-wanted terrorist. Or that he can walk into a bar and stab a man to death, or escape from a run-in with the cops. Just watch the recent Harrison Ford-starrer Crossing Over in which the FBI swoops down on a teenage Bangladeshi girl for a class essay she wrote in which she may have sounded at best 'casual' to the Twin Towers attack. These irregularities might be dismissed as nitpickings in an average masala entertainer, but they stand out in a film like this which prides itself on attention to detail and credibility of intent. Despite its hiccups, Kurbaan works as a suspenseful thriller, sucking you into its drama even though you may have figured out where the story's going. Refer to that terrific scene in which Ehsaan reveals his real identity to Avantika, or the one in which Riyaaz's secret is accidentally revealed to Ehsaan. There is genuine intrigue in these moments, and you're undeniably hooked. Kurbaan is convincing also for the remarkable acting by its three leads, who are a pleasure to watch. If Saif Ali Khan approaches his part with restraint and minimalist fuss, then Kareena Kapoor goes for a simmering, slow-burning performance that eventually punches you in the gut. Vivek Oberoi, despite the occasionally rickety accent, throws himself into the role and turns in a sincere, spontaneous delivery. As an ensemble, the trio turns Kurbaan into one of the best-acted pieces you've seen all year. Armed with Hemant Chaturvedi's efficient camera-work and Salim-Suleiman's rousing music score that never distract from the storytelling, director Rensil D'silva makes a confident debut with a film that is both respectable and engaging. It's a compelling thriller that doesn't shy away from touching prickly issues." 
" Very weak fare and a major disappointment, though with some good performances.","Kurbaan is a major disappointment for me. I expected much more from Karan Johar and was ready to see a powerful and moving picture. But it neither moved nor entertained me as I thought it would. Though the first half is fairly interesting, the entire suspense thing was a complete letdown. Once the so-called "secret" was unveiled, the movie became very predictable, and not even once was I particularly thrilled or shocked or surprised. The script is the film's weakest link. The film fails to convince the viewer. The romance between Saif and Kareena was not believable, the proceedings seemed unjustified by any means, the background of the characters was vague and the reasoning behind their actions was overlooked. At some point the film became overly messy and that too while being slow and boring. The film's subject was hardly evident in it and was seemingly used as a pretext. I did not see the point of the story and what exactly it tried to convey. Did you?Kurbaan's saving grace may lie in some of the performances. Some. Saif Ali Khan did not impress me here, he was sort of ordinary. Kareena Kapoor was pretty good in her role. She was likable and looked stunning throughout the movie. One performance that completely amazed me though was that of Kirron Kher. She was absolutely outstanding, and her dialogue delivery was natural and powerful. Vivek Oberoi was strictly okay though one must note that his role is underwritten. The film's soundtrack was very good. "Shukran Allah" is a nice song, "Kurbaan Hua" is also very good. The film's last scene was somewhat effective with good acting by Kareena, but a few pluses cannot save this movie, and the final verdict is average. Kurbaan may be a decent one-time watch but overall it is a great disappointment. It is best described as a wannabe thriller which lacks the power to captivate and enthrall. Watch it if you must." 
" A Surprisingly impactful thriller.","Okay, so I had seen a couple of time pass movies, all fluff no substance prior to this one. So I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, from start to the end, it never stalls or gets off track. Unfortunately the movie does little to break the western stereotypes for the Muslim male, which is what I thought it would do, at least to some extent. From gross DV, honor killing to sleeper cells, this movie/characters reinforces most of the stereotypes except for Riyaaz and her GF, played by the ravishingly beautiful Dia Mirza. I took away two points for one sided portrayal of the Islamic community in America. There should have been a couple of more scenes to show that majority of the Muslims don't fit the stereotype and that the characters shown represent a small minority. Overall it is an excellent thriller, one of the better movies out of the Johar stable. Highly recommend taking a look. Add 2 to the IMDb rating for a fair rating, the current rating grossly underrates the movie, I suspect it is due to backlash from angry Muslims, some of which is justified given the largely one sided portrayal of the Islamic community.7.5/10" 
" Not a must-watch, but decent otherwise","One of the slickest looking movies to come out of Bollywood this year, Kurbaan is worth a watch just for its high quality visuals. Rensil D'Silva and his team will vow you by their sheer technical brilliance - I cant remember the last time frames of any movie looked so good. And designer Aki Narula's wardrobe and overall look for Kareena adds a lot to the beauty of the movie – deep kohl lined eyes and rich Indian clothes (without a single hot pants or low-cut tops).Kareena gives one of her better performances as Avantika, even though she has very limited dialogues and screen time. Her eyes speak for her as she goes through emotions from amusement to happiness to despair and sorrow. She reminds us why she is one of the best actresses around today. And she completely outshines Saif in the second half, where he appears to be rolling through the scenes without much effort. However Saif is in his own territory in the first half, where he is the suave, confident dude who is trying to sweep Avantika off her feet. Their chemistry is sparkling and it is very difficult not to guess that they are a real life couple.Kurbaan is a love story of Ehsaan (Saif) and Avantika (Kareena) set in background of Muslim terrorism. Avantika is a professor of psychology in NY university, but she is teaching in Delhi university for a semester because her dad is recovering from a stroke in Delhi. There she bumps into Ehsaan Khan, a new professor at the college and soon they fall in love. However, she gets an ultimatum to return to NY for the next semester and Ehsaan agrees to go with her to the US – after marriage. And so they land up in New York.And all this happens in the first 15 min of the movie!Throughout the first half of the movie, pace is quick – almost frenetic. You get the feeling you are watching a thriller rather than a love story. The background score of the movie enhances that edgy feeling. And most importantly, logic is not sacrificed as most of the characters in the movie are more realistic – and not caricaturish. What they say or do makes sense – like the FBI is not just composed of Muslim-hating officers.Acting was a positive surprise – especially from Vivek Oberoi. He was much better than I remembered, and Kiron Kher does the Afghani accent exceedingly well. And a trivial issue, but when the police try to defuse a bomb, the wrong wire is cut and things go kaboom. Not like other movies where invariably, the correct wire is cut.Post-intermission, the movie slows down quite a bit, but the biggest failure of the movie is its climax. The screenplay abandons all pretence of logic or reason and its all senti-drama. Kareena does very well in the acting department, but Saif just sleepwalks through the role here. Given that there was lot of expectations from his negative or 'grey' character', Saif fails to get you sympathize in Ehsaan.Kurbaan is a more realistic movie that New York – but its not a Khuda Kay Liye either. What works for it is superb production values and the chemistry between its lead-actors – the spark between them is quite visible. But it is let down by the Bollywood philosophy of love above everything else. It would easily be qualify for 9 stars, were I to consider only the first half. However, it loses its way significantly in the second half and the stretched climax leaves a bad taste in your mouth.I regularly write about movies at http://bisprad.blogspot.com" 
" Premise lacks depth",""New York" & "Kurbaan".... seems like there was a race between the buddies Adi & KJo. The similarities are aplenty and let me not go there on a listing spree. Having accredited and acclaimed for one of the finest screenplay in "Rang De Basanti", expectations are bound to run high from Rensil D'Silva. Paradoxically in "Kurbaan" the screenplay turns out to the weakest link, owing to which the Titanic starts going down under with each passing reel. The DOP also needs to share the blame for giving it a feel of suspense thriller/ whodunit at unwarranted places.° Saif Ali Khan: The character seems to be a direct lift from "Fanaa". He puts up a strong performance however the the fallacies in the movie overshadow his effort. The smooth talking professor/ love story did not quite gel well.° Kareena Kapoor: "Love is blind, marriage restores sight" is an apt phrase to describe her character. Avantika appears to be either an emotional fool or fickle-minded. Poor writing indeed.° Vivek Oberoi: Not quite there.° Om Puri: The fundamentalist part of the character is straight lift from "Shoot on Sight". However he seems to be having a streak of poor/ impulsive planner.° Kiron Kher: Get the diction spot on and everything good ends there.° Nauheed Cyrusi & Dia Mirza barely had few scenes. ° Khulbushan Kharbanda's character was unwarranted. Coming from the house of KJo music is generally one of the strong points and therefore a few songs are quite good. There are too many coincidences/ cinematic liberties in the movie. Coming to the premise, the writing of KJo attempts to give a balanced view of both sides of the coin. Sadly the research is inadequate and can be aptly termed as school homework. The writing hardly manages to touch a layer or two at the most. The planning/ plotting/ execution - if the actual terrorists would watch "Kurbaan", they would fall of their chairs and die laughing." 
" Kurbaan moves through America like a sputtering train!","Actually, I saw Kurbaan in November of 2009 but didn't write a review on it until now. When I left the theater, I remember asking myself how much did Kurbaan move me as a cinematic experience. It has managed to stir our minds about the true roots of terrorism, but only in some pieces. Though a good movie, Kurbaan stumbled a lot to enthrall us, especially the first half.Nearly everyone got meaty roles. Om Puri sleep walks through the role of a 'leader terrorist'. It didn't even test a quarter of his acting calibre. Saif Ali Khan was brooding, tough & menacing. Vivek Oberoi showed the right balance of anger, fear & vulnerability in his performance. Kareena Kapoor gave it her best shot. She's a seductress in the steamy scenes. Other actors like Kiron Kher and Diya Mirza (inconsequential role, really) were impressive too. Some of the American actors were wonderfully natural, especially the confrontation scene between Vivek Oberoi and a white American girl. The girl was superb.Maybe it's the first time direction of Renjith but some of the scenes in the movie were 'choppy'. Let me explain - in the first half, Saif & Kareena keep meeting each other in every consecutive scene like as if they were performing on a stage! Scene A - Saif & Kareena meet at a cafe, Scene B - Saif proposes to Kareena, Scene C - they move to US. The editing didn't help make the scenes move seamlessly from one to another. I did feel I was watching a drama on a stage.The title song 'Kurbaan' is cool. And the way explosion shots were tackled was applause-worthy.Verdict - Doesn't engage you all the time but still, a very good directorial debut by Renjith. Watchable." 
" It lets you at least think","Well I have put a 9.0 rating because I did not expect this out of Mr Karan Johar. I really really mean it. The human stain - or the relationship is a delicacy, you can not mold it - use it for your use. That is exactly what this movie is all about.On a short scale - you have Saif betraying Kareena's trust. On a global scale - how many peoples trust we are betraying? Human fighting human in what cause? Nation against nation - for what? We as human race lost Afganistan, we are loosing Pakistan even. Frank Miller might be a strong proponent of WAR attitude - (I have tremendous respect for him for his work) but war is not a solution to anything.There is a proverb - the demon slayer becomes the demon itself. We should be very careful of that.50000 years of human history has taught us - no same human wants an war. Be it fought in the name of jihad - or in the name of nationality or national sentiment. And almost all the time it is this little unknown people - are dragged into it as part of collateral.I believe - this movie really illuminate the collateral part - brings the story of those who were dragged along in the someone else's bigger plan.Hats off to Mr Johar for getting this one up - at least one movie who stand up and against his earlier works. Hope to see some more of this caliber." 
" A Nutshell Review: Kurbaan","There are enough films churned by Hollywood which examines the contemporary war on terror, with offerings going as far back as 2005's Syriana, to the more recent The Hurt Locker by Katherine Bigelow, adopting viewpoints of the players at the fringes on either side, or those placed in direct combat duties. Films on terrorism are nothing new to Bollywood, especially when they tackle issues on skirmishes and conflicts between India and Pakistan, but lately, this exploratory net has been cast a little bit wider, and the net being thrown at stories taking place on US soil, and this year alone we have Kabir Khan's New York, and Renzil D'Silva's Kurbaan.The chief draw to the film though, personally I would feel, is the casting of real life couple Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor. Billed as a love story as well, their chemistry was instant, smooth, and just worked, playing a pair of lovebirds who spend the first forty minutes of the film romancing each other, starting off though on the wrong footing. Kapoor's Avantika and Khan's Ehsaan are teaching professors at a university, and like a typical Bollywood romance, comes with coolness and suaveness, with Kapoor at her element in being the aloof beauty, and Khan playing the persistent smooth operator, whom many will cheer for in his unorthodox tactics, and honey-coated words and phrases he uses to finally get Avantika's hand in marriage.However, Kareena's Avantika then begins to fade to the background with the tone of the film shifting to its more serious topics on terrorism, with bombings and sleeper cell meetings taking over the narrative, once the couple relocated to New York and settles at an Indian community, with the Indian Muslim neighbours all acting a little strange. The couple's lifestyle got rudely interrupted when Avantika stumbles upon her neighbours' dark secret and suffice to say gets put under house arrest. On a separate parallel thread, reporter Riyaaze (Vivek Oberoi) gets on a personal crusade against a terror cell involved in the killing of his girlfriend Rehana (Diya Mirza), and inevitably these two story lines are set to converge, which gives rise to the comparison with New York for its portrayal of how new recruits get spotted, groomed and assimilated into the entire ideology of hitting out in American soil.Which of course included ample scenes which show discrimination and prejudice against those who fit the classroom profile of a terrorist, and that infamous episode with Shah Rukh Khan at an American airport, is something of a teaser of such unhappiness can be channeled negatively into deep resentment. Renzil D'Silva also never failed to exploit opportunities set up in the story with heated classroom banter between US students, and the viewpoints of the Muslims in the film, stinging in delivery although one which will bring on plenty of cheers (like the audience I was with). However in choosing to present a more objective stand, these sledge-hammering, sweeping statements and mouthpieces down your throat also have their fair share of retorts in specially crafted scenes which preached against extremism, and the distortion of a peaceful religion. More so it tells on the hypocrisy of those who preach peace but are wielding guns themselves.And since this is a fictional story, some dramatic elements have got to be in place, and you'll have to suspend disbelief in the second half of the film. There are a few things here that aren't exactly modus operandi of sleeper cells, given that they welcome a new recruit with open arms (albeit with a tinge of suspicion) and allowing him to walk right into their martyrdom plans without a proper background check. Also, because of the way the story is structured sequentially to allow for certain things to happen one after another, it makes their terror plot a bit too amateurish for this day and age, unfortunately. Not to mention too that the cops are looking out for an international terrorist who doesn't bother to disguise his looks, and allows him to cross borders oh so easily. But as I mentioned, if these were taken into consideration, there would be no film.With religion still being regarded a sensitive issue and discussion topic here in Singapore, I think it's because of the way it more or less objectively portrays perpetrators and victims, their issues and reasons along with unambiguous rebuttals, that allowed this to be screened here, though an NC-16 rating for its violence and gore, with really ace looking makeup and animation to wow any audience. It dropped the usual song and dance routine, but only if the narrative was tightened could this measure up with its genre peers." 
" Kurban - Scientific Miracles and Movie review","Kurban pe koi mat hona Kurban. Its not that bad, you can go watch the movie and if you think its not going to be worth the money, then you can watch it in Single Screen theatres - Paisa Vasool!!Scientific Miracles in the movie: * Scientific Miracle in the movie, even thought you cant see the bump that Kareena Kapoor is pregnant, we are able to see the ultrasonography of the child. *There is plane blast which is of course done digitally, but then we do not get to see the flying debris, anywhere in the movie. * An individual person can always remember a 10 digit mobile number, even if the person has randomly met or spoken only once on the phone. * Everyone dies in one bullet, but only the actor-hero of the movie, after 3 bullets is still alive for 15 minutesIn a few lines, Kareena Kapoor (Avantika) and Saif Ali Khan (Ishaan) are teachers. She is a professor in United States. She was here in India, cause her dad had a stroke. But later in and then flies out to the USA. Saif tags along with her. Just too realise that Saif is actually part of a terrorist group that is conspiring to blow up the city. The movie that comes to the mind is Fanaa and New York.The movie takes its own sweet time and has its own pace. Sometimes, there is strong feeling of moving out of the theatre cause it is slow. But then, you also have the Kareena Kapoor who other than looking pretty, has not substance in her role. Her face is looking bigger or was it camera trick.Saif Ali Khan has done a better role in the Sriram Raghavan's movie Ek Hasina Thi and of course Omkara, there he was convinced us on the playing negative characters with complete ease. He slips here. For some particular reason, Vivek Oberoi had a good acting and lived in his character, with this movie, he surely be getting some push in his career.Lesser mortals in the movie Kirron Kher is an Afgani in the movie, her dialect an as Afgani trails away while she having the conversation. She was good in the climax scene of the movie. Om Puri was wasted in the movie, he should have had a much more impactful role. Others are not worth mentioning.If hockey got a boost from Chak De India, don't see teaching getting a boost in this case. But for one, you don't always have hot teachers in the staff room, cuddling or couching cooing. That is something I have to still see as a student or as a teacher.This is a good song and even the opening credits, though very long was well done!! Enjoy!!" 
" It would keep you in your seat","Overall the movie gives two messages: 1) The Non-Muslims should leave the Muslims alone. 2) 9/11 was carried by Muslims.But the fact is the it was not. And the whole world knows about, but a subliminal message is given in the movie that Muslims were responsible about 9/11.Yes both the good and bad side of a human society is shown in the movie i.e. the good Muslims and the Bad Muslims and i believe that it is common in every society irrespective of any religion.Om Puri is a superb actor and i have always been a great fan of him.One should watch this movie for the sake of entertainment, however this movie might bring up some emotional anger factors at some points."
