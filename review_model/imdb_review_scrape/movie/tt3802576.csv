" Hating Bollywood for no reason and saying Hollywood is great doesn't make your life look extraordinary awesome... So please Stop!!!","First of all I saw Warrior and it is great. I can see a lot of drama making people saying Hollywood is greater than Bollywood. But you know what, they have big budgets, developed technology and have discovered so much in Film Industry. Bollywood has nothing like that. So please think about it and stop comparing.Coming to this film, I so think that this is a good effort by Karan Malhotra remaking Hollywood to show Bollywood "Gawar" fans (Hollywood Lovers Think So...). >Akshay Kumar as David delivered best as 3rd film after Baby and Gabbar Is Back. He is doing awesome movies these days. His Training & Martial-Arts scenes are absolute breathtaking. Khiladi at his best. >Siddharth Malhotra as Monty is awesome. Just one thing kept dissing me is that he doesn't have a body like Tom Hardy has in Warrior but still manages to defeat by punching them once.You cannot digest this thing. >Jacquline as Jenny is supportive + a good wife and mother. >Jackie has done a good work too.There are some emotional scenes in the first part but the second just races towards end with a good plot scene. So if you haven't watched Warrior, this is the best thing you'll see. And if you have watched, better ask Hollywood attention diggers what to do!!!" 
" Very Good Movie ..... At Least Worth Your Time and Money","The Karan Malhotra Directed Movie is a Brilliant Mixture of Emotions and Action. Akshay Kumar-Sidharth Malhotra's Flick has the ability to grip your mind for the whole 156 Minutes. Karan Malhotra has directed it Brilliantly and the Duo(Akshay-Sid) has executed marvelously. According to me, Everything in the movie is perfect. From the Love of David for Monty to the Hate Monty Develops for the Elder Brother. The Tournament R2F is a revolutionary idea in the field of Street Fighting. The Villains and goons of the street become the hero of the country. For Me, The Fights of Monty were the best parts of the movie. Like how he knocks out the champion with just one punch and the next fighter within the first round. The Attitude of Monty was perfect too. Like How he Quits the ring even before the decision of the referee. Also David proves to be the most cleverest fighter of the tournament. He defends himself in the first and second round and then attacks in the third round when the opponent is tired. The Love of Jenny for David and the Affection of David for her daughter was remarkable. The guilt of Gary Fernendez, the hate-and-then-love of David for His Father, the Item Number of Katrina Kaif, The Choice of Fighters, the inspiration of the two brothers, the upsets of the tournament and everything was perfect and I would recommend this Movie as a must watch for everyone. I guess this is another 100-cror movie from Sidharth Malhotra after Ek Villain." 
" Worth a watch, don't miss","A movie which has emotion,drama,love,fight. Screenplay was good. may be there was some mistakes but that can be overlooked.. Music was good. "Sapna Jahan" & "brothers anthem" both are simply awesome but there was no need of that item song by Kareena Kapoor. AKshay Kumar is giving his best year probably. Uff what a superb actor he is & he was doing bad film like Entertainment,joker etc & was killing his acting skills. Hope he will do only sensible films from now on. Sid was looking like a beast who has no emotion, only knows how to fight, fight & fight & thats what his character demanded. Jackie Sroff, Asutosh Rana & Jacquline was also good at their small roles. Direction was good enough for the film. specially those fight sequences were really good. Overall worth a watch." 
" Really good remake and even better movie!","Let's get the obvious out of the way, brothers is not better than warrior and that's a good thing. First of all it needs to be noted that brothers is not a rip off of warrior but a fully licensed remake of the Hollywood movie. Now onto the movie itself. Brothers which stars Akshay Kumar, Jackie Shroff & Sidharth Malhotra in the lead roles is a movie which promises big things, and wishes to please many audiences and it succeeds exceptionally. The movie is able to set up an emotional back story for the lead up to main events of the film which is the R2F. What this movie does differently to warrior is it provides insight into the history of the the lead characters and the reason behind conflict, it also alters the story to suit a Bollywood audience and try a few things differently. The movies biggest asset is without a doubt the actors, each of the three leads are able to portray their characters with the conviction, emotion and physicality that is required of them. Be it Jackie showing us his regret and conviction, Sidharth showing his anger and motivation or Akshay who provides us his emotion and motivation, each actor excels in their roles. Special mention must be given to Akshay and Sidharth whose training has certainly not gone unnoticed and made the movie all the more engaging, which brings us to the next point the fighting is solid, this movie contains fighting like never before in Bollywood and succeeds and providing edge of our seat action. The songs of the movie are good setting up the emotions, back story or the training, however the Mary song seems to be there just to showcase Kareena Kapoor. The story and screenplay along with the script are superb and credit must certainly be given to Karan Malhotra for directing this movie extremely well. My only issue with the movie is that a few things could've been cut like the Mary song which feels forced and a waste of time, or been worked around to provide more. Overall this movie is a must watch for the story, script, screenplay and most importantly the actors who do full justice to their roles and will definitely be written down in their filmographys as one of the best films and a must watch. Do not go into this movie wishing to compare it to warrior because then you are asking yourself to not enjoy this, instead go into this wanting to watch a Bollywood movie that isn't your typical masala film and instead a family drama as well as a sport drama. Definitely a must watch!" 
" Really good for a one time watch","First things first. I haven't seen the English original,so I had the privilege to view 'Brothers' without having to compare every scene with 'Warrior'.'Brothers' tells the story of two estranged brothers and their father, who happens to be a former martial arts champion. A fateful night turns the life of these 3 people upside down and the rest of the film follows a storyline which cannot be deemed excellent but decent enough to be watched at least once.The movie does have its wonderfully shots scenes which are pretty touching for the viewer. A scene where Jacqueline shows her child's face to Jackie Shroff and the one where the younger Siddharth Malhotra gives food to his father are worth mentioning.Now to come to the acting bit.Jackie Shroff was the best of the lot(went overboard 2-3 times in the first half though),still was successful in accomplishing the task assigned to him by his director. Akshay and Siddharth had roles that required them to be really constrained in their emotions and act. Siddharth had his role in the same lines as 'Ek Villain' and was well cast. To talk about Akki, I guess there isn't an actor who could have performed this role, as it required Martial Arts skills to be portrayed on screen. Akki pulls off all the rigours of training way too effortlessly to be believable(he is brilliant in those), Sid doesn't lag way too far behind. Still was not as convincing as Akshay, which was further emphasized in the way in which the two had strategies for their fights!! Jacqueline had nothing much to offer but was convincing in whatever little opportunity she got to enact her bit. Kareena was wasted in a hopeless item-number.We need to put yourselves in the characters' shoes to feel their pain and agony,else the film may seem like a drag. All in all,'Brothers' is really good for a one time watch." 
" Don't waste your time while reading reviews, movie deserves your money.","My review for â€ª#â€ŽBrothersâ€¬Subtle act of Akshay, sensitive performance by Jackie and deadly punches by Sidharth, are reasons good enough to give it a dekho!!!they gave their 200% to it. #Brothers Has both DRAMA and EMOTIONS with a never seen before fight sequences... â€ª#â€ŽAkshayKumarâ€¬ looks like a real MMA fighter & â€ª#â€ŽSidharthMalhotraâ€¬ is so raw and outstanding, looks like he is the next big thing in bollywood. Superb climax, I cried #Brothers proved blood is thicker then hatred ðŸ‘Œwhat an epic second half. Third masterpiece in a row by Akshay this year. This year belongs to Akshay!! Hattrick!" 
" A Very Good effort","Karan Malhotra , the director of new Agneepath had impressed me with his intense and focus in direction in his first film. It was to the point and he has a knack of extracting great performances from his cast. But there is a self-indulgence in him which he is unable to control in some of the films important junctures. He had plenty of them in Agneepath climax and it is there in plenty all throughout brothers especially in first half. I don't have a problem with slow pace . It helps invest ourselves into the characters. I loved pace of Drishyam , gone girl, Shawshank redemption and so on. But I am not a fan of overstretched scenes which is the case in a lot of scenes of brothers. Jackie Shroff is a drunkard who has doting wife/son and a step son. we get it in the first instance. WE get the lives and turbulence of each of them in first instance. There is no need to slow down and stretch them so much. Karan has tweaked the character of tom hardy who had a rather coolness about himself that he dint care about any of his family members. here Sid is shown as a "dutiful" son which is filmy and reduces the complexity of the character. No fault of Sid Malhotra who has done very well in is role. The heart of the film lies in R2F ( meant to be UFC of real world) championship. The training montage of Akshay and Sid is awe- inspiring . The action choreography is not just brilliant but 1000000 MILES AHEAD of anything BW has given so far. But every time the adrenaline rush is poised to reach the next level, Karan squanders it by slowing the pace with irrelevant scenes. The fight scenes are so well choreographed but camera-work is not as good. What is the need to show expressions of Jacqueline and Kulbhushan Kharbanda in between, every single time? who cares how they are reacting! we want to see the fights uncut and in flow. The real coolness and brain of brothers is thanks to Eric Brown and Micheal Leher, the action choreographers. Thanks to these two talented people that at least each of the fight scenes has a unique personality and attitude in them. Siddharths fight scenes are about not just about brute force . They reflect a personality of one kind of fighting style. He views his opponents like his brother and thinks of ways to knock him out as fast as possible. While its the reverse for Akshay Kumar. His style is a different personality by itself. His signature moves are about exposing weaknesses of the fighter and then dominating them with technique. In this process, he allows himself to take a few blows if needed. I wish the film was directed by these two instead. Akshay Kumar takes his acting notch above baby and comes up with a subtle yet intense performance. His acting in climax is superb and he is at the peak of his career as an actor. Sidharth Malhotra is avg in first half but comes into his own in the second half. His scene with Jackie Shroff asking him to about the dilemma of his sons is brilliant. Jacqueline is very good as Akshays wife and gives realistic performance though her scenes were just not needed in second half. Jackie Shroff shouts , whispers and irritates in a role which needed someone more mature like Paresh Rawal may be Brothers is a very good effort to remake warrior but it is not entirely satisfying . it could have been a real masterpiece after baby. But its not a film to be missed because of strong performances from Akshay and Sidharth Malhotra. and of course the eye pleasing action scenes for the action junkies" 
" i would suggest watching movie Warrior before this.","i was a bit angry, and was my primary reason for writing this review.the main thing i can say about this movie is that its a total worthless copy of the movie Warrior, i mean the basic thing about any movie is its plot and story and if u cant even get your own plot or story then u probably should stop making movies.And really its not that India doesn't have good writers or good stories to be told, so why copy.Besides copying the story from another movie lets review the other things. its got great songs that i gotta say no doubt on that. and the direction is pretty good too. the acting i gotta say was not that up to the mark but then again i automatically start comparing it with the movie Warrior which was phenomenally directed written and the actors did pretty amazing as well." 
" A good family drama and watchable entertainer for many reasons","BROTHERS Review- After watching trailer i was thinking,why did they give 'Brothers' title to this film. Now i got my answer after watching this movie. A complete mixture of good story+quite interesting screenplay+good listen-able music+family emotions and kick ass action scenes. Movie starts very slow, took almost first 30 minutes to settle as if we can easily watch movie after half an hour. Then movie takes pace, involved us in their story and suddenly interval appears. 1st half left us with excitement what will happen in 2nd half and then 2nd half glued us to our seats till the end. 2nd half never drags for a minute. Martial art training scenes, fighters fight and little bit thrills completely immersed everyone in the movie. But i really think the climax could have been better don't know why makers did not think about any other way to end the movie. Anyways its not that important cause these things are avoidable. Acting wise Akshay Kumar and Siddhart Malhotra both delivers power packed performances. I repeat both delivers power packed performances not quality performances cause their characters was made to do so. We all have seen Akshay doing martial arts many times before but this time its much bigger and Siddhart also joins him this time. Jackie shines all the way with his old dramatic role. Jaqueline role is small she didn't got too much to do but still whatever she has done is quite okay. Other star cast were strictly okay. Music is not huge hit but each and every song is situational so leaves much better impact. 'Gaaye Ja' sounds one of the most melodious song in its particular scene. 'Mary' is catchy massy song and plays much better in theater. Overall a fairly good music to movie's genre. Screenplay was very loose in 1st half but very tight in 2nd half. Movie runtime is 155 minutes long and its not useful at all. They could have easily reduced it by 10-15 minutes. Direction is fairly good, He already had remake in hand so he doesn't have anything to try any experience. Still he has made a fairly watchable movie. Overall a good entertaining family drama with never seen before martial arts in bollywood. Its like experiencing fighting show in theater. I don't think anyone will leave theater with disappointment. Being an Akshay fan i say its must watch movie but being neutral i say its not must watch but definitely an one time watch for all. Only kids and senior citizens can skip it otherwise its for all ages and for all kind of audience. Go and watch this 1 time watchable entertainer and enjoy your time. 7* stars by me :) (y)" 
" Brothers is a remake of WARRIORS but it is no WARRIORS","If you look close, one in every four movies from akshay kumar is a remake, yet he fails at this one terribly. It goes without saying Sidharth Malhotra is no TOM HARDY. Akshay Kumar can be credited for 10% of what Joel Edgerton did.The movie starts out at very slow pace and fails very bluntly when it picks it up. Actors work is not commendable but they did make an effort for their looks, female leads are mere props. Jackie Schroff plays a pretty good drunk, maybe he was when did those shoots. Story is similar to WARRIORS with the few shakes here and there you expect from bollywood.All in all, there are better things I could've done over the weekend instead of watching this grand faliure of a remake like FINDING THE MISSING EMPIRE OF ATLANTIS or SEARCING FOR ALIENS." 
" Use your Right to Stay Away!","No offense is taken if you have opted for a plot full of hard clichÃ©s but treating it like one is a big bad crime. And Karan Malhotra is a serious offender of doing so in his official remake of WARRIOR- a punch full fighting action drama from Hollywood. In fact, he has been accused of the same in his first venture AGNEEPATH- another remake, this time of a Bollywood blockbuster. Thankfully, the 100 Cr indemnity at the box-office saved him from facing the heat. My prayers go straight to him for his latest sin. BROTHERS is as painful as the heavy and heartless punches in the ring could possibly hurt a regular man. It is so formulaic in its melodramatic emotions and in the laziest cinematic treatment that as an evolved movie-watcher, you would feel disgusted, snubbed and insulted for whatever intellect you could bring along. And the worst part is, you pay for it.Catholics are the most ill-treated (in their standard portrayal) and idly-written characters in any typical Bollywood film. You don't need to ask for their names or surnames as they are all the same. Any Fernandez or Braganza will do. Even David and Maria are a better connect. And then, put the holy-cross all around in as many ways you can. Tattoos look cool, on Catholics. They can be freely shown drinking their guts out. Isn't it a must in their religion? Putting merely a 'Man' at the end of a sentence and replacing every other word with its English translation in a Hindi sentence will positively end all the doubts of them being a Fernandez or Braganza or a D'Souza. If you are being impatient to typecast the Catholics, you sure should rush to Karan Malhotra. He is the one-point source to anything and everything related to them. He is the next Mahesh Bhatt in this particular field of interest.Now, let's look at the plot. The alcoholic Senior Fernandez (Jackie Shroff) is released from the jail after serving a life term for accidentally murdering his loving wife (Shefali Shah). He is the man seeking redemption for his sin. So, the tears need to be constantly in supply whether it is the matter of 'khushi' or 'gham'. By the way, fighting is the family game of the Fernandez. The elder Fernandez (Akshay Kumar) has left it long back for the sake of his family and is now leading a regular low life. The real Fernandez (Jacqueline) plays the better-half of the reel Fernandez. What a cheesy trivia! The younger and step-Fernandez (Another Malhotra, Siddharth) is angry, very angry. Enters Mr Braganza, the filthy Lalit Modi of MMA (Mixed Martial Art) league! The hunt for the champion of the league will also witness the biggest clash in Indian fighting scene. It is blood against blood.Gavin O'Connor's WARRIOR was a perfect film for Karan Malhotra to remake. One could smell from miles as how he is going to adopt it. The melodrama is on its highest. People cry, shout and walk like zombies-on the-loose to release and reveal their stressed present and stormed past. The writing is all impudent, brazen and audacious, especially in the second half where running commentary of the event covers the most of the part. Songs are relatively more comforting and that doesn't include one of the most the nonsensical and nasty item songs featuring Kareena Kapoor Khan. My takeaway from these dance numbers is the fact that no matter how titillating they are in nature, the people around in the song don't bother to 'bother' the lady in the middle. How gentle, polite and tender Indian Men in front of camera can be!At the end, I know it is not the end. Many have taken an oath to keep the histrionics of old bollywood clichÃ©s alive till they are in business. Karan Malhotra is just one of them. The other Karan (Johar) I am sure will get busy in finalizing the deal of another remake for him, soon after confirming BROTHERS' weekend collection at the box-office. Brothers in crime! If you don't want to fight with your conscience, use your right to stay away! Written By Gaurav Rai for Bollywoodirect" 
" good movie with top class action and emotions","I like the movie very much. I was xcited for this movie. Movie is little slow in first half. But I don't get bored. When 2half starts and the tournament begins then the whole audience in the hall can't hold their whistle and claps. Especially in that punch from monty in his first fight of tournament. Akshay kumar is simply outstanding he plays the role of David. His action seens look real. Sid also good at the movie. Jacqueline was also good and Jacky sir give his best. The last fight give me goosebumps. Movie was really good having best action scenes that never seen before in b.wood. A must watch Family entertainer for u all." 
" Slow and boring","So its an official remake of Hollywood flick Warrior..Really?? Well its hard to believe Because not in a single frame this movie is even half as close to Tom hardy" warrior.i never had a huge expectation from this movie but still i went in the theater with mixed expectation since i had really liked warrior.Where warrior was very well written and executed,brothers on the other hand lacks that treatment.Warrior was so intelligent and brothers is so dumb.Till the movie reaches interval,we all were wondering what is actually happening and then the second half came which was even more dumber.It has a weak plot that did not progress and eventually it collapsed down under its own weight offering just some blood shedding action scenes,but i would recommend you to watch TNA any time.This movie is simply avoidable,go and watch warrior instead.The music is also very boring and couldn't hold well for the movie,Siddharth had tried to act hard but all in vain.Its unimaginative how such a bowl of movie can be made from a movie like warrior.LAst time the combination of Karan Malhotra and Karan Johar worked well for Agneepath,but sadly it could not happen this time." 
" Karan Malhotra's direction is wonderful. He has integrated the action and emotional scenes very beautifully and his use of intercuts is simply remarkable.","Akshay Kumar portrays the angst of an estranged son/brother very effectively. If he is very good in emotional and dramatic scenes, he is simply splendid in the action sequences. He looks every inch the character he plays. Sidharth Malhotra is also very good in a subdued role. He lets his eyes and body do the talking in several scenes â€“ and to good effect. He is excellent in the MMA fights. Jacqueline Fernandez springs a surprise in a non-glamorous role and plays Jenny rather well. Jackie Shroff is absolutely outstanding in a tailor-made role. He is terrific in emotional scenes and may well bag nominations, if not awards, for best supporting actor. Shefali Shah is fantastic as Maria Fernandes. She shows that she is one of the best, in the scene in which she first meets little Monty. Baby Naisha Khanna is cute and endearing. Ashutosh Rana is a delight to watch. The scene in which he abuses David's opponent is superb. Kiran Kumar is good in the role of Peter Braganza. Raj Zutshi and Kavi Shastri are just too lovely as the two commentators. Kulbhushan Kharbanda deserves distinction marks for his wonderful acting in the scenes showing his nervousness while watching the R2F tournament on television.Ajay-Atul's background music is extraordinary. Hemant Chaturvedi's camera-work is remarkable. Justin Yu and Eric Brown's action sequences are of the kind never before seen on the Hindi screen. The fights are literally breathtaking. SurÂ­esh Selvarajan's production designing shows an eye for detail. Akiv Ali's editing is excellent." 
" Outstanding! Will win ur heart! A definite watch.","This movie is certainly d best sports drama of all d ages! With a right amount of action and emotion,,this movie is sure to win the heart of every moviegoer. The second half is actually the best part which has a high octane action sequences. Well directed,and superbly acted,,this is a worth watch! Akshay kumar is sure to add more fans to his kitty with d way he has acted! Sid,jackie and the other fighters ,,everything is just amazing! However, there is melodrama ,,but it suits the texture and theme of the movie. The music of d film is mesmerizing. At a point of time,u might shed tears because of the strings of emotion flowing. And at the end u will come up with saying "yes this is outstanding! Don't miss this,,I personally recommend." 
" Supermen & Drama. â™¦ 44%","2015 has been a terrible year for Hindi cinema. The official remake of the hit Gavin O'Connor film Warrior (2011), Brothers is a solid example to prove that the previous statement is, in fact, true.An alcoholic martial arts trainer (Shroff) accidentally commits a crime that sees his whole family fall apart, giving rise to a rivalry between his two sons, which is irreverently taken inside a wrestling ring. The revelation that one of the two sons was born out of wedlock was the cause of the crime, and continues as a driving cause of the whole story. Now all grown up, David (Kumar), the elder son, is battling for a better pay as a high school teacher, moonlighting as a fighter, to fend for his daughter's critical disease while Monty (Malhotra), alcoholic junior and chip off the old block, is still not over his decades-long familial issues and does specifically nothing for a living. In an international mixed martial arts championship that blooms out of nowhere, David and Monty fight it out through the tough line- up to end up in a one-on-one finale.I can disclose anything and everything about the film and no one can accuse me of being a spoilsport, because the title itself blurts it out loud what and how the film's climax is going to roll out. There is a lot of melodrama before things actually start to make sense, and by the time it culminates with a predictable ending, one wonders what the film was really about. Was it about the rivalry? Was it about the blood relation? Was it about fooling the audience? The happenings inside the ring are literally unbelievable and while most films in this genre try to wrap it up sooner, this one here has the whole second act dedicated to it. Although the production design is greatly supportive, the fights happen back-to-back, where these so-called supermen flex few muscles and show like they toil harder than Chilean miners by eventually winning. And they want us to believe that. Arr, not happening.Shroff acts fine, but is too loud for his dull character. Malhotra looks confused and seems to be thinking about why he chose the project. Kumar looks hungover from playing the notorious vigilante in his previous Bollywood potboiler Gabbar is Back (2015).BOTTOM LINE: Brothers is a faintly engaging family drama attached with a random sport. Avoid.VERDICT: 4 stars out of 10. Another remake bites the dust.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
