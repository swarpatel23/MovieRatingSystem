" A visual treat - Best Bollywood sequel ever","Vishal Bharadwaj's Dedh Ishqiya offers legendary Maduri Dixit the perfect platform for a comeback. Arshad Warsi and Naseeruddin Shah as Babban and Khaalu are entertaining as they were in Ishqiya. Their chemistry is cracking, sizzling, an absolute delight to watch. Madhuri Dixit-Nene is ethereal and absolutely ageless as Begum Para. When you watch her on screen dancing and singing, it's almost like you are savoring a glass of good wine that lingers delightfully on your palate. Huma Qureshi holds her own amidst a set of great actors. Director, Abhishek Chaubey creates a grander plot this time as the story, plot, look, feel, characters and music are interwoven intricately.Possibly the best Bollywood sequel ever made." 
" Urdu poetry,ghazals aur begums..... Kya Waqt tha","An interesting tale the story begins with Begum Para (madhuri) who hosts a festival of music and poetry in her palace. In that comes Khalujaan (naseer) as a Prince but his real motive is to woo the widowed Begum and settle in the palace. But his accomplice Babban (arshad) wants to return to their stealing profession. However, he also is struck by love looking at Muniya (huma), the confidante of Begum Para. What happens from there forms the rest of the story.The director has come up with a romantic storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was quite absorbing. The dialogues were well written. The script was above average and the screenplay made it lot better. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the royalty while the art department was majestic. In performances, Naseeruddin Shah was exceptional and equally competent was Madhuri Dixit, she has not lost her beauty yet. Arshad Warsi was versatile as ever and Huma did well as the rough but raw and sexy girl. Vijay Raaz was impressive, Ravi Gosain was neat, Shraddha sizzled in her item song. Others did their bit as required and added value.The film happens to be the sequel to the super hit movie Ishqiya and this time the concept and plot gets more complicated and intense. The first half goes on an entertaining mode with elements of romance and other light emotions but the second half gets serious with the various twists and turns. Overall, the film strikes due to some impact creating performances, tempting sexuality and the rich technical values." 
" It will be a cult classic in near future","Like Khulujaan I am also a patient of love, in love with Good cinema & was thirsting to see a good Hindi cinema for the last four months. Finally my thirst got quenched by Dedh Ishqiya.What was expected from this sequel (or predecessor as one of my friend rightly pointed) – the likable camaraderie between Khalujan & Babban; impeccable comic timing of Nasseruddin Shah & (under-rated as always) Arshad Warsi; dark quirky humor; shayerana Ada; katilana femme-fa tale; crime amidst rustic old-world romance; manipulative characters... You will get to see all of these, probably dedh goona zyada (1 n ½ times more)...&This stylishly written twisted comic thriller scores with its absorbing narrative & well edged characters that keep you hooked to the proceedings & there's rich cinematography to compliment it. With the plot revolving around poets wooing the begum you can blindly expect some captivating sher shayaris & the film scores here as well. Luckily for the ignoramus lot (like me) SUBTITLES were thrown in to grasp the "lufth" of the Urdu mehfil. The dialog by Vishal Bhardwaj are wacky & intelligent as the Characters wittily play with words; nowadays that's something as rare as searching for logic in a 200cr film. Kudos to Bhardwaj & Abhishek Chaubey for the screenplay; & obviously Gulzar Saab for the lyrics.. The background music is one of the most effective ones in any recent Hindi films.. Prasad' editing & Pande's cinematography worked magically just like Khulujan-baaban (or Para-Muniya) combo that uplifted the mood of the film.And yes this time you have two Begums with the power to bring out a shayer in every Men with no hormonal infirmity... Madhuri Dixit - Nene & Huma Qureshi, ufffffff!!!!!! (And Madhuri mesmerizes in two dance sequences)... Both of them did justice to finely written strong female characters that's also an aberration to usual stuff served to us off-late. The lesbian angle depicted through shadows was a masterstroke... Mr Chaubey, looking forward to see more films from you...Naseeruddin & Warsi are rock solid as usual. Manoj Pahwa & Salman Shahid gave commendable support in their respective cameos.And then there's Vijay Raaz , one of the finest & under-utilized actors of Indian cinema who seemingly lighten up in every scene as Wannabe Nawab Jaan Mohd.. If he would have been in the west then Coen brothers would have surely lapped him...& academy would have been waiting for him..And talking about Coen brothers, the film does seem to be heavily inspired from their films specially the one where Jaan's henchmen & Khalujan-Babban points guns at each other for the whole night in the middle of a road till dawn breaks in. The two parties parted off only when they heard an assembly prayer coming from a primary school near-by. And the brilliant action sequence in the climax, where we get to hear a haunting classical song playing in the background & things happening in a slow motion. The sequence was a tribute to Coens as well as Tarantino at the same time..To sum it up I would quote a line from one of the leading Indian critic's review - "Like heady wine, it delivers a welcome kick."..To all those who complains of dearth of Good Hindi films give Dedh Ishqiya a shot, u might not regret it....This is called "Intelligent Entertainment"...P. S : The 6th stage of Love is Junoon which is similar to "chutiyapa" as it's followed by Maut..well suicide as some wise guy said..." 
" League of Extra-ordinary Not-so-gentlemen !!","Perfect dialogues...perfect acting...what else does one need in a movie...Vijay Raaz, Arshad Warsi and Naseeruddin Shah create magic on screen with their characters !! Khalujan and Babban are the modern Jay Veeru of Sholay. Its a dark comedy through out with a tinge of love in urdu. Its definitely better than the first version. Madhuri has still the charm to carry movie on her shoulders at this age..its a dream comeback for her. She looks great in most of the frames. The dance choreographed by Ustad Birju Maharaj and the lyrics of poems are simply extraordinary.Its Huma Qureshi that matches the league of such wonderful acting cast to perfection. She is here to stay for long long time.The only flaw of the movie was the songs did not match the previous version.If u liked Ishqiya you will be a fan of this movie.Trust me,you will be surprised." 
" Worth the hype..","An esteemed reviewer for a leading newspaper had commented that the movie spent a long time staring at Madhuri Dixit. Yes, it's true. From the moment she stepped on to the screen, her iridescent beauty threatens to overwhelm the viewer. I felt like she didn't have much to say in this movie. Not enough dialogues for her. But, she is one actress that doesn't need dialogue to stop from emoting and expressing her feelings. As beheld in the song Jagaave Saari Raina, she didn't sing. Just expressed. Naseeruddin Shah's character had expressed it rightly. She became dance. Madhuri's portrayal of Begum Para was nothing short of perfect. The slight hesitation in speaking that comes with royalty (thehraav), the inborn dignity, the chewing of the paan, the show of polite humility yet steely resolve. In many ways, it was reminiscent of her Chandramukhi, but without the tawaif background. She was simply breathtaking.Playing her sidekick, Muniya, is Huma Qureshi. Her best friend, her confidante, her shadow. She could switch from chaste Urdu to crass Bhojpuri which was fantastic, along with her comic timing. She is not afraid of using sex to get her way. Huma, in a gang of acting stalwarts, made her own mark on the film. If she doesn't get nominated for Best Supporting Actress in Filmfare, I will eat my hat! But, of course, if movies like Dabangg and Chennai Express win Best Film, the future of Bollywood cinema and awards is shaky.Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi teaming up again for the adorable Khalu-Babban pair is nothing short of classic. We have seen a lot of such before, but not with such realistic portrayals. Their acting is top notch! One cannot find flaws in the performances of the thieving Uncle- Nephew pair. They give and take with all their hearts. Their daredevilry, dialogue delivery, wit and charm are what makes this movie an all rounded entertainer and a classic. Naseeruddin Shah's switching of character between a thief and a Nawab impostor is absolutely fantastic. One minute he would be spouting poetry, and the next minute he would talk about sex. It was crazy! Absolute fun! Arshad's tapori act, one minute begging for mercy and the next minute being the 'bhai' walking on thin ice, was just delectable.Vijay Raaz plays the villain, Jaan Mohammed. In most Hindi movies, one ends up forgetting the villain. But not this one. At certain points, he overshadowed them all. His rustic evil plans, his comedy, his lust for control and so many things.. Things I can't reveal for fear of ruining the movie... *sigh*A short synopsis: Khalu-Babban get separated while doing a jewel heist. Thinking that Khalu has conned him, Babban goes in search for him. He finds Khalu posing as a Nawab in an event thrown by the Begum of Mehmoodabad, Begum Para. The Begum's erstwhile husband, apparently, expressed a desire on his deathbed that she should remarry a poet only. The most renowned poets from all over the country have come to win her hand. Khalu is in love with the Begum and Babban falls in love with Muniya. Throwing a spanner into the works is Jaan Mohammed who wants to marry the Begum. At the end of the event, she announces her decision to get married to Jaan Mohammed. But she gets kidnapped. Now, what happens next is for you to find out. There are a couple of twists in the movie. Trust me, they will deliver a Knock Out.It's not often that I get to see Hindi movies with such powerhouses of talent to steer the ship through. I laughed out loud and shed a couple of sad tears too. It is much better than the previous Ishqiya, but, of course, I am biased here. This movie is not a regular run off the mill movie. Vishal Bhardwaj and Abhishek Chaubey have come up with a brilliant movie, deserve to be remembered.But the Indian audience, as usual, sucks. They are still too busy watching Dhoom 3, instead of something much more fun and original as Dedh Ishqiya.Trust me, go watch it. It's money well spent. You won't regret it." 
" A joy ride with a lot of twists and outstanding acting","I have always been a great fan of how Vishal Bharadwaj can make dark comedy with such ease and beauty. After watching Kaminey, Omkara and Ishqiya, I went to the theater with great expectations and I was not at all disappointed, rather amazed and more than satisfied... The dialogues and the delivery are fantastic and not just that, The movie takes on some very subtle issues like ego, love, misconceptions, personality ethic and a lot more and that too with sense of humor that is subtle yet so powerful that every line that the actors say have some deep meaning in them... Naseer sahab has always been one of my favorites and praising his acting would mean critiquing a monalisa, however the pick of the actors for me were Arshad Warsi with his bhopali humor, Madhuri Dixit beautiful yet so powerful and of course Vijay Raj ,the villain, who although has a big ego fails to earn the respects he yearns for so much.... All in all it is a 9* experience according to me, with the drawback that there are no famous songs, as in ishqiya, which i so much expected from Vishal bharadwaj... Its intelligent cinema, with a mix of humor and darkness... It tries to rip of the character behind the faces that we tend to wear... I think this is one installment of bollywood this year that would be hard to beat... You should take a walk into the dark humorous world of dedh ishqiya.." 
" great sequel surprisingly..","i was not sure about this movie as most Hindi movie sequels .well suck mostly.. and after loving the first move i thought they would repeat the stuff we loved and make it bad. but the star cast made me watch it. and i was surprised because it overwhelmed me and went over my expectations multiple times. its not many times you see a realistic movie like this in bollywood but only sometimes these guys catch you with surprise and give you a masterpiece like this. naseeudin shah is one of my favourite actors and huma is the new sensation who everyone likes these days . including me. both gave a strong performance and arshad was as usually good but not great. so this is movie which people have to love as it makes you laugh, makes you screem and all that other stuff that good movies are supposed to do. so what are you doing reading this review. go out and WATCH IT NOW." 
" Better than the first!","I was skeptical about this one due to couple of reasons. The first ishqiya had a confusing plot (while interesting) and Vishal Bhardwaj is known for darker movies based on his previous work (kaminey, omkara). But dedh ishqiya is neither dark nor confusing. The plot is a lot more linear keeping the audience interested and gripped. The movie was surprisingly hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions.The chemistry between the actors, Naseerudin Shah and Arshad is fantastic. Not enough could be said about Madhuri who makes a sizzling come-back. Huma is good as well. All in all, Dedh Ishqiya is a complete film filled with a great script, taunt execution and tantalizing performances. The only drawback is the Urdu dialogues which I found to be acceptable due to the Nawaby setting but may not sit well with some viewers. If you are in the mood for comedy, thriller or even romance, don't miss Dedh Ishqiya!! 9/10@in2deepjagani" 
" A Cult - Must Watch for Every Genuine Movie Lover","Dedh Ishqiya is cleverly written and brilliantly executed; it is the perfect comeback vehicle and tribute to the only true screen goddess Madhuri Dixit. Apart from Madhuri's heartfelt performance, Dedh Ishqiya will always be remembered and referenced for its brilliant direction and storytelling. The movie is smarter, funnier, richer, and way more gorgeous than its prequel Ishqiya. The writing is brilliant, screenplay immaculate, and direction flawless. Dialogues were quirky and all the lead as well as the supporting actors performed really well. Kudos to the director.Now speaking about the main attraction and the lead character of this movie Madhuri Dixit who essays the role of Begum Para, one has to admit that she was, is, and will remain THE BEST actress as long as Indian cinema exists. Her luminous smile enchants, her dance captivates, and her mischievous glance casts spell magic on audience.They say the soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone..I never got it until I watched Madhuri Dixit in Dedh Ishqiya. And it is apt to say "Always pray to have eyes that see the best, a heart that forgives the worst, a mind that forgets the bad, and a soul that never loses faith in God".Don't miss the rare opportunity to watch this gem of a movie and the timeless Madhuri Dixit." 
" A Brilliant Sequel!","A sequel of the 2010 hit Ishqiya, 'Dedh Ishqiya', written & directed by Abhishek Chaubey, is A Brilliant Film! A top-notch screenplay along-with fantastic direction & stellar performances, make this one a massive winner!'Dedh Ishqiya' Synopsis: Two wanted con-men fall in love, while on the run. Trouble follows...'Dedh Ishqiya' is gripping & arresting. The characters are well-written, the poems are perfectly pitched in the narrative & the sequences, most of them, are hugely impressive. The romance works, the humor works & the thrills work. In short, Abhishek Chaubey's Screenplay is top-notch. A special mention for the wonderful dialogue written by Vishal Bhardwaj. Abhishek Chaubey's Direction, on the other-hand, is fantastic. He captures each moment with flourish. Cinematography is royal, just like the film's mood. Editing is pretty sharp. Art & Costume Design, are appropriate. Music by Bhardwaj is melodious. Performance-Wise: Naseeruddin Shah & Arshad Warsi reprise their roles from the prequel & they are in complete form. Naseer is endearing, while Arshad is simply flawless. Also, The on-screen chemistry between Naseer & Arshad, is magical. Madhuri does a commendable job. She carries off her part with grace & elegance. Huma Qureshi is splendid. Vijay Raaz is outstanding as the menace. His performance stands out. Manoj Pahwa is excellent.On the whole, 'Dedh Ishqiya' works big time!" 
" A perfect entertainer","Look at the star-cast.. the ever beautiful Madhuri and ever green Nasiruddin Shah and you'll be drawn to the cinema halls itself. Add supporting comedy of Arshad Warsi and the new Bollywood beauty Huma Qureshi and you've got the perfect star cast for an entertaining film. Movie is full of comedy, romance and quick-witted dialogs. There's some abusive language which is expected in a Vishal Bharadwaj film to give that so-called realistic touch. Script is good, and each actor has given his/her best. Film has good music with Madhuri's dance... :) Overall it's a perfect entertainer with all the drama, music, comedy, action and romance! A good start of the year for Bollywood. Do watch ishq ke saat makaam! :D" 
" A true-blue romantic masterpiece!","This is one of those movies which is at par, if not better than the prequel... The story builds on slowly and surprises when you start predicting and think "I-know-what will happen-next." Remarkable performances by the whole cast..It will be a crime to not mention Arshad and Huma's amazing performances, amongst stalwarts like Naseer and Madhuri. Lots of exemplary shayari and black humor keeps you entertained....It takes you on a trip to a different world of royalty, deception, conspiracy, chivalry, and tainted love. The screenplay and direction are crisp (fits the mood well), amazing locales and cinematography . On the whole, this is a must-watch.... But not for those who don't like slow- moving stories and are weak in Urdu (you'll need either subtitles or an Urdu dictionary." 
" A Flawless Eye Candy Seuqel","'DEDH ISHQIYA' a sequel to 2010 film 'Ishqiya' is one of the best and the finest example of a Sequel ever made in Hindi Cinema. The Nawabi Feel of Madhuri & Huma against the rustic Naseer & Arshad are well synced gives us a delicious lyrical Noir. Superbly Shot & Directed, The Chemistry between Arshad & Naseer is Stupendous. While Madhuri & Huma were charming all the way, Vijay Raaz gives another strong performance and proves again that why is he a great actor. Music is great and well synced with the film, Screenplay is smooth as silk (154 Mins) passes away in a jiffy. Arshad Warshi shines in the film, and delivers his one of the best (Very Rare Though) Huma Qureshi's attainment was impressive. Madhuri Dixit leaves you speechless with her Beauty. It's film not for the masses, but for the classes on the roads of Masses. (4.5/5) Zara Apne Nazdeeki Cinema Gharo Mein Jaiye aur Iss Cinema ka Lutf Uthaiye!" 
" Thankfully, the year began on a promising note for the Hindi Film Industry. Thanks to Dedh Ishqiya for that.","Thankfully, the year began on a promising note for the Hindi Film Industry. Thanks to Dedh Ishqiya for that.This is a film that you will like to watch with your boyfriend or girlfriend (whichever is applicable) or spouse. Coz, there are some moments which will linger in head, long after you have seen this film. They may spice up some moments in your romance.This film has subtitles. Thanks to the language used which is more Urdu than Hindi. I believe that since "Umrao Jaan" this is the first good attempt. The film works for the acting. Naseeruddin Shah is effortless. Arshad Warsi is the hyperactive Babban whose wit is hilarious and the spontaneity stupendous. Also they are ably supported by Huma Qureshi and Vijay Raaz and host of others. But above all others I give in to Madhuri Dixit as Begum Para. I love Madhuri Dixit and her dance. Thankfully, she dances and just those 5 minutes of her moves are divine. She has a divine grace in dancing and is surely one of the best dancers for screen. Thanks Madhuri for dancing superbly after a hiatus. The camera work is superb and even the editing is good. At least there is no nonsense. Dialogues by Vishal Bharadwaj and his team are exemplary. In fact the best I have heard in a Bollywood film in long time. Direction till the climax was wonderful and it fell flat in the climax scene. Apart from that, I have no big qualms from this. I am going with 3/5 for a good movie. It may not work for everyone but love and desire have always worked for me." 
" Dedh Ishqiya oozes sensuality, making it an exquisite watch","I went in there expecting to be completely swoon over by the film; to testify all those lavish praises being showered on the film; and to truly watch a film close to perfection. And weirdly enough, this is exactly what happened. It's really rare for films to meet high expectations but Dedh Ishqiya is superlative in every possible me, making it irresistible for me. This time, it's less crude. In fact, barring two grossly unneeded vulgar scenes, this film was clean and so, so majestic. The atmosphere created, the charm of Begum Para and Mahmudabad and the essence of the poems brought the film in a different space altogether. It almost felt like I was watching a cult-classic. This time, Babban & Khalu are more focused and more mature. This time, the whole saga actually makes sense. This time, the Ishqiya may be spice-less but it's more refined - the old charm was brought back with this film through Iftekhar & Begum Para's love track which was sheer magic. Hands down, this Ishqiya is more than 1 1/2 times better than the prequel.Dedh Ishqiya, in many ways, is the coming of age of Khalujaan and how he discovers himself & his goals in life. Dedh Ishqiya is about how the two men happen to meet their female counterparts and the chain of events which get triggered from there on. The story starts off in a zany way to introduce the characters, proceeds very slowly to let the audience grasp everything and then changes gear to a second half loaded with suspense, romance, heartbreaks and brilliant subtle humour. The exuberant climax - albeit slightly underwhelming - works as a fine culmination.Abhishek Chaubey seems to have worked on his flaws from Ishqiya as he churns out a very polished and superior product. In fact, you could easily believe that Dedh Ishqiya was directed by a Vishal Bhardwaj from 2006. And this is a huge compliment.The technical aspects of the film are bloody good. So much attention to detail. Everything, right from the cinematography to the camera work to the choreography to the dialogues excel. Urdu has never sounded so royal. It was beautiful to listen to, and the Shayaaris were excellent. The music, by Vishal Bhardwaj, gels well with the film. The songs are unconventional, classical and used to their potential in the film. Kya Hoga is a personal favourite and it's utilisation gave me goose-bumps. Jagaave Sari Raina, the second dance track performed by Madhuri, works because of the Begum's unparalleled talent.Unfortunately, no amount of praises will be able to make this film a hit. It's not made for the mass. Add to that a really slow pace and self-indulgent narrative, coupled with language barrier, I don't see Dedh Ishqiya making much headway at the Box Office. In addition, while the film has been smartly penned, the audience might be used to some more spoon-feeding. There are some smart dialogues, silent looks and unsaid things which are meant to be understood. The flaws aside, I was hooked. Major credit goes to the actors, who all give it their best shots. It is obvious that Dedh Ishqiya was conceived keeping Madhuri Dixit in mind. This film was not just made for her, but it was made for her to shine. And she does just that. Madhuri was the scene-stealer for me. She was mesmerising and intoxicating. It's one thing that she looked so ethereal that it felt so wrong to take my eyes off her, and by default ended up appreciating her acting more than the rest, but truth be said, she truly was brilliant in this role. Just look at the volumes her eyes speak throughout the film. You can see her pain, her willingness to break free. Her little glances work like magic in a film like Dedh Ishqiya and the much-needed ada comes so naturally. Begum Para's dance in the film was magnificent thanks to Madhuri's expressions. It wouldn't be erroneous to say that right from her dialogue delivery to her posture, Madhuri moulded herself completely for the role of Begum Para to emerge as a total winner. This was one a subtle, beautifully underplayed performance which should win her laurels next year. Had Dedh Ishqiya released last year, there'd be no competition at all as far as I'm concerned. Watch out for the scene were she breaks down, and starts scribbling on her own pictures. No one can top that.Next on my list would be Naseeruddin Shah. This man has still got it. He pitches in a perfect performance as the love-struck Khalu jaan. Huma Qureshi, the dark horse, won me over. She's a complete natural, making her acting look effortless. Vijay Raaz, as the shrewd calculating and determined nakle Nawab rocked and has some classic dialogues to mouth, almost taking away the focus from Arshad, who's in charge of the humour. Arshad Warsi is in terrific form, but somehow has less scope than in the prequel. His scenes with Muniya are brilliantly hilarious.While this might not be everyone's idea of a nice-time out, Dedh Ishqiya truly is a cult-classic. It's poetry on celluloid. Dedh Ishqiya oozes sensuality, making it an exquisite watch. If you want to be proud of the Hindi film industry, I'd highly recommend Dedh Ishqiya. Give it time and let the spell charm you. Box Office wise, not much to be expected, but I hope the film clicks with its target audience. Dedh Ishqiya is one of those films which will transcend beyond a Hit or Flop status. The acclaim coming its way and the recognition which will hopefully follow should easily make this film one of those few films we will always be proud of. Highly Recommended" 
" Dedh Ishquia is worth watching","Watched today. The movie is better than what we had expected before watching. After long time bollywood releases such a nice really watchable movies. Script and acting of all the actor actress is very strong. Dialogues are in urdu, but they have given subtitles in English. However the urdu dialogues are movie's demand. The Khalu and Babban pair once again done a fantastic job. Director had never seems to loose his grip on the movie from starting to end.Every scene of the movie reflects its relevance and you will never feel that this scene was actually not required. The best part of the movie i like was the story and dialogues. Don't miss to watch "Hamri atariya pe aja re swariya" at the end of the movie."
