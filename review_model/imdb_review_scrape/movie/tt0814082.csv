" Don't Expect Much","Dil Diya HaiMy God, this is probably the first movie ever, that I gave a bad review too. I mean it's not my fault, there is so many things wrong with this flick.Emraan Hashmi plays Sahil who sells his client to a pimp. Soon, he must save her.The Pluses: Good Music, Good depiction of London, Patel's corny jokes, Geeta Basra :)The Minuses: Dumb Plot, So many plot holes (Why does Emraan hashmi have to worry about saving money for an operation, doesn't the UK have free healthcare; Who in their right mind forgives the person that sold them, I know I wouldn't) DUMB Typical Indian movie ending (Bogus Action, Emraan Hashmi fighting everybody at once, He's not Sunny Deol)Overall, Dil Diya Hai is for those who are dumb and think that physics has no existence. Emraan Hashmi was okay, even though I can't believe he associated himself with these films. Geeta is pretty though you don;t see her much in films much anymore. Ashmit was annoying. Mithun should not have done this film. I give this film a 5/10." 
" Nonsense!!!!!","Avoid this film if you are looking for entertainment.It is filled with wannabes trying to be something that they are not and Emraan is just wasted in the role of a tour guide who falls for a newcomer who needs to go to acting school. Seriously, where to they get these people from? Just because you're pretty doesn't mean you can act or should be an actress.Asmit Patel needs to send an apology letter to everyone who accidentally watches him makes a fool of himself in this poor excuse for a film. He plays an insipid wannabe gangster who drugs girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them off to the highest bidder." 
" Nicely made movie.","This is a small budget movie from Aditya Dutt whose main focus rather than movies is showing flesh. He has pulled in Geeta Basra a beautiful newcomer for the lead role. The story is quite old and traditional similar to those Baaghi, sadak etc. The only difference is that here the heroine is sold off by the hero and then saved by him too.The catch line of all Emraan's movies are nice songs, nice story lines. Though the story has been told again and again, but the presentation is the main strength of the movie. Geeta does justice to her role and if everything goes well, she can make it as one of the good stars of bollywood. Ashmit Patel has done a memorable performance as the main villain of the movie.The story goes like this: Emraan Hashmi is a travel guide who falls for beautiful Geeta who has come to London with her parents and sister. His mother is sick and he needs money to save her. He tries to arrange money from all source but fails, then he sells Geeta to Ashmit Patel who is a brothel owner. But after selling her off also, he couldn't save her mother. Thinking this as to be god's punishment to him, he decides to save Geeta. With the help of Mithun, he finally saves Geeta, but at what cost? Mithun Chakravorty and Kittu Gidwani plays a very significant role of a couple who plays a husband and wife who loves to help people in distress. In all a nice movie." 
" Great movie","Once again Emran Hashmi brings out such a fantastic film.Starring alongside is a newcomer to the bollywood industry, the very beautiful Geeta which originally is from London,this is her first role and i must admit i was very impressed by her acting skills and her lack of talent, she Will be a really big star ina couple of years. The story on the other hand is really interesting as we see Emran in a different light.It is about a guy who falls in love with a woman but his mother is dying and she needs 30,000 dollars for an operation, which Emran's character sells the woman for the amount stated.The music once again is outstanding with Hamesh's vocals. That is only the icing on the cake you will have to watch the movie to find out how the story progresses.I guarantee you will not be disappointed." 
" disappointment diya hai","This movie is an example of small budget,ineffective star cast,weak storyline and poor entertainment. This kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard fans of bollywood movies. I went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also. Only thing I appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way, she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das. she is good ,sexy and acting well. she definitely go up in her career. our mithunda was all time good at his work .atleast he has some good to the movie. I didn't like imraan for his role must advise him to improve himself now as he has done many movies as new actor and he has been seen as established actor This movie has nothing except the bold scene done by new actress Never try this movie" 
" Dil Diya Hai is a good one time watch!","Dutt's 2006 Flick 'Dil Diya Hai' is a decent entertainer. Average at best. The story of the film is not interesting,but however the filmmaker manages to make a decent film. The film has its share of Pluses and minuses. An Okay fare.Pluses: The Performances are good. Mithun Dada continues his Legendary magic with Dil Diya Hai. He's fantastic. Emraan Hashmi is good. Ashmit Patel shines in a Grey role. Geeta Basra looks amazingly hot and does a good job. She's sexy. Kitu Gidwani is good. The music of the film is excellent.Minuses: The script is below average. A veteran actor like Ranjit gets wasted. The film has unwanted bad words.On the whole 'Dil Diya Hai' is an average watch. Watch it only if you've got nothing to do." 
" A love story accompanied by nice music and dances","As an admirer of the Indian movies I could say that this is classic representative of this genre. Besides the love story, nice songs and dances the movie intended to turn our attention to some of the deepest shortcomings in our civilized society and in some way it succeeded. However the movie is a bit longer than ordinary user can take and some people, even I, could find it boring. Some of the scenes and dialogs are quite ordinary, unduly protracted and look framed up. All together Dil Diya Hai is a traditional Indian movie and deserves the attention of this genre's admirers but I am afraid it could be misunderstood by the other viewers."
