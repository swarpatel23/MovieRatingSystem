" Abysmall B-grade sleazy thriller from Vinod Pande","Wonder what has come over Vinod Pande who had backing of good credentials to come up with a thriller which is nothing short of B-grade semi-porn sleazy outing. Vinod seems to have stumbled upon a book and the plot very much akin to desi version of James Hadley Chase. Not only the plot, the screenplay, the dialogues and the narrative resembles a book. Add to that the plastic performances of the actors namely Sherlyn Chopra, Deepshika & Harsh Chayya, the end-result is a B-grade lookalike. Only Deep Raj Rana manages to put up a convincing show. However navigating the hunter to fall into the lap of the hunted is extremely lame. The supposedly smart conversations between Sherlyn and Deepshika is perhaps the lowest point of writing. The motive of "Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde" is very-very lame.You can do better than this, Vinod!" 
" Red is Blood","This is a psycho thriller as pointed by Vinod Pande. Vinod Pande is famous for making films with controversy and sex.This movie is no exception. Just before the release of the movie, the leading lady, gave a press statement that she can go to any extent to make a film work or work in a film.She keeps killing people after having sex with them because of her traumatic childhood. But then the movie is nothing new. In the initial portion, the film reminds you of Basic Instinct but then it moves beyond. She is gang-raped by a few men on the road. She got pregnant out of the person she loves and a kid from him who left him. The kid dies in an accident. This makes her go mad about men. And she keeps choosing her victims, have sex with them and then murders them. But apart from the murder, sex plays a very important role in the movie. I don't know how the censor board hasn't raised any objection to so many bold scenes. The movie is OK. I don't think it will do much for Sherlyn Chopra the leading lady."
