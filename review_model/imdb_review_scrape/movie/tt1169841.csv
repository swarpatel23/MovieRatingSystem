" Bajrang Dude....","I recently discovered "Returns of Hanuman". Now I really regret that why didn't I watch it on big screen. And thats the reason that ROH didn't do well on box office cos we all missed it on silver screen. I am very much sure that ROH would be discovered by larger population in near future (and its becoming a trend with all Anurag Kashyap' movies).ROH is not a master piece but I will say it is a first brick in the wall. I hope this would inspire many others and soon we will watch our own high budget animation movie. Actually I got scared after watching Koi Mil Gaya, Krish etc. cos it was starting a wrong trend. But ROH breaks that notion and promises a bright future of intelligent Animation/SciFi movies.Though ROH is a sheer mimic show of bollywood, mythology, politics etc but still I found it fresh and creative. Movie has got nothing but a mind blowing pace. Script of ROH takes lots of pressure from other departments because of budget constraints and Anurag smartly handled it.Thanks Anurag!! Keep it up!!" 
" The funny side of Hanuman...","The film begins with a disclaimer, stating that RETURN OF HANUMAN is not a sequel to any film made before. But is it really possible to watch the new experience forgetting all about the first part? As someone who thoroughly enjoyed HANUMAN, you expect an encore with RETURN OF HANUMAN, although the makers, for reasons best known to them, have decided to alienate the new film with the first animation film on Lord Hanuman. The makers may have their reasons, but for the viewer, the comparisons are inevitable. Write your own movie review of Return Of Hanuman Honestly speaking, one shouldn't compare the two films for a very valid reason. While HANUMAN was a pure mythological film, RETURN OF HANUMAN merges mythology with the present-day kalyug ki duniya. In this film, there's Gabbar Singh, plus voice-over clones of, hold your breath, Shah Rukh Khan, Sanjeev Kumar and Raaj Kumar. What's more, Baby Hanuman handles a volley of bullets like Keanu Reeves handled them in the MATRIX series. RETURN OF HANUMAN begins with the battle between the gods and rakshas. The focus shifts to a small kid, Minku, in a small village in present-day India, who's ridiculed by his friends. Lord Hanuman requests Narad Muni to convince Lord Brahma to send him to earth. Lord Brahma agrees, but Lord Hanuman is made to sign a contract, which has several do's and don'ts. It's innovative to merge mythology with the contemporary and a number of sequences do make an impression, especially in the first hour. But the film drags in the post-interval portions and a long-drawn climax only dilutes the impact of several interesting sequences." 
" Mathology Meets Matrix","The movie starts on a note of matured Lord Hanuman seeing the well being of earth, and deciding to take avatar in regular human form. He is made to "sign a contract" by Lord Brahma, the creator, who let him go.The story had a pace in the beginning, with a mystery about the "other side of the wall", but later on, it died in the monotony of the plot in the later half.Even with a dragging second half, the movie has a freshness of concept and a right mix of modernity and mythology.The songs are not catchy though, but the scenes are impressive. This movie marks the start of CG era in India, with lots of fresh concepts.This movie gives a message about pollution control in the end, which sounds a bit out of place, but could have been improvised.Bottomline: Watchable movie" 
" a foreigners comment...","I see that only people from India has reviewed this movie yet, and generally, they all liked it. However, I am not from India, and I didn't like it much.I don't know if my opinion only a matter of cultural difference, or is there something beyond that, but i assume it's the later.When I saw it at the Animaton festival at Annecy, there were a tremendous hype around it. There was even a kind of wager about it. It seemed as the movie makers were really prod about their work, and wanted us to see them as the pioneers on Indian cartooning, which has (thanks to them) became a cultural force to reckon with...On the other hand, one of my friend told me, that this movie is beyond horrible, and I will leave the screening before the the film reaches it's half. ...Well, since I trust my friend more, than strangers at wagers, I had really bad expectations when I actually decided to watch this movie. ..but it wasn't all that bad! I wouldn't call it good, but I'v seen much worse! Unfortunately still, this movie is pretty bad, somewhat beyond mediocre. Don't forget that I'm talking from an European point of view, so there might be some cultural references I just didn't get. But there ARE some things you can measure to international values. I'm only gonna talk about those things.What did I expect when I went to the screening? A lush, exotic looking film, with a storyline that might make sense, but I surely wont understand due to major cultural differences. What did I get? A film that looks like crap, with an understandable plot which however doesn't make any sense.Really this film looks as it has been designed and animated by Jetix channel animators. And if you know Jetix, you know it has pretty low standards. This is just inexcusable in a full feature movie. The 2d and 3d parts doesn't blend well, the editing is boring and uninspired. That's especially true for the action sequences. I mean, come on!!! A matrix spoof in 2007 ?! And a so badly executed one! The character designs could also be better, they're generic, boring, and looks as if they were made for separate movies.The story consists from way too much story lines and characters, and none of them has enough time to develop properly. There is a little boy, who's getting his ass kicked by bullies, there is Hanuman, a monkey-looking god, who transforms into a little boy, to help out the earlier little boy, and later on they discover some mafia activity, and there is a war going on between heaven and hell, and there is some sort of a natural disaster at the end, due to pollution. Again, less would be much more. And all these lines trigger some totally unimportant characters with needless roles (for example, Ghandi makes a really out of place cameo. That's another problem, none of the puns and spoofs blend into the story well enough. At most of the jokes, I could almost feel the director nudging my side and winking at me saying: "hehe, good one! get it?") The story is followable, but falls apart due to the lack of a proper editor and scriptwriter, who should've CUT the movie heavily. If they'd have cut the majority of spoofs and at least two of the plot lines (or add two more to make it even wackier), this would be a really good family movie. I still say, there might be vast amounts of cultural reference I missed out, since I don't live in India. But that's exactly the point! I saw this movie in France, at an international animation festival! The movie makers seemed WAY too overconfident about the international release of their work. It falls short on international expectation. This is just not enough to make us notice Indian animation. It's not a bad start (way better than for example " a Fox's Tale " which were also made to international release, but flopped everywhere, with a good reason), and I'm really looking forward to upcoming Indian animated movies, but it's gonna be a long, and hard road until Indian animation reaches the level of international recognition." 
" Incomplete Credit","Although this is a follow up of a so called landmark Indian animated film, the animation crew isn't credited here?"
