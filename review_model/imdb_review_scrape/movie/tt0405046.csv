" Hackneyed script and subject","Sure, this movie may have a strong storyline, but how many times must we see it?  The story of a woman getting raped and her revenge on her rapist is such an old idea; I don't know how many times it has been retold. Namrata's acting isn't that powerful anyways.  Dino Morea didn't really have much of a role, so he was overlooked.  Sanjay Suri had a bigger role, and he did a decent job.  There are so many extraneous scenes that don't contribute anything to the movie.  Oh, and the songs are awful.  That is where the fast-forward button comes in handy.  Even though it was just 2 or so hours long, the movie seemed much longer.  It was so predictable since the story isn't anything new."
