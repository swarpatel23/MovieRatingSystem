" Go for it...entertaining and useful movie that makes sense","Interactive story full of some wicked twists and turns, this describes the movie in a nutshell.The name makes it quite obvious to judge what the movie is about and this is where the surprise lies. It gets better than it's name and goes beyond what you could have derived from it. In a way this can be called a suspense drama.The story keeps you hooked and direction never lets you guess what's coming next. Starts off with a happy tone where two young people want their single parents to get married. Though it is a bold subject in Indian context the treatment to this has been so graceful, it actually justifies the efforts of the youngsters. Breaking taboos and stigmas in a very light hearted and cheerful way, the movie makes you wonder and ask questions. It makes you take sides while you enjoy the marriage celebrations.Now once the older couple is settled in, the dark side of the movie comes in to surprise you. The kids, both outgoing, independent and straightforward start enjoying each other's company a notch more than normal. It might ruin it for you to know that they fell for each other and what makes it uncomfortable is that they are bother and sister.It seems wrong on so many levels and this is when the human ability to handle emotions are best portrayed. If you though falling for each other is the climax, you need to hold on as the film goes through some intense and intimate moments that completely change the tone of the movie. Two shades of grey in one movie.Will they go for their happiness?? Will their parents ever allow this?? What is that they can com up with to be happy and still acceptable in society. Well that is for you to find out, but one thing is guaranteed you will have a roller coaster ride in there.Serene and meaningful music calms your nerves in this high voltage content based film. Powerful performances by the leads and an equally amazing performance by the rest of the crew makes the movie a class act. A very mature and reasonable treatment to the subject makes the film a must watch, because when you get out it isn't the film that you will think it is the questions that film asked will be in your mind.You won't walk empty handed, something you will take home after this movie. Go for it, laugh and cry with the characters and have a good time because the movie is worth it"
