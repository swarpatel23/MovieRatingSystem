" A relevant movie for the times","Lately, Bollywood has churned out movies with tremendous show of skin and exhibitionism, but this movie is such a stark contrast and is one of the reasons that it works.  In this movie they have dealt with the age-old issue of children not willing to take the responsibility of their parents when the parents are considered "useless" by their children.  Although we have seen such movies in the past like Avtar and Amrit, but what is different about this movie is the way they have shown the romance of an old couple.  I can't remember seeing such romance in any other Hindi movie, so it is refreshing to see that even an old couple can have youthful romance. This is one of those movies that makes you think and analyze your relationship with your parents.  As one's parents get older their habits get formed and many times members of the younger generation (myself included) get angry at them and I felt how important it is to overlook the immediate state of your parents, and instead to reflect on how they have toiled in bringing you up.  Another question that arose in my mind after watching the movie was whether parents have children so that they have someone to take care of them or do they have children without any ulterior motive.  After having discussions with my Mom (in relation to this movie) I realized that, yes, everyone does have expectations, but that's not the reason that they work so hard to build a child's future.   In fact, as a child, we have expectations from our parents through our dependence on them, so why should we accuse them of wrongdoing when we have similar expectations.  It is human to want to be loved, and that's the least we can do for our parents.  Well, after reading this lengthy philosophical discussion you can see how thought-provoking this movie is. Let me get back to the movie.  After a long time I have enjoyed watching Amitabh Bachchan, and Hema Malini's performance was so subtle and yet she gave a powerful performance.  There is one scene in particular, where she tells Amitabh to have his medicine (right before they get separated) and one moment she has her eyes shut and the next moment her eyes are filled with tears.  In this movie I didn't find much melodrama and the dialogues are hard-hitting and are to the point.  Finally, the performance of Paresh Rawal, is, as usual, very good.  I hope everyone watches this movie with their families." 
" A remake of one of the great and most heartbreaking films of the 1930s.","Back in 1937, Hollywood made a film that is today considered a real classic...though in it's time it was seen more as a little, lower budgeted picture. "Make Way for Tomorrow" is a tragic story about a husband and wife who have worked their entire lives for their children...only to find that the kids aren't there for them when they get old. It's a truly heartbreaking film to watch yet really works because of the amazing story as well as the direction by Leo McCarey--one of the great directors of his time. Well, Bollywood often remakes classic or contemporary Hollywood films and "Baghban" is no different--adding the usual Bollywood music and style to the terrific and sad tale of two parents with ungrateful children.When the film begins, the Molhatras are celebrating their 40th anniversary. All their friends and most of their family (their adopted son is abroad working and '''studying) come and they do what every Indian family apparently does (at least in Indian films), they have a giant song and dance-filled night. It culminates with one of their four grown sons asking to borrow some money--and Raj (Amitabh Bachchan) very generously gives it to him. After all, he's their father and for decades he's been giving his boys everything he and his wife, Pooja (Hema Malini), have. Despite the Molhatras being so generous, or, perhaps because of it, this soon spells trouble. Raj is about to retire and he simply assumes like the average Indian that his kids will quickly offer to have he and Pooja move in with them. The problems are that they have never really saved up for retirement and they cannot keep going on has they have...and the boys are ungrateful wretches. Each has an excuse for not taking in the parents and they offer a lousy option instead--each parent can move in with one of them...separately! So what's next in this sad film? After all, you learn all this only halfway into this picture. What of the Molhatras and what of their brats? Well, in the Hollywood film, it pretty much ends here...so it's up to you to see how the two films differ.One of the biggest and most obvious difference, apart from all the song and dance numbers, was the choice of stars. Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini) look amazingly young...perhaps too young. By contrast, victor Moore and Beulah Bondi LOOKED very old in the Hollywood film--- though Bondi and Moore were actually close to the same age (and Bondi was the youngest of all). This is because the Hollywood actors were made to look as plain and simple as possible-- whereas Malini and Bachchan were still very beautiful people. I'm 51 and would LOVE to look as youthful as they do here in "Baghban"! I think using B-list actors like Moore and Bondi actually worked better in making the couple seem realistic and believable.But to me, THE biggest difference overall was the second half of the film. The original story simply stopped with the oldsters having their lives torn apart...no happy ending, that's for sure. But in the Bollywood version they did what most Bollywood films do...end with everyone happy and the story neatly tied up in a way that is satisfying but completely unrealistic. I liked this film but having seen the original, I can see that it's only a pale imitation in many ways." 
" an old story comes a time when it really has to be retold","Baghban - the first curiosity came with what the name rely meant. And the second curiosity was that could Hema still look so stunning!! The second one was yes she can!!! And as for the first one it came after watching the movie. I understood why its meant to mean the caretaker or Guardian. The movie is trying make a metaphoric relationship between an individual and their family and comparing it to a garden.  Your family are like a garden, you have to slave over it and look after it for it to flourish and thrive, and any neglect will result in a weeded unattractive piece of earth. But the relationship that one has with their garden is very interactive - the gardener will put all their effort in trying to get a thriving garden and in turn the garden will reward the gardener with a sense of achievement, and fruits of labour.
This is the topic that Baghban is tackling - family life, and more specifically the life of the elderly. All their lives, our parents thrive the give us the best, to ensure all our wishes and dreams are achieved, to ensure that our lives are given more priority over theirs. But in this modern world what is excepted in return? Maybe the saying is true - nothing is free is this world - not even the love from your parents. Can we say that there is an expectation from our parents that we should look after them in their old age? Is it a sense of duty? NO - it is essence of humanity and gratitude that we should foster and love those that have loved us - and should not be obliged to do so but cause we want to do so. If we look around us there are so many children that have been abandoned, abused or neglected - so we should be grateful that we are not one of them and its are parents that are responsible for it.
The essence of this story has been integrated into Baghban with Amitabh and Hema being the head of the household. Both churning out wonderful performances. It was great to see Hema after such a long time and looking still fab as memory recollects from the 70's. Amitabh delivered a wonderful performance as a hurt, angry and confined old man, and its good to see such roles being written for him.  The pair together brought a sense of love and comfort not seen onscreen for quite some time. Their four sons and their families give out appropriate performances and help to pull the movie along. Also the guest appearances are good and adequate. The show stealer has to be Paresh Rawal. Indirectly or intentionally the guest appearances and Paresh characters iterate the fact that friends you can choose, but family you can't - and in times of need it is your friends that stand by you and not your family.
The story has been told many a times before but maybe because it is made now at a time when such a message has to be iterated again, or it was the combination of direction and acting that made this a memorable experience. The movie has its down points, but they are thin and varied and can be expected when tacking such a subject in a such a short time.  In all it is not a good movie, it's a great movie, but remember take your box of Kleenex with you." 
" Mixed feelings: sometimes moving, sometimes overdone","Baghban is generally good, thought-provoking and moving, but it's never outstanding. This is the story of Raj and Pooja (Bachchan and Malini) who are married for over 40 years and have four sons living in India and one adopted son living abroad. The first half portrays the love of the entire family and particularly the longstanding love of the elderly parents. But then, when Raj retires and asks their children to take care of him and his wife, they get a shocking reply. The sons offer them to live separately, each spouse with another son, and change residence every half a year to another son. This is quite unbelievable and unrealistic. Would any child have had enough courage to act so cheap with their parents and separate them despite knowing how much they love each other? I don't think so. I was surprised that after all, the parents decided to accept their children's senseless conditions. I wonder, how is it possible? Why wouldn't they have stayed together in their house and forgot about their children? Well if they had done this, this film probably wouldn't have been made, so that's pretty sums it up.And that's the particular period on which the story focuses: the first six months they live separately, Raj in the house of the second son, and Pooja in the house of the elder son. The film portrays their loneliness and suffering without each other, but most importantly shows how they discover the true colours of their children. Their children don't care for them, treat them badly and don't show any respect. Their daughters in-law are even worse. This part of the film is only reasonably well-done. The main problem with this entire concept is that you wonder how come they never get to meet during these six long months. Before they moved, they always had parties and dinners with the entire family and now they suddenly don't? Are they in prison or what? The saviour comes in the form of Salman Khan, their adopted son who literally worships them. I did not really understand the need to show such an enormous love from Salman to his parents. It was, though ironic, extremely cheesy and hard to believe.In spite of the many of its flaws, the film does have its moments and it manages to touch your heart on more than one occasion. For instance, the Diwali phone conversation between the couple; there is nothing to eat in the fridge and Raj pretends to be eating, yet his wife understands that he is lying. The scene is moving (although it is, again, hard to believe that a common family's fridge would be completely empty). I loved the scene in which Hema asks her son how he can be moved by his wife's tears but doesn't give a damn for his mother's tears. Hema Malini was spectacular in both of these scenes. What I particularly liked, however, is the nice interaction between Raj and the new people he meets in a nearby restaurant in which he spends most of his time, including its young clients and particularly its owners, a childless couple played by Paresh Rawal and Lillete Dubey.Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini, who have worked together many times, totally rise above the script and bring so much experience, sensitivity and depth to their respective roles that the otherwise poorly-handled portrayal of their love becomes convincing. Paresh Rawal and Lillete Dubey play their roles to perfection and make for an extremely sympathetic couple. Salman and Mahima are wasted, and all the four sons, their wives and children, are strictly average. The film belongs to the main lead and it's nice to see an out-and-out commercial Hindi movie in which the lead pair are 60 years old.Baghban works in parts. Sometimes it's exciting, but sometimes it's boring and unwatchable. It generally works as typical Bollywood entertainment. The story had been tackled in Bollywood too many times before in films like Avtaar. Yet there is something very refreshing and new about the way it's presented in a modern-day India, even if it's not completely convincing. The irony conveyed through this film is too evident: strangers treat them better than their own children. I guess this was made to shock the audience and convey a striking message. The music is average, but the fact that Bachchan performs his own songs is good for the film. The ending is dramatic, overdone, but still somehow works on you. Maybe it's the best thing about this film; the moral taught in it and the good acting are stronger than any of its weaknesses." 
" brilliant","Being one of the first Indian movies I have ever watched, I didn't know what to expect.I have to admit I was enchanted and awed beyond my expectation by the way the brilliant storyline, the excellent acting by Amitabh, Hema and the others, plus the superb editing and production combined, to create the most near perfect film that not only Indian families can relate to but every family from every culture, race and nation, which is excellent in itself.I cried like a baby! Indian movies have a new big fan in me because of this excellent production, Baghban.The main focus of the story line centred around an elderly couple and the manner in which situations faced by elderly people nowadays and experienced everywhere in the world were presented touched me deeply. Great piece of work!" 
" Melodramatic but a superb climax by Amitabh","Okay, the movie has a good theme--people should not forget their parents and discard them when they get old.  However, I don't see some of the things happening in real life, especially things like Amitabh's glasses not being repaired.  Sometimes the anger was also justified such as the late-night typewriter incident and the daughter coming back home at 3 AM (since they didn't know the true story).  Somethings were just over-doing it, such as Salman and Mahima literally worshiping Salman's parents.  The ever-growing love between Amitabh and Hema was really sweet.  It was nice to see elderly, true love after watching cliched perfect 20s romance in every movie.  What I especially didn't like about this movie is that it put women back in the 19th century where they are supposed to sit on the edge of their chair every evening, waiting for their husband to open the door; they should live in the kitchen.  Hema's dialogue, "Times may change, but a woman's role never changes" ticked me off.  However, this whole movie was made up by the climax, which was one extraordinary speech by Amitabh.  His perfect eloquence is unmatchable by any other orator in Indian cinema.  His words envelope you and take you on an emotional roller coaster." 
" A movie that depicts real life REALLY!!!","First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to agree with jungleking.  He has told it like it is.I'll admit there are a few movies that will make me ball out and this is one of them.  This is movie is reality in its true colours.Great performances by the whole cast and great work by the crew.I believe that Baghban should be made into a book, but that is my view.If you haven't seen Baghban, watch it as soon as possible.  It is worth the time." 
" very emotional movie","this movie is very emotional....children should learn to give love for their parents and not separate them."Parents are not the ladders to children to grow up but are roots of children's success" these are small things which often neglected ...in the movie the children separate the parents and at the age where they need love they are denied...righteously they deserve the punishment...Amitabh and Hema Malini excelled in their respective roles and emotions shown by them were able to bring tears in my eyes, especially when they are separated.Baghban, should be shown to every child to let them know the value of parents." 
" Excellent movie!","What a great movie! I don't have to tell you that. Yes, the movie is somehow a little bit overdone, but the story is very new and refreshing. Two parents who have brought up 5 sons and at the end they only can depend on one, an adopted son.I didn't like all of the sons as actors. The four men who came directly out of soap series, don't have it in them to play in a big Bollywood movie. They don't act confident although they try very hard. Even Salman Khan acted badly at the end of his speech for his father. What was he doing? Crying or something? I like him more in movies where he plays a mental patient like in Tere naam or Kyon ki? Not because I think Salman is a retard, but he is very great in such roles. The little boy who played the grandson was ridiculous to see. I have seen much better young actors of his age.The whole movie was built on a big fundament called all together Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, Paresh Rawal, Lillette Dubey and of course Sharat Saxena! Great songs, and well done dancing.The end of Amitabh's speech where he thanks his wife is stolen directly from the movie A beautiful mind. A pity, but still Amitabh can make such a boring speech so interesting. Talking about boring, maybe one of the reporters in the movie has been sleeping when he asked: "If it would have been your own experience, what would you have done?" If he had listened to the speech he would have known that Baghban really was his life story." 
" A Film Based on Truth","Last week I watched BAGHBAN and I found film based on truth. Sir Amitabh with his legendary performances has once again proved that he is the star of all the times and the legend of the new millenium. What should I say about Madam Hema Mailini, she really knows the magic how to grasp time in her hand and as time has passed she has really become more beautiful. Madam Hema Malini's performances were also fabulous. And about Salman Khan, this is the first film where I have liked his performances." 
" This movie shows the absolute farce which is Indian Society","This movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What it tries to show you is only ONE side of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children which this movie does not show."Indian Parents" are culpable for the following: a. Destroying the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age. Such children grow up to be Adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds. Since everything has been provided to them by their great Indian parents, They children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parents.B. I can show you so many Indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends, going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adults.The reason why they do is the same selfishness. Indian parents "expect" their children to take care of them when they grow old. They do no savings for themselves and once they reach the age of 50...They cry out LOUD......We have grown old now and so we are dependent on you children since we have done the GREAT SERVICE of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weak.Most of the Indian parents at the age of 50 have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure. Most feel that they ABSOLUTELY have no need to take care of themselves since they "expect" their kids to take care of them.In the west the opposite of that happens. People start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they retire they are financially secure.Indian parents do NOTHING of that sort since like I said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at that?.I am a victim of my Indian parents (i am sure there are countless other Indian kids like me), who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on THEIR OWN and they continue to have pestering 50 year olds who cry out loud for HELP all the time.This movie shows only ONE side of the story.....UTTER piece of JUNK" 
" so sappy it should come with a Surgeon General's warning","Watching "Baghban" is the movie equivalent of trying to eat one's way out of a vat of saltwater taffy for nigh unto three hours. This Indian film is a sticky sweet, sentimental soap opera that starts off like "King Lear," moves on to "Romeo and Juliet" in the middle section, then heads back again to "King Lear" for its tear-soaked finale.Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man could possibly want out of life: a wife who adores him, a family who loves him, and a job from which he is about to retire after a lifetime of faithful service. Even though Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four grown sons, they still act like a couple of love struck newlyweds, cooing and sighing, batting their eyes at one another and whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears almost to the point of nausea. In fact, the whole bloody brood is so happy, loving and harmonious that they make the Von Trapps look like a dysfunctional family in comparison. The parents and children joke together, laugh together, even perform elaborately choreographed, "spontaneous" song-and-dance numbers together (like many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" is a drama interspersed with a great number - in this case, far too great a number - of musical sequences).Anyone who knows anything at all about storytelling is aware that such unadulterated bliss can not be allowed to go unpunished for long, and that all that joy is merely the prelude to some awful catastrophe destined to come crashing down on the heads of our unsuspecting revelers. Knowing this, we spend the first hour of the film in fearful expectation, wondering just what form that disaster will take when it does finally arrive. The thunderclap occurs about an hour into the film, when Raj announces to his children that he and their mother have decided to move in with one of their families, leaving the choice of which one it will be up to the kids and their respective spouses. Suddenly, like King Lear discovering the vipers hidden in the familial bosom, Raj finds out that his children are not quite as loving, selfless and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought. Understandably horrified at the prospect, the kids, in order to foil their parents' plan, come up with a scheme in which Raj will go live with one of their children, while Pooja will live with another; then they will switch off until, eventually, each of the children has had a chance to host both parents and then the cycle will repeat itself ad infinitum. Much to the chagrin of the kids, the parents accede to the plan, even though the two are deeply in love with one another and have never spent any time apart. Thus, the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two aging (albeit married) lovers pining away for one another, while their ungrateful, insensitive little brats do everything in their power to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are in their homes.One of the major problems with "Baghban" is that it lacks subtlety in both its storytelling and direction. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for one another, as well as the almost giddy closeness of the family unit, is laid on so thickly in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of the sentimentality. Then, virtually without any warning, the screenplay turns on a dime and converts the kids into callous, self-centered monsters and the parents into passive, whiny victims of that callousness. Raj and Pooja are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self-reliant to be doing the dreamy-eyed, pouting, unrequited love bit, more appropriate to lovelorn school kids than the parents of four grown children. The purple prose style, in which every emotion is underlined and highlighted, leads to intense overacting and a heavy reliance on corny reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation. The musical numbers convey a certain liberating joy in the beginning, but they go on for so long and turn up so frequently that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to pad out the material to unendurable proportions. At least a full hour could be excised from this bloated production with no discernible harm being done - and quite a bit of good. There really is no reason why this film needs to drag on for a punishing three hours. Most egregious of all is the seemingly endless harangue we are subjected to an the end, a speech in which Raj (who has somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award-winning bestseller) lectures us all on the verities of parent/child relationships for ten straight minutes at the very least."Baghban" is a sappy, corny saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a king-sized box of See's chocolates. Sample at your own risk."

" Previous versions of this story","There have been several movies with the exact same theme, some of which I enumerate belowSchool Master (1958) - a masterpiece in Kannada by B.R.Panthulu School Master (1959) - remade by Panthulu himself in Hindi Zindagi (1976) - Starring Sanjeev Kumar and Mala SinhaI believe there is at least one version each in Telugu (late 50s or 60s), Tamil (60s) and Malayalam (70s?).It would be a worthwhile exercise to see the changing social context depending on when this story has been filmed. IMO, the 1958 version is a must-see." 
" Very Partial","Two days ago I got a chance to watch this movie on Cable (TV-Asia). I have been very disturbed since then. The movie "Baghban" has been very successful in portraying only one side of the real life. It is highly partial towards parents. Have you ever thought of other side (kids)?? There are few parents in this world who just give birth to their kids but don't give right parental care. I am a victim of that. Why do you (parents) want to have 5 kids in your life if you are merely making only Rs 2000 per month? I was made to work on streets along with my siblings. I have no idea how I managed to reach IIT from there. It has been a long time since then but still I don't believe. Now I am a research scientist here in USA. I have provided all the necessities to my parents along with care by my two brothers who stay along with them. They could not provide basic things to us when we were kids. I find this movie very resentful. Its very partial. It has hurt my sentiments very deeply. I strongly urge the producer/director of this movie to look at the Indian society in other point of view also and make another movie. I can be reached at john_simension@yahoo.com" 
" Normal family life","A heart touching movie. A true story for some families. Seriously fantastic but copied! It made my grandpa cry. Everyone's got to see it and understand a life which lasts for no one. It is so true and famous around India And Pakistan mow! Most of the Pakistani's say that it is a copied story of an old Pakistani movie called 'Gharana'. Surely it is tear jerking. It makes most of the people cry and satisfied in the end. It deserves a great reward. Don't miss it! YOU are going to LOVE it! Keep tissue boxes beside you when you watch this movie. You are seriously going to spread the whole movie to everyone as you are going to like it that much. Hope you enjoy it. It is Remarkable!!!"
