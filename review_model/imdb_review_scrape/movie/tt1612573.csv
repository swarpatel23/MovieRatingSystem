" Simple,horror and modification of Grudge.","Well,when i saw this movie it remind's me of Grudge movie at many scenes and it is only the modification of Grudge with some songs and some changes.This is a simple and short horror flick showing how married couple is under the curse of spirit in the house.Don't expect too much from it,because these are the kind of movies which satisfy you only once and after that you will lose interest in them.I will really praise the Acting of Tanushree Dutta,how she is fighting with the curse and increasing the viewer's interest in it.Udita was not too bad but yet we can't ignore other's role.Go and watch,but at night so that it will scare you more.Thanx" 
" Simple story nothing less nothing more","I watched it yesterday night and must say it was worth to watch for at least one time.It is such a kind of movie which you enjoy while watching and then forget it.Simple story of haunted house portrayed nicely with some good performances from lead roles. If you like some haunted movies then this is a good choice for Saturday night but don't expect some quality horror. Tanushree duta looking good in lead role graphically this movie lacks professionalism and most of scenes inspired from grudge series which makes it some kind of ordinary tale. Story involves young couple came to new house on their wedding anniversary and some ghost game starts with them. In short it is a simple story of a haunted house which is good for Saturday night." 
" Could Have Been Better","This film could have been better, definitely could have done with a tighter budget which would have made up for the special effects and produced better scares. The CGI was really poor, the stunts were horrible (visible strings and what not) and most of the stages which were supposed pass as real life places looked painfully obvious that all was not what it seemed because of the really small budget for such a supernatural flick that relies on technology for 90% of its scares. Other than that it was a fair thriller. It is nice to see that Tanushree Dutta despite all her recent real life scandals and temporary blacklist is still getting work in Bollywood."
