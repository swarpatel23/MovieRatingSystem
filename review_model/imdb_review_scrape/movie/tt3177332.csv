" A good Movie with a bad ending","A very good effort by Ayush Raina , he gave a good thriller and horror experience and he managed to maintain it throughout the movie.First half was really terrific ,the impact of the first half creates huge expectation in the second half but its there the movie some what failed to meet the expectation . The background music is too high in the second half and its some what irritating and avoids the thrill effect in many scenes ,the climax failed to maintain the horror and the movie failed to be a complete horror movie at the end . The climax is in a simple Indian movie style which destroys the ramp created throughout the movie . The movie is completely in a Hollywood style with a Indian masala climax.on the whole its a very good horror movie with a simple ending." 
" Spooky and Horror","Movie is amazing and quite fearful.It is good Bollywood film and not like other horror films of Bollywood which are somewhat funny but not fearful.The star cast of the movie is new and acting by them is good.This movie doesn't have any songs and the story of the movie is average . The lighting and sound effects are good.Pros of the movie are it is quite fearful.The movie is short and it doesn't contain any unwanted scenes.Few scenes in the movie is good,can surely send shivers down your spine.Cons of the movie are dialogues of the movie and few are unnecessary and last 5-10 minutes of the movie is a little silly.Overall the movie is good and quite spooky and fearful." 
" Welcome to The Grandiose... The hotel lived up to the name, the movie itself didn't...","Director Ayush Raina tried a little bit too hard and failed in the attempt. For a horror movie then "Horror Story" was surprisingly shallow and devoid of anything particularly scary.The story is about seven young people who hear the story of a business man who committed suicide at a reportedly haunted hotel by the name of The Grandiose. Being as carefree as young people are they decide to go to the hotel as a farewell to the departed. As they set foot inside the hotel, it quickly becomes clear that something is most definitely not right at the hotel, and there is something dark and evil roaming the long abandoned corridors.I will say that the hotel itself was really nicely detailed, and had lots of interesting things to be seen, and the atmosphere was indeed one of the best aspects of the entire movie.The dialogue in the movie was horribly scripted, and many times you sit there and think 'did they really just say that?' Most of the time the dialogue doesn't have a particularly natural flow to it and comes off as forced and artificial.As for the acting, well, let's just say that some of the people were doing good enough jobs, while others had a tendency to over do it and put on a very theatrical act that was just uncalled for and just turned out to be too much.The camera-work in "Horror Story" was actually quite good, and made the movie all the more enjoyable and watchable.Oh, and before I forget, then I will also give praise to the music and sound score in the movie, because it was quite good. Lots of great atmospheric music here and great usage of sound effects.For a horror movie, then "Horror Story" was frightfully devoid of anything particularly scary. Or perhaps I have just been watching too many horror movies, because I didn't find this movie the least bit scary or terrifying.There are far better non-Western horror movies out there, especially from Japan, Korea and Thailand, which might be a better bet if you are looking for a good scare." 
" The Horror (?)","Well if you have not been drinking the cool aid or have not watched more than 3 horror movies or have just a low bar when it comes to "entertainment" than you might rate this higher than I have. Good for you, but generally speaking and lets keep it real here: this is not good by any standard. Maybe the cinematography, but that's about it.The acting is weak, the script is weak, there are no big effects here. And while the characters are not teenagers, they act as if they were (brainless) but even worse: their charisma level is below zero. And likeable is also different. Of course you can take a couple of things in consideration, like this being apparently the directorial debut and so forth. But that is up to you. I'm not judging the director based on one movie, this end product however is very uninspired ..." 
" Amateurish attempt at horror","From all the pre-release hype surrounding this movie, I was expecting a good quality horror flick but was disappointed in about 15 minutes in to the movie. The movie reeks of amateurishness throughout. The direction, acting, cinematography were all sub standard. I see some reviewers have commented this to be the best Indian Horror film. This cannot get any further from the truth.1920 was far superior in every department. Even Bhoot and Haunted were better than this time waster. I cannot fathom how Vikram Bhatt got in to making this movie after having set a certain standard with 1920.Horror is not about loud background sounds, or shrieking (over acting) youngsters; this movie is replete with these. There is not one moment that I can call suspenseful or scary.The can rolling back, the radio playing without batteries -- come on! Get original.The set, a supposedly decrepit hotel, is not scary at all. It looks designed in very room and corner and does not evoke the feeling of being in a dilapidated building. The walls in all the rooms have the same look - someone rubbed their hands in charcoal and went streaking the walls with soot to make them look old.Poor casting, acting, cinematography, story, dialogs and direction. The worst was the set. I would recommend you see this movie to appreciate some of the other Indian horror movies better." 
" Then what if it is copied,Horror Story is a good one time watch","Bollywood movies are these days badly criticized for borrowing some elements or even whole concept from Hollywood flicks.Horror story too was panned as some referred it as direct copy of grave encounters and had some scenes similar to two or three other English movies..I have also seen Grave encounters and yes the plot was quite similar..OK lets assume that the critics haven't seen any of the above English movies..I am sure then they must have reviewed the horror story positively..So why not put ourselves in that category of those who are more on bollywood side and watch foreign movies less often..Bollywood wants to present Hollywood flicks for our typical Indian spectators in our own style..Why not think that way rather than to criticize almost every Indian horror movie..Just forget that you have seen grave encounters or any of other English horror and watch The Horror Story..I assure you that you won't be disappointed..There are some flaws but as per horror quotient is considered it will surely terrify you..I rate it 7 out of 10..A must one time watch for all supernatural horror movie fans" 
" Just another inspired scary flick from Vikram Bhatt's factory.","The name Vikram Bhatt, has been associated with many scary movies in the recent past and the man has been regularly coming up with films made in this particular genre quite confidently. Now though one might have an idea that most of these films were not successful at the box office visibly. But considering the fact that he has been repeatedly doing the same, it seems that the costs are being recovered easily and maybe some profits are being earned too in the long run. So following this hidden safe pattern, HORROR STORY is another of his routine spooky movies as a writer-producer, directed by Ayush Raina featuring all new faces in the cast, playing the victims. In simple words, the film gives you nothing to explain in details since it's one of those regular (weak) inspired movies only, taking their major ingredients from the west and nothing else. This time Vikram and his director take their basic inspiration from GRAVE ENCOUNTERS series (2011 & 2012) which revolves around a reality show crew getting locked in a haunted mental asylum, abandoned from years. Perhaps the sight of a 'not in use' famous hotel in Mumbai, gave the makers this idea of adapting the western horror movie, but in any case this is probably the best way a deserted hotel building can be exploited, smartly beneficial for both the parties involved, financially.The story begins with a suicide committed at the venue and then seven students decide to enter the haunted building as their new night adventure. The references of the building being an old mental asylum, before getting transformed into a lavish hotel reminds you of the English film right away and then several sequences strengthen the fact further. However the writers interestingly add the typical Indian flavour to its storyline towards the end, similar to many already seen horror movies from the famous 'Ramsay' era of the last millennium. As it progresses further, a big merit of the film is that it thankfully doesn't venture into any romance, love affairs or songs and straight goes into the scary mode within the first 10 minutes itself. Though once again the impact is more because of the sounds than the visuals, yet it does manage to give you that creepy feeling at times but not in any regular or high dosages till the end. Hence for the die-hard fans of the genre, this would turn out to be an experimental kind of below average fare offering nothing beyond what they have already seen before. But for just the fun, it might appeal to the few, who are quite new to the world of horror films.Talking about the commercial viability of the project, it has been planned very intelligently keeping the minimum cost factor in mind, wherein the location is a deserted one, all debutants are playing the lead roles (who play it fine) and the duration of the film is only about 90 minutes without any songs or unwanted steamy scenes. So considering it from that angle this is in fact 'A Clean Horror Movie' from the house of Vikram Bhatt unexpectedly.However, from the consumer viewpoint, I would like to express that if the makers are ready to give us such experimental kind of movies made in a smart, cost effective manner like HORROR STORY then kindly plan the ticket rates also into some lower amount slabs to make it equal. Otherwise it cannot be called a balanced venture at all, wherein the makers are making it as a low budget project to be on the safer side, but the viewers are still paying the usual amount of Rs.200+ for the same, like fools. Hopefully the point reaches the people who can think upon it in the coming months for our mutual benefits." 
" Terror cum panic","Firstly i am not good at writing reviews so apology for any mistakes.Coming to the movie it is another fine horror flick by vikram bhatt joins one among the bollywood's best horror movies ever.The story revolves 7 friends on their reunion decide to go to a locked down hotel Grandios when they hear about that hotel owner had committed suicide following dreadful deaths have been caused in the hotel room number 2046 due to paranormal acitivity.Least they know that hotel was built upon the mental asylum which was burned down due to short circuit. will they able to survive against the onslaught of evil??? The movie contains some scary moments accompanied by high quality stereo effects which will make your heart quiver by fear.Good acting by the star cast and less story leading to shortened run time around 1hr 30min unlike most of the Bolly horror flicks.only one con in the film is last 2 to 3 scenes which could be done better.overall its a must watch movie don't miss it..Go with your mates and raid the late night shows..." 
" An expected failure","Low-budget horror movies generally have a decent number of scares in offer but also having a Plan B in the form of sex fillers and hot women to keep the audience hooked in case the main premise fails to hold. Sadly, this C-grade horror flick disappoints on both counts. It picks up a much beaten 'abandoned mental hospital' plot and messes it up in all possible ways. Fubar. With irritatingly loud and inexperienced new actors, a poorly written script, goofy scenes that manage to produce laughs instead of chills, average but uninspiring photography, many continuity faults between sequences, and not the least of all, a deafening soundtrack that swallows actors' lines with aplomb, this movie has nothing going for it. Even though end credits say there was a director on board, he/she obviously slept through the project. Given a largely unknown cast & crew, I guess a slipshod effort was to be expected, but I complain because with just a little extra work, viewers could've received decent 90 minutes of entertainment. I caught this movie on Netflix and it's a relief that I did not have to spend my money on seeing it in a theater.VERDICT: This movie is a C-grade effort that intends to rob you of many precious moments of your life. Don't let it. Avoid.ALTERNATE VIEW: Session 9 (the best I've seen on abandoned mental hospital plot) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0261983/" 
" Major fail","Just don't see this. I can act better. I can direct better. JUST A FAIL" 
" not bad for an Indian Horror genre..","1 point for absense of item songs or romantic songs which clealry had no reqiurement in this movie. 1 point for really strong and well presented 1st half of the movie where there are some well scripted spooky moments. 1 point for acting of Karan Kundra. 1 point for being apart from other indian horror movies by keeping the background score low at first half. now where it loses major points are its lack of story n the ending of the movie where it looks like as if they just wanted to wrap it up qiuckly. Plus the part whrre the ghost is wrestling with the main characters just blows the movie at the end in shreds..Could have been better though if it didnt have high background music at the second half." 
" For Bollywoodlovers = recommendation","Some scary moments. No Revolution. Just same plot as horror movies back in the 90th. Teenagers, hotel, ghosts, some weird happenings and very hammy acting. Sometimes the epic music don't fit to the scenes.The most time of the movie I was trying to figure out which language they are currently speaking." 
" I didn't expect so much from this... Really a must watch movie (if u love horror movies)","As a Hindi horror movie, I never expect that much things...really. I must say this movie can straighten up hair if watch it alone. Amazing camera effects, good sound design, the environment, cast and the make up is just brilliant. But the only thing that I must say is the story is little weak as compared to a ordinary Hollywood horror movie :) Director just stretched the story like a bubble gum... Anyways if u wanna freak out, watch this, otherwise don't go to find a story line inside this... As a Hindi horror movie, I never expect that much things...really.

" Finally India got a real horror flick","I have watched this movie just now and I have to say I am quite impressed with it's premises and direction. I do not want to write about star caste as all are newcomers and this movie has nothing to do with star caste in fact. I loved the grip, pace, and direction with sound effects and there are quite shocking scenes and moments.I know this movie must be copied from some Hollywood flick but who cares? I have not seen the original and I watch a lot of foreign horror movies so I can say yes this is India's good show.This movie is much better than any other previous horror flicks of India and I recommend this to watch.8/10" 
" Descent time pass","If yo have nothing to do and want to get moderately entertained and scared then definitely Horror Story will be a good shout. The movie builds up fairly well and gives you enough spooky moments. However, the movie lacks enough substance to make it a good film.The ending however is the worst part of the movie. The end of the movie is what pulls it down and makes it a waste of time. The typical bollywood impossible ending is just too stupid.Its sad that the movie builds up so well to disappoint the audience at the end. Probably that the signature style of Mukesh Bhatt.In summary it is not bad as some of its counter parts. So enjoy the movie only when it is telecast ed on the TV and do not spend your money by going to the theatres." 
" No redeeming features","Acting. Direction. Sound design. Story. Script. Every element of this diabolical production is so bad it feels like it has to be a joke. But no. It's just dreadful. Why are there constant animal noises? This is a message for the 'director' of this thing. Please, for the love of God, do not make any more movies. You just can't do it. You have no talent. I wish someone had had the honesty to tell you before, but it had to be me."
