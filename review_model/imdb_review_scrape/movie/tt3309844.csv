" Quite funny but with too much music","I saw Baahubali last night which was far too violent. After that, I surfed the TV movie channels for something light hearted to end the day with.Chanced upon Titoo MBA :) :) Never heard of this movie before but the dialogues seemed funny so decided to give it a go.This is a fun movie, very Punjabi, set in a typical Punjabi small town with typical middle class Punjabi families living in typical old style Punjab houses. However living not so typical small town lives. Or are they?Watch Titoo to find out.Some of the dialogues are hilarious though some could have had better timing. There was far too much music in the movie. Perhaps the makers felt the music would be the draw but actually the plot and the funny dialogues could hold their own. The best was the final punch line. Absolutely hilarious. Do see it for yourself." 
" Coming age, one of the most underrated, yet funny and touching.","I don't understand why it's such a low rated movie. Also, I haven't heard anyone knowing it's even a movie. Go watch it guys! It's quite entertaining, funny and touching. Oh man, the lead Titoo, his acting was a top notch. He was so good in his role he never missed out at any scene. I can feel for the roles of the top two. I was disappointed with the climax. They should have given more stuff in it. Ended up too soon. Makes me remember 2 States, the way that movie started, the difference was there was someone else than the psychiatrist."
