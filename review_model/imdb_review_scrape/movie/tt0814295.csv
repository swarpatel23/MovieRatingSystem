" It's Okay.....","Rocky: The Rebel is about a young man named Rocky (played my Zayed Khan). Rocky has anger problems, or as he thinks of it; he's a courageous fellow who helps people in need rather than just ignoring them. His father doesn't approve of his antics, but his mom has always supported him because she believes in him.One day, Rocky decided to open up a Cyber Cafe. It goes wrong when a couple of goons start harassing a girl, Neha. Neha runs for help to Rocky's friend. He can't do anything, so he calls Rocky. Rocky realizes what happens and beats up the goons. Later him and Neha fell in love and got engaged.But what Rocky is about to realize is that maybe helping Neha by beating up the goons, was his biggest mistake. Everything goes haywire, his parents ignore him, even his mom is realizing that Rocky is nothing but a troubled child. Now what happens to Rocky?" 
" An Average goodie","I just saw this movie and i don't think it is that bad! it only got 2 stars in the newspapers but i think it deserves at least a 3. it has a good story but the actors have to improve a little bit of their acting have to improve a little bit upon his acting! but the movie was a okay overall and it is a okay film with a few comedy scenes..... rajat bedi{Anthony} was also good in his negative role and also there were good action scenes but the main drawback are the songs of this film............... i only liked "junoon junoon" rest were just like that....... but overall this film can be considered as a One time see....and also we expect a better acting from zayed next time!!Also the bollywood should gain inspirations from the newcomers on the screen..............."
