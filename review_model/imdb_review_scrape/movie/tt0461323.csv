" Funny film","Seems like these days everyone in Bollywood has a disability (mute-Teesri Aankh; deaf/blind/mute-Black; blind-Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai; mute/deaf/blind-Tom, Dick, and Harry) and now deaf/blind with Pyare Mohan. Thank goodness, though, that this time it's a comedy! Vivek Oberoi is deaf, and Fardeen Khan plays blind. Being a comedy, their acting is not meant to be realistic at all, but just funny, which it definitely is! Vivek and Fardeen's scenes are absolutely hilarious. I'd say this is one of the best comedies of 2006. Boman Irani's acting is as always impeccable. It doesn't matter that the story is very predictable--the comedy keeps you going! However, the climax just stretches it too far and doesn't go along with the rest of the film. Nonetheless, Pyare Mohan is enjoyable. Vivek gives a great performance after a long time (since Saathiya), and Fardeen is good too. Esha is good and looks great. Amrita's decent. Songs are not too bad. All in all, Pyare Mohan's a light-hearted, be it a bit over-the top, fun-filled comedy!" 
" A really funny movie","Many moments in the first-half between the deaf hero (Oberoi) and the blind hero (Khan) have a warmth of shared camaraderie especially when they share their girlfriend woes or try to see the lighter side of their handicaps.But then you've seen Ralph Fiennes play a blind man in "The White Countess" at the same time as Fardeen's blind act. And you wonder how long we must continue to bear the atmosphere of mediocrity that prevails in a particular style of mainstream Hindi cinema. However, keep in mind that this is Bollywood and not a Hollywood flick.To his credit, Indra Kumar tries to be stylish in the songs. The songs are good. Especially, "Rabba de de Jawani" The dialogues are occasionally crisp. Most of the deaf hero's mis-read lip movements are funny. The actors did their bit to enhance the mood of satire.The noisy 'cool' song sequences have been done to a cliché. Except the fact that the film makes a pitch for the handicapped to have a normal even fun-filled life, "Pyare Mohan" has nothing to offer that would qualify as novel or engaging. How many movies will make such a statement.The second half is completely botched with the near mid-air crash experience of passengers reaching a nadir of mediocrity in film-making.Indra Kumar goes for a toned-down funny beginning that finally ends with the characters running helter-skelter in Bangkok - a beautiful city, here reduced to looking like the crowded traffic-choked highways of Mumbai.The search for the two lady loves (Esha Deol and Amrita Rao) in the hustle bustle of Bangkok is done in a revved-up hysterical slapstick style that Indra Kumar patented decades ago.The climax with villain Boman Irani hurling empty bottles at the two heroines is straight out of a Chinese Kung Fu movie.A queer mix of the mirthful and the monstrous, "Pyare Mohan" has many moments that keep us smiling and laughing." 
" Bad, yet enjoyable!","I watched this expecting a stupid, pointless, crappy movie, but I was quite surprised. It was a typical Bollywood movie in the end, with the guys getting the girls, but it was, I admit, quite funny! The acting was done averagely, it was the comic timing that was the secret. And each cast member does a great job in that department, the comic timing and humour is really good, and the music is also acceptable. Its very entertaining, good for time-pass and a nice laugh!Pyare Mohan is the typical sob-story Hindi film, with all the drama and romance, but it has been told in immense style.Well done." 
" See no Evil - Hear no evil","Dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The movie followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti all of whom were superb.But then every successful director gives a few horrible movies alongwith some hits too. Pyare Mohan is one such movie.Though the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh. Comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a dumb.If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please don't watch this. Because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only.In short, the movie is worth a miss." 
" Pathetic. Awful. Hopeless","Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind. The film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of Black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the film if possible." 
" Pyare Mohan","An inseparable duo  blind Pyare and deaf Mohan they rely on each other totally and combat the hilarious, often poignant situations they find themselves in, to the best of their abilities or rather disabilities! The only thing missing in their lives is LOVE till they meet Preeti and Priya, as they fight to win their love, they find themselves fighting for their lives. Pyare and Mohan do win their love,although Preeti and Priya only like them as a friend because of there disabilities.Then in an airplane,everyone thinks they are going to crash. They over hear a conversation between the priest and Don Tony head leader of the under world,about him murdering others.Even as they teach us in a rip roaring way that what you need in love is not eyes and ears  but a heart." 
" Awful","After the reasonably successful MASTI which was tad better Inder Kumar returned again with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood film SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL The film reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE(1994) where Kader and Anupam play the blind and deafThis movie is a tedious exerciseThe film has jokes of such nonsense that you don't feel like laughing like Snehal Dabi's head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we don't laugh at now but mock The film starts off in a clichéd manner and some scenes are funny sadly such moments don't last long as the story never moves in this half even the comedy gets boring The twist is well handled and the second half becomes an action film where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all OTT chase scenes and fight scenesDirection by Inder Kumar is bad Music is okay, one song stands out I LOVE YOU MY ANGELVivek is awful in the comic scenes, his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes For some reason he keeps doing comedy and ruined his career Fardeen Khan is tad better but too wooden Amongst the rest Esha and Amrita are the heroines Boman Irani annoys here Snehal Dabbi is okay" 
" what you waiting for? go get it! wicked film","absolutely wicked movie, i rented it from the video shop but didn't have enough time to watch it so i made a back up of it the excitement is beyond speech and the movie is just wah bhai wah if u got the chance then watch it right now, otherwise you are going to miss out on a huge action/comedy/emotional flick the beginning is a comedy caper and tends to make u laugh your head off but, the emotions tend to make you stop and think. although it is about love, it doesn't put u off and makes u think it of as another old Indian movie i don't know y i didn't watch it before but, now i feel like watching it again and again and oh yeah dis is going in my top 100."
