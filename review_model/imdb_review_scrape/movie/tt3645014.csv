" Not even worth giving a review on","I know the movie doesn't deserve one star out of 10. But that is the least I can give. 'Awful', the only word that can describe this movie. I don't know what glamour was the director trying to pull off. The movie was just an instrument for Himesh Reshamiyya to propound his songs. Yeah, and the songs too! I don't know why people loved the songs. They were just remakes of the previous super hit songs. I should have watched the election results today which were undoubtedly much more interesting than this crap movie. But my friends dragged me to watch it. And now they are regretting too. Speaking of acting, actor is good at his place and singer is best at his place. Himesh should never think of becoming an actor. He is not at all a star material." 
" Good work! Thumbs up!","Some films come with big hype, months of promotions, and after watching the film the audience might feel 'was it worth the hype?'. Then there are some films which are decently promoted and well made, but straightaway rejected by the audience even without watching it! And at a later point of time when they get a chance to watch the movie, they may say 'arre, yeh film toh theek tha (hey, this film was alright!). The Xpose, unfortunately falls to the second category.My friends laughed at me when I told them that I am gonna watch a Himesh Reshammiya flick, that too in theater! Well, this is not the first time they laugh at me, I have faced it before also. As a movie lover, I support people who work hard, and put in their efforts to make the best. This guy has worked real hard and shredded approx. 20kgs for this film, and he looks good! Also, the music seems nice, the film is rumored to be based on the dirty games in Bollywood during late 60s, and the director is a National Award winning man! I think these are enough reasons to watch this movie.The film, promoted as a murder mystery, rather is more of a drama than a thriller. Yes, there are a few thrills but eventually it falls into the drama genre. It has its well-developed characters, the emotions and the dirty tricks human minds play to keep themselves safe. As mentioned earlier, the film is set in late 1960s and is all about the glamorous and larger-than life era. An era which showcased the other side of Indian women, who were otherwise portrayed as the usual traditional family girls. As the film unfolds, we are introduced to a world where actresses fight, heroes travel in Impalas, and speak daring one-liners frequently. Love at first sight happens, and hatred too, very often! The film is shot well, despite of its tight budget, and the songs are placed at the right place. The direction is good and he ensures that the audience who comes out the hall are not disappointed. The mystery-revealing portions were, however kinda loose and appeared to be wrapped up very quickly. Had the writers added 10-15 more minutes of investigation stuff to the film, it would have become one of the finest thrillers Bollywood has ever produced! Nevertheless, the film is good and has its moments.But then, its a Himesh Reshammiya movie na, who will watch it in theater! Who can sit through his bad acting? Trust me, once the movie starts reeling, you will be shocked to see an unexpected good performance from him! Yes, he has put his complete effort to live up to the character. His one-liners have an extra-punch! His never-give up attitude ensures that he is here to stay. The débutant Yo Yo Honey Singh has done a decent job, and the rest of the cast enacted their characters convincingly. Special mention to the beautiful and hot lady Sonali Raut. She was awesome. The narration by the talented Irrfan Khan was another plus point.Overall, Xpose is a good watch and an ernest attempt from the makers. Watch it, and explore the dark secrets behind the bollywood of 1960s. Thumbs up for this one!" 
" not even a movie","This is a pathetic movie (if considered a movie at all) with 3 layers of murders of the same person (? I mean really ! :-o). As lead Himesh's (pretending to be Rajinikanth -- feeling meh. Disclaimer: No offense; I am not saying Himesh is worse than Rajinikanth) acting is pathetic; his dialog delivery is so bad that becomes hilarious (!!^&$#@!*&^). Dialogues are over exaggerated, meaningless, and you feel like leaving the theater instantly. All the other actors/actresses and Yo Yo Honey Singh only add patheticity to the entire plot and story; making the whole film unbearable. God help those (including me) who watch this movie. I am still in trauma since I watched the movie." 
" 100 Minutes Of Pure Lack Of Imagination. ♦ 34%","The girl is shown falling off the palace terrace four times throughout the film. Not to strain on how ridiculous is what happens after she falls, I will explain what went wrong with Reshammiya's latest venture cooked up to demean himself.Starting off with an introduction of all the characters, the writer talks about many things at once: 60s' cinema, sex symbols, actresses, parties, competition between actors & directors, etc.. The plot follows the investigation of a girl's murder who falls from a terrace. The funny thing is that there is no detective/police involved in the investigation. I wonder if the viewer is the police here. Finally after talking loads of things about Reshammiya's character and the film fraternity, the story hangs to the night of the incident.Himesh has a wooden face & it is high time he should accept it. Donning smart tux and suits won't help you. He can't act, cannot bring out expressions, I don't understand why he doesn't stick to music. Honey Singh was average. The 2 female débutantes are sex props; all they do is expose, girl-fight, envy and sleep around with male characters or talk about it. The dialogs are hopeless and inappropriate; I found 1 or 2 witty, though. The anachronistic setup is another example of lack of imagination. The whole film is supposed to happen in 1967 Bombay but looks nothing like it.The second half advances to make it look like a whodunit but the unnecessary use of twists just nullifies the work. The climax scene at the court is the most ridiculous setup I have seen in a Bollywood film where a witness uses his eyes to detect the killer. Ah, the folly!The story is so bad and ill-imagined, I start to wonder what all films were sampled to make this piece of extraordinary crass. The music is okay but what was the score of 1980's The Shining doing here! Supporting cast is nothing much to talk about and why would Ananth Mahadevan act in this film is beyond my understanding. But then again, why would he collaborate with Himesh and DIRECT the film for his script is just against the whole race of humanity.BOTTOM LINE: Nothing much to experience here, except maybe the bitching, make-believe Tinseltown and few foreplay sequences. It only shows what we already know.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" Horrible","I sometimes am left amused with our audiences taste, I was shocked that XPOSE is a hit and now plans are up for XPOSE 2. The film is such a torture, It tries to be everything, a thriller, a musical.etc It is set in 1960s when as per our flop director Anant Mahadevan filmmakers only made films on sex and heroes were Angry Young Man(LOL). Ironically the best actors are given the shortest roles,Irrfan Khan and Adil Hussain. The film starts off with a heroine thrown from a terrace(which is repeated many times), then we are introduced to several characters, One being Himesh Reshammiya who reminded me of Dev Anand, being in every frame, doing all the tasks.He starts off being an inspector(with a walk that doesn't suit an inspector), then he shoots a minister in an unintentional hilarious scene, then he becomes a south superstar and finally a Hindi star who shows attitude and dictates things and finally a detective.Then we have Yo Yo Honey Singh playing a singer and other stuff. The way the mystery is solved will make you start loving TV Series CID if you hate it. All looks so stupid and hilarious. Direction by Anant Mahadevan is terrible Music is decent but the songs hardly look like songs of 60s, with stupid lyrics like Ice Cream Khaungi.Himesh Reshammiya lost weight and looks better but still has the same expressionless face in most scenes and an awful dialogue delivery,though he does show some improvement compared to his previous crap works yet he has a long way to go Yo Yo Honey Singh annoys in his debut, his dialogue delivery is horrible and he also gets a raw deal and is left to the backseat at many times Both Sonali Rout and Zoya Afroz are non actors Nakul Vaid is decent in his role, Anant Mahadevan is okay Rajesh Sharma, Dayashankar Pandey do their roles well Adil Hussain and Irrfan Khan are wasted in cameos." 
" A different Himesh Reshammiya, A good movie","Pros: 1) Its Himesh's acting! he was just superb in the movie! the attitude he had shown in the movie is fantastic! I must say HR is growing as an actor from movie to movie, here he is a fully established actor! outstanding performance!2) Another major highlight is the dialogues, Written by Bunty Rathore, I just loved each of them.3)Music: its well known fact that music is massive hit!4)Direction and Screenplay: Ananth Mahadevan has proved once again that he is a fabulous director, loved the way each scene unfolds and how each scene is planned.5)Production value: Its great! with limited budget they had shot such a grand looking movie.Cons: Climax: Yes! in a Who done it kind of movie climax has to be strong,but the way they reveal the murder is not that interesting, you just don't have enough time to think who is murderer, the twist at the end is good, but the way they reveal,could have been better.Special Mention: Yo Yo Honey Singh acted very well too! he has very short roll, but enjoyed watching him, for every scene Honey comes in there will be a huge round of cheers and applause in the hall, this just shows his mammoth fan following. Zoya Afroz and Sonali they are just good! casting is very fine." 
" WHY?Himmesh Reshamiya sucks","I know the movie doesn't deserve one star out of 10. But that is the least I can give. 'Awful', the only word that can describe this movie. I don't know what glamour was the director trying to pull off. The movie was just an instrument for Himesh Reshamiyya to propound his songs. Yeah, and the songs too! I don't know why people loved the songs. They were just remakes of the previous super hit songs.

Speaking of acting, actor is good at his place and singer is best at his place. Himesh should never think of becoming an actor. He is not at all a star material HE SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS" 
" one time watch (risk it)","DISCLAIMER! CONTAINS SPOILER First things first. if you are going to go watch it for pure fun then this movie is alright but if you are going out to get some real action, you'd rather go for something else. 'The Xpose' is set in the 70's time of bollywood where a renowned celebrity dies. This death is first considered a suicide but it is later found out that it is a murder. There are a host of great(rather hilarious) dialogues in the film. the cinematography is quite good but the story is boring. the first half of the film is really really slow(trust me, it was a struggle for survival). the second half wound it up quite alright and was a complement in comparison to the first half. the dialogues were pretty neat but the character of the protagonist was really hard to digest. another thing i wished to tell the readers is that if you are going to watch honey singh act, please do not do so because he was better off rapping. the movie was quite OK but if you are a real movie lover, i suggest you do not go watch it. rating-*" 
" over xposed","The perfect whodunit is one which has you biting your nails in anticipation and trying to figure who the culprit is and all the while trying to spot the red herrings and being fooled by the author (in case of a book) into suspecting the wrong guy or gal. XPOSE looks like it has been written by someone (Himesh Reshmaiya to be precise) who thinks of a premise and then does not know how to end it and like a kindergarten kid with his mouth full of cookies trying putting the blame on some one in the last minute-Like the butler did it.The good thing going for this movie is the 60's campy style and music of the bygone era and the larger than life personalities that stars had which made them believe that they were gods and goddesses.The movie starts with a caption claiming that the incidents shown are based on facts,and this is where we start guessing who's who.The movie focuses on a the rise of two starlets Zara (Sonali Raut) clearly inspired by Zeenath Aman and Chandini (Zoya Afroz), based on Parveen Babi –though neither of them belonged to the 60's. Zara has no qualms of reaching the top, she is prepared to sleep her way to the top and Chandini is miss goody shoes who prefers to remain a virgin and spites quite a few makers.Both the girls land in two controversial films, Zara is offered UJWAL NIRMAL SHEETAL (only a blind man can miss the obvious reference to Satyam Shivam Sundaram) which also marks the Hindi debut of South Super Star Ravi Kumar (Himesh Reshmaiya) a character based on Rajinikanth (again not a 60;s star) but reminds you mostly of Rajkumar and Sunil Dutt. Chandini decides to expose to spite her boyfriend and stars in a movie titled "REENA MERA NAAM" (could be Chetna which starred Rehana Sultana).Both movies release on the same day, UNS flops and RMN becomes a hit, but Zara bags the filmfare award for UNS and she is promptly thrown off a roof of hotel to her death on the same night.Chandini and Zara have a cat fight over Ravi kumar on the same day and Chandini's boyfriend becomes an obvious suspect and is nailed.Ravi Kumar who is obviously in love with Chandini decides to save his beloved's love and unravels the mystery before a dumb judge interrupting the court proceedings.Himesh Reshmaiya is outstanding (I thought I never would be able to say this) as Ravi Kumar, his mannerisms and dialogues are to a T. He pokes fun at himself in a matter of fact way and elevates the thick headed character and half way through the film we can actually see who the character is based on.Zoya Afroz has those innocent bubbly looks of Poonam Dhillion (and her acting skills as well) looks good in the bikini act, and that's where we can stop the praise.The scene stealer is Sonali Raut in her see through Sari and venom spitting performance as Zoya. She plays the bad act well and is the only one with the best lines apart from Himesh Reshmaiya.Yo Yo Honey Singh has very little to do as a Music Director KD (obviously referencing RD Burman), but does have resembling character traits of Kishore Kumar too, He sleepwalks through the film. What the hell was Irrfan Khan doing in this? Don't ask, possibly even he does'nt know the answer.Music by Himesh Reshamaya is good-fitting the 60's like a glove, but the ice cream song seems to have been heavily borrowed from Micheal Jackson's Bad. Overlook that fact and you have a movie with good foot tapping music.Screenplay is tight but fades out towards the end, but Ananth Mahadevan's direction ensures that there is not a single dull moment in the film, though you are disappointed by the way the movie ends, you thank your stars that at least it did not bore you to death.Go for it if you love 60's style foot tappers and have nothing else to do." 
" Xpose: Not that bad! :)","Yes, I did go to watch a Himesh Reshammiya movie for the first time in my life. And the movie fulfilled all I wanted out of it, fultoo fun and jibe moments through over-the-top performances by most actors (Himesh leading the pack all the way!) Also, the movie does surprise with some twists. When you think it's all over, it reveals some more layers over layers. Finding the 'real' killer isn't that easy after all. The plot is Agatha Christi-c, the premises 60's ka Bollywood. Ananth Mahadevan (director) succeeds in presenting this murder-mystery on-screen upto an extent.Its out an out HR movie who reminds you of actor Late Raj Kumar as superstar Ravi Kumar with similar attitude, arrogance, self-obsession (talking of himself in third person). All this exudes oodles of unintended humour. His dhaansu dialogues (some of which make no sense) can send intellectuals to coma but those searching fun will have a gala time. His overcoats and jackets (esp the red one) can't be ignored (ROFL). Characters of Sonali Raut and Zoya Afroz are drawn as parallels to Zeenat Aman and Late Parveen Babi. So beaucoup de skin show (justifying film's title). Honey Singh also doesn't act but even then his mannerisms too invoke smiles! Contrastingly, ace actors like Irrfan, Rajesh Sharma and Adil Hussain do justice with their brief roles. Music (both songs and background) is quite peppy and catchy and some songs are quite melodious. Full marks to Himesh and Yo Yo for the same! In all, this 2-hr movie isn't meant for our grey matter but is still watchable (esp if watched with friends and fun-intent). My rating: **1/2" 
" Brilliant as a spoof","I give this film a 1 as I know HR did not concept this as a spoof film. But the acting, the editing, the dialogue are all so bad that it works as a spoof of a bunch of mostly talentless actors working on a vanity project. A wooden doll emotes better than Himesh. His character is a narcissistic sociopath but hey, it works for the non-multiplex audiences whom the film targets. And he is no Rajnikanth in delivering masala dialogues. I think the film would have worked better if Himesh approached this as a spoof film and played the role over the top, with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge to the audience. Pro tip : Don't pay money to watch the film. You'll get more fun with your cash if you burn it and watch the flames." 
" Far Better than Holly copies which Bollywood are following","Another Experiment By Anant Mahadevan in Bollywood at a time when no movies are releasing due to IPL. This movie was strictly okay and you can watch it if you are not Cricket Fan. Movie is a musical thriller with Himesh in lead who done well than his previous films. Honey Singh was in a Extended Cameo role and many famous actors like Adil Hussain, Irfan Khan, Rajesh Sharma and Nakul Vaid in small roles. Music and songs are good. Movie is though a bit filmy but still give it a chance and last 30 min you will really enjoy the suspense. Though I was a bit disappointed as Honey Singh role was very limited and he was not shown proper screen time to show his acting skills." 
" Not so bad.","Good storyline.
Implementation was bad, horrible dialogue." 
" What a pathetic movie","Only one two songs are good otherwise other things are just pathetic especially dialogues and acting of actors except sonali raut. What a disgusting screenplay and story." 
" Works in Parts...","'The Xpose', a musical-thriller, isn't without merit, but unfortunately, there isn't much of it either. Its works, but only in parts. It has a few absorbing moments & melodious moments working on its side, but an erratic Screenplay, spoils the fun, in totality.'The Xpose' Synopsis: A top actress from the late 1960's is killed & now follows the search to find her murderer. 'The Xpose' takes us back in time, the late 60's, where glamour & ambitious, like decade, was at its peak. So in terms of nostalgia, 'The Xpose' is good-looking. But, the Screenplay is erratic & shaky. The film begins well & the narrative is nicely handled up-to interval. Its the second-hour, that disheartens. The suspense element lacks the fizz & so does the murderer's motives. In short, the film takes off safely, but loses focus later-on.Anant Mahadevan's Direction is strictly okay. Cinematography & Editing are impressive. Art Design is excellent. The re-creation of the late 60's has been put-up, wonderfully. Music by Himesh Reshammiya is melodious. Performance-Wise: Himesh Reshammiya is alright. Although he has shed a lot of weight & has worked on himself, he can still work on his acting skills. Yo Yo Honey Singh, cast in a negative role, has his moments. Zoya Afroz looks gorgeous & delivers a very confident performance. Sonali Raut has also done well. Anant Mahadevan is stiff. Rajesh Sharma is superb, as always. Irrfan Khan appears in a tiny cameo. On the whole, 'The Xpose' holds limited appeal." 
" Boring & wannabe thriller movie but entertaining!","'The Xpose' is an entertaining yet boring 'thriller', or as the makers only call it a thriller. Personally, the film I found very funny. Especially the scenes where Himesh's character is being filmed, and he acts like he's a very big superstar. The film's story is decent, not too bad and not great either, but it's quite clichéd and predictable.After watching the trailer, you can take a few guesses on who you think is the murderer in the end, and one of those guesses is probably right, but I won't reveal the character and spoil it for you. The performances in the film are not as good as they should be in my opinion. Himesh is decent, probably better than his previous few films. Honey isn't bad, the debutant girls aren't that good and the supporting characters of people such as Anant Mahadevan, Rajesh Sharma and Dayashankar Pandey amongst others are alright.Actor Irrfan Khan is hardly even in the film, yet he's featured in the film's poster for some reason. He narrates some of the film (most of the first half) and also appears shortly in the first half, but doesn't really change the state of the film.The ending is extremely disappointing, and after a good second-half you'd think and expect an interesting climax, but it happens to be the most predictable thing possible I'd say. Not going to spoil the ending, I will not add any more, just the fact that if you enjoy suspenseful thrillers then you will probably NOT enjoy this film, as it tries hard to be in that genre but doesn't really work in my opinion.Also, I'd like to add that though the first half is more comedy, the second half is quite serious, and the second is probably the only suspenseful thing in the film. If you're bored, and looking for an entertaining (yet a film with an ending that will leave you disappointed and angry for why you wasted your time watching the whole film) movie then watch 'The Xpose' at your own risk."
