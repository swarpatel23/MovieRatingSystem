" As good as any Hollywood flick","First the comparison with Dhoom 1. It is repetitive in parts, especially because of the irritating Ali (Uday Chopra), who has outlived his utility in the first part. On the other hand, this has Hrithik and Ash, and is basically all about the duo! Abhishesk as Inspector Jai provides the continuity in the story, but this is Hrithik's film all the way. He packs in a great performance, looks awesome, fights, dances, cries, laughs and even kisses (yes, the infamous kiss!) all the way. Just watch this for him. Ash looks fabulous and puts in a great performance as well. The songs are a let down, except for the title number Dhoom machale. The story is good, however the ending is a let-down as compared with the first part. Don't listen to your pals who tell you that this is copied from numerous Hollywood movies. It's just that the intellectuals are jealous because Bollywood has finally managed to look as good as Hollywood!" 
" Not the best.... seen better","Having watched Sanjay Gadhvi's previous offerings (Mere Yaar ki Shaadi Hai and Dhoom 1) I had expected a brilliant film given that he had assembled the best cast he has ever worked with. Thus as I sat there the Canal Walk (Cape Town) cinema, my expectations were sky high.Opening sequence was promising and then that song! "Dhoom Again" performed by easily the best dancer in the world, masterfully choreographed by stage whiz shiamak davar. The film already had its plus points.However as the movie meandered on its course, the movie became more about gloss and less about substance.Each character - except Abishek, who apparently was left in the dark ages - have worked on their looks and appearance for their repsective roles, but did any of the brains trust at YashRaj expect the attractive to not just look the part, but portray it as well?The plot and screenplay was as skimpy as the clothing the female leads had to wear. Each and every sequence was copied from their superior Hollywood counterparts, and at many a times these looked like a lesser version of the original. At times the stunts were overly done.Plusses: * With the regular costume designers given a well-deserved break from designing actual clothes, the actresses were forced to wear little, if anything at all.... well for some of us, that is a plus! *Hritik Roshan and his dancing skills: is this guy for real? * The brilliant locales (Rio, Durban, Namibia) * Some good music {though some have been plagiarised from mid-east singers} * Bipasha and Aishwarya: HOT! Need we say more? *some touches of on-screen chemistry between ash and hritik, bips and abishek. * Choreography by Vaibhavi Merchant esp. Crazy Kiya re and Dil Laga NaaMinuses: * Aishwarya and Bipasha wasted in their respective roles. Both are noted actresses, and yet in this movie they are just used as glam dolls, mere props. Both ladies are there to look HOT and well they score points on that count only. Acting-wise,the less said, the better . And please fire the dialogue writer for Ash's character. * Abhisek BAchchan: his angry young dude role is somewhat lame and he looked like the odd one out. He needed a makeover, which the rest of the cast clearly had. * Forcing Abhisek to dance in the same movie or song as Hritik is like having a dance-off between a rank left-footed newcomer and an champion dancer. He looks laughable.Regardless of my rants and raves, D2 will continue to dominate the box-office while more superior old-fashioned films (Babul) with actual substance will find their vying for appreciation an uphill battle." 
" Dhoom..is only half the fizz!","Dhoom 1 wasn't a great movie but was refreshing and different! Dhoom 2..it's bigger, glossier and gets skimpier! Not just in terms of the clothes women wear, but also in terms of the script..if there is any! It's obvious that Mr Ghandvi lost focus, with all the star cast, glamour and money to splurge on the look. No doubt that the look was Super cool or flashy, locales breath taking, but if that is all that you are looking for then Dhoom 2 is for you! I don't expect movies..especially Hindi movies to cater to some High IQ needs of some viewers..I for one completely switch off my brain during the movie..but even by that standards there are some scenes that are too much to handle!! Especially the so called Chemistry scenes between ASH and Hrithik..oh god save me!!! Now, on to my take on the stars of the movie, Hrithik - was Simply Amazing. I am not a big Hrithik fan, have never been, but if there is any reason to watch this movie, it is Mr A! Roshan as A acts well, does some amazing stunts, dances beautifully (now that is nothing new!) and looks absolutely FAB!!! the movie belongs to him..ASH as sunehri - the less said the better..I may be a bit biased here for I am no fan of her's ..but seriously ASH is good as long as her mouth is shut or she is not trying to act (or over act!) seriously she is the most beautiful woman in the world ..but can someone teach her acting??? She looks good even if they may have made her a bit extra tanned!!Bipasha - well she was definitely a treat for the men ..but thats just abt it..not that you expect anything more from her..uday - he is the 'funny guy' in the movie..he is funny even when he does a serious role (in some other movies!) so ..well...ABBY BABY - now thats one man i went to watch the movie for,,but i was disappointed..he looks so tired and disinterested through out the movie..obviously he couldn't resolve his wt problems and being biased towards him its becuz of his preparation for guru..but his character was the least developed and all attention was given to hrithik!! but don't worry abby baby you have guru waiting! having said that ..he was good in two of the scenes he meets hrithik! Overall verdict - if you are easy going, tolerant and generally not bothered, have time or a big fan of hrithik i guess this movie will appeal to you. Else, don;t worry you are not missing muchDhoom 1 or Dhoom 2 - my choice Dhoom 1" 
" Wow !!","This movie was great.... I love it!! Two thumbs up for Hrithik being at his best look and acting.... Aishwarya was looking great too (didn't like some of her role though).... The plot was good.... A lot different than the first....Now for what i didn't like in the movie: Bipasha as a double role was not needed in it at all, and nor was the girl who played Abhishek's wife... These were just waste..... And the story didn't carry so much weight like the first one.... But it's acceptable because most sequels aren't good enough....Overall it was a good movie.... I enjoyed every moment of it.... The outfits, gadgets, music, dances and locations were great... And i also liked the way it surprised me to some extent....Some parts of the movie weren't acceptable to the family crowds but i guess that's completely okay compared to a lot of movies.... First of all this movie is not meant for kids, due to it's violence and women in scanty clothing... Which goes for Dhoom 1 as well..... anyway am sure a lot people enjoyed it..... so i give it an 8/10....." 
" Dhoom Again !!","OK, so I finally got to watch the much talked about, over-hyped sequel to the under-hyped sleeper hit of 2004. And I'm glad I did! It is what is called as the perfect time-pass, paisa vasool film.What Dhoom-2 lacks in terms of a coherent plot and neatly crafted screenplay, it more than compensates for through a clever and consistent sprinkling of awe-inspiring stunts, energetically choreographed dance routines, picture-perfect scene compositions and oodles of eye candy.Dhoom-2, like its predecessor, is the quintessential cop and robber tale where there's neither the place nor the need for logic. The film opens with a breathtaking visual of a lone train running through a vast Namibian desert. Though the execution of this robbery is disappointing (it almost seems that the writer and director felt that once they had a great setting, their task was done), it sets the stage for what would unfold over the next 2 hours. From then on we are drawn into a high-octane cat and mouse game (so what if the robber always has the upper hand...right till the end?). The action explodes with such energy that one doesn't get the time to think about the loopholes in the plot.Yes, after the movie is over you wonder if the film would have been much better had the writer made it into a mind game between the adversaries - a kind of intelligent oneupmanship. But as long as you're in the theatre, you're hooked on! You don't regret that the cop - who insists that such games are won by the mind and not the bullet - has virtually no plan except planting a mole. You don't mind that the mole - seemingly a consummate crook herself - doesn't show any skill except loads of sexual energy. And you certainly don't mind that Mr. Perfect Thief gets away unscathed every single time, thanks to - if I may use the word - a DUMB cop who appears dumber than his bumbling side-kick. All this, because of the charismatic screen presence of Hrithik Roshan.It wouldn't be wrong to say that Dhoom-2 belongs to Hrithik Roshan (Mr. A, Aryan). Mind you, that's not a tribute to his acting talent. He is at best an above-average actor, but when it comes to screen presence no one among the current crop of actors can come even closer to him. And boy, what a dancer! His dance movements are more unbelievable and awe-inspiring than the cable-supported, SFX-created action sequences. It is absolutely clear that Dhoom-2 was designed to be his showcase. How else would you explain the terribly underwritten character of the cop, or the fact that Hrithik is on the screen in 90% of the scenes?And then there's Ash (Sunehri). Could anyone believe that her 'plastic beauty' persona could actually set the screen afire? What has she done to her body! What a metamorphosis!! Ash's Sunehri is HOT. She and Hrithik come across as the most perfect screen pairing in recent memory. But, hey, what was all that hullabaloo about their lip-lock? On the acting front, Ash is adequate. All she is required to do is to look hot and be a perfect foil to Hrithik. She does precisely that with great élan. It's sad that Abhishek (Jai Dixit) got saddled with a hastily written role. It's unpardonable that the character of Jai Dixit, the main connecting link between the sequels - is so one-dimensional. Numerous reviews have lambasted Abhishek's acting in Dhoom-2, but the blame here lies with the producer-director-writer. They seem so hell bent on making this a showcase for Hrithik that they've given almost a step-motherly treatment to Abhishek's character. On his part, Abhishek honestly portrays what he's been asked to do.Uday Chopra (Ali) should find solace in the fact that his father and brother are the most successful producers in India and they will continue to find roles for him in their films. He has no acting talent whatsoever. Hats off to Aditya Chopra for using the clever ploy of giving Ali's character dozens of one-liners that manage to draw a few laughs from the audience and divert them from Uday Chopra's unbelievable yet unquestionable lack of acting skills.Should I get deeper into the negatives? For one, The music is very disappointing - had it not been for the Shaimak Davar's and Vaibhavi Merchant's choreography or Hrithik's and Ash's fluid dance movements the songs would have been unbearable to watch on screen. Also, despite a larger canvas and more style it doesn't cover any new ground compared to Dhoom....nah, I wouldn't get into all this. If one were to start, the list of negatives for Dhoom-2 might be quite long but why dwell on that? I found the film very entertaining and that's all that mattered to me while watching the film." 
" It is the "A" factor all the way","True there is nothing much in the movie except Hrithik and his special brand of charisma. But he alone makes the movie a little more than the usual claptrap entertainment. I personally feel he never looked better. His dance numbers are just perfect. Though there is little scope for acting in this flick, Hrithik does manage to give the character of Mr."A" a special flavor of his own. All the other characters are sort of sidelined. Pity, Abhishek Bachhan fades into obscurity beside Hrithik, both in looks and in performance. All in all, if you are a Hrithik fan this a must-see. If you are not, it is time to review your judgment." 
" sad state of affairs","I have no words to describe how disappointed I was with Dhoom 2. There was no story to speak of. There was no direction. I think the makers of Dhoom 2 would like to believe that the audience of Hindi films are like the audience of Teletubbies. Show some colorful scenes, some song and dance and we will all be happy and merry. I was impressed with what Bollywood movies have achieved in terms of technical wizardry, but was terribly let let down down by the movie makers' total lack of respect for the audience's intelligence.I read previous reviews about how Aishwarya Rai was 'hot' etc etc. There are a lot of 'hot' things out there if thats what people were looking for in this presentation. And Rai fails to impress in this regard. Her teen 'hep' character is contrived and shallow. Especially as the 'gritty' American girl who challenges her dude to a basket ball game. Most of Dhoom 2 is like that... a collage of borrowed concepts and montages which can be easily traced to their origins, giving a feeling of being cheated. Main Hoon Na did it with panache, but Dhoom 2 is a total waste of time. Yours and the film makers. (and mine, some might say, for writing this review)" 
" Great packaging; contents leave a lot to be desired","Dhoom 2, one of the most eagerly awaited movies of the year, is finally out. And how is it? It's okay.It looks great, brilliant locales, camera work, Hritik and Ash look excellent, too. But as far as a storyline goes, it disappoints. Unlike the first Dhoom, where there was a crisp storyline, supported by great stunts, this one has superb stunts trying to hold together a non-existent story.Ash is extremely annoying, from her first dialog onwards. Bipasha is wasted. Abhishek doesn't have that much to do and is more supporting cast than anything else. I can't stand Uday Chopra.Hritik is the best thing in the movie. He is cool, smooth and can take on action really well. However, compared to John Abraham's character in the first one, Hritik is a slightly kind hearted and emotional guy. I preferred Kabir's character cos he was really a bad boy. I don't know why they didn't go all the way with Hritik on that. It might have been better and Ashwairya's character could've been completely written off.All in all, watch it once cos its fun." 
" Dhoom-2 ......where?????","OK guys, lets face it. Without Hrithik the movie is nothing which otherwise too is nothing. Sorry, but that's an understatement. Where and what is the plot will someone explain??? The movie sure did showcase Hrithik's ability to take risks and do some adventurous stuff quo dos to that and a super duper physique, that girls would swoon for.Rest of the star-cast seems to be a wasted lot. Abhishek and Ash's real life comedy seems to be showing on screen as well. Who cares what happens to them. We want some life in the character that an actor is trying to portray--not attitude show off.And thanks to Bipasha Basu we learnt to do some aerobics. We shall try it out in a Beach when we go there!!!!!!!!Dhoom-2 is definitely for those people who rave and rant about looks, physique and short dress. Thank you very much, but there are still some human beings who care for a movie that's makes the movie a star and not a movie where the star/s can control the story. It seems like a desperate attempt to match the rest of the guys character to that of Hrithik's stunts. But nothing to beat Ash's pre-movie self publicity indulgence of having done dare devil stunts!!! What hogwash!!!!!" 
" Too much to tolerate","Viewers had too much expectations from this movie... But it turned out to be a biggest disaster... I watched the first day first show and regret it. Complete wastage of 3 hours... Hritik is the only good thing about the movie... Movie takes so many twists and turns, that it looks like they started it without a script only... there are loopholes in the script as big as grand canyon. The double role of Bipasa can't be explained in any possible way. The character of Abhishek is not at all defined... The emotions scenes are put in just for the sake of complete traditional Indian movie... It was too frustrating... I wish the distributors good luck!!!" 
" Well...-","Dhoom 2 is a mindless popcorn flick that asks for your brain at the door and hands it back 3 hours later when you leave, hoping you had a good time in between. I was amused more than once and I can appreciate several things in the film. But in the end the hard reality and number one rule of good film making is and always will be (and that really needs to sink in more in Bollywood): A GOOD FILM STARTS WITH A GOOD SCRIPT, EVEN IF ITS ONLY AIM IS CAREFREE ENTERTAINMENT FOR 3 HOURS. Dhoom 2's script is simply very half baked, full of plot holes so big the usual disclaimers for fantasy action fare are stretched too thin here and it becomes annoying. What should be a gripping tale of the psychology of cop and robber sprinkled with sleek action and display of technology (in the film and making the film) degrades into standard formula fare with unnecessary songs, forced comic routines, abrupt and unmotivated sight seeing orgies, and replacement of a main character. Let's ignore the heavy inspiration from many Hollywood films. That's not the main problem. The interference of the Bollywood formula and weak script is. Not all is bad, though, some parts are well done and in a better film would fit in very nicely. The Russian roulette scene is the emotional core of the film and delivers, ending included (bravo for going against the formula here). The statue scene is cool as well (unrealistic but in a way one can smilingly accept, l'art pour l'art). The Queen act at the beginning, unexpected, hilarious (the action afterwards less so). And this of course brings us to the main asset of the film, this Indian A list actor (and I mean international A list as far as potential is concerned) whose publicly announced goal is to lift commercial Hindi cinema to an international quality level so it can cross over, stuck in another local B grade effort (by international standards) limiting his impact: The one and only HRITHIK ROSHAN. He carries the film from start to finish and it hurts to see him work his ass off and exude more charisma with one finger than the whole cast of most films do with all they got, just to be let down by shoddy scripting and stylistic choices that might impress in some quarters but definitely not at others where international product is well known and fighting it out for market share with Hollywood. The rest of the cast is OK. Aishwarya and Hrithik are eye candy of the highest caliber. Abhishek, Uday and the rest have not really got roles though. 2 of the songs should be cut right away. 3 others are good. Film is well shot, stunts are OK although highly unrealistic most of the time and the fact many of them are really done by Hrithik himself is not obvious enough. He trains for 3 months and it's over in 3 seconds. Hm. See it if you like Ash and Hrithik, do not expect much and you will likely be impressed by some of it. 4 points for the film and 2 extra for Mr. Roshan. (By the way, Hrithik is NOT playing his first villain in this film as claimed in the promotions. He's not anymore a villain than Robin Hood. He's the hero of the film which you cheer on and want to succeed. If Robin Hood is a villain then Hrithik was a villain before in Fiza and Mission Kashmir)." 
" A Dumb Man's intelligent film","I went to the theater yesterday with a almost no expectations from this movie, as I had hated its predecessor (Dhoom). But it succeeded in confounding my expectations. This movie was worse than I expected. I felt awkward even sitting there and watching that drivel from the first scene to the last. The "story" is outlined this way. Hrithik Roshan is the meticulous and extremely successful Mr.A, who pulls off the most impossible robberies. He jumps of trains, manages to have his own against the most well prepared security forces, with gravity defying stunts and kicks, not to forget the "disguises". He is "disguised" as the queen to rob the queen's jewels. He steals the world's most priceless artefacts, not to sell them. Now enter, Jai Dixit and his half idiotic, low IQ friend, Ali (Abhishek and Uday). Their first scene where they capture a bunch of nitwit criminals is as unbelievable as it can get. He is joined by college buddy Shonali (Bipasha), in the hunt for Mr.A. They are always given the slip, by the wily Mr.A, who continues to rob the priceless items, with his brains and gizmos par excellence (how he funds these gizmos, god knows). Mr.A later meets his soul mate, during a robbery, where Suneheri (Aishwarya) uses The "A" name to rob a castle of a priceless sword. Suneheri and Mr.A form a deadly alliance and give the police a slip all the way. The story loses whatever little sanity it possessed, at this point and begins to meander way off course. This movie would have been slightly better with a fewer songs and some believable action scenes. It also desperately needs Direction and a script. Everyone except Hrithik sleepwalk through the movie. Aishwarya especially proves once again, that she is more a glam doll than a serious actor. Abhishek Bachchan sleepwalks through the film and his "Cool-dude", Shelock Holmes-esquire demeanour begins to irritate. Uday Chopra tries his hand at comedy, but comes up with lame ones most of the time. Bipasha Basu...Why was she there in the movie..?? Makes you wonder. Hrithik "saves" the day for Dhoom, doing some justice to his role. Coming to the technicals. Direction is not of very high quality. The Director (Gadhvi) has focused more on bikinis and skimpy clothes, rather than trying to make a slick, taught thriller. The dialogues are forced and have no impact whatsoever. The story could have been told much better with the actual presence of a SCRIPT. Pritam seems to be directing the same type of music. The music scores nothing. The cinematography shines like a diamond in all this muck, but could have gone easy on the slow motion. Half the scenes seem to be in slow motion.After all this, I can only say. If your spouse is nagging you really bad on a beautiful weekend and all you need, is to sleep. Then you might consider watching this film." 
" fast N furious, Italian Job, Miami Vice all packed together in Indian Cinema Style.. Smashing... *****","fantastic movie...from start to end a good time pass.. a 1000 times better than DON...If u liked the category of movies like fast n furious (1,2,3) and Italian Job, Miami Vice etc then u would surely Like this MOvie.. It has used some cool script and costume ideas from Bourne Identity, Lara craft, The Saint (Val Kilmer) and two more movies I can't recall but all in a good stylish Indian flavour.The story is packed with so many Punches both in stunts and in suspense that U won't get even a min for stretch etc..even songs are lovely too..You would need to adjust yourself to the pace and style of the movie right from beginning.. within minutes(may be secs) of its start..n many would whistle its catchy theme tone on way out..Hrithik and Aishwarya..Bollywood's God and Goddess have appeared together in a Movie First ever time.. and Aishwarya has given a Good Lip Kiss (won't call it a smooch) first time ever..Aishwarya has never looked so sexier before.. (and I thought the gals in FnF-Tokyo Drift were so sexy)..even tho she sizzles all DA time and melts the screen many times... many would agree with me that in DA movie this Nymph and celestial beauty was beaten first time in personality by Bollywood's only DEMI-GOD, a Rock Personality with the Face of an Angel,Eyes of an Elf Prince and Physique of Achillies..HRITHIK..It could be the Script (Aish eyeing Hrithik) or Cameraman's focus on Hrithik's face N personality..Or Aish admiring Hrithik's eyes..and convincingly succumbing to his magnanimous persona (which would be difficult to believe with any other actor)..This one-man-army is Bollywood's one-stop answer to Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and the likes of James Bond..or rather Shows a BIG ? to Hollywood.. HAVE YOU GOT AN ANSWER TO THIS MAN? Bipasa does her part well.. her acting n figure has improved a lot.. Uday did his part well too.... and sorry for all Abhishek's Fan (of his looks) his acting was good in this movie..but in terms of fast & furious looks..he was the only 1 who didn't fit there..ignorable bearded druggie looking dude...has anyone noticed that he slouches all DA time.. his neck wanna fell down to floor,, has a Lil double chin and has dark circles around his swollen eyes.. look at him carefully in DA movie...and u would notice all that.." 
" What's so good about this?","Come on people. Dhoom 2 cannot be a good movie. It has poor cinematography, poor music, poor actions sequences, too much over acting, over editing, poor choreography, poor choice of costumes, average special effects, and horrible story line that has been adopted from 10 or more Hollywood movies. It might be entertaining for some, but the movie is set in present day. How come abishek doesnot wear a uniform for being a cop? How come he knows almost every about Mr. A and other look so stupid. The Comedy scenes are rediculuosly filled with over acting and some dumb background music. There were at least 80 - 88 unnecessary scenes in this movie. There were too many things too unreal, if you are gonna make a movie like dhoom do it realistically, we r not in the 90 or 80s any more, we are in 2006 people. If Some one handed me 90 crores to make this movie i would have done a hell lot better. Why are there many remixes in the soundtrack to dhoom? Overall, im a movie lover, but not for these kind of movies. Dhoom 2 is a big disappointment. Come on bollywood why are you adapting so many stories and plots from Hollywood, what happened to you creativity? Where are the great awesome movies? Be original n Be real!" 
" A doomed experiment! ** HEAVY SPOILERS **","I watched this one in installments. The first 15 minutes go by - 1. Thief para drops right onto a moving train 2. The queen has the most brattish kids running around - do they not know what royal kids are like? 3. The queen coincidentally has a long face and beaked nose just like the thief - what was he, her long lost son or something? 4. The queen has guards that fire bullets that cannot penetrate a surfboard and are super slow - the thief can deflect them one after the other.5. The queen hires security guards that cannot shoot at a man who is hooked up to the train and being pulled behind it on a surf board.6. The thief has a supernatural surfboard that can cross over train tracks and go from side to side.7. The thief then surfboards away among sand dunes - is the surfboard motorized? we are now 5 - 6 minutes into the film...8. cut to a hot number with lots of hip grinding dance moves, muscled thief and scantily clad babes and all...9. cut to a boat onto which a motorcycle lands and stops just like that. Had to close my eyes and sit through some annoying Uday Chopra dialogs 10. Two bad guys have guns drawn on him and they wait, and they wait, and they wait 11. A jet boat comes out from UNDER water, flies sky high and lands on the boat and stops just like that.12. Is the boat an aircraft carrier? 13. People stand around and shoot at each other, now no one even makes a pretense of ducking.14. Amidst all the shooting and standing around the phone rings and some Bangla conversation starts.This queen - he/she was the ugliest royal I have ever seen - but then of course in Dhoom 3 Mr. A will turn out to be her illegitimate son and so they had to resemble each other! I have watched a bit more to catch the most beautiful woman but no appearance yet.. In the meantime 15. Uday and Abhishek are having inane conversation while still shooting at the bad guys. Is this supposed to be humorous? 16. Abhishek is doing his best to imitate an inanimate object that can talk.17. Bipasha is hot but which respectable police officer walks with that exaggerated hip sway? looks like a model for Old Navy clothes.18. Bipasha says they know nothing about Mr. A, while random maps and faces keep flashing on the screen - whose faces are these?19. Abhishek now shows that he is an intelligent inanimate object.. he has cracked the code, by God! 20. Mr. A masquerades as a statue and runs the Mars Rover over the floor to a diamond he wishes to steal.21. The rover appears to be smarter than any human being in the movie.22. It can not only steal the diamond just like that but can create an illusion that the diamond is still there.. I knew that alien technology existed in Roswell.23. Then suddenly the statue is an old man - I loved to watch the Transformers and maybe Mr. Gadhvi did too! 24. The old man drops into the sewer after melting the cover with acid in his shoes.25. The young Mr. A explodes out of the sewer in an unknown location.. I always knew the sewers were full of explosive gases.26. The chase is on - Abhishek is suddenly on a chopper and shooting at Mr. A from the air.27. Mr. A ducks each and every shot - now we know why the police in India are incompetent. No one taught them how to accurately shoot a gun.28. Mr. A jumps on and off various vehicles using some LED containing device on his hands.. Roswell all over again.29. Mr. A roller blades on a narrow, I mean real narrow, railing and escapes.30. There is still no sign of the most beautiful woman and I have to turn the show off in frustration.Try number 3 - 31. The most beautiful woman comes on and speaks in valley girl speak the entire time I can bear to see this movie.32. She also addresses herself in the third person, uses "like" in EVERY sentence, ends it with "funny guyyy".I bravely soldier on...A word about the Music and the acting: To match My name is Ali we have Crazy Kiya Re, every song is at that level including something that is going 'Yeh love to Hai fire..' with a lot of what sounds like doom doom! So the entire soundtrack seems to be a comic turn. Hritik is good, OK acting, nice bod - too bad he has no credible story line or plot to match his acting. Aish is so annoying I cannot believe it, every sentence is like inane enough to drive one insane. Uday is annoying as hell and Abhishek is virtually inanimate. Bipasha is hot but what is she doing in the film? If you can bear to part with your brain for three hours, check it in at the popcorn place, and go in to see this film. If you were recently hit on the head then you might not need this. Enjoy!" 
" Review of Dhoom 2","Dhoom-2 opens with a "somewhere in Namibia desert" opening scene and instantly gives its game away. What follows over the next couple of hours is a rehash of MI-2-meets-Ocean's-Eleven-heist-movie that makes being stranded on a Namibian desert sound like a better alternative. The plot is absurd and the script bumbles along from one event to another with an array of songs that kill the continuity, if any was meant in the first place.Abhishek's skills of inference and deduction never cease to amaze (he figures the next location where the genius thief is going to make his attempt by a two-second study of map patterns and by feverishly tapping a laptop key four times in quick succession), but his gruff demeanor leaves him looking like he'd rather be doing something else. Make no mistake, Aishwarya is awesomely irritating and left me stunned with her strange vocabulary. She peppers her lines with strange words  Sample: "funny guy" and "like" which was the third word in any dialogue she spoke. Besides, she persistently refers to herself only in the third person and after watching her for a bit, you wonder if she was better off on the Jerry Springer show rather than the Oprah Winfrey stint she got invited to. Then there is Uday Chopra. He looks like he's walked straight out of X-Men with odd bulbous biceps and acting skills equivalent of mammoth Amazon rain forest.Redemption comes in the form of Hrithik Roshan who's all toned abs-latino look is the only thing that works here. He appears completely convincing doing all those gravity-defying jumping, kicking, skating and rappelling. But he's the lone warrior in a losing battle.The music is as it usually is these days  catchy tunes, contemporary lingo and a host of electronic sounds, the visuals are pleasing but overall, Dhoom-2 is perilously close to a near-death experience if there is indeed such a thing. Its an insult to your intelligence and reflective of the crap that Bollywood churns out with shameless regularity."
