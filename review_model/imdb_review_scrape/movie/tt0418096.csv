" Night Shyamalan Indian Style","Bipasha Basu is caked with so much makeup t'would make Barbie squirm. Oof. Her acting talents leave a lot to be desired, her Hindustani diction sucks and frankly I do not see her going places in films; at least films with any substance. Sanjay Dutt gives another wooden performance and Suniel Shetty bores with his mentally handicapped style and dialogue deliverance. Moraes does come across as a viable villain and is the most believable in this rather predictable and flat film on communication from the beyond. The most annoying feature of the DVD was the sound that jumped into deafening sound effects and then dropped to very low on dialogue. A horror film it is not. The only thing that made me jump was the sound effects which are jarring." 
" eRakht","Saw this movie starring some of my favorite stars: Bips, Sanjay Dutt & Suneil Shetty.Medium: VHS @ Home Noticeable: Perfect remake of English movie "Gift".Wonderful depiction and performance from Bips. The others were fairly standard in their character portrayal. Catchy locales and opening! The suspense was very nicely built up for a Bollywood movie.There could have been some better songs and some good sequences but I think the producers decided to keep it a faithful remake of the Gift. The name, Dhristi was awesome!What's new: Pretty much nothing! Overall: Great Thriller! Good climax." 
" If only I were the director of this movie","The first thing that I am willing to say is that I wish I were the director of this movie. Good direction can convert an average script into an admirable movie and poor direction can spoil even the greatest script. And that's what exactly happened to this flick produced by the liquor-cum-aviation baron, Vijay Mallya; whose plot has been lifted straightaway from a Hollywood movie - The Gift (2000).There is an ancient Indian maxim - JISKA KAAM USI KO SAAJE, AUR KARRE TO PAAGAL BAAJE (one should do that job only which suits him or in which he is skilled; if he does someone else' job, he will be considered mad because he will fail miserably at that). And that's what I am willing to convey to Mahesh Manjrekar, the director of hard-hitting, realistic and touching movies like - Vaastav, Tera Mera Saath Rahe, Nidaan, Ehsaas, City of Gold etc. Making a good suspense-thriller is not anybody's cup of tea. There was a time in Bollywood when brilliant suspense-thriller specialists like Raj Khosla, Raja Nawathe, Shankar Mukherjee, Biren Nag, Raghunath Jhalani and even B.R. Chopra were active in the field who gave us memorable suspense-thrillers like Humraaz, Mera Saaya, Woh Kaun Thi, Gumnaam, Mahal, Kohra, Anamika, Uljhan, Kanoon, Dhund etc. Now there are no such directors with the exception of Abbas-Mustan. Mahesh Manjrekar made an attempt to do their job, falling flat on his face. He could not just handle the brilliant script stolen from The Gift in his inexperienced hands (for this type of movie). Had Raj Khosla made this movie during the sixties or the seventies, it could have been a classic.It's a murder-mystery with insertion of supernatural element through the God-given capability of the main protagonist (Bipasha Basu) to foresee future events. She is a single mother (widow) of an eight years old son, other than being a tarot card reader and an astrologer by her profession. The mystery is of the murder of Amrita Arora who first goes missing and then is found murdered with her dead body lying in a lake. There are many characters associated with the life of the central character of the movie, i.e., Bipasha, viz. Sanjay Dutt who is the principal of her son's school, Payal Rohatgi who is her friend, Neha Dhupia who is her another friend, Dino Morea who is a rowdy and Neha's wife-beater husband, Sunil Shetty who is a crazy motor-mechanic and considers Bipasha as his good friend, Shashikala who is her granny and whose spirit comes to bless her after death (Bipasha doesn't know by that time that her granny is no more), Himanshu Mallik who was Amrita's secret lover, Abhishek Bachchan who is her ex-beau etc. Finally the face of the murderer is revealed, bringing an end to the suspense after many scenes which involve the police activity and the court-room arguments of the lawyers involved too.The treatment of this excellent plot is not at all coherent and impressive and the only face-saving grace is the outstanding performance of Bipasha alongwith some really good scenes (the best one, in my opinion, is the scene in which the spirit of Bipasha's granny, Shashikala gets evaporated into the air in front of her eyes). Due to poor direction, the movie which could have become an excellent one on overall basis, has been reduced to an assembly of some good and some bad scenes. It was promoted as a spine-chilling thriller but there is neither any chill for the viewer's spine, nor any good suspense (most of the viewers can guess the real murderer with relative ease), nor any momentum to keep the viewer continuously on the edge of his seat. The script of a good suspense-thriller should be well-knit and all the incidents being shown on the screen should have a logical association among them whereas the narrative of Rakht seems to be scattering here and there amidst the scenes which have not been sensibly linked and kept in proper sequence.Anand Raj Anand's music is passable. Two songs are good though. However these songs as well as the flash-back entry of Abhishek Bachchan only block the flow of the narrative. Had I directed this movie, either I would have made it sans any songs or would have made the music team prepare at least one good mystery song (in terms of words and composition) deepening the mist in the story.I am a die-hard fan of Bipasha Basu and hence my opinion towards her performance may be biased. Still the viewers will agree that she is the pivotal character of the story around whom the other ones move in a circle. And it's her only who keeps the viewer's interest alive in the movie. Though performers like Sunil Shetty, Dino Morea, Sanjay Dutt, Neha Dhupia etc. have tried their best to do justice to their assigned roles, the problem is that their characters have not been properly developed in the movie. They are sketchy and therefore, fail to leave a mark.Cinematography and technical aspects of the movie are more or less OK. Background score is also OK though I have already mentioned that the movie fails to scare despite the tall claims of its makers. Besides, it's not a horror movie; it's a suspense movie.Still, I recommend this movie to the fans of Bipasha Basu as well as those who like mysteries very much because though it's not well made, the story is pretty good. The mystery-fans who have not watched the Hollywood movie - The Gift, may like it as a one time watch. My overall rating for the movie is 2.5 stars. It could have become a movie worth the rating of 4 or 5 stars, had it been directed by Jitendra Mathur instead of Mahesh Manjrekar." 
" So What! If I can see the future?","God only knows why a director such as Mahesh Manjrekar would make such a movie. It starts of slightly original and ends up being a direct "rip off" of "The Gift", which stars Keanu Reeves and Cate Blanchett, lifted scene-for-scene.Mahesh is usually a great director doing original material, and this movie makes you wonder why he has gone down this route. Bollywood needs to steer clear of doing direct rip-off movies, such as Hum Kaun Hai (2004) which is "The Others" with Nicole Kidman. If they do copy the idea, they should significantly change it.If you have seen "The Gift", a great movie by Sam Raimi, steer clear of this one, but if you haven't, you may like it. If you do watch it, it'll be for Bipasha Basu (wow) who is always a pleasure to watch, for her beauty and her acting. There's and a good performance from Sunil Shetty (not playing the tough guy for once).Sadly, 3/10" 
" So what if it's a remake?","I don't understand why so many people get bent over if a movie is a remake or not. If the movie just remake everything right then it'll be enjoyable.Sure the movie is a remake of Hollywood's The Gift. So what! Even Hollywood movies had been remade before. No big deal.While watching the film, flashback of the original movie The Gift kept popping in my mind. It didn't bother me. I just like to see how Bollywood would pull this off.I loved Rakht. Bips is a natural and is the best. Everyone in the film fitted perfectly. Some argued that Suniel's character was strange but not me. He was awesome. The only person I was disappointed in is Yana Gupta! Yes, she's there for an item number but I felt her item number was overrated. Give me "One Love" any day!This is a Bollywood style movie so that's why it has a "happy" ending." 
" Rakht-Bloody bore","A lot has been expected from this suppose to be a bone-chilling super-natural thriller, especially when it is a product from Mahesh V. Manjrekar's stable but alas it proved to be a dud. The only interesting thing in this film is with each happening, you can put a how or why and look for answers till the end. A mother -cum-widow-cum-tarot card reader-cum-astrologer (Bipasha Basu) not just predict the mishaps of the future but also occasionally helped by souls of dead people. It's been told that her livelihood is only husband's insurance and people's charity but still she manages to live in a lavish bungalow alone with no servant. So that whenever she had a nightmare she can shiver alone and cannot run anywhere else for help. One of the most noisiest sound track (heightened effects) of recent times and a narration is as slow as a snail, what else can be said about this pathetic piece of work. It makes your blood boil." 
" I give it an 8 just based on the songs!","It's an annoying remake of the better film 'The Gift' but the only saving grace for 'Rakht' is the really nice songs that are included. Especially 'One Love' which is one of the best commercial songs I have ever seen in a bollywood film. The video for it is nice as well, with Abhishek Bachchan (who is shamefully wasted and exploited in the film) and Bipasha Basu (playing the Cate Blanchett role) picturing the wonderful song with such playful flirtation, it's inspiring! If the directors were not so preoccupied with doing a scene by scene copy of the former, maybe they would have been able to add some spice to their remake. My 8 out of 10 stars vote is strictly for the song and dance numbers which are a really nice addition to the film. The script (however copied and executed) gets a 4 at best!" 
" Disappointing","Mahesh Manjerekar has made several films like VAASTAV, ASTITVA after which his films failed to click at the BO yet many got critical acclaim RAKHT made him try horror for the first time and he signed his fav Sanjay Dutt, Suneil Shetty alongwith Dino, Himanshu.etc He cast Bipasha in the main role The film is inspired from THE GIFT however it also is similar to 100 Days(1991) a Hindi film which itself was remade from some Hollywood film. The film however could've been interesting fails overall. The start of the film is good, slowly Mahesh introduces half a dozen subplots and all seems well. They are some interesting characters like Dino, Suneil Shetty. even Amrita Arora's character keeps you guessing. One joke is that in the film Bipasha can foresee other people's future but cant help herself. The film also gets slow paced and the audience gets fidgety. Even Abhishek's character(was added much later in the film after half the shooting was over) seems like an add-on. The climax is a downer, with all of a sudden things sorted out in typical Bollywood manner. There are several scenes hard to digest tooDirection by Mahesh Manjerekar could be better though some scenes are well handled Music is good, Quero is good, One Love is well adapted though not as good as the original, the best song is Jannat hai Yeh ZameenAmongst actors Bipasha in the main role does her role well and suits the part. Sanjay Dutt is restrained, Suneil Shetty is superb in an unusual role Dino Morea surprises with an excellent performance(kudos to Mahesh) Amrita Arora is superb, Neha Dhupia is okay, Payal Rohatgi is alright Himanshu Malik is not too convincing, he never impressed as an actor otherwise too Rajat Bedi, Sharat Saxena, Shashikala, Shivaji Satham are okay"
