" Good direction could turn it into a much much better one..","Sometimes you don't expect much out of the things but you feel happy when you really get more. Ru-ba-ru is such a movie that will give you similar feeling. I always saw something different in Hooda's acting and this movie again proved he is front in the queue to next superstar. Movie starts a little slowly and I will say some sloppy direction can turn off your mood. But after around 45 minutes movie takes a 90 degree turn and transformed into a thriller. I would say better direction could make it a wonderful watch but apparently it's not. In first few scenes, it looks like there is big big mistake in the dialogue sync between Randeep and Sahana. Anyways last one hr of the movie, when Randeep is starving hard to change the fate, brings movie back in the tone. Mysterious character of Kulbhushan Kharbanda as a Taxi driver makes you feel like presence of God or super natural power. The best part of the movie is its ending and it really feel great watching a short movie with some perfect ending. I must say its a must watch movie, not because of its direction, but because of its storyline, concept and some very good acting by Randeep." 
" A Wonderful, Thrilling and Romantic Story","The film story is really great. Though its just a twisted version of an awesome Hollywood movie "If Only", it still leaves you sticked to your seats.I really enjoyed it, that too when, (having watched "If Only" earlier) I already knew the story. It must be because the Director has done a good job while trying to add an Indian taste to the movie. In which, I guess he decently succeeded.A good one for couples[;)].Shahana Goswami has done a good job and same goes for Randeep Hooda. The cast perfectly supports the story.And of course,it might help you in solving your relationship problems [;)].So,if you are looking for a Thrilling experience with a spicy taste of Romance .... go for it." 
" A Thrilling Eye Opener","I am rating this movie 10/10 because it deserves it and its all is for the plot and acting. It's an eye-opener for all of us who never realizes the importance & status of our loved ones and IF we never ever get the chance to tell them how much we love them, we will be ruined, self-destructed and awfully sad.This movie have created the feel, believe me when you finished watching it you will either be thinking about your loved ones or you already have planned how you treasure every moment with them. Ru-Ba-Ru is a magical, thrilling and revealing experience about Love and Relationships. A must watch!...specially for couples :)" 
" Bad movie !","This one was a let down , very boring infact I would say . Didn't like it at all ." 
" Very good!!","This is a wonderful movie, sadly ignored by the audience. The movie is so thrilling towards the end, and the climax is a shock. It was such a shock that I chopped off the final scene from the movie file I had!!! The movie is about déjà vu, a feeling of experiencing something that seems to be experienced earlier. It is really interesting, I watched the movie without any hope, and loved it. The performances are good, and there is a good chemistry between the lead couple. The title song is also very good. The movie drags somewhere in the second hour, but things go to the peak towards the ending. Also, there are several thrilling moments in the movie. Such movies should be promoted, instead of crap PJ movies." 
" Loved it","One of the very best (In heroine's words - Bestest ;-) ) movies I have seen recently.I know that this is copied from an English movie (I think from the movie 'If Only'). But may be since I have not seen the original yet, I just loved the plot and the way the movie is taken. A very romantic movie, something very apt to see with your lover on a valentines day or with your wife immediately after marriage or on an anniversary day. This movie can really wake up all the romance in you.The hero and heroine appeared so nicely together. Climax was brilliant. Director did a decent job. All the actors justified their roles in most of the scenes. Background score and camera was also really nice.To tell about the negatives, somewhere in the second half of the movie, I felt some scenes were a bit lagging. In very few scenes hero's acting was weird. Songs could have been better.So I am giving 8/10 for this movie, with a strong advice to watch this special movie with your lover on a romantic evening for sure." 
" Ru-ba-Ru a.ka Dejavu ...","Its me that i have that habit of watching movies irrespective of box office talks or what other people feel for the movie . i feel that someone has made movie and would put have lot of effort in it , so i watch them with every intention of film being good .Really i must say decent effort by all of them related to this movie ... i must say this - i wasn't expecting this movie to be anywhere near good ... one thing about this movie was the duration ... it wasn't long enough to get u bored .. Shahana Goswami who also featured in Rock on !!! .. was impressed with her in this movie ... Randeep hooda - i was expecting him to be much better than this ... really low point of the movie was songs ... better don't add songs ..." 
" This was a Good Movie.","*** This is my FIRST movie RATING (Please excuse my immaturity in words!) ***Based on my opinion, and I know that not many people have seen or even heard of this title but I liked this movie. The acting of the stars was alright, the actors in the movie are new ones but they were still alright. The story is that a guy has a... (SPOILER...) dream that his wife dies because of his irresponsibility (She dies after getting into a Taxi alone and broken hearted and ends up getting rammed by a drunk driver. Then he goes back home and falls asleep crying like a deer. The next morning he wakes up and notices that his dream, (which takes up half of the movie) was just a dream... as the day goes on... everything that happened in his dream that led up to his wife's death happens in real life. Everyone convinces him that he was just experiencing a Deja Vu. At the end of the movie, he gets IN with his wife on the Taxi and they end up getting rammed by a drunk driver, but instead... the guy dies and the girls lives. The movie ends with her sobbing like a bear in the hospital. Overall... a good past time movie." 
" Great story, well executed. Definitely worth watching.","A different from run-of-the-mill romances. Based on Hollywood title "If Only" (so credit for story should go somewhere else), it is a well-made movie. Both Randeep and Shahana have done a very good job of bringing the story to life. Songs are also reasonably good. So I have no idea why the ratings are so low.Suggestion: do NOT read spoiler reviews or Wikipedia entry. There is much magic in finding out how it ends." 
" One world "Amazingggggg" !!!","Well, i was apprehensive about watching it as it's a remake of an Hollywood movie "If Only". But somehow my partner persuaded me to watch. But to my surprise,it was an amazing movie to watch. Movie is very well connected. Randeep hooda is astonishing. I have seen his great acting skills in other movies but here it was all about him. And he has carried movie so well on his shoulders. He was as amazing in the second half as he was in the first half. Movie is very well edited and seriously a good watch and will definitely last an impression like "If only" did. Very very impressed.... Specially... Randeep hooda...thumbs up....." 
" If Only... Randeep and Shahana could hook up in real life...","This is a bunch of movies all rolled into one but in its own unique way, it manages to stand out. A busy business man forgets to show affection to his lady love until a horrible tragedy wakes him up but it is too late? It is mainly based on the Jennifer Love Hewitt starer 'If Only' but it also has elements of Sandra Bullock's 'Premonition' and Gwyneth Paltrow's 'Sliding Doors' in it. The ending was very shocking and the chemistry between the two main leads (Randeep Hooda and Shahana Goswami) was off-the-screen hot! A must watch for all Bollywood film enthusiasts." 
" not good at all-stay away","Very boring film, it is a copy of the American film "If Only", but it is a terrible copy. The acting by Randeep Hooda, is not up to par, and neither is the new actress, director Arjun Bali has made a terrible debut with the film. Some songs are OK, actually the soundtrack was good, but some songs are not even filmed from the soundtrack(Why Not????) Very disappointed, the story is filmed and told in a bad manner, and on the DVD there is no alternate ending...it was a bad ending, predictable because they had shown it 30 minutes before it happened in a flashback sequence. Advice for Arjun Bali...I don't know what you were thinking when you directed this...but please next time think before your pick a story to direct."
