" This Queen blazing guns!","Brash, offbeat, unconventional - this sums up the latest outing of the latest Queen of Bollywood, Kangana Ranaut. This bandit queen avatar of hers is no less interesting where she immaculately displays the anger, attitude, madness, vulnerability and insecurities of Alka Singh. Boss, Kangana has literally replaced Vidya Balan in the territory of varied women-oriented dhansu films (2 in a row this year itself)!As far as the movie is concerned, the storyline lacks depth but it is the realistic performances of all actors which infuses life in the movie. Director Sai Kabir has literally tread Tigmanshu Dhulia's lanes with this one. Another good part of the movies is the surprise element and twists and turns it keeps throwing till the last scene making it pacy and thrilling, esp in the second half.Madhya Pradesh, the bihads of Morena and Chambal and local politics literally come alive on screen. Enough comic value is added by melodramatic characters, their mannerisms and Hinglish takia kalams. Vir Das has for the first time got a chance to play a lead role (though the hero remains Kangana), but he doesn't disappoint. All other actors esp. Piyush Mishra as 'Mama' do full justice to their roles.Music is as unconventional as the movie (Nice to hear Asha Bhosle and Usha Uthup after long).Verdict: Not meant for all. Only those who are really interested in off- beat and non-mainstream (typical rom coms type) cinema, should venture in.My rating: *** Â½P.S.: The symbolic comparison of our (Revolver) Rani with Rani Laxmibai in the climax should not be missed.:)" 
" 'Revolver Rani' is a proper Bollywood satire, consisting of intelligent writing, dark humour and terrific parodies.","'Revolver Rani' is a proper Bollywood satire, consisting of intelligent writing, dark humour and terrific parodies. And I never expected Hindi Cinema to properly pull off such a thing. Other than the smart screenplay, it's Kangana Ranaut's terrific acting prowess which makes the satire effective. The films takes a lot of hilarious jabs at mob rivalries, politics, religious and cultural issues, Bollywood industry, and most of all, our very human nature.Kangana plays the role of the lead protagonist Alka Singh, who is a gun-blazing mob-head and political leader. Brought up without parents, and only by her uncle, she's a cold-hearted leader seduced by an aspiring actor only for his gain. It's the political rivalry between the two mobs which forms the basic premise of the story. The supporting performances are quite commendable, especially that of Piyush Mishra, who plays Alka's uncle.And people who are calling it a remake of Kill Bill are out of their minds. Other than one or two inspired moments from the Taratino Violence saga, the movie is completely original.The movie can only be enjoyed by people who can understand political satires and like black comedies." 
" Weird, brutal but interesting","Director Mr. Sai Kabir work is very good. He was not bothered about right or wrong about general perception of hit film but he was celerity of mind regarding this film. Very small characters are justified well. Story is new and different. Screenplay is very good. Dialogues support the film well. Credit goes to writer and Director Mr. Sai Kabir. Neither the promo nor the title of the film was indicating any emotional quotient but this film has that emotional touch and in a very good way. A shot justifies the title well where just keeping the gun behind her palm, makes her heart beating again. I just loved this scene and concept. This film deserves sequel and makers have clearly justified it. Even very fine things and emotions are taken care in good way through scene and shots. Humor is placed in very subtle but appropriate way. Goon uses his lower part of Kurta for blowing air is one of such example. Performance wise Kangana Ranaut is out standing. Vir Das is OK. Piyush Mishra is very good. Jakir Hussain is fine. Music is OK and it gives the required support in emotional scenes." 
" Worthy of a sequel, a series and a graphic novel!","This is my first ever review on IMDb.After watching Revolver Rani ("RR"), I can be sure Sai Kabir (writer, director) had been looking for a producer like Tigmanshu Dhulia for a while. This is a work straight from the heart and feels like it too!The story of Revolver Rani, Alka Singh (Kangana Ranaut) takes place in India's dacoit heartland Chambal, where law has seldom held up. All characters have enough reason to be in the movie. Performances are up to the mark. The dialect spoken by the actors seems authentic. Starting with Kangana - she has played one of the most audacious female leads in Hindi cinema and has come away with flying colors. Vir Das plays the meatiest role of his Bollywood career in aspiring film star Rohan. His character adds most twists to the plot than anything else and thus is a very important one. Piyush Mishra has played many memorable roles by now and his role as Alka's mama in RR as well his contribution to the writing department will not go unnoticed. His character even writes speeches for politicians in the film, which is a tribute to his writing ability, as it was with Mishra's poetry scenes in Gulaal. The other baddies draw your resentment as required.The music does wonders for each scene - it heightens the drama, transforms wee Kangana into stupendous Alka, draws laughs from scenes with dark characters and many more. Usha Uthup's voice seems to be only female voice bold and deep enough to tell Revolver Rani's story, like it does in the opening credits. The opening credits animated scene (similar to that of Bullett Raja) is so cool, that my wallpaper is now stolen from it. In fact, I have found in Dhulia-produced Revolver Rani what I went looking for in Dhulia-directed Bullett Raja.This is the kind of story which deserves more than one film as its characters can actually do so much more than they did in RR. My suggestion is - make a sequel, no, a series... and print some Revolver Rani graphic novels too while you are at it! That is, if those bad guys let the much cussed-at Alka live in RR." 
" Revolver Rani : A Puppet For Her Uncle's Political Ambitions","Kangana Ranaut has always been bold enough to take on roles that any normal actress may easily turn down. Considering Kangana's recent choice of films, I was expecting a lot from Revolver Rani. Her acting is uninhibited, and she portrays the character of Alka Singh well. Despite Kangana , Vir Das, and Piyush Mishra who all showcase great talent, one can't help but wait for all the unnecessary firing of rounds of ammunition to stop. But essentially that's what this film is about. The story, screenplay, and direction by Sai Kabir (who makes his directorial debut) falls a little flat at times. The shooting of bullets is just plain overkill. The film seemed to be a little scattered at times, and lacked a central focus. Almost like 3 directors directed it, each with his own protagonist. Where the screenplay fell short, the film made up for in terms of good acting, good general plot, and dialogue. Special mention is necessary for the way Kangana delivered Rani's dialogues, her attire, her sunglasses and clothes from "Italy", and her general naivety towards the dangers that lurk on home territory.Battling for power in Morena, Alka Singh with her deliberately dark skin, metallic bras, and entourage of political goons is unabashedly direct. She displays her sexual desire for Vir Das (her Bollywood boy- toy) without any hesitation. She shoots her guns when she is happy, angry, to get attention, and sometimes just for the hell of it. She is not afraid to beat up anyone, and almost reminds one of Gabbar Singh. She masterfully played the role of an almost illiterate girl from a backward area to the T, accent and all. The dirty game of politics unfolds quite tactfully as Alka Singh's selfish uncle (Piyush Mishra) asks her to abort the baby she is carrying. He goes to great lengths to ensure she doesn't go through with the pregnancy. Her giving birth would mean the end of a legacy that he built using Alka for 25 years. The story is interesting, if it weren't for those darn bullets they kept firing. The twist in the story comes after she decides to go on with her baby despite the pleas and threats from her Uncle.Some subtle sarcastic humor comes from the three brothers who are in the opposing party. This story has potential and could have been executed in better manner.The ending was interesting and looks like there will be a sequel. I hope the director will consider all these things the second time around.Overall, it's not a bad watch. One time only though." 
" What a mess made out of a fine plot and a talented cast.","Directed by the renowned theater veteran Feroz Abbas Khan as his second film post GANDHI, MY FATHER (2007), this is indeed a courageous attempt by the makers, since there When they released its first teaser, everybody got excited riding on the QUEEN wave assuming that here comes another gem from the talented yet under-rated actress Kangna Ranaut. But the impact reduced a lot just after a few days, with the film's complete theatrical trailer coming in having numerous shot being blindly fired by every character on the screen just like some uncontrollable kids. So the doubts were clearly there watching the 2-3 minute glimpses and they all came true as I watched REVLOVER RANI this Friday with a mixed kind of excitement.Directed by Sai Kabir with an inspired vision reminding you of explosive films by Tigmashu Dhulia, Anurag Kashyap and to some extent RGV too, the film no doubt walks on some ground breaking lines initially. But only after the first 30 minutes, it simply becomes anybody's guess that this is yet another example of those bad films with excellent promotional stuff fooling the audience. Strangely progressing with many weird insertions REVOLVER RANI even becomes intolerable post intermission and that is the reason I witnessed a few youngsters moving out of the theater too shouting out loudly cursing the makers.In short, nothing really works in this film having an extremely potent plot with a huge potential. The direction portrays it all in a silly kind of lazy mode with an equally less energetic background score having quite weak arrangements and the performances too fail to pick it up ever in the entire duration. Here I would not like to blame the writer completely as he does come up with few interesting sequences at regular intervals. But it's the execution of the twists which fails to impress the viewer throughout, turning them to something bizarre too at times. Cinematography & productions values constantly give you the feeling of watching something above the routine. But the poor to mediocre songs act as a few more nails in the ready coffin visibly. The director tries his best to convert everything beautiful into ugly following an intentional mode and such is his confidence in this unusual product that he even goes on to add another ugly scene in the end pointing towards a sequel too.Honestly REVOLVER RANI remains a perfect example of the truth that actually a film is all there in the mind of a director only and the actors are just performing their individual scenes as given to them on the sets. Because here you can clearly see every single actor in the film performing as if he is acting in a cult movie, to the best of his or her ability, without having any idea of what it's going to be as a final product in front of the real audience sitting in the theater. Kangna tries to behave as cruelly (or kinky) as possible with her given lines and Vir Das works hard to provide the lighter moments required through his great comic timing. Plus we also have Piyush Mishra, Zakir Hussain, Kumud Mishra, Pankaj Saraswat & Zeishan Quadri too giving their sincere performances offering some timely pleasure.Yet there is no QUEEN here in REVOLVER RANI and the film is a big mess despite having such talented names in the cast." 
" Revolver Rani : All Guns and no Roses","In a typical nod to Bollywood-meets-Quentin Tarantino style of film- making , debutante director Sai Kabir explores the dark underbelly of power and politics in the alleys of Chambal with Revolver Rani.The most powerful factor in this enterprise is of course,Kangana Ranaut,essaying the titular character with ferocious intensity.As the eccentric,moody, and sexually ravenous bandit turned politician Alka Singh who has just lost elections to her wily rival,Uday bhan Singh(Zakir Hussain) she sets the stage on fire whenever she delivers a public speech with her local lingo or when she is on bed with her toy- boy Rohit(Vir Das)- an opportunistic chap who dreams to make it big in Bollywood using her money power.Shimmering with rustic appeal, Revolver Rani regales with its notoriously built characters- who are like scorpions trying to sting each other and their fragile alliances.Its all about guns and goons where Alka's softer instincts and her dreams to build a home in Behnice(read Venice) with Rohit rarely find a place.The plot derives the sly humor from some interesting elements,viz,the exploitation of Alka's beau in the fame of politics or the repeated banters of Uday's siblings who are always scheming to kill the uncrowned queen of the ravines. Kabir's direction is largely experimental ,signifactly endorsing to Anurag Kashyap and Tigmanshu Dhulia school of cinema.With an edgy narration, he tries to showcase the extreme dimensions of Alka's character- ranging from her impulsiveness to her craze for phasion(fashion)-fun and gun to her vulnerability.While some sequences are over-stretched with redundant dreamy songs , they are compensated with genuine comic moments.A hyperactive TV reporter's speech and a series of ostensibly orchestrated attempts that follow to cover up Alka's low-key nuptial ceremony with Rohit before the media do make up for a hearty laughter.Kangana reins in her Rani avatar with full gusto.Vir Das is getting typecast with every role as a coc-snorting disillusioned wannabe.Piyush Mishra is superbly authentic as the dubious Mama.Zakir Hussain impresses as the conniving politician of the rival party and he is perfectly aided by the testosterone-charged Kumud Mishra. Overall, its an apt star-cast which lends meaty performances." 
" Ranaut Rani Rules Again","Reviewed by: Dare Devil KidRating: 3.5/5 stars (0.5 stars solely for Kangana Ranaut's stupendous performance)Revolver Rani" is Kangana Ranaut all the way, from first frame till last. After her career-defining turnover in the highly acclaimed "Queen", she follows it up with an equally succulent performance in a film, which though not as brilliant as "Queen" is still decently entertaining fare. Without taking away anything from the Director - Sai Kabir does fashion a good film that captures the murky politics and rustic climes of Central India - it is Kangana's performance that elevates this crime- comedy, eventually making it punch much above its weight.Though Sai Kabir, writes and directs a well-planned script - paying lavish homage to Tarantino (clearly his idol), Kashyap (clearly another inspiration), and Dhulia (yet another inspiration but also his mentor and producer) - he keeps losing his grip over proceedings and at times the homages do appear to deviate from the narrative at hand. However, just when there appears to be a dip in the story arc, Ranaut comes along and holds things together with her theatrics, histrionics, nuanced emotions, brash dialogues, and delightfully mouthed expletives. Make no mistake, Kabir does weave an engaging political yarn with loads of dark humor, but unfortunately doesn't manage to maintain a lucid flow throughout. Perhaps, he'll get better with experience - this is after all his debut feature. The cinematography paints an earthy canvas of the rustic interiors of the country, the editing is moderately passable, the background score could have been way better, and the songs are nothing to write home about.Providing terrific support to Kangana are the reliable as ever Piyush Mishra (one of his best performances yet) and Zakir Hussain. Sadly, for the first time, Vir Das underperforms, and it could just be that he was terribly miscast in the roles of a scheming romantic hero. Zeishan Quadri is grossly underutilized in a poorly written role. "Revolver Rani" serves up a treat for fans of Kangana Ranaut, while also catering to patrons of crime movies and those who enjoy dark comedies. Bollywood finally has another top class actress besides Vidya Balan to bank on in today's times - one who can be relied upon delivering a strong performance consistently along with oozing star power in her roles." 
" Bullet ridden or bullet holed?","am a big fan of Tarantino and have seen his masterpieces several times. At times continuously as if on a spool. So when someone pays homage to him and his style I do take notice and thus become more critical.RR's venae cava is full of QT's nuances right from the nonsensical repetition of the triangular dialogues between the sanki villain brothers.Started off in a slow pace and the time spent on the villains wasn't justified. But nevertheless the moment Alka appears she takes the screen and radiates on every inch of it. Everyone else pales in comparison specially VD. Wish there was some more meteoric element to the story to take it a bit more than the obvious and yes right till the end where Alka opens her eyes a la the bride in kill bill.if 2013 was the year of DP, then 2014 seems to be the year of KR. And I fervently hope so.The songs though nice comes in slightly as a requisite of a Bollywood film rather than as a fabric of the script. The character though etched for Alka, doesn't do justice to the other players on the stage. Is it because the director is fresh? We know a lot of care and passion goes behind making of a movie but sometimes it's good to see it from outside of the box and not just from the frame in the camera to see if one if is really paying the tribute in the rightful manner" 
" Completely fresh, Kangana is by far the super queen of bollywood","This is my first review here and am compelled to write one because of a lot of shitty ones floating around. This movie is by far kangana's best work till date. Rarely dies one see such boldness and aggression in a bollywood actor, so much so that no past references come to mind. Kangana has completely broken the mould and come out with something innately local. The film itself has moved past many stereotypes like a woman playing the savior to her lover with such machismo. Piyush mishra, as the machiavellian balli mama is great too.But the film truly belongs to Kangana. This girl, is leaps and bounds ahead of any other Indian actress in recent times" 
" A fresh Tarantinoesque attempt but could have been much better","Indians love slapstick humor but seldom appreciate dark comedy humor though things are changing with a certain segment accepting films like "1:40 Ki last local", "Go Goa Gone", "Shor", "Ishqiya" series (& the few others made recently).Debutante director Saikabir's Revolver Rani is an unapologetic creatively outlandish, pulp-fiction meets political satire that provides doses of Tamasha. The dark setting, the straight face yet wacky humor in an otherwise intentional loud scenario, witty lines, eccentric music (a masterstroke by new music director Sanjeev Srivastava), crookedly weird verbose villains, unpredictable characters â it is a rightful tribute to the one & only QT. (There's also tribute to Robert Rodriquez â the initial credit & the metallic bra is homage to Machete. There's also a tribute to Scarface in the climax scene).When was the last time you saw a black comedy based on a shocking female protagonist (that also the leader of a political party) who is neurotic, psychotic, egoist, wicked & even a nymphomaniac. When was the last time you saw a Hindi film where the hero is the toy-boy of the female protagonist. Add on to it there are dozens of eccentric characters like the calculative sex-maniac mama, MJ (who resembles the iconic pop-star) & three weird political personalities. There's a news reporter who uses random Shayeri to describe the situations & she is bound to bring the house down with "Sim Sim pore pore" thing.Spoilers -The brutally twisted climax was handled deftly which was kind of cursor to Kill Bill. If a 2nd part is made I hope Rani takes brutal revenge like the Bride & please no more emotions, softness...Spoiler EndLike Go Goa Gone (of 2013) this was a fresh attempt in Hindi cinema But RR got diluted by the emotional element in the stretched second half. Though needed to inflict conflict, the director outdid the sentiment part while the dark, wacky humor got relegated to backstage. It seemed like the producer had forced the director to add sentimental elements to suit the sensibility of a wider audience.Kabir has a flair for Hollywood films & knows his art â the use of minimalist light, apt background music, frames depicting layers, one hope he remains consistent next time. Without lifting scenes he took cues from Kill Bill and suitably changed it for Indian sensibilities. He knows the violent region of Chambal and the brutal game of politics prevalent thus instilling realistic flavor to the eccentric proceedings.He got ample support from other departments. Debutant Sanjeev Srivastava rocks the show with his inspired background music which had retro beats strategically mixed with rock to portray the pulse of the characters. The use of 90s songs used effectively and the use of the siren sound from Kill Bill was a masterstroke. The songs were nice but it hampered the screenplay in the second half.Suhas Gujrati's camera deserves a special mention who lends voice to each of his frames.With revolver Rani, Kangana stamped that she is miles ahead of her contemporaries as Alka Singh aka Rani isn't an easy character to portray which she dared to do & how. Personally I loved her more in this film than Queen (She was superb there too) but when compared Queen had a softer tone which is generally liked by a larger segment. Another strong point - Supporting actors like Kumud Sharma, Zakir Hussein, Vir das, Zeeshan Qadri (definite from GOW).. And obviously, the ever talented & extremely choosy Piyush Mishra sir (as Mama). (By the way those who loves his voice, he also sung two songs in the film).Overall, those who are new to the genre can give it a try. It's like tasting alcohol for the first time, the initial gulp would be heavy & shocking but gradually one either gets use to it or rejects it completely. For the "avid" drinkers like me who enjoys Tarantino (& likes) the film has a rocking 1st half and a superb climax. The initial 45 minutes of the second half diluted the otherwise decent attempt.P.S: At societal level, let all the unwanted girl child of India turns a rebel like Rani & beat the sh*t out of men in this regressive patriarchal society..." 
" Kill Bill Indian Style? Well almost!","The backdrop of Chambal, the famous (or notorious) wastelands of India has been the origin of several romantic stories. Of rebels and outlaws. An Indian version of wild wild west if I may say so. This installment comes with a bit of freshness. The leading lady runs an empire for herself. Kangana plays Alka aka. Revolver Rani, who rules her herd at gunpoint with seemingly insane lack of fear or concern for any consequences and with an irresistible urge to defy everyone to prove her mettle. Comic yet scary at times. Until she discovers that she has been made pregnant by her otherwise parasitic boyfriend (played by Vir Das). All her attention turns to the unborn child and the movie starts taking surprising and not so surprising turns. In a tale of power, seduction, love, conspiracy and treachery, the uncrowned queen of the wastelands finally finds herself riddled with burns and bullets; but she defies death only to wake up at an unknown location as the movie ends. Well a tale of revenge must follow and we will wait for that! We did for Kill Bill. Didn't we?The strength of the movie is Kangana. The National Award winning actress has delivered a solid performance throughout and proved with ease how she can handle such a character which demanded acting skills and physical fitness alike. The energy she pumps in doing every bit of the movie is simply amazing. Piyush Mishra, a fine actor himself gives a powerful performance as the uncle Balli who mentors Alka and yet finally holds his own scheme of things higher than anything else.The dialogs and lyrics are good, script and story telling is not remarkable but able to etch certain characters pretty well. Music is neither a weakness nor a strength. The editor has done a good job and overall the direction by Sai Kabir is commendable. Certainly an enjoyable watch and even in the end leaves you wondering what happens next. 7/10." 
" Unique but falls short","A women gangster has been seen before but Revolver Rani is sort of different as it shows women who shoots people however far fetched it may seem The film is set in Chambel,where all swear by the gun, the film starts well, Alka(Kangana)'s relationship with Vir Das is well handled, so are the twists and turns however things do get repetitive, afterall many films on politics have recently hit the screen lately, even the villains become carricatured and things get boring The end is too far fetched and though there's scope for sequel in the end but yet the end could be betterDirection is decent Music is okay Kangana Ranaut is superb in her role yet again after Queen however the role could be better Vir Das is superb in his role,Zakir Hussain is superb, Piyush Mishra is superb as usual, Kumud Mishra is great and others are good too" 
" 'Revolver Rani' though breaks the mould of 'Rani' (Queen) but this remains dark like its genre, a dark comedyÂ","Read this review at http://moviereviewsbybinduc.blogspot.in/2014/05/revolver-rani.htmlThe Plot: Revolver Rani - a satirical and unusual love story set up in the backdrop of politics. The female protagonist of the movie is Alka Singh Aka Revolver Rani (essayed by Kangana Ranaut), who is part of the hostile territory of Chambal, the land of rebels, dacoits, politicians, bullets and blood. Only fragile alliances and deadly enemies are there and Alka often is the target. For Alka, there are no friends, she can't trust anyone. This movie is about Alka, the eponymous heroine in the film, aggressive, though at times emotionally vulnerable, her bold political stint and even trying to win love with power. Various issues viz. the political games / manipulations / rivalries, the battle for power, corrupt politicians who use people's money to build their palatial houses etc. are also highlighted. Alka loses election to Udaybhan Tomar (Zakir Hussain) in Gwalior. Her sole agenda now is to expose Udaybhan in front of the public and emerge victorious. And on the other side, Udaybhan and his people just want to finish her off. To break Alka, Tomar gang kidnaps her romantic interest Rohan Kapoor (Vir Das), a wannabe Bollywood actor, Alka like a true Revolver Rani saves Rohan amidst gunshots. She also succeeds in her attempt to expose Udaybhan to the world, but then her priorities in lives change. Alka is an interesting character in the movie. She is in need of love in her life. She flashes her metallic bustiers imported from Venice, wears outlandish Turkish pants, jackets, dark glasses, frizzy hairdo. Tanned complexion is given to her. Rohan calls her Coco and his logic for this is that she is hard from outside, but soft inside. And Rani calls him back Chamcham (no logics).Balli Mama (Piyush Mishra), Alka's uncle and principal adviser plays a pivotal role in her life. Balli Mama takes major decisions on her behalf.Newsreader Payal (Mishika Singh) takes a dig at the manipulations, exaggerations, misinterpretation of the facts which have become a part of journalism currently. Her news-piece Sagat Samachar highlights the trivial things also as breaking news. At times, her script has film lyrics as well.What happens between Alka and Rohan? Does their love blossom ? What role Balli Mama play in her life ? What happens to the animosity between Tomar Gang and Revolver Rani ? Who emerges winner (or rather strong)? How does the political scenario shape up? Who takes whose sides? Does Alka's people remain faithful to her during her tough times? Do Tomar gang pay for their political corruptions / manipulations? The movie definitely answers these questions.Director / Story / Screenplay: Sai Kabir Shrivastava has definitely been able to give a dark comedy to Bollywood. He has broken the mould with a fierce Revolver Rani who is at par with any male gun- toting political counterpart. Cast and their Performance: Kangana Ranaut as Revolver Rani aka Alka has definitely given an excellent performance. This role is a complete turnaround to her role in Queen. Vir as Rohan Kapoor and a wannabe Bollywood actor, does not have much dialogues in the movie. He just has to react or surrender to the situations helplessly. As per the script, he is successful in projecting his character. Piyush Mishra as Balli Mama of Alka and Zakir Hussain as Udaybhan Tomar have given noteworthy performances.Music: Music is composed Sanjeev Srivastava. Lyrics are by Shaheen Iqbal and Puneet Sharma. Music is just average. Asha Bhosle has given voice to 'Kaafi Nahi Chand', Usha Uthup has sung the title song 'Revolver Rani'.Moments to watch out for This movie is absolutely not my preference, but if without getting biased, if I say, then Kangana Ranaut's moves are noteworthy. Thumbs up: Only and only Kangana Ranaut. Watch this movie if you love dark comedy. Thumbs down: Please don't watch this movie, if you want some real humour. You may not enjoy the gun shots and the political gameplay.One-Liner: 'Revolver Rani' though breaks the mould of 'Rani' (Queen) but this remains dark like its genre, a dark comedyÂ" 
" Kangana Ranaut","INTRO : Its a mad, mad world out there. Politicians rallying around with guns and bullets is how Sai Kabir's Revolver Rani begins. The film is a black comedy with some great dialogue delivery by Kangana Ranaut.PLOT : The beginning of the films is stretched too long which might leave you a little tedious but hold on till Kangana Ranaut comes to save her lover with guns blazing. She wants to expose the dirty politics the ruling party played to bring their party to power and removed her from her "Kursi". Things happen and suddenly her priority changes effecting her and people around her. A subplot in the 2nd half was not required stretching the film again but the climax is very impressive.PERFROMANCE : Kangana Ranaut steals the show with her amazing performance, she leads and leads from the front. Her acting and comic timing is excellent, so is her undying spirit in the film. Piyush Mishra is very impressive so was Zakir Hussain. Vir Das was OK. Direction is good but writing is not.VERDICT : Watch it for a great performance by Kangana Ranaut but don't expect much from the movie itself.P.S : Hold on to your seats till the end as their is an eye waiting to open." 
" Super Awesome on the whole","This is really good cinema,not like most of the movies releasing today without anything creative in them,literally. Kangana and the full cast and above all the music is super awesome. This is one of a kind movie in Indian cinema as first half is filled up with dark humour and the second one is very dramatic with mind blowing twists. Direction is brilliant,music direction is the best this year,without any doubt. Starting of the movie is slightly slow,but the entry of KR speedily commences the proceedings further.Couple of scenes could have been shortened a bit,but still those ones are also worth watching on the whole.If you like to watch a really different treatment given to an Indian movie,go for this one."
