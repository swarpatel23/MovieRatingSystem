" Dated, Dumb Bollywood Camp","Gosh, I thought that they had buried movies about the 'battle of the sexes' and 'swashbuckling stunt-men' way back in the 20th Century. And yet, here it is, all exhumed, reanimated and outfitted with Hollywood names the likes of Sly Stallone, Denise Richards and Brandon Routh - and called 'Kambakkht Ishq'. The title is derived from the popular number, 'Kambakkht Ishq' from Ram Gopal Varma's film, 'Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya'.Directed by Sabbir Khan, 'Kambakkht Ishq' is loud, crude, clich√©d, campy and utterly predictable. And if you are curious about the (advertised) roles of its Hollywood supporting stars, let's say that their parts are so cheesy, you can open a pastry shop with them. Imagine a geriatric Stallone reprising his Rambo role and you will know what I mean.The movie is a remake of the 2002 Tamil film 'Pammal K. Sambandam'. It is about a 'super' Indian stuntman in Hollywood (Akshay Kumar as Viraj Shergill) who meets an Indian supermodel (Kareena Kapoor as Simrita Rai) at his brother's (Aftab Shivdasani as Lucky) wedding in church. Both the leads are unhappy about the marriage of Lucky and Simrita's sister Kamini (Amrita Arora) and the battle lines are drawn at the wedding reception where we see the movie's most dazzlingly choreographed number that ends in a tasteless and farcical brawl.Yeah, Viraj and Simrita hate each other. In Bollywood terms, it means they are gonna do lots of idiotic things before they finally realise that they love each other right from the get-go.The first half is more tolerable than the second. Sabbir Khan loads the first hour with action-packed stunt sequences and dance numbers that take us from Hollywood to Italy. Then he has to take such a long time to render the outcome of the 'battle of the sexes' plot which everyone in the audience already knows. And if that is not bad enough, Sabbir Khan also does recaps of his scenes - in case we missed them or forget them! The director also could not resist crude 'American Pie' gags like having the protagonist fart in the face of a bride, having the heroine curse like a sailor; and going over-the-top with an 'anal search' scene. Character development is minimal, and the cast are unimpressive, with the age-old device of having the 'hero' supported by a clownish aide (in the form of Vindu Dara Singh). And whose idea was it to have Viraj undergo open abdomen surgery without anaesthesia? Of the stars, Kareena shines brightest in a badly-written role. She is the most watchable but alas, not quite enough good to stop this "Dumbakkht" from sinking." 
" Nothing Special - A Cheap Movie","Kambakkht Ishq is a very cheap comedy. Akshay Kumar once again fails to prove and bring new in himself. For me, this movie is nothing. Just bores you. Total waste of time and money. Very cheap comedy throughout the movie and the story says Kambakkht Ishq = SEX. I was expecting Akshay will prove himself. The only thing I found worth was Kareena Kapoor's body which director has focused very much. Anu Mallik's music is totally disappointing. Doesn't entertain you any moment. The film has no story, revolves around just one aspect sex and affairs. So, to take my word don't go for this movie. Instead sit in your home and hire some great DVDs and watch them. The film is not worth watching. Let god save Akshay..." 
" How dumb do they think we are ?","I honestly truly believe that this movie is the worst movie I have seen in years. I hold a great respect for Indian cinema and I have been in love with Bollywood since before I could even walk my first step.The thing about this movie is that it is ridiculously illogical in every single aspect, not to mention the lead actors serious problem of over-acting. I loved Kareena in 'Jab we met' and I thought "well this girl finally proved that she can indeed act normally", but this movie changed my mind.To be fair though, I did laugh at times. Not because the scenes were funny, but because they were sooooo stupid that I just couldn't help myself." 
" A weak show...","'Kambakkht Ishq' has been in the buzz for a long,long time. The film has been awaited... why? Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor are the lead actors, the film is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala and has 3 Hollywood Supertstars, Stallone, Routh and Denise Richards. But with all these trumps does this flick entertain? The answer is NO!The problem with Kambakkht Ishq is that it's a senseless film. The film hardly has a script, Debutant Director Sabbir Khan makes a disappointing fare. The first hr of the film is yet passable, but the second is just unbearable. The film has 'A' class production value, but script wise, its a complete disappointment.Pluses of the film: Sajid Nadiadwala is a classy producer, he has left no stone unturned to make this flick. Akshay, Kareena, Stallone, Routh & Denise Richards are the pluses as well. Akshay is in form once again, but he's again done a film that throws even the least amount of logic into the trash bin. Kareena looks great and delivers a good performance. Stallone, Routh, Denise are perfect in cameos. Stallone's action scene, where he bashes up the goons will be will loved by one and all. Aftab & Amrita do their parts perfectly. Vindhu Singh is just right.Minuses: Sabbir Khan's direction and screenplay. Anu Malik's music is mediocre. Talented actors like Kirron Khan and Jaaved Jaffery are wasted in apologetic roles. Those 5 stars are in order -- 1 for Sajid Nadiadwala's high class production, 1 for Akki, 1 for Kareena, 1 for Stallone, and 1 is shared by Denise and Routh. To sum up the review, 'Kambakkht Ishq' is a letdown." 
" Extremely silly but still enjoyable","Don't go expecting a great movie, it's not.But it is also not "the worst of the worst" etc. It is uneven. There are jokes that might appeal to a 13 year old that are dreadfully stale and in poor taste for adults. The scriptwriter's sense of how a person becomes a doctor in the US is bizarre. I don't know if this matches Indian practice in some way but it certainly doesn't represent even a nodding acquaintance with the American hospital scene.The situations and language will not shock anyone used to US films, though they are probably fairly shocking for Bollywood, and I do not know to what extent the subtitles represented a taming of the language in Hindi. Someone complained about nudity--I don't count presumed nudity under sheets as nudity.That said, there are some nice moments, and a great sense of energy throughout. If you have high tolerance for silliness, this is fun. My husband who is not a Bollywood fan, enjoyed it." 
" Dumb... dumber.... dumbest","This movie is a strong no-no for any movie lover, even for die hard fans of Akshay or Kareena. Reasons... read below. Story: This movie is about a dog and a bitch, who cannot say filthy words on-screen because of censorship. So they go out hurling abuse on the opposite sex without any justification. The audience is dumbstruck on their own foolishness to spend 150 bucks and more so 140 minutes on the 'datum of the datums' movie. Direction: Now they know, every asst director cannot and should not become a director. Even a stunt man could have done a better job on KI. Guest Appearances: Neither Nadiadwala nor Sabbir has a degree in management. Else they would know that you cannot offer a product whose functionality is unknown to the customer. Stallone is OK, but how many Indians know Routh or Dennise Richards, probably less than 0.5%. Why waste so much money on big Hollywood starts who cannot translate it into revenues?? Acting: Akshay is the least exploited actor in last few years. He has such great acting potential last seen in Hera Pheri and Namaste London. But since then, he has done some of the worst movies of his career. KI is just an addition to the list. Kareena is the biggest letdown of the decade. No point hailing her as a superstar, we all know how her acting has deteriorated over the years. Her acting in Refugee, Asoka and Chameli showed such great promise. But its all gone now. In KI, she not only acts poorly but also looks ugly. Sorry to say, she looks like a transsexual in her zero figure. Instead of Kareena, they should have gone for any voluptuous babe with sexy figure like Bipasha, Shilpa or even Deepika. Aaftab and Amrita has gone down from supporting actors to side kicks to now kicked in the corner. And what the hell are Boman Irani and Javed Jaffery doing in here?? This movie is not meant for them. Music: This could have been the saving grace for this dumb movie, just like Singh is king. But alas, music is more pathetic than the movie itself. I don't remember even one nice song to hum. Once again, a complete disaster." 
" do not watch movie Kambakkht Ishq","please, do not watch movie Kambakkht Ishq .....Kambakht Ishq is an illogical flickits just cheap n head paining. its not just vulgar, but a high make-up of overacting.....just few stunts are good..... i must say there r no real stunts rather.... no good.........there is nothing entertaining or logical in movie.....the actor did the job, as expected, nothing extra-ordinary.as usual actress has its over-acting on.... and this time it was head paining i hate actress more after watching movie....and characters.......Javed Jaffrey did his part well, but i must say, movie is getting on community(he belongs in movie), in a wrong way. That is totally, not at all appreciating :(Don't waste your time and money by watching this movie, please.... :)Its just Non-Sense movie........." 
" Utter Rubbish and Wate of Time and Money","Well, this movie does not deserve any comment. But i had to warn people if they read this before going to watch this movie.. Its not the money that i fear, will be wasted. But it is more the time and intellect that might be hurt. After the movie started, my misery also started. I had no idea what i watching. Anyways, now to the movie. The movie is neither a comedy, nor a romantic one. It falls short on all grounds. The worse part, there is no story. Just a guy who wants to impress a girl, the girl who resists men and their love. Then the whole movie rounds about the same theme with cheap jokes, stupid dialogues and worst acting from really good actors..I just pity Akshay ... who has lost it... completely. Poor Guy. this flop will three in a line." 
" Lower your expectation and presto - its total time-pass!","Well, with the media taking its toll on Kambakkht Ishq & Akshay Kumar - the expectations runs low and the movie turns out better than expected. Akshay Kumar must be kicking himself not having exercised caution (read that "choose wisely") when he was just between the cup-and-the-lip. Lightning doesn't strike twice my dear friend.Anyways, the love-you & loathe you sequences start from the word go and until it reaches finale there is a fair share of story interlaced with emotion, drama, comedy, tragedy etc. Having said that, there was immense potential to improvise - but hey, who am I to say!¬§ Akshay Kumar:: Much before he struck gold I always carried an opinion that give him a nickel and Akshay delivers in dimes. Post success streak that became his style. And now - I am back to my original opinion.¬§ Kareena:: The "Poo" character return (albeit in size zero!).¬§ Javed Jaffery:: Seriously, what was he doing there?¬§ Aftab & Amrita:: Glorified junior-artistes. Reminds me of Rajendranath/ Shobha Khote of 60's.¬§ Vindu:: Good to see after a long hiatus. And trying a hand at comedy, eh?¬§ Boman Irani & Kiron Kher:: Under-utilisation at its best. Seriously - is money everything? ¬§ Hollywood star-cast:: Beyond my comprehension as to why they were there in the first place. Too much of money to flaunt around I guess. The plot could have easily been based in India.¬§ Sabir Khan:: Obviously, the master doesn't teach everything to the disciple (ref. Mujhse Shaadi Karogi!)¬§ Nadiadwala:: Time to pull up your socks and ensure quality goods are delivered under your baton.Finally, the movie is completely inspired (should I abstain from the word plagiarised?) by Pammal K. Sambandam. Had the project been executed legally involving the great thespian to overlook the proceedings - the results would have been far more superior. On that same note, yesterday I read the producers of Namaste London suing the Bengali filmmaker for copyright infringement. Hello Mr. Akshay Kumar... pot calling the kettle black eh?" 
" please, don't see this piece of rubbish","i don't know why BOLLYWOOD let this movie come out?? it's just a waste of time. that's the first time that i see a Indian movie with this crappy things. that'ts not a comedy, but it's a disgusting movie without any sense of cinema.if you have seen this movie, please forget it, because It's a shame for Indian movie. and of course, no one can say it's a good movie, because all the world know how bad it is.so i think that AKSHAY KUMAR has to say good bye to comedy because he can't do it, he is is good in drama and action, but in comedy he is just a bad actor. for KAREENA KAPOOR really i respect this actress, but in this movie, she think that's is the most hotter girl in the world, sorry KAREENA but really you don't deserve 2 hours of our time safe your time and you money! and don't see this piece of rubbish" 
" Man Vs. Woman Theme Simply Makes It Not Worth Your While","Kambakkht Ishq a.k.a Damned Love is a Bollywood romantic comedy that features Akshay Kumar and Kareen Kapoor together with Hollywood actors and actresses such as superstar Sylvester Stallone,Denise Richards,Holly Valance and Brandon Routh who appear in cameos.It was based on another Bollywood film entitled Pammal K. Sambandam that tells the story of Hollywood stuntman Viraj Shergill and medical student Simrita Rai,who came across each other in a wedding ceremony and have developed a dislike for each other due to their own low opinion of the opposite sex.In other words,it brought back old themes particularly that about a man being better than the woman and vice-versa as well as the opposite sex trying to upstage one another.With the man vs woman theme,the film fails miserably.But the list of negative things about the movie does not end there.It also has a poor screenplay as shown by the poorly written dialogues and uninteresting characters.Obviously,a stuntman falling in love with a medical student seems far fetch especially when both have a certain dislike for the opposite sex and empathy from the viewer is far- fetched due to their superiority complex.Added to that,the comedic scenes does not provide any laughter as they fall flat and they are mostly crude and racy.Added to that,the pacing is far from being constant that some parts are just simply too long and boring that one may even want the movie to end sooner than expected.Its 2 hour and 13 minute length was just too much especially for a clich√©d and predictable movie.The appearance of the Hollywood stars does not increase interest in the film as they are totally wasted and at worst not necessary at all. Overall,there is no wonder why this film is lowly rated by the critics and did not do well in the box office when it was theatrically released." 
" Kambakkht Ishq","Let me start saying what i liked in the movie, the song - Om Mangalam - (Reprised) Kambakkht Ishq and the extras behind Kareena Kapoor (Bebo) and Akshay Kumar in every song.Akshay Kumar previous movie Singh is King is much better than this movie. Akshay Kumar please get back to the Khiladi mode or get into the mode the reel son of Amithabh Bachchan.Kareena Kapoor is way toooo loud in the movie, i do not know was it for emphasis or was the acoustics in the new theater. At the same time, if you want to see whats "in" fashion, you need to check out the outfits that Kareena Kapoor is wearing. If the clothes were any shorter, then this movie would have been given a "A" grade certification. Talking about the much hyped swimsuit sequence of Kareena Kapoor, yeah, swimsuit was good, but it was not that great on her.From the Hollywood brigade there is Sylvester Stallone, Denise Richards, Branden Routh, i think all of them are wasted to some extent, they should have be given some more meaty role. Starting with Brenden, Akshay is his body double, the first action sequence is the only one that might be original. Then, there is Stallone who has just his presence Then there are these action sequences that are have used the sets of Beverly Hills Cop III starring Eddie Murphy and Waterworld starring Kevin Costner.If we want to watch the swimsuit models, i will still prefer going back to watching Baywatch, but a whole, movie where all of the extras wearing swimsuits. Someone must be having a very hard time to choose two different swimsuits, which cannot repeated in very scene. That would be the worlds best and worst job to do, specially if you are suffering from amnesia.Aftab Shivdasani, Amrita Arora get overshadowed with loudness of Akshay and Kareena. Javed Jaffey is also there in the movie as a Sindhi Mr. Keswani, was hoping that he might save the day with another act like Crocodile Dundee in Salaam Namaste. Like most of the scenes end very abruptly.If this an entry of Hollywood stars in Bollywood movies then for a fact then we can surely see a trend of Johnny Depp fighting a battle with Aamir Khan, then Depp loosing the battle, Megan Fox and Frieda Pinto setting a ramp walk on fire, then Frieda taking the crown away. Or the movie producers will make two version of movies, one for the Indian audience where the Indian actor wins and the other one for the global audience where the Hollywood actor wins, that would be ultimate movie customization, based on bias." 
" Horrible...simply horrible!","I give it a 1 on the scale of 10. If IMDb had negative ratings, I would have chosen -10. It is a typical bollywood crap of a movie showing how desperate bollywood directors, producers and actors are that they would do just about anything to associate themselves with Hollywood. What they don't realize is that there should be a good storyline, good acting skills and some class that would result in making the movie a hit. Just by having Hollywood actors act in a few scenes would not make a horrible movie any better. I heard this happens to be one of the most expensive bollywood productions. I'm sure it would have taken a lot of money to convince Hollywood actors to star in the film. I'd rather watch Hollywood actors in a Hollywood movie rather than in a bollywood movie.The stunts were unimpressive and not really required. I know Akshay was playing a stuntman but there was no need to have all the expensive sets and stunts in the movie, stunts on a smaller scale would have done the job. The story as I mentioned earlier was a waste and the acting just made me feel agitated. I couldn't help rolling my eyes through out. By the way, I couldn't wait for the movie to finish to write my comments here. For people who are into cheap, low class comedy or who are big Akshay and Kareena fans might like this a lot. For me, it was a waste of time. I wonder what all the good Indians actors and directors are doing these days. Maybe making money in buying cricket teams. Oh and the character of Kareena comes from greys anatomy's Izzie Stevens character, a girl from a middle class family trying to make money from a little modelling prior to getting into med school in an attempt to fulfil her dream of becoming a doctor. Unlike Kareena, she wasn't all dolled up and expensively dressed. I think they've shot scenes in the same hospital set grey's anatomy is shot in.One last thing, the real English translation of 'kambakht' is not 'incredible', it's 'pathetic' and thats exactly what this movie is...simply kambakht." 
" Kambakkht Movie","The review I had read before the release gave it a 3.5 stars stating that it was a solid entertainer, brilliant, hilarious comedy, and if not always laughing, but it'll always have you smiling, at all times. I've been through worse, so I sat through it. And, for once, HYPE didn't kill this movie. This movie was dead before it hit the screens.Akshay Kumar with his stupid stunts, worse-than-ever performance at some points, irritating clich√© expressions is the most destructive factor of the movie. He did it in Chandni Chowk, then in Tasveer, and now Kambakkht Ishq. The direction is so stupid and abrupt, you just wonder why did they show this scene? What was the point of that line he said? The cinematography and editing was good, and so were three of the songs. The script was bad, and seriously, it was bad. And the only thing about the movie which I liked was, well, Bebo.How the hell did a superstar like Sylvester Stallone wind up in the middle of a gang-way alley to save Bebo from gangsters? Yes, Sylvester Stallone is himself in the movie. How can a superstar of his fame arrive there, JUST at the time required?? Age-old-traditional bollywood rigidity, one that shall never change, I guess.Time's up Akki. Time up. 4/10, ONLY for Bebo and the songs." 
" Funny, glamorous and predictable","I expected nothing much out of KI because I think Akshay Kumar is an overrated comedy actor and Kareena kapoor is the queen of overacting. Therefore when the movie started and turned into a comedy riot I was pleased. Credit goes to Akshay Kumar for being yet again the same brat he has been in Hera Pheri, or Bhagam Bhag. The only difference is that he is speaking in English and resides in Hollywood. Kareena Kapoor is unbelievable as a surgeon. My sister is a surgeon, and believe you me, no one at age 25 or whatever she portrays becomes a) a surgeon, b) has time to model in Milan WHILST their surgery programme is running and finally c) has nails as long as fairy tale witches (surgeons cannot have long nails... period) However she doesn't have much to do but lok hot, and she does. Finally I would say go for the first half of the movie, its a laughing riot, very funny, some over the top scenes but then again its Akshay Kumar comedy. On the whole very glamorous, great locations, clothes and people but a very predictable story. If there could have been any improvement it should have been in Kareena Kapoors acting." 
" Worst Movie I Have Ever Watched!","This movie is awful, just about everything in the move is bad. If you are a normal human being & never been to any mental asylum this movie might make you puke. Whats sad is that this movie stars Stallone & Denise Richards, so many non-Indians might watch it for them and make a wrong assumption about Indian movies. To all them I must say, this is not what a Indian movie is. This is not even a film, its just a caricature to make money pleasing the uneducated sex-starved class. This ones doesn't have any story, acting is terrible. The leading lady Kareena Kapoor has a song where she is seducing a man & is fully clothed, but her dance moves & hand gestures are so vulgar that you will feel ashamed. The film is a misogynist film, showing women in poor light. The Hollywood talent are wasted & made fun of. Avoid is if you love yourself."
