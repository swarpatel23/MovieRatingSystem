" Disappointing","Just saw this movie.I must say Bheja Fry 2,a sequel to Bheja Fry is disappointing.Direction by Sagar Ballary is bad.The story is okay.The screenplay is badly written.The comedy scenes are just few.The music is bad.Performances-Vinay Pathak is the star of the show.He simply rocks!Kay Kay Menon is efficient.Suresh Menon is excellent.Amole Gupte this time is bad.Minnisha Lamba looks beautiful,acts okay.Aditi Govitrikar and Rukhsaar are wasted.Rest are okay.On the whole Bheja Fry 2 is a disappointment." 
" A Big Let Down","Considering how popular this movie was, I was surprised to see no review. So I decided to write one. Here it goes, Don't even think of comparing it to the first one, because this is way worse. The movie desperately tries to be funny, but ultimately falls flat. It is Bheja fry for the audience, because Bharat Bhushan ends up getting really irritating for K.K. Menon, but more for the audience. I don't blame Vinay Pathak. In fact, acting overall was superb and that is the only reason, the movie is watchable and humorous, because the jokes are simply bad. Ultimately, I would advise you to go for it only if you are a Vinay Pathak fan. The comedy is not worth it." 
" a shadow of the past","After watching Bheja fry 1 I had high expectations for the sequel.Although it was a copy of a French movie,still it was a good one.However Bheja Fry 2 is a downer .Be prepared to douse your expectations in cold water.Firstly,its not exactly funny in the stricter sense of the term,may be once or twice it did bring a laugh or two.Otherwise its content may keep you mildly interested for a while.On the acting front Vinay Pathak is great as the bumbling,good hearted tax inspector.He is the only silver lining to this lackluster venture.May a good way to go and watch this movie would be to have very low expectations.You might as well enjoy it a little then.Otherwise don't waste your time and money." 
" The copy worked earlier but the original effort in the sequel fails to impress.","We all remember the innocent fool superbly played by Vinay Pathak in "Bheja Fry". But the film was not an original concept as it was almost scene to scene lifted from the French comedy "Le Diner De Cons or The Dinner Game". Though it had some great performances from its entire cast but still its inspiration seems to be the main reason why the movie worked largely with the audience.This was the first thought which came to my mind as I finished watching its sequel, with a simple reason that I didn't really feel entertained or having enjoyed my two hours spent with the same Vinay Pathak playing the lovable Hindi film songs fan and a Tax Inspector. The present original effort by its director Sagar Ballary comes out to be too timid and dwarf in front of the huge expectations raised by its title. In fact using the same title works against the movie this time as the viewer neither gets to see a little more foolishness in the Hit character of Vinay, nor there are enough entertaining sequences in the movie which can make you laugh or even smile. To be precise, there is nothing in its content justifying its title "Bheja Fry -2" other than the same actor repeating his role of Bharat Bhushan.The film actually fails at many levels. It starts off as a story of a fake businessman Kay Kay and Vinay comes in a bit late and that too without any great gimmick planned by the director. The first half talks more about the business side of the characters and less of Vinay and his innocent foolishness. The entire sequence on the cruise could have been a laugh riot but falls flat in absence of any great comic writing. Post intermission as the focus shifts on Vinay and Kay Kay being left on a lonely island, boredom comes in and the narration becomes rather lengthy & uninteresting. Further the last moment introduction of Amol Gupte also fails to make any kind of impact on the audience.Apart from its weak writing and unexciting direction the script also disappoints with its various characters. First of all the character of Suresh Menon replacing Ranvir Shorey in the original, doesn't work at all and one really misses Ranvir in the film most of the times. Suresh is no doubt good but without any great lines written for him in particular, he remains helpless. Secondly, Minnisha Lamba has nothing to do in the film other than taking care of its glamour part and she totally looks like a misfit. In fact there is not a single hilarious scene featuring Mininisha in the movie. Next, the side track of Kay Kay's troubled married life having Rukhsaar as his wife and Aditi Gowariker as his other interest simply wastes the presence of the ladies. And lastly I really found Amol Gupte playing the eccentric photographer living alone on the island and Virendra Saxena as the Chacha hugely disappointing. However, Vinay Pathak as the famous fool once again delivers a quality performance which sadly doesn't get its much required back-up of an entertaining script. From his side he leaves no stones unturned to make it an enjoyable journey for the viewers. Kay Kay too, as his lonely companion on the island gives a fine performance but he really could have been a lot better with some more great one liners or dialogues. Thinking about the main plot of the movie, I strongly feel that had the director thought of a script revolving around the launch of A New Pop Album of Vinay Pathak by the music company of Kay Kay, then it could have been a different story altogether. But it seems that the writers suddenly forgot this enjoyable track after the first few reels and then simply went on to write on a different plot roaming around a deserted island. Also very surprisingly the song with which film's first look was introduced in the media, "Ishq Da Keeda" can be found no-where in the movie. Plus, another good song "Rahi Rahi" and its music video, is shown along the end credits of the film. And in my opinion that was really an absurd kind of promotional strategy adopted by its makers. In all, Bheja Fry -2 more or less revolves around just Vinay and Kay Kay, which remains the weakest factor of the film. The script fails to involve all the other supporting characters in the script entertainingly and therefore it is not able to have a strong grip over its viewers. You can watch it if you are dying to see Vinay Pathak playing the famous fool once again but don't expect anything equivalent to what you have already seen in its original (but copied) first part. Still it's undoubtedly a decent, clean & subtle comedy, better than many illogical Bazmee or Priyadarshan comic Hits." 
" Good,but not as good as the prequel","Well well well Bharat Bushan(Vinay Pathak)is back,and back with a bang .All of you must have seen the promos and you would have thought that the film is about Bharat Bhushan meeting the girl of his dreams,getting married etc etc...But trust me its not about that .In the movie,Bharat wins 25 lakh rupees and also gets a free stay of 2 nights and three days at a star cruse after winning a certain quiz show .Over there he is misunderstood as an income tax officer by a business tycoon named Ajit Talwar .Hilarity ensues when Ajit Talwar(Kay Kay Menon) tries to put an end to this supposed income tax officer .They get stranded on an island and embark on a small adventure of saving themselves .Now,you must be wondering "where's the chick?".Well,she's just one of the makers of the quiz show and her name is Ranjini(Minissha Lamba).Her role is minimal and quite insignificant .Now,lets get to the performances .Vinay Pathak plays his role splendidly well and deserves all the plaudits which he is sure to receive .However,his role tends to drag and gradually gets boring and very irritating .Kay Kay Menon is very impressive and he this time he's the one who plays the victim of Bharat Bhushan's companionship .Amole Gupte,Minissha Lamba and Suresh Menon have minor but well played roles .Overall,the film is a success .The end is quite touching just like the first movie .Apart from certain drawbacks and flaws I am impressed with the film .7 stars out of 10 from me ." 
" Embarrassing comedy!","This film is not even half as good as its prequel.That was very simple with a few actors only, but was really well made and hilarious. This one is just an embarrassing sequel with silly comedy most of the time and unwanted women.The story is about the protagonist Bhushan who is a tax officer and this time gets stranded on a remote island with a business tycoon who thinks the tax department is after him, while both are on a cruise.The only good thing are some comedy scenes involving Vinay Pathak.Everything else is bogus and cheap...poor comedy, overacting, and even a weak storyline.You can miss this one....no big deal!" 
" The heart-conquering simpleton","In my review of Anari, I had asserted that Bollywood's greatest showman, Raj Kapoor was most liked by the Indian audience in the role of the golden-hearted simpleton. Anari, Jaagte Raho, Teesri Kasam, Shri 420, Kanhaiya, Chhaliya, Deewaana; the list movies featuring him as a simpleton is quite long. And he conquered the hearts of the audience for good through them. Still these movies are considered as gold-plated, diamond-studded gems from the treasure of Bollywood cinema.Times have changed. Now neither such quality movies are made in Bollywood, nor we have any Raj Kapoor with us. However, a few years back, one actor arrived on the scene of Indian cinema who is not only a versatile actor but also a perfect fit for the role of a clean-hearted, innocent simpleton. And he is Vinay Pathak. Vinay Pathak has, in fact, re-written some acting lessons through his natural and heart-winning performances.In 2007, director Sagar Ballari presented a movie Bheja Fry featuring Vinay Pathak in the lead role of Mr. Bharat Bhushan, the straightforward (and fortunately for the income-tax payers, non-corrupt) income-tax inspector who's an amateur singer in his personal life and very fond of music. The story which mainly consisted of the witty and laugh-provoking interaction between Bharat Bhushan and the owner of a music company, Ranjeet Thadani (Rajat Kapoor) was a rip off from a french movie - Le Diner De Cons (1998) which means the dinner game. The amusing story which contained less laughters more ticklings, was applauded a lot with Vinay Pathak effortlessly winning the hearts of the audience.Inspired by the success and admiration received by Bheja Fry, Mr. Ballari decided to make its sequel and it has come before the audience in the form of this movie. In this movie, Mr. Ballari, for a change, has not lifted the story from anywhere and used an original script instead. The novelty is that the movie has been shot on a cruise in the first half and on a desolate island in the second. And the change is that except Vinay Pathak, i.e., Mr. Bharat Bhushan, the hero, none of the characters of the prequel has been repeated in the sequel.Actually, both the prequel and the sequel seem to be based on the concept of the collateral with two main characters of the story trying to outwit each other (or being helpful to each other). In the prequel, the clean-hearted income-tax inspector and music lover Bharat Bhushan was up against the oversmart music company owner - Ranjeet Thadani whereas in the sequel, he is crossing path with a cunning, tax-evading, womanizing and high-handed businessman - Ajeet Talwar (Kay Kay Menon). As a prize of winning the Aao Guess Karen contest hosted by a TV channel, he gets a paid holiday trip on a cruise and there he stumbles upon Ajeet Talwar who is already scared of the income-tax officials. In his bid to get rid of Bharat Bhushan by throwing him in the sea, he himself also falls into it alongwith Bharat Bhushan and both these gentlemen reach a desolated island to further interact and try to tickle the funny bone of the viewer. There comes a different track of Raghu Burman (Amol Gupte) too who listens to old songs on his antic radio and keeps on missing his separated sweetheart - Mahua. Bharat Bhushan stumbles upon his uncle (Virendra Saxena) too who has arrived the island to enjoy with a girl (being infidel to Bharat Bhushan's aunt). And the movie goes on aimlessly to fill its time-duration.I have read several reviews of this movie, trying to prove as if the prequel was a masterpiece and the sequel, in comparison to that, is a disaster which is untrue. Neither the prequel was great, nor the sequel is a disaster. Its not at all a disappointment for the die-hard fans of Vinay Pathak who has infused life into the story (if we deem that some story is actually there) of the movie with his innocent mannerisms and he has been ably supported by Kay Kay Menon who is definitely an actor par excellence. The first half is thoroughly gripping and despite the dragging, the second half is also enjoyable at least for a few reels. Had the director reduced the time duration of the movie to around 100 minutes only by removing unnecessary tracks and characters, that shortened movie would have been a better one. It is entertaining, all the same.Technical aspects, except editing, are OK. Background score is also OK. Songs are unnecessary and could have been done away with. It is more or less the show of the collaterals, i.e., Vinay Pathak and Kay Kay Menon who are just outstanding. The supporting actors have done well but there was nothing much to do for them. Characters like Rahul Singh, Rukhsaar and Aditi Govitrikar are no better than junior artists. And that again is the weakness of the director who failed in doing justice to many characters.Still I recommend this movie to not only the fans of Vinay Pathak but also to the viewers who fall into the the category of the audience of clean-comedies. This neat and clean and overall entertaining comedy is manifold better than the crap made by David Dhawan or Anees Bazmee in the name of comedy as well as many over-hyped movies of Priyadarshan." 
" Bheja Fry 2.. The real sequel...","BF2 is a real roller coaster of fun & humor. At one point you are at bottom at end of your patience thinking to skip the sequence and at another on the top with laughing you lungs out. The film drags a bit towards the end especially after Amol Gupte is introduced. Unlike the BF1 the film is not about Bharat Bhushan only. The plot has a lot more and a romantic angle too this time. BF1 was almost entirely relied on urban humor; BF2 with some crude dialog brings in required freshness that makes the sequels stand apart and not a ripoff. With punches like "Who is he? : He is Indian", this comedy is for serious humor enthusiasts." 
" Lukewarm. ♦ 56%","I am disappointed with the sequel, much like I am with other sequels of terrific movies. This is a film which is nowhere near its prequel but is a decent comedy on its own.Vinay Phatak slightly overacts out of his witty, jovial character. Shekhar Menon as his IT officer friend is good, just like Ranvir Shorey in the prequel. But the latter excels. Kay Kay Menon is fantastic as always, but the plot is cringe-worthy and it destroys all their performances. First half is bearable, but second half when is just an example of poor writing & screenplay.Not much to talk about the film factors, Bheja Fry 2 is a one-time watch, if at all you should give it a chance. 5.6 out of 10. A failed sequel.BOTTOM LINE: Bheja Fry was not original but is a classic. Bheja Fry 2 is suicide. Bheja Fry 3 may be better.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity/Sex/Foreplay: No | Nudity/Vulgarity: Very Mild | Violence: Mild | Gore: No | Smoking/Drugs: No | Alcohol: Strong" 
" Puts Your Bheja To Sleep","Alright I have not seen 'Bheja Fry'. Now that's out of the way. 'Bheja Fry 2' is a disappointment. Sagar Ballary's movie is filled with inconsistencies, lack of direction, poor writing and editing and even forced humour in some parts. He should have focused less screen time on the sequences that take place before the businessman and income-tax officer get stranded. The most entertaining parts are the sequences between Kay Kay Menon and Vinay Pathak and this is primarily due to the two actors performances. Pathak has played similar characters in many films. Even in the more recent 'Chalo Dilli', his Manu Gupta has almost exactly the same personality as Bharat Bhushan. Menon is the one who stands out with his spontaneity (especially his reaction to Pathak's Bhushan's antics) and natural charm. They make the island sequence enjoyable up until the point of Amole Gupta's appearance. Gupta's character is out of place and his over-the-top acting only takes the film further down to the point of no redemption. Anyway, if it weren't for Menon and Pathak this would have been an entire waste." 
" Had the potential, but totally loses the plot","A low key 'Bheja Fry' was a runaway hit in 2007 and a lesser known Vinay Pathak was catapulted to comic stardom. Despite the fact that it was lifted straight from a French film, it had the audience laughing their hearts out. Pathak again dons the role of the stupid-irritating- talkative-singer-tax-man Bharat Bhushan in 'Bheja Fry 2'.The story begins by introducing Ajit Talwar (Kay Kay Menon), a successful businessman albeit with fishy dealings and an eye for pretty women. Ace tax-man MT Shekharan (Suresh Menon) has Talwar in his cross-hairs and is all set to nab him. Meanwhile, Bharat Bhushan is on a TV show where the audience loves his antics. Bhushan's popularity wins him the prize money and a holiday on a cruise-liner.Events unfold and the plot eventually leads Talwar and Bhusan to a marooned island, shot in Bintan, Indonesia where the lost duo meets a madcap photographer Raghu Burman (Amol Gupte) who loves Bhushan's singing. Shekharan who's on a chase adds to the mêlée. A twist here and there leads to an ending that seems quite pointless.In the absence of an 'inspiration', it appeared as if the filmmakers were lost about how to take it forward. Vinay Pathak becomes Bharat Bhushan, but his humor is predictable. One can find parallels with his role as Manu Gupta in 'Chalo Dilli'. Suresh Menon isn't as effective as Ranveer Shorey was in the first. Kay Kay Menon was as good as Rajat Kapoor was but didn't have a supporting character like that of Milind Soman's. Minisha Lamba was only supposed to look pretty.The first half had the perfect setting: a corrupt and womanizing corporate honcho, a funding hungry channel owner, reality TV, some adultery, a couple of tax sleuths who are best buddies but with opposing attitudes towards work, and all on a cruise liner for a weekend. But, the second half lost itself on the island as did its lead its characters.Seen stand-alone, it is a sub-standard screenplay which didn't use good actors like Kay Kay Menon, Vinay Pathak or even Amol Gupte. On whether it justifies the genre it belongs to, 'Bheja Fry 2' is quite funny at times, although not as funny as the first one was. Still, the actors manage to hold the plot together despite its flaws. Nonetheless, it is better than the multitude of senseless Akshay Kumar comedies that only ride on stars and item numbers. To sum up, Bheja Fry 2 isn't well cooked, but it won't hurt your tummy! But a wee bit of finesse could've made it much better." 
" A Fair Entertainer!","'Bheja Fry 2' is A Fair Entertainer, that works in bits and offers sincere performances from it's cast. However, it is not as good as it's predecessor. 'Bheja Fry 2' Synopsis: A tax-evading businessman and an income-tax officer get stranded on an isolated island.The film begins decently, dips quite a bit in the middle, but has a fair climax. Screenplay by Sharad Katari & Sagar Ballary, appeals in bits. The first-hour is decent, while the second-hour loses pace, but the climax, though not hilarious, is fairly engaging. In comparison to it's prequel, which is regarded as a cult-classic, the sequel falters. Sagar Ballary's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are perfect. Performance-Wise: Vinay Pathak returns as the kind yet annoying Bharat Bhushan, and he does well. Kay Kay Menon is superb, as always. Minissha Lamba is passable. Suresh Menon is genuinely funny. In fact, the Scenes between Vinay-Suresh, are quite funny & stand out. Aditi Govitrikar gets limited scope. Virendra Saxena is as usual. Amole Gupte appears in a half-baked role. On the whole, 'Bheja Fry 2' is no Masterpiece, but a fair entertainer nonetheless."
