" Wajahh: A Reason to Watch...?","This movie has A-list actors in a C-grade movie. Gracy Singh did a terrible job. I've never found her that great except for her debut. She definitely does not have star quality. Arbaaz wasn't that impressive either. Surprsingly, Shamita, in her comparatively brief role, gave a good performance and overshadowed her co-stars. After her comeback in Zeher, she's definitely here to stay. Her new bold look is very nice. The story could have been interesting, but it was presented horribly. When the culprit is revealed, it just doesn't gel or seem convincing at all. There are several loopholes in the plot, resulting in the story not making complete sense. Songs are pretty lame."
