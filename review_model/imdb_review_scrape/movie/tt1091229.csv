" A fun film to watch!","I think Chandi Chowk to China is a great film and it is fun to watch. I don't understand why most people don't like it but for me, the film was great! Akshay Kumar is just funny as hell in this film, playing his character Sidhu is just lol. I think he acted very well.Deepika Padukone is lovely as ever! Playing a double role again (First being (Om Shanti Om) she was great. I liked her character Meow Meow, i think that it is a cool name and a very cool character. Her action scenes at the airport was fantastic. She looked great in all her costumes and her hair/ make-up was very beautiful! Her other character was also funny Ms. TSM.Dada was great same as the other star cast in the film.The songs in CC2C was funny. I love the title track Chandi Chowkt to China and Tere Naine (The sky song)...Overall this film is a great watch! My rating for Chandi Chowk to China: 7/10" 
" Awesome cheesy fun!","I can't believe the low ratings this movie has gotten! My girlfriend and I just watched it and we loved it. Sure, it's incredibly cheesy and silly and over-the-top, but you can pretty much tell that from the cover and the entire basic premise of it, so anyone who isn't looking for something completely ridiculous should have known better than to watch it in the first place. I mean, come on. Bollywood martial arts movie! Was anyone really expecting high art? For what it was - a completely silly, campy, somewhat insane piece of fluff - it was really pretty awesome. Tremendously entertaining, with some great comedy, cool fight scenes (though it took a while to get to them - my only real complaint is that it was longer than it really needed to be), enjoyable music and dance scenes, and even something resembling an actual plot. Maybe you have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it, but if you are, it's a ton of fun and I'd highly recommend it." 
" Chandni Chowk to China- great entertainer!","CCTC is the first Indian martial arts movie that is very entertaining. Director Nikhil Advani and Akshay Kumar are the real stars that have made it a pleasant and interesting movie. It's really a great entertainer.Akshay Kumar who not only performs Martial arts, also emotes well throughout the entire movie. The film is full of thunderous performances. The film has excellent emotional chain between all characters. The stunts are the best ones I have ever seen. Other aspects like music,comedy,locations,cinematography and story with screenplay are also perfect. The Chinese actors are also good.On the whole,CCTC is a great entertainer all the way. Go,watch it and visit China with our desi stars!" 
" Um......there were some cheesiness......and cringing songs but...","Well I don't care if people bash and hate this movie....I just thought it was very good. I'm a fan of Gordon Liu and Akshay Kumar. my family enjoyed this movie and I repeat, we aren't even Hindi/Indian, white, or Chinese. So boo ya if ya didn't like this movie. I know that Akshay has a background in martial arts and to see him in action and comedy was all that matters. I thought Deepika was very pretty as Suzy That roger guy who plays the dad was awesome too! Gawd I hate people who are always so negative about a movie. even if some scenes were kind of dumb, I didn't mind. The critics and the haters just nag and nag about the film and the director. so what? there are some bad directors out there, we get it now. But there were some good scenes about believing in yourself or sumthing like that. and i absolutely laughed at the potato worship. I'm not even Hindi or Chinese and I understood this film more than the losers who degraded it. Yeah there were some cheesy scenes, bad choice of music, and stuff but overall I looked beyond that and had enjoyed the movie." 
" Overladen with clichés","If you take this film serious in any manner, you will not enjoy yourself. however, if you see this film for what it is: a Satire featuring every cliché x1000, you will laugh until your jaws hurt.Chandi Chowk to China uses the simple formula of the heroes' journey as often used in comedy. The Protagonist playing the not to bright dreamer who, a la Don Quixote de la Mancha starts on a journey which he believes is full of adventure and heroism, while onlookers will only see a man duped by his own foolishness.While not going into the story too much, you can rest assured that most clichés pass the revue, such as the long lost relative, Mr presumed dead but no body ever found (jee what would happen), and even, for your viewing pleasure an actual cliffhanger, just before the "break" to get your popcorn. (which I am sure plenty movie theatres do not feature, mine didn't.)Eventually our protagonist gets wise, but not after the necessary painful experiences, and slapstick. now I'm not too great a fan of slapstick, but the manner in which it is preformed makes you laugh nonetheless.The whole movie seems just an excuse for sheer entertainment, which you get in the form of very colourful and stylish scenes and surroundings, a great soundtrack accompanying 'fantasy' scenes in true musical style, and over the top martial arts scenes, which for once are choreographed well.It is a lengthy movie, so if you chose to watch it makes sure to relax and take your time, use that break. mind at zero, and you will have a great time.all in all it was a good film as it succeeds in what it attempts. it doesn't take itself seriously, and neither should you. although it has to be said, after a while you wonder where they draw the line, because it really is OVER the top. Great for kids and adults alike." 
" CC2C rocks","This movie is the most entertaining movie I've seen in recent times.. Simply hilarious..Not serious at all..A laughing riot.. The cinematography is great..so are the fight sequences.. Anyone with an iota of lively spirit in them would love this movie.. Every second of the movie is worth your money.. & you never get bored of at any point..like in Bunty babli during which I was like,"when does the movie start?" till the end titles.. CC2C is much better than OSO, Rab Ne, & most of the films this year. All those folks out there who didn't watch it just because sum stupid hearsay, go out & watch it..It's one grand movie...Entertainment at its best." 
" I don't know why but I liked it!","I went to watch this movie with my friends...all of us didn't know how or why we were enjoying....the story....was nothing.....the acting great! except for Deepika she did not make her presence felt even being in double role....but Mithun Chakrobaty sure did....but the movie belongs to Akshay Kumar.....in the first half all of us were holding our heads....but the second half is the real treat...it is correct revenge is a dish best served cold!.....the songs are definitely attractive but not blockbusters the picturiztion surely ruined some fun exceptions chak lein de the picturization in that song made the song even better..... All in all, A mindless comedy/action film including Jackie Chan spice except it's an Akshay Kumar movie!" 
" Same formula, but a lot worse this time !!","When I was going to watch this movie, I was just hoping that Akshay Kumar has not used the same formula again which he has been using in his recent movies - where he is a stupid, thick, ill fated guy who everyone hates, but still he makes the audience laugh due to the comical nature of the character. And then something completely unexpected happens which changes his life and he becomes a real Indian movie hero. This movie has also got the same old formula, but this time, the comedy in the beginning is by far the worst in his last few movies. Specially, the constant use of vulgar jokes (like breaking his balls or eggs, threatening to put a wooden stick into someone from behind, etc) don't help at all. Deepika has looked stunning in both the roles she has played. But apart from that, its all the same as "Welcome" and "Singh is King". The makers have tried to show some senseless and boring comedy. For example, Akshay gets away from the attack of about 25-30 enemies, completely unaware of them during dancing in one of the songs. Also, too many fighting sequences are just over the top. In short, the movie is a complete disappointment!!" 
" Its like a chowmien gone bad...","This is a great movie for those who've had 6 beers (or an equivalent amount of alcohol), or for kids (and those similarly intellectually inclined) or those who are fans of the mindless timepass genre, where you leave your brains at home, land up for the movie and then giggle aimlessly for the next three hours.All others, like me, will find this movie a disaster. And the sad thing is that they had an interesting premise  a Chinese village, suffering from a tyrant, finds out that they can be freed by an ancient warrior who has been reborn in India. But then its almost as if the 'brains' behind the film decided to see how much they could dumb it down, how much unnecessary slapstick & nautanki they could throw in, how complicated (actually that's too soft a word, convoluted is probably better) they could make the plot. How many films could they 'borrow' from  there are shades of Mr Natwarlal, Goldfinger and most old Hindi movies, with the whole twins separated at birth, amnesiac father et all. And in general, how far away from reality could they go If it weren't for Akshay, who still comes through with at least his acting reputation intact, if not his judgement, the rating would be even lower. Deepika is OK, looks good as always. Most others, well actually I'm being unfair on the actors as they were probably doing what they were told. And the songs were in keeping with the rest of the film. Effects, scenery and cinematography is decent. Fight sequences are OK OK - again too far away from reality for me to enjoy, they've almost created a real-life version of Kungfu Panda.I actually had high expectations from this one (because the premise was interesting) and maybe that's why I'm so disappointed. I laughed only once or twice throughout the film, most other times I was cringing, or holding my head in my hands. The audience was 50-50, a few walking out in the interval, despite having paid Rs 260 per ticket and some others laughing every time the director intended them to. They're actually planning a sequel to this, but despite being set in Africa, a herd of wildebeest couldn't drag me to that one" 
" Big disappointment from Akshay Kumar","I am a great fan of Akshay Kumar. I booked the tickets for the 1st paid premier show for this movie. But I was seriously disappointed. Comedy scenes wont make you laugh, by the time action scenes come u wont be interested. The movie doesn't excite you much and doesn't do anything to keep the audience glued to their seats. Their is no suspense, Deepika Padukone doesn't help either. Spoils the excitement as and when she appears on the screen. Their was so much fuss about the action scenes involving her, but those scenes has already been shown in all the trailers. The movie is very predictable. Very stupid at times. I will recommend this movie only if u don't have to pay for it and you have a lot of spare time.They are already planing a sequel. God bless the producers." 
" Thumbs down!","In the initial years of his career, Ramesh Sippy made two gems that we remember (and cherish) to this date -- SEETA AUR GEETA and SHOLAY. SEETA AUR GEETA was about twin-sisters -- the docile and the aggressive. SHOLAY, of course, needs no introduction. Yet, to update the unacquainted, Ramgarh is gripped by a terror called Gabbar. Resultantly, Thakur recruits two men to put an end to Gabbar's tyranny.Nikhil Advani pays homage to Ramesh Sippy's movies by merging SHOLAY and SEETA AUR GEETA. But this concoction called CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA is very very bland.Come to think of it, Nikhil Advani had everything going for him. It's a dream project, what with heavyweights such as Warner Bros., Ramesh Sippy, Akhay Kumar and Gordon Liu agreeing to be a part of this mammoth project. But Nikhil slips and trips, falling flat on his face.A mas-ala film is always welcome. In fact, two Desi films (RAB NE BANA DI JODI and GHAJINI) have been lapped up by the junta in a big way, but CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA is an unbearable mas-ala fare that insults the intelligence of the moviegoer.The problem with CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA is that it lacks a watertight screenplay to keep you glued for those 2.45 hours. Agreed, you don't look for logic and reason in hardcore potboilers, but the least the director and his team of writers could do is provide loads of entertainment. Sadly, writers Shridhar Raghavan and Rajat Aroraa make mincemeat of a plot that had the potential to woo viewers from Chandni Chowk to China to Chicago to Cape Town.So, what's the verdict then? Enjoy Chinese food instead. This one's a big, big, big letdown! Sidhu (Akshay Kumar) cuts vegetables at a roadside food stall in Chandni Chowk in Delhi. He longs to escape his dreary existence and looks for shortcuts -- with astrologers, tarot readers and fake fakirs -- believing anything except himself, despite his father figure Dada's (Mithun Chakraborty) best efforts.The story takes a turn when two strangers from China claim he's a reincarnation of a war hero and take him to China. Thanks to the devious translator, a conman by the name Chopstick (Ranvir Shorey), little does he know that he is being taken to the Chinese village of vicious smuggler Hojo (Gordon Liu).Therefore, Sidhu blissfully sets forth to China with Chopstick, who instigates dreams of a delicious future and forgets to reveal the perils, which await him. Along the way, he meets Sakhi (Deepika Padukone), who has embarked on a journey to pay homage to the land of her birth and her dead father and twin.Hojo catches up with Sidhu and eliminates Dada right in front of everyone. Sidhu seeks revenge and finds the one man who will make him a Kungfu expert and set the village free from Hojo's tyranny.On face-value, what do you expect from CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA? Laughter unlimited, great martial arts, a glimpse of China. But what's served on the platter is so insipid, so lame, so senseless that you wonder if there was a script in the first place. The comic scenes (that make you laugh) are few and far between. The scenes depicting martial arts are hardly exciting. Also, barring the Great Wall of China, don't expect China country tour here! There are big holes in the script. Sample these... * How and why do the two oppressed Chinese men suddenly land up in Chandni Chowk in Delhi? Also, how do they zero on Ranvir Shorey? No explanations offered. * Deepika's track of visiting China is trite. Wasn't the twin-sister, an infant, thrown off the Great Wall of China? How did Gordon Liu suddenly decide to bring her up? * Similarly, Deepika's father was also pushed from the Great Wall, but he survives. Akshay too is beaten black and blue and thrown off (coincidentally, from the same place -- Great Wall), but is rescued mid-air by Deepika's father. Miracles never cease to occur, must add.Post interval, Akshay undergoes a grueling training session, but not once does the preparation give an impression that Akshay is seething with anger and vengeance. That's because the director has injected humor in these scenes and that takes away the seriousness from the plot. The climax is equally contrived and hence, makes no impact whatsoever.Although the year 2009 has just begun, this film is sure to be a strong contender in Razzies in two departments mainly -- direction and writing. Nikhil Advani goes horribly wrong this time. As for the writers, well, they ought to take a crash course in film writing pronto. The songs are okay, with the title track and 'Naam Hai Sidhu' being the pick of the lot. The stunts (Dee Dee Ku) are plain mediocre. Even the dated martial arts' movies produced in the East offered better stuff. Himman Dhamija's cinematography lacks the picture perfect look.Akshay Kumar is the sole saving grace, but the director hasn't tapped his potential to the fullest. Deepika Padukone is passable. Gordon Liu is decent. Ranvir Shorey is functional. Mithun Chakraborty is bland. Roger Yuan, Deepika's father in the film, is fair.On the whole, CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA is a brilliant opportunity gone appallingly wrong. The film falls way below expectations and is a major disappointment in all respects. At the box-office, the hype might translate into a bountiful weekend, that's it. Thumbs down!" 
" surprising and imaginative","This film was a real surprise. it is playing at only one theater in the Chicago area. I came upon this film by accident. This film is full of imagination with some comedy. It is subtitled but it is very far away from the suburban humdrum mentality of so many comedies. The film is slightly like Forbidden Kingdom with Jackie Chan. But this film as a variety of aspects. The film is subtitled and is clearly connected to Bollywood. There are a few moments that breakout into dance and song which might be something audiences are not used to seeing.The film also jumps to comedy and action. There are plenty of action scenes. the lead actor is quite funny in a jerry lewis sort of way. But at times he is quite serious. The main actress is excellent playing more than one part. The film is subtitled but that is easy to get used to reading. There are also a number of excellent lines concerning themes like honor and loyalty for those interested in those ideas. It is an amazing blend .that may not be for everyone but this is not cynical humor. It is just plain funny at times. Pretty good music except for the closing credits. This film has many scenes by the Great Wall of China which is very interesting. I have never seen a Bollywood film but this certainly at least seems related to Bollywood. it is interesting that this film influenced by Bollywood is out at the same time as the excellent adventure drama Slumdog Millionaire." 
" must watch for Akshay fans","I think all those who r criticizing the movie its because they are jealous of his popularity. Movie is worth watching, don't go for the story just enjoy the comedy, few scenes in the movie are crap but action of the movie has never been shown in Indian cinema before. If the same scenes were done by Hollywood star people would have appreciated the stunts ,since it has been done by Indian star u say its crap. Movie is good see 4ur self, complete entertainer. Full of gags.Everyone has a different taste , according to me it's worth watching at least once. Even the crap scenes are well explained in the movie so I will suggest go for it and decide yourself. You will regret if you are missing." 
" A Fun-Ride in every aspect ... Awesome Movie","Just back from the paid preview and gonna tell that movie is a hell joy ride.The film starts off with a kung-fu fight with ancient Chinese legend ( lui sheng sumthing :p ) fighting till his death . . and then akshay is shown as his re-incarnation .. the rest involves how akshay ( Sidhu) lands up in china and how chopstick ( ranvir shorey ) traps him into big trouble .. and how he gets out of it ..The first half of the film is thoroughly entertaining and ends with a sad note .. the comic parts are hilarious and akshay is in full form yet again . . the songs are nice and apt for the situations .. Mithun Chakraborthy is good and does his role well . Deepika completely surprises with her looks and she is fabulous in the action sequences .the second half mainly is about how akshay takes his revenge on the villain ( Hojo ) and the Chek Lein De song is very nice and humorous ( Akshay's training for kung fu ) . The entertainment levels don't drop much .. but the sentiment scenes between the deepika twins ( dual role by deepika ) and their father are bit irritating ..The climax fight is short but is appropriate and has a comic touch to it .Overall . .the movie is completely enjoyable from the beginning to the end . The performance by akshay is top class and he rox . Deepika , Ranvir and the other Chinese have also done well . The music is nice and hummable .. And yea there is some good news for akshay .. fans .. at the end of the movie . "Chandni CHowk to Africa " was announced" 
" Highly recommended! not to go watch this movie!","Akshay has reached a super stardom. But he has become over confident of his stature today. He's taking his fans for granted! This movie like Tashan is an utter disappointment! High time Akshay gives his fans movies that are memorable, spectacular and remarkable rather than these mindless ones!There are couple of scenes in the movie which surely tickles your funny bone to the core! But, the way the story drags and too many coincidences gets you on your nerves.Initially the movie picks up alright. But, gradually you begin to start looking at your watch or at least start yawning!Although Akshay delivers his usual best, it feels he's wasting his talent in such mindless movies. All other actors are acted okay, but finally the storyline, humor or the narration doesn't give that punch.Today's audiences need some realistic movies & not stupid ones like this!" 
" Full mind review: Chandni Chowk to China - Underrated","Its way past the box office time, so this review is for buying DVD and watching it on TV.Okay everyone, people say this film was bad but my friend said it wasn't. I didn't listen to her and didn't watch the film, but realized my mistake after watching it on TV.I don't need to type the synopsis, I'll just write my opinion to it. Here's what my point of view says:- Their work - FIRST Indian martial arts film. I say it was well presented and a fresh idea. They shoot in China, used REAL Chinese (not stupid fake characters like in some movies) and good actors. Very impressive action scenes.Story idea - As said, fresh idea. I really liked the theme. The reason why this film have flopped might be that the story is not very new and some things aren't too. BUT the only overused Martial arts theme typically are of some cop who fights a drug dealer or gangster as revenge for his family or something, this is similar too but not completely. Slapstick comedies, some hard parts and few might look meaningless, but as long its entertainment. But do blend together well and is fine as long you cut stupid things.Acting - Akshay is good and maintains his comedy like always. I really liked Deepika in this film. She has a double roll (not a spoiler), and I personally liked the 2nd character she played. There's Ranvir Shorey who's fine and some unknown Chinese actors who're actually good.Music - Minimal songs but catchy enough. Songs "From Chandi Chowk to China", "Tere Naina", "Sidhu theme" and "Fatte Chak Lende" are energetic and probably the only used songs and have good timings.Direction - I don't know this director, but I don't find him bad. I don't why this film completely flopped. If 'Dhamaal' was a hit, then I supposed it to be at least an average grosser.Verdict - 6 out of 10. Why? Because this isn't a serious film and 7+ ratings are for really meaningful ones. 6 is just fine and its good.My opinion - I have seen this film like 5-6 times on TV and I always think what was that bad. If you're a fan of Akshay, Deepika, Martial Arts or just want a time-pass film, this is good for Home Video or even watching on internet. But AT LEAST watchable."
