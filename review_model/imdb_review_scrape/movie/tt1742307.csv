" Terrible movie!","This movie has been so hyped, I paid big bucks to buy it as it was not available for online rental so had to get a DVD mailed out to me. And I was immensely disappointed with it. Everything from direction, story, and acting was horrifying to say the least. Veteran actors like Zeenat Aman and Helen were awful, and so were the rest of the cast. This movie was set in Mumbai and was about an Anglo Saxon Indian family with a married son, who had an urge to explore the gay lifestyle, hence the hype. I feel this movie was targeted for the gay audience in mind given there are not many such movies out of Bollywood. This movie gets a rank of 1 as in my opinion it does not meet my entertainment standards." 
" India's answer to "Broke-back Mountain"? My Foot.","3.5/10??? This title is preposterously over-rated. Yes, you read it right, over-rated. Plot:- This title is about a hideous looking closeted and married man (Yuvraj Parasher) falling in love with another hideous looking effeminate dodo (Kapil Sharma, Bollywood director Anil Sharma's younger brother), who, I suppose is out (to whomsoever it may concern). They go to Goa (Gay Paradise of India) and make some nude gay love in a hotel room. (Yup, that is what all the gay couples - closeted or out, do in India; they all go to Goa to hump each other. Because in Goa, barring the Russian Govt., no one really cares. Not even the Indian Govt.) What the viewers get to see, after the clothes come undone, is an increased degree of hideousness. Yuvraj Parasher's nude buttock shot and our Dodo's stocky torso (passed off as biceps and triceps) in this movie possesses the power of converting any gay man to straight man. I did not really care to watch this title (free of cost on YouTube) beyond fifteen minutes of its run-time for the sole reason, that I feared, that I may forget my English grammar, sentence construction and pronunciation, that I learned in school and over the years.The title, when it came out (no pun intended), was hyped as India's answer to "Brokeback Mountain". One word - R.O.F.L. Whoever made such tall claims, for sure, was out of his/ her mind, or someone from the PR team, or someone who haven't seen "Brokeback Mountain", or someone who has got absolutely nothing to do with writing and making movies and who is spoon-fed to utter crap or someone who is fresh out of an asylum and given a job (out of compassion and humanity) to write about movies.The movie was real hot amongst the gay community in India when its release was due. But the hotness was washed off beneath the shower and beneath the jet spray in the privacy of bathrooms and loos. Because every gay guy in India is happily married with children and a lovely wife. (If U.K got Oxford, India has got Orthodox. Beat that.) So, no one, barring a few gay activists in Bombay, whose lives revolves around behaving effeminately all the time (under the pretense of activism for equal rights and liberation of gay community in India) and embarrassing everyone around, went to see this in theaters. Result - as expected, the movie bombed more seriously than the ones at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This movie, though, do have a few electrifying shock values - Firstly, singer Lata Mangeshkar, who is equated to the Hindu Goddess Saraswati revered for Knowledge, Music, Arts, Wisdom and Learning, croons the outright rubbish title track in English language. Mangeshkar sang a rendition of Anne Murray's "You Needed Me", live in concert in 1985 in Canada. This was a special request from the Grammy winner herself. Mangeshkar carried it off with aplomb and rendered beautifully. She has dabbled impeccably and soulfully in various languages, but English is surely not one of them. I believe that her rendition of "You Needed Me" gave her a wrong impression that she can sing in English as well. You have to listen to the rubbish title track of this movie to believe your eyes. Here, Lata Mangeshkar crooning in English about the pain and anguish of the gay community in India is like George Bush talking about world peace at the UN in Kurdish. I will say - C'mon old timer, just retire; retire with grace and when at "top" (No pun intended. Mangeshkar is female) of your game. Do not make yourself into a laughing stock. Go home and make Mutton Stock. I've read you are a fabulous cook and love gorging on Mutton. Second shock comes in the form of casting - Kabir Bedi, who acted alongside Roger Moore in 1983's "Octopussy" and a few other international productions, here, mouths lines that sound picked off from school text-books and passed off as dialogues. The presence of other critically acclaimed or revered actors in Bollywood - like Zeenat Aman, Helen and Rituporno Sengupta, only affirms the fact that they have all gone broke, if not bonkers, and did this atrocity passed off as India's answer to "Brokeback Mountain" just for money. The only "Pie for my Eye" apple in this "piece of work" is the salivating enough to give an instant hard on, hunk with the athletic physic and the devil from divinity is Maradona Rebello. But no need to go through this torture passed off as India's answer to "Brokeback Mountain" just for Mr. Rebello. In today's time, you can get ample of his clips from this garbage and his other works on the internet. Or simple, just google him. All in all, if you want to see a movie "coming out" (pun intended here) from India about homosexuality, then go for director Onir's "My Brother, Nikhil", released in 2005 and featuring Sanjay Suri and Purab Kohli as the gay lovers for life; with supporting cast of Juhi Chawla, Victor Banerjee, Lilette Dubey, Dia Mirza and film director Sujoy Ghosh (Jhankar Beats, Kahaani). A decade since its initial release in India, there have been no other film about homosexuality made that had a true depiction of the taboo subject. Not even Onir's own recent release - "I Am, Omar" could come close to "My Brother, Nikhil." One can only wish, gay relationships in India were like the one depicted in "My Brother, Nikhil", being true and faithful to each other all life.Unfortunately, it is everything like the garbage depicted in "Dunno Y" - sex craving closeted Muscle Marrys' hunting each other and then humping each other. Love ceases to exist anymore."
