" Singham roars!!",""Ajay Devgn , Prakash Raj, Rohit Shetty, Aave Singham, Kajal Aggarwal, Majja Satkeli, Gotya" These are some phrases that keep rolling onto your mind as soon as you leave the theater. While you are inside the theater, movie never gives you a chance to halt for a second; it's a helluva fun ride.Say it a Masala Movie, Family Entertainer, Paisa Vasool Movie or South Indian remake, I absolutely love this movie. I saw the portrayal of Pure India, Young India and Beautiful India in this movie unlike some movies which tend to show harsh realities and stuff.Ajay Devgn ( People say Salman is a Mass Actor, But I have never seen people in PVR Cinema cheering and clapping so much in any Salman Khan movie like they did for Singham ). He is undoubtedly a Hero. And Singham is all about his heroic portrayal done brilliantly by Rohit Shetty. Prakash Raj is one of the best (apart from remakes) that we have imported from Tollywood. He is a perfect goon, the tag which I would give to Amrish Puri or Amjad Khan or Prem Chopra.Direction by Rohit Shetty is awesome! Cinematography by Dudely is breezy and spirited (thanks to brilliantly shot action sequences.Who cares even if it is larger than life!) Screenplay by Yunus Sajawal is zippy. If these aspects would not have been better, than movie would have been high on style and low on content; which I am glad is not the case with Singham.Bunch of Marathi Actors and Kajal Aggarwal are takeaways too. The later looks as sweet as candy floss. Background Score (mostly made up from its title track) is up roaring and plays a major role behind Singham's coolness.The movie is made to make you feel good. And does it? Hell yeah!!" 
" Singham is better than Dabangg","What a movie, there is not one single moment the movie is dragging or the story get a bit boring. The movie is very fast paste and every single moment is enjoyable to watch.Ajay Devgan and the main Villain is Top Notch...both of them does a very good job. The new girl is cute to look at, and she does do her acting OK.The only minus in the movie is the songs, there is not one single song which touch ur heart, or U feel like listening to again.For me Singham is so far the best movie of 2011, and a big thanks for everyone involved from Directing to writing to give us a Damn Good Movie." 
" Watch It for Ajay Devgn & Prakash Raj's Performances...","Remember those films where one Hero, had the power & guts to bash up a dozen of baddies. Remember those films where the Hero was able to pull off any god damn thing to get justice? I am talking about the Cinema of the 1970's & 1980's. The time When Action Films ruled, when Escapisim ruled Hindi Cinema.'Singham' is old wine, in a new bottle. Directed by popular filmmaker Rohit Shetty, this action-flick/remake offers nothing new, in terms of story. But what it packs in efficiently, are the Performances by it's Screen-Hero Ajay Devgn & it's Screen-Villain Prakash Raj, who hold your attention, with their impeccable performances.'Singham' is the same old-story of how the GOOD tries his best to defeat the Evil. As said, in terms of story, there is no novelty, whatsoever! But, the Screenplay offers some really interesting moments, especially in the second hour, which is quite gripping. Plus, the confrontation scenes between the Good and the Evil, are arresting & effective. And even the Dialogue are clap-worthy and act as a major trump card for the enterprise.But, I would like to point out, that, the romantic-track, between the Hero & Heronie, is not up-to the mark and fails to leave an impact. The Drama works, the Romance doesn't.Rohit Shetty's Direction relies mainly on Stunts, and I must day, that, the Stunts/Action-Sequences, are well-done. Cinematography by Dudley is fine. Editing is fair. Music by Ajay-Atul, is decent.Performance-Wise: National-Award-Wininng Actors Ajay Devgn & Prakash Raj, play their parts impeccably. Devgn plays the Hero, superbly & looks the part to the T. Raj, on the other-hand, is nearly mesmerizing as the Villain. Plus, the chemistry between the two, is something to watch. Kajal Aggarwal is fairly nice. Ashok Saraf is first-rate. Sonali Kulkarni scores. Murli Sharma leaves a mark. Sachin Khedekar, Govind Namdeo & Sudhanshu Pandey lend able support.On the whole, 'Singham' is an entertainer, that doesn't disappoint, thanks to it's arresting second hour, clap-worthy scenes & above all, the performances by Devgn & Raj." 
" LOVED IT... couldn't understand a word of it, but LOVED IT","Yes, Bollywood has copycat syndrome, and extremely over the top moments, but what they do is make it work to be entertaining, not roll your eyes momentsFrom start to finish I was entertained and found the action scenes to be well paced, entertaining and made me feel Singham is the bollywood Norris, Chan, Willis and Schwarzenegger rolled into one.Couldn't understand a single word, but there was never a moment I was looking at my watch or wondering when it would end.American action films that go over the top don't do it properly, they need to study bollywood films like SINGHAM and make it work.I extremely recommend it." 
" A Nutshell Review: Singham","It's no secret I enjoy the slew of Hindi films out in the last year or so that feature tough, no nonsense cops as their lead protagonist, from Salman Khan's Chulbul Pandey in Dabangg that started the ball rolling, then Abhishek Bachchan as ACP Vishnu Kamath in Dumb Maaro Dumb, and now Ajay Devgn too getting into the act as the titular Bajirao Singham. Devgn's star has been shining quite brightly of late, with Raajneeti, Aakrosh and Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai from last year that allowed him to flex his acting muscles, and here he goes completely brawny as the cop symbolizing the themes from the lion motif of courage and raw power - even the opening song and dance credits are designed around the lion's roar and paw.Director Rohit Shetty teams with his preferred leading man Devgn to bring this remake of the Tamil film Singam which had starred Suriya, though in this version it's less of a mano a mano with the main villain Jaikant Shikre, where actor Prakash Raj reprised his villainous role as the chief gangster operating in Goa, whose links with politicians and the upper ranks of the police make him untouchable, so much so that he's responsible for the suicide of an honest officer whom he framed as he was getting too close for comfort in arresting him.It's interesting to look at the narrative as how a lion got taken out of its den and put into unfamiliar surroundings, forcing it at times into a corner. But like all wild animals, this may result in the animal biting back with increased ferocity. Similar to Chulbul Pandey, Bajirao Singham is a small village cop who represents the law in his hometown through a combination of strength, wisdom and plenty of slow-motion swagger, preferring community policing, and solving the community's problems without smacking down the penal code on offenders. This of course elevates his standing in the village, which comes in useful when he has to summon the big time gangster Jaikant to the station for a conditional bail release.In what he thought was a promotion for a job well done, Singham gets transferred to the city of Goa, before Jaikant lets loose that it's engineered through the greasing of palms, and now with Singham in Jaikant's town and reach, life becomes a living hell naturally. This toss up between hero and villain forms the bulk of the second half of the film in what would be a simple, straightforward story, made a lot enjoyable through its sheer entertainment value, with really deliberate, over the top action sequences that you'd chuckle at - you know, how one slap can leave a man flying through the air, or how there are many physics-defying moves that would make all would-be villains give up their life of crime when this long arm of the law reaches them. One of the more audacious stunts involves a car flipping through the air while our hero reaches in through the car window and yanking the driver out with one hand, before the car smashes through the ground. Take that, Hollywood!But all work and no play makes Singham a dull boy as well. In a typical Masala offering, Singham has its fair share of moments away from the pursuit of hoodlums, or goons as the subtitles would have it, for precious romance with Kavya Bhosle (Kajal Aggarwal) and family time both his and hers, and romantic song and dance interludes that are inevitable. Check out the title tune though which is quite reminiscent of Dabangg's exalting song of fearlessness.It's not all plain action oriented, as I would think some may find it controversial in Singham's unorthodox methods of fighting fire with fire when he discovers the rot in society is something quite beyond one man's ability to combat. I suppose tough cop stories will not go out of fashion from the Indian film industry anytime soon, for its tales of fighting against corruption in all strata and levels of society serving as an outlet in fantasy that can be eradicated completely with the enlistment of help from those who choose to stand up and be counted upon to do the right thing. This becomes that over-arching reminder in the film, despite Singham having to involve questionable methods (which can be easily classified as police brutality in certain countries) as well with the number of belt-whipping scenes, though in all earnestness, politicians such as the ones featured do deserve nothing more than a good smack on the buttocks.Still, his is a film after all, which allows for our fantasies at having those evil at heart receive their just desserts swiftly and painfully, without too much fuss in going through a system corrupted by the rich and powerful. Singham firmly sets itself as one of my favourites of the year, and it's wishful thinking on my part if Ajay Devgn and Salman Khan can share the screen together once again after London Dreams, to feature two tough police characters in one crossover film. Now that would be a double dose of hard hitting action and no nonsense police action adventure, and villains everywhere better beware! Highly recommended!" 
" Way better than Dabangg/Wanted/Ghajini","Singham is way better than Dabangg/Wanted/GhajiniBest: This movie has some really good story (Unlike Dabangg - IT was all about Salman's attitude which took movie to that level & Munni, Ghajini -> Music +Hype of Amir, Wanted is a real competitor)Superb screen play -> at least it won't make u bore in any part.Marathi atmosphere -> Its really nice to here Marathi in Hindi films (Remember old Hindi movies with at least few dialogues in Marathi) ... Feel's great !Prakash Raj -> villainous role is superb, Got a nice role & dialogues, even better than Wanted.Ajay -> Reminds me of Phool aur KaanteBad: Songs (Except title song - Singham) are not so good. Which was the plus point for other 3 movies.Ratings: 8/10 (Considering this as Bollywood movie + comparing with other Bollywood movies )" 
" A Loud,Desi,Masala Entertainer,Typical Of The 80's - Full Of Mass Appeal","Singham is an entertaining masala flick,a tribute to the 80's era of bollywood masala movies,an addition to the list of Hindi remakes of south blockbusters.I haven't seen the Tamil version,so a comparison is impossible.The film is full of energy,charisma and is sure to get mass applause from the people who love the true Indian flavored cinema,full of colors and raw fight between a honest,loved-by-all hero and the baddie.Seeing these kind of films,i wonder whether the age of pure entertainers is back,after films like Wanted,dabangg and ready have become blockbusters.No doubt,Singham is a sure shot blockbuster,at least in single screens.Director Rohit Shetty,after making some hilarious comedies have gone back to his base and have created an Action packed entertainer(Rohit shetty stared off with Action thriller,Zameen also starring Ajay) which is full of mass appeal.Performances::Ajay Devgn is full of energy and does 100 % justice to his cop uniform.A bunch of Marathi actors,especially Ashok Saraf deserves a big thumbs up for their excellent performances.kajal Agarwal doesn't get needed opportunities to showcase her talent,but makes her presence felt among the audience.Prakash raj is as always at his best .Some +ves::The bench of Marathi actors who does a brilliant job and the Ajay Charisma,Entertaining direction by Rohit shetty,Thrilling Background music,Editing work by Steven.H.Bernard,The raw,desi flavor of the movie.Some -ves::A familiar plot is again used,Very weak love base,The Marathi accent of Ajay,which seems artificial at times.Music by Ajay and Atul Gogavale,noted Marathi music director duo is hummable and melodious.It can be given a 7/10.Verdict::Singham is an action-packed masala movie,a reminder of the 80's era.It is full of unadulterated raw desi flavor and is sure to entertain the masses.Go for it,if you love masala entertainers.Ma Rating::8/10" 
" Packed up with iron claws","When you think of a bollywood action flick , you expect a fair amount of dramatic rush going down your spine. But unlike other action movies, Singham is indeed a different film because it's main focus is it's action which packs nothing in excess.After the huge success of action films like dabanng and wanted, Singham also was aimed at full-blown action fun with some decent and convincing fighting sequences. The storyline features Bajirao singham (Ajay devgan) an honest police cop, a good friend and a dark cloud for the wrong doers. when away from his village he is transferred to the city, he walks into an face to face battle with the criminal and his empire. Aprt from the story Ajay devgan is a treat to watch because he has forever been a part of action genre for the cop movies like wanted, dabanng and his very own gangaajal. Also the film did well because of it's great supporting cast and performances.But apart from the engrossing action fun the film lacks humor. Also the idea is not innovative and is kinda old-fashioned. But the plot is interesting enough to grab your attention quickly and pretty early. Ajay Devgan's girlfriend (Kajal aggarwal) did well on part of her acting but was offered little scope to leave a mark of minds of audience. To be honest the movie offers nothing original but is interestingly crisp and fresh stuff for the movie goers. Overall, an entertaining film for the action lovers and if you want a dose of it then Singham is the one for you." 
" Singham the real Lion","the best remake from the south so far in Indian cinema history. acting of ajay devgan and prakash raj is mindbloing. direction of rohit shetty also appreciable. even better movie then dabangg. rohit please keep making these kind of movie forever only. with ajay devgan because devgan is a gun that wins the heart of everyone. go to theater and you will get the magic of this film,and your heart will say lets watch the movie again and again and again. editing in this film is also very good and the co ordination between all the dialogues and the brilliance of ajay devgan has been syncrinized beautifully by rohit shetty and they have made a super duper hit movie of the year." 
" Though not great but still has some timely roars of a LION and a likable climax.","With SINGHAM sons of two famous action masters of Bollywood return to their original genre in style. Veeru Devgun (Ajay's father) and Shetty (Rohit's father) were known for their own class in the Industry few decades before and now their proud sons return to the same genre, with which they had started. But sadly the attempt remains a visibly polished product only having few weak associations in the narrative which don't really give you a DABANGIAN kind of entertainment on the whole. Still it cannot be called a bad film for sure because it does have some great moments to offer and a winner climax which scores a clear six at the end, acting as its big savior. It's an Official remake of Tamil Hit Movie SINGAM and is all about an honest cop fighting against a mafia don and his empire based on strong political connections. Being a remake it has got all the ingredients of a typical south masala film which are just there to add some extra flavors into the film and nothing else. For instance, there is a love affair track going along with the Cop's fight which has no value of its own in the script, as usual there is a deliberately created comedy track around the pet name of a character which successfully generates some laughs in the start but later on becomes annoying. And as seen before, there exists the same eccentric kind of villain working against the Cop, whose dialogues become comical towards the end, played once again by the one & only Prakash Raj. The film starts off well with an impressive sequence revolving around the expressive eyes of a small child. But post that for about 1 long hour, it offers nothing as per the expectations raised, until the scene where Ajay and Prakash meet for the first time. The LION actually starts roaring at this very moment and then keeps roaring post interval till the climax in gaps. Hence the first half is not that effective as compared to the second one since it keeps focusing on various other subplots in the script, which do not register at all. The romance track falls flat and so does the family comedy angle forced into the proceedings to provide some relief moments. Though SINGHAM scores high in its technical department such as Cinematography and Action, but it fails completely in its soundtrack. Ajay-Atul's music works just as a filler with nothing worth listening. And its really annoying to hear another title song inspired from the cult Vishal Bhardwaj's track "Omkara", sung by Sukhwinder. Moreover the Background Score is both effective as well as noisy at times with excess of loud arrangements in all those slow motion sequences. Apart from Ajay Devgan and Prakash Raj, only Sudhanshu Pandey and Sonali Kulkarni are able to make an impact on the viewer and rest all work under the shadow of its two main giants. The debutant Kaajal looks fresh and bubbly but in absence of anything special written for her, she is not able to prove her talent in any of her scenes. Ajay Devgan once again proves his versatility, returning to the action genre after a string of comical hits. His body language, specifically his eyes seem to be just perfect for such roles and he comes up like a winner all through the film. Prakash Raj though is splendid in his typical negative role but this time it looked like repetitive to me towards the climax. Yet he is immensely watchable with Ajay on the screen. In short the film completely belongs to Ajay and Prakash Raj who generate such kind of mighty impact in their scenes together that the single screen theaters are bound to go full of whistles, claps and thundering applause.In fact, the main reason behind the probable success of this film has to be these particular scenes (including the one with the Neta Ji) where Ajay answers his powerful enemies with fiery dialogues and strong punches along with its worth watching action sequences which have been shot with élan. However, at times the action also seems to be too unbelievable with some impossible kind of stunts. In the writing department, I particularly liked the thought of the National Emblem being given to the cops to wear it in their caps but not to the Country's top political leaders to use it in their dresses. Plus the icing on the cake, for all the viewers loving such kind of over the top, masala cinema, should be its well written climax which really needs to be applauded for its thoughtful idea and brilliant execution. So, overall SINGHAM does have its merits in the form of some worth watching confrontation sequences and superb action. But if you are looking for something fresh or novel then you are sure going to be disappointed with its routine kind of content. The film is not consistent enough in its narration as the real action starts after almost 45 minutes into the movie and it also becomes a bit repetitive towards the end. Yet, for all Ajay Devgan's fans its festival time in the theaters. However the last half an hour of the film forced me to think about its original makers of the South.To be specific, it struck me that if South Films are able to think of such great climax and other similar interesting plots in their own movies which in turn inspire Bollywood to make their remakes, then certainly the SOUTH CINEMA is miles ahead of Hindi CINEMA in film-making. May be the Hindi Film Industry is enjoying more success due to their over-popular stars and glamour but if studied in real sense then South Cinema is undoubtedly more important, experimental and bold which needs to be recognized at the earliest as an essential part of Indian CINEMA." 
" Singham is how it should have been...","Mann bhanvar uthe, tan sihar uthe, jab khabar uthe ki aave... Singham!! The line from the title song aptly depicts what Singham is in the movie. The movie is not just another movie to me but based on a simple but strong theme which the movie rightly justifies.Singham is not just the name of the movie, but the idea that is replicated in depiction, dialogues, songs and action... i.e. everywhere.Singham (Ajay Devgan) lives in his own happy and non-corrupt world which is disturbed by the villain of the movie. And the story is how he deals with it. Though, it seems more about clash of egos than the clash of ideologies; however, the message is positive.One thing I liked the most in the movie is the power of unity and leadership that is shown. Singham is the man of right deeds and whole village will stand by him in case of any threat. He replicated the same at the new place he has been sent to and hence in the hour of need, everyone was standing by him.The message that there are people in the system who want to do real good but are crushed by the wrong-doers is true and well known. The movie is an entertaining mix of reality and dramatization.I hope right people take right inspiration from it! :) :)" 
" Rohit Shetty + Ajay Devgan = Fantastic Movie","Okay I cannot believe I ignored watching this movie for this long. I guess the name "Singham" threw me off as it sounded like a low-budgeted political kind of movie.A little did I know it was a Rohit Shetty's movie, as I always see him as comedy director. So I decided to go ahead and watch it. And I can honestly say from beginning till the end, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. Fantastic acting my Ajay Devgan. Indian residents are complete idiots for liking "Chulbul Pandey" so much, Salman's acting was not even close to Ajay's role in this movie.Action was great, casting was great. Prakash Raj has now become my favorite villain of all time. He was damn good in Wanted and I had hoped to see him again and thankfully he was in Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap. But I had no idea I will see him again in this movie, I absolutely loved his acting. So far my favorite villains has been: Amrish Puri, Ashutosh Rana, Rahul Dev, and now it's Prakash Raj. I really hope to see him more and more.I really hoped Rohit Shetty would've given this movie a different title to attract more audiences because this movie was 10x better than Wanted, and 20x better than Dabaang.Well Done Rohit Shetty and Team!!!!" 
" Converted Bollywood fan","Been watching Bollywood movies for a few months now and they just don't disappoint. Singh a.m. has Over the top action, bit of cheesy romance, but it all just works with a great story" 
" Awkwardly funny","Kind of bizarre for western culture. Lots of funny impossible action scenes. Singham alone could defeat all expendables with a single strike.Not to mention, his girl - Kavya, it a really beautiful woman. Kajal Agarwal was a perfect pick for this role.For moviegoers who does not know the Indian productions this is a must see, as it will serve as a sample of what is considered a good production on India. It is a different country, a different culture, and of course, the movie industry has got different models and standards.In spite of being quite long (~2h20) is worth seeing. And I would recommend you to watch it in a group of friends. You will laugh a lot and on some scenes you will certainly have an urge to talk immediately about it with someone." 
" Total entertainer – paisa vasool","There isn't much in the movie in terms of a story. Its your usual bad guy vs the good. You'll have a hearty laugh throughout.All the characters seems to be hand picked for their respective role. They have all done a fantastic job. Prakash Raj is hilarious but has his hangover from Wanted. The character Gotaya will leave you in splits.The background score is OK but adds its punch whenever required. The action is Rajnikanth style defying all logic but thats the charm of the movie.The songs in between do break the rhythm of the movie but it ends quickly. Watch it with a group who can whistle and you will enjoy yourself thoroughly.I liked Kajal Agarwal from her Telugu hit Maghdeera. Doesn't add much to the movie but its not irritating either." 
" excellent movie, gr8 storyline Ajay the best","this is a gr8 movie awesome storyline, with gr8 action scenes. story is about a honest policeman who commits suicides due to such consequences the villain in this movie. Then comes the actor a honest policeman lives in a small village with his family. He thrashes people who r corrupt and takes bribe money and cheating and all. The Love Story in this movie between actress and Ajay drives this movie to intense action little romance and gr8 drama this movie shows how the police system should work. Politicians should get bashed for their corruption and cheating and all. this is what the movie shows. A total entertaining movie with loads of action and drama. This movie is a full package entertaining movie. Ajay and the Director Rocks. Movie: 10/10, Songs: 9/10, Acting: 10/10 Direction: 9/10. Overall: 9.5/10 A must watch movie for anyone."
