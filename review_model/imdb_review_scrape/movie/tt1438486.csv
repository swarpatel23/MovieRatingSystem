" An indeed sincere effort","If actors try to enact the way common man does and director try to portray the living hood of common people then indeed this movie is a sincere effort. I have watched this movie quite couple of times and it's an easy going stuff, a light hearted movie with no pretension of making it to be a cult classic or a Masterpiece. Govinda has done a character role, suitable to his age and movie gives a rustic flavor. As I said it's indeed not the best movie but truly one of those rare ones which depends upon the content and the characters. Movie is a drag in bits but surely engages you till the end. No glossy stuff, plain Cinematography, and kind of art movie stuff. Negatives This should have been released some time before, like Sandwich somewhere when Govinda was doing Beti No 1, Joru Ka Ghulam kind of Movies. Cinematography is simple but just not up to the current scenario, its Bland. Songs are not worthy and should have been simply discarded. NOTE: I don't know what Director thinks about this one but certainly from my perspective it's a Drama film, lesser on the melodrama quotient and more on the characterization." 
" Govinda's delayed film continues","Another of Govinda's delayed film like SANDWICH which was in cans for a long timeThe film also has a forgotten Reema Sen or is that her name?The movie is the same old gheesa peeta formula and if u can stand such comedies today great for you otherwise a time wasteThe film has Govinda play a role he has 10 years back and with no change Here he owns a bus which was like a storehouse of pigeons and then changed and made a nice busThey get drivers like Razzak Khan and another looserThen they is some union fight after Govinda gives a dhamkee to Razzak after an accident and then i switched off the TVDirection is poor, Screenplay is non existent Music is nothing great Editing is weak and also is the sound recordingGovinda repeats his act, Rajpal too shows no variation Reema is forgettable Razzak Khan is as usual Asrani and rest are the same"
