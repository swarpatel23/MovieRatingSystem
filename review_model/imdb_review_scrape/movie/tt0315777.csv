" 10","Amazing Film. Must watch. Very Nice. Very Good. The Best Film of Ashutosh Rana." 
" Best movie based on Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev in the modern day","I have seen this movie many times and I have liked it. The story, music, cast etc is great. Om Puri is the best actor in Bollywood. Whatever roles given to him, he comes out shining. His voice, acting, dialogues etc is powerful. He did a good job even in this movie also. Infact, the entire movie goes to him. Its good to see Ashutosh Rana in a positive role (Raaz, Kasoor, Tamanna, Gunaah, Dil Pardesi Ho Gaya etc are the movies where he played positive roles) after seeing him playing negative roles all the time. Abbas, the south actor too did a commendable job. The heroines were ok and could have done better. Nadeem Shravan's music was good. Masoom Chehre and Hum Apni Taraf Se were the best love tracks and was beautifully. This movie of 2002 was a success at the box office due to its good storyline, acting, music, cast. Enjoy the movie and feel the patriotism of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev arising in you."
