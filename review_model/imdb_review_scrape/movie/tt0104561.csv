" from Orkut's JJWS-Community-Owner; JJWS is the Best Aamir Khan Movie of all time. - Aamir's Career-Best film !!!","I give JJWS 10/10,100/100,1000/1000-----"The victory of the underdog" theme makes for great entertainment. a true classic; it has that Aamir stamp all over it. This is a movie I've wanted to write about since ages. I seriously think its one of the most understated movies of Hindi cinema. It clearly hasn't received its due credit. This is the story of a family;family of a father & two young sons;about the bond between them;story of a small town life. JJWS is so real. Life of a small town boy .... who initially is Carefree & fun-loving;goes to the extent of causing a lot of trouble thru his actions; BUT eventually,he takes a u-turn,turns a new-leaf & Decides to take revenge in a very special-way...he also starts respecting both his Father & ever-supportive Brother......I love that scene {just before final cycle race} where Sanju starts crying & talks to Ratan - feels bad that Ratan couldn't take part in the race because of Sanju's tussle with the villainous Rajput-champ...Victory at the end wiping out all his past-antics----JJWS is complete.The characters just live with you in day-to-day life.The vision of the director is so fantastic,and never has he had to sacrifice entertainment to fulfill it.JJWS covers so many different aspects of a teenagers life and the movie has been so tastefully done that one can easily relate to the theme being portrayed.I say this because I grew up watching JJWS and have seen it almost 60 times and each of those times i have discovered some new aspect of the movie. The attention to detail is immaculate and this is the hallmark of a good movie. One of the most interesting aspects of JJWS is the background score. Not for one moment do you feel that the music doesn't belong there and has been inserted there just for the heck of it (as is the case with most of the movies of the time). The training montage(when Sanju prepares for the final cycle race), the music when the race is going on, the music when the Rajput boys go through MalRoad (shouting Vir Bahadur Ladke Kaun...) and for that matter every second of JJWS has remarkable music complementing the stellar performance. The way the song 'Pehla Nasha' captures the feeling of your first crush cannot be described. Jatin Lalit have really done a wonderful job. Last but not the least the way human emotions have been portrayed in JJWS is beyond comparison. I will never forget the scene in which Sanju(Aamir) tells his father that Ratan has had an accident. The acting by both the actors doesn't go overboard and there's no melodrama; the scene finds its place among the best in my mind.In my opinion JJWS was way ahead of its times in Hindi cinema and has been denied its due credit as a result of internal politics in Bollywood.What really makes JJWS compelling viewing is director Mansoor Khan's simple yet excellent narrative. Most of the characters are etched out well. Some great relationships are portrayed in the movie.....The coldness between Sanju & his dad is brought out in the movie pretty well. Secondly, between Sanju and his best friend Anjali who turns out to be his love eventually. Sanju never sees the love Anjali has for him, until she's the only support he has when he's alone in life. Thirdly, between the two brothers Ratan and Sanju.....who are as dissimilar to each other as one can think of......but are still so close to each other. One of the best sibling relationships portrayed in a Hindi movie. Three cheers for Aamir who has defied his chocolate-boy looks to emerge as the most-varied actor of his time.----- The biggest thing for the people in the town is the inter-school sports competition held every year. Ever since his cycling victory against the Rival school Rajput, Ramlal has been obsessed with Model beating them, through his obedient older son Ratan; Model's model student, in studies, sports and character and the pride of his father. there's one student who can win laurels for his school.....the honest, hard-working Ratan who's the "gem of Model High School". Ratan is determined to win this race this time......but courtesy a fight with Deepak Tijori and gang, he falls from a cliff and is badly injured. Model High's only hope.....Ratan can't participate in the race now, and Model has to be content with its usual "pyjamachaap" image. Sanju, is a happy-go-lucky bloke who loves hanging with friends and having fun in life even if it causes him to fail classes and disappoint his father. When this sudden tragedy occurs to Ratan, Sanju is transformed from a guy with not a care in the world to a responsible friend, brother, son and athlete. The stage is now set for a tale of friendship,love,family,sports and competition told beautifully by Mansoor Khan. All the performances are in top form.Aamir Khan is as adorable as ever as Sanju. You can't help but love him in this sweet role. Special mention should go to Mamik who plays Ratan. He put in a very sincere performance. you can't say that that was his first movie.he looked like a seasoned performer. It is too bad he wasn't seen too much after JJWS. Overall the movie was excellent. Amazing story, great performances and sweet music, well-defined small-town cinematography,nice melodious songs.....all-gr8-gripping-cycle-race-scenes . From start till end this movie keeps you glued to your seats. Performance...a top notch.Aamir Khan,Mr perfectionist, was totally remarkable.He is the soul of this film.From his starting non-serious attitude to ending maturing person was tremendous. The bike race is symbolic-especially for Sanjay, who finally reaches a level of maturity and realizes what needs to be done in order to prove for himself that he can do what needs to be done along with showing his family that he is capable of doing it. His understanding of his brother matures during the movie. This is a Must See if you enjoy Aamir Khan movies !" 
" great movie","This is one of my favorite movie. Watched it many time and every time it keeps getting better and better. A very entertaining, energetic,emotional, inspiring movie. The movie is a blend of excellent screenplay, direction, music and acting, great in every aspect of film making that is the reason why you will want to watch it again and again.It's Mansoor khan's excellent direction that every actor Aamir Khan, Ayesha Jhulka , Deepak Tijori,Pooja Bedi really got into the skin of there character, even Deepak Tijori's friends were so good that no one else could take there place" 
" Inspiring movie",""The victory of the underdog" theme makes for great entertainment. The story takes place in a hill-station, which is a centre of many boarding schools. And all the schools have their share of financially rich students.....except Model School, where all the relatively poorer students go to. And among big schools like Rajput, Xavier's, Lawrence and Queens....Model High is a misfit. So, the students studying there are ever-ridiculed, and labeled as no-hopers. But there's one student who can win laurels for his school.....the honest, hard-working Ratan who's the "gem of Model High School". Ratan's family includes his father and brother Sanjay who also studies in the same school (but is diametrically opposite to his brother). Sanjay is least interested in anything else apart from whiling his time away and having fun with his group of "pyjamachaap" friends. Cut to the main plot.....there's an annual inter-school bicycle race, which is always won by the Rajput College brat Deepak Tijori. He and his friends are the greatest bullies around. But Ratan is determined to win this race this time......but courtesy a fight with Deepak Tijori and gang, he falls from a cliff and is badly injured. Model High's only hope.....Ratan cannot participate in the race now, and the school has to be content with its usual "pyjamachaap" image. Not quite!!! Ratan's good-for-nothing brother Sanju takes up the challenge on behalf of his brother, and despite no one giving much of a chance in the race......no prizes for guessing who turns out the winner in the end!What really makes Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar compelling viewing is director Mansoor Khan's simple yet excellent narrative. Most of the characters are pretty etched out as well. Some great relationships are portrayed in the movie.....that of Sanju and his father (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda). The coldness between the two of them is brought out in the movie pretty well. Secondly, between Sanju and his best friend Anjali who turns out to be his love eventually. Sanju never sees the love Anjali has for him, until she's the only support he has when he's alone in life. Thirdly, between the two brothers Ratan and Sanju.....who are as dissimilar to each other as one can think of......but are still so close to each other. One of the best sibling relationships portrayed in a Hindi movie....far different from the overly melodramatic brotherly love that one is used to seeing. And of course, none of this would have been possible without the actors.......so there's Deepak Tijori who truly irritates you with his brattish attitude, the hot (but not very emotive) Pooja Bedi as Devika, Kulbhushan Kharbanda as the father who admires his elder son and is frustrated and aloof with his younger son (but loves him nevertheless), Ayesha Jhulka (in her only memorable role) as Anjali who has always loved Sanju but does not get the reciprocation from him, Mamik as the sincere Ratan.......and of course, Aamir Khan who's the soul of the movie. As usual, the actor gives a marvelous performance as Sanju. Three cheers for this actor who's defied his chocolate-boy looks to emerge as the most-varied actor of his time. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the melodious music......almost all songs are great to hear, with "Pehla Nasha" being the highlight.All, in all.......the movie does inspire you, and after you've seen it....you do feel like doing something similar for your own school/college as well." 
" Splendid Entertainment..!!","If you have not yet watched this fabulous movie staring Aamir Khan than do watch it as this is really a must watch flick.It not just holds good on entertainment but is also an inspiring story about transformation of a spoiled youngster played by Aamir Khan. The movie holds great control on nearly all its features.Weather it be the acting by Aamir Khan and the supported cast.Or the music with tracks like Pehla Nasha and the title track. Also a very good cinematography.The last scene is one of the best sports scene in Indian movies.Its inspired by the Hollywood movie "Breaking Away" but it contains many of its original features too. Go for this one.You will not be disappointing." 
" Overall a highly recommended film for audiences who appreciate a little drama, good performances and an entertaining few hours.","Long Review:Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander (JJWS) is a heart-warming story of a young man, Sanju, his buddies and his family consisting of his father (Ramlal) and an older brother(Ratan). The story is set in a hill station where the richest families send they're kids to school. Apart from top notch schools, there are also a few local ones like Model in which Ramlal is a coach and Ratan, Sanju and their friends attend.The biggest thing for the people here is the interschool sports competition held every year. Ever since his one cycling victory against the Rival school Rajput, Ramlal has been obsessed with Model beating them, through his obedient older son Ratan. Ratan is Model's model student, in studies, sports and character and the pride of his father. Sanju on the other hand is a happy-go-lucky bloke who loves hanging with friends and having fun in life even if it causes him to fail classes and disappoint his father.
Sanju's friends consist of two good-hearted but not so bright boys and a tomboyish girl, Anjali who is also secretly in love with Sanju. A fact that Sanju is unaware of. When an sudden tragedy occurs, Sanju is transformed from a guy with not a care in the world to a responsible friend, brother, son and athlete.The stage is now set for a tale of friendship, love, family, sports and competition told beautifully by Mansoor Khan. The music is light and sweet especially Pehla Nasha (amazing job by Udit Narayan) and the title song which is uplifting.All the performances are in top form. Aamir Khan is as adorable as ever as Sanju. You can't help but love him in this sweet role. Ayesha Jhulka is also very good as the loyal friend. Deepak Tijori is also quite despicable as the bad guy. The rest of the cast is also very competent and fit their roles well. Special mention should go to Mamik who plays Ratan. He put in a very sincere performance. It is too bad he wasn't seen too much after JJWS.
Overall the movie was excellent. Amazing story, great performances and sweet music. Definately recommend it to everyone, young and old alike will enjoy this movie thoroughly." 
" The best, realistic, coming of age sports movie. It has drama, thrill n comedy too.","Top notch direction by Mansoor Khan (Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak). Perfect editing by Zafar Sultan n Dilip Katalgi. Awewome cinematography by Najeeb Khan. I saw this first on a rented VHS. After that I bought the VHS. Now planning to buy a DVD. This is a sports movie, in this movie the lead character, the brilliant Aamir, races bicycles, it has a contest at the end. This movie made so many teens mad with bicycle lust. Of course this is not just a bicycle film. Its a sweet lil masterpiece. A hidden gem. A classic. Its one of the few realistic coming of age stories. The characters are really likable and the acting is great too. Must watch for every teen. Everybody can relate to the characters. Whether still young or now old, many small-town and college-town guys who grew up with a tight circle of best friends will relate to this movie. I got so absorbed that I felt I was among them. Such was the impact of the acting by all. The final bike racing sequence is an adventurous and glorious experience. Every time I come across this film i cant help but to watch from start to finish. Last but not least, the awesome PEHLA NASHA song." 
" Classic","there are some films you watch once, feel good and nice, then forget as years pass on. on the other - hand there are some films which though you had watched them in your growing years and liked them, but whenever you catch up with them, it feels like you are watching them the very first time. And needless to say, they bring a smile on your face. Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992) is a film which I categorize in the latter. Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (abbreviated as JJWS) is a film which even if I try, I cannot fit into one genre. It is a love story, it is a musical comedy, it is a thriller (no not the thriller in the murder mysteries sense), it has a heady cocktail of emotion and drama and list goes on. Starring Aamir Khan, Ayesha Jhulka, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Mamik, Deepak Tijori, Pooja Bedi and Asrani in pivotal roles JJWS is set in small hilly town of Dehradun. In fact, the film opens with an overview of what is to come by. Schools are separated and segregated by Class and Status of people. Model School, Rajput School, Lawrence, Xaviers and Queens. Model School has the Tea Vendor's, Motor Mechanic's kids as students. Rajput, Lawrence and Queens are having kids from higher status and class of people. But among all these differences and inequalities one thing or one common thread which bonds all these schools and their students alike is the Annual Sports Meet. The stakes are high for single biggest sporting event in the hilly town. The Pyjamachaps (Model School Boys as christened by Rajput Boys) have a lot to prove, the Rajput's have to stamp their authority and in turn woo the Queens Girls. Lawrence and Xaviers too are not behind. Hopes and Dreams are riding high on the Cycle Race. Ratan Lal Sharma (played by Mamick) gets defeated by Rajput Boys' Shekhar Malhotra (played brilliantly by Deepak Tijori) in the Cyccle Race as his cycle is inferior quality and make than Shekhar's Italian one. Ramlal Sharma (assayed by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) vows to buy an imported bicycle for next year's Cycle Race by saving money. Inflated by the win, Shekhar Malhotra roams around the town with his gang of friends (Sooraj Thapar only I can reminisce) on Bikes, a Car, woos and flirts Queens College girls. He bullies and ridicules the Model School Boys. In comes Sanjay Lal Sharma (nickname Sanju) a happy go lucky sort of guy who is good for nothing, roams around with his sidekicks (Ghode -- played by Aditya Lakhia and Deven Bhojani ), dreams about Queens' College Girls, bunks classes, and is a laggard in studies as well as sports. Sanjay Lal Sharma (played by Aamir Khan) and Shekhar Malhotra's paths cross when they fall and try to woo the Queens College hottie and bombshell -- Devika (marvellously played by Pooja Bedi). Devika learns about Shekhar's flirtatious nature and arrogance, therefore tries to settle scores with him along with Sanjay Lal Sharma's help. Meanwhile, Anjali (played superbly by Ayesha Jhulka) has a soft corner for Sanjay. She too studies in Model School. She's in for a rude awakening when she assumes that Shekhar will confess his love for her. In turn, she finds Shekhar and Devika together. She takes this heartbreak in her stride pretty well. having said that, Devika dumps Sanjay and gets along with Shekhar. Things take another ugly turn, when Ratan gets into a fight with Shekhar and his gang. Ratan suffers severe injuries and his dream of participating and ultimately defeating Shekhar too shatters. However, jolted by these multiple debacles in his life in a short span of time Sanjay takes up the responsibilities of his house-hold. Nursing and attending his injured elder brother, consoling his father (Ramlal Sharma), we see a dramatic transformation in Sanjay's character. Ramlal Sharma too is very disappointed, that his elder son will not be able to make to the Annual Cycling Race. Disillusioned too because he has purchased the imported Italian Bicycle from his yearly savings. Sanjay too gets support from Anjali, who stands by him like a rock and also helps him train for the Annual Cycle Race. Another, powerful and important scene in the film, is the realization of the changes happening in Sanjay from his elder brother Ratan. He even relinquishes his position as a competitor and participant in the Annual Cycle Race and asks Sanjay to step into his shoes. the Final Cycle Race is really an edge of the seat matter. In a nail biting finish, Sanjay topples and pips Shekhar and emerges victorious. Lot of takeaways from JJWS. Nothing is impossible, Hard Work and Perseverance are keys to success and victory. In order to prove oneself in front of the world --- actions speak louder than words. Friends are forever, the self realization and self introspection is sufficient to discover the hidden strengths and talent. Coming First and emerging Victorious is one thing, but maintain that consistently is altogether a different ballgame. Underdog tag helps in the respect, that an Underdog has nothing to lose. The JJWS story is very simple but is told in a very different manner. The Key ingredients of the story, are aforementioned. Music too is a USP of JJWS. Lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri is top - notch. The Film's signature dialog "Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar" you will get to hear twice, one in the beginning and another one at the climax. Even after the end Credits start to roll, you feel it is utmost right "Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar"." 
" Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar is simple superb","The movie is really fantastic and it gives the spectators a mental boost to fight for our dreams. It teaches us that even if we are loosing the game of life, we can still succeed, if we have will power in ourselves. The songs are also superb. Udit Narayan has done the magic once again in this film. Amir Khan, as always has given his best in the movie. But Ayesha Julkha has also equaled him in all respects. I really love watching the movie. I have seen it quite a number of times. I love the songs "Pehla Nasha" and "Nahi samjhe hain woh hame". The theme of the story is fantastic. A movie which can be viewed universally by all." 
" Must see","The movie is a must see. It really came as something different from all those old masala movies. And as always ... Aamir Khan is perfect. So don't miss that." 
" Go; Get Your Bike!","I watched this movie because a friend of mine dragged me to the theater, to test if I could avoid feeling myself involved with a bicycle race that was a major part of the movie. (Now, speaking of that incident after a decade, I should perhaps replace the "watched" with "had watched", or rather, "had first watched", because later I watched this movie a few more times.)This is a very cute (I could not find another equally suitable adjective) movie that realistically depicts the life of small-town kids who belong to homes with limited means. It's a story of their pretensions and frustrations, their wish to be part of the richer folk, that of affectionate families, and of budding puppy-love. Due to very good performance by every artiste, this movie -- with a quite simple storyline -- is capable of making everyone feel part of the movie.While watching it, one is bound to get unintentionally involved with the bike race in the movie. Every heart feels warmth for Ayesha Jhulka, and everyone gets angry at Amir Khan for ignoring Ayesha's innocent and true affection. The impact of this movie could be overwhelming if one is in one's late teen or early youth. The music score was good, though I now know that the famous "Pehla Nasha" was lifted (I fail to recollect which was the original tune!).It's a very enjoyable movie, and I can not think of a reason as to why anyone should dislike it!Note: Now I found a reason why someone may dislike it: its story is taken from "Breaking Away"." 
" Nostalgia","I still won't forget those days in our childhood days when we used to die to watch such filmsJJWS a remake of Breaking Away (1979) But still those days did we care?The movie is a nice film based on sports which was rarely tackled those days The film has a nice message too and deals with all aspects like ambition, maturity.etcThe film starts off well Aamir's wayyard ways lend a many laughs and also the constant bickering between the school guys is fun to watch The reasons that make Aamir grow as a person are well handled and also the finale which makes you feel a lump go down your throat There is also the love triangle.etc which is treated wellThe film did too well that time and is still remembered as one of the best sports filmsDirection by Mansoor Khan(Cousin of Aamir) is fabulous Music was a big rage, PEHLA NASHA gave a new style of choreography to the Indian films and all songs are goodAmongst actors Aamir does his role brilliantly, The best part is he never looks he is acting, he is a natural Be it the naughty Aamir to the sensitive Aamir Ayesha Jhulka is as usual Pooja Bedi is awkward but suits her role Deepak Tijori is very good Mamik is good Khulbushan Kharbanda is adequate Don't miss Faizal Khan(in one canteen scene he is standing) and the young Imran Khan as Junior Aamir Khan" 
" One of Aamir Khans Best","Jo jeeta wohi sikandar is one of the Best Aamir Khan Movies of all time. It received the Award for the Best Film in 1993 Filmfare Awards. Aamir Khan in a young, energetic and comic role gives us another great performance. Ayesha Jhulka is not too bad of an actress, she has made a few Good films including Khiladi with Akshay Kumar. The movie also Stars long gone actress Pooja Bedi playing the role of a golddigger. This movie is 3 hours entertainment. It will appeal more to the youth, since it has a simple storyline of Love, Life and Fun. The movie is based on College life and competition and Aamir Khan is from the poorer College. Deepak Tijori is from the rich college. I grew up watching this film and have seen it almost 50 times. This is a Must See if you enjoy Aamir Khan movies" 
" Movie with Heart","This movie is different from other movies because it's not just a love story- the movie is more about action and goals. Even when you feel it is a losing battle, you can still come out a winner with enough heart and hard, hard, work. The bike race is symbolic-especially for Sanjay, who finally reaches a level of maturity and realizes what needs to be done in order to prove for himself that he can do what needs to be done along with showing his family that he is capable of doing it. His understanding of his brother matures during the movie, and in the final scene, he is shown jutting past shekhar-and achieving his goal- proving that yes, jo jeeta- wohi sikandar- the one who finishes first, is the winner- fair and square.Bottomline: This is a really good movie *****/5 stars. Also, it is probably THE Hindi movie I would recommend to people- the movie is a family film/drama that has heart and is worth watching." 
" The best sports movie ever !!!!","I was 12 when i first saw this movie...but till today i still feel the energy of the last race.. I remember taking my cycle out for long rides, putting weights in my socks and going for long rides on my cycles.The innocent love story, the bonding between friends, the equation sanju shares with his brother and dad. All so perfectly directed and shared on screen.The background score and music for the movie was truly much ahead of its time. My mom says, People used to jump of there seats in the last scenes.A must watch for all. Best Sports movie ever." 
" Much better than Breaking away","The movie is set in Dehradun in India. The movie opens with the description of the various colleges in the city. The Rajput college has students from affluent backgrounds with each student being an heir to a multimillion dollar fortune. In contrast, the Model college has students from poor local households. Other colleges include Xaviers College and Queens College, the latter being an all-girls college with the guys from all three colleges trying to woo the students there." 
" All time favourite film","I have seen this one infinitely n number of times...Best Sports film in Bollywood and a must watch if haven't seen it..."
