" Awesome compilation of random thoughts in the subconscious","The Plot The Protagonist "K" is a narcissist, self obsessed chain smoker. But I believe most smokers are narcissist to an extend. So is K, the man who spends hours in the Wash Room, to enjoy the smoke look at his well toned body and enjoy his looks, his style, rebuilding his confidence, by self assuring that "nobody tells me what to do". He takes his life for granted, when he says, no body leaves me. The question of leaving, quitting in his life has to go with his past, where his mother and father split.He is so obsessed with himself, that he is got less time to think about it. A self made cosmopolitan corporate boss, who makes things possible, with out leaving cigarette not even a moment. His name is K, because his name is K, and there is no surname, last name attributes, to add to the fact that he is self made man. His wife Anjali is a woman, who never complained, at last sticks her foot down, and asks him to quit smoking. He is referred to a clinic, Prayog Shala, which has a reputation. K decides to go to the clinic to bring back his estranged wife. He goes down the shabby "Kalkatta Karpets", a shady place where Prayog Shala is located. Bengali Baba, chief there asks him to enroll, or else die. He is got no option but to take it. The conditions put by Baba are simple. If K smokes his first Cigarette after this , his brother who is in hospital will be suffocated with cigarette smoke. Second cigarette, his fingers will be cut off. Next cigarette, his wife will die.As I was leaving from the theater, I could hear viewers puzzled comments on the movie. I am sure, more than half of the crowd didn't understand the movie. Hence writing this. As Anurag said before the release, there is only one key to understand the movie.Anurag has employed the same devices that was always incorporated by likes of David Lynch (Blue Velevet, Mullholland Drive etc.), Martin Scorsese ( After Hours), Charlie Kauffman (Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, adaptation, being John Malkavitch, etc. ) This film has nothing to do with quitting smoking. But everything to do with quitting any addiction in life. Smoking being one of the worst, yet popular addiction is difficult to kick, because of the availability of cigarettes was just chosen by him. This film is about habits, that has gotten in to us, in the subconscious, which makes us feel we need it. The inner struggle , whether for good or bad.the dream K is having is of Siberia, it represents oppression, a communist rule, where there are no individual liberty. He is the one who believes he is independent and free, and he is made to quit his individual liberty, his dream state just signifies that, the state he is in, the desperation for smoke. He will get killed if he goes for the smoke.* the Baba is a doctor, there is no Baba, he instead of the usual chemical treatment, treats K psychologically. After all smoking is more a psychological addiction * the dialog Baba says about Antaratma, is about subconscious. the struggling K we see is his subconscious, what Baba does is he is taming the subconscious, the key factor of individuality and liberty from the mind of a narcissist man, who says, no one teaches me what to do. For that fear in injected in to his mind.* there are no actual loss of ears, eyes, family, what ever. Those are fears of losing loved ones, harming them, causing harm to oneself, by smoking, there are no accident, but its what he is going through * there are no Annie, only Anjali. Annie is the guilty feeling that he has in his mind, that if he smokes he will loose her, and also the temptation to smoke. (to cheat or not to cheat one's wife) * he is forced many times to smoke, and smoking he is made to believe causes harm to his loved ones, that explains the murder of Anjali, suicide of his brother (he is made to believe that he is the cause of his brothers lung problem), etc. * the dialog I reached here through bathtub, him though Almari, signifies the subconscious of other people going through the same, similar phase * the other K inside the that dirty room, trying to reach the original K, is none other than his subconscious trying to reach him, and make him smoke, the dirt signifies many things, the smoking dirt, the suffering he is going through * remember the announcement "those who have paid full fees can go for the bath". It means the course is complete, where the subconscious is cleaned up * finally he, the subconscious, is being burnt , and finally K is relieved and treated.* the cut finger is none other than the fact that, he is missing the smoke in his had, the fingers which are cut are the ones which we use to smoke, so when he finally quit smoking, he is missing those, the only way he can get out of it is to get himself company and relief, which is why he has to enroll another person for the program.9/10.Anurag has has suspended disbelief and played with it,. there are more comments to it, explaining each and every incident, but i believe i just have to give key. please feel free to correct me, if i got any thing wrong. one more thing john Abraham has done a good job, really commendable, for the first time ever. seems all he needed was a good director" 
" Unbelievable, Classy, Abstract","There is no doubt left in my mind, that Anurag Kashyap is the next big thing in Bollywood. He is probably the best Indian director for a long time, after the great Satyajit Ray. After his controversial debut in the industry with Paanch, and Black Friday, he delivers this classy act with No Smoking. Truth be told, I was a bit skeptical about this film. A few of my friends had already had a glimpse of it and warned me against going for it, but I gave it a shot nonetheless. And I'm not complaining.No Smoking is not your traditional movie. Its not targeted to be a box office hit, because simply 9/10 people will find it stupid, boring and curse Mr.Kashyap to be a raving lunatic. But in the truest of sense, there could not have been any better addiction movie than No Smoking. We have had Requiem For a Dream, Trainspotting in Hollywood, but this the first time we have an Indian story to it. True No Smoking is even more abstract than both, but it also follows a complicated theory. One which is iterated by the Guruji(Paresh Rawal) of the Hindu knowledge of the soul, consciousness, and the Vedas.What is the basic theme of the movie is that every addiction has its core in the consciousness, the soul and we have to purify the soul in order to rid us of the addiction. The entire movie we are thrown into possibilities where the antagonist, K (John Abraham) is comprehending what is right or wrong. And that is not restricted to his addiction but all judgments in his life. Whether or not to cheat on someone's wife, or whether or not to trust someone, whether or not in his actions/inactions he is unintentionally causing anyone harm. Which is why we see he is made to believe his wife's death, his brother's suicide is his doing. But this is what his subconscious is telling him. This is what the cure is trying to tell him.The treatment that the Guruji is giving him is completely psychological. We find all the patients/relatives of the people who have been to see the "Prayogshala" is admitted to a ward which is made by the Prayogshala itself. People will misinterpret as an emotional blackmail, but in truth its cleansing the soul. We see that the antagonist feels claustrophobic at the end of the end of his dream. He says that his throat is parched and he needs a smoke, when he breaks a window and rushes to the middle of nowhere to get a smoke. The dream of Siberia, the Russian soldier shooting him(although no blood comes out) is all an indication that this is not real, its the journey of the soul, a pathway to cure of his afflictions. We find many clues to this right from the start to the end, to the point when he is desperately trying to prove to the cops that he didn't murder his wife, we find him going all ends out to prove that he is innocent, but somehow nothing works out, since HE has been living a dream, and he just woke up, so his stories are not matching up. This is something novel that Fincher did in the legendary "Fight Club"We find in the end the real K, looking out as if searching for a long lost friend, but in real he was searching for his soul, which was waiting to be cleansed, and as his soul his bathed in fire, it is cleansed and is returned to him. About the missing fingers, well everyone thought that was another torture device, but did anyone notice the fingers missing ?? They were the index finger and the middle finger, the ones we use to smoke. They are taken from the patient as a precaution. And the journey of the soul is complete only when he convinces another of his kin to undergo the same procedure, then his finger is returned to him.The movie was like I said, superb, and instead of praising any of the actors, well, this is a all in all Kashyap movie throughout. It didn't matter who was the actor, true John Abraham has done a remarkable job, but the genius that Kashyap is, made this movie so good. The direction and screenplay made this the success that it is. The script was just too good, and the sets used, (which I think were real locations actually) were also marvelous. Also the small glimpses of cheap visual effects makes it even more brilliant to show the journey of the soul. The soundtrack is also too good. Apart from the Hindi numbers exclusively for the movie, we are also treated with lots of melodious oldies starting from Frank and Nancy Sinatra to others, and to careful notice one can see that all these songs were about smoking. Paresh Rawal is also excellent in his role as the Guruji, he makes it look so easy. Ayesha Takia is again just a pretty face in this movie, without not much chance to prove herself.Lastly this review would be incomplete without a special credit to the masterful, artful Anurag Kashyap. He made a movie about a social peril, about smoking, and he made it look so easy, that it was just brilliant. He has well proved his merit over all other contemporaries. It is just pathetic that people still want to watch stupid remakes by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, irritating soap/family dramas by Karan Johar, and utter bullshit from the likes of Farah Khan, Sajid Khan when they always have options of watching brilliant stuff from this man. This perhaps is my longest review but you also don't get to see such exquisite movies such as No Smoking everyday. 9/10 !!!" 
" No Smoking - Welcome to New Age Cinema of Beauty and Class","Throw away the colorful clothes, all the expensive jewellery and welcome to realistic cinema.A theme which is hard to make a movie on, attempted by a writer/director of many realistic movies like Black Friday and Satya.What appears on the screen is true magic of a director who thinks a different way. A second of this movie cannot be missed, a minute is as good as not watching the movie.Put on your thinking caps for a movie. See, visualize, enthrall.This movie is a must-watch for those who love change, who love to think about every scene in the movie and analyze.Commercial? -- 0% value.Cinematic Experience? - 200% value.It did take me two full times to watch this movie to understand the whole concept of this movie.It did make me think 10 times before I touched my next cigarette.I applaud you Mr Anurag Kashyap. Screw the critics who slammed you." 
" The best tribute to Franz Kafka","For all those illiterates (the numbers of these great unwashed I do not doubt, it is hardly surprising that the movie bombed) who give it 1-2 stars and talk about preserving sanity, a question: Ever heard of Franz Kafka? I saw this movie just after I had read The Trial and The Castle back-to-back. It is a brilliant tribute to the genius of Kafka: I wonder that is what Anurag Kashyap intended in the first place. The plot follows the same twists and turns that one would have in a Kafka novel, particularly the descent to meet the Baba. It is not just any shady place, it is a passage from The Trial faithfully replicated: when K first approaches his accusers (note the name: another Kafka hallmark). Sheer genius. Both the original writer, and the film-maker." 
" wanna THINK deep, just watch it than!","EXCELLENT is the only word that suits on this movie, i just saw this movie in December 2010 because of the great Indian reviewers who had given such a bad comments on this movie, my friend told me again and again to watch this movie but i was always saying no to him (i thought why to watch that movie which is rated 1.5/5 in the times of India)...i was wrong with every aspect, it is a shame that i had watch this great movie so late! i loved every scene of this movie, this movie has really something to say in each and every scene, Anurag Kashyap no doubt is the best director in India who wanted to change the taste of Indian viewers and i know that he will succeed in this...storyline great, cinematography great, a big hand for Jhon and Paresh, they did the great job...a deep, dark and real concept makes confused sometimes but if you start thinking deeper you'll see that this masterpiece really has many things to say...very well done Anurag, very well done the other star cast...lastly i wanted to say that please watch this different masterpiece and you'll be surely comparing it to the Hollywood movies!" 
" No smoking is a maze","Anurag Kashyap is the wannabe maverick genius of Bollywood. (I say wannabe because the official maverick genius is Ram Gopal Varma :-). His films either do not finish, or do not get released or release years later. After the solid 'Black Friday', it was difficult to ignore his next release and so I went to watch 'No Smoking'.No Smoking is a puzzle. It is a maze through the uncharted territories in Hindi cinema. Kashyap has donned a David Lynch hat this time. He unpacks a bag of questions on the screen for you which you have to find answers for yourself. And that, he backs up with excellent technical support from all other departments, so that you are not distracted in your search for answers.I'll be honest. I did not really understand the film but I guess that is the way Kashyap wants it to be. He wants me to unravel the layers of the film as and when I have time. In that process, when I'd have soaked myself thoroughly in 'No Smoking', I'll let it go, not caring to be bothered by it anymore. Just like K (John Abraham's character) does to his cigarette.a) Is cigarette a metaphor for all the things we lust for which only destroy us at the end? (I'm reminded of the line from 'Pulp Fiction' where Bruce Willis' girl friend tells him how things that are good to touch are not good to look at, referring to a pot belly) b) Is Paresh Rawal's character actually God? Is he the villain because he does not let us pursue our lust and plays by his rules - rules which cannot be bent or broken? c) In the end, does someone always have to really loose his soul and conscience? Can this world no go round if everyone owns his soul till the end?I don't know if these are the questions that No Smoking asks. But it did force me to think of these.The film is a technical accomplishment. The camera work, the set designs and graphics are all top notch. Tin cans were stacked up to create amazing visuals (you don't always need Switzerland :-). Music is in tune with the film and Gulzar, as always, has written lyrics that are sign-posts in this maze. Kudos also to Kumar Mangat and Vishal Bharadwaj for having the guts to produce such a film.John Abraham is good. He always manages to do well in caught-on-all-sides characters. Paresh Rawal shines in his role. It was a relief to see him at some place other than a mindless Priyadarshan muddle.No Smoking, no doubt, is at par technically with the best in the world but sadly enough, it has very little conventional entertainment value. It may be one of the milestones that Kashyap had to cross in his path to higher glories." 
" Very dark, but subtle....","You read thru the comments here, either its in 8-9-10 range or its in 1-2-3 range. Its funny to see the movie invokes such drastic reactions in different people. That itself talks a lot about the cinematic power of this masterclass movie of "A", (Anurag Kashyap).To some extent, its a director's indulgence. He didn't make the movie for you or me, he made it for himself. It's a movie made for film school. The movie can be a textbook for various film-making subjects. Technically brilliant! A very dark movie indeed, probably first movie of the film-noir kind to be made from Bollywood stable. Anurag Kashyap is a sort of rebel in the industry. I am glad he was able to express himself cinematically through this movie.Honestly, its really hard to understand the movie. And I didn't quite follow it either. But somehow, I really enjoyed watching it.Vishal Bharadwaj produced it - who else but another master of dark movies will understand this movie.Vishaal's music is infectious in the movie. He surprises me with his never-ending creativity. Musically I associated him with Omkara, Maachis type music, mellow, neo-classical, haunting. But his experimentation with Jazz in this movie is truly outstanding. Apart from the songs, the movie SHOULD get recognition for its background score. Deep rooted in jazz, I had to rewind the movie several times to listen to some background jazz scores. What else Vishaal has in store for us??? Its interesting to get a piece of director A's mind through his blog, where he really expresses himself, go to passionforcinema.com to read his blog. If you are anywhere close to film-making, you will love reading his writings.Anurag Kashyap is a different class of movie director. I am not sure if he can make much money trying to follow his passion, because it is very hard to get accepted with this kinda movies. However, I wish he make a few semi-commercial movies to give him the money to experiment with true gems like No Smoking. Last thing I want him to be branded as a crazy lunatic of the bollywood.Bravo Mr Kashyap!!" 
" Itzz different","I watched this movie once and couldn't resist myself from watching it again only 10 mins later. A black metaphor of life, which poses some serious questions to the thinking mind. Lust, and how far can you go to pursue your lust? What if some supernatural entity is destined to stop you from committing the lust? And what if the darker side of nature forces you to commit it? Questions answered and many others unanswered.. this is a movie brilliantly crafted; though at times the pace is slackened. And who says its a copy of the Game? The questions this movie asks and forces us to think is totally different from the game. The treatment of this movie is very different, but i am afraid this difference will become too much for the general audience to grasp or to digest.Kudos to you Anurag Kashyap, for giving hungry people like me ( those who have hunger for watching movies which are a class apart) a classic movie to feast upon, on the risk of losing most of your other customers." 
" Crazily Abstract.. Unbelievably Brilliant","It is one of the few movies that is a mix of intended stupidity, sarcasm and at the same time a great use of the plot. The movie starts off with things that you can readily digest to be possible, but things become hazy and unreal as the movie proceeds, making you feel that Kashyap has slipped somewhere. But the process of the story reveals that nothing in the movie is real or unreal, for a question of possibility to arise, and you are left with a lot of questions with many possible answers, none seeming right or wrong.The most common aspect of any abstract movie is the fact that at some point before the end the director tells you what the whole movie was about. The whole abstractness is broken or justified in the end. But 'No Smoking' takes that a few dimension higher. Every now and then it gives you a feeling that you have been able to look through the director and break into the story. And every time it leaves you more devastated. To make things better, or worse i don't know, the end gives you a feeling that you have finally cracked the mystery and you feel proud of yourself, and reach cloud nine. But Kashyap takes no time to push you back to earth, and you fall so hard that it leaves you with no option but to appreciate the sheer brilliance of the director.Overall its a delight for someone who looks for more that a story or a perfect ending in a movie." 
" Simply amazing","'No Smoking' is a masterpiece. It embodies so many ideas, every scene, every frame giving you a clue about the whole, leaving messages in pieces that for a normal 'entertainment' seeking audience, it becomes a challenge.The director challenges the audience to give up their passive viewing and think, decipher what goes on with the protagonist K. The movie is full of metaphors and clues, the people here represent ideas/ideals. For example, smoking and K's addiction to smoking is equivalent to freedom and a person's passion to work with freedom. The rehab center, Baba Bengali and K's friends who send him to quit smoking are the 'system'. Everyone complies and obeys the system without asking themselves what 'they' the individual wants. The system makes sure that everyone complies fully without even a hint of opposition...(symbolically represented by 'cutting fingers' and torturing family members...if u fail to quit smoking). Inspite of everything, if you dare to 'desire', your spirit is cleansed. That is evident in the last ten minutes, when K's real self, is across the glass wall crying as he sees himself without the soul, without the freedom to desire...just a spineless body that has submitted to the system.There are many other clues and interpretations, but I think these are the more obvious ones. Wrote specifically for the people who complained they failed to make a 'head' or 'tail' out of the film. The director, Anurag Kashyap believes that the Indian audience is 'spoon-fed' and looking at reviews and people's reaction to 'No-Smoking', its no wonder that everyone wants to stay away from it. They would rather remain 'spoon-fed' than grow up.An amazing piece of art..the first of its kind to be ever made in India." 
" Brilliant, daring, unconventional...",""No Smoking" is the most brilliant,daring,unconventional film ever to come out of Bollywood. It could have been written by Franz Kafka or begotten by Stephen King upon John Grisham. John Abraham is outstanding as the arrogant selfish Indian yuppie "K", a Kafka hero if there ever was one. When his bullied wife leaves him, he's referred by a peculiar friend and his own peculiar family doctor to a mysterious clinic that guarantees he can kick his most nasty habit, smoking. The clinic turns out to be a nightmarish set-up (The Firm) from which there is no back-sliding without dire consequences. "K", the master of all he surveys immediately rebels and brings down hellish results upon himself and his family. The viewer is jolted along on this queasy and horrific experience just as is "K". Will "K" ultimately kick his "habit" and eradicate much of his personality along with it....will "K" become a model "Stepford" husband? Watch this disturbingly entertaining allegorical fable and find out!" 
" Vivid. Unreal. Stunning. Abstract art at its best.","Hmmm so didn't we think "abstract art" is a term coined to be used only for paintings or photographs or at best sculptures or any form of art that is static? Whenever we thought of an abstract cinema, most of us would start and stop at Shyam Benegal.But Anurag Kashyap with his latest film, changes lots of definitions and perceptions. No doubt Shayam Benegal brand of cinema is one of the USPs of Indian film Industry. But usually in that brand of cinema you could see through Director's brain by the end. You could make out what was the film maker trying to portray. But Anurag Kashyap keeps his card close to his chest till the end. It's hard to define if it was a good thing to do or bad. But the fact remains that there would be numerous questions in your mind after watching this film with various possible answers and none of the answer being totally right or totally wrong. This is peak of vivid imagination. This is stuff dreams are made of.Anurag, the director of highly rated Black Friday, shows that there is an intelligent film maker in there who dares to think away from ordinary. This bold attempt may not fetch him commercial success every time, but one thing is for sure that we have a film maker who makes film he believes in and not for making money. This is a good sign for Indian cinema. He gives a new dimension to Art Cinema. Every few reels, you can feel proud that you have got to the crux of the events going on screen, you can soar sky high. But then suddenly you realize that you don't have wing, the film takes an unimaginative new turn and you are left where you started.With stunning cinematography, amazing art work, superb direction and high class acting, this certainly is an experience of its own kind. John Abraham looks sexy with his hot 6 packs. Paresh Rawal is as good as it gets. Ayesha Takia is decent.Don't try to find or infuse any sense or logic of your own, just watch what is shown, be it lady singing in Adnan Sami's voice or a bath tub in Siberia opening in underground world in Mumbai, and you might like the ride." 
" Ahead Atleast 50 years of its actual time of release","One of the best hindi movie

" Lynchish puzzle on Bollywood screen","For Bollywood movie-goers who haven't seen NO SMOKING, this is my recommendation This is weird movie. Watch it at your own risk. For those who expect an anti-smoking movie about how to give up smoking...PLEASE DON'T WATCH IT. But if you like any or all of the following movies, DO watch this movie: LostHighway, FWWM, BartonFink, Kafka, Jacob's Ladder. Movies like Matrix, Spider, Memento, Fight Club, Adaptation-dole out the solution to the puzzle in real time-on the screen which the average viewer can follow. And then... there are movies like NO SMOKING, LOST HIGHWAY, MULHOLLAND DR., FWWM, & INLAND EMPIRE.. which do not give you all the answers. You'll have to figure out the movie in your head after the last frame has played. Instead of showing Langdon follow the clues to crack the code... you will be given the clues to be your own Langdon.Loosely based on King's Quitter's Inc., NO SMOKING is a story of a man's struggle against his addiction and ego.***Spoilers Ahead*** This is what you see on the screen... K is an arrogant, self-obsessed, businessman. He chain-smokes probably because of a disturbed childhood... some crap between parents, who keep getting married and divorced. His wife Anjali threatens to leave unless he quits smoking. He is recommended to this rehab program in the slums of Dharavi at a "Prayogshala", where Shri Shri Prakash Guru Ghantal Baba Bangali threatens severe bodily harm to him and his family for every cigarette that he smokes.K's arrogance lets all hell loose on him. The BABA's spies are everywhere... (Ram, Shyam, Balram) and K cannot smoke a cigarette without the BABA coming to know about it. K keeps waking up from bizarre nightmares, which have consequences in the real world. K loses his hearing, brother dies in a weird accident/suicide, K loses his fingers (awesome :P), wife is killed & K ends up in the "Prayogshala" where he cannot take a bath until he pays the 1 re that he owes the BABA. In the last scene, we see K recommending this program to his other mate in order get his fingers back.And here is my take on the film... K - the arrogant, addicted guy with the not-so-stable childhood and a marriage soon-to-turn into a divorce goes to the "Prayogshala" and that is where the reality ends and nightmares/ hallucinations begin. The "Prayogshala" brainwashes K to-the-extreme,leading him into believing whatever we see on screen.Here is what Anurag had to say about his movie post the release  "..it is a film about arrogance.. of two kinds..why I made it , the way I made it, the reasons I have never discussed it before.. it is my most personal movie.. I am K.. K's arrogance is the obvious arrogance, that everyone sees everyday.. he smokes..he breathes nicotine.. He says NOBODY tells me what to do.. I breathe cinema.. and forever everyone has been telling me not to make the kind of cinema I do.. NO SMOKING is a tale of an arrogant man and another who is much more arrogant, who lives in his world, where he controls everything and he thinks he is morally superior to any existing humans, he is the kind of man who thrives on minorities and underprivileged, he worships the dictatorial attitude and all he wants from you is to lose your soul and convert.it,s a tale about an arrogant man's descent into morality.. and the architecture of the moral world is so absurd that it sometimes beats reality..""GIVE ME THE LIBERTY TO KNOW, TO UTTER, TO ARGUE FREELY ACCORDING TO MY CONSCIENCE ABOVE ALL LIBERTIES... Since, I do not have the liberty, and I get banned every time I am directly stating my opinions, one has to wage a guerrilla war.. no smoking is my guerrilla war.. and in the end the man loses to the system and the only way he can survive is after having lost his soul (freedom).. everyone expects a good versus evil film, where good wins over evil, where the end sums it up, and all is well at the end.. well it doesn't happen here.. here K doesn't want to, but never comes to know how and when he gave in to the system, but accepts it and starts to do what his own people did to him..why? in order to survive.. why his treatment becomes an incomprehensible nightmare, because it does in real life, I am the living proof. This film is just the treatment the powerful (Baba Bangali) puts K (the man whose allusions are of greatness, seemingly invincible) through to bring him over to his side and manages.. there is nothing more.. "Here are things I like about the movie.... Great cinematography, the loose inspirations- Quitters Inc., the dwarf (remember Lynch's FWWM), the symbolisms... and of course, this is an important piece of cinema... the first of its kind in Bollywood history. Here is where I expected more from the movie... Lynch movies like Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr., or INLAND EMPIRE have a lot of shock value, beauty and bizarreness besides the puzzle that is put forward for us. All these elements enhance the entertainment value of the movie and viewers end up loving the movie despite failing to solve the puzzle. Anurag failed in doing this. The script could have used more work... e.g. including elements that would make more meaning on repeated viewings... remember Matrix... Lastly, the background score could have used a lot more work to give the movie a different mood.To sum it up... Lovers of Gen-X surreal cinema should definitely watch this movie despite its flaws.Must notice Trivia... BTW... did you notice the transparent imp... that was always around in BABA's basement... ALSO.. did u notice Anurag in the elevator with John... The B/W scenes with laughter track were heavily inspired by Oliver Stone's NBK..." 
" the best Hindi movie ever","for the past one year i have been avoiding Hindi movies..mainly for the reason that these movies have failed to strike a chord neither with my heart nor with my brain...but this movie brings my faith right back into Hindi...i have read many negative reviews about this movie,but i somehow felt that the movie must have something in it to provoke such a reaction,so i finally saw it to find out...yes this is one of the movies in which you will think u have solved the puzzle and the next moment u will be disappointed that this is not the correct solution,and you will be made to think again... and yes this movie has many possible interpretations,this is the most brilliant thing about this movie....this is a David lynch kind of a movie,but it somehow seems to have really struck a chord even more than lynch movies...the acting was absolutely perfect,they did not overact,they did not underact!Paresh Rawal's character was very strong....man this person can act,you will listen to him,even if you don't understand a single word of what he is speaking! then there ...another gem of a performance,and john Abraham....no one could have done the role better except may be Christian bale or tom cruise..he has that suave look and narcissist approach which was needed for the role!the ambiance created by the director..the BM music,the brilliant camera angles,the creation of those really dark and mysterious situations and places,the plot(or the lack of it,which was absolutely perfect,the presence of a solid plot would have spoiled the experience) ,the screenplay(brilliantly done,specially the dreams)...the premise of the movie is 'smoking'..the protagonist K,is a chain smoker and his wife leaves him for that,then provoked by two of his friends he joins a organization to leave his smoking...but then his suffering starts..now i wont move any further...because i will be spilling spoilers!! it provokes a deep anti-smoking sentiment in the viewer....if this movie had been promoted properly it would have made it to the IMDb 250...." 
" a tribute to abstract cinema","after the devastating black Friday, director Anurag Kashyap is back with yet another film, this time roughly based on a Stephen king novel quitters inc. no smoking is a film which is not meant for everyone, in fact the number of people who will find this movie engaging is very few and far between. the central character of the film "K" is addicted to smoking which becomes the worrying point for his wife Anjali who threatens him that she would think of divorce if he doesn't think of leaving smoking. helpless he decides to go into a rehabilitation center, who's process of making smokers quit is a bit unconventional to say the least. what happens after that should not be revealed. the movie has some brilliant visual effects, excellent cinematography and strong direction for most of the part. john Abraham pulls of a difficult role pretty well though he has a long way to go before he can boast of his acting skills. there are flaws in the film and for which it would fail to get an audience in most places, the director of the film takes it's audience for granted, he is so busy in showing off his genius that he forgets about the people for whom he is making this movie. the result is the bizarre puzzling ending. in all this film is one that avoids traditional Bollywood clichés and is fresh in its story,look and treatment. Just on final word of advise for the director, at the time when Indian new wave cinema is again starting to grow, lets all just not make different movies but lets all make good movies."
