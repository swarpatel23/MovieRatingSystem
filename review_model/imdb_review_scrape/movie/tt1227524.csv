" Fascinating Tale without any unwanted masala","It does not surprise me that the so-called critics did not think much of this movie. I think it's just the times we're living in - movies such as Aashayein fare poorly at the box office because majority of the people neither have the patience nor have the IQ to watch such movies.This is the 3rd movie of John Abraham I have watched after Kabul Express and New York, and he has just continued to show what a tremendous actor he is. Despite his other masala movies, he seems to find an off-beat movie and leaves his mark. Anaitha Nair acted excellently in a role that was very different than her role in Chak De India. She fit greatly in her role of a hospice patient. Supporting cast of Farida Jalal and Girish Karnad filled in their roles well.The little boy Ashwin Chitale's role was mystic and portrayed well. Music was by and large melodious and lyrics were fresh (change to today's bollywood junk). Ab Mujhko Jeena, Shukriya Zindagi, Chala Aya Pyar were the best tracks and rest were good too.I'm rating this movie 10/10 easily simply based on the fact that I can watch it again. Must see for serious movie fans that enjoy a strong story line and sensible movies." 
" Painful to watch a great movie","Out of the many shiny bollywood masalla action packed, brainless plots and pointless movies, here comes a treat to watch. John Abraham is getting better everyday in bollywood and I assume the day is not far when he will stand with the top line of bollywood. I don't know but he is the only actor I feel who gives a strange feeling of belongingness to the masses. Anyway ! About the movie.. It's a story of a dying man and his experiences after wards. (Full Stop! Find out the whole of it in the movie). This is a very touchy and sensitive subject and the way it was portrayed in the movie is the brilliance of the Production team. No fun intended, no typical bollywood happy-happy moments, Its a movie with hard facts and human emotions and PAIN. It's a difficult movie to watch because of the pain and hopelessness it carry. Throughout the movie you will be in pain and misery for the characters. And that credit goes to non other then John himself and the new talent portrayed in the character of Padma. They managed to transfer the agony to the viewers and that's the 'job-done'. With out a doubt this is the best ever performance by john Abraham as he himself claimed it in a TV show interview recently that people would be stunned to see the performance and they sure do! The music number 'shukrya zindagi' is very well pasted in the film at different moments when 'needed' (no pointless bollywood songs at least in this movie). And why an 8 for a movie which deserves at least 9? Yeah the Indiana Johnes segments (Dreams). This would have been a much better treat to watch without those scenes and the story should have focused more on the realities of life, but anyway still no hard feelings for a great movie. By the way this is not your weekend reliever and a pop corn flick!! As a whole it's a very serious movie and not many people would like to watch it (sorry for that John). But those who have a taste of such movies would definitely remember this one for a long time. Aashayein.. Yeah!" 
" very depressing","I watched this movie because I like John Abraham and kind of liked some of it's songs, and I am literally thrilled after watching this movie. I agree that many things didn't go well in this movie like writing part, cinematography part and in some of the scenes acting was clumsy too but the overall impact of the movie was very intense. I don't know that is it a rumor but some of the sources claimed that John and Nagesh Kuknoor(director) didn't charge at all for this movie as the subject was beyond economics. Padma(Anaitha Nair) was the cream of the movie and she enlightened the screen every time she appeared, I hope she will get more project like this. Sonal Sehgal got the more publicity then Anaitha Nair although her appearance and impact was low, and I personally enjoyed the on-screen chemistry between John and Anaith. I recommend this movie as a must watch movie for everyone as it has a great message and elements concerning everyone" 
" Nagesh is Back ..Thank God !","Well, the last two flicks of Nagesh were a gross disappointment. But, not this time. He has come back to his forte, that of, sensitive and touching cinema. John has given his best till date and the seventeen year old Anitha was outstanding.The story revolves the last few days of a lung cancer patient. The way he deals with his pain, his isolation and paradox of life. In this process he discovers that he needs a purpose in life which is shown by a child who resembles a monk. Slowly he discovers, instead of gloating and wasting life, he devotes himself for the happiness of others. There are frequent references to Karma and the hidden messages are nicely conveyed through this film. He uses his surplus of funds for the fulfillment of desires of his friends and thus kind of liberating them. The parallel story of Indiana Jones is well woven and strikes a parallel to the needs of the protagonist.The films ends on a positive note and the protagonist still seeking a new adventure.The music is outstanding with the same team as that of Dor. It Blends very well with the situations and embellishes the movies further.All in All ! Nagesh is Back ! Looking for further great movies from him." 
" A Story of hope, fulfilled","Aashayein is a story of hope. A story of hope fuulfilled by Nagesh Kukunoor. The main character of the movie are John, Anaitha and Sonal. John a compulsive gambler is the boyfriend of Sonal. By a sudden twist of events he wins a jackpot worth 3 million rupees and decides to have a blast. Suddenly he realizes that he isn't going to live long and has only a few days to live. Till this part the movie is very traditional and several other makers have tried movie on similar theme.He doesn't want to die specially when he sees the face of his girlfriend. So he runs away from his home and goes to a place in remote location in Pondichery where people go to spend the last part of their lives. The hospital has got people from several parts of lives all of whom have got one thing in common, everybody knows they would die one day and don't hesitate to discuss infront of each other. Girish Karnad a retired banker, Farida Jalal a high class prostitute, Govinda the gift of god, Anaitha a 17 year old arrogant but lively cancer patient all are a part of this hospital. They laugh, they party, they enjoy life like any other normal humans.John decides to fulfil all inmates last wish and asks each of them to give in writing their last wish. One by one, all their last wish is fulfilled only except Padma who wishes to be made love by John.John in a heart touching performance will touch stratight your soul. His sincere acting will never make you believe that he is acting. A must watch movie for all those peoples who wants to watch a good movie." 
" What a Touching Film","Sensitively portrayed. This movie was very moving and clearly one of John Abraham's best performances ever. I loved the theme: there is hope even in the face of dying. Loved Padma (Anahita Nair) and Govinda (young messenger of god) because they both gave John's character reasons to live. This movie will bring tears to your eyes, so bring the tissue box - you will need it." 
" living while dying!","Movie seems to be a low budget movie.But i like the fact that there are no villains in this movies, at least physically. This movies is a great example to show how much fragile life is. Here 'Indy' get struck by fortune and disaster at the same time.Whole movie is an emotional roller coaster while the main character struggles through his own illness and also struggle to cope with the deaths of his fellow mates. Movie has a good ending which make the audience think about life in a different prospective.For me character 'Padma' was the main attraction where she enlighten the sad mood in the movie with her stubborn and obnoxious behavior.I think everyone should watch this movies to understand life on prospective of people who already try to live while they are obviously dying. thank you!" 
" Well made flick . though could have been better .","Watched Aashayein (2010) movie today .. Directed by Nagesh Kukunoor . Worth a watch .. though boring few times ... The movie still sends a strong message of living life with a meaning . And the music also is awesome . All the supporting actors play their parts very well . So credit also goes to them for a good performance . Acting by John Abraham is really good . Loved the music . Background score is decent . But Anaitha Nair , who portrays Padma steals the show . A really good performance by her . All in all a decent family entertainer . But the magic that Nagesh created through Iqbal is certainly missing . So 9/10 for the movie ...." 
" Aashayein - The world lives on hope","Terminal illness is a depressing subject. Venturing into that territory is generally abstained. On that note, Hrishida's "Anand" and Mani Rathnam's "Geetanjali" feature in my top-of-mind-recall. Though both depressing but great writing pushed it high on entertainment quotient. Of course fantastic performances, sub-plots, auxiliary characters and the rich music add flesh to the bones. "Aashayein" is is Mr. Kukunoor's ode to both classics (and very subtly he fits in the "Anand" bit into the story). ☼ John Abraham:: Perhaps his best performance till date. This time around you will certainly see an actor behind the good looks and the dimpled cheeks. About the character, I wasn't completely convinced with the compulsive gambler bit. He could have simply been rich carefree and cool character. ☼ Anaitha Nair:: Every terminal illness story warrants a character depicting "live life kingsize". This time around it is Anaitha Nair. She pours her heart out to breathe life into the character of Padma (paradoxical statement indeed!). The writing deserves a special mention. ☼ Sonal Sehgal:: Doesn't get enough scope as Anaitha Nair steals the thunder practically right under everyone's noses. Nearly gets relegated to "miss-goody-two-shoes" had her character was not resurrected in the penultimate moments. ☼ Girish Karnad:: Under-utilised.☼ Farida Jalal:: Under-utilised again. And perhaps a younger actress should have been chosen for the role in question. ☼ Prateekha Lonkar:: Not enough meat in the role. ☼ Vikram Inamdar:: Nagya's lucky mascot from "Hyderabad Blues" gets a compassionate but short role. ☼ Elahe:: Another lucky mascot in a blink-and-miss role. I particularly found that the sub-plots did not get enough screen time to be fleshed out (reference to Girish Karnad & Farida Jalal).Music was not promoted adequately. Shreyas Talpade's special appearance was not warranted, in fact John Abraham should have done it for greater impact. Though the response was a mixed bag, I particularly found the "Indiana Jones" layer complimenting neatly to the character of John Abraham. "Aashayein" has suffered a great deal owing to the rift between the makers. Lack of promotions marred the recognition it rightfully deserves. And last but not the least, Nagesh is a well-rounded entertainer and no questions to that. Having said that, it is my opinion that he should let go the writing department and channel his creative abilities to deliver goods of his standards on a more frequent basis." 
" AASHAYEIN : Nagesh is back with a worth watching film having only few avoidable glitches.","As far as the story plot is concerned, AASHAYEIN may not have anything new to say to the viewers. But talking about its fresh treatment, the movie does have few worth mentioning merits in its kitty which rightly differentiate it from all the previous ones made around this particular subject.If we look back, then all the films revolving around a dying person made by many famous directors in the past, have two things in common. Firstly it's the fun element incorporated in them which lightens the mood of the viewer throughout the film, till it reaches its climax. Before coming to the concluding moments every such venture first makes you smile with few hilarious or enjoyable moments and then leads you towards the end, talking about the ultimate death of the hero. Secondly, all those movies have never been too verbal on the subject of death. If you can recall, their characters always talk about the most certain truth in a very subtle way without any strong offensive or direct dialogues in a sheer poetic kind of mood.AASHAYEIN breaks all these preset modes of the subject and takes you into a more bitter, hard hitting and truthful kind of arena where every character clearly knows that he has to die in few months and they don't feel shy or uncomfortable talking about it freely with each other. All the key characters of the script live under one roof, getting their decent daily life facilities while waiting for their final moments to arrive any time. And it's the interaction between these different dying people in the film, which transforms it into a worth watching venture, dissimilar to anything you have seen before.Especially the sequences between John Abraham and Anaitha Nair, which are beautifully written and superbly enacted by the talented duo. The verbal expressions of Anaitha when she talks about her experiences within and outside the help-house are simply a treat to watch. In fact, death has never been expressed so freely on Indian screen before as done by Anaitha in AASHAYEIN. In short she gives the most explosive performance of the movie which deserves to be seen as a must.Apart from John-Anaitha's brilliant on-screen chemistry, the movie has some highly enlightening scenes featuring Farida Jalal, Girish Karnad, Sonal Sehgal and a charming child actor Ashwin Chitale. Here I would like to mention a dialogue which has never been used before in a movie on the same theme, where in Sonal explains her trauma to John saying, "Your pain gets over within few days when you would be gone, but what about us, the people you will leave behind. How are we suppose to live with this pain all our life?" Indeed a well written thought put in by the writers.John Abraham being the central character surprises you with an honest and heartfelt performance. After the few initial moments, you just forget about his killing looks and star status and start believing in his pain as he easily establishes an emotional relationship with the viewers. Undoubtedly he delivers a performance he can always feel proud of. Other than the main lead, Nagesh extracts some great performances from his entire supporting cast (including himself in a cameo) and with this; he once again proves his mastery over the medium when it comes to emotional and sensitive subjects.Salim Suleiman's music works as you are watching the movie, but the song featuring Shreyas Talpade as the rock band leader remains the one in your mind while walking out of the theater. And Shreyas is also equally good performing it on the screen. Another merit of the movie remains its Cinematography which captures both the indoors and the outdoors fantastically. Now let's talk about the main avoidable glitch in the movie which serves as a big unwanted interruption in its otherwise smooth progression. Here I am referring to all those sequences in the film wherein John imagines himself as Indiana Jones leading to some strange dream sequences inside a cave where there are many white faced ghosts tied in thick chains. The relationship of the dream with the reality was fine but why it was used in such a length was quite weird and out of my understanding as it hampered the overall impact of the film on its audience.Along with this big mistake, Nagesh also uses another half baked and unexplained character in his script who gets no justification of any sort right till the end. This refers to the character of a small child who is shown to have some magical healing powers in his body. Now whether he really had some powers., if yes then how did he actually benefit John with his powers in the end remains a mystery.So, in all AASHAYEIN could have been a much better and highly appreciated movie in absence of The Indiana Jones character in its script. It certainly has its own highly commendable moments to watch and learn from. But minus all those dream sequences it surely would have impressed a lot more people in the theaters as well as in the industry. Still it didn't deserve to be canned for more than a year for whatsoever reasons. Regarding its box office prospects, the chances are not so bright as today's busy generation is simply not interested in seeing a movie revolving around the theme of Death, unless there is a Shahrukh, Aamir, Salman or Hrithik dying on the screen. But I would really like to recommend it to my readers, for the effortless performance put in by Anaitha Nair and its few not to be missed enlightening moments, capable of teaching some new lessons of life to all of us." 
" A good film could be bit better, but John proves his talent","It was Iqbal that got Nagesh Kukunoor noticed though he did quality work prior to it like 3 Deewarein and Hyderabad Blues. In between Nagesh made Tasveer which was a disaster Aashayein was stuck for 2 years and released in 2010, The film may have released just after No Smoking(2007) when John was trying experimental stuff. In the film again John plays a chain smoker who gets lung cancer Though the hospital shown is hardly authentic but yet the moments he shares with Anaitha Nair are warm and welcoming, however the put off is the Indiana Jones chapter, Donno why Nagesh chose to focus so much on it? Otherwise the film is well made though it went unnoticed.Direction by Kukunoor is fab though the writing could be better Music is okayJohn Abraham often known as a one dimensional actor however he has proved earlier in No Smoking and several films that he has lot of untapped talent, here he takes full advantage and delivers a fantastic performance, he also lost weight(16 kilos) and it shows Sonal Sehgal is good, Anaitha Nair is perfect and simply mindblowing Farida Jalal is good, Girish Karnad after Iqbal is fab, rest are decentFor trivia buffs, There is also a reference to Hyderabad Blues, A band is shown with that name." 
" Dreams Should Never Die","After the horrendous '8 x 10 Tasveer', Nagesh Kukunoor is back on track. Even though I was a bit skeptical seeing that Kukunoor has been going downhill since 'Bombay to Bangkok' and the casting of John Abraham in the lead role didn't sound very promising but I was wrong. 'Aashayein' is a heartfelt down-to-earth little film about a young man who, after being diagnosed with cancer, admits himself to a hospice, leaving behind the life he once knew (that includes a fiancée), only to find a new one. The premise sounds familiar but don't be fooled. This isn't another 'Anand' or 'Dasvidaniya'. Yet, Kukunoor doesn't shy away from showing who he's influenced by as he wisely makes references to classics like 'Anand' and 'Indiana Jones'. The Indiana Jones dream sequences are quite well executed. The songs, including the Shreyas Talpade item number, fit in well.The setting of the hospice is quite beautiful. Hindi films usually depict hospitals and other medical centres as this cold, impersonal place where the ill are ignored or treated without affection. Thankfully Kukunoor sheds a positive light and hopefully there are more such options for people in India. In addition, I also liked how Kukunoor briefly depicts the struggle encountered by the medical staff in order to run the place.John Abraham's performance may not be flawless but it's the best work he's done to date. Hot Sonal Sehgal has good screen presence. Girish Karnad, Prateeksha Lonkar and Farida Jalal provide great support. I would have liked to see more of the lovely Jalal as her character was very interesting. Finally, the star of 'Aashayein' is Anaitha Nair who steals every scene she's in with a commendable performance. I would like to see more of this actress cast in such significant roles in good films.'Aashayein' may have its share of flaws but it manages to win the heart of the viewer and I hope, from this movie on, Kukunoor stays on track instead of stumbling with the likes of '8 x 10 Tasveer'." 
" Underrated and Unknown Gem of a Movie","Hardly anyone knows about this movie, but those who have watched it can only say good things this about the film.
the theme of hope amidst counting down days to death may not be new, but it certainly portrays the emotions and journey in a manner that touches every person.
It is a small budget wonder. Put it in the top of your watchlist." 
" amazing","Aashayein- ﻿one of the best John movie i have ever seen ..everytime I cried when I watched this movie... one of the best John movie... love songs too.no words..The movie sends a strong message of living life with a meaning.treat to watch..This is a very touchy and sensitive subject and the way it was portrayed in the movie is the brilliance of the Production team. No fun intended, no typical Bollywood happy-happy moments, Its a movie with hard facts and human emotions and PAIN. It's a difficult movie to watch because of the pain and hopelessness it carry.Excellent work by John & Nagesh. No words...!!!﻿" 
" Aashayein and Expectations","Aashayein and ExpectationsIt's a movie where reality meets fantasy. Nagesh Kukunoor have always dealt real issues in a very subtle ways and showcased us the true beauty behind the camera. Be it Dor, Iqbal or Hyderabad Blues' the story lines were greatly woven with camera-work and screenplay. Aashayein lacked in story and screenplays. But kukunoor knows how to extract the performances from the casts.The moment the protagonist wears the cowboy's hat of Harrison Ford and lands into Ark full of Ghosts, the story looked childish. Before this turn, the first half is worth watching and it was touching the nerves. Soon the contact with emotional aspect got lost and a thrill ride happened. The entire human aspect of the movie lost its meaning.The Movie opened with a very great camera and a real betting zone where one easily win some 3 crore Rupees. Another marvelous moment followed with a small party and a proposal. The Director didn't spend much time telling you the dilemma the movie is going to deal. After all you need money to die too...Enter Hospice, where the death is not serious and looked like a filmi- set. Sonal Sehgal looked efficiently beautiful. Nagesh was sure that this girl does not need a makeup to be more beautiful. Her performances were carried well. Anita Nair as an obnoxious kid was brilliant with a Wiggy effect. The last wish was something one could die for. She got some good lines along with Girish Karnad. This Chak de girl was brilliant than the famous self. The only weak character was of Farida Jalal, whose role and acting didn't do any justice with an HIV infected person, she was eating well and shown well without any hint of AIDS. John was chosen because of the innocence and carrying beard. However his cigarettes and holding ashes over them looked quite amateurish. Abraham did his bit with an effort; he was good in eating mangoes and impersonating Ford. The small child avatar with big eyes and hanging teeth was amazing and a beautiful story teller.Like always, this movie had a happy ending. A low budget film with promises not delivered as it should be. There was not a single scene stealer in this movie where one needs to hold back his tears. There was even a tribute to Hrishikesh mukherjee.The beach song was unnecessary and worst among the lot. Salim-Suleiman music was catapulted to touch emotional strings.Kukunoor need to stick to his blue satire and the realistic movies where we don't see any fantasies.No need to take it to the Heart."
