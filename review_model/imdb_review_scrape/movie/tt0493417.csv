" a movie for fools mostly","What a boring pretentious piece of ripoff! Yes, 'Fool N Final' is a very poor ripoff of 'Snatch'. Direction is very amateurish. Sound effects are abysmal. Performances sucked. Vivek Oberoi is funny at parts and sucks otherwise. Sunny Deol sucks (as he does in all his films since 1994). Shahid Kapoor seems to confuse acting with exposing his teeth and pretending to say a few words. Sharmila Tagore is wasted. Could Sameera Reddy look more uninterested? Ayesha Takia seems to enjoy fluttering her eyelashes. Chunkey Pandey seems to think talking in a cringe-inducing voice is acting. Om Puri is wasted too. Direction is amateurish. What a whole lot of bore! I at least expected a few laughs and this crap didn't even provide me that!" 
" Pathetic way of coping a movie","I have seen a lot of Indian movies which were copied from some real good Hollywood movies. Some though they were copies of Hollywood movies but still worth a watch. Like Kante (a mixture of Usual Suspect, Reservoir Dogs and heat), Musafir (a mixture of Confidence and U-Turn) and a lot of other titles. But this movies which is one of the most pathetic copy of Snatch. Most of these B rated directors they go to a DVD store, watch the movies and translate it in there own language to make a new movie. Well anybody who has not seen this movie i will suggest don't waste your money. If you have seen snatch and liked it you will be really disappointed to watch this. Somebody should inform Guy Richie about this mockery. I definitely believe that most of the actors in this movies have seen Snatch what i can't understand is how do they agree to such a non-sense. Well only one more thing for everybody in bollywood They should try to do some original work cox that's what they are good at. Stop ripping others ideas and embarrassing yourself by making such crap." 
" Utter rubbish!!","Rubbish is actually an understatement. Its hard to even begin to describe how terrible this movie is. I understand the fact that some movies require you to suspend your belief, but this is just pushing it too far. The story makes absolutely no sense, the plots are too damn confusing and the acting is just horrifying.That said, it can be somewhat entertaining if you don't wear your thinking caps. Paresh Rawal and Johnny Lever do give you some giggles but the rest of them do no justice to their acting talents. Sharmila Tagore and Om Puri are some of the finest actors around in Bollywood and it is sad to see them do roles such as these.The music is crappy, the special effects are crappier and Chunkey Pandey is the crappiest of them all! Avoid watching this movie as it is just not worth it." 
" Timepass but not a complete fool","The movie started off really good with the diamond robbery then the film takes you to a lot of different places like flipping through a comic book which was quite irritating. Paresh Rawal & Johnny Lever were not really that funny as they usually are but Chunkey Pandey was the way he speaks was so funny that I was killing myself with laughter every time he spoke. Arbaaz Khan was the best in the whole film especially in the scene where he was threaten everyone to get the diamond with a crossbow and was wearing sunglasses. Ayesha Takia was looking beautiful & her acting was cute but the rest of the cast were not impressive and Viveik Oberoi is better off in negative roles because his acting in Shootout in Lokhandwala was terrific. The story is similar to Awara Paagal Deewana e.g. comic thriller about everyone after diamond/s. Overall it's OK to be watched once by rent or if it's on TV or something but not the kind of film to be bought on DVD. The only two good songs are Tere Layee & Yeh Dooriyaan." 
" What a crap","Firoz Nadiadwala made his career with HERA PHERI, APD and the recent PHIR HERA PHERI So now he is stuck with the same idea of film-makingSo what this film has?It has a big star cast as usual in such comedy films where they have so many characters and sub plots that you get more confusedSo here we have The once funny now boring Johny Lever and Paresh Rawal(who is loosing his touch now) Shahid Kapur just after VIVAAH perhaps he thought of getting a hit as a comedy as those days before VIVAAH he was going bad in his career Ayesha Takia need i say anything ? Vivek Oberoi- again nothing needs to be said about this crazy people Sunny Deol- phew! Arbaaz, Chunky, Jackie- you find this people in so many such films To sum up this is some stupid comedy based in Dubai(mostly such films r set there) and the most ridiculous situations, boring comedy and stunts and dancesDirection by Ahmed Khan is bad Music is okayAmongst actors Paresh is funny in places but nothing great Johny is monotonous Shahid is okay but he tends to overdo it Ayesha has nothing to do like mostly in her films Sameera too is just added Sunny Deol does his repetitive acting Vivek has a short nonsense role Om Puri and Sharmila are wasted Jackie, Arbaaz, Chunky are crazy as usual Zakir is as usual Suresh Menon is a gap filler" 
" RIP of British Movie SNATCH","Bad rip off of British Movie SNATCH.... if you haven't watched the British version of the movie.. you might enjoy the movie!!! The story is got some good presentation... shown as a bits of comic novel. Vivek Oberio as usual OVER OVER ACTING... SUNNY DOEL - again as usual screaming!!! Jackie - thank god - he doesn't walk like a zombie in this movie... Paresh Rawal and Johny - make u laugh!!! But again, as i told you... its not well in-acted movie..Ayesha Takia - looks totally trash - more like a small kiddo... Somebody needs to tell Shahid Kappor that he is no Superman!!SNATCH is fast paced movie and Brad Pitt is really good in the movie!!!" 
" Probably one of the worst films ever made.",""Fool'N'Final" represents the worst in not only Bollywood film history but the history of cinema itself. There are far too many films like this that are made or rather 'remade' in Bollywood without rhyme or reason. There are no saving graces for the film, unlike other remakes that directly rip off the story and give it an 'Indianize' it as American remakes tend to do, this film doesn't which leaves it as an empty and hollow commercial shell. The problem lies within the fact that this film is nothing more than a 'get rich quick' scheme concocted by it's producers, Base Industries Groups which is owned by the Nadiawala's. The film that they ripped off is Guy Ritchie's 2000 Hit "Snatch". One has to scoff at B.I.G.'s mission statement which can be located on the "Hera Phiri" website where they state that they "believe that the fountainhead of film making lies at the confluence of creativity, talent, technology & technique. In the quest for entertainment that appeals to the heart & mind, the entity considers itself as a medium where the flourish of imagination journeys to the senses of the entertained." (which can be located at this address http://www.phirherapheri.in/base.htm. Obviously just like other film producers, what they say has little to do with what they mean.The film boasts what can be considered a star cast. At the helm is Shahid Kapur and his lady love interest (in a story that is never explored but only hinted at) Ayesha Takia. Their support comes in from Vivek Oberoi, Sunny Deol, Jackie Shroff, Paresh Rawal, Om Puri, Johnny Lever, Gulshan Grover, Arbaaz Khan, Chunky Pandey and Sharmila Tagore. With solid experience like that behind it, you would think that the performances would be at least entertaining, not mind blowing but at least entertaining. But you would be wrong and for this, you can be forgiven. Not one actor manages to entertain. Shahid Kapur is Shahid Kapur which is nothing special because the only reason he is allowed to exist in Bollywood is because millions of teenage girls fawn over him. Ayesha Takia, who managed to spark interest with her role in 'Dor', does nothing with her role leading her to quickly becoming the most un-interesting fairly new talent of the next generation. Oberoi, who at times has almost gleefully recalled his training at NYU continues to spit out roles that incline viewers to believe that he didn't actually learn anything while in training. Deol, Shroff, Puri, Pandy, and Tagore are all wasted in roles that are needed because...well, their roles were in the original and there are character spaces that needed to be filled. However, it is Pandey that gives a stand out performance even though his role is mediocre and pale in comparison to Benicio Del Toro in "Snatch".Though there are snippets of originality that come in the form of the directorial technique, they are pale in comparison to the quick editing techniques and framing that is used by Ritchie in "Snatch". The film is laid out like a comic strip, however, this wanes quickly when there is no need for it when it starts to become over used.The writing is uninspired almost as much as the direction is, this is what causes the overall production to suffer. The actors look uninterested and the viewer quickly realizes that the actors are doing this either because their careers have faded away or because they needed a paycheck to sustain their high flying Bollywood lifestyles (which according to interviews consists of sitting at home and listening to their parents).The soundtrack, which is an integral ingredient in a Bollywood production, is uninspired commercial bird droppings. The picturization of the songs are even worse with actors running around in 'bling' gear pretending to act cool not realizing that a lot of people don't actually by into the 'bling' factor. Oh, and Mike Tyson appears during the end song. Why? Because the producers felt that he could help to sell an appearance that consists of him throwing shadow punches at the camera while inter cutting to the rest of the cast dancing in their 'bling' gear - that and the fact that Tyson needs the money right now.A waste of space and time.1/10." 
" a waste of time","When I heard about the movie Fool 'N' Final, I thought it would be a complete comedy, but it turned out to be the complete opposite.PROBLEMS 1. way too many characters (and it really bothered me the way they put Sameera Reddy in the movie just for eye candy. my mom could have done her role, and she doesn't even speak Hindi) 2. too many plots, and a lot of pointless scenes 3. NOT FUNNY!The cast of this movie, you could say, are all pretty good actors. I really wish they hadn't wasted their time with this movie AND DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME EITHER!" 
" An unfortunate experience for me","I am one of the most unlucky person in the world. I first watch this movie 'fool N final' and the watch the original movie 'Snatch'. That is why I was not able to enjoy the movie Snatch as I was knowing what is going to happen. I must say that 'Fool n Final' is one of the badly failed copy cat movies. Not that all the copy cat movies fails. We have good examples of Aitraaz, Bheja Fry, and not so bad examples of Murder, Kaante. This movie fails in copying the fun of the original plot for Indian audience.If you are reading this to decide whether to watch the movie or not, I will suggest you to watch movie Snatch rather. If you can not get Snatch then may be go on and watch this one. But spend as little money as possible. There are few scenes in the movie which are funny, but they the rest are utter garbage. The changed story line doesn't suit the Indian climate. Music is not so good, acting is not up to mark. I wont say anything much about this.Watch on your risk, or to be safe watch original movie 'Snatch'." 
" What is this thing?","Ahmed Khan is a great choreographer. There were some good dances in Fool and Final. Himmesh Reshammia is a great, though a bit annoying, music director and singer. The songs were good and the music was catchy. But apart from this, there wasn't even a single thing that was good in this s**t of a movie.1) A plethora of disgusting characters including the boy not wanted next door Shahid Kapoor, the horrible, sickly hunk Sunny Deol ( save them, someone!), the bumbling, pathetic Ayesha Takia, who was only good in Dor, the always Punjabi idiot of a father, Om Puri, the wasted Sharmila Tagore, the who-is-she? Sameera Reddy, the no use Sunil Pal, the other wasted Viviek Oberoi ( spelling can be wrong as he keeps changing it all the time for good luck in vain), the same faced, tiring Paresh Rawal, the utterly terrible Cunkey Pandey, the unfunny idiot Johnny Lever and hundreds of other characters.2) No good story. Story stinks. Script was terrible. No good joked in the film. Not at all innovative in thinking.3) Why do they have to call Mike Tyson for the film? The idea stinks like rotten tomatoes.4) Bad starting. Why the emotional twinge in between?In short, I request even completely addled minds not to visit this crap of a film." 
" Weird!!","This is a weird and confusing movie. There is a lot of good comedy be it with Paresh Rawal, Johnny Lever, Sunny Deol, Om Puri, Shahid Kapoor and so on. There are so many different subplots and it becomes real confusing at times. I enjoyed the laughs, but it would be a little easier if there was a sequence. There were some good action scenes, especially the one with Sunny Deol early on top of the truck and the chase was well done. Even the end was alright. I loved that punching scene, where Sunny says his famous dialogue from Damini, but with a new style. Fool N Final is not a bad comedy, just confusing. That is why I give it a 7/10." 
" A film of full entertainment","Best comedy film, very entertaining and good music. But still nobody appraise it. I don't know what happened to Bollywood." 
" This movie is decent","I am so amused by this blockbuster movie it's so hilarious and stylish movie I ever watched and enjoyed this songs are decent direction is fine acting performances are excellent as always good songs and excellent story-line sunny was excellent shah-id was great Vivek did fantastic Jonny is hilarious every time I totally think it's definitely a must watch my rating 9/10" 
" A foolish movie","Well, the title partly indicates what the film is - foolish! It is completely impractical, has some loose comedy, along with some drama and action. They did manage to get lots of notable actors, but still it's just a circus. For eg., how CAN there be criminals like those found in India in UAE also? Like many of Sunny Deol's films, this also portrays him as an invincible superhero.Story revolves around a group of small time thieves in Dubai who get involved with some cheap goons who are behind a very expensive diamond.The only good are FEW comedy scenes, especially on Paresh Rawal's part, and the locations in Dubai. You can gt a good glimpse of the city by watching this film.Everything else is nonsense- the songs, most of the comedy, the drama..It's not worth watching really." 
" confusing yes...but still quite good for a laugh","OK before anyone asks why i gave this film such a rating above average its just that i think this film was actually really good and i'm not saying it's better than K3G or KANK or Don or even tara rumpum because they were all brilliant movies but its just fool n final is OK in some ways n quite good in other ways i mean come on it was so weird i mean there is actually not one god guy in this except sunny deol as they are all thieves and stuff and what was with that name Moscow Chikna?? sounds like a type of dog from Moscow or something. And g-9?? what in the world was that about and i hardly can believe that a paresh rawal and johnny lever could even fit in to their costumes lol" 
" As bad as they come","This is just an awful awful movie. Let's first start with the plot. The writer and directer are trying to shove about 20 different stories into a a 2 hour movie. There are so many subplots and so many stupid scenes which were not necessary. The movie then ended up doing a casting miracle by getting anybody and everybody that people have heard of and that were stupid enough to do the movie. I mean seriously do you need this many actors to make a good movie. The movie has a habit of straying then coming back on the topic on hand and then straying again. Then there is so much confusion throughout the movie. There might one or two parts where the person might let out a laugh but nothing like Hulchul or Hera Pheri or even Chup Chup Ke. Worst movie of the year and worst possibly of the this decade. Plus the whole movie is shot through a comic book which makes it look so stupid and makes Bollywood look like crap. I mean seriously. When we go through stretches were we have Dhoom, Don, Dhoom 2, and Rang De Basanti and then you get this crap. I mean this is just depressing. Now we have to discuss the actors. OK I look at Shahid Kapoor and I see potential. I mean his movies Fida and Shikar were actually good. Then he makes crap like this which just shows that he is going no where. Then we have Ayesha Takia who in my mind is the worst actor in Bollywood. I mean she has no emotions doesn't know how to act, sucks at dancing and not even that good to look at. She annoys me so much. Then we have the great Vivek Oberoi, who had a bright future after the movies company, Saathiya and Dum. I mean i thought he was the next best thing. Then came Kaal followed by Home delivery, Pyare Mohan, and then Naksha. Wow he screwed himself over. Then the He-man himself comes SUNNY DEOL aka seen that done that. I mean does this guy have any range at all. He plays the same guy/character in basically every movie. I mean at first it was cool, then it become OK this is his thing, and now its just wow your still doing that. While his fellow actors Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar and progressed he is still stuck in that some place. It is so depressing to watch him. Then comes Sameera Reddy who probably get lost in Dubai and came onto the set. She was just there, there was no need for her, no lines for her she was just there. Horrible actress although for a second I thought it was Priyanka Chopra only 2 seconds later to have my dreams crushed. OK I'm not gonna go through each actors performance individually so I'm just going to describe the next 7 in 4 words or less. Chunkey Pandey: WTF, Vijay RaaZ: not funny, Johnny lever: annoying, not funny, Paresh Rawal: tries to hard, unfunny, Jackie Shroff: Unnecessay, horrible job. Arbaaz khan: great actor horrible job, Om Puri: WTF!!!. Now who do i have to talk to get 2 hours of my life back?? Is it Ahmed Khan or the writer Neeraj Vora?"
