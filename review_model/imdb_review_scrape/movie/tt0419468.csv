" Classic Bollywood melodrama","A reviewer once said about Bollywood that "if it's a colour, use it" and Baabul is anything if not colourful. There are lots of what could be euphemistically described as vibrant colours on screen at any given time. The plot, such as it is, revolves around love found, love lost and love re-found. All clocking in at little under three hours, with the characters bursting into song at the slightest provocation. Some of the choreography for the song and dance sequences must have taken ages to put together. As usual in Indian films, kissing is taboo and the romantic sequences are remarkably chaste by western standards. All the actors should have life memberships of the academy of over-acting. Emotional nuance is not really the name of the game here. But the actors sure are good looking, even those with grandchildren. They seem to have discovered the fountain of youth. While all of this doesn't sound like a glowing review, points have to be granted for the sheer positive life-force of this film and its life affirming message." 
" Why did they make a movie like that???","Really, if they wanted to show that widows can remarry then they should have made it like this : Even though Sallu dies, Rani gets over him in 5-6 yrs. But throughout the whole ordeal John was with her, helping her through. After some time she starts dating John and falls in love with him and then they get married and then all the drama. I mean, the movie was made in such modern style yet that same old ghissi pitti story ? Why ? I really didn't expect this from a director who made Baghban. Including the fact that it looked like as if Rani didn't even wanted to get married . Why the heck can't they leave a woman single? What's the big deal ? Throw in the bad acting { even from John} , boring songs, and a movie soooo slow that it successfully put me to sleep . {I had to watch it again. No, I'm kidding at this. Dead .Serious. )Jeez! And Rani and Sallu looked bad. Sallu looked as if he had wrinkles.Why can't Rani for once in her life change her style? Hema somehow really irritated me with way she speaks.Gosh !How on earth was a movie like that made? Especially in an year where really good different movies were being made ?Those who are against widows remarrying will continue to do so even after watching this movie. This really didn't get any point across. So what was the point ? This movie is just made to bore us ?and make no sense? and use a solution to a problem used in the '60s and '70s which was totally nonsense?? Please!" 
" A must see film","Well all i can say that I really enjoyed this film it was very unique and different compared to other Indian films that i have watched in the past,i mean most Indian films nowadays have the same sort of storyline, a man meets woman, they fall in love, a sleazy item number to make the movie sell and the happy couple get married, LoL but there was something different about this film that made me go and watch it in the cinema and i am very glad that i did go and see this movie.Basically what the story is about Sallu meets rani's character, fall in love, have a child and get married. Sallu parents are played by Big B who's role in this movie was just fantastic and the beautiful Hema Malini who i have admired and watched her films since i was a child. Om Puri was also very good in this film too. Sallu And Rani get married and have a child and then sadly he dies in a car crash, i mean when i saw the scene i was pretty shocked, it was really well directed. So Rani is alone with the child and she and her in laws find it hard to come to terms with his death.Rani had a best friend whom she has known since she was a child played by John Abraham, he too gave a great preforms in the film and was well suited for his role. Now John has been in love with Rani since he was a child and never told her how he felt, Big B decides that the best thing for everyone is to get Rani and John married, he was the right bloke for her and loved her dearly.Rani does not approve at first and them comes round and the last half and hour of the film would be the best part of the movie in my opinion, all of Big B's family are against the Marrige taken place and they try to stop it, apparently in India women should or are not allowed to get married if there first husband has passed away, i mean why???? and i completely disagree with this , it is totally wrong and immoral, i mean a woman is allowed to live ain't' she? if i was in that situation i would marry again for the sake of my child and my own happiness. So Big B gives this wonderful speech and Om Puri agrees for the couple to be married, so John and Ran do get married in the end and live happily ever after.The songs were mind blowing in the film also, and the Saree's were really lovely too. I really think that you all should go and watch this great family film and take your parents with you too." 
" Quite cliché'ed","¤ Big B:: Starts off as a pampered Papa and later dons the cap of Rajaram Mohan Roy. As an actor he has gone beyond the stage of judgement. The penultimate moments are reserved for the lion to roar.¤ Dream Girl:: Not quite as good as "Baghbaan" in terms of characterisation for the simple fact that this time the Bahu hogs the entire lime-light resulting in animosity in the "Kyonki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi" episode.¤ Rani Mukherjee:: Personally I found the character was presented in OTT. Wonder why the character was presented with a complete "U" turn.¤ Salman/ John:: In their own right, they were just a regular fare.¤ Sarika:: Very short role but it was nice to see her in a Big B movie after Nastik.The usual "Baghbaan" cast Aman Verma, Avtar Gill, Sharat Saxena were adequate.Films from the baton of B R Chopra are noted for the social message that is interlaced in them. It had a fair success riding on their USP. The last outing "Baghbaan" created a milestone in its own right primarily because the social issue it addressed was staring right in the face of "India Shining" and the audience was able to instant connect with "Reverse Mortgage". In the next outing, taking "widow remarriage" as the key-issue with the same ingredients, does it manage to recreate the "Baghbaan" magic? Sadly not because its not quite a burning issue in contemporary times and it comes across as the character (Rani Mukherjee) sans practicality/ common sense to the extent of nearly classified as an emotional fool." 
" Good for home viewing","This film has absolutely nothing new to offer. Not in terms of story or treatment or dialogs...The dialogs are pathetic and the romantic situations juvenile. I felt the actors were all okay except of course John Abraham who is simply terrible. The director, I believe, wanted to cash on the star power of Salman and hence had given him lot of screen time but the script was simply not up to the mark to justify his presence. The film has its moments but these come too abruptly and end too quickly. It is a pity that with reasonably good actors and a genuinely good concept, the director manages to make this mess . You can watch it once in a DVD, perhaps, but spending 10 dollars on this is way too much!" 
" Great movie, fantastic performances by AB and Rani","I just came back from watching 'Baabul' and I really liked it. 'Baabul' deals with a widow's rehabilitation. It begins with Avinash Kapoor's return to India after his studies in the U.S. He has an extraordinary relationship with his parents especially with his father Balraj who is more than a normal father but his best friend. Although they are wealthy and lead a quite modern life on the surface, traditions are given lots of weight by Balraj's brother. Shortly after his return Avinash meets Malvika. She is a painter and quite passionate. They fall in love. Rajat, a singer and Millie's childhood friend, has more than just friend-like feelings for her but he does not express them, especially not after Millie tells him how much she has fallen in love for Avi. Millie and Avi marry and are blessed with a son, Ansh. As it is already written in the plot outline, destiny strikes hard and the wonderful world of the couple, their little son and Avinash's parents collapses when Avi dies in an accident. While Balraj and his wife derive a little bit of comfort from Ansh and his love, Millie falls in a state of depression. Now, Balraj decides to give her life a new meaning especially because he does not regard her as a daughter-in-law but more as his own daughter. He does not want her to live her whole life in solitude and despair - what the society claims her to do - but bring colours back into it. He is even ready to defy traditions and old values just to see Millie find her smile again. But on his way to do so he has to cope with his elder brother and even his wife. The first half of the movie is filled with a lot of 'masti' and light entertainment in form of song and dance sequences and Millie and Avis' love. In the second half a lot of tissues must be used. The dialogs throughout the movie are really great and well-written, so is the climax. As for the main characters Balraj and Millie, both, Rani and Amitabh do a fantastic job and play their roles with persuasion. Amitabh is in his best form and Rani adds another outstanding performance to her already impressive list of excellent-played characters. Although the movie has its flaws and won't be appreciated by everyone - just like any other movie -, who cares as long as it is entertaining. 'Baabul' has it all: Fun, love, dance, happy and sad moments as well as very good performances from the whole cast but fantastic ones from Amitabh and Rani. A piece of great entertainment for families. Go and watch it!" 
" Filled with many of the usual cliches...but still marvelous and much deeper than some might think.",""Baabul" is an interesting movie...much like two entirely separate movies stuck together. The first portion is a very traditional Indian romance...with all the usual cliches, such as the singing montages, the normal meet cute and that she disliked him when they first met. While this was good...it was also incredibly familiar. However, the second portion, in its way, is anything but traditional...heck, it deliberately seeks to subvert traditions....and this is why I grew to eventually love this movie.In the romantic portion, Avi (Salman Khan) is the beloved son of a rich man, Balraj (Amitabh Bachchan). Avi meets Mili (Rani Mukerji) and instantly is smitten with her. Not surprisingly, they eventually marry. During all this portion, there are hints to what is coming next (such as the aunt who is essentially kept a prisoner following her husband's death). Yes, Avi is killed in an accident and Mili is inconsolable. While she has a son to raise, she is barely functional. And, throughout this, Balraj's heart breaks. This is because although she is technically his daughter-in-law, he sees her like a daughter and would do anything to take away her pain. So, he formulates a plan...to find Rajat (John Abraham) and bring him back to court Mili and, hopefully, marry her and give her a reason to live.While all this seems pretty reasonable for a non-Indian, there are Indian traditions that many follow that simply could not allow for Mili to remarry. For many, a widow is always a widow.....and her happiness should come from being a widow and staying at home and...well...existing. So how will Balraj deal with his family? His wife doesn't want Mili to marry, as she'll likely leave them...and take the grandchild with her. And, what about Balraj's older brother? He's extremely traditional and will not flex in the least. So what's next?The final portion of the film deserves an 11 out of 10...it is that good. The giant climactic scene where Balraj is confronted by his family (when they object to Mili's remarriage) is simply brilliant and Bachchan is given a marvelous monolog...one that grips you by the heart and won't let go. Overall, a marvelous film...one you should see with a box of Kleenex nearby!" 
" Outdated social problem ?","Here we have a quite modern family, son staying in U.S.for 7 years and all that, with the most modern cars, a big luxury house with sprawling lawns, domestic help at the finger tips, and the father and son duo calling each other buddy ! Even the lady of the house can shake the leg or two , to add to the fun ! However, it's the other brother, played by Om Puri, in his typical style, quite convincingly, that plays the part of a square peg in an other wise round hole ! the movie starts off breezily, with lighter moments, romance, and some fun ! however, Salman khan with eye bags, and Rani looking washed out this time, it's a little hard to digest, that they are so new to the game of love ! the age shows ! In fact, Hema Malini looks much more prettier than Rani, even at this age ! the age old formula of the hero hiding his true connections, is once again repeated here ! Over to the birth of a baby, growing up, and all that ! then the sudden accidental death of Salman, and now it's the second chapter, in specially, Rani's life !aware of her earlier friendship with Rajat, played reasonably well, but some how giving an impression of miscasting against Rani, and in this particular role, some questions arise, like why did he not try to find out, how Rani is, when he loved her so deeply ? Then there are all those tension mounting in the family situation, when Amitabh decides to bring Rani and Abraham together, but every body is against ! And then while the other widow in the family, that is Pushpa, enacted by Sarika, speaks out for the first time, about her woes, but briefly, does the old fashioned other brother realizes, that the social customs are not greater than the human beings, traditions could be questioned, if needed ! Happy ending, after much tear jerking ! But the point is, this problem of widow remarriage, is getting absolutely out-dated, specially in the affluent society's ! Premrog, another movie, handling this problem, was much more touching, because it was a period film, and dealt with the traditional household of Lanlords ! Here, in Babul, we have the convenient back drop of a most modern household, with narrow mindsets, only for fueling the crisis, which is more or less artificial, to that extent, and context ! Wouldn't it have been proper for the father-in-law, to take every body in confidence, including his mature wife, rather than flashing an expensive wedding card in her face, or going ahead with the ceremony, with such pomp and show ? but after all, what else can you expect in an Indian cinema, with it's one eye on the box ? the songs are good for the score, but not for the lyrics, especially, the one when Rajat performs live ! they are too prosaic, and lack the flow of a poetic content one expects ! the voices of the play back singers do not match, and therefore, seem odd ! and that Qawali type of Urdu style number, when every body dances Mujara type, is absolutely out of place , for a Hindu family !How can the viewer relate to a problem, which does not touch the cord of probability ? the current situations, and the social scenario, have different problems, as a lot of water has flown under the bridge since then ! Good performances, and a lot of extravaganza simply wasted over an outdated issue ! Tut, Tut, wish the story writer could have at least consulted a sociologist, before coming out with this brilliant idea ! And some tips to Rani ! better stick to your earlier dress designer, and health consultant, otherwise , the end of your career is near ! Stick to your Paheli, and kabhi Alvida.. Chalte Chalte looks, and please eat well ! All which suits Zinta, is not meant for you, Rani, we like you as you are ! And God ! why did they have to pick up the muscle man Salman ? Congratulations Amitabh ! one can watch this movie, at least for your sake, if nothing else !" 
" Not all that.","General Comment: It wasn't terrific because the storyline was average,the acting was not brilliant except for Amitabh Bhachan who was superb,the songs were crap. Storyline: Balraj Kapoor (Amitabh Bhachan) is looking for happiness for his daughter in law Millie (Rani Mukherjee) after his son,Avinash (Salman Khan) who is madly in love with his wife Millie. What Millie does not know is that her best friend Rajat (John Abraham) is in love with her but he wants Rani Mukherjee to be happy so he does not say anything to her when she is getting married to Avinash. But when Avinash dies Amitabh Bhachan tries to get Millie married to Rajat. But as you know in the Indian religion a widow is not allowed to get married after her husbands death so Balrajs older brother (Balwant) does not want Millie to get married again but later he realises what Millie must be going through so lets her get married to Rajat." 
" Long on content, Short on Time & Expression...","It's clear here that Ravi Chopra has tried to capitalize on success of Baghbaan. He has tried to collect a similar cast & similar slot but not the plot. The story is too long expressed in too short of a time. Movie has an OK storyline & good concept of Vidhwa Vivah (not sure how much it holds true in 21st century though, its far more different now) but the execution does not give enough time to emotions. The movie moves so fast that its difficult to enjoy the happiness & feel the pain of characters.In first half of the movie it's like a budding love story (Chalte-Chalte), an existing love triangle (KKHH), father-son relationship (Viruddh/Waqt), a happy family story and lots of stuff. And suddenly in second part it becomes a sad story of reincarnation of love (Hum-Tum), re-marriage, traditions & what not. Movie has so much to express but the screenplay does not allow it to be shown efficiently on screen. Movie does has a few gud moments but hardly any time to really enjoy or feel them.Amitabh & Rani have been gr8 as always Amitabh-Hema still look stunning. Even Salmaan & John have given nice performances. Not sure what Parmeet & Aman were doing in the movie though, they have got better work on small screen I guess. Overall performances are fine & movie looks okay too (cinematography). Songs & Music also seems fare.In all the movie is fine & okay for one time watch. However with such a great cast & return of team Baghbaan (even the concept is nice), everyone expected a lot better. That's right..." 
" Carry an asprin for your own sake!","I would love to believe that either Ravi chopra directed this film in his sleep, or that he had some inspiration from Ekta Kapoor because i REFUSE to believe that he would actually make a 3hr film for justifying a 3 minute monologue!Coming from a banner of BR films' repute (that too celebrating it's 50th year) this film disappoints (on so many levels), to say the least, as it is everything that BR Chopra would not make.Perhaps the idea was to make a film that would remind us of the era that was 50 years ago. I say this because the dialogs are so cliché, it's disturbing. the characters are so one-dimensional its appalling. and the story is so predictable, I wonder if a toddler wrote it.... the dramatic payoffs are simply comical and the audience was left laughing at a scene where sympathy was expected....salman tries to bring comic relief to the first half, but due to bad direction and worse dialog, one can't help but feel exasperated. the second half is so slow that "i wanted to rip my arm off, just so i could have something to throw(at the screen)" (yes, it's joey's line)I was surprised to find that Mr. Bacchan, and Hema Malini could actually act so badly (hema-ji, has little or no role anyways) .... and Rani Mukherji and AB Sr. have none of the magic one has come to expect after "Black." the less said about john Abraham, the better. (Two words: Acting School!) in the second half the cast and crew tried it's best to put the audience to sleep, (and a few did in fact doze off) but i kept up with caffeine and bore the film (as it bored me) so i could warn others about this heinous crime against film making!)let's now come to talk about the branding... OMG!!! Eros jewelry, Brooke bond, nerolac, kotak... please stop!!! i'm here to watch a film, not an advertising campaign!!!OVERALL: The Good: The kid, Rani Mukherji's bathroom-mirror scene, Amithabh Bachchan's 3 minute monologue at the endThe Bad: Everything else you have to endure to GET to the end!!The Ugly: the dialogs, the dialogs, the dialogs, the direction, the costumes and jewelry!Final word of caution, watch at your own peril!" 
" A cliché-filled Cliché with a cliché coating","If the title of this summary weren't self-explanatory, then let me begin my ranting about how clichéd this movie actually was. If one were to write a documentary about clichés, they could use this movie to supplement any single example of cliché that one could possibly think of.Lets begin by talking about the story line. The first-half, which dealt with a love story and father-son relations as dry as could be. While the father son relation between Amitabh and Salman was passable, there seemed to be absolutely no chemistry between Salman/Rani. First of all, they seemed to just rush the love story, deciding that it wasn't really all that important, as Salman wouldn't even be in the second half of the movie.The comedy in the first half wasn't great either. Parts were OK, but the writers obviously thought they did a better job than they actually did.The second half of the movie proved to be one of the most predictable and boring scripts ever. Its as if the producer deciding to bring in script writers from TV soaps and wrap up the script. Furthermore, the theme was unbelievably outdated.Question>What do you get when you mix a bad storyline, with a bad director, bad writers, a horrible theme, and an extremely outdated moral message? Answer:Baabul" 
" Outrageous message in the 21st century - a woman's happiness=husband","Being out of the loop I did not know about this movie until now. I do not know what the general reaction to this movie was, can only hope it was a super flop. The point of the movie seems to be that widow remarriage is a good thing. Agreed. But this movement had started more than a century ago and I don't think exists in the upper classes in urban Mumbai (which is where the movie is based). So, the movie should have been set where this is still an issue (like the movie WATER). OK now let's allow the movie some artistic license. So, what is it that we learn from this movie? We learn that women have the right to a happy and fulfilling life even if their husbands are dead. And how are they to have this life - by getting themselves another HUSBAND!!! And that too she should not fight for her rights and demand such a thing but hope that her patriarchal father-in-law has the goodness of heart to ALLOW her to remarry. Really, is the concept of women's rights, women's own identity so alien to Bollywood? AAKHIR KYON. This was a commercial movie made in Bollywood more than 30 YEARS ago and even that talked about the importance and necessity of a woman having her own identity. Seriously, does Bollywood suffer from Collective Amnesia? I can only end with AAKHIR KYON?" 
" A movie confronting widow marriage.","This movie has a lack of excitement and energy and brings us to the brink of boredom during the first 1 hour 45 minutes, after this initial part the rest of the movie is very well composed and the actors have done well to lift up the movie in this period. Initial part of the movie shows the inexperience of the director to keep audience interested. If the movie be edited so that the initial 1 hour 45 minutes be compressed to 30 to 40 minutes the movie would be a treat to see.Anyway the movie is all about widow marriage. Where Balraj Kapoor (Amitabh Bachchan) tries to get happiness into his daughter-in-law Malvika Talwar's(Rani Mukherjee) life who is sad and depressed due the dead of her husband and Balraj Kapoor's son Avinash Kapoor(Salman Khan) by getting her to marry Rajat(John Abraham). This is objected by Balraj's wife and brother played by Hema Malini and Om puri." 
" What Baabul? Call me Buddy","I can't believe this movie wasn't titled 'Buddy' - that's how father-and-son Amitabh Bachchan and Salman Khan keep referring to each other throughout this predictable film with a widow-remarriage theme. Ravi Chopra suffers from a Baghban hangover and tries to replicate its success here. And fails.The first half is the syrupy-sweet half of a Karan Johar flick - with its loving family and designer parties and you keep wondering why you weren't born into a family like that.America-returned Salman (he returns after 7 years, a possible take on the saat janam ka saath theme) woos golf-enthusiast Rani. A few cups of tea and golf lessons later, the couple receive the blessings of Bachchan and Hema Malini and settle down to a lifetime of family life.Almost.Salman gets run down by a car while coming back to his young son's birthday party (apparently he was never taught in school to look left-right-left while crossing roads).Enter Rani weeping. She's been doing that for ages now (Black, KANK) and we're tired of those tears streaming down her eyes. The widowed daughter-in-law bothers Big B and he strives for ways to make the roses in her garden bloom again. He turns to John Abraham, Rani's childhood friend who still cherishes a secret love for her.From then on, the film trudges on towards its destined end. Throw in a few villains (Read extended family of tauji Om Puri, Aman Varma and Parmeet Sethi) to preach about how bringing widows to a wedding and getting them married brings bad luck. Sarika frowns and weeps in her guest appearance as Bachchan's long-widowed sis-in-law. She's not alone - Hema weeps, Rani weeps, John weeps, Big B weeps and in the end even Om Puri (when he suddenly decides he has sinned by berating widows) can't help shedding a few tears.On second thoughts, this film is still worth a watch despite its storyline. Music by Aadesh Shrivastav is surprisingly of the non-grating variety. Big B turns playback singer with his sterling rendition of Kehta hai Baabul. Salman is his usual effervescent self, Hema Malini is as regal as ever, even John impresses in downcast-lover mode.On the flipside, we have some shoddy costume designing. Rani looks like a parrot in some scenes while the very sight of John in white trousers and white shoes would send shivers down Jeetendra's spine. Thank God Ravi Chopra is now directing a comedy - I am just about sick of didactic movies trying to change society.As for audience reactions, the usual suspects - middle-aged aunties - waxed eloquent about the movie while a couple of youngsters left midway. Take your pick." 
" Wonderful Emotional Film","Avi (Salman Khan) falls instantly in love with Millie (Rani Mukerji), and after much wooing and a little trouble, wins her. She is welcomed by his parents, Balraj (Amitabh Bachchan) and Shobhna (Hema Malini) as if she were their natural daughter. She and Avi experience years of happiness, and then a life-changing tragedy occurs. Balraj shows his great love for Millie as he defies traditions to make her happy again.The first half of this is a delightful romance following the happy life of Avi and Millie. Mukerji and Khan have good chemistry and played lovers well. After the tragedy, the film looses it's light- heartedness. Mukerji and Bachchan both gave excellent emotional performances. The supporting cast were quite good. There was some lovely music, and nice choreography as well. The plot was strong, well written, and well-executed. This is a wonderful film overall."
