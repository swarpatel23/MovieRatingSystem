" Predictable Conclusion, Effervescent Journey","2 States had me in two states of mind. While it's mostly simple and light hearted first half made me look forward to the rest of the movie, the darker and grittier, though somewhat predictable 2nd half made me sit up and take notice of the proceedings.This tale is essentially that of two much in love IIM Graduates from two corners of India wishing to have their culturally clashing and hard to woo families completely accept their alluring alliance. Based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Chetan Bhagat, the film for me gets full marks in the screenplay adaptation department. Alas, sometimes the editing, tying up of lose ends from a storytelling perspective (what happens to the psychiatry sessions? When does it end), and staple Bollywood melodrama (or the lack thereof in the tame ending) makes for wishful film viewing.What worked for me was the terrific chemistry and naturally effortless performances of the lead actors. Alia gets full marks for her terrific portrayal of Tamilian Ananya (despite her being a thorough North Indian girl - this being her third film, this is one girl to watch out for over and over again). Arjun inches close for his gritty and multi layered portrayal of Krish (I wish there was a bit more body language/voice modulation/effort to portray the 7 years younger character, or the slightly older father of two kids).The supporting cast is tremendous too! Be it Ronit Roy in the stupendous special appearance as the father fighting his inner demons, or Amrita Singh with her loud mouthed yet large hearted portrayal of Krish's mother. Revathi and Shivkumar as Ananya's parents are subtle and nuanced and add the required pathos to the story at just the right time. I especially loved Revathi's rendition of 'Kaho Na Pyaar Hai' and Shiv's almost childlike reactions to the same. The direction is naturally delightful (a great debut by Abhishek Varman), the screenplay superb, the music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy hummable (especially the excellently filmed 'Locha E Ulfat'), and the cinematography by Binod Pradhan just right, making this perfect as far as the technical requirements are concerned. Some loose ends could have been tied better, had the editor - Namrata Rao been allowed some more screen time (was it the over expectations from her post Kahaani?). But this is a glitch that can be safely ignored in an otherwise effective film.Though some scenes of intimacy could have been done without, this is indeed a great family watch that strangely will teach you a thing or two about why, how, and when family matters. Watch it for a fluffy slice of life. Don't expect the stars, and you might just moon over this not so typical Bollywood Romance. Go for it!" 
" Entertainer - Beautifully done.","Yet another movie which surpasses the mother book in terms of quality. The direction of the movie is mind blowing and Chetan Bhagat is once again blessed with a movie which can thunder the Box Office. You will wonder at one stage if the story of the movie you watch is the same of the book you read few years ago- the book is very entertaining of course. Alia Bhatt and Arjun Kapoor have done exceptionally well in the screen. I never knew Alia was this beautiful. Arjun Kapoor has done the role of a lethargic Punjabi perfectly. The movie, from the start, gives the spectator good entertainment and a smiling face. The Script is very gentle. In the final parts of the movie, at variance with the feelings that the book creates for a reader, a spectator gets very much emotional. The emotions, portrayed in the movie, between the hero and his dad, have been so picturesquely put into screen that it can wet your eyes. Ronit Roy who plays the role of the hero's father has contributed a major share by giving a new aura to the movie's story-line. His outstanding acting and attitude would be the main things that you will be talking about after getting out of the theater. The cast for the movie is very beautifully selected. It need not be mentioned here about the class of acting that Revathi and Amritha Singh can deliver. They are all always at their best; be it for any role. As we all know from the book itself, the story line isn't that classy or touching. Maybe none of the jokes or scenes will linger in your heart after you get out of the theater; only the entertainment and happiness that the movie provided will be thought about. And by prudence, the director has omitted certain parts of the book from the movie; only a few scenes, such as the scene where 'Ananya' screws the 'Duke' are a bit boring and unoriginal. Apart from that, there is nothing to be seriously criticized in the movie, or to exclaim and shout, 'Highly impossible things'. Words by the hero, that he wishes to write normal and simple stories which have the ability to become the 'HERO' in people's heart will ring in your mind like a chant, and will give hope to all the authors who are striving hard to come up; for we all know how successful Chetan Bhagat is. He is the man who made India read. I will say that it's a good movie to watch and I can assure that none will be disappointed. The spectators would very surely be coming out of the theater with happy and smiling faces." 
" A great movie with a great story","This movie was surprise for me I assure you it is in positive way. I am very much fond of books but don't know why I never liked Chetan Bhagat. But this story was superb and I know books are much well narrated than movie. so I will read another books of the writer.Alia Bhatt looked beautiful. in Student of the year she was like loaded with cosmetic and over shown with fancy cloths. But in this movie her role is superb in normal cloths and in the role of a normal girl, she proved that she is going to be a challenge for all actress.in all previous movies, Arjun Kapoor was doing Gunda type roles. but in this movie he looked cute. I knew the story and before going to movie I was thinking that he will be a mistake for this role. But he was surprisingly cute in this role.Abhishek Verman did a great job. full movie is in continuous process. you can't be bored in a single scene. hats off for the direction.Ronit Roy got a small role in this movie but he did full work with that. his small role was fully noticed and it is like he is in every scene in the movie.Songs are also in hit list of bollywood. really listen-able and every mood songs are life of this movie. if you take my advice, you must listen the songs you will be more than happy.only one thing which I want to add some kisses were unnecessary. with family you can feel some odd. but they were quite simple so you can't cut many points for that.I give 9 out of 10. you must watch this movie.www.caprashant.wordpress.com" 
" The Politics & Apolitics Of Marriage. ♦ 88%","The book was splendid. I didn't have much expectations for none of the cast is in my favorites list. However, 20 minutes into the non-linear screenplay, I was dumbstruck at the very charming adaptation.Starting with a tuneful version of Georges Bizet's wildly famous Carmen Habañera Suite, the titles start with Krish, played perfectly by Arjun Kapoor, speaking to a therapist. The story is told from his point of view till the end. The college life romance is amazingly captured with magnificent photography. Alia Bhatt's Ananya character is perhaps the most important in her career; she's all glimmering throughout. She is hot, lovely & faultless. Only the direction by Abhishek Varman seemed a tad amateurish.All love happens in the first half and before the climax, you are treated with Chennai's atmosphere. Coupled with mild humor and humongous romance, it is a sure treat for hungry eyes; it has a lesson or two in courtship. Then, the second half highlights the period after love: how the families have to like each other and how the lovebirds cajole them with undivided attention. Now this phase is heavily melodramatic but you won't feel bored because Amrita Singh, Shiv Kumar Subramaniam, Revathi & Ronit Roy are so imbibed with their portrayals, you will definitely fall in love with them. The latter two just up the ante that the film just moves 2-3 notches higher.Whoever did the costume work deserves long rounds of applause for that is the factor that pushes the wagon to the star. Art department is equally fantastic, mostly the sequences towards the climax and that of weddings/parties/festivals. Good dialogs & brilliant music & score intensifies the experience.Although, the reality quotient drops 2-3 notches down as the characters only seem to do what would advance the movie. No references are made of their work, let only anyone's work or life other than the specific point it is trying to make. Maybe the writers failed to gather the characters together with their nuances with respect to how they are in real life. But that is not a concern here.Running for about 150 minutes, it speaks about romance, marriage - its politics & apolitical elements, relationships & the stereotypes of inter- regional marriage. It was a pleasant experience.BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a universal melodrama, coupled with mild humor & romance, 2 States is the staple movie to go for this weekend. 9/10.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? Not really, but you can give it a try. See the irony?" 
" MY REVIEW: Worth Watching Once!!","2 States. Based on the book of Chetan Bhagat where he touches the details of cross cultural marriage in a humorous way, 2 States remains faithful to the idea and as a movie experience also it does not disappoint. Arjun and Alia showcase easy chemistry. Alia looks charming and does better than Arjun in emotional scenes. As their parents, Amrita Singh, Ronit Roy, Revathy and Shivkumar do quite well. I felt southern India flavor of movie was captured more effectively than northern flavor. The rough father-son relationship between Arjun and Ronit is done upright. First half breezes through while second half drags a bit although nice music and quirky dialogues helps you keep going through melodramatic scenes. Abhishek Varman as writer of adapted screenplay and director impresses in his first outing. Movie does not quite dazzle you but makes your two and half hours worth spending in the theater. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for 2 States. Last year it was Kai Po Che, this year it is 2 States, Chetan Bhagat is having quite a good time at celluloid along with books." 
" Exaggerated stereotypes of culture differences","As a person brought up in a family with 2 states culture IRL this is just a cheap mockery of exaggerated stereotypes in a loud nonsensical lengthy Bollywood movie. Could not even get through the book but was hopeful at least the movie would do justice to the best kind of love stories in India. The real life issues of reactions of different family members, difference in opinions, some compromises in traditional value, concerns of extended family and how they come about to achieve a middle ground none of which was depicted in a proper way. It was borderline racist sometimes without being apologetic even when there was absolutely no requirement for scenes like that. And no, that never increased the humor quotient of the movie which was already as low as their standards. To summarize, it was as if a Hollywood romcom was made about interracial marriages where the family of the whites gifts fired chicken to the blacks and the blacks would get them all some guns as gifts because they are from Texas." 
" Sweet and cute love story","Director Mr. Abhishek Varman has done apt work. He has completely justified the one of my favorite book ,2 STATES in its cinematic adaption. There are very few shots of fix block. Otherwise most of the scenes are captured with perfect movement. It gives nice feeling while watching. Director of photography Mr. Vinod Pradhan work is impressive. Complete film carries a vibrant look. Dialogues by Hussain Dalal gel completely with the character and at places tickle the funny bones in smart way. Movie is nice but due to based on the famous book, sometimes it slows down, because they had to justify the book also. I wish length of movie should have been little less. Performance wise Arjun Kapoor is very good. Alia Bhatt looks pretty and performed very well. Amrita Singh, Ronit Roy, Revathy, Shivkumar Subramaniam as Ananya's father has performed very nicely. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is OK." 
" A true adaptation to the novel and a brilliant edition in today's mainstream cinema!","We all are quite familiar with movies which are based on novels, real- life stories, autobiographies etc. but few films exist which strikes the right chord! Many movies (in Bollywood) like 3 Idiots (2009), Kai Po Che (2013) have been adapted from novels of one masterpiece: Chetan Bhagat! He is the main reason behind the success of these movies and many others and again for the latest release of his novel "2 States" adaptation in Bollywood!! This movie is so wonderful and doesn't require any action scenes, over-the-top dialogues, old-typical themes etc. but the makers have given a remarkable effort with some minor changes as compared to the book!! So here we go:Story: The story is beautifully crafted!! 2 people of different culture, different states fall in love with each other. But whether they know the consequences they would face when they would face the discomfort and the pressures when people talk of inter-caste liaison, the unyielding love and the resolve to win the parents' trust, each and every aspect with the emotions included! Will they succeed in convincing their parents to get married or will their relationship would get over is the main plot of this film.Cast: Arjun Kapoor as Krish Malhotra is delightful!! After films like Ishaqzaade (2012) and Gunday (2014) where he has a goofy character, he truly succeeds in playing a sweet, simple kind of a guy who gives importance to his relationships! He charms and gives a meticulous performance! One of his finest performance till date!Alia Bhatt as Ananya Subramanium is first-rate!! She is beautiful yet witty and gives a delightful performance as a Tamil-Brahmin girl!! Her chemistry with Arjun is electrifying! We can say that Alia has now became an evolved actress and she knows when to capture emotions at the right time!!Amrita Singh as Krish's Mother is a revelation! She truly is fantastic as the typical Punjabi mother-in-law who justifies her role!! She steals the show in most of the scenes!!Ronit Roy as Krish's Father is extraordinary!! He develops an antagonistic relationship with his son but he is remarkable!! Watch out for the twist that he would get in the 2nd half!Shiv Subramanium and Revathy as Ananya's Father and Mother gives decent performances!! They are quite efficient!!Direction: Director Abhishek Varman should deserve the Best Debut Director in next year's film awards! He truly strikes the right chord!! He gives an remarkable effort but capturing sweet melodramatic scenes and wonderful emotions which come during the course of the film!! Both he and Karan Johar (Producer) have wonderfully executed a delightful film!!Music: The music of the film is exceedingly well!! The songs truly move you and will put a smile in your face!! Songs like "Locha-e-Ulfat" and "Offo" are best numbers which will make you groove along with it! "Mann Mast Magan" is a wonderful and top-notch song that steals your heart!!On the whole, 2 States is one of those rare Hindi films which have came in a long time and had explored us the diverse cultures, melodramatic scenes, problems of inter-caste marriages but one thing knocks all of it: "Love"! It really empowers on all of the dizzy situations!! Strongly recommended to people of all age-groups and also to those who fantasize about diverse people!!" 
" STEREOTYPE all the way through!!","how on earth is this rated above 7 it is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen come on your son is marrying a girl and you insult her parents and indulge in racism? Please show me one place where that happens The actors are so bad . Its time start child like Alia Bhat stop getting fame. this movie has no story whatsoever. and on top of that it this movie also encourages misbehaviour towards your own parents. if someone in your family is expelled from his job you taunt him or you support him. Worst movie ever . totally illogical and stupid. please avoid watching this at all costs. it is not even funny which I thought would be." 
" A Winner!","Based on the 2009 novel of the same name written by Chetan Bhagat, '2 States' is an entertaining, engaging & cute film, that doesn't' fail to deliver. Its A Winner!'2 States' Synopsis: A young couple's plan to get hitched, gets crushed when their racial parents disapprove of their marriage. '2 States' has an amazing first-hour & the lead-stars, Arjun & Alia, share an infectious chemistry on-screen. The Tamil-Punjabi conflict does get a bit boring, especially in the middle of the second-hour, but a heart-warming culmination, does the trick. Its not a perfect film, but its most certainly, enjoyable! The Screenplay hits the right notes, at most parts. Barring a few dull sequences post-interval, the film is consistently engaging & smooth. Abhishek Varman makes a terrific debut as a Director. He has handled the entire film, remarkably. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is well-done. Art & Costume Design, are fair. Music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is fantastic. Performance-Wise: Arjun & Alia are the life of the show. They enact the love-struck protagonists with pure charm. Their on-screen chemistry, as mentioned before, is infectious. Amrita Singh is delightfully rude, while Shiv Kumar Subramaniam & Revathy are wonderfully restrained. Ronit Roy stands out. He's excellent, yet again! Achint Kaur is lovely in a brief role.On the whole, '2 States' clicks big time. Strongly Reccomeded!" 
" The movie is a full time waste!!!!","Firstly the basic thing to mention is that please tell Alia Bhatt that she can not act and she can never act. According to me the movie was a total time waste, guys they actually copied the dialog from the movie. Well they should learn something from the makers of Kai PO Che, they also made the movie on a book but at least they had their own dialogs The music of the movie was good as compared to the cast, i would rather say that the movie could have been better if they have concentrated on the screenplay of the movie rather on the promotions of the movie and wasting money on making the poster. I would say that the poster of the movie was eye catching but the cast and screenplay made the movie not than a time pass, well i would rather say it is not even a time pass especially for those who have read the novel, the novel is a masterpiece but the movie is a piece of S***. So guys who have not seen it, i would rather say to download it and watch it rather than going and wasting money in the multiplexes." 
" College Life-Funny-Emotional Fully dedicated","2 States as of till now we have only heard in Novels but this time its on screen by Abhishek Varman. A complete dose of Love Story and Entertainer Package. As The Novel '2 States' is all about the true life of the great writer Chetan Bhagat, The whole story in the novel is cast to a fantastic movie which gives a complete package to the viewers, and again this movie never let me bore or sit idol of minute each scene and dialog is perfectly matched with the situation, It has a starting with college life than comedy after that Romance than Problems with little Turns and Little Emotional with a Happy Ending which is completely family entertainment package and also a Reality. So go out watch 2 States and explore yourself." 
" Stereotypes, Pro-South India","The movie closely follows the book. But is not really as entertaining I guess, because it lacks the humour quotient present in the book.Also, it gets pretty boring by the end and too exhausting. But the weirdest parts of the movies are where Ronit Roy is slapped by his son, Ananya's interaction with Krish's family and the ending. First of all, that slapping bit was a bit overdone I think since other than one time his father didn't really do much to deserve it. And later there is not guilt from Krish and in fact it is again Ronit Kapoor who is trying to make amends. I distinctly remember thinking while reading the book that the father was right in flying down south and arranging the marriage, but here it seemed unjust. Krish makes a lot of effort in trying to please his in-laws and Ananya makes zero. I think this is a part I didn't really like about the book and I wish the movie was more sensible. Why anybody would want to marry a girl who is so non-adjusting is beyond me. The ending is all about the Punjabis making compromises and the South Indians having their way. While in the book, this was funny and not in the least offensive, here it was actually disturbing. They should've reached a middle ground and not do everything the Southern way, it just sends a bad message about intercaste marriages. It seemed more like a pro-South and anti-North movie while there should have been almost equal respect for both cultures.Acting wise everybody was okay and Alia is looking very pretty." 
" Get in for some cross cultural jokes and fun.. once watch entertainer","2 States (2014) Review: A cross cultural rom-com which portrays the love to marriage journey of Krish a Punjabi boy and Ananya a Tamilian girl. The prime focus is on the acceptance of cross cultural marriage. The movie is a picturesque of the semi autobiographical novel by Chetan Bhagat. So we all know the plot well before watching the film so don't expect any major twists and turns. It was simple but slow moving because of the pace and long conversations. Arjun Kapoor as Krish has justified his role but it was boring to look at him with his sleep walking style of presence from the start till the end. Alia Bhatt had struggled to fit in the shoes of her role for me as a Tamilian she was not apt for a Tamil girl. I accept she is cute and beautiful but that doesn't help this character. She was good in the last movie Highway and seemed more justifying. She seemed to be pushed into the role and her face, body and expressions where too immature for the role. The cultural dressing she wore in certain scenes where too colourful and artificial. Being a Tamil girl she hardly spoke Tamil in the movie. Interesting sections where the bumping scenes of their parents. Particularly Amrita and Revathi justified their roles and lived up to their culture. Both father roles where over shadowed. The novel was itself little anti Tamil and the movie seemed to zoom up the same anti Tamil factor more. Get in for some cross cultural jokes. This is indeed a happy inter caste or to be right interstate love movie. If you liked reading the novel and wanted to get a better feel of it definitely this movie is less satisfying. Instead you can go and read it once again. But not sure this film might be a blockbuster taking into account that in recent times cross culture movies (Chennai Express) are becoming major hit. Over all 2.25/5.-Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran" 
" Maddeningly inconsistent, but not too bad","I have not read the book this is adapted from. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying this one, and this adaptation was much better than the (brickbats out) adaptation of 'Five-point-someone', in spite of the fact that this plot's all beenthere- donethat from the perspective of a typical willthey-won'tthey Shaadi movie.Having said that, the plot does ensure that the focus is maintained throughout on the mission undertaken by both protagonists, though it narrated totally from the male perspective, and also seems biased thus.People are calling it regressive, but IMO, they're the ones viewing their world with an idealistic lens, OR the ones who wield the censor scissors. The racist comments depicted in the movie are nothing compared to the ones bandied about in the real world, or by nasty satirists, a la 'Family guy' or 'Simpsons'. Thankfully, I had my expectations synchronized with Bollywood reality, and thus was not disappointed much.The technical aspects are all slick, and follow today's trend on having just-about perfect frames. The score is effective and doesn't call attention to itself, with the first track standing out, and the other ones going the instantly-forgotten route - some of them do slow the overall pacing though.Performance-wise, Alia Bhatt has to be the most natural actress working today (I really dug her performance in 'Highway'). Arjon Kapoor redeems himself after the travesty that was 'Gunday'. From among the supporting cast, Ronit Roy stands out. I thought he was being typecast, but he does troubled so well, that one doesn't mind that he re-does what he did in 'Udaan' in a different milieu. Amrita Singh does well too, and Revathy and Shiv Subramaniam are wasted, but are good.If you are a detail-oriented person and want Bollywood to improve in terms of dotting the t and crossing the i (gei ii?), then this one's not (much) for you. However, if (like me) you can forgive the odd transgression and enjoy the overall ride, remembering the good parts and the effort, then be prepped to have a nice time at the cinema watching this one." 
" Lost Opportunity-Shows weak characters","Two States- The problem in the movie was not people from two states falling in love and trying to get married but in fact was alcoholism, domestic violence, and dowry. The movie made no attempt to educate the general masses about these social issues rampant in the society instead everyone acts as though they are part of a certain culture and acceptable norms in certain cultures.(especially north) Instead of reporting the dowry case to the police the heroine just negotiates with the bridegroom to accept what he is given. BS! Lost opportunity to show how an educated girl can be assertive and take action. No attempt is made by the hero to end the domestic violence in his house or to curb his greedy mom and her likes from trying to get the highest market value for the boy. Bollwood should make an attempt to be more responsible, as the masses in India are heavily influenced by what they project as acceptable norms. Personally, I was very disappointed with the movie. Come on people we are in the 21st century, just adding more bold kissing scenes is not enough."
