" A Dark Masterpiece",""A dark masterpiece"! That is all what I can say about this movie. A ruthless, cruel, violent graphical depiction of the almost forgotten 1971 genocide happened in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) by Pakistani Army where almost 3 million people were killed and 4 lakh women were raped. It is hard to believe this is Mrityunjay Devvrat's debut film! This movie is not for the faint hearted, the "A" really means something here. Forget about the other horrific torture on human being, sudden scenes like two pakistani soldiers are casually shooting cows as they loose a bet or the captured women prisoners are thrown out from the trucks like unused materials will send shiver down your spine. It is unthinkable how absolute power can bring us down so low and human can perform such unthinkable acts to other fellow human being in the name of country, religion, language. I have never seen such brutal and explicit depiction of rape after "Bandit Queen", a weapon used by pakistani Army to destroy the morale of common men. Indranil, Raima,Tilottoma were OK, Victor was impressive in a small role and Farooq Seiq was very good as an undercover leader of one of the Muktiyodha(Freedom figher) gang. RIP Farooq Seikh sir, we will miss you. However for me the superstars were Rafiq and his sister Kausar (I forgot to note their actual names, sorry about that), the protective brother and elder sister, what a performance they have given! And yes, Pavan malhotra as the cruel Pakistani general is really outstanding, he, in some cases reminded me of Stoph Waltz who played the infamous SS Col. Hans Landa in the movie "Inglorious Basterds". In the movie we have three stories running in parallel (Raima-Indranil, a journalist and his wife whose lives were massacred by the Pak army, a brother and sister who are the only survivors in their village and Victor who is trying to lead his villagers to a safe place and of course the freedom movement) which finally will merge. The background score was also fine. This movie is not for the masses, so it will definitely not do a good business in box office, but certainly will be appreciated in many forums. 8/10 from me." 
" a must watch","The story unfolds the dark pages of history Most of it unknown to the new gen Compelling - A must watch Set in the 1970s, the film follows three separate stories during the Bangladesh War, during which time thousands of women were raped and millions of people were killed. As the film progresses towards its climax, the three stories begin to intertwine with one another This movie is an attempt to bring out the ugly truth about the war. It is an expression of the double standards of bystanders and those who continue to shut their eyes or say nothing today not wanting to shed light or stop to think about gruesome side to the war. This film is a small tribute to all those victims of this unparalleled barbarity" 
" A film haunting you for days","I have seen CHILDREN OF WAR and stayed captivated, focused on it. it took me days to get rid of the atmosphere of the film. I am shamed I didn't know anything about the History of the birth of Bangladesh, about these 400 000 ladies raped for months. It is very violent, but not really ON the screen, everything is suggested, i was touched deeply about the story of these ladies i couldn't sleep for days. I think the world should learn about this. In 1971, the U.S was in the Hippies movement, dancing, taking drugs, enjoying life while such horrible things where happening! The director was able to mix delicateness & violence, hope & desperation, cruelty & love. It is a master piece movie, a kind of film that gives all its nobles to what we call CINEMA as an ART: transcending, informing, transporting to Human deep philosophical questions. Thanks to all this great team to have been able to achieve such a great film! (sorry my English is not so good as i am a french citizen)" 
" an amazing movie but not for the people who cant stomach any gore","now this movie is a perfect example of a historical movie.the depictions in the movie are really soul wrenching and it achieves its goal of coming a full circle by threading together all the characters and events introduced along the time line which seem almost unrelated till the end of the movie.Loved the spectrum of human love depicted the love of a patriot for his country,of a husband for his wife,of a brother for his sister which are contrasted by hate loathe and oppression .there are many who don't agree as it can be seen by the ratings but the flak received by this movie for its gore and patriarchal approach don't seem valid to me as that was the truth of that era. in the end it is a must watch movie" 
" The appreciable thought & craft is there but the soul & impact goes completely missing in this painfully long attempt.","Not many film-makers have dared to make a film on 1971's Bangladesh war of independence, showcasing those nine long months of untold brutal killings, rapes, painful sufferings and hatred spread over the region resulting in a big genocide. The subject no doubt remains controversial involving the Pakistan military till date and therefore debutant director Mrityunjay Devrat truly deserves appreciation for making this extremely difficult choice of subject for his very first film boldly.However as far as the execution is concerned, at one end he positively displays a fine understanding of the subject, shot taking, ambiance and the art of extracting good performances from the cast skillfully. But on the other, falls short of creating the desired impact, missing the basic soul of the film, which has to be a focused, well written script delivering the content impressively. So, yes the film does score at various levels as a rare attempt in the War-genre, yet it fails to emotionally connect with the viewer largely, despite being based on a shocking & eye-opener theme of Bangladesh's struggle for freedom.Revolving around four fictional stories of that particular nine months connecting with each other, we have a journalist turning into a revolutionary after his wife's rape and kidnap, taking her into a prisoner's camp. A brother & sister, trying to cross the border into India, an old man leading his fellow villagers towards a safe passage and a rebel leader planning hidden attacks on Pakistani military men through his small revolutionary group. Beginning with an actual video footage of Mrs. Indira Gandhi (then Prime Minister of India), the film straight goes into the interconnected stories without properly explaining the basic premise of the massacre in any details (through a voice over or else). And this is what causes a big confusion in the minds of the young viewers who are not actually familiar of the shameful history in details. Incidentally I felt the same while hearing the whispers among some youngsters sitting on my adjoining seat, who were not at all aware of any of the names taken in the film like Mukti Bahini, Bhutto and Yahya Khan.So the less (or no) explanation of the factors actually responsible for the war becomes the first hindrance in the path of making a direct connect with the viewers. Plus it's the painfully long duration crossing 160 minutes of bloody sequences which becomes too much after a while, ruining its overall impact and seriousness altogether. Moreover, there is an imbalance visible in the chosen cast too wherein Pavan Malhotra, Raima Sen, Tillotama Shome and Riddhi Sen are exceptional in their respective roles but Victor Bannerjee is unable to leave an impact along with Indraneil Sengupta &Rucha Inamdar looking less intense and involved than required. Also the veteran Late Farooque Shaikh seems to be a complete misfit in the role of a violent rebel.In short, "CHILDREN OF WAR - Nine Months To Freedom" certainly has an important message to give through some of its upsetting; emotional sequences depicting the ruthless crimes committed against the innocent people, particularly the women. But unfortunately the film also suffers hugely due to a lengthy-uninteresting flow, weak script and inexpressive narration unable to convey the core message convincingly. It has some earnest performances well canned by a noteworthy cinematography, but also has a loud background score incorporating a rock feel unnecessarily. In other words the film is horrifically tense (working in parts), yet lacks the real depth which has to be the key feature of movies made on such thoughtful themes of War Crimes.And I seriously wish it had that satisfying execution to leave an everlasting impact (as generated by its promo), since similar war crimes are being committed even in 2014 (as per the latest news of Boko Haram) and many are still unaware of such humiliating, inhuman acts..........., living their own unaffected lives in the other parts of the world happily." 
" A Masterpiece!","Astonishing that a first time Director, Producer and Music Director came up with this movie. What is even more astonishing is that they have done it independently in spite of all the odds stacked against them and Bollywood is ignoring them.I saw this film in IFFI Goa and was amazed at the quality of storytelling. The scene where the girl is on a boat and blind Durga dances are best in Cinema and make Children of War better than Schindler's List.When will our country learn? This is real talent not that **** **** that plays for four weeks in the Cinema. I think all film schools will buy this movie and show students how real cinema is made.Thank you for this gift. Looking forward to next." 
" Great Historical Movie","Hats f to this film and the maker Mr.Mrityunjay Devrat and all of the members who made this film awesome. I did not thought i'll love this film. I am Bangladeshi and a dreamer. Whenever I read and think about Bangladesh freedom fight 1971 and all the peoples who gave life and the children's and woman's who were raped, killed and tortured by those Pakistani monsters, pictured the whole situation in mind only and always hope if any one can make a perfect movie on this 1971 Genocide attack, the whole bloody 9 months. One morning just opened a TV for watching typical boring serials. Suddenly I saw, a film named "Children of war"!! Felt not that much excited, because I thought this film will not reach my hope like other freedom fighting films. But,, I have no idea about when I continued watching it my eyes wear full of tears. It felt like, I was there too, watching my sister and mother getting raped by those Hayena monsters. " Children Of Wars"... you make me fell that pain again which I should remember everyday. Thank you so much to all of you." 
" Childish attempt on a sensitive subject","I praise producer and director Mr. Mritunjay Devvrat for choosing this issue but can't even say a good thing about the film. All visualization and emotions remained in directors mind only. Screenplay and dialogues are pathetic. If you don't know about the backdrop of this film then you wont be able to find out the reason behind every things happening. You wont get touched with a single scene even. Subject is so dark that I was apprehensive about watching the film but promo and trailer pulled me to the theater but I got very disappointed with the final product. Such type of mistake often happens when one person holds two biggest post, producer and director and even first timer. Then you never realizes that when you have crossed the thin line between confidence and over confidence . Director is so obsessed with some typical metaphors that he did too much, i.e every person died while keeping their eyes open, suddenly rain and thunder appears for a dramatic scene, for this purpose he does not mind to keep the continuity intact. Scene opens in day and transforms into night. He has shown only one Pak Army Camp and they use cinematic lights to light there camp!!? What type of camp this was? Key source of light is Lantern in a scene but lighting of scene is so bad that you don't feel the need of lantern. Performance wise all actors are just OK. Music slows down the film especially which has Bengali lyrics." 
" this is call a real movie on 1971 Bangladesh genocide","I am Bangladeshi and I know the maker of this film he is not Bangladeshi. But, Bangladeshi peoples and media and the fdc film producers & directors, should be thanking the director of this film, Mrityunnjay devrat. He showed in this film what disgusting things happened for 9 months in my country in your country. No he' is creating an awesome opportunity to show some respect Internationally who sacrificed their family daughter, child, father, everything. should Friends and families from Bangladesh or from any other countries, who slightly knows about the biggest 1971 genocide, lets share what we think about our motherland Bangladesh. lets try to do good justices with those Bengali peoples souls,who were raped, tortured and killed by those Pakistani Hyena's. I need your support friends please. children of war revels The ugliest but the true stories behind of 1971 genocide. This is not only Bangladeshi history now. its a world history now. So, support this film. I am supporting thins film because, I have respects for those peoples, who were raped, killed and god give their souls peace." 
" Heart wrenching movie showcasing human cruelty that is little too long","Any interpretation or depiction of any war or acts of terror is extremely hard and tough for director to showcase in cinematic form. Question always is how little its too much and Mrityunjay Devvrat's  has done an excellent job of that in his debut movie.Children of war is graphical beautiful depiction of the almost forgotten 1971 genocide happened in East Pakistan. The scenes to tend to get uncomfortably gory and long and I would think that the movie overall would have benefited from a shorter script. It's a long depressing watching genocides for more than two hours. Sadly, enough the 1971 genocides have been forgotten and most of the younger generation are clueless about the sufferings. The movie could have benefited if they had put some context for today's generation.The actors are par excellent and all have done an excellent job. I especially was fascinated by Pawan Malhotras evil, cruel, ruthless Pakistani General. Pawan finally got an opportunity to show his true talent.Director has done an amazing job for first time holding the baton and I really look forward to seeing more movies from him. Music score was OK but little too loud and took away from the moments at times.The movie would have done lot better if it was shorter and crisper." 
" A very laid back dark dark movie about an unbelievably dark time in human history","This is a long film. So not everyone may find the duration convenient. The film is set in the liberation war that led to the formation of Bangladesh. In the actual war, the first targets of the occupying Pakistani troops were the non-Muslim segments of the population. In particular the Hindu community was decimated by summary executions and extensive organized rapes by Pakistani soldiers. This, however is not brought out in the film. Instead it focuses on the story of a Bengali Muslim family that supports independence from Pakistan. The reasons for this support are not laid out clearly. Thus, none of the drama about the Bengali win in the elections that were not honored due to reservation of West Pakistani elites is depicted. Instead one learns about the already set in place move towards freedom from Pakistan as well as what appear to be Muslim fundamentalists who support the rule by West Pakistanis, who are the collaborators. The actual war of independence was a complex affair that required enormous suffering by Bengalis as well as involved China, Pakistan, India, US and USSR together with the International Media. This aspect is hinted at weakly but not brought out. The dramatic collapse of the Pakistani Army is also not made clear. Now with all of this you may be tempted to say, may be another film will do all this. That would be a mistake because the conduct of the Pakistani army in full glare of International media was so horrific that it easily qualified as genocide. They, however, got away free. The story brings out the impunity and the knowledge of it by the diplomatic corps and the media but that not much could be done due to warped calculations--the movie does not clarify whose, but history tells us it was Nixon, Kissinger, China filling in the parts. In that respect, it has a Kafkaesque feel where wrongs are being done in an disinterested benign manner by State forces and the individual has no real value. The film brings this out wonderfully. It is best appreciated if one goes in expecting this aspect rather than a detailed telling of history. I recommend it highly to all those who like well researched and nuanced films." 
" Promises a lot but delivers very less.","This film really start of well. Some of the scenes were really spine chilling. But as the story progress. It goes nowhere.This film start with an interview of Indira Gandhi and showing the India's point of view. And I kept waiting till the very end to watch some kind of participation by Indian army during the gorilla warfare and later during conventional warfare. But the film just seem to be getting lost. Instead we were watching prisoner stealing arms from Pakistani cantonment and giving to Mukti Bahini and again coming back to prison. Moving in and out just like moving in her balcony.Film just chose to show numerous rape and murder scenes in very detail instead of developing any story. All the 3 parallel stories generate lots of interest but end aimlessly. I liked the story of brother and sister story and their effort to reach Indian border. their experience of violence was well shown. But then suddenly changed tract to spiritual Goddess Durga and all lost its realism and effect. End of the story very predictable with bit of melodrama.This film had a great star-cast who performed really very well. But they completely wasted. At the end film says that there were more than 40,000 rapes committed by Pakistani Army. I thank God that director had only 160 minutes to make this film. Or-else he might tortured us showing 40,000 rapes in detail.Overall I would say very ordinary movie just one time watch if u have not of options." 
" To me its a Sexual movie and low quality direction","This movie destroy the main plot of the 1971 liberation war.They only give importance on rape rather than the main story.I thought they will show lots of things they Pakistani did with Bangladesh that time but their story make me disappointed.Songs are very low quality.Only i can say every rape scene was perfect.Its the only good things of this movie.They show some fake story which wasn't possible that time.anyway i will give only 1 out of 10.Please don't spoil next time about any countries history.You took good actors but the story wasn't good at all.Sometime i lost on the story that where i m.Moreover some shot were really funny." 
" Gory account of 1971 Bangladeshi genocide","Children of War is based on the 1971 Bangladesh genocide which highlights the atrocities of Pakistan Army on Bangladeshis. The story is a work of fiction with background setting of real events taking place during the genocide. Various lives are captured in the movie to display the struggle of ordinary people under the Pakistani regime. A young couple getting separated where the husband (Indraneil Sengupta), a journalist is writing on Army's brutal acts and Bangladeshi independence and who refuses to toe the line with army generals. His wife (Raima Sen) is raped and imprisoned in a rape camp. There is another story of a small kid and his sister, the only inhabitants of their village, and the quest of the brother to safely transport his sister to Indian border.The movie is a half attempt to capture the terrifying events which occurred during Bangladesh independence. Pavan Malhotra, does justice to his role of a Pakistani Colonel along with other cast. I feel Farooque Sheikh's role has been a mis-cast and could have been done by a lesser gentlemanly character. In-spite of being a 168 min movie, there is less attention to detailing and all the references/ acts are cursory in nature. The movie could have been brilliant had it cut short the music and elongated scenes for a fast paced detailed story."
