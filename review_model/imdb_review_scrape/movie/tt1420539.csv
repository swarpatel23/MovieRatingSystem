" utter nonsense","This is one comedy movie that doesn't make you laugh. 'Ek Se Bure Do' is a terrible movie. Problems with 'Ek Se Bure Do' are aplenty with the biggest being that there is no storyline whatsoever. The director would struggle if asked to give a two line synopsis of the film.The film has a treasure hunt as the central theme but not once in the film does one see anyone going after the treasure. They're all after a map that leads to a mysterious treasure and try outwitting each other through the film. The second half is somewhat taken from Andaz Apna Apna.Rajpal Yadav and Arshad Warsi are wasted. Don't know what makes them sign this movie. Just don't even dare to think of wasting your precious time, money and energy on this one."
