" Oh my gosh! Is it humanly possible to make such a stupid film?","I had to give 1 star because there is no lower possible rating. I don't know what sajid khan thinking or (fully drunk) when he made this movie. Did he watch it himself before releasing it? If he did watch it, and still release it, he takes us to be absolutely dumb idiots.Have you ever tried tickling someone very hard to make him laugh? Well, it felt that way. Only it wasn't tickly, but painful! All the situations, gags, jokes were warped and senseless. I'd rather spend 3 hours watching ants crawling.The only saving grace was was chunky pandey. His gags did make me smile occasionally. Anyway, I think it is a waste of time writing about the movie. Only, I feel terrible for the unwary ones who are planning to go to watch it." 
" Worst Movie of a Lifetime","Rotten tomatoes would had been a better option than Housefull 2.If Housefull was crap then Housefull 2 is a crap train.Its full of isolated non sense stuff that transcends the requirement of a filmmaking.Nowadays producers know a secret formula....Skinshow and India's ever increasing population. They know that India is such as place where there would never be any investment for hockey fields bu rather a whole lot of money will be thrown away to set up multiplexes to welcome movies like Houseful 2 & Players.Even though its way short of everything except non sense India is that country who would even stampede in order to run to theaters and get an early seat to watch these movies.I would go for N/10 - Non Sense"

" BEST MOVIE in 2012 so far :)","I expected a lot from this movie and MY Expectations - worked! This movie is totally-entertaining-movie, I've seen till now in 2012.Akshay's acting is just GREAT. Then comes, JOHN ABRAHAM - never seen him doing this type of ROLE before, I must say he is very talented! There comes Ritesh and Shreyas - they did marvelous job for small period of time :D Female actors supported a lot for this movie and again they rocked the movie too :D Rishi and Randhir kapoor were total-funpack-brothers in this movie, the nonsense they made, they did and they do are like JUST TOO ENTERTAINING! Here comes, Ranjeet sir who just took movie to a new level in just small ROLE.. Yes thats right! Short ROLE! But the best :D Story is well written, direction is perfect for bolly-comedy-movies, songs are catchy, casting is PERFECT and locations were unbelievable! GREAT CHOICE :D I missed Aakhri pasta (Chunky Pandey) a looot in this movie! His role was just for short period of time :("Fiffy (Or whatever the spelling is) and Nagraj - the two animals-scene were EPIC :D"Some people will try to find LOGIC in this movie. But then COMEDY is to make people laugh not to find LOGICS or some real stuff in it ;) ENTERTAINING MOVIE and had fun after looooong period of time :DVote: 9/10!" 
" Horrible","The much anticipated movie turned out to be the real disappointment. I do not understand what these people are trying to project from such movies ? I went with an anticipation of light comedy without using brain but since the movie made my brain go numb, I took a nap in between. Too many loose strings and plots and sub-plots and sub-plots without any relevance among themselves lead to ultimate confusion and in between I was searching for some laughing material which never came till the end.All the talented actors have been wasted under poor direction from Sajid Khan. No continuity, no screenplay and even the songs suck.Do not waste the money, even if you have plenty ! Because your brain damage will be more expensive affair." 
" What an ENTERTAINER!!!","Housefull 2 , as the title says , theaters were also Housefull. People were coming out laughing , few were on the floor holding their stomach. And i , was waiting there thinking - "oh my god , let me in fast ." So the plot is like this - "Housefull 2 opens in London with a sibling rivalry between Daboo Randhir Kapoor who is a impermissible but given a part of his father's business and Chintu Rishi Kapoor who is bitterly resentful.This bitterness seeps across the house as Chintu's daughter Heena Asin Thottumkal and Daboo's daughter Bobbie Jacqueline Fernandez at each others throats.Each brother wants to marry his daughter to Tycoon JD's Mithun Chakraborty son Jolly Ritesh Deshmukh who is in love with full-figured model JLo Zarine Khan but is too terrified to tell his daddy, who is striding across his English castle in a starched dhoti, a tycoon who smiles frostily only at Vishwas Patil Johnny Lever. Marriage fixer Aakhri Pasta Chunky Pandey brings an eligible match to Chintu, but playing a vinegary uncle with tang, Kapoor insults the father - with offensive 'African jokes' - landing him in hospital. His son Jai/Jolly Shreyas Talpade swears revenge, begging buddy Jwala/Jolly to romance Chintu's daughter, then break it off - but jittery Jwala/Jolly drags in muscular Max John Abraham to have him play 'Jolly', employing sleazy Sunny Akshay Kumar for the other brother to get the same.The rival Jolly-boys enjoy purani dushmani - but that's forgotten with two hot girls, a crocodile and a desert island.Yet, some starvation for the clueless girls ensures love and soon, there are four pairs - and four Jolly's hotting things up.With each Punjabi Papa - and one Batuk Patel Boman Irani (all dimples and nasal inflexion, father of Parul Shazahn Padamsee ,Jai/Jolly 's sweetheart - with more bikinis than lines) - vying for Jolly, the 'dirty dozen' reaches JD's house. But they're walking on water here. JD's got a temper, a dark secret - and a gun.Will the dirty dozen get what they Wye for??? or JD will save the couples from the dirty dozen???"Performances - Akshay Kumar at his best , Special Mention for Rietesh and John. Asin was good.My reaction at the movie - I was laughing my ass out sitting on my chair.Public reaction - everyone knows its awesome. My advise - don't believe the lame reviewsOverall - 9/10. Entertainers like these , come only once !" 
" Funny & Entertaining!","A sequel to the 2010 Hit, Housefull, 'Housefull 2', Directed by Sajid Khan, is a Funny & Entertaining Film, that lives up-to the mark. Its Paisa-Vasool Entertainment, that never pretends to be anything else. 'Housefull 2' tells the story of four fathers, four daughters and four prospective sons-in-law. Each father wants his daughter to marry the richest son-in-law. Each daughter thinks she is marrying the richest son-in-law. Each son-in-law is pretending to be the richest son-in-law. However, none of these people can stand each other and all of them are under one roof, in one house. 'Housefull 2' is hilarious in parts. The First-Hour entertains, while the Second-Hour, when all the characters come under one roof, is equally entertaining & funny. Even the climax, though loud, its arresting. The Screenplay progresses rapidly & each character is memorable. Sajid Khan's Direction is fine. Music by Sajid-Wajid, is fabulous. Performance-Wise: Mithun is a delight to watch. His portions stand out, thanks to his performance. Rishi Kapoor & Randhir Kapoor are funny. Akshay Kumar is always dependable when it comes to comedy, and he does well yet again. John Abraham is ordinary, while Ritesh Deshmukh & Shreyas Talpade are only getting better. Boman Irani scores big time in a small role. Asin Thottumkal does a decent job. Jacqueline Fernandez, Zarine Khan & Shazahn Padamsee get very limited scope. Chunky Pandey & Johnny Lever bring the house down, they are impeccable. Ranjeet's Cameo, is fun. On the whole, 'Housefull 2' is a complete entertainer, that's not meant to be taken too seriously. Go, Have Fun!" 
" Jolly Bad","Sajid Khan should try his luck in Las Angeles. He made an Above Average which turned out to be a Block Buster than came Housefull which was plain average but again a block buster. Now with housefull 2 his wish to make disgusting movie is fulfilled. But again a super hitThis is the most confusing movie ever in world cinema. It makes a complete mockery of cinema. Their is no plot in the movie to discuss, but again this a brainless comedy. Now is this a comedy movie. It doesn't make you laugh in fact it is an acid test for your funny bone. If someone can laugh in this movie than he should not watch great comedy or he will die laughing. Performance wise Akshay did the great job but lines are so bad that he won't make you laugh. John is not good at comedy but he tried his best. Ritesh is as he is. Shreyas is a good actor and he deserve better role. Pity here is that Rishi Kapoor who has just given an outstanding Do Dooni Chaar and Agneepath is given a worst character to play. Randhir Kapoor is an average actor but again his character is similar to Rishi's. Mithun is brilliant but he is not their to make you laugh. Boman has 10mins role. Sorry but no need to tell about actresses. I wonder when will Sajid deliver flop as I want him to come back to hosting shows. But no time soon as he is delivering blockbusters. This movie is no better than some c grade comedies like Buddha mar Gaya or Chatur Singh." 
" Housefull 2-Must watch don't go for the lame reviews","Well Before i left for the movie,I did check out the reviews.Which Summarized Stay away from the movie,Its sucks.Don't go with that review. Believe Me the movie is good.Paisa Wasool. Of-course,For people who say it sucks.Keep your Brains in your pocket and go to this movie.Just to Enjoy. What film makes the whole Theater Laugh like they never have??This Movie did(This Movie did after a gap of 1 year of lame movies like tees mar khan etc). Well Before the Interval i say you will not stop laughing,You might be scared even to eat some popcorn.Well after the interval.,.It is little bit bragged,And it might even lead to confusion to some people.But still there some good hearty laughs in the second half. They Do have some 1-2 silly/lame jokes. But overall i say go For it.Don't Miss this Movie This is One Great Comedy movie After a whole 1 year" 
" A Pretty Mindless Comedy","I hated house full n the only reason for watching this movie was free tickets and a weekend on which i had nothing interesting to do.. where should i start..?? the movie has no plot..it looks like the sajid khan's idea of a plot is to just fill the screen with many people and ask them to shout at their top of the voice.. as the movie says the so called "Dirty Dozens" aren't impressive at all.. rishi kapoor after a riveting performance in Agneepath disappoints by doing such a silly role..and the worse acting belonged to john abraham.. his cheesy one liners were pathetic..someone has to say to him he isn't good at comedy..while akshay was good in parts and the other two were passable..coming to the actresses, they had less to do with acting but more with skin show.. they were only two positives of this film chunky pandey and the veteran johnny lever.. a lame movie that doesn't deserves to be watched on big screen.." 
" A highly LOW IQ Movie","I was expecting better comedy since literally wasted $10 on a ticket for Housefull 1 Thank God Housefull II I watched on laptop and couldn't watch after 40 minutes .. mY favorite actor is John but WOW what a waste of talent.... Most PATHETIC MOVIE of 2012! With Sajid's looks deteriorating, his film levels are also...The guy has NO sense.. looks worst and worst day by day..and thinks he is the God of movies... Someone please give him an electric shock to bring him back to his senses.... Feel sorry for Akshay... what a career... giving flops after flops and yet still sitting there holding on tight! Salute!" 
" a conspiracy","Housefull 2 is a conspiracy against the audience. They lure us into the audience with a big cast, and then tortured us with an array of forcible jokes and extremely flat dialogues.This is a record-breaking movie- it has the worst performances of the careers of the whole cast. A good sequence is rarer than a blue moon.The only time, the audience is relieved from the pain is when it reacts to Mallika Arora. And then, the torture begins again. So much so that, there are cries of anguish during the elongated climax.One has just two questions to ask of housefull-2- Why and what. Why was this movie ever made? and what was it, a movie or a satire on human sense of humour? Assuming some movies are a no-brainer and tender only to the funny nerve. But this movie requires you to keep all the senses of human experience at home. Thats the only way to endure this 3-hour session of trauma." 
" Eye candy.","i was actually apprehensive as to whether i would watch the movie till the end, or switch off my DVD player ,without waiting to see the end ! How ever, except for the last fifteen-twenty minutes of some stupid melodrama,of Jaggu aka JD undergoing a change of heart, and all friends turned into foes ,turning friends again, i was surprisingly not bored while watching this More-the -Merrier fun.According to me, the script writer, director or even the producer, do not claim for any high levels of IQ,or any sensibilities, while they came up with the idea of producing this movie.The team basically seem to have only one goal in their minds, and that was to present actors like Akshay and Abraham, who are an eye candy for female viewers, and those four beauties, who would please the male viewers, in their fashionable scanty attires.One can enjoy all the dance numbers, the music is superb, the locations are pleasing to the eye, and most of the scenes like the python grabbing Talpade's private parts, or Fifi the pet crocodile chasing Akki and Ritesh.Out of the current lot, Akshay gives a good account of himself,not only in comedy, but some excellent fights and stunts. Abraham is average, Shreyas is good, Ritesh looks tired and bored, mostly due to his role, and Asin is quite at ease,looks pretty.It's Rishi again, who is brilliant in his comedy, and delivers his dialogs with such gusto.Mithunda and Johny make a good pair, and the use of Marathi liners are well-written and delivered.How ever, Boman and Chunky were avoidable, due to their loud acting.Ranjit the rapist ! Good to see this veteran actor of yesteryears in a cameo, as Akshay's father.And yes, the flop hero Dabboo, too, was avoidable.i was surprised with the good quality dialogs written for this movie.Editing keeps up the tempo, filmography is pleasant, and locations have been chosen thoughtfully.Worth-watching once , either at theater,with loads of popcorn, or at home, with enough snacks,if you are thoroughly bored, and nothing better to do !" 
" Housefull 2","Awesome ..........a wonderful comedy with very much fabulous dialogues....really enjoyed this movie.Thanks to the director and all the actors.Anarkali item number is too good.Its a movie not to be missed.Thrilling performance by all actors i must say.Johnny Lever's too cool ... especially the dialogues delivered by him.Nice shooting locations.I liked the python and crocodile scenes...what a fun!!! Iam really thankful to the directors for giving a wonderful movie like housefull 2.Akshay Kumar's "kamina" action is highly appreciated as well as Asin.Ritiesh deshmukh ..wonderful performance by him.Malaika Arora was too hot and appreciative for her dance Finally, thanks and hats off to the wonderful singers for this movie...sunidi chauhan, Wajid, shaan and others... thank you" 
" Wht a movie","thanks to my laptop that i din't wasted ma money on Housefull 2...it doesn't worth big screen.... i still din't get whether movie was serious ,sad,funny,romantic,action or a thriller...actresses used fr skin show... actors acted like we r kids an will laugh by their awful actions... movie needs some sort of story dude...how come u fool house with your Housefull... its sad that because of this crap more movies will follow the formula of no story movie like after daubing series of funny action movies was startd....an we were gifted by sing ham,bodyguard etc etc...in short the good thing i movie was the use of colors...feeling pity for the people who liked the movie...... skip it!!!" 
" They House Fooled every one","Give my friends Money Back ,He was HouseFooled By you ,we want to watch other movieMy friend went to watch this movie and he regret it still now , he went to watch the movie and started crying as he was tortured by the movie , then he started banging his head on seat and started crying loudly , he not wanted to go out as he spent Rs 80 on movies so he slept then he became very happy as movie ended he started dancing with joy and came out , when i asked him what you watched he told , i don't know , That s HOUSE FOOL , then he told me the story what had happened to him , now we had a plan we gave one ticket to our biggest enemy , then we started following him we were standing outside movie hall and miracle happened 2 employees of movie theater were dragging him out of theater you want to know why , because he lost his mind , as he was watching film the film tortured him so much that he started wandering in theater there he saw on couple were doing there honey moon so he went too , then song started "Papa to band Jaye " then his husband kicked him , now he had nothing to do rather than watch the film so he started throwing any which came in his hand (shoes on screen)then he spitted on screen then he wanted to pee on screen and he opened his zip and stared pee on"
