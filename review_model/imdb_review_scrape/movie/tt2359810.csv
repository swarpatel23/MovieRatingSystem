" Lovely movie","Lovely movie, it had a twist and a blend of action, drama, romance, a little bit fiction too. The movie is worth a watch. it displays the actuality of the people, their nature and all i loved the romantic part of the movie as well. it was fun, interesting and very very entertaining too. I seriously recommend it to be watched. it has a little bit abuses which aren't suitable for a child's attention. if you are looking for a movie to watch for fun, to cry, to feel love, experience pain,i am pretty astonished about "Dhanush" as this was his first movie in the Bollywood and he made his mark pretty high. People it must be watched at least once, and i am very sure about going to the cinemas to see it again Enjoy, It is not something either that will get you bored during the movie. The movie has brilliant direction, acting. For me its a 11/10" 
" Love and its many shades","Dhanush who had earlier wooed the South Indian audience with his acting skills, chose a script tailor made for him to launch himself into Bollywood. The movie, doesn't disappoint those who enjoyed the stories where love stands above everything else in life. To top it all, when you have ARR weaving his magic with some sublime music, the beauty of Banaras just comes alive in front of your eyes. The three main characters, all have their own shades of grey and more often than not they stem from Love. Sonam for once does justice to her role, she grew into her role as the movie progressed and gave a telling performance that she could reflect back with pride. Abhay was as flawless as ever, just easing through his role with nonchalant ease. It would only be fair if i end where I started - Dhanush simply stole the show with his intense portrayal of a person driven by love, a person who does the most stupid, brave and incomprehensible of things in the name of love. My Verdict: Expect a love story with a traditional characterization supported by some brilliant music and clean performances by the lead cast - you won't be disappointed." 
" Well done Dhanush!","What is different about this movie? Dhanush. An ordinary looking actor from the Tamil Film Industry. And what has he done? He has very easily managed to carry the entire film on his two shoulders. Not an easy task, but he has done it. Reason? His immense talent and experience. Not once did I feel bored watching him act flawlessly. Sonam Kapoor is another surprise package of this movie. She has also acted very well. If she wants to be taken seriously as an actor, she must do roles with meat like the one in this movie. Abhay Deol has a guest appearance which he has performed well as expected. I was sceptical about this movie but was I surprised! I am glad I went and watched this movie in a theatre. Money well spent I must say. I wont give away anything about the story in my review. I'll just say, please go and watch the movie in a theatre. And last but not the least, I want to say, "Well done Dhanush, Welcome to Hindi Film Industry!"." 
" Romantic saga with desi flavor","Well, I will not start with telling about story as it will spoil the fun for the people who haven't seen the movie or will see in the future, but I can see it is already spoiled here. 1> But I have to start with story which is extremely interwoven together. Now a days when people talk about first half and second half which doesn't matter according to me. Story has all the elements be it fun, romance, drama and it has a classic desi Indian touch with it because movie is based in varansi which gives it a flavor with its crispy language, people, ethnicity. Its pleasure to watch reality in the movie when all the movies releasing are masala shits.2> If music is given by A.R. Rahman there is no point talking about it. Mucic was flowing like butter.3> Performances are best like characters are meant for them. Dhanush is awesome in his performance. He is a delight to watch. The way he delivers his dialogues is super cool and his accent has a roughness and his south Indian accent doesn't interferes with his Hindi accent. Sonam looks sober and does her part with full conviction, Supporting cast especially Kundan's friend "Murari" is fun to watch.4> Dialogues has everything from catchphrases, roughness to desi gaaliyan of UP.Overall, it is a very good film after such a long time as we don't come across these days in bollywood :)" 
" Dhanush all the way!","What can I say? I went to watch this movie after reading all the reviews online - Therefore with high expectations. Well, I was still blown over by the movie or should I say DHANUSH! Ranjhanaa is based on a topic that is so far reaching and yet is that much more realistic! Every scene is delicately handled and the emotional parts were so subtle.Everyone in the screen just melted away and got hazy when Dhanush was in it. He makes you laugh, cry, hate him, and sympathize with him at the same time. AR Rahman's music was divine and seamlessly blended with the storyline. Excellent performances by the whole cast - But Dhanush owns the movie! A definite must watch!!!" 
" movie with its heart in right place..... Outstanding effort.","simply marvelous.... especially from a movie where d hero has so very unorthodox looks for a Bollywood actor but,wait ...u will forget that as d story moves on beautifully crafted on screen by the "tanu weds manu"(another interesting flick)director n acted upon by same guy.. Dis movie belongs to him only( heard he was d youngest recipient of the national award for the best actor down south) ... Dhanush with his simplistic looks,so very expressive face n true act oozes life in his on screen character.. With his earthly charm,he truly has carved out a niche for himself.. The director has succeeded once again in portraying our U.P. in such beautiful colors,capturing the mood n by-lanes of the people of eastern U.P. with gr8 detail.. Complemented by the so very fresh n beautiful sonam who seems like is going to dethrone d ladies at the top!!! Look for the dhanush's friend,a kin in all weathers,his sis who truly adores the local lad and not to forget abhay... In all, the director has managed to bring out the potential in every actor and has given the viewer some meaningful work.. Worth mentioning are the dialogues too which will both make u both laugh and give something to think about,kudos man.... and the soulful tunes to laud the effort by d Mozart from chennai ... worth a 2nd watch, meaningful one sided love story.... Majestic.." 
" Love -- With A Different View !!","Raanjhanaa, what can I say about the film!! As an avid film buff I have compel to write this bollywood movie review. It's an unique movie, so bollywood but so unique and refreshing! It is a definitive multi-layered story woven beautifully with a great but complex script.Script is complex, multi-layered but transparent to viewer. It starts from boy meets girl and narrates philosophy, dedication, progression of life with love. And how it turns to an unique love story that should not be missed.The editing is very good at first half, but it should be more stringent in the second half. Cinematography is marvelous, Baranasi can be this beautiful? then you have to watch it.Songs and lyrics woven beautifully in the story. You can not side-line the songs and watch the movie; it is practically lyrical story. AR Rehman creates a blend of true Indian flavored music here.Dialogues are also playing a crucial part in the film. From witty to cliché, from orthodox to unorthodox, it varies and triumphs.When you are seeing the acting of the film, Dhanush has really become Kundan. Dhanush never existed in this film, only Kundan has. That should sum up the acting depth infused in the film as Kundan. Welcome Dhanush to bollywood. Sonam is beautiful and well enacted the role. She is more compelling towards ending of the film.Another advantage director uses in his film that is supporting actors. Special mention to Murari(Kundan's friend) and Bindiya. Both have the best one-liners of the film and their acting was just apt. Abhay Deol is also good.Director Mr. Rai presents you a story with great attributes. Celebrate, cheers, empathizes and of course fall in love....with a bit of sacrifice.....Raanjhanaa !!!" 
" A Distinctive Take On Love !!","PROEM: It was an intensely hued picture which showed a young boy standing with a fascinated glance in his eyes & a pretty girl portraying the semblance of cheerfulness amidst the vibrant colors of pink, green, yellow & red; thereby recreating the festival of Holi in a rectangular first look poster of 'Raanjhanaa' !!Colors always attract our eyes.Also I felt curious about the movie after knowing that it belongs to romantic genre.'Love' is probably the only word in a Dictionary which neither can be explained in a sentence nor has any perfect synonyms.Today while watching this love story, I could virtually visualize that thought of Rose Franken: "Anyone can be passionate, but it takes real lovers to be silly.." !! Let me illustrate this journey of 'Raanjhanaa' in the following paragraphs !!MOVIE: Shot in Benaras & Delhi, 'Raanjhanaa' narrates a tale of love through Kundan (Dhanush), Zoya (Sonam Kapoor) & Akram/Jasjeet (Abhay Deol)..Kundan (a Brahmin boy) & Zoya (a Muslim girl) were brought up in Benaras, where Kundan expressed his love for Zoya during his teenage days.After growing up, Zoya took admission in Jawaharlal Nehru University where she fell in love with an university student cum socialist Akram..What happens next forms the crux of the story.'LIKE's: 1) Cinematography by N. Subramanian and Vishal Sinha is astounding + Editing by H. Kothari & Choreography by Bosco-Caesar are impressive + Story/Screenplay by H. Sharma is a bit different than an usual romantic drama + Dialogues are extremely witty at many sequences + Acting by the leading & supporting casts are marvelous + Set design by T. U. Khan is befitting + Direction by Anand L. Rai is appreciable !!2) MUSIC: A big applause to A.R.Rahman for such an wonderful soundtrack (well supported by Irshad Kamil's catchy lyrics) & appropriate background score..For example,a) When Kundan showed his anger on Zoya for the first time, there the synthesizer chords fluctuated in a bizarre way to create the effect of displeasure & it was done repeatedly with different chords to break the harmony, so that audience could better relate to the scene.b) In a gloomy conversation between Kundan & Zoya, where Kundan suddenly felt the ray of hope, he turned up his head towards Zoya..In that split second, Rahman used the rhythm of 'Tabla' in a tricky way to express Kundan's expectation which struck the heart of viewers too !!3) A SPECIAL MENTION TO :a) That scene where Zoya was about to leave Benaras by train with teary eyes & Kundan ran to meet her, multiple water patches were shown in the rail station, as if rain just happened, thereby subconsciously magnified the mood of separation since rains are often attributed to a heavy heart..b) MakeUp Artists for giving Sonam the minimal touch up, which amplified the innocence of a face rather than glamour..Beauty can either flashes the eyes of a beholder like a mid-day sun or soothes the same like a morning dewdrop..Since the latter better suits the character of Zoya, so the lipstick/blusher/eye-shadow even eyeliners were absolutely unnecessary here apart from the marriage scene, where a loud make up was needed & make up experts also did the right job there by painting the line of eye-liner a bit above the corner of eyes + stark red lipstick..'DISLIKE's: Very few are there, for example; 1) In the song 'Tum Tak', the lip movements of Dhanush were not synchronous with the voice of the playback singer..Looked like, the song was coming from a mike & the actor was just singing on his own..2) First half was too romantic & at times, the efforts of Kundan to please Zoya looked silly..In Second half, the focus were more on politics, thereby concentration of romance got diluted by leadership activities..3) Both Dhanush & Sonam looked misfit in the role of school going teenagers + Opening sequence was dull + Too much slapping on Kundan's face by Zoya ultimately invited humor rather than sympathy..That profound scene where Akram's mother was about to touch Kundan's cheek for greeting, I heard some boys laughing crazily behind my seat & saying, "Stop..Stop..No more slapping" !!MESSAGE: There is a lyrics from the musical 'Cinderella' which says: "Do I love you because you're beautiful, Or, are you beautiful because I love you ?" !! One can easily relate this line to those love struck eyes of Kundan which glitter more than the pole star even in the shadow of Zoya..Of late, Zoya fell in love with Akram, because she considered 'Kundan part' as a childlike crush + Akram fitted the bill as per educational & social qualification..From here, the dilemma of selecting a lover/partner arrives, accompanied by a dialogue where Kundan's friend Murari (M. Z. Ayyub) told him that girls are more likely to marry Doctors/Engineers rather than ordinary boys of the same locality, since the question of love comes secondary to their mind..Obviously material satisfaction plays a vital role in such decisions..But, if an abstract force (love) plays a guest appearance in the same scenario & makes one cherish that pleasure somewhat like this: "To the world you might be one person, but to one person you might be the world", then should not one rise above the narrow parameters set by the society/religions ?Once Tom Robbins said: "We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love.." !! Life does not give us multiple chances..In this densely populated sphere of Earth, there is always a scarcity of those persons who can sacrifice his/her deepest desires to bring sunshine in the face of their loved ones..Don't let go that kind heart, if by chance you find him/her..With the mellifluous touch of Shehnai, 'Raanjhanaa' sublimely delivered this tacit message in a pictorial way, making the film worth a watch !!Absolutely Recommended !!" 
" made my day","This is one of those rare breed of movies in Bollywood that dare to go beyond the commercial crowd pleasers. Fortunately we are seeing more of such kind each day. Having said that, this is a highly entertaining paisaa vasool venture with substance. Kudos to the writer and director who gave us the soulful Tanu weds Manu but this time he sets his mark higher.The movie takes you on journey with Kundan who is brilliantly plated by Dhanush right from his school days in Banaras to his ultimate destiny. Its very hard not to feel for the guy and cheer him,laugh with him, feel with him and it definitely makes one nostalgic and teary eyed at the same time.There are many amazing sequences in the film which are so realistic that you can really feel the main man crying,smiling,puking at various stages of the movie.His transformation from a school boy with a crush, through a youth with stubble and only one real goal in life, to an atonement seeking person is palpable. Mind you though its made to be a love story it almost never gets into stereotypes or clichés and keeps us on the edge of the seat with its thrilling twists throughout the course. Of course the main character is aided by a wonderful support cast from his friend Murari who gets the best one-liners, his childhood girlfriend, Abhay deol who plays his role with ease and surprisingly Sonam Kapoor who has dared to do something different & succeeded.But the movies greatest strength is Dhanush who can make you cheer for him even when he's slashing his wrist, or riding is love into the river when he realizes she in love with somebody else.On the flip side his role as a political leader seems over stretched after the racy 1st half and some of the actions of the lead female towards the end are not understandable.All in all if you want to watch desi realistic love story with raw human emotions and unpolished drama here's your chance. Don't miss it!" 
" a great entertainer, with a hint of mystery","Raanjhanaa is easy viewing works thanks to Dhanush's powerful performance with Sonam kapoor & Mohammed Ayyub. A R Rahman's scores once again. The story is complicated yet transparent, one that you may be inclined to feel judgemental about but one that you'll see from different perspective. After the flavour blend in the Kanpur for Tanu Weds Manu, Rai extends his ambitious to introduce the majestic of Varanasi city in this movie with a great blend of love story and moreover, since the film revolves around locals, it doesn't make sense to capture the visuals like some wide-eyed tourist. But the playful hues of Holi and a generally colourful palette that defines the city of temples fills the frames for most part till the story shifts to misty winters in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University campus. CLIMAXXX!!!! A must watch film this season. 4.5/5" 
" This movie belong to DHANUSH !!!","Trust me, This is the 1st time I am writing a review about any movie, I never bothered to write a review but after watching this movie I simply couldn't resist myself to appreciate the work done in this movie.I have to say, no matter how good the story is or the music is if the lead role did not perform his or her acting well then its not going to be a hit.This movie has almost everything.. Music by Sir A.R Rehman which has got the divine power in itself. Good story and Brilliant acting, Specially by this Tamil guy "DHANUSH" what a great actor he is I must say.. The way he has delivered every dialogues is just mind blowing. His face expressions, his body language and his emotions at some parts of the movie is so real that it makes you feel touched. I would say, if you haven't watched this movie yet then you're missing out big time. This movie is worth a watch. specially if you like Romantic or drama movies then this is the one movie for you! I would rate this movie 10/10 and I mean it.. just cause of "DHANUSH"" 
" To love something or someone and destroyed by it completely (Fanaa) is the life's truer eminence, the movie pretty much ends with this concept .","At last done with Raanjhaana (2013)In the end it cannot be considered as typical bollywood cliché love story. Story writer's non-communal thought has been strongly reflected in this film. In past days race, religion was noted as major facts and were responsible for creating discrimination but as day passed thinking of human about race and religion may have changed but human race is still keeping this discrimination alive by creating some boundaries of educational qualification, status and financial stability, which is too tough to break, who knows nearly impossible even with extreme love and passion.The interesting part of this film perhaps starts from the point where "Shiba's" incognito boy Kundan falls in love with zoya while she was praying. Kundan's character here noticeably resembles Ranjha's character in myth. Here Kundan is the son of Hindu scholar on the other hand zoya belongs from an educated, middle-class family. But as the movie tends towards conclusion, it is not the religion that stands as obstacle rather it is the intellectual difference between them that does. But in the end they overcome those obstacles with love. So here in the end it is love that makes a triumphant journey and smiles over the cloud of dismay. First part of this movie was shot in "Banaras" which tints viewer with the color of "Holy" and love and gives viewer a flavor of teen-age immature emotion. But the story of the first part was not only limited to masochistic love. A love that bloomed in Banaras has taken political turn into Delhi which gave this movie a new dimension. In the mean time we get acquainted with rising teen-age thought and filthy power politics. Director immaculately presented some current affairs of Delhi. Here, we must give director some credit that he has depicted so many issues but the taste of this film remained unharmed. No matter how much we try to run away from politics but we have to accept this ugly truth that this very politics somehow control our lives, this very truth is finely depicted here. Another interesting part of this movie is every character here is too much stubborn. Each and every person is crazy at their point and unwilling to compromise. They are ready to leave their race, religion, city even their standards for the sake of love. In this film character of Sonam Kapoor might seem offensive for a little while but this feeling will start to diminish as the movie proceeds. In the ending part of the movie Ananda tells Kundan "There are two types of leader" , one that find peace by abolishing the government and another do find peace by establishing it." In practical life second one is very rare. But one thing has been clarified that if we need to unify all labor class people, first we need to understand their emotion rather than Marx, Angles and so on. But becoming politically influenced suddenly which occurred to Kundan in this film was not at all realistic. Dhanush played tremendously in this film, and 100% fit for this character. A tremendous bollywood debut for Dhanush , no doubt. Avay Deol though seemed little bit aged but not bad as a political leader. He has shown greater promise within a very small margin of time. Though Sonam couldn't always keep rhythm with Dhanush and delivery of her dialogue often lackluster but comparing with her other films definitely she has made progress. Bindia and Murari both characters were splendid throughout the film. Another thing is praiseworthy about this movie that it produced some brilliant dialogues which are really heart touching. Music of A.R Rahman was brilliant as usual (one wouldn't dare to judge, neither would I). Music was very relevant to the city and characters and changes according to the scenes and character. Local music of Banaras has really touched the heart. And Irshad Kamil definitely deserves some credit for his brilliant lyrics. The song "Tum Tak" in the starting of the movie clearly and finely depicts the character of Dhanush. Depiction of songs and cinematography was also very distinctive and praiseworthy. To love something or someone and destroyed by it completely (Fanaa) is the life's truer eminence, the movie pretty much ends with this concept .Review By Faiad Iftikhar Rafee Dhaka,Bangladeh . fb.me/iamrafee" 
" Love's Labour's Lost and Salvation of Kundan","9 out of 10 movies are based around a theme where a boy sees a girl and then falls for her and next aspires for her love in return. This movie claims to be no different. However, it has some kind of Paulo Coelhoisque effect, which lingers and dominates the second half of the movie and the journey of Kundan's salvation really brings the heart out of the audience. Once I was told by my teacher that tragedy is not when something wrong goes to a person; it's just his bad luck or ill fate. Tragedy happens when an ego clashes with one's love. Saying so, this movie is no tragedy. As in here we'll find the confrontation of two different sort of love; one of Kundan's and another of Zoya's. People really need to see this colourful portrayal/celebration/confrontation of love on the screen. The great aspect of the movie is the locations of Varanasi. I have never seen any other movie capturing the essence of Kashi in such a grand manner as this movie does. The screen sometimes appeared to be the portrait of Varanasi with all its colours, galiyas, ghats and so on. I guess after this the other filmmakers will also realize the potential that this city can offer them on the screen. In addition, the melodious tunes of Rehman bring the vibrant nature of Shiva's nagari with all its thumping and tablas and shanais and chanting. Audience will just fall in love with the first half of the movie. I want to see more of Dhanush, national award winner, in Hindi cinema. He has such a powerful screen presence that you will be in awe to see how he grows his character putting all different shades in it. So innocent, so so innocent. I just loved his Kundan. Sukanya Verma wrote in her review that Kundan is a gem (pun intended). I say, indeed, he is. For Sonam Kapoor, I'll say people should start taking her seriously as she has an immense potential in her yet I feel she should work more on her dialogue delivery. Her Zoya is the best she has offered yet to us, and I believe that this is just a beginning for her illustrious career. I highly recommend this movie to each and everyone who have loved and felt its pangs. If not, then go for some nice dialogues and yes for Dhanush." 
" One of the finest films i have ever seen","I don't really watch Indian movies because they are re-make (most of them) of Hollywood movies these days. But i would say it out loud that i watched Raanjhanaa and this movie is my most favorite movie so far from our neighbor country. I read a review about this movie on a website and it was one of its kind. The guy was blabbering about the unsound mind and immaturity of Dhanush in his whole review but we all loved Dhanush more than any other actor in this movie. I bet you can't expect a movie like this one in hundred more years from Bollywood..... My love for this movie can also be judged by the fact that i have written only one review so far. AR Rahman lovers will also enjoy the songs and music composition by this great music composer and singer." 
" A must watch","In a nut shell a fantastic display of performances needless to say from all present in the movie. Murari's character in particular is worth mentioning. Just mind blowing and above all the spontaneity and timing was magnificent. Dhanush, being south Indian, did justice to his role and Sonam, well she looked cute. During the 140 min run time, I felt at some point this connects to an extent, with the stories we heard, have seen and experienced. Especially the Banaras, Lucknow touch, it made me fell for the movie. I did remember the first of the firsts meeting during the Raanjhaana and yes music is awesome. Especially the title track and Tum tak... This was my first movie in a theater after the heartbreak (lol) but it turned out to be a memorable one." 
" A Beautifully Honest Love Story","I can't remember the last time I watched a Bollywood movie and couldn't find a loophole in the plot/storyline.Plot: A love-struck boy pursues a girl across the spectrum of time, only to find out that she loves someone else. His reactions and its repercussions follow.Pros: 1. A well-written script with plenty of room for your senses to take control. 2. Stellar acting by Dhanush, Abhay Deol is at his enigmatic best and even Sonam Kapoor manages to act gracefully. 3. Myriad emotions and colors from the city of Banaras to add dimensions to this movie.Cons: Still can't think of one.Verdict: Watch it and let your emotions flow. Recommended."
