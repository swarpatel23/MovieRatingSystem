" Copy of THE ROCK starring Connery, Cage and Harris","Replace Sean with Ajay, Nicholas with Ashish (Awful replacement) and Michael Biehn with Sunil Shetty. The team that infiltrates the abandoned prison (Alcatraz in THE ROCK) is CBI task force instead of the Navy Seals. Additions: Laila (An overacting Isha) Sapna (Who is it?)and The Ever crying Neha Dhupia. End result: A messy remake of the Hollywood hit with Ajay Devgan making a Vain attempt to raise the the status of the movie. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra doesn't show any consideration about the hostages and giving 'Rachit' and 'Rahul' a chance to complete the mission. Why does Neha exist? Is Isha included only for her physical beauty? The quality of the movie does not matter with of without their existence in the movie. It is also an absurd time so show a villainous Pakistan when Indo-Pak diplomatic ties are underway. Better Luck Next time Ajay" 
" Unfair!","I always used to love watching this movie as a kid, but that is not the case now. After watching this movie in 2019, I realised that I always used to blame the politicians for the conflicts between Pakistan and India, now I know that these filmmakers are equally responsible. This movie is highly biased and is targeted towards defamation of Pakistan." 
" Sucks!","Come on!! For god's sake! IF you cant think of an original idea, atleast make a decent remake!Only good(being overly generous) thing in this movie is Ajay Devgan. Rest of the cast is  idiotic. So is the action. It seems like Ajay Devgan gets a rocket up his butt whenever a bomb explodes nearby!my rating 3/10. Why three 4 for Devgan's acting + 2 for Neha Dhupia's body + 1 riya sen's exposure + 2 overall things - 6 for Sanjay Kapoor and Arbaaz khan" 
" Hollywood rip off from The Rock","Qayamat is heavilly borrowed from Hollywood Hit The Rock. Ajay Devgan plays the Sean Connery character who is heart broken and silent, it looks pathethic. Sunil Shetty is one of the Indian army who goes over the top with his unrealistic action scenes. The person that plays Nicholas Cage is unknown actor Aashish Choudhury, in a very weak performance. The positive side of this film has to be the Sexy Actresses. Introducing the Very Sexy Neha Duphia looking delicious. There is also the very sexy Riya Sen looking Hot as ever. Qayamat has entertaining villains, the chemistry between Arbaaz Khan, Sanjay Kapoor and Isha Kopikar is Enjoyable. The movie does have some fun moment. The Songs are quite enjoying. Overall this movie is a good time pass. Thanks a lot for the Girls of the film." 
" Excellent!","This movie is awesome!  With a movie boasting of a big, talented cast, every character is excellently developed.  The idea of threatening Mumbai with biological weapons is very interesting and scary.  The Sanjay-Isha-Arbaaz terrorist trio is also a completely new and unheard of concept.  There is a good portion of romance but placed such that it does not blur away the action/suspense.  Songs are fabulous, especially the "Qayamat" track. Although the jail seems to be inspired heavily from Alcatraz, this is a sleek, intelligent film." 
" Copy of THE ROCK","Harry Baweja after the success of DILWALE(1994), DILJALE(1996) with Ajay Devgan and the flops like DEEWANE(2000) and KARZ(2002) returns with QAYAMATThe film got lot of hype because it was the first digitally corrected film, it had an international look to it and also the stunts were stylised unlike films those days The film is a remake of THE ROCK(1996) and very indianisedThe film had a huge cast from Ajay Devgan, Sunil Shetty to Sanjay Kapoor/Arbaaz and also Ashish Chaudhary The film starts off well but stagnates once Ajay's character is introduced with songs after songs which pour in making one lose interest Also the number of clich√©s which weren't there in THE ROCK(1996) Plus the dialogues are too Anti Pakistani which give the film a dated feel The film however does catch your attention after the kidnap of the innocent people and followed by the threats and till the end the film manages to keep you involved. But there are several flaws like how Neha Dhupia survives is not clear? Also the film gets too filmy at several points and the climax has overdose of stuntsDirection is decent, though not at his best Music by Nadeem Shravan is good but too many songs spoil the show Camera-work is superb Stunts(Allan Amin) has too many overdone slow motion MATRIX inspired ones which get repetitive but make for a good viewing, somehow Bollywood got stuck with this type stunts for a long time and it got boringAjay Devgan excels in his role wherein he has to convey through eyes, expressions and bereft of dialogues for half the film he leaves the maximum effect with his brilliant performance Sunil Shetty plays the stereotypical cop after DILWALE and he also has a love track with Raveena Tandon(sp app) which was cut out first after release and then re inserted, he also has some Anti Pak dialogues to mouth and does a decent job Sanjay Kapoor does a good job in a negative role though at times could be toned down, He is a better villain then hero Arbaaz Khan is alright though at times their characters irritate Chunky Pandey overdoes it Ashish Chaudhary irritates as usual Amongst actresses Neha Dhupia in her first movie and a dubbed voice is strictly okay Isha is better while Riya Sen annoys Raveena makes a guest appearance Anjan Shrivastav, Govind Namdeo are typecast" 
" Strictly OK.","This movie promised a lot at the beginning but faltered after Ajay Devgan's introduction. One of the main reasons is the unnecessary songs that just disrupt the flow of the movie. I see this happening with many Bollywood movies and it's just plain annoying. Nevertheless, since Qayamat is digitally rendered, it looks very good on the big screen. The story is lifted off The Rock(1996), but fails to grip the viewer as much as The Rock did. The Rock was not only entertaining, but also full of tension. Qayamat did not provide any of that to me. The acting was just about OK, with the sole exception of Ajay Devgan. This movie was a hit, so a lot of credit should be given to Devgan. He hits all the right points at the right time and provides exactly the kind of crowd-pleasing-ass-kickin'-tour-de-force that is needed to carry a movie like this. Suniel Shetty does a commendable job, but the rest of the cast have nothing to be proud of. I thought the trio of Arbaaz-Sanjay-Isha just got annoying toward the later stages. If there was one thing this movie could be proud of, it's Allan Amin's action sequences. Though ripped off many Hollywood action movies, the action is great and the time and effort put into those sequences has really paid off. Overall, this movie can be watched once, but not more. 6/10." 
" Good movie ... only one problem","This is an excellent movie for anyone who watches a lot of Indian movies, but not a lot of Hollywood movies. Thats because its a rip-off of 'The Rock'. I would have enjoyed it more if I had not watched 'The Rock'. There were some unnecessary special effects in this movie that were annoying sometimes. I would give it a 2 out of 5." 
" Bollywood Popcorn Flick","I watched this movie the other day as i had keenly anticipated the release of it. As ever in true bollywood style the story is a blatently been lifted from the hollywood blockbuster The Rock. The film is very entertaining throughout keeping u at the edge of your seatz most of the way through. There are a number of faultz in this movie...mainly the lacklustre acting from most of the cast & the highly annoying script, also dere are to many songs in Qayamat, mainly in the first half which only slowz down the pace of this action flick. There are two factorz that save dis movie from being a complete stinker...AJAY DEVGAN & THE ACTION SCENEZ. The action scenez in Qayamat are probably the best ever in bollywood, they leave u in complete awe as u can see a lot of time & money has been spent 2 make the scenez look accomplished Ajay Devgan totally stealz the show with his superb acting in a role which was tailor made 4 him, even though he hardly speakz throughout the whole of the movie his emotionz are shown through his brilliant pragmatics, this role definetly is up there wid his brilliant rolez in COMPANY, DEEWANEGEE & LEGEND OF BHAGAT SINGH...trully mezmerizing. Overall this movie is pure eye candy...if u want a entertaining nite out then go watch QAYAMAT I give it 7/10"

Good Matrix Style Action Thriller With Good Songs Thrills Special Effects and Different sets like an Underground Tunnel,a jail and a Scientific Laboratory!, But The Genuine Soul Of The Movie is The Excellent Performance By The Highly Talented Handsome Supremo Ashish Chowdhry, Ashish is The Best & is Cut Above The Rest !"
