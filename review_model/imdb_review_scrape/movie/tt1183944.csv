" See Sadiyaan for Hema Malini, Rekha, and Rishi Kapoor...","If "Sadiyaan"'s only attraction was new faces Luv Sinha and Ferena Wazeir, it wouldn't lure many film-goers into the cinema. But, a triumvirate of talents make it a worthwhile enterprise: Hema Malini, Rekha, and Rishi Kapoor. Fortunately, enough screen time is given to these veterans, who persuade one to overlook the newcomers' tepid performances.The film begins in tumultuous times: it is 1947, and Amritsar is the roiling scene of sectarian violence. As India is rent asunder into two countries, corpse-laden trains ply between Amritsar and Lahore, as Hindus and Muslims slaughter each other in horrific numbers. Sikh Rajveer Singh and his wife Amrit (Rishi Kapoor and Rekha) flee their Lahore home in what overnight has become Muslim Pakistan and take refuge in the abandoned Amritsar haveli of a Muslim family that has, likewise, taken flight from Hindu India. They discover a toddler in the debris of the mansion, and try to look for his family. When they realize all the Muslims in the area have died or gone across the border, they raise the child with all love and tenderness. Their own son had been killed, and they rejoice at this second chance at parenthood.The first time Rekha appears on screen, her eyes are shut, and her luxuriant false eyelashes make one think twin moths have alighted on that gorgeous face. My heart sank, because over the years, Rekha has taken to gilding the lily. She possesses an enviable amount of talent, but her screen makeup and wardrobe have become more and more rococo. One wishes she would simply wipe off the excess makeup, dispense with unnecessary baubles, and let the sheer incandescence of her talent and her substantial natural beauty shine through. God knows she has enough of both. But that was just a momentary stumble, for once the story and the actress get going, there isn't a chance to notice things like false eyelashes and the overly fussy tendrils framing those legendary features.Rekha's Amrit is a paragon of maternal love. But her mother act refrains from becoming cloying. When her adoptive son falls in love with a Muslim girl, and her family refuses to accept a non-Muslim son-in-law, Amrit decides to come clean. Placing her son's happiness above her maternal instincts, she reveals that not only is he NOT her son, the boy is Muslim, as well. When the prospective in-laws accuse her of concocting a story for their acquiescence, her husband and she set about looking for any living relatives of their son in Pakistan.For years, both sides had thought it impossible for anyone to have survived the bloodbath of the Partition, but miraculously, Amrit and Rajveer's search turns up the boy's parents (Hema Malini and Javed Sheikh), patricians who number among Lahore's elite. The girl's family cannot believe their luck, and immediately agree to the match. When the birth parents show up for the wedding and announce that they will take their son and his bride with them to Pakistan, Amrit and Rajveer are tested anew. Director Raj Kanwar recognizes his young leads couldn't possibly shoulder the film, and gives the stalwarts plenty of time and screen space to take the story forward, and they don't disappoint.The film belongs to Rekha, with Rishi Kapoor gallantly abetting his two leading ladies. Hema Malini gets less screen time, but dazzles as the elegant, aristocratic Benazir who is reunited with the son she'd feared dead. Shatrughan Sinha, new actor Luv Sinha's father, was never known for his looks. Against popular wisdom, he sought a career in film, graduating from the Film and Television Institute of India. At a time when Hindi film heroes were fair and handsome, his dark unconventional looks and chutzpah set him apart. His dialogue delivery and flamboyance made him the go-to villain, and later on, a surprisingly successful leading man. While I wish Luv Sinha the best in his chosen profession, I would be remiss not to point out that he lacks the looks or—and more's the pity—the talent to make one take notice of him. His Ishaan is callow in the extreme, and his puny physique and unimpressive dialogue delivery don't help. Had he been paired with a beautiful, capable actress, his shortcomings would have been glaringly obvious. Luckily his co-star, like him, is neither good-looking nor talented. Rekha is a wonder to behold, and I wish her screen outings were more frequent. When there is a good story and a good role, she goes at both with a gusto that is awesome to watch. She looks terrific, too, and over the years of 1947 to 1961 doesn't age by even a single day. I loved her simple but artsy wardrobe, and her great grace and dignity in the face of a tremendous sacrifice. Rishi Kapoor has gone from cherubic leading man to excellent character actor. In fact this transition has let the actor inside emerge. His turns in "Luck By Chance" and "Fanaa" were a treat to watch. Here, despite not having as showy a role as Rekha, he effectively conveys the anxiety and pain of a parent who might lose his only child. He chivalrously allows some grey to peek through in his beard over the time span of the film, while screen wife Rekha remains impervious to the passage of the years. Hema Malini at sixty-two is possibly more beautiful now than she ever was as the Dreamgirl of Hindi cinema. Her Benazir is dignified yet passionate, and oh-so-elegant in her Pakistani shalwaar-kameez and pearls. They truly don't make them like Hema Malini and Rekha anymore: one leaves the cinema with that thought and the fervent wish these ladies get the opportunity to show their mettle in more films. Come on, filmmakers, that's not too much to ask for, is it?" 
" Waste of time and money","Watched this horrible movie last Friday. I went to see this in anticipation of some new story and acting of new comer Luv Sinha. All I can say that , one will get more entertainment by watching TV than spending 'sadiyaan' in movie theater to wait for end.Luv Sinha looks and acts like a road side tea seller. God knows , from where he got the idea of acting in movies.Music is OK but could be better.Director did a wise thing by taking Hema, Rekha and Rishi Kapoor in the movie. At last, you can find some solace to see these seasoned actors on screen." 
" Rekha, Hema, light up the screen in 'Sadiyaan'","Finally something that actually looks BOLLYWOOD!! Rekha, Rishi Kapoor and Hema Malini, delight to watch the legendary actors giving their best as always...Veteran actor Shatrughan Sinha's son Luv Sinha fits his role as a MA Kan lad la. However he is unprepared as an actor and comes across wooden. He does a little better in the intense scenes later in the film.Unlike her co-star Luv, Ferena shows a natural flair for comedy and drama, be it the scenes where she is pretending to be a blind girl,meeting his mother Rekha for the first time or begging him to run away with her. She is a very natural performer. A little grooming and attention to her make-up and wardrobe and she will go very far.Music could have been better..Raj Kanwar who in the past has made some very successful melodramas,induces great dignity into the tussle between the modern day Devaki and Yashodhara." 
" It has all seen before content and scenes.","If a veteran of Shatrughan Sinha's status known for his witty intelligent remarks and good sense of humor approves this kind of below average movie for the launch of his own son Luv Sinha, then it seriously raises many questions to be asked from the still active actor turned politician. And further if the project is supported by the famous exponents of the art such as Hema Malini, Rekha and Rishi Kapoor, then it clearly indicates that Bollywood is still walking on a dualistic path, where both modern and old thought cinema is being made at the same time for the changing viewers.Sadiyaan is a perfect example of the fact since it has been strictly made with the decades old mind-set of amalgamating emotional drama with a love story. Set in the 70s of the last century, the movie tells the same ages old story of two mothers of a boy, where one is Muslim and the actual mother who has given birth to the child and the other is Hindu (or confusingly Sikh), who has raised him with her selfless love and affection. Along with that the writers add the element of Indian Partition of 1947 to give it a more original and historical feel. But sadly nothing really works in this uninteresting project apart from the few scenes towards its end where both Hema and Rekha share the screen presence together. Right from the start, the movie fails to generate any kind of curiosity or impact among the viewers. Commencing with a voice over speaking about Punjab, its history of martyrdom and the importance of the state in Indian Independence, Sadiyaan makes you remember several similar projects you have witnessed in the past revolving around the partition. In the first half, it has all seen before story and content of a lost and found child, a family of different religion looking after him, his introduction as a young boy, romance with a Kashmiri girl in the beautiful valleys of Kashmir, the girl posing as a blind girl at first, their early fights leading to the eternal love, more songs and then the good old family drama in the end.In fact it's only in the second half that the movie holds some ground when both Hema Malini and Javed Sheikh enter as the real parents of the boy coming all over from Pakistan. But till then most of the viewers in the theater have already gone out for their more importance engagements. The writing is the weakest part of the flick, where the characters keep on moving around a completely predictable formula without anything exciting in store to offer. The director even makes them speak a mixed lingo with words from both Hindi and Punjabi language in a single sentence which sounds very absurd at times. The most amazing and questionable sequence comes towards the end, when everyone in the Muslim family of the girl, who were even ready to call for communal riots against the inter-caste marriage, suddenly undergo a heart transformation with only a few lines spoken by Hema and Javed. All the hatred and confusions get solved within seconds in the end in only one scene, as if the director was in a great hurry to finish it all.Nevertheless Rishi Kapoor, Rekha and Hema Malini, shine in their respective acts and prove their individual worth once again. It's sheer delight to watch both Rekha and Hema Malini posing as the two mothers together on the screen. But even then the director is not able to exploit the presence of all these veterans together in a project to the best of their abilities. The debutant Luv Sinha still has to go a long way and should concentrate more towards sharpening his acting skills. He picks up fast and manages to give an OK performance. Feren is also just fine as Luv's girl but can surely do much better. Javed Sheikh is perfectly cast as the Pakistani father of the child. Deep Dhillon and Vivek Shauq both have repeated their routine acts. Musically, Adnan Sami wastes another opportunity to make a mark as the music director in Bollywood. Cinematography and Art direction are also not able to create any touching impact about the horrifying days of partition.In the end, I can only say that director Raj Kanwar, who has been associated with good emotional dramas and many newcomers in the past, is not able to help any of the youngsters featuring in his movie this time. So Luv Sinha will have to start afresh with another project in the future and next time he should choose his script and subject with an extra care."
