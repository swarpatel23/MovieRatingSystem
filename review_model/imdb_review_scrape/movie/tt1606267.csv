" It doesn't seem like a movie from the director of PARINEETA.","Pradeep Sarkar,surprised and impressed many veterans of the industry with his subtle sensibilities in "Parineeta". And after his debacle of "Laaga Chunri Mein Daag", he had to do something out of the routine to prove his mastery over the medium once again.But after watching his latest movie, I was quite shocked and confused since it turned out to be a completely unexpectedly below average show from the talented director.In simple words, LP proves to be the weakest film of its entire star- cast and the director, except KK and Piyush Mishra. The way a good concept has been executed on the screen is not able to convince. The script is highly predictable wherein everything keeps on happening so easily without any hassle or difficulty. And the most surprising factor is that LP lacks the real emotional depth which was in fact the forte of its director Pradeep Sarkar.In support of my big disappointment from the movie, here are some points I would like to mention:1. The whole film moves at the same lazy pace with no acceleration of any kind, despite of the fact that its climax is written around a famous Reality Show Finale.2. Deepika loses her eyesight due to an accident and this serious issue of getting blind doesn't even get a single emotional scene where the truth is revealed to her. Deepika shows no repulsion from her side to her blindness and just starts practicing her skating again. It was indeed very shocking to see a serious issue of losing the eyes taken so lightly by the script writer and the director.3. The moment Deepika accepts her disability and decides to fight back, the viewer can easily predict the complete movie till the end. 4. All the sequences wherein Deepika is being taught to learn the art of looking without her eyes are too easy to believe and digest. Besides this she also learns the tricks so fast, in just few days without any severe training given by some specialized master.5. The reference to an ongoing reality show "India's Got Talent" remains the most ineffective part of the movie, in absence of any excitement or interesting nail biting moments. Further, the finale of the show featuring 3 guest judges,Shamaik, Juhi and Javed Jaffery is shot in such a childish way where the judges don't even get a single line to say and the couple is just assumed to be the winners. Moreover their trophy is also delivered to them by their friends in a different scene later on.6. The computer graphics used in the accident and sound training sequence around the bells surely could have been much better in this big budget movie.7. The movie finishes off on a very low note and leaves no impact of any kind on the viewer. Neither the audience feel emotionally connected to the characters nor they feel extremely happy for the couple on their grand win.8. Lastly the film was highly publicized in the media as a thriller with some dare devil stunts performed by Neil and other bikers. But the stunts are hardly there and it cannot be called a thriller from any angle. Also along with its strange title, several other elements in the script like the boxing fight sequences, the underworld angle in the storyline and the characterization of Neil-Deepika's close friends remain tasteless as some half baked pieces of the cake.Apart from these, the other two departments in which LAGANGE PARINDEY fails to impress are its performances and music. Choosing Neil as a Tapori was the biggest mistake of the casting team. Though he tries hard to look and speak like his character, but his overall personality doesn't permit you to believe that he is a tapori. Many of the readers, familiar with the Golden Years of Hindi Films would readily agree that using Neil as a tapori boy was just like using Pradeep Kumar in a role of a beggar. (The famous actor had the killer looks of a rich, millionaire person and nobody could ever imagine him in the role of a poor man.)Deepika also tries her best to put up a good show but her over confidence clearly shows on the face which turns her otherwise OK performance into an average one. A blind girl portrayed by Deepika never gives you any signs of grief, discontentment and pain which seem to be quite superficial. Besides this, even after losing the eyesight, her fashion sense, her make-up and her body hugging outfits questionably remain intact, which the director tries to justify by giving her a close female friend. The investigating officer & all the actors in the friend circle are good but they sadly don't get any meatier scenes to make their presence felt. So, it all comes to only KK and Piyush Mishra. But unfortunately KK is there for only 3-4 minutes and Piyush Mishra keeps coming after long painful gaps.Musically the soundtrack is not as per the standards of a Pradeep Sarkar movie. I wonder why he didn't repeat his earlier music director Shantanu Moitra who did a nice job in both his precious movies. Talking about the main story plot of the film, many viewers may find it similar to Rajesh hanna's "Dushmun",Gulzar's "Kinara" and more recently Anubahv Sinha's "Tum Bin".In nutshell, the movie was indeed an unexpected letdown for me as I couldn't find Pradeep Sarkar anywhere in the film till the end. So, you can watch it if you are a fan of Neil or Deepika, but don't go for it expecting a high paced thriller from the director of "Parineeta"." 
" Highly entertaining film about life and love with gangsterism in the backdrop. Full of surprises.","This film truly surprised me. I was expecting one of the same old formula gangster cum romance film; but, surprise, it takes pot shots at life! It is definitely one of the most entertaining films of the year. Gopi Puthran the story/screenplay/dialogs writer is truly a great find and we will certainly hear more about him.In the acting department, the entire cast surprises you by giving very competent performances. I really loved the Bhai, KK Menon makes a good guest appearance. Both Deepika and Neil surprised me with their performance! All the other goofy named characters were also good.The story is extremely well written and the film is well directed. The dialogs are memorable and strong! Mumbaiya and tapori (rowdy) language rules! This film reminds you of the good old day films where story and entertainment was paramount. Basically, that formula has been worked out for today's audience.The songs and music are quite good. The photography too is quite good.What is outstanding is the skating choreography (Sandro Guerro)! Deepika and Neil really shine in the skating scenes!The end is a little bit abrupt and predictable!Will I watch it again? Yes, of course. There is a bit of violence and gangsterism is the backdrop, but this film is about life and love. Definitely worth a watch, if not more. Go for it! Finally, a truly entertaining film." 
" Very Good Movie",""Lafangey Parindey" is a delight to watch. No because of its two bold and beautiful lead, but because it tells a very good story of faith,survival,struggle and love in a very simple and elegant manner.Cast wise,I can't expect more.Special mention for Deepika Padukone.This gorgeous gal is just perfect for the role of Pinky Palkar,a blind girl with big dreams,but demoralized by the unfortunate turn of events in her life. Neil Nitin Mukesh plays One Shot Nandu and does it good. Maybe his stylish clothes, neat and clean accent and fairer than fair complexion makes us question his selection for a Street Fighter role,but One Shot Nandu's inner conflict with his biggest regrets and fight to achieve redemption is beautifully portrayed by Neil. And Piyush Mishra is exceptional as always.What separates "Lafangey Parindey" from rest is the narrative raw material has been primed to yield loads of drama, some dirty dancing and a bit of daredevilry.Pradeep Sarkar pans his camera on these gritty streets and gullies of Mumbai and tells a simple tale of two free-spirited youngsters who believe nothing is impossible.He does not get preachy or patronizing in his storytelling in spite of his story being predictable.High on emotions, the film is more of a drama but comedy and romance too have their prominence in the script.Overall,"Lafangey Parindey" is a human tale of risk and loss, and emotional victories. It is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of Mumbai. Watch it for its earnest performances, real characters and sheer simplicity.My Verdict: 8/10" 
" Bracingly Inept and Uninteresting","You can surely tell 'Lafangey Parindey' has been passed through Sanjib Datta's editing bay one too many times. Style over substance is the norm as the whole film looks like what someone might vomit up after partially digesting Natarajan Subramanian's digitized footage. Eldridge Rodrigues' insistently fussy and grandiose production design mistakes extra-crisp textures, brilliant colors and high contrast backdrops for story atmosphere and style. Yes it's flashy as hell, but amphetamine-fueled methods do not compensate for distinct lack of substance. Sham Kaushal's action all but forces its bulky, twitching mass down your throat until you realize you haven't been entertained but assaulted.'Lafangey Parindey' is certainly a front runner for one of the worst mainstream Bollywood releases of the year. It will try your patience and give you a throbbing headache - about all it does with any success." 
" Predictable but a good Time pass!","What do you expect from a love story now-a-days? Should it be different? Should it be unique? Should it be one of a kind? But how many times have you come across a love story that is different or unique? You'd say none! I wouldn't disagree. But, Lafangey Parindey somehow doesn't go down as common love story. Okay, it's not different but it is not a million times seen love story..She, a wannabe figure skater, cannot see. He, a bare-knuckles street- fighter, doesn't need to. But both Pinky Palkar(Deepika Padukone) and Nandan Kamtekar(Neil Nitin Mukesh) have their sights firmly set on a better life, a life beyond the mean backstreets of Mumbai. One Shot Nandu, as he is called, fights blindfolded every week for Satta King(Piyush Mishra) and lays his opponent low with one blow, always wins. Pinky, dreams of making it big by winning a reality show but an accident takes away her eye sight and then she is supported by Nandu to refocus her goal. Dekhne ko aankh nai keeda maangta hai. This is the lesson he gives to Pinky. She starts using her all sense organs to offset the absence of sight. Together they form an unlikely pair, but as fate had decided they fell in love and with predictable twists and turns they finally achieve their goals.The movie is a predictable ride from the beginning, but the typical Mumbai lingo along with fine performances of specially supporting actors prevent you from looking at your watch and the ceiling. The first half is slow and little boring but the skate dancing in the second half is the saving grace. Many scenes do bring smiles and laughs during the movie.Neil Nitin is evolving. He has done extremely well. Deepika is finally learning to act. This is her finest performance to date. Piyush Mishra is exceptional. As stated earlier, the supporting actors have done a brilliant job. Music by R. Anandh is good. Special note for the song Man Lafanga sung by Mohit Chauhan. Choreography is top notch. Bosco-Caeser are sure to get many accolades for the skate dancing in the climax of the movie. Dialogues by Gopi Puthran are hilarious. Action and cinematography are OK. Pradeep Sarkar of Parineeta and Laga Chunari Me Daag fame surely has attempted a very different genre this time. He doesn't succeed, nor he fails. The movie is perfect mixture of entertainment and boredom. Seldom you get bored and often you laugh.To conclude, I would say go for it, if you are looking for a complete masala Bollywood flick and some brilliant skate dancing. My Rating: 6/10Thanks & Regards" 
" Neil Neil Neil","I was really quite hesitant to watch this movie at first.I mean ,it had bikes and gangsters and there was a girl.It was such a cliché at first glance,but since I believe that Neil Nitein Mukesh has always managed to amaze me in each and every film,I decided to go against my guts. And as usual I was blown away by Neil's performance.Yes,the storyline was undeniably predictable all the way but it wasn't that much of a cliché.There was still some very good scenes,like for example when Munna dunked Pinky into the water.Did I mention how good Neil is,he is.I think he's one of the most underrated actor in BOllywood.I really wasn't quite surprised to find that he pulled of his character with conviction.Deepika as the blind heroine also should be given a mention,To me, Deepika was always a pretty girl but she held her own beside the oh so amazing Neil Nitein Mukesh.Her stubborn blind girl act is definitely way better than the bimbo head she played in Houseful. I enjoyed the songs especially Man Lafanga and the stunts were good,since I'm no stunt buff(whatever you call it)and I don't think I should mention to much of it,but overall the movie is definitely a good watch." 
" Great love story without the mushy stuff","Aditya Chopra pulls off another great love story, but this one is a bit different than his usual. Though the story line is somewhat predictable, it is still entertaining watching Pinky achieve her dreams despite the odds and Nandu change his whole attitude towards life. The supporting cast all play their roles well. The film achieves a form of grittiness through excellent use of cool colors, gritty music and scenery. But even through that, the underlying love story is not lost. The soundtrack is excellent with weird bits of Celtic, gypsy and classical all thrown in and used at the most appropriate times. This story will have you bobbing around happy at the appropriate times and sad the next when things don't always go as expected. You will enjoy the triumph of the human spirit in this movie. Good for guys as well as gals" 
" Poor copy of Ice Castles","A very poor adaptation of 1978 English movie "Ice Castles". The protagonist in the English movie is an ice skater while Deepika's character here is a roller skater. They both turn blind due to an accident. While in the English movie the blindness is due to her fault, the Bollywood version tends to add a cinematic touch with the person responsible being her would be boyfriend, Nitin character. The story is very predictable. The characters don't stand up. Neither are the songs good. Acting skills of Nitin and Deepika are miserable.What could have been a challenging role for the key characters turns out to be stereotypical oft-repeated Bollywood mantra." 
" Amending two things could have made a difference","The movie is good, something you could watch it with the entire family and get complete dose of entertainment. Sadly the title plays the spoilt-sport (wonder why the production house did not raise an objection). Niel's character has various shades to it and he attempts hard to bring out the guilt and redemption to the best of his abilities. He is good in his own right as an actor (ref. Johnny Gaddar) but here we wanted Shahid Kapoor who can elevate the character to a different level. Deepika gives her best shot to the character. Had the movie worked it would have done what "Black" did for Rani. However the portrayal of her disability lacks screen time owing to which it the character fails to evoke compassion from the audience. Deepika's performance covers up the short-coming of her male counterpart. And the friends provide good relief moments with their authentic one-liners and goofs. More screen time was warranted from Kay Kay. Piyush Mishra has a strong screen presence. Kishor Ballal's role I guess got chopped on the editing table. Songs hardly make any impact. The cinematography is good. Fight sequences are well shot and so are the skating sequences. Not a bad watch when aired on telly, but certainly not a product you would expect from Yash Raj & Parineeta director." 
" Predictable","Lafangey Parindey,directed by Pradeep Sarkar is boring.The storyline is predictable.Even otherwise the movie has nothing new to offer.The climax is good.Pradeep Sarkar is a letdown.The music is good.Performance wise-Neil Nitin Mukesh is good.Deepika Padukone is very good.Piyush Mishra is first rate.Manish Chaudhary is good.Kay Kay Menon appears in a special appearance.Overall Lafangey Parindey,is a letdown." 
" Album: Lafangey Parindey","The album 'Lafangey Pariendey' has seven songs written by Swanand Kirkire and composed by R.Anandh, the famous ad jingle composer.The album opens with the song 'Lafangey Parindey' by Ronit Sarkar. The songs starts with an Arabian music and then the fast beat starts. It plays its role right as the title song. Then comes 'Man Lafanga' by Mohit Chouhan which has a soft track and is easy on ears. Mohit does his job very well. Next comes 'Dhatad Tatad' by Shail Hada and Anushka Manchanda. It is a dance music and the audience can not but stop tapping their foot with this cheerful song. After that there is a soft song 'Nain Parindey' by Shilpa Rao. Audience will feel calm hearing this song and probably it is the best song in the album. Shilpa's voice seems to have turned magical in this song. Then 'Rang Daalein' comes next by Suuraj Jagan. It is another song with hard music and the song is very youthful. Suraj does his job quite well. After that comes 'Born to fly' which is an instrumental and it is ideal for ballad dance. It has two parts. The first part has a slow, dreamy beat and the second part is a mixture of the beats of the other hard music of this album. The last song of the album is the club mix of 'Man lafanga' by Joshiley . It's first beat pleases the audience. The album will surely pass with the letter marks from the audience." 
" U decide.","Sometimes, your reputation precedes you. Pradeep Sarkar carries the reputation of making women-centric movies. Films like PARINEETA and LAAGA CHUNARI MEIN DAAG prove it. Who would've ever thought Sarkar would do a 360 degree turn in his third film by calling it LAFANGEY PARINDEY, set it in a ch awl and make his characters speak groundless lingo? Hard to digest, isn't it? Frankly, the skilled storyteller takes you on a trip least expected from him.When you attempt something you haven't attempted earlier or ventured into before, you either fall flat on your face or walk with your chin up in air. Sarkar doesn't slip, although LAFANGEY PARINDEY does have its share of hiccups that show up intermittently. Unlike PARINEETA and LAAGA CHUNARI MEIN DAAG, Sarkar narrates a simple story this time around and though it has nothing to do with the Rajesh Khanna – Mumtaz – Meena Kumari starer DUSHMUN, you can't help but draw parallels with it, which, frankly, could be a coincidence as well. Yet, to be fair to Sarkar, he ventures in an unknown territory like a seasoned player On the flip side, the film has a major flaw and that dilutes the impact to an extent: Casting Neil Nitin Mukesh as a bogus. He just doesn't look like one. Even if he tries very hard to get into the skin of the character, you just can't connect with him since the suave and dashing demeanor makes him look like a Harvard returned, not someone from the streets or wadis of Mumbai definitely.Final word? Sure, it has its share of shortcomings, but is an engaging watch nonetheless.LAFANGEY PARINDEY is about a group of youngsters living in the back streets of Mumbai. It is the love story of Nandu and Pinky .One-Shot Nandu takes boxing to a new level by knocking down his opponents – blindfolded. Needless to say, One-Shot lives life on his own terms and is a local hero amongst his friends. But all that changes when he meets Pinky.Pinky works at a mall, but is a kick ass dancer on skates. Strong-headed, talented and fiercely ambitious, she aspires to rise above all the 'losers' living in her locality and carve a niche for herself. Two different personalities. Two different lives. Destined to meet.LAFANGEY PARINDEY starts with gusto! Also, it moves on a singular path, without diversifying into unwanted sub-plots and superfluous characters. In fact, the story takes off at the commencement of the film itself and how Neil and Deepika's lives get intertwined makes for interesting viewing.The film has some truly engaging moments and most of them are in its first hour. Sequences between Neil and Deepika after the accident are wonderful and keep you hooked. However, things begin to slacken in the post-interval portions, when the love story takes over and Neil and Deepika realize that they share a deeper bond. Just when things are about to go downhill, the climax happens and LAFANGEY PARINDEY is back on track. In fact, the drama in the finale – when Deepika and Neil have to perform the final act for a television show – is the highpoint of this film. The skating sequences and choreography are stunning and awe-inspiring. Blemishes? Oh yes! The love story is conventional and dreary. Also, the investigating officer's track is half-baked and looks like an add-on. Besides, the film is embellished with a mediocre musical score . Also, the Bambaiya Hindi has its limitations.Like I pointed out earlier, Neil is the wrong choice for this part. Also, he lacks the fire to carry off the role with flourish. LAFANGEY PARINDEY clearly belongs to Deepika Padukone, who suits the character and enacts it with such competence that it leaves you amazed. The pretty lass is only getting better with every film. Piyush Mishra is first-rate. Kay Kay Menon is okay in a brief role. The friends, each them, leave a mark. Especially Namit Das, who's wonderful. Shiamak Davar, Juhi Chawla and Javed Jafferi feature in brief roles.On the whole, LAFANGEY PARINDEY may be predictable, but is engaging and entertaining nonetheless. A decent watch!" 
" stupid movie","This movie looks like its been made for the front benchers ,so we decided to watch it from the front bench ........okay I am lying .......there was no advance booking done today ,so we had to take the only available seats .Both Neil Nitin Mukesh and Deepika Padukone are lower middle class Maharashtrians living in a chawl in Tilakwadi in Mumbai .Difference--While Neil is a Lafangaa ( what else ? ) working for the local goon Usmanbhai , and other boys in the neighbourhood including Deepika's brother waste their time horsing about in the gullies ,Deepika dreams about getting out of the rut of lower class existence and making it big as a skate-dancer...............until her dreams are shattered by an accident and she turns to Neil to restore them ........not knowing that he harbours a deadly secret......Deepika certainly plays the role of a tough-talking street smart girl well , daring to claim that she is the one who makes passes on her dance trainer because he doesn't...........and looks as good as she has in her every film......and dances great too.........Sadly , the rest of the film doesn't match her...........its rather mediocre......The Mumbai street language of the chawls has been a bit overdone .......Neils acting is just about okay......music is not worth talking about........ending is insipid......."
