" Bollywood version of Saving Silverman from Hollywood.","Yet another copy of a Hollywood movie made into bollywood. Few changes here and there but the main plot/climax/characters were copied from Saving Silverman, although not even close to how funny Steve Zahn, Jack Black, Jason Biggs, and Amanda Peet were. No wonder this movie was suppose to release in 2005 but didn't come out until 2009. A lot of things were missing, Arshad Warsi did pretty well, but playing Jack Black's part is not even gonna be on his level. Just another typical bolly movie leaving u with a very minimal laughter. I wouldn't say it was terrible, but it was a mediocre performance. If u like Hollywood movies, then skip this and watch Saving Silverman instead, trust me you will be peeing ur self from laughter." 
" Have u seen De Taali???","I Haven't seen Saving Silverman Yet. But i have seen De Tali. And i would say this is a copy of De Tali.Simple Story, 3 friends swearing for one for all and for all! When the love of one goes away the other two tries to get someone to save their friend.But the new girl they find is con. So now it is their responsibility to save this friend from this girl.Some twist & turns and then a happy Ending.Acting of Arshad Warsi is good in his role and others are OK. Not even a time pass movie.I would suggest to watch De Tali instead of it as there are some hilarious moments where u can laugh some times.So guys don't waste your time here. Go some other place if u really want some good time." 
" Bakwas!","WTF? This movie is an utter waste of time, not one thing about it is entertaining at all. They had to guts to say that LOC had no story? And worse yet spoof Devdas, Chameli and Julie? I am shocked that talented people like Arshad Warsi and Udita Goswami were in on this. Let's not even talk about the lazy choreography (I can't believe Ganesh Acharya had anything to do with it) and the lackluster songs. Ugh!For a 2009 movie, every copy should be rounded up and burnt to ashes and even the ashes should be re-burnt just in case some idiot gets an idea 10 or 20 years from now to try and do a remake."
