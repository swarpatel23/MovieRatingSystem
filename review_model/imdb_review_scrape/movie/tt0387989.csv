" Warmongering's old hat at best, dangerous & irresponsible at worst","Come on! Get over with the Pakistan bashing guys. Bollywood can not only make brilliant movies- but can seriously affect a generation of viewers.I am a HUGE Bollywood fan- but anti-Pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay, cinematography, action sequences- everything.I'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda, and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its Bollywood masala- but also because it tries to say: give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses." 
" Good subject","Two movies back to back which dealt with Indian POWs; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone, Deewaar focuses on the main subject itself. It is not hidden that many Indian POWs are rotting in Pakistani Jails for years - for whom neither Indian Govt. has time or sympathy nor the other side. I'm sure some of Pakistani POWs are in India as well, but let's focus on the movie. Full of actors. Some were stage actors like Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan who plays the role of a Major, acted well. Akshaye Khanna did his part well. There was nothing for Amrita Rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs. I think Sanjay Dutt's role was most solid even though it wasn't too long. He acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive. If you compare it to LOC, which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions (if it HAD a story) - Deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors. 7.5/10" 
" Deewar:: Lets chase the audience home!","Amitabh should sincerely think twice about the credentials of the director and most importantly the script before giving the nod. And the same I would say for Sanjay Dutt and Akshaye Khanna. I mean how is that everyone just overlooked the basic fabric of the movie-making.Agreed that it the premise of POW has never been attempted before on Indian screen, but that doesn't give you the freedom to take cinematic liberties to such great extent. Yes the movie is mash of so many English POW Escape movies. But if that was the case, why didn't the makers decide to choose one classic English POW and make a complete re-make of it. Pakistani bashing - Oh my God!!!! Its so clumsy and cheesy that makes you wonder why it has been forced in such a gawdy manner. Guys - you need to watch Gadar and thats what I call classy Pakistani bashing.Romantic track - when do Bollywood film-makers ever learn to do away with conventional movie-making!!! Akshaye-Amrita track is so very cliché'd and aptly justifies the word "force-fit".Marhaba-Marhaba song - my personal opinion the latest Remix albums are much better. Milan Lutharia no but Sridhar Raghavan Yes, I was expecting a lot from him. But as a writer he was a big downer. The script doesn't have holes, it has craters!!!It looks like Milan Lutharia was in a hurry to finish the task at the earliest. Having said of POW premise, please correct me if I am wrong - LOHA was one movie I watched as a kid and was a bloody good engrossing movie." 
" It's a nice entertaining movie.","Amitabh appearing in his old super-hit namesake as Major Ranvir Kaul who is held as a undeclared prisoner of War between India and Pakistan for over 30 odd years with many others. The start of the movie is gripping showing one of the nth attempts made to escape and the will to survive persecution.One attempts by a their mate is partly successful and in conveying the message to Indians. But it is in vain as the Government & Army cannot do anything. The son of Kaul, Akshaye Khanna, takes it upon himself to go to Pakistan and get his father back. Here's the silly part of the ease in how he enters Pakistan and goes about doing the necessary.As a reprimand for the escape attempt the prisoners are moved to a 'high security' prison where they mingle with other similar captives, led by Raj Zutshi. Also there is Sunjay Dutt a goon caught on the border. He somehow manages to escape and in short teams up with Khanna for the escape where he lands up back in the jail (!!).The title 'Let's bring our hero's home' is kind of misnomer as this is no rescue attempt (like Behind Enemy Lines, Saving Private Ryan, etc.). Couple of scenes by Kay Kay (a good playback singer  playing a Pakistani jail officer) and Akhilendra Mishra are impressive. The heroine is a waste. A couple of songs here and there. Though the escape planning, akshaye in Pakistan, and some of them are lame (compared to good Hollywood thrillers) it is a good entertainment package." 
" Totally unrealistic cheap movie on war...","Just want to say one thing about this movie: watch Hindi movie "1971" first, and then watch this one. you'll know the defects and cheapness of this movie. I agree that it's a movie, and therefore will be dramatized. But this much!!! Totally unrealistic. You might want to laugh at some very serious scenes here. Don't want to waste my time reviewing about this movie. If you want to watch a movie on war between India and Pakistan, then watch Border, Tango Charlie, 1971 or Hero. But never this one. The standard of the movie is that of 80s. Watch this one if you want to get frustrated with the director, screenplay, actors and yourself." 
" Awful By Any Standard","Where to begin? #1 Amitabh's son, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30.Amitabh's been in prison for 33+ years... heA) Telepathically transmitted the sperm home?B) Asked a nice Pakistani guard to mail it for him?C) They allow conjugal visits in secret Pakistani JailsD) All of the aboveE) The producers were having a little too much bhang atthe time they approved the script?#2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - he's yum, yum, yummy... and apparently he wants her - who wouldn't, right?!... But, when her dad gets ratted out, and then killed (I hardly think this is a 'spoiler' as you'd have to be brain-dead and blind not to see this coming in the film) he's pretty emotionless towards this catastrophe and with the tip (metaphorically) of his hat, leaves her behind to save his dad, never mind her loss, and says (paraphrasing) "If god wills it, we'll meet again"... Basically meaning, "I'm gonna get my dad and MY job done, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye!" - callus beyond even low-life Hollywood standards...#3) There are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called a movie, that you can drive all the jeeps, trucks camels and any extra stuff through it. Pass - really, complete and total waste of time - Oh! There is a great dance sequence (yes, only one - as in dance sequence - regardless of quality) great belly dancing - but NOT worth watching just for this.Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take acting lessons?) for better Indo-Pak conflict movies... In fact, Veer-Zaara is pretty damned good - 7.5/8 I'd say!" 
" Good Movie.","The attempt to make a good movie should be lauded, in this instance an off-beat Movie that exemplies the bravery of the Indian Army over the Coward dogs that are the captors. The Script is good but I donot see a patriotic son in an attempt to save his father dallying with twins, this is obviously for the demented,degenerate front benchers who are used to equally demented lowlife actors like Sharukh khan in mindless popsicle movies by pubescent directors. Bachchan is good and Dutt is getting better. The movie keeps you glued, has some authentic scenes. The movie is good and we need more of them instead of the trash that is being dished out with same Cast,same choreography,same locations, same jokes. These movies bring back some long needed dignity to the Indian Cinema." 
" Could be much better","In 1975 Amitabh gave a classic DEEWAAR which is remembered even today in 2004 Amitabh returns again with another DEEWAAR this time as an old prisoner of warThe film deals with the story of prisoners of war from India who are caught n arrested since 1971 The film deals with how they wanna escape and how Akshaye wants to save his father The film takes inspiration from 2 English films and also is too filmy Also another problem being the casting of the other actors who are arrested with Bachchan don't look oldThe torture scenes are well handled and Akshaye's journey to Pakistan is well handled too Sanjay Dutt's scenes though cattering towards the masses are well handled The escape is well handled but Sanju's escape is too filmy Even Akshaye- Amrita track could be avoided rest the film is well handled and the second half gets better and till the end keeps you engrossedDirection by Milan Luthria is good in parts, overall average Music is okayAmongst actors Amitabh carries the film on his shoulders and is fantastic throughout 2004 was the best year for him, after KHAKEE, DEV this was his 3rd powerpacked performance Akshaye Khanna excels, sadly nowdays we see him doing c grade films mostly But he was outstanding in this serious role Sanju plays to the gallery and is fun to watch in a clichéd role Kaykay excels in his role Aditya Shrivastav too is fantastic Amrita Rao is avoidable, Tanuja is okay" 
" Not so bad...","This is a pretty OK film... yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient, and the movie doesn't really justify the large star cast (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor that really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK). In the scene where he first meets Amitabh's character, I thought that a man who can just look at AB, keep staring and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he has proved himself worthy again in Sarkar, alongside AB for a second time. This guy should get more roles, he's brilliant.If you've read any of the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plot, and I do agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry into Pakistan was a little too easy. And the little love angle he shared with "what's-her-face" was completely unnecessary. But he is a fairly good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is cool to watch, always. and AB... what can I say. I don't know if I'm his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the spot.An interesting watch, considering it's Bollywood, although a bit inspired by Hollywood oldies like "the Great Escape" and "Bridge on the River Kwai"." 
" Stereotypes !","I love (Amitabh Bachchan); he is a big star who has a good actor, sometimes super good, in him too. However, after his return from the short retirement in the start of the 1990s, he used to make a bunch of movies per year where one is good, and the rest is not. Typical I think for a man who wants to be in business all the time. In 2004, he made 11 movies, at least (Deewaar) wasn't one of their "worst"!The movie's intro was so impressive and engaging. It promised me with real great time. And to tell you the truth, the movie was kind of entertaining, but why after its ending, it collapsed easily?!Now this is a movie which wants to handle the issue of the Indian internees in Pakistan, and how they're victims of both sides. So the personal solution is the only way. But the treatment of the whole thing made it as another B movie, with the good and bad meanings of the term. Despite that everything and everyone looked serious, it was handled usuriously. All the characters were just stereotypes, without any possible deepness. There was some naivety behind a lot of the events. So ultimately the movie was superficial more than simple.Observe carefully; (Sanjay Dutt)'s character seemed at first as the perfect opportunist selfish who could literally run over the dead bodies of his fellow prisoners just to flee. Then, SUDDENLY, he became that faithful altruist patriotic who sacrificed his own life for the others, and cried to not be buried in Pakistan??!! Then this cripple sadistic warden? What's his story? And why he is for-no-reason a forever evil? But originally why to answer all of that since he's here as the B movie's villain!Moreover, (Akshaye Khanna) as the son; aside from being so pale and non-charismatic, his role was so empty to the utmost: what's his work besides being a saver?! For a moment, I imagined that he was an officer in his country's government, who got angry and resigned for doing what that government's law was unable of. But none of my reveries was true. (Bachchan) was just an angry "old" man, and the genius presence would solve the rest. He was a character without any particulars or history. As a whole, this movie had no real humans, rather characters in a cartoon; where Mickey is good, Pete is bad, and Goofy is goofy!Extra annoying points: How the son sneaked into the enemy's country? How he knew already that his father has been transported to another prison? And the Indian prisoner, who was hiding under the Pakistani military car while the transporting, what did he intent to do anyway? Though, still the strongest Mumbo Jumbo here was the storyline of the traitorous; what a lousy one! It makes you ask eagerly: if he was that long time rat, then why he didn't inform about the whole matter of the tunnel from the start?!There is a clear general irony about it; as it has some attractive moving plot, however with hasty dealing. It isn't lazy in making action, though it is in making the rest. For instance, what could be the difference between someone who was never in a Pakistani prison, knowing nothing about its life's details, and the one who wrote this movie? Totally NOTHING! Sure the script lacked distinctive details to separate the movie from other movies such as (The Great Escape - 1963), to have its own personality, to be more original, and to live longer among its likes.The love story between the Indian boy and the Pakistani girl could have been one of the highest points of the script, representing the peaceful tone of the movie, and epitomizing implied message about circumstances which made this love impossible. But I think that line had been epitomized itself.I extremely loved the first sequence. "Todenge Deewar Hum" as the prisoners' anthem. The respectable, always intense, performance of (Bachchan) despite that the role didn't give him what could make it one of his finest roles indeed. The smart, enjoyable, and technically dexterous directing of (Milan Luthria); it got wonderful moments, and on their top was the scene of hanging one of the Indian prisoners as the new prison's reception; that was one memorable piece of "cinema", to the extent of being a visual poetry.(Deewaar) determined to be the commercial Indian movie. So, no wonder that everything was just hot moment after another, no wonder that there was an hot number, and no wonder that (Bachchan)'s character killed the warden brutally at the end, while it would've been better if he was kept alive, taken to India as an internee, and tasted an equal portion of his torture. But who said anything about sane ending; it is A BOLLYWOOD FLICK where all the good Indians must triumph, all the evil Pakistanis must go to hell, and all the audience must come out of theaters happy, entertained and satisfied. Just thank God that it didn't contain: 700 songs, forced melodrama, superfluous comedy, or over-the-top acting.It's above average as an action movie. But needed less shallowness and more authenticity to be a great movie." 
" This film is not Bad, It's just that it's not good either!","It seems so much like rhetoric, that the minute it begins you already know how it is going to end. The only thing you might not be able to guess are the people who are going to die and in which order they do so.Amitabh Bachchan plays an army major who along with over three dozen Indian soldiers are trapped in Pakistani prisons and are all presumed dead. It's not like India doesn't want to recover them, it's that's for 33 years, Pakistan has maintained that they do not have any Indian soldier prisoners. Ranvir Kaul (Bachchan), desperate and determined not to die on Pakistani soil has tried to escape from the death camp 17 times, all unsuccessful attempts until one day, when he sabotages a routine trip and allows one of his fellow soldier who is also bearing a letter to escape. The man makes it into the slums of Pakistan and is helped by a fellow Hindustani but dies before he can be nursed back to health. Before he dies, he hands his good Samaritan a letter which is then sent to India to alert the military that their soldiers are still alive. The government is hesitant to take the letter as authentic, but when Gaurav Kaul (played by Akshaye Khanna) hears of this, he vows to his mother that he will go to Pakistan and bring his father home. Thus, begins a tumultuous descent to the depths of despair as he slowly becomes a rebel with a cause. Upon reaching Pakistan, he traces the origin of the letter to the person who sent it and when he arrives at the man's home, he meets a girl named Radhika (played by Amrita Rao) who is also the man's daughter. Naturally, she falls in love with him but he keeps his focus on his plans. When upon the 19th prison break, a mysterious stranger named Khan (played by Sanjay Dutt) escapes and is rescued by Gaurav, signs of hope begin to materialise. The best part of the film for me is surprising not the liberation of the soldiers but the song and dance that occurs between Gaurav and Radhika, one of the rare songs in the film, which is also a highlight of the film. Amrita Rao looks so heavenly in this song and the playback singer matches her so perfectly that you would believe she is the one actually singing the song. The worst part of the film is the fact that Gaurav leaves her behind in Pakistan, after all the bad luck he brings upon her all in the name of saving his own father. I mean what sort of fate did he bestow upon the poor girl by leaving her behind after fracturing her life?"
