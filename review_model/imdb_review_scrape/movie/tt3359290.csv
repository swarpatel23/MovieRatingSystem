" well tried","On the whole good movie made. All the supporting actors chosen were good. Good to see kiran kumar after long time.vidya balan ( ulf lady Bachchan ) played the role with ease.Songs in these movies sometimes I believe looses the momentum. Producers also need to have faith that movies can sell without songs.Direction and scripting could have been better.One question keeps coming to my mind, why was kiran kumar specially shown carrying a gun to meet ali .... there is no logic . Director forced the audience on something which was un reasonable. Its 6 star but 1 extra for attempt for trying to make a normal cinema. Dia mirza and others its good having faith on such movies." 
" Two and Half Month Draught was over","...........Bobbie Jasoos:3.75/5 Finally the 2 and a half month drought was over.....After 2 states, I went in and out of the theaters to watch something new and good....but disappointed....This time juss keeping in mind that it is a Vidya Balan starer, I started watching the movie, It started Tickling me, giggles, sometime louder ones escaped my lips....so the first part was so full of laughter doses...It was all about Vidya Balan and her acting credibilities.....she wooed me again, simple lines bought to perfection by the Stunner Vidya....As the story Proceeds, It maintains its pace between comedy and the detective part. The twist and turns were simple but created perfectly, and were beautifully portrayed by Vidya.....The Story was simple and subtle, Mughalpuri was Colorful...But Ali Fazal was Like a Ace ....He should get more Films....The pairing was So beautiful, that their age difference was hardly noticeable.....She was Supported by an excellent Supporting star cast Of Supriya Pathak, Zarina Wahab, Tanvi Azmi and Rajesh Gupta...Each and every one of the Supporting crew acted really well.....Director Samar Seikh Did a good job....Applause...Among the tracks....Sweety an Arziyaan my favorites....Definitely a Must watch.....For Vidya Dons various Disguises and roams around MughalPuri with grace....." 
" Entertainment. Entertainment. Illogical. ♦ 59%","The realization you gather that the whole film could've been done without the title character is ironical. But then the makers would have been jobless and also, the people behind other departments of this film wouldn't have got the opportunity to showcase their talents.The film is built on a make-believe story: an aspiring female detective finds herself defying odds and in between a mystery where a rich boss hires her to find three specific people. The climax succeeds in disclosing this mystery but it is foolish enough for the audience to actually believe it; the story I mean. That is where Bobby Jasoos stumbles.The first half is brilliant, funny and entertaining. It creates an aura as Bobby (Balan) spearheads her character with blink-and-you-miss multiple characters, donning various colorful costumes and masquerading as a beggar, astrologer, peon, what-not. It is evident that the film was written with Balan in mind. Rest of the cast are equally supportive of the narration. The screenplay is sweet: while the first one hour is used up to narrate the life of Bobby & her family and her acquaintances, the second half is averagely gripping. It never bores.Art dept., costumes, make-up, locations & technical dept. all are top- notch. I couldn't bear the songs but they are negligible. There are at least 3 scenes that can be counted in some of the best films sequences in Bollywood this year.BOTTOM LINE: I hate to sound equivocal. So, Bobby Jasoos is a definite recipe for entertainment, but falters when thinking movie-goers find and deride and ridicule and debate the pretentious story it so heavily depends on. Balan fans rejoice. Watchable!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" Bobby Jasoos - half baked, self pretentious attempt by director but a bold attempt to do something different","While my choice of genre doesn't really allow me to digest modern popcorn blockbuster Bollywood movies, I often tend to enjoy them occasionally if served with a good story and execution. I will have to say that Bobby Jasoos was not one of them.Bobby Jasoos seems to be a half baked, self pretentious attempt in directing by Samar Shaikh and endorsed by Diya Mirza as a Producer, whose skills could have been better utilized as an actress to save this movie a little.The story of Bobby Jasoos is about a 30 year old Muslim girl named Bobby, residing in the heart of Hyderabad city near the iconic Charminar. While she keeps herself involved in investigating cases in night and trying to get a proper detective job in daytime. She is having a rough time in securing clients as a detective, but luck takes a big turn as she receives an assignment that pushes her to her limits. Rest of the film is a riot as she tries to struggle her career as a detective and manage her family emotionally who doesn't seem to be in favor of what Bobby does.While the film seems to have so much potential what makes it fail is the treatment. The film starts of in a humorous tone and actually seems like to begin with the right foot. But as it picks up pace we are introduced some of the people that seems like a cliché examples of typical characters from all of the Bollywood movies I detest watching. Slowly the viewer is faced with slapstick humor, family drama and been-there-done-that events that feels like Deja Vu in the course of a family drama movie.Songs don't help either. Neither of the songs in the film leaves an impression on the viewers mind, rather give them a chance to take a break and catch up on sleep while they are at it. There is one particular song in the movie which I won't specify to stay away from spoilers, and which I personally think was totally uncalled for in the situation. Perhaps the pacing or editing could have been a lot better, so as to give the movie a coherent flow.In this movie Vidya Balan in the role of Bobby gets to change in a lot of getup (around 12) but most of them doesn't help the story in much ways. It looks as if she was made to change just for the sake of humor. While the film can be considered short at just 121 minutes, it feels somewhat dragged occasionally, and fails to let viewers invest their emotions into any of the characters except of the lead character.That being said, the film does have its moments but those are just a few. I would also say it was a daring attempt to try to execute a movie with only a female lead, who for the most part remains out of glamor, and where she is also shown to break free from many of the stereotypical role a women is portrayed in Indian movies. I would also have to admire Vidya Balan for his acting skills as he was very convincing in all of those getup she did on screen. I would not blame the execution of the movie on her since the onus of the complete movie lied on her shoulders alone. And she did her role perfectly.It would be fair to say that while the first half of Bobby Jasoos, raises viewers interest a little, second half helps it raise even further, but the final twist fails to live up to the expectation.One more movie "Queen" was also released recently where the story was about a female lead who is shown to break free from various stereotypical roles, but it would be unfair to compare both of them, because while Queen was set up in vibrant and colorful foreign cities like Paris and Amsterdam and was more closer to today's generation, Bobby Jasoos relates more to India and typical Indian family drama, and was filmed totally in the streets of semi urban parts of Hyderabad which gave the movie a special flavor of India, more closer to most of the people of the country.Combined with all other things I would rate the film a 6 out of 10. Extra 1 to give Bollywood a break from the male dominant masala movie and an attempt to create India's own Sherlock Holmes." 
" Nice Entertainer","I went to watch this movie today and I enjoyed it. Its a light hearted movie which is a good diversion from the regular love stories which are manufactured every other week.The movie revolves around how the a middle class girl is trying to make a mark for her and break out of the stereo mindset which surrounds the general public.The star cast is great especially the lead actors. Its always good to watch Vidya Balan perform on big screen. She never disappoints.The music is also nice with just a couple of nice songs.I would recommend this movie which has elements to make you laugh and cry." 
" bobby Jasoos is a Sloppy Jasoos","Many a times we have witnessed that a strong script or promising plot needs a good direction else it crumbles down on screen. It can happen to any movie whether Hollywood or any other movie industry globally. Bobby Jasoos is no exception in this case. After a long time in Bollywood where fans of suspense or thriller genre were feeling excited after watching the trailers of this movie. As it promised a very entertaining plot similar to the classic Japanese series of Hibari Torimonocho where a female detective in ancient Japan investigates cases. And those movies were pretty entertaining even if swordplay or action was equally involved in increasing the stakes for characters. I am a great fan of suspense movies as i have been infuenced with the stories of writers like Robert Laudlum, Dan Brown, Greg Iles, Stephen L Cater and less known Indian writers like Ved Prakash Sharma. It does not require one to involve every trick of the trade to make a suspense or thriller it just take a promising plot and to provide enough twists that the audience do not loose interest. But same can not be said about this movie. Vidya Balan is playing the lead female detective who do not possess any academic qualification or skills and experience in solving crimes except following neighborhood adults for spying so that she can break off the engagement of the paying party or whose son has started smoking/drinking. She is obsessed with making it big as a female detective and looking for her big break. She is amidst the family expectations of her father in a traditional middle class Muslim family of southern Indian town. Her father and mother wants her to get settled with Tasawur(Ali Fazal)her client cum source TV Reporter, who hires her every now and then to get rid off marriage proposals sent by his own father. While trying to adjust her personal and professional life one day she gets her big break when a client (Kiran Kumar) mysteriously appears and offers her big amount just to find someone and the silly approaches used by her takes the story further with lots of twists and turns where the intentions of this mysterious client are unknown and suspicion of bobby begins to build up.On the whole you can put the performance in two parts. the first part is before the interval where it felts like the movie has indeed something good to offer. All the elements of a good story building are here. And expectations gets high. But in post interval any person who has seen even a single suspense movie can tell the climax way before the ending (not exactly but one get the feel what could be the possible scenarios in their gut). So once the movie finished i wished if i could meet the director and can give him couple of my ideas on how to make story better if next time he tries his hands on the suspense again. Vidya Balan played her part and she was fine in her given role. but what makes a detective detective is not relative here. It is just a pain to watch such a promising plot go down the drain. If Indian directors wants to know how a suspense or detective thriller movie should be made just watch this Hong Kong movie The Detective(2007) starring Aaron Kwok. I am mad because this movie could have been a block buster with the kind of plot the director had and still they cannot give a spine chilling or maddening suspense thriller. The male lead has done a good job and he looks comfortable along with Vidya. The Veteran Kiran Kumar had nothing more to do but why stay limited at one bad guy. The one complaint that i had with the movie is why the director did not used his imagination in creating a real Jasoosi story whose tile involves the word Jasoos itself. I believe the producers also are a reason in India as why the promising plots does not turns out to be a good movie. They worry too much and do not allows a new or less known director to give the freedom in experimenting with the story. The Music in the movie was not required at all and is not pleasing. None of the songs will be remembered by any one. So instead of wasting good 20-22 minutes of audience some of the work on story would have been nice. But it is of no use. The movie is a one time watch. It will please to some audience who have not been able to enjoy any good quality suspense movies in recent time. But it is opinion of just one man who has seen movies of every other country and knows the elements of a good suspense story telling.Characters have worked hard no doubt about it. It is easy to criticize the actors or movie but it takes real hard work in making them as well and i really appreciate all your hard work. but this complaint i am making is just because i know we can make good cinema but sometimes we can do better as we have all the things we require. So keeping my fingers crossed for future as someone in Bollywood may have better talent in making such suspense stories a treat for everyone.My Rating 5/10." 
" Bobby Jasoos, though with not so-strong script / screenplay, is watchable for Vidya, Ali, and its other cast and their performances.","Bobby Jasoos, a film by Samar Shaikh, could have been another Vidya Balan hit with the very novel concept of a female detective, a very unconventional profession for a female to be in, but something is amiss which hasn't worked in its favour. Post 'The Dirty Picture' and 'Kahaani', Vidya Balan has set her own benchmarking level of performance quite high. Her 'Ghanchakkar' was super flop, and 'Shaadi ke Side Effects' could do only decent business. Bobby Jasoos probably faltered as far as the script is concerned; otherwise, its concept had all the elements of another blockbuster in Vidya's kitty. But yes, it is a movie, which prompts us to pursue our dreams irrespective of challenges. Bilkis Ahmed aka Bobby (Vidya Balan) is so passionate about proving her mettle as a detective against the wishes of her family. Only her mother Zebo (Supriya Pathak) supports her whereas father (Rajendra Gupta) and others at home are dead against her detective job. Her father has a conservative approach and he feels that the house shall not be run with the girl's earning. He also feels that Bobby is a disgrace to the family due to her profession. Zebo does bring smile to our face while she tries to defend Bobby and her detective activities.Bobby keeps trying her luck at G-Force detective agency in spite of facing rejections from the agency again and again. She starts her own detective agency after challenging the agency. She handles insipid cases like worried parents, suspicious spouses etc. A tea shop person Munna (Aakash Dahiya) does help her to get clients. She dons variety of looks viz. that of a beggar, palmist, bangle-seller, astrologer, peon, a TV producer etc. as part of her solving cases effortlessly. She approaches every case on the basis of her intuition and gut feeling and chooses strange paths to crack the same. Her familiarity with the streets of Mughalpura Mohalla of old Hyderabad fetches her a strange case from Anees Khan (Kiran Kumar) to find out two missing young girls with strange birthmarks, followed by search for a guy as well. She is paid hefty amount. Anees just wants Bobby to do her job without raising any question about his motive in looking out for these missing people. Bobby goes ahead following her mind and heart, but then, she starts doubting the motive of Anees behind his search for the girls. The story moves ahead from there. Indeed, suspense is maintained till the very end. Shetty (Prasad Barve), Munna, Sohail (Tejas Mahajan) act as perfect aides of Bobby Jasoos. They do add lot of comic elements to the plot. Ali Fazal as a TV anchor Tassavur Shaikh has given a very sweet performance. He is ambitious and does not want to settle down with girls of Mughalpura. And to escape from the marriage proposals brought to him by his father (Vinay Varma), he takes the help from Bobby to explore some stories about them so that he could conveniently deny those proposals. It is interesting to see Bobby and Tassavur together and how their relationship goes to the next level. There is a nice scene, where Bobby is guiding Tassavur over speaker/earphone set to speak to his father in regard to his disapproval to marry Bobby. Bobby's sister Noor (Benaf Dadachandji), Kausar Khaala (Tanvi Azmi) and Zarina Wahab as Afreen's (Afreen is Lala's love interest) Ammi have also added value to the movie through their presence. What events unfold in the lives of Bobby Jasoos? Lala (Arjan Bajwa) as a local gunda plays a significant part in the movie and what is that? Does Ali and Bobby come together? What is the motive of Anees Khan? How does Bobby explore the same? Is Bobby able to win her father's approval and love?Cinematographer Vishal Sinha has captured the hustle-bustle of Hyderabad, Charminar, the very aroma of Biriyani also very nicely. Hyderabad is reflected well through Bobby's accent. Vidya has really worked upon her Hyderabadi accent." 
" It is Vidya Balan's show all the way in this average drama","Indian Cinema has certainly evolved over the years with experimental movies Queen, Holiday , Filmistaan to name few. Bobby Jasoos succeeds in experimenting the truth but final act pauses the entire movement of the film.Bobby Jasoos tells the story of a wanna-be-detective(Vidya Balan) who has been given a secret assignment to search for people whose identities are provided by a multi-millionaire unknown guy. Directed by Samir Shaikh , Bobby Jasoos starts off well with few hilarious moments in the first half with the doubt factor remains till the end. Unfortunately , the movie tumbles in the climax which could have been made better. Editing is loose. Screenplay is weak . Cinematography and art direction is simple. Music is below par. Background score does not gel well with film. Dialogues are good. It is Vidya Balan's show all the way. The actress gets into the character of Bobby Jasoos and gives a performance with aplomb.Overall, a very brave niche flick with commendable first half and not so engrossing later half. Average 2.5/5" 
" Jasoosi(spying) made easy","Viday Balan has owned the character of a young woman living in the Hyderabad old city. As the movie is totally centered upon her character, it's a commendable job not to make it boring. The screenplay and a bit of situational humor helped the smooth flow of the movie.The movie starts with a good surprising introduction scene and goes on pleasantly to introduce the complete picture of Bobby's world. The interval break arrives at the right point as Bobby gets surrounded by the problems: missing girls, unwanted marriage proposal, her father's restraint to talk to her and her friend's love affair with Lala. The second half reveals how Bobby deals with them, with some compassionate scenes.The thing that goes against the film is its small subject that all eventually come to. Also, the many disguises that Bobby wears seem unnecessary most of the time." 
" Vidya Balan at Her Very Best in Another Richly Layered Script","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 starsBobby lives in Mughalpura's tight, twisting lanes, supported by her adoring mother Zebo (Pathak), censured by her stern father, and criticized by her marriage-arranger aunt. Bobby's determined to crack cases, achieve her dreams, and make her family proud – but what happens when a rich stranger Anees Khan hires her to track young girls? And when she finds herself engaged to cocky TV star Tasavvur (Ali) – who wants her to reject him?"Bobby Jasoos" is a Hyderabadi pearl of a movie, worn with terrific aplomb by its star Vidya Balan. Playing the 30-year-old Bilquis or Bobby, who has no detective course but fearless passion, Vidya dazzles as Bobby Jasoos, tracking mysteries as a buck-toothed palmist, a dreadlocked sadhu, a hobbling fakir – suddenly distilled into a tongue- tied girl who discovers love.Post Kahaani, it is clear that roles are now written with Vidya Balan in mind. Her spirited performance in the title role justifies this decision. Vidya runs away with "Bobby Jasoos". Her effervescence rubs off on the proceedings and gives it an energy that drives the film. She is both the film's hero and heroine, performing with deft innocence, presenting Bobby like a breeze. But her leading man Tasavvur is also nailed by Ali Fazal, who captures the urge for a radical shift in lifestyle in keeping with his education, fluent English vocabulary, and promising career as a new presenter. Along the way he also effortlessly blends with the humor of getting engaged to madcap Bobby – and the sudden, delicate power of discovering love. Ali impresses with his acting while Arjan Bajwa, as local goonda Lala, impresses with his smoldering looks, soorma, and stubble, making Bajwa steamier than ever before.Besides the lead performers, the impressive list of supporting actors also lends gravitas to the colorful Hyderabadi canvas, which proves once again that casting good actors in bit roles pays off. Tanvi Azmi stands out in a small, sharp role as Bobby's tart-tongued khaala; Rajendra Gupta nails Bobby's disgruntled dad who's conflicted due to his conservative roots that clash with his paternal love; while Supriya Pathak shines as the doting Mother who perennially serves as a mediator between Bobby and her Dad while assuaging the simmering tension in the household. Even the jasoos' merry men, Shetty, Munna and Suhail, leaving a fine imprint upon the tale. Finally, it's a sheer delight to see Kiran Kumar back after ages and with the same delectable form of yore.Technically, too, "Bobby Jasoss" hits most of the right notes. The film clearly boasts a cinematographer (Vishal Sinha) who thinks, which is more than evident in the realism of the by-lanes, street vendors, and dingy apartments of Hyderabad depicted on screen. Shantanu Moitra's background score and musical numbers is unobtrusive yet pleasing. The editing by Hemal Kothari is good, but could have been better, as the second half of the movie tends to relax in some places when it could have been tauter. However, this is a minor flaw, in an otherwise, well- executed film.There are many fine things about "Bobby Jasoos" - a terrific lead performance, a great supporting cast, surprising attention to detail, and Hyderabad in full glory. Debutant Director, Samar Shaikh, impresses as he deftly balances the primary detective track with the personal travails of Vidya's character. An aspiring female detective in Hyderabad has her work cut out to be taken seriously, and the often bumbling but ever optimistic Bobby wins clients and hearts with equal ease. But the outright winner is the film's writing, the quality of which is not often seen in Bollywood today, and no more amount of praise would be too great for Sanyukta Chawla's screenplay and dialogues.The old-world charm of Hyderabad is ideal foil for the narrative. It is one of the lovely touches that give the film real texture. The authenticity of the setting, locations, and the flawlessly consistent diction of every major and minor character contribute in making the proceedings all the more engaging.Minor quibbles aside, "Bobby Jasoos" is a clever and joyful film. It's a light, breezy, and delightful caper with a lot of heart, and you root for both the film and its protagonist all the way till the end." 
" Mediocre Jasoosi with Balan Shining",""Bobby Jasoos" is a comedy-suspense-drama that centers around Bilkis "Bobby" Ahmed(Vidya Balan), a late-20-something girl of a lower-middle class family who aspires to be a professional private detective. She faces several personal and professional hurdles in her endeavour, and thus, continues to fight her way through with the help of her friends – an internet cafe owner, a coffee house waiter and a TV crime- reporter(Ali Fazal). Bobby strike something big when a mystic middle- aged wealthy NRI(Kiran Kumar) turns up on her doorstep to figure the whereabouts of some individuals with just their names and physical identities, whom she does discover from nothing after much articulate labour and earns fat paychecks in return. However, Bobby senses something sinister all over. Would she be able to discover the truth about the man and his investigations? As one could spot, the film is pretty much straight and has very minimal level of plot-suspense to present. Its an age-old remedy that is given a new avatar and a new packaging.PLUSES- Balan is the backbone of the film, as simple as that. She has a tom- boyish charm and anger in her persona therefore, she plays through different disguises ably and effortlessly. Fazl is highly effective as the patro-phobic young man who is trying to shy away from all marriage proposals coming his way and strikes a friendship with Bobby as she is doing her job to find faults in his proposals. Other castings are good, too, however no one gets enough screen-time to be more than meager supporting-characters with the exception of Kiran Kumar. Make-up and Costume Design play a significant role throughout and give a film a stage-performance kind of touch at places. Also, the film's duration is less - a little more than 2 hours – i.e. before the film could actually become boring for some.MINUSES- There is definite lack of screenplay-work and which is the reason that there is no certain sequencing or flow of events in the film. This is the reason that in the first-half viewers don't enjoy it as much because they were always trying to find something to hold on to. Being Dia Mirza's debut production, there were not much expectations either. Although the direction (Samar Shaikh) did try hard but failed to hold the film compactly. The music(Shantanu Moitra) is unfortunately totally forgettable and the song sequences are not at all worth watching – with the exception of "Tu".VERDICT- Bobby Jasoos is an average-level film it offers nothing extraordinary. Still it's full of simple-ordinary stuff which makes it a light watch. Likable because of Balan, and any of her ardent admirer would rather find it much enjoyable than others. Watch if you really must - a 6/10." 
" Bobby Jasoos arrives as a rare clean, fun, mainstream entertainer that an entire family could watch together.","Bobby Jasoos wastes no time. The very first scene introduces us to the antiques of this talented private detective who wishes to make it big but as of now is only making small money on petty cases - like snooping on lovers and working on extra-marital cases. Set in Moghalpura, Hyderabad, Bobby Jasoos is the story of a woman who wants to become a famous detective.

" Bobby Jasoos: A thriller without thrills","Vidya Balan strikes back as "Bobby Jasoos" wherein she plays an amateurish detective. But does it really create an impact????? In the beginning of the movie you get introduced to the world of Mughalpura in Hyderabad, the place where Bobby Jasoos stays and her struggle to become a famous detective and her immediate family of sisters and Khala's. Life changes for her when a stranger Anees Khan (Kiran Kumar) gives her an assignment to find out a girl Nilofer in Mughalpura. Who is Anees Shaikh and why does he want to know about the girl.forms the rest of the plot.Written by Samyukta Chawla Shaikh, the story and screenplay emphasizes not only on Bilkis Ahmed's a.k.a Bobby Jasoos's professional adventure but also her personal life and somewhere in the story and screenplay that takes pretence and the movie looses completely on the aspect of edge of seat thriller which is expected from a detective movie. There are many characters introduced in the movie but many of them have no relevance to the main plot. The sequence which involves Bobby's personal life is very well written. After an hour especially post interval is when the screenplay just falls flat and the not so impactful climax does not help either.Debutant director Samar Shaikh tries his best to make the setting as realistic as possible and is successful as well, right from the dialect of all the characters to the settings, but where the movie falters is the absence of thrill which is expected from a movie based on a detective.It is the superlative performances of the ensemble cast which lifts the movie. Vidya Balan as Bilkis Ahmed/ Bobby Jasoos does a good job. Ali Fazal as Tasawur is earnest in his portrayal but somewhere he gets overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Other cast like Arjan Bajwa, Supriya Pathak, Kiran Kumar, Aakash Dahiya, Rajendra Gupta, Benaf Dadachanji and Prasad Barve do a fantastic job rising above the writing. Tanvi Azmi and Zarina Wahab are excellent but are wasted in brief roles.Another highlight of the movie is the Production Design and the Costumes. Production Design by Tariq Umar Khan is spot on and very realistic, the same goes for the costumes by Thei Tekchandaney & Sheetal Sharma which absolutely blends with the narration.The third highlight is the Cinematography by Vishal Sinha which captures Hyderabad especially the locality of Charminar like a dream.Shatanu Moitra's music is average excluding one song "Arziyaan"..After watching the movie I was confused whether I liked the movie or did not like it, so I came to the conclusion that it is a" Thriller without the Thrills" I will go with five Stars, watch it for its performances..." 
" Vidya Balan never fails to impress us","She's honestly finest actor I've known and really appreciated with her skills on it.But I've been expecting the story line need to be more genuine and serious which came out confusion in between of the film." 
" Adorable","This film is about a struggling detective who tastes success after a sudden roller coaster ride. Bobby is extremely likable and her character is very well written. She is very human, with her little dreams and aspirations. She has her strengths, and her weaknesses. Her sharp mind and careful observation is what makes her fit into her ambition. Added to this, she is very lively and a little naughty that gives the movie a nice, fun spirit. Her story strikes a chord in the heart, without asking for sympathy. The events are well laid out, and the movie does not bore you for a minute.Performance wise, its Vidya who runs the show with her confidence and fine nuances. She does a splendid job again after kahani and dirty picture. She fits into Bobby's character with ease, and does not impose her real stardom onto it. The hero is likable too, and seems to be made for his role. Arjun, Supriya, Benaf and other supporting cast are very realistic in their minimal roles. Kiran Kumar shines as always.The music is pretty humdrum, and could have been avoided altogether.My only gripe is that the story seems a little stretched out, and the climax felt like it was out of a fairytale. Still, no harm done in this cute little affair that belongs to Bobby Jasoos a.k.a. Vidya. Looking forward to the sequel." 
" A baseless comedy and boring thriller","Vidya Balan starrer Bobby Jasoos is an attempted comedy-cum-drama. Set in Hyderabad, Bobby is an aspiring and struggling detective without any education qualification and managing to investigate few love affairs in her neighborhood. She pursues her jasoosi career much to the disapproval of her Muslim family. The story is centered around Bobby getting hired by Khan (Kiran Kumar) to find 3 people based on age, name and birth marks, for which Bobby gets paid heavily. Bobby is helped by 2 amusing companions who keep the comic theme running in the movie. Subsequently, Bobby finds out that she is part of a larger conspiracy plotted by Khan to kidnap the missing people. Bobby gets involved in unearthing Khan's motives, mired with her personal problems of family's disapproval and wedding arrangement.The movie begins on interesting caricatures where Vidya Balan takes the lead, but gradually the movie becomes a lackluster. Vidya Balan has played her part wonderfully well, however the film is neither thrilling nor comic, and to top it up ends up on a melodramatic note. Shot extensively in Hyderabad, the movie has a very local background-setting. Music is all over the film and in very bad shape. Wish the directorial debut of Samar Shaikh could have been a better piece of work!"
