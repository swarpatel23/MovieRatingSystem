" Who came up with this stuff?","Bland... That about says it all. Probably the most uninteresting movie in history. The plot lines of most daytime soaps are thicker. My apologies go out to the actors who must have had to have worked so hard to fool themselves into thinking that this movie may one day succeed in pleasing a single audience member. My suggestion to potential viewers of this film: buy some paint with the money you would've otherwise spent on renting this movie, paint something, and then watch the paint dry. Believe me, you'll have gained something. Watching this movie, you'll only gain the knowledge that you've somehow lost two hours of your life."
