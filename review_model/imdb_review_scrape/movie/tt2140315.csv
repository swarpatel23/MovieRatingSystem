" A better attempt by Vikram which does have its usual flaws.","Vishesh Films have recently found a new formula of success apart from their earlier fixed patterns of film-making, which is en-cashing the brand name of their previous hits through their so called sequels. The audiences easily relate to the 'Title' with their fond memories of the original and then opt for its sequel, expecting a similar kind of output from the same. And the Bhatts have easily managed to make some money from their last such ventures, even though they were all pretty weak films as per their subject and execution. But here in RAAZ 3 they surprisingly come up with at least something to watch, despite of having its usual flaws and drawbacks.Beginning with its weaker points, the film strictly follows the decades old rule of Hindi Cinema wherein Horror Films must have some unwanted sex and songs too to provide the required relief to the viewers. So, RAAZ 3 also has many similar sequences wherein the camera starts from the legs itself, the heroine seduces the hero to commit a serious crime and the couple suddenly decides to lock their lips just after a terrifying moment, making you laugh instead of getting frightened. But what pinches you even more than these forced sex scenes are the songs which hinder the pace of the film hugely and don't really have some listening value too, which is usually not a feature of Vishesh Films. Background score also remains screechy and loud which fails to create any kind of terror needed before all those horrifying moments on the screen. In fact, while watching it I fondly remembered the subtle and intelligent use of minimum background score by the South Asian film- makers in their brilliant Horror films such as RINGU,SHUTTER, JU-ON and many more.In short if you edit out that one funny kissing scene and all the songs from the film, replacing its routine background score with an experimental one, then RAAZ 3 does become a watchable movie (better than many recent trashy projects) having few positive points as mentioned below.As its very first plus point, though not anything fresh but thankfully it does have a believable storyline written around the subject of love, jealousy and competition involved in the film business itself. One may call it completely imaginary and superstitious but there have been real life unconfirmed stories of allegations made by actors on each other of using Black Magic in the past. And that only becomes the basic premise of the storyline in RAAZ 3 which was also earlier used in HO SAKTA HAI (2004) and PHOONK (2008).Secondly, the film cannot be called only a Horror movie as it does have some human relationship angles incorporated in its script which actually help in converting it into a one- time watch. So its not the same old, ugly looking Ghost following the whole cast and killing them one by one to take his revenge. R3 has got the elements of sibling jealousy, love and hatred along with an undercurrent of GUILT running throughout the film, felt by its lead hero Emraan Hashmi. Though I wished that this guilt factor could have been used more brightly in its second half but still the director doesn't waste it completely.Thirdly RAAZ 3 also has few appreciable scenes like the one where Bipasha meets the Black Magic man for the first time, the climax confronting the Ghost and the Cockroach attack sequence post intermission which can easily be rated as one of the boldest suggestive scenes filmed on a lead actress in the recent times.Regarding the performances, honestly there is nothing exceptional but still Bipashaemotes well caught in the rage of jealousy against her rival actress. However I really didn't find her enjoying her dances at all. Esha does much better than her previous films in the role of the victimized lady and Emraan Hashmi surprisingly plays it real cool in a controlled manner which works at times. Manish Chaudhari as the Evil Spirit doesn't get much scope but he still excels in his few scenes. The film's cinematography together with a fine art direction (Indoor Sets) manages to take you in and out of world of spirits successfully. Hence they all work together to a certain extent, majorly because the director remains focused on his story- telling too along with the Horror genre of his film.Moreover, unlike Vikram's last venture (DANGEROUS ISHQ), he doesn't rely excessively on either the 3D factor or the Special Effects used, which eventually brings in a certain kind of balance in the film resulting in a better product. That is if you watch it in 3D then you are sure going to get many things coming on to you as expected. But if you prefer watching it in 2D then also the film remains the same as it is not hugely dependent upon the technology to generate any bigger impact.In all, RAAZ 3 may not be anything great or path-breaking but it still has its moments which might work more in the smaller centers where the sex-horror genre has certainly got a mass appeal." 
" Dull plot, clich√©d attempts at horror, worthless movie","With Raaz 3, the Bhatt camp continues to explore the viewer's fascination with the afterlife and the occult, liberally borrowing plot elements from a host of Hollywood movies that have acquired a cult following. These would at least include "The Exorcist" (priest exorcism), "House of Wax" (abandoned studio), "Resident Evil" (close-ups of freaky monster), "Nightmare on Elm Street" (the girl can't sleep), "Drive-thru" and "We all scream for ice-cream" (for the scary clown).Apparently, the Bhatt camp took the misquoted sentence "Copying from one source is plagiarism, copying from multiple sources is Research" in a plain wrong way. In the words of Emraan Hashmi from this very movie, do they think the audience is dumb enough not to care about this kind of "chutia-paa"? Come on, Mr. Bhatt, give us something original, just sprinkling some Indian flavour where Ganeshji loans a trident to the hero so he can fight Evil in the end doesn't quite absolve you of plagiarism. The worst part is the didactic manner in which the Bhatts explain stuff about the afterlife; almost, as if Class 6 students are being introduced to a History subject. "This is called Black Magic", "This potion of water is laced with black magic", "Now you go to the world of souls where you fight the baddies", "If God doesn't answer your prayer, come to the Devil. He might help you." Every time one of these dialogues flashed on screen, I couldn't help but yawn.The only redeeming feature about this movie is Bipasha Basu. I think she showed some strong conviction in her acting - Esha and Emraan looked jaded and Esha's histrionics were a bit over-the-top. Manish Chaudhary, I generally consider him a good actor but this time, he somewhat failed to convince in the role of Satan." 
" Let This Raaz be a Raaz.. Don't waste your time and money unraveling it....","Well its a yet another addition to the sad collection of the 'so called' bollywood Genre of horror and this time it's again from the "Bhatt Camp".Mahesh Bhatt along with Vikram Bhatt have made it a pain stricken habit (especially for the general public), to pick up their used up movie titles which had earlier managed to make money and generate popularity, and cook it up with some really pathetic story and even more dreadful screenplay. The only innovation or change(as you would say) is that they don't forget to play with some numbers... i.e.. 1.....2.....and now a sick and forgettable ...3.Raaz 3 written by Shagufta Rafique, who has constantly been an ardent team member for Mahesh and Vikram Bhatt and who also wrote Raaz(2002), messed it up this one..... Big time.With Raaz 3, we see the leading lady of the original Raaz(2002), Bipasha Basu making her re-appearance. Bipasha dawns the character of a top actress whose only ambition in her life is to win the 'Best Actress' award. Well to tell you, she is a pro in her field of work... according to Mr. Rafique (The Writer).But folks, how can you even think that she can fulfill her dreams so easily. Enters, Esha Gupta(Jannat 2), the new bollywood and this time, in the movie too. She swept away the award for which Bipasha was rooting for so Long........ BOOM.....And here kick starts your movie.... Raazzzzzz 3.Bipasha later takes the help of black magic to ruin Esha's success and happiness and to regain for herself the lost glory. In between this magical Cat fight is stuck up our country's official 'serial kisser' , Mr. Hashmi, who was genuinely improving as an actor till the time he was away from the Bhatt camp. For Emraan you can just feel pity and nothing else. You can find him running behind Bipasha, Esha and the comical ghost at frequent intervals. Ohh Man... what more I can say.. huh.The rest of the movie is a severe pain in the head as its a "3D"...... yes its a "3D". It's becoming an irritating trend in bollywood to make or release movies in 3D, just to add up more number of audience.After a long list of previously "3D" titled movies, which were just edited in 3D, Raaz 3 actually is one of the movies that has been completely shot in 3D rather than just being edited in. Inspite of that fact the '3D sense' of the movie does not even slightly appear as any different from the pack of existing failures. A Big disappointment.The Bhatt's are constantly using up their old titles and mixing them with numbers. Murder 1, 2...Jannat 1, 2....Jism 1, 2... and now Raaz 1,2 and 3. If you ask me frankly Raaz 3 seriously does not offer anything new or anything out of the box.., well it doesn't even try to.Be it dialogs, moments , all are stereotypical. "Contains Spoilers" For e.g.. A doctor yammering up "Mere 15 saal kay profession men Maine aisa case kabhi nahi dekha." Well Mr. Doc I am sorry for you because for past more than 20 years, all horror genuinely release bollywood movies have this same dialog by every doctor.Take 10 kilos of crap and put on one side of the weighing machine's plate. Now, even if you write 'Raaz 3' on the other plate of the machine your 10 kilos of crap will shoot up. The movie is that heavy and premium quality of crap. I'm sure Vikram and Mahesh Bhatt had worked hard to build this piece of nonsense.If you are planning to watch Raaz 3 in a theater then I strongly advice you to donate that money to the poor and needy. If you want to rent a CD...its a NO. If you want to download it, then, well, I can't stop you.. but there is no Anti-Virus in the market at present that can prevent your system being infected from the crap that will be spread by this "immensely degraded" movie.Raaz 3 all in all is a Poor movie by all or any standards. Stay at home and have look at Bipasha Basu's picture on the internet with face close-up.. and there you have watched your Raaz 3." 
" Very dumb movie","This is movie is a dumb effort to continue the RAAZ legacy. one of the most stupid movies of all times. The story is okay. Direction is cheap. Cast has acted dumb - all three of them. The extras are funny! The music is bad and so is the background music. If you watch the movie you will understand what I am talking about. I will not recommend this movie at all.I also want Vikram Bhatt to stop making horror movies for the sake of making one.If u really want to watch RAAZ, watch RAAZ 1." 
" Raaz-3...a time pass movie","Why would you want to see Raaz-3? Well, here are the reasons‚Äî 1.If you are a horror fan then it may give you quite a good deal of enjoyment.Though the movie is not that much scary, but still worth watching.2. There are some steamy hot scenes in the movie. Emraan Hashmi did some hot romantic scenes with both Bipasha Basu and Esha Gupta. Specially the scenes between Hashmi & Bipasha (both romantic & conflict) were very enjoyable.3. Emraan did a decent job while Bipasha just crossed her previous performances with this negative role; Esha did okay job for her second film; overall all the actors did a decent acting job.4. However, there are some drawbacks in the movie‚Äîlike clich√© dialogues, predictable finishing and moral conflict of Hashmi which has become a common phenomenon at his films nowadays. Moreover, the film gets a bit slow after the second half. The audience should not try to find much logic in this film.It's a time pass movie; one can enjoy Raaz 3 if he just wants to chill for some time." 
" I liked it, though the horror quotient was not that much as in the first one , but still it was scary and hats off to Bipasha","7/10 I liked the movie, The story is somewhat like an actress who is losing her fame now wants to take revenge with a new shining actress using black magic. Bipasha was brilliant, Emraan was good too but over shadowed by Bipss and Esha Gupta was OK OK. Story was good, Though the amount of horror scenes were a little less than i expected, but still those scenes that the movie has were really good.... Especially the scene where esha is surrounded by cockroaches, and a scene where her maid kills her self, these all scenes are really good... Vikram Bhatt has mastered this genre... The movie is worth a watch and better for 3D." 
" Sell your soul to devil",""Raaz 3" cleverly utilises the success of the franchise and ropes in from the original the director Vikram Bhatt and actress Bipasha Basu (thank God, Dino Morea was permitted to stay away!). Writer Shagufta Ali fences the plot quite well - a waning actress who can go any lengths to retain the crowning glory and succumbs to making use of black magic as a weapon of destruction. Bipasha gives her best shot however appears she was over-doing it and if I may dare say flaunting her body she has toned over the unemployment years. Emraan Hashmi's character is not well etched out. Eesha Gupta manages a decent performance considering she is a newbie in comparison. And yes, Bipasha & Shagufta as half-sisters - bad writing. Songs are OK carrying the signature Mahesh Bhatt feel. Director Vikram Bhatt who has developed core competence in the genre of horror does a decent job. On that note, the writer could have polished the edges to give that sheen it warranted." 
" Old wine in new bottle","Horror films had become extinct in Bollywood, but RAAZ(2002) brought the trend in again and the film was a hit and it also gave a filip to that time 1 film old Bipasha Basu who got tremendous acclaim though her voice was dubbed. Years passed Vikram Bhatt the once lucky mascot of Bhatts with 3 back to back hits(Ghulam, Kasoor and Raaz) went to make films for others and for Bhatts he gave 2 disasters FOOTPATH(2003) and Inteha(2003) and it was pack up time for Vikram Bhatt, even otherwise his films were flopping, he came back with horror films like 1920, Shaapit, Haunted 3D.etc and got another disaster Dangerous Ishq(2012). Bipasha too started doing films for other filmmakers and after some time her career started flagging. RAAZ 3 is the third installment of Raaz after the average Raaz TMC(2009) Surprisingly Emraan was an AD for RAAZ and he starred in RAAZ TMC and now comes back in Raaz 3. It seems like Bhatts want to bring in the old formula of Ghosts, with Black Magic and all other stuff we thought had disappeared from Bollywood after RGV reinvented Ghost films with Bhoot(2003) The film also tries to mix in a lot more, there is plenty of eroticism, plenty of Humanism stories, Jealousy and lot of god vs evil. The film also copies from everywhere. The film has several moments which thrill while many make you die laughing. The film starts off well, in flashback(some trend of sorts recently) and then we are shown that Bips is awaiting her best actress award, but it goes to Esha Gupta. I didn't ever know that a director after winning best director will give the award directly to best actress, lol but then it also seems like there are 2 actresses only in Bollywood. Anywayz in such films logic be damned. As usual black magic is introduced in a funny creepy like Satan(Manish Chaudhary with lots of Kohl) who stays in a bhasti, he chants some thing and he gives Bips some water to give to Esha. So Bips seduces Emraan Hashmi and gets him do the job for her. He agrees(for some reason not explained) and what follows is several typical Bhatt style horror elements like the joker, windows opening on their own, while some are truly scary at times and the 3D is well used as per Indian standards though at times overused. The main story is sort of predictable but there are some scenes well handled like the scene when cockroaches attack Esha, Emraan confronting Bips at interval, The maid attacking Sanjana, The scene at the graveyard There are some unintentionally hilarious scenes like Emraan controlling Esha by kissing her, the ghost phoning Bipasha, The Satan demanding sex.etc Some scenes are never explained like why does the devil suddenly change his style when he could kill the maid why not kill Esha? Why does Emraan support Bipasha? The climax is well executed though it does look gimmicky Direction by Vikram Bhatt is decent, he reuses all his previous formula Music is typical Bhatt style, some songs are good like the title song, Deewana Kar Raha Hai, Rafta Rafta Camera-work is good, Dialogues are good at places with liberal use of abusive language.Bipasha Basu returns after a long time in a pivotal role and does an extreme good job, she excels in her role Emraan Hashmi does his routine Bhatt films act though he does a good job esp at the interval and he shows his growth, the role doesn't really demand much from him after proving his expertise with Shanghai his role is typical in Bhatt films(minus the streetsmart act) yet he does give a restrained performance which Dino had failed in Raaz Esha Gupta does seem plastic in her second outing(Jannat 2) though she does well in the cockroach scene yet she has a long way to go Manish Chaudhary, a regular of Bhatt camp does a good job" 
" best ever","I feel sorry for people who think this was rubbish.. they are comparing this to Hollywood who have all the money to use on realistic graphics. this is one of the first Bollywood movies i like as it had a very good story with some good acting from Emran. however Bipasha's performance was outstanding. her performance blew me away, and because of her performance i didn't care about the faults. also please watch this movie in 3d as it will have a great affect on you... p.s. some of the clips gave me goosebumps as when i watch a movie i am able to eat all my popcorn but i couldn't eat watching this, as my eyes were glued to the screen. so overall this movie has some faults but her acting and the story made up for it massively!!!!!! Solid 8/10 Also this is just my opinion but i think you should at least watch the movie to make your own verdict as my verdict was that this film was better then a lot of Hollywood horror movies!!!!" 
" Watch it for fun,not to be scared","It definitely has to start with Bipasha Basu,the SHOW STEALER of the movie. Bipasha Basu is both hero and a villain in the movie.She left no stones unturned if you look into her acting talents. With portraying the struggle of an actor's life to attain fame and success,Bipasha is in her best shoes this time. She caught the character in a very apt and accurate manner.With script being weightless and the horror scenes looking funny or to laugh at,the movie on a whole is not one to be scared of. Sanjana(Esha Gupta) is very average.Though looking beautiful in most of the scenes she has to work really hard on her acting and dancing skills. Emraan this time got to be in good terms with both the actresses(kissing scenes!!)definitely,he has done justice to his role but again Bips has overshadowed him in almost every term due her profound expression, psyche behavior and arrogance . Well plotted, really! The movie is an amalgam of vendetta, jealousy, conflict, drama and sexuality.With showcasing the staunch Indian beliefs about black magic and all again our young generation need logic behind everything which this movie lacks a lot.The so-called famous cockroach scene enacted by Esha did not have a goosebumps effect either.So watch it for fun,not to be scared.~ Sheetal Sharma for ratemovieshere.com" 
" definitely a time waster..","I totally am regretting about the time I have spent to watch this film. I really loved the first film of "Raaz" series. It was fantastic horror/romance film and based on it's awesomeness (I was unable to watch the 2nd one; so I don't have any idea about it.) I watched this one. Well it was a total mistake. It not even remotely as good as the first one. It meant to be a horror film but nothing in the film even remotely scared me but bored me to dead.I don't blame Bipasha (the leading actress) and the leading actor. They were doing a good job and were doing justice to their characters. The script is so poor though. And also those stunts.The evil character is a real joke. It made me laugh instead of making me scary. It was a really poor effort. I am not telling these guys to be as good as Hollywood guys who has better conveniences and a bigger market. Yet Bollywood making blockbusters as good as Hollywood films. But this film had not even tried to come closer to those films.There is an extended scene of nudity in this film and it is a good one and looks more realistic. So that means that these guys has talents but were not trying to use it. The thing is that some nudity alone cannot make a good one. It is only a decoration.I will definitely watch if there is another episode of this movie with the hope for lots of improvements. Raaz series shouldn't dye; instead it should rise to its former glory and should go beyond that point." 
" Good idea went terrible","The movie as an idea and perhaps on paper was good for a Bollywood film for a change. but the execution was terrible and made the film into a cheesy flick. Here are some points that could make this film way better if were done: 1- The woman meets a ghost for black magic??? It would have been way better if this was another human expert in the black magic or at least the director did not reveal immediately that the man was a ghost. It took way a lot from the suspense.2- What are the stupid songs doing in this kind of film? OK you want to add songs why not creepy slow songs to build up the movie rather than make it more cheesy than it is with BAD songs just to show the skin of the girls. 3- A man's head is chopped in the graveyard and immediately we see a song!! How can a director call himself a decent one and does not understand the basics of directing and suspense building?4- The film is written all over it "CHEESY". It is worse than D or Z grade Hollywoood flicks. They are showing the Ghost or the entity as Freddy Krueger from The Nightmare on Elm Street which takes all the frights. A good director would have showed less. In horror movies always the less you show the more creepy a movie will be. A good example I would say something like Rosemary's Baby. I feel that entity or ghost should have been shown the way the evil force was shown in The Exorcism of Emily Rose where the evil appeared to Laura Lenny's character with a cape without showing anything else or its face. That itself was very terrifying. 5- The maid was killed by the entity and Emran saw it too. Black magic effects are supposed to be seen by the one who has its spell casted on and not by everybody!! Why Bollywood directors love to mix everything all together? can you have a milkshake, ornage juice and a cola mixed together for a drink. I really don't understand6- Performance wise, even the best Hollywood films rarely you see a good perofrmance in that genre so nothing expected. I felt the main character Bipasha Basu was missing from the film!! Yea didn't feel any significance in her presence, the director could not use her. Emran Hashmi was just a puppet, again boring and the girl who played Sanjana was extremely irritating to watch. Both Bipasha and Emran have better roles in other movies.Unforutunately Raaz 3 is a movie deserved to fail but succeeded at the box office in 2012 along with other crappy films like Barfi and Kahaani and is yet another proof that Bollywood if at least not going backward is not moving at all.So far almost all the Bollywood films I have watched for 2012 can be termed the least as "BAD" with the only exception being Sridevi's English Vinglish." 
" oh my god","I feel sorry for people who think this was rubbish.. they are comparing this to Hollywood who have all the money to use on realistic graphics. this is one of the first Bollywood movies i like as it had a very good story with some good acting from Emran. however Bipasha's performance was outstanding. her performance blew me away, and because of her performance i didn't care about the faults. also please watch this movie in 3d as it will have a great affect on you... p.s. some of the clips gave me goosebumps as when i watch a movie i am able to eat all my popcorn but i couldn't eat watching this, as my eyes were glued to the screen. so overall this movie has some faults but her acting and the story made up for it massively!!!!!! Solid 8/10 Also this is just my opinion but i think you should at least watch the movie to make your own verdict as my verdict was that this film was better then a lot of Hollywood horror movies!!!!" 
" In all the raaz franchise the one which I don't like that much is this one.A little bad compared to their other parts","All the parts of raaz franchise is good only this one is a little bad compared to their other parts.The problem is that that the story is a lil slow.The horror scenes were not that much as I have expected.But the direction was really good from Vikram Bhatt.The movie is OK The acting from Emraan was good as expected.Bipasha and Esha Gupta acted good.The songs were really beautiful and pleasant to hear loves the songs.And not only in this part the songs are good and beautiful in all the parts.The dialogues were OK.Overall if you are very bored then go for this.Surely a one time watch." 
" Terrible, Awful, Do Not Watch It!!","I love Emran Hashmi and his work, his movies are more realistic and make more sense compare to other Bollywood masala nonsense. After reading bad reviews for this movie, I still decided to take a chance and I made a mistake. Bipasha did terrible work, she overact in every sex scene (very bad acting). Esha Gupta needs to stay out of Bollywood as they already got so many bad actresses. Vikram Bhatt did unbelievably low class job, it seems more like B grade type of movie. Roach scene was so fake that you could easily see graphical work errors and I did not understand that why Sanjana (Esha) did not run out of bathroom immediately. My eight years old nephew can write better dialogues. The only thing made sense was jealousy nothing else e.g. world of souls, non existing chemistry between Aditya (Emran) and Sanjana (Esha), sisterhood blah blah blahDon't Don't Don't WATCH IT !!!!!!!!!" 
" Raaz.....The Junk Secret in 3D","Vikram Bhat's "Raaz" was one of the best thriller Hindi movies, but the latest offering is a voodoo gone bad (The 16th Franchise will have Bipashu practicing Feng Shui?) and in 3D..or three times bad. The hero is a chubby cheeked midget who is slovenly boring and imbecilic. His acting is mostly staring into space and exposing what used to be his biceps. Pity the heroines who have to kiss a goat. Since when? a clown singing happy birth-day is a horror segment in a movie may I ask? Bipashu (a clever mix of Bipasha and Basu)is in fading as an actress for this franchize. She does not command the screen as she used to and she better leave the heaving and the heavy breathing to Sunny Leone. Shouldn't her gripe and black magic be more against Sunny instead of Sanjana! The direction by Bhat is corny and appeals to the astute Six-Year old moviegoer sitting on an adult lap. The story is ridiculous and vehemently put together to accommodate the wanna-be actors that are picked from the men doing dirty laundry at dhobi ghat. They must have auditioned for Bhatts, ever since they were given permission to churn out movies. The horror in the movie seems to be more in the making than the content."
