" Not worth a watch!.... Definitely NOT worth a watch!!!","To watch or not to watch that is the eternal question.....well i have the answer with this movie....DEFINITELY not to watch!Overall this is a below average movie with poor acting and shoddy script. Having seen the movie i definitely can not recommend the film.I had considered a Manoj Bajpai to be a decent actor from the little bit i had seen of him(i.e i thought he was pretty in Road) and i thought he was a character actor. But i was proved other wises in this movie and hopefully he offers better performances in the future.Summation: Below average film with a average plot and below average cast & acting! 4/10" 
" If you make copies from English movies....try to deliver a fair deal","Absolute Cheap copy of the BASIC INSTINCT. Isha Koppikar was such a good actress and here too she tries to deliver a smooth piece of seductive hot image with a vicious personality as a killer. But apparently she fails to even come close to the performance delivered by Sharon Stone. Like say the interrogation room scene from both the movies. Manoj Bajpai although disappoints the most as we never expected such a lame movie from his banner. The entire movie is almost predictable. Some plots, here and there are not the same as the English movie. Songs are mostly bullshit. Its painful to see good actors, like the leads in this movie, to land up in once or a while shitty roles like these. It may click some movie halls in the sub-urban crowd for the so called steamy scenes which too were very hardly seen. Anyways, any sensible person who hasn't watched the English epic will rate it not more than 4/10."
