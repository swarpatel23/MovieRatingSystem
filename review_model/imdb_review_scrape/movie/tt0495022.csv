" Not great but a decent one-time watch","I went to watch Ankahee with zero expectations. Vikram Bhatt is a director who hardly ever did a good film, and barring a few exceptions, most of his films are poor and unoriginal. But somehow I found Ankahee watchable despite the poor writing. The film deals with such issues as adultery and depression, and it might not be convincing, but somewhat enjoyable. Esha Deol stars as a beauty pageant who has an affair with a married man played by Aftab Shivdasani. First, with all due respect, Deol is far from having the looks of a beauty pageant. In fact, she is not half as beautiful as her mother Hema Malini. Having said that, she performed passionately throughout the film and her wide eyes conveyed the emptiness and the frustration of a woman suffering from manic depression. Aftab Shivdasani was decent as the confused man who lacks character. Amisha Patel was convincing and played the wronged but strong wife with sincerity and depth. This may be her most (or should I say only) solid performance since Gaddar. Technically, Ankahee is well-made. The story was quite good and the proceedings were dark and serious, albeit a bit confused and slow. The ending is strange and funny, but nevertheless, this is a decent fare which can be watched with family and friends." 
" I wish this review could have been ankahee. (wish i hadn't seen it)","I was dragged into this movie by my mom and sister and i expected total C*&p and let me tell you i got exactly that.Having a positive attitude i will list only 3 atrocities this movie has committed(if i list all ill need a few days emotional support) and then focus on the good parts:-1) The movie had absolutely the most horrible cast in recent years. Aftab Shivdasani looked young out of place and displayed no acting talent his range of facial expressions and emotions consisted of two looks both of which were similar to confused and can be best described as disaster. His chemistry with the actresses was as bad as can get and was non existent. Esha Deol looked bad and struggled to play her role her acting talent is not far behind Aftab's and in certain scenes she almost scared us with her hideous makeup and facial expressions. Amisha Patel who I'm sure did this role because she is Vikram bhatts new girlfriend again looked completely out of place and looked straight out off Ekta Kapoors serial with here coloured hair, saree and mangalsutra(gimme a break). 2)The story held some promise but instead the Vikram only concentrated on one stupid scene to the other making sure it looks like he is the sufferer while the other woman is the culprit. He excessively demonizes the character ( who i believe is based on Sushmita Sen) and forgets that there i story. The movie offers no explanation for the events that unfold especially disturbing is that we are yet not aware why Aftab fell for Esha in the first place.3) The songs are lack lustre and as usual serve as further torture in this long and boring movie. The ample time one gets is more than enough to focus on the other bad parts about the movie. For instance how the hell did Esha still be alive and kicking a few hours after she swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills. What kind of doctor is Aftab anyway..why the hell did he fall for Esha in the first placemust stop, must not type more.why is that AFTAB A VETERAN OF OVER TEN FILMS HAVE TO BE DUBBED BY SOMEONE WHO SOUNDS LIKE VIKRAM BHATT (what kind of actor is dubbed in his tenth film)must be strong must stop complaining..As promised now for the good parts (yes there are a few):- 1)The trauma that the child from the broken family goes through though over exaggerated actually makes you feel for the children of broken families especially when one of the parents has had a much publicised affair. 2) There is a scene in the movie where the long corridor effectively captures the distance in the relation between the 2 people and that they are about to split. 3) There are actually nearly 2 dialogues that I liked in this movie which I hope will appear in the quotes section soon.All this occupies 5 minutes of the movie so nows the ONLY REASON one my watch this movie:- If you are the gossip and scandal loving person who is filled by a burning curiosity to learn Vikram Bhatt's version of his affair with Sushmita Sen and how she is actually supposed to be suicidal, alone , insecure etc etc then this movie will more then give you enough scoop. The signs are all there the Miss World, the large diamond ring she always wore, the famous Sushmita victory photo, the hair etc etc. This seems to be the only reason this movie was made .The only other reason would be if someone dragged you along like I was or a large sum of money.All in a pathetic movie that provides no entertainment except to a narrow section of society.Ps I just heard that due to the negative reactions from audiences and film fraternity alike Vikram Bhatt is now claiming that this movie is in fact not about Sushmita. Too late Mr. Bhatt..so Sushmita used to cut her wrists you sayhmmm" 
" Terrific Thriller with an Amazing Story","It has to be Vikram Bhatt's best film, Aftab's & Esha's acting was excellent. I felt really sorry for Esha although she was dangerous & obsessive especially when she was crying in the hospital. The story is about Aftab who is a doctor and is happy with his married life with Amista Patel but unfortunately an actress & miss world came into his hospital after a failed suicide attempt. Aftab was taking care of her and told the media "It was just an accident". Eventually they both fell in love with each other and that's where they all start to have major problems. The film contains every emotion, its low budget and music is very heartfelt." 
" Vikram Bhatt goes Mahesh Bhatt way","Mahesh Bhatt has made several autobiographical films, right from ARTH, PHIR TERI KAHAANI YAAD AAYI, ZAKHM(based on his mother's story). Vikram Bhatt too follows his path in this film and makes ANKAHEE supposedly based on his affair with Sushmita Sen, but not sure how far it's true, also he refuted claims when the film released. The film has a plot which has been seen many times, actually the plot is similar to ARTH with daughter track added, Vikram Bhatt does handle several scenes well, however some scenes look too primitive. The film also gets predictable after a time but yet it's quite a decent watchDirection is good Music is decent, Tumse Yun Milenge which is sung by Kunal Ganjawala(also a video is shown in the opening credits featuring him which was a trend those days)is good, Ek Pal too is good rest are okayAftab Shivdasani does a good job, this marked a comeback with Vikram Bhatt for him after Kasoor,Awara Paagal Deewana, Footpath.etc surprisingly even his voice is dubbed by Vikram Bhatt for reasons unknown Esha does a superb job in her role sadly her career never took off Ameesha Patel too gives a decent performance after ages, her career too never took off and she got releagated to doing second fiddle roles. Amin Hajee is good, Ashwini Kalsekar is superb as always, Hrishita Bhatt has a cameo and she is okay rest are okay" 
" My humble Review","I usually don't like a lot of movies but I think this one was different. I liked Ankahee, however like most Indian movies this one a bit to long. The problem is in the fact that this is a story about depression and since that is a very taboo subject with most human beings it should be conveyed in a more direct and brief manner. That being said I must say I dated a girl who was pretty close to the mental state of Esha Deol's in the movie. From a first hand experience I must say this movie portrays the depression factor very realistically. The paranoia, the violence, the arguing for no apparent reason.. its all there and very very true.To comment some of the things said by dudeshwar(on the main page):2: Aftab looked like a sufferer alright but not someone who would get a a lot of sympathy vote since the mess was created by himself. He actually looks as bad as Esha.3: Why the hell would he fall for Esha Deol ? Well she is Miss World(in the movie). Hence She is beautiful and in need of help, He's a doctor so he usually helping anybody in need of it. Its obvious why he fell for her.But anyways am I the only One who thought this movie was well and directed and pretty realistic.??????" 
" Yawn for the first half, Predictable in the second","Yes, the title stands true. I watched this movie with friends. One of them watched till half-time, and went back to catch up on sleep. The rest of us stayed on. It was painfully slow from around 15%th to the 50%th point. Long dialogue sequences. Overacting. And the most annoying thing -- Aftab's inability to converse (especially arguments) without moving this hands in air as in sword-fighting. If he had a sword in his hands, he'd have cut both Ameesha Patel and Esha into million pieces each.The second half was a respite. Story picked up pace. But now it went into the well-beaten track of Bollywood (won't reveal that in the review, but it's obvious from film's theme). Very much predictable.Positives: 1. Ameesha Patel looked nice. 2. The movie starts off with an old-age Aftab lying in bed. The portrayal is funny. All us friends went into a laughter spree.Negatives: 1. Oft-repeated theme. Too predictable. 2. Aftab's lack of dialogue-delivery abilities. 3. Esha looked horrible in most parts of the movie." 
" A Great Movie","I am an avid movie watcher but I watch very selective movies, I think Ankahee was a great movie. On one hand it portrays the problems a single woman faces immediately after she splits with her husband.. her insecurities, her commitments. everything is brought about fantastically in the movie. The scene in which Ameesha takes a three wheeler in the wee hours of the morning to get a job when her husband legally severs the relationship is very brilliantly portrayed.On the other hand Esha too suffers a lot; she is however shown as a very intelligent person who predicts every reaction of Aftab. All psychosomatic diseases happen to over-intelligent people and to that extent the director is brilliant. I think it is a realistic and a very well shot movie with Aftab always having undertones of guilt which is very evident when he does not smile completely for a particular photograph which Esha wishes to take. Esha's acting too is very praise worthy.Whether the film did well or not at the box-office ,I think the film deserves full rating." 
" Fantastic!","I would definitely go to say that Ankahee has been the most undervalued film of 2006. Like other recent, excellent movies coming from the Bhatt camp (such as Kalyug and Gangster), Ankahee is an intense story that deals with all the dark human emotions such as guilt, jealousy, depression, greed, temptation, fear, obsession, loneliness, etc. bringing out the good and bad of every character. Because this movie is loosely based on a true story (of Vikram Bhatt and Sushmita Sen), the entire plot and character developments make perfect sense. For example, I have read a little bit about manic depression recently. Esha's behavior, along with the psychologist's explanation of it, is very logical. The only thing I didn't like, however, is that Esha's character is portrayed negatively towards the end. What I love the absolute most about this movie is how beautifully it captures the emotions of a betrayed wife and child. Amisha desperately tries hard to protect her home by pleasing her husband and even begging Esha. I love the quote where she admits she doesn't have the strength to fight her divorce case as her fight to save her home was a failure. However, at the same time she admirably maintains her self-respect and dignity by demanding an explanation from Aftab and rejecting him after he comes back regretful for divorcing his wife and neglecting his family. Hrishitta's character is also very well portrayed as it shows her confusion, innocence, sympathy, hurt, and anger. All the characters and plot are excellently developed, and the cast acted wonderfully. These are both Amisha and Esha's best performances after numerous unimpressive attempts in their previous films. Both are terrific! Songs are beautiful. Pritam, also highly undervalued, is a genius composer." 
" surprisingly not a disappointment!!!","Well the movie seemed boring and dragged at times but it sure is not a total disappointment. I am not proud to say but I was stunned by Esha Deol's work in the movie. She is sure to be nominated for the best actress in negative role award for this year and if I was to decide, ill even give her one. Aftab and Amisha were also not as bad as they usually are. There are few good scenes in the movie and some powerful dialogues make up for the rest of the score I have given the movie. I would agree that it is not that great a movie but it definitely is under-rated. I would recommend watching the movie at least once if u do have the time. Obviously it is not a 'watch again' movie and maybe for some of you, not even worth watching in the cinema halls either, but renting it's VCD on a Saturday afternoon is surely not a bad idea." 
" A sensitive film.....","Ankahee is a simple story about infidelity revolving a beauty queen ,a doctor and a house wife.Vikram Bhatt undoubtedly proved that he can make sensitive films that can be appreciated by viewers that go for more than just dumb entertainment in a film.Esha Deol truly shines in the film.She definitely deserves at least an award for her exceptional performance in the film.She manages to create so much of hatred but also pity from the audience.She brigthens up every scene she is in.Aftab also is commendable in the film.Amisha Patel shocks you with a composed but striking performance as the vulnerable housewife.The music by Pritam and the lyrics are just wonderful!!! This films are one of those films that do not get much appreciation that it deserves.On the whole,Ankahee is a film that should be watched only by people who can appreciate sensitivity and realism in films." 
" Enjoyable","I was quite surprised by how much I really enjoyed this movie. Don't get me wrong, there were some cringe-worthy moments (Dr Shekar crying in his car towards the end of the movie) but overall a very enjoyable movie. I sat till the end without forwarding some bits. Esha was awesome, I thought. Knowing a manic depressive person, I was really impressed by the way she portrayed her character's unreasonable outbursts and insecurities, and then to switch from a screaming banshee to a teary eyed helpless female in the blink of an eye, was so real it was scary. Aftab tried, and as someone said earlier, he was better in this than in some of his movies, although not great. somehow he failed to convince me of his GREAT love for Esha or why he fell for her so hard. Instead he got off as a snivelling spineless man who didn't even seem like he was sure of his love for her. It seemed to me that he felt more pity for her than any great passion. If anything, he deserved everything he got in the end. Amisha Patel was also surprisingly watchable as opposed to her other movies. For once we were all spared her shrill, now-I'm-angry, voice (except for one scene). She played the wronged, yet dignified about it, wife very well and was really the only character (and the child) whom I felt sorry for. And I was quite glad when she closed the door in his face when he went crawling back. All in all a very watchable and enjoyable movie, that I could, and did buy and watched twice over"
