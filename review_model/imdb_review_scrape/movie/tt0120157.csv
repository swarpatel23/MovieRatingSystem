" Soldier on!","Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action-thriller from Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Set on a garbage-dump planet, Soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell barely speaking as the title character, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for dead. The supporting cast of colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute Michael Chiklis, is able. They spend most of the movie being scared of Russell, and the rest of it running for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given. With almost no words to say, he conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and glances. It is almost a mime performance. When the action sequences kick into gear, he kicks ass--and does so in a strong, silent, matter-of fact way. There are flaws. Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs does a great impression of Frank Burns from M*A*S*H as a weaselly commanding officer, and Gary Busey busts a gut (and nearly busts his girdle) as Todd's mentor. This is an underrated, and excellent sci-fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of Blade Runner--David Webb Peoples wrote both screenplays." 
" Somber Tale Of A Possible Future","In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. They are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever.  This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `Soldier,' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell.  The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from   preadolescence to adulthood.  Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier.  But even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite.  A new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete.  What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life:  Fear and discipline. 	Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts.  He has few lines in this movie, but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes.  This role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before.  And he's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype.  Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen (Sandra) and Jason Isaacs (Colonel Mekum).  Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee, memorable as Caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; Sean Pertwee (Mace); Gary Busey (Captain Church); Michael Chiklis (Jimmy Pig); and Mark Bringleson (Rubrick). 	Anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction.  `Soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact.  It's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference.  Much like `1984,' and `Mad Max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share.  I rate this one 7/10." 
" Well, I liked it","OK, so Soldier isn't deep and meaningful like Blade Runner or as big budget as Terminator 2 but on the whole I found it quite enjoyable.The fact that Kurt Russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant. I found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than Arnie's in the T films (and before I get comments yes I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same).So to the film itself, a reasonable US/Brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other.Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci-Fi lineage. And the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly.If you see this on your TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance. I don't think you will be disappointed." 
" What did you expect?","Soldier isn't a great movie, and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons. But I liked Soldier alot, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me.First, the art direction is tight and well executed. As far as science fiction backdrops go, Soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre. The sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; I didn't love all of their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. For me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films. Soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It's not an award winning role, but Kurt musters up convincing emotion with VERY little dialog.Third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. This isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.If you haven't seen it, and you like sci-fi action films, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice. Just don't expect the next Bladerunner." 
" An action Sci-Fi movie with something more than one liners to say","I don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here. I only saw it when it came onto cable. The film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines. Specifically one person, the way he gets replaced and dumped (literally) into an off-world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels.Seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be Rambo in space, and would have been happy if it was.I'm certainly happy it was'nt - Kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple. The scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment.This is not a classic SF movie in the way that Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, Logan's run or THX1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest I've seen to it in a long time.He changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack Arnie one liners, he does'nt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy ending.That's why this film did'nt do well. It did'nt follow formula, and among a 18-25 year old target American audience, that's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see.Fear and discipline.Always." 
" A good movie in two parts","The first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts: the -thematic- conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, and the -physical- conflict between Todd and his bio-engineered replacement. Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways.Peoples' screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half-way through the movie, which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp.Nonetheless, kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to Kurt Russell who conveys much with very little.Not a great film, but one worth seeing." 
" A strange mix...","David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson...if it already sounds weird to you, then you are right, because it is.Peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc... He covered these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines.Paul Anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller. Not surprisingly so have all of his other movies! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications!Peoples' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie. Soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill, and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better, genetically engineered soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left for dead. There he must cope with a group of refugees, some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here. BUT THEN......The bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. Big, violent, loud action ensues and Peoples' script turns into an Anderson action-fest. It is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way, but the end product is better then I expected. Entertaining, somewhat, though admittedly not very, thought-provoking, and exciting once the action starts. 7/10Rated R: a lot of violence" 
" Russell kicks ass. Terrific fun.","Before poor Paul W.S. Anderson made a fatal misstep with Alien Vs. Predator and was maligned, he made a few really excellent genre flicks back in the mid to late 90's, one of them being the mostly forgotten and excessively fun Soldier, starring a mostly mute and wholly badass Kurt Russell as a genetically bred super soldier who has fallen on hard times. His name is Todd 3465, and he's from the last line of soldiers who are in fact real humans, albeit altered. There's a new program moving in, wherein actual replicants are produced, rendering Todd obsolete. The head of the new outfit is sadistic Colonel Mekum (Jason Isaacs in full evil prick mode), who wants to do away with anything that isn't state of the art. Todd is thrashed in a one on one smackdown with Mekum's lead soldier (Jason Scott Lee), and then left to die on a remote planet used only for trash disposal and inhabited by wayward crash survivors who scavenge what they can. Todd is immediately the outsider, an unfeeling asset bred only for combat and alien to human qualities. A few among the group, including their leader Mace (Anderson regular Sean Pertwee) and Jimmy Pig (Michael Chicklis) attempt to connect, but it's gorgeous Connie Nielsen who finally breaks the ice. He may be conditioned to kill, but he's still a human man after all, and there's some base instincts you just can't ignore. Trouble brews when Mekum shows up again, that bastard. Now he wants to vaporize their planet on the grounds that the refugees are essentially squatting. Undermining him is Todd's former boss Church (an unusually restrained Gary Busey), an honorable military veteran who'd love to put Mekum six feet under and restore order. Todd must help his newfound friends, fight tooth and nail against replicants and win his superiority back. Russell is a tank in the role, letting both silence and action speak volumes, a one man old school ass kicking hero of the highest order. The world building and outer space effects are incredibly fun, the villains are broadly characterized with the force of a western, and the whole film knows what people want for a good time at the cinema. Oohh and fun fact: this takes place in the same cinematic universe as Blade Runner, and you can listen for the brief tie in reference that only die hards will pick up on. Great stuff." 
" Avoids many clichés, very well directed, very well acted.","Ok, basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence. You can count about 10 clichés that the film is building up to, but it only delivers on about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot. Kurt Russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding. Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!" 
" Reference to Blade runner","In the movie several references are made in subtly to Blade runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact the Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs, breed to be expendable warriors. But as favorite quote of mine from the movie is, " you should have made them smart as well as fast". Kurt Russell did a incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined. Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his shuddering when he is given a hug, and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded Todd of himself, and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier." 
" They said it was bad I watched it and loved it","When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie.  Instead I thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating.  And you know what it worked. Kurt Russel did what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was.  I recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film." 
" Great work, Russell!","I watched this movie expecting what I got: good sci-fi cowboy stuff.  What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role.Imagine trying to act under these two restraints:  you have hardly any dialogue, and because you are playing a hardass, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions!  Howzat?  Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped.  In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed, Russell pulls off an incredible characterization.  His robot becomes human, in spite of the constraints.  Great job!As usual, Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered.  Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly, and gorgeous.  I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take one's eyes off her.  Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited.  Much of the plot is quite standard, with a fair amount of weaknesses, but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling, I don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses.  By the end of the story the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. Yes!The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point." 
" A seemingly simple movie written on a number of levels","Nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci-fi movie that's been vilified at the US box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell's career.I have my reasons.Firstly when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the eponymous Soldier. I'm going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I've seen Russell pull off. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense PTSD - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.The portrayal is spot on. Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner. He suffers from irrational anxiety - keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger. His hyper-focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within - there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed, not cleaning up the cut or the blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote - not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later.Todd's dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence. Fear and Discipline we are told. Always. Fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by, keeping him ready to react on a knife edge. Discipline to hold him in check through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically. The inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen's Sandra - but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted - Fear and Discipline indeed.Then there is the subtext of his abandonment (Twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in OUR world, in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly picks up the mantle of Mace's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission, even one with such a high likelihood of his death.Then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between Busey's Church and the hotshot from HQ, Mekum. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. Any one of them could pound Todd into the ground - but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them. An incentivized Todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance. It is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership.There are many other subtle themes. When a film is shot and scripted so minimally, it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root. Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches YOU." 
" One of the best action films of all time ... and yet still ignored","Kurt Russell was in his late 40s when director Paul Anderson put together this gem. He had started his career with Disney and had a pretty good run over the years, in a wide variety of parts (including Elvis, not kidding you). His most memorable part however was the character of hard man Snake Plessken in the two Escape films, the second much worse than the first, and the first notable mainly for Russell. And then comes this gem. Boy does this guy deliver. Not just the action scenes, but -- in the great tradition of Universal Soldier which, arguably, this copies from -- in the acting as well. You look in his face and you feel the pain of being betrayed by the government. The story is superb in that it builds. In other reviews I have explained the mysterious secret of action movies, ie, that the brain of the viewer yearns for logic and order. If you deliver fight scenes that have each new fight based on the result of the last one, you increase viewer satisfaction. Here viewer satisfaction goes off the chart. Nice riffs and children and violence, opposites attract, other neat stuff. Folks, this is one of the greatest action films of all time and the group rating is just plain wrong.--------------------------------------------------- ***Greetings from both the future and the past*** the former relative to when this film was released, the latter relative to those yet to find this review. Have just seen Soldier for the 9th time. It gets better each time, which is more than I can say for the reviews panning it. It is an extraordinary work on so many levels -- perfectly layered script; a tale of redemption; a tale of revenge; a tale of young vs old, new vs. proved; a metaphor for civilization; a metaphor for justice and worth. And, again, a tremendous "goodbye" from Russell to his fans, from an actor who first appeared before the camera as a kid in the 50's, and then found the grit here to deliver (literally) dialog with only his eyes." 
" SIR!!!!!","C'mon! 6.0...really??? Unique in every way. Yet another powerful performance by Kurt Russell. Entertaining from start to finish. Very underrated in my opinion. Jason Scott Lee's character Cain scared me as a kid! Effects were great for there time. Brilliant story. Hope it doesn't get a remake/reboot. My daddy had a saying, "If it ain't broke don't fix it!" 9/10" 
" Western in space","*SPOILER ALERT* SPOILER ALERT*Westerns don't get made much anymore. Filmmakers need to use other genres to fulfill their western fantasies. Just like "Vampires" with James Woods was a "Western with vampires" so "Soldier" is a "Western in space". One man against many. You meet in a deserted town and settle it all. Like real men. High Noon. Soldiers deserve to fight other soldiers.This is a very simple movie. That's why it's good. Kurt Russell is the old soldier vs. the new and improved soldiers to see who is the king. #1. The Boss. He gets thrown away on a garbage planet because he became out of date. One day the new soldiers find his planet and come down to wipe out everyone. One of those amazing coincidences that Russell was there. Soon Kurt shows them who's in charge.There's a good beginning scene involving the competition between Russell and the new soldiers. Then there is a long, slow stretch where Russell assimilates to his new planet and people and then the final showdown scene. The middle part was a tad slow but once the fresh meat arrives the action picks up. It was a decent action flick. Russell was the new sheriff in town and booted out the bad guys. I liked it."
