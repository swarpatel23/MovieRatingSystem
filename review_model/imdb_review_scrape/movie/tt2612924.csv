" A total disaster!","Lucky Kabootar is about Lucky (Eijaz Khan) who is a salesman in a tractor selling company in spite of graduating in B.Sc. Agriculture. He fantasizes about Kamana aka Kammo aka Gulabo (Shradha Das) but ends up marrying the girl-next-door Lakshmi (Kulraj Randhawa).Even after marriage, he still fantasizes about Kammo. Rather the whole Luckypur is behind Kammo, but what was so special about Kammo I could not figure out. Lucky has excuses of 'Hath Tang hai' always for not meeting Lakshmi's needs. Another character is Sunny Paji (Ravi Kissen), brother of Kammo and Dabangg of Luckypur with whom Billo (Madhavi Sharma) is madly in love. Then an accident leads Lucky to believe that his wife is dead. Instead of mourning her death, he falls into Kammo's arms. Turns out, he is not that lucky.The film is a total mess from start to end. The writers tried to add a lot of vulgar dialogues in between as it's the latest trend since Grand Masti's success. The film takes off to a different level in stupidity after the accident plot wist. Another annoying factor of the movie was that the supporting cast was too weak and the character development was very poor. There is a character named Sexy Baba in the film played by Sanjay Mishra who is a complete disaster and will annoy you with his screen presence. There is nothing much to talk about the acting performance of the lead actor Eijaz Khan or the other casts. The movie is a complete failure even for those who enjoy vulgar jokes and trashy dialogues.The film was touted to be a romantic-comedy but but there was neither comedy nor romance." 
" Lucky Kabootar ... An awful film...Erase it off...","The Plot: Lucky Kabootar did not make me feel lucky at all, rather I felt miserable after watching this awfully made film. It is claimed to fall under the genre of comedy and romance, but there was neither comedy nor romance.There is a village Luckypur, where Lucky (Eijaz Khan) lives who lands up as a salesman in a tractor selling company in spite of graduating in B.Sc. Agriculture. He fantasizes about Kamana aka Kammo aka Gulabo (Shradha Das) but ends up marrying Lakshmi (Kulraj Randhawa). Even after marriage, he still fantasizes about Kammo. Rather the whole Luckypur is behind Kammo, but what was so special about Kammo I could not figure out. Lucky has excuses of 'Hath Tang hai' always for not meeting Lakshmi's needs. Another character is Sunny Paji (Ravi Kissen), brother of Kammo and Dabangg of Luckypur with whom Billo (Madhavi Sharma) is madly in love.And then there is another annoying character Sexybaba (Sanjay Mishra). Oh! What a disappointment to watch him after his 'Aankhon Dekhi'. He fulfills people's desires with two female minions on either side – hard drive and pen drive. Movie is with lot of vulgar dialoguesSituations unfold in such a manner that Lucky ends up believing that he has lost Lakshmi in an accident. What follows thereafter – Lucky's journey of mourning (or celebration) ??? Please don't be even bothered to know it I kept on wondering what these actors Eijaz Khan, Ravi Kissen, Sanjay Mishra, Kulraj Randhawa are doing in this horribly made film."
