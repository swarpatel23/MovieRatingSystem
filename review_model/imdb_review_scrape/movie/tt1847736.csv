" Polished","I was pleasantly surprised with the polished performance turned in by Akash (Mikaal Zulfiqar). I have had the opportunity to teach MBAs in New York Polytechnic and Rutgers, and can certify that this was a very real depiction of a Wall Street tycoon. Nothing over the top, calm, poised, confident. He genuinely plays the piano, and rendered the song with such elan and intensity it seemed he was a concert pianist.The movie had a relaxed but confident forward motion. I gave it a 9 because the heroine's dresses were over the top. Otherwise this was a 10.And I appreciated the director's not inserting cheesy villains or extending the story just because it had to be of a certain length. Its a pretty confident move to have both new leads, but this was a casting coup.Watch it with a glass of wine in your hand, and prepare to be transported." 
" A Romantic Movie Really Worth Watching","I don't watch too many Bollywood Indian Films because many of them are silly and don't make sense. However this film is a romantic love story which is sensible, logical and worth watching. Its a fast pace film that keeps you engaged. The music is superb and the picturization of songs is excellent. U R My Jaan leaves you feeling quite emotional in the end." 
" Worth a watch for those interested in romance genre","Despite I am not much into watching Indian movies , this one actually gripped my interest overall . Sweet story with good acting by main characters Akash and Reena, as well as the supporting actors . It was well directed , and nothing seemed to be boring and out of the way. It also makes you think that money is not everything , as it cannot buy love and happiness . And the influence of love on a business-oriented billionaire is well portrayed in this movie. I can say that I had a good time watching this film and would suggest to watch if you have an interest in romantic movies.Good job and I give it an 8 out 10."
