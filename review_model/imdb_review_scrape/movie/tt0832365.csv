" why do I watch this ****?","My summer holidays are almost 3 months long, as a consequence I tend to get bored, and so I watch far too many movies, good bad and ugly. Unfortunately, that is my only excuse for having watched this dismal film.I'm finding it difficult in deciding how to begin bashing this movie. What was worse: acting, story, editing, screenplay? It's hard to decide.The story is simple, a bunch of young Indian friends living in Dubai, and their individual as well as intersecting stories. Something that could have turned out to be a small budget hit is completely ruined by terrible story and rubbish acting.The movie only gets a 2 for the song meri kahani, which is worth listening to.Rest assured, definitely not worth a watch. As for why I'm wasting my time writing this comment, just to warn other unwary viewers from watching this movie."
