" Fresh faces might have ruined it a bit","I have watched the original Tamil 3-4 times so far and I like most of the one-lines , subtle and non-gross humor. Also the fantastic music.But the Hindi version might have lost something in translation. I watched it but its not a bad movie. I agree that the supporting cast has done a better job than the new hero-heroine. And the ending makes all the twists and turns pointless. But I guess Gautam menon was not sure if the Hindi audience would accept the same Tamil ending. I hope that someone who has fallen in love with a girl and lost her would be able to relate to the story. For the same reason, I urge all to watch the director's cut version with the alternate ending.But still the movie is not as bad like the critics have reviewed. The whole point of the movie is that this is a story about a 22 year old boy who is acting like a 19 year and a girl who is confused and prefer to suffer than go against her parents. Don't expect super melodrama or cheap comedy or item numbers. I have lost count of friends who have told its their story.I give 7 stars because of the dialogs, music, camera, good performances by support cast." 
" Just as the tagline states: A perfect romance ... more or less","In all honesty I've not seen the Tamil or Telugu version of this movie. But it seems people that have seen them don't seem to like the Hindi version.I was awaiting this film before even seeing the trailer. Once I saw the trailer I got even more excited. Loved most of the songs and finally went and saw the movie 1st Day 1st Show. Unfortunately I was the only person in the movie theater. That was kinda odd but cool at the same time.The 2hr 45min film's biggest flaw is it's slow pace. But it makes up for it thanks to the super awesome songs, Kerala has been shot wonderfully, Prateik Babbar's brilliant acting. I hope he becomes the industry's biggest star. Amy Jackson did really well considering she's a first timer and looked gorgeous. The story was beautiful as well.On the whole I'm happy with the product. The film failed at the box office which is quite unfortunate. I hope Gautam Menon continues to direct Hindi movies in the future. If you haven't seen the Tamil / Telugu version, watch Ekk Deewana Tha. If you have seen the Tamil / Telugu version ... no comments." 
" It doesn't offer anything new but isn't that bad at all as rated in the review market.","The latest offering from Bollywood once again reveals the dark side of today's "Review Market" prevailing in the Industry. Where last week's EK MAIN AUR EKK TU didn't really deserved the 3-4 stars ratings given by many, the current week's EKK DEEWANA THA also doesn't deserve the 1-2 star ratings by most of the critics, stating it as a very poor film. So there is evidently a huge imbalance in the reviews which largely get influenced by the production house and stars in the film instead of the product's actual content.Coming to EKK DEEWANA THA, it certainly isn't any great piece of art or path-breaking film with some fresh ideas. It talks about the same ages old love story between two young souls, who not only have a slight age difference but they also come from two extremely diverse regional & religion backgrounds causing all the problems. The script can easily be called predictable as we have already seen the same emotional drama umpteen times before on the screen. But still EDT isn't a complete washout as being written in many reputed reviews. It's a sweet film with a refreshing first half which keeps you engaged and entertained till the interval. Plus it also has its moments post intermission resulting in an above average film far better than many craps churned out by some big production houses in the name of Love Stories.Following the current remake trend EKK DEEWANA THA is the Hindi version of director Gautham Menon's earlier 2 hits namely VINNAITHAANDI VARUVAAYAA (Tamil) and YE MAAYA CHESAVE (Telugu). In the initial reels it even reminds you of Kamal Hassan-Rati Agnihotri starrer EK DUJE KE LIYE which also revolved around a love affair in some similar circumstances. But as it progresses it moves on to a different path involving an interesting marriage sequence and its loving results. So what's watchable in this routine love-saga? The answer comes in the form of Amy Jackson, Manu Rishi and to a certain extent Prateik too. However the sole charmer in the film remains Amy who looks stunningly gorgeous especially in the Indian outfits. Though she doesn't get a well defined character (who remains confused) along with a poor make-up in many scenes, still she keeps the viewer hooked on to her innocent beauty till the end and acts well. The second reason why EDT rises above a routine love story is Manu Rishi, who holds the film together with his natural style and entertaining one liners particularly in the first half. But if only he had something more to do in the script, it would have resulted in a much finer product for the audience. Prateik manages to impress in his casual approach towards the role but the boy seriously needs to work harder on his dance and emotional scenes. At times both his body language and dialogue delivery goes in an awkward zone which hampers the impact of his otherwise fine performance. In the supporting cast Sachin Khedekar performs the best as Prateik's friendly father. Apart from the actors it's the Cinematography (taking you on to a Kerala tour) and few songs by A. R. Rahman which raise the standard of this routine love story. Yet the maestro isn't in his full form in the movie as he once again gives a soundtrack below expectations with traces of "Kabhi Kabhi Aditi" (Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na) in his "Hosanna"". Actually EDT is a fine film till the intermission and it doesn't disappoint the viewer despite of having a routine storyline mainly due to its fresh pair and Manu. In fact this is the reason why Love Stories have always been there in every decade featuring two unknown faces since they can easily make an instant connection with the public and can deliver a Hit. But EDT is not able to reach that crescendo due to its pretty weak second half and a prolonged climax which eventually ends on an "All is Well" note unexpectedly. It would have been a different film altogether if it had a more realistic climax where there was no re-union of the lovers but they still remained friends living their separate lives in two different parts of the world.The writers falter in a big way as they are not able to define the character of the girl in a justified manner. Yes a girl in love remains always in a dilemma to choose between her boyfriend and her parents. But the writers here give no proper justification for their parting away from each other all of a sudden. Moreover it all starts dragging in the last 30 minutes without any purpose, which fails to leave any kind of loving impact on the viewers. In my opinion the love-affair in the film should have ended right there in the Taj Mahal corridors showing a married Amy saying good bye to Prateik and the film should have ended with everyone praising the directorial venture of Pratiek being loudly cheered by Manu Rishi standing along with him in the theater. That would have been a more ideal and realistic ending of a tragic love story as I see it.Anyhow, in its present version EKK DEEWANA THA is a sweet film with a fine first half and a beautiful Amy which surely can be watched once without any doubt. So if you are really interested in love stories, then please forget all the negative reviews you might have read about the movie as it certainly isn't that bad at all as being projected in those well publicized write-ups." 
" Gr8 movie my favourite of recent times","A movie for all the lovers....people who are passionate,enthusiastic and have an emotional side.The movie reminded me of old beautiful legends of Hindi which were truly based on love.Today love stories are not LOVE STORIES only...they have a mixture of comedy,action ...and thats why people dint like this movie.acting:superb !! storyline:emotional and realistic.Amy was stunning !she has a great career ahead!all those scenes when the guy is spellbound by the girl's charm are treat to the eyes.you remain on the edge throughout the movie although its a romantic one.The movie made an after effect which today's movies lack totally! i highly recommend dis movie..go watch it with your love u'll enjoy it sincerely!" 
" Good romance with very good music...","Another remake of Gautham Menon from his own Tamil movie. A Telegu version was made after the Tamil one. So, this Hindi version is the 3rd version or 2nd remake of the original one.Nowadays, a lot of Hindi movies are being remaked from Tamil originals. And, people who follows Tamil movies believes that Tamil movies are big time ahead of Hindi Cinema. So, we see a lot of frustration from those audiences who watched either of the two early versions of Ekk Deewana Tha! However, I will recommend to those who loves romantic bollywood films and hadn't seen any of those early two versions, should watch. I really loved the movie, though it have some technical issues. Pratiek Babbar did a really nice job with the leading role of Sachin, a wanna be film maker who makes himself a successful one at the end of the story. He falls in love with his neighbor Jassi and chases his love with the struggle of being a filmmaker. The movie has lots of good music by A R Rahman. Amy Jackson played the role of Jassi and did an OK job with her Bollywood debut. She is a stunning British beauty and its really a treat watching her on screen! Kerala is another beauty of the film with some lovely cinematography.Director Gautham Menon did his job handsomely keeping a good slow pace without any monotonous pause till the end. Overall a good 7/10 romantic bollywood film with some good cinematography and music!" 
" Truly amazing","I have watched this movie several times. Several means really several. This movie is very close to my heart. Every scene, dialogue are just awesome. How can one make such a cute movie. This is one of my all time favorite. Ohh... i always feel my eyes wet while watching. Last scene, the meeting at Tajmahal... OMG...Special character, Ananya. No language barrier for this masterpiece. Hindi or Tamil etc..(though i north Indian so can understand only Hindi)I still do not have its HIGH RES print or may be it was not released. If somebody has please share... please... Hossana.. the song... what a composition, lyrics.. music... bravo.. Pratik, Amy...Will always remain close to my heart..

" An Immortal Love story at least for me","I have seen mixed comments on this movie - I have not seen it's Tamil Original but personally I'll rank it among one of my bests. I have a reason to do so - I could relate every bit of it to my own love life (needless to say it was in total mess at that time). Feeling it personally makes a movie good or bad to watch. For me - it touched me. Other than that - this movie has an excellent couple of good songs. Prateik and Amy have given their bests and were totally into it while shooting. Specially the scene on the park of Taj Mahal - deep down into it, Prateik have given it a real touch. Prateik danced wonderfully great, but Amy lacked in this part. Worth a watch." 
" Its a very light film to watch...with amazing soundtrack","Prateik Babbar is an outstanding actor whose got a lot to offer. He proves in this film that he can do what ever a hero is supposed to do ACT, DANCE and FIGHT. His character in this film is a true depiction of how 20+ guys act these days. Props to the direction as well for highlighting that so well. Also Amy Jackson's performance was notably well seeing that she hasn't really done any Hindi bollywood films before.The story on the other hand is pure yet simple love story with regular issues people face and the pace of the film matched the plot. Though I would have loved to see a bit more drama.If your looking to see a light relaxing sort of film, this definitely falls into that category." 
" Gautam Menon, you have just lost a loyal fan of yours!","First of all, I heartily apologize to all the people (my friends, colleagues and blog mates) for seriously recommending you the movie; I did it just because I thought (like every Tollywood fan) that the movie is a remake of Tamil super hit "Vinnaaithandi Vaaruvaayaa". To my utter disappointment, the movie is actually remake of Telugu semi hit "Ye Maaya Chesaave".To all those who have no idea about VTV or YMC, let me clear the clouds. Gautam Menon directed VTV (Vinnaithandi Varuvaayaa), starring Silambarasan and Trisha. The movie due to its unusual climax is considered to be a classic love story. Next, Gautam directed the same movie in Telugu language with Nag Chaitanya (on recommendation by his father Nagarjuna) and Samantha, with exactly opposite ending than the Tamil one. YMC received an average response from public as well as critics.Now, Gautam Menon has selected the conventional climax of Ye Maaya Chesaave, rather than VTV, and that is what will make this film a sure deserved flop! I personally did not like YMC at all, and this Hindi movie is actually a remake of YMC! I am feeling cheated Mr. Menon!It takes a lifetime of a filmmaker to deliver a masterpiece movie. But if the filmmaker himself doesn't cherish about it, then it seems that the movie was a masterpiece rather by fluke.I am not even interested to review this movie further, but I will do it just for the sake of formality.Cast: Prateik Babbar excels as Sachin, the lesser said about Ammy Jackson is better. Manu Rishi is noteworthy.Story And Screenplay: Nothing new in "this" version of movie and the screenplay is extremely weak with no subplots and overdose of songs.Editing And Cinematography: Editing is poor, cinematography is first rate.Music And Background Score: I chose not to review EDT's music as I can't move on from VTV and YMC's music. Background Score is remastered and is brilliant.Direction: Sorry Mr. Menon, you have just lost a loyal fan!Verdict:Please avoid this film.Period." 
" A simple, feel good and realistic love saga true to it's cultural roots as well as modernism","In this Gautham Menon's remake of his own tamil film,Sachin, a young mechanical engineering graduate, now aspires to make it to bollywood. During all of these struggles, he falls in love with Jessie, the daughter of his landlord. Now Sachin tries to strike a balance between his career struggles and Jessie's situation. But Jessie belongs to a strict, conservative family, and not only that, she belongs to a different religion. The fact that this film failed at the box office is disappointing but not entirely shocking. A relatively new cast, slow pace, nothing over the top, nothing larger than life, the film came and went and nobody seemed to notice. The only real "popular" names attached to this film are those of the maestro "ARR" and the lyrical genius Javed Akhtar. However what really upset me was the fact that this film received a lot of bashing from the critics as well. That is what compelled me to write this review. Even though the title of the film suggests that the efforts of the protagonist would be extravagant, it suggests that this film would be, just like countless other cinematic portrayals of love, flamboyant, and something which looks good on screen but would be very difficult to find in real life. However, in reality the film is simple, feel good, and quite realistic. The actions of the characters are inconsistent, but that is what makes it real. The characters are just those which each and every one of us can find all around us. A friend acting as a sidekick, middle class parents critical of one's career choice, a sarcastic dad, a confused girl, not really sure of what stance can be taken. Talking about inconsistencies, Jessie suddenly tells Sachin she doesn't love him anymore, previously she told him that she loves him immensely. Jessie can wear a sari, but at another day she can wear jeans. Sachin, who is mad for Jessie, doesn't want to leave her side for one moment, suddenly tells Jessie not to come to him, and wait for his shoot schedule to end. All these inconsistencies aren't the film's weaknesses, as what critics would think, they actually make the film realistic and believable. Because in reality we all are inconsistent with weaknesses, we all keep changing, our mindsets and attitudes. Sachin, even though a passionate lover, doesn't perform over the top acts like deciding to change his religion or his career for Jessie, just what happens in many other "epic" love stories. He, instead does what a sane person would do, try to balance things logically, and see what happens. Even the action sequences are simple and not overdone. A few punches and that's it, no blowing up of cars or "bhai's" punches. No taking off of shirts. It's simple. The cultural portrayals are good and mostly realistic. The Mumbai culture and lifestyle is shown appropriately. An office going girl and a "vela" wannabe film director boy, who has completed engineering probably due to family pressures, but whose heart belongs somewhere else. The scenes in Kerala are shot beautifully, the cinematography is brilliant. So the film, to a large deal is also filled with the ambiance of Kerala. This adds to the feel good factor of the film. Another thing which the critics tried to mock was the slow pace of the film, however it was essential, as the film wanted to show the journey, the entire path that the relationship of Jessie and Sachin took, from the point when they were strangers to the point they lived happily ever after. It is still cut down a great deal from the original Tamil version, many plot points being integrated in songs( e.g. the moving of Sachin's family to their own new house). These are small details, which add more meaning to the film, which the critics blatantly ignored or missed out. This film doesn't tell what hasn't been told before in cinema, there are countless other films which tread on the same topics and themes, e.g. parents not agreeing with marriage, an abusive brother etc. But what this film does differently is presenting all these things in a simple, feel good and realistic manner. There are a few weaknesses, e.g. a somewhat disjointed screenplay, from the moment Jessie leaves onwards. However, it is covered up as the film has a soul. The dialogues are crisp. Prateik puts in a brilliant performance, Amy Jackson is good. ARR is at his best, as both the songs and the background score are heart touching and magical. Overall, don't look at the deprecatory critic reviews or the poor box office performance, give this film a watch, it deserves one." 
" story good but could have been better.nice movie in spite of its a remake of "Will You Cross the Skies for Me?" a south Indian film.","well it was a nice movie i liked the story till the taj mahal part where they meet again and she told him that she is not married. but before that seen the story was really good.the writer wrote a good story but he could have made it more better if the ending was good.i mean if there were a little twist like the film showed earlier.in some parts there may be some improvisation from the south Indian film.story is not that bad.over all except the last part i liked the movie.As new comer both of them did well.screen play was good.it was a nice movie in spite of its a remake of "Will You Cross the Skies for Me?" a south Indian film." 
" Direction, screenplay, editing really bad",".. so does the acting. Amy had a impressive presence and a great freshness throughout the movie. But other than that, the direction, screenplay and editing was really bad. With a better actor and better technicalities, the movie could have been a super duper romantic flick.Only good thing about the movie is amy's presence and kerala shoots. Nothing new in the story as well. Music was bit good, hosana is the song keeps lingering in mind all the time.I seriously wish, someone should do a better remake of the movie keeping Amy and kerala intact.Five * only for Amy and Kerala" 
" The director got the title wrong; maybe Ek Deewani thi would have made more sense.. well, never mind!","Prateik(Sachin) is a guy belonging to a Hindu family and desires to be a film maker. Amy (Jessie) is a Christian girl from Kerala who works in an IT firm. And we have a typical Bollywood love story at hand. Sachin is madly in love with Jessie at first glance and guess what, Jessie doesn't love him. Their parents aren't the best of kins either which forces Jessie to get married to a well settled guy. However, on her wedding day in front of the priest, our leading lady has other plans. Post intermission, Jessie admits her love and both enjoy the relationship phase. Meanwhile, Jessie's parents continue to force her to get married to the same guy. At this, Jessie wants to run away with Sachin, but he is shooting a film in Mangalore. Jessie breaks the relationship and is out of Sachin's life settled and married somewhere in UK. A year or so passes and the couple reunite in Delhi and needless to say how the movie ends.Prateik delivers another honest performance. Amy Jackson has nothing to offer except her pretty looks. The music is a typical AR Rahman work. On the whole 'Ekk Deewana Tha' isn't even worth a 'ekk time watch'." 
" BAD!....No story","Ek Deewana ThaThere is nothing to make you fall for this one!....if you are not already tired of watching boring big Bollywood cinema, you would certainly be after this one... Not to be too cynical about the movie, but it doesn't really live up to its make! In fact why did they remake this movie at all? And if it was hit in Tamil and Telugu, it would have surely better written dialogues.The script - is by far the most annoying! Not only does it not have any coherence, the story is also story less. There are other films which do not have a story ( Chalo Dilli), but have had better outcomes in terms of the dialogues and the direction. But this one fails in all counts. The boy falls in love with just one look, and chases the girl. She being Christian and a Malayalee, the boy ( a Hindu, from Mumbai) chases her to Allepy and witnesses her rejecting her marriage. The idea behind it was that she had something towards the boy, which she couldn't express. Finally the expression comes, and this is the part which is the most 'not thought' after. There could have been better dialogues at least. The effect of a Bollywood 'romanc-a-tainer' is just not there in this one.The Actors - are as fresh as new college students needed training. They sure light up the space, cause there is nothing else to the movie that keeps me tied to it. Pratiek has done reasonably well, and given that he is starting his career is worth the shot. Moreover, fresh faces are welcome. But fresh faces just for namesake are where the movie again fails. Amy is not at all a 'Malayalee'. She was searching for expressions the entire movie. This was not a movie where her charms would work through her super model figure! This needed expressions, and dialogue delivery. The role of Manu Rishi was refreshing and was the only well-tailored character. The direction - Barring the scenery in God's own Country, the film has little directorial skills to offer. A director's vision is something which comes out of the movie. Rather than aping the previous movies, if he would have added something which has a better context, it would have been better. If on the other hand he was not interested to change it, he could have still checked whether it is still coherent and the story flows! Alas, nothing was done, and nothing came out! For me the film has no other layers to figure out. The story could have made better sense, and had the intentions of bringing out a familial aspect to love stories, but it never reached its own aspirations. We would have to wait for 2 states adaptation for this issue to be re- screened again! Lets hope they treat it well next time.Watch More movies for now!...Don't give up so soon!" 
" luckily ekk hi deewana tha","just watched "ekk deewana tha" it's like cheap gum with very little juice in it. so MR director thought of stretching it in playful-mood for good 130 minutes to just say their was a boy and a girl who fall in love by just watching each other awfully great. amy looks Beautiful but fake like d woman who sell detergent on TV. prateik was good compared to other star cast but he was soda without gas u can see few bubbles but no fizz. only songs had sum juice in them. some how i felt it was a alien movie. better if they made a music video. "Ekk deewana tha (director) "Ekk paagal tha (amy) "Ekk awara tha (prateik).so if u r no Awara Paagal Deewana just AVOID...." 
" Tollywood remakes can not attract Bollywood audience always... Here is an example !","About Ekk Deewana Tha(EDT): The film is  a remake of Tollywood hit "Vinnaithandi Varuvaayaa" ...but climax plot is inspired by  "Ye Maaya Chesaave".RHTDM fame Guatam  Menon may be  successful director of Tollywood but for bollywood   you will have to wait Mr. MenonA slow pace movie .. Which has  surfeit of Rahman's song.  Aaaahhhh ! Love at first site .... And romance in the film can not convince you in Toto.. Few plots are nice to watch... And rest of them are dragging the movie...Prateik  is getting better as an actor but still he needs to improve to carry entire film on his shoulder ! Gorgeous Amy Jackson looks magnificent in the saree with her contours ! That is the only best part of hers in the movie !Maths of Amy Jackson may be good   In EDT  but chemistry and physics with Prateik  is not admirable ! Supporting actors have done better than the leads !To conclude :  fresh bachelors, true Tollywood fan and few others who can correlate ..   May like the film.....
