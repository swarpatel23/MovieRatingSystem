" Bollywood - for real....","When a successor hones the talents and legacy of the master, it reflects on the creativity of the apprentice. Zoya Akhtar follows the legendary footsteps of her father and gives us a story so familiar, yet so unique and credible. Her directional debut with 'Luck By Chance' proves to be a writer and director's accomplishment that is complemented by exemplary performances even though they may include numerous cameos. Farhan and Konkana embrace the characters of 2 struggling artists in the Hindi film industry with ease and subtlety. The film is about Vikram Jaisingh, a sincere young Delhiite whose dream is to make it to the big screen in Bollywood and a struggling 'extra', Sona Sharma who plays brief and meaningless roles in 'B' grade films while making compromises to even make it this far. This story is also about Zaffar Khan (Hrithik Roshan) who is tired of playing the filmy hero for the same producer, Romy Rolly (Rishi Kapoor) over and over. He simply wants a break with Karan Johar's upcoming movie. Khan's apparent unwillingness to work with Rolly finally gives him the chance in Johar's film while our struggler gets lucky by chance as the replacement. So begins the spoof on bollywood film making and the hypocrisy of the stars and starlets. While Vikram has just found his companion in Sona, the outdoor shoot for Rolly's film brings him casually closer to Niki Walia (Isha Sherwani), the gorgeous daughter of the erstwhile glamour queen Neena Walia (Dimple). Relationships fail, strain and ignite in this film that apart from all stories that lie entangled is about realizing one's dreams in an adverse reality. Then, when dreams turn into reality, one realizes that fame and success are a "dangerous intoxication", rightly advised by ShahRukh Khan. Luck By Chance is about the Hindi film industry and what makes it 'Bollywood' as we know it. The eccentric individuals, the stereotypical characters posing as experienced producers, veteran actors, unyielding directors, junior artists, hypocritical stars and the real gems in the industry. One has to get dirty to play in the mud and thus it brings success to some. While the chase to destiny tends to derail the dream train of even the earnest, it embraces those who endlessly strive toward it with a bit of Luck.Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music is pleasant and soulful with Javed Akhtar's lyrics. The film opens with a glimpse into the industry with the meaningful and enriching Yeh Zindagi bhi and ends with the soulful O Raahi Re while Sapno se bhare naina portrays the turmoil within a dreamer. Sadly, Hrithik's item song Bawre fails to leave a lasting impression. Konkana Sen performs at her brilliant best with realism being at the crux of her versatility. Isha Sherwani plays the spoilt heroine convincingly while her on-screen mother Dimple Kapadia looks gorgeous as ever and gives her best after Dil Chahta Hai. Juhi Chawla is lovable as ever while Sanjay Kapoor surprises us with a good performance. Rishi Kapoor enacts the stereotypical Sindhi producer to perfection with his wit and zest while Hrithik underplays his real persona to play Zaffar Khan, an actor in a career ambivalence of sorts. Farhan proves yet again that he can be an actor almost as good as he is a director. Almost...there are parts where he is totally unconvincing, especially when he is romancing Isha in the lush green outdoors of the Konkan region. But his emotions are subtle in effect and dialogue delivery stronger than that in his own show on T.V. The rest of the supporting cast plays their parts aptly to the script's demand while the cameos by the stars are for the first time, justified in purpose. Even though ShahRukh Khan or Karan Johar might have just a few lines to say, the impact lasts long enough. But the film's biggest hero is Javed Akhtar. His exemplary writing, part in story and in dialogue is what makes the film remarkable. Zoya's direction could not have done much without such a strong story and script even though it may not show the audience something they haven't seen before. In the end, Luck By Chance wins hearts through its subtle story telling. Even though it may be a mocking tale of 'Bollywood', it never gets loud or exaggerated. While remaining very real, the story never turns into a Madhur Bhandarkar style 'hard hitting' real. Instead, the subtle rendering of the film world's reality and an achiever's journey through it leaves a lasting impact which will appease in the same manner even over a second watch. Luck By Chance shows typical Bollywood fare in an atypical manner and brings to the spotlight, Zoya Akhtar.8.64 on a scale of 1-10." 
" About luck by chance and chance by luck (or by flattery)","Many films in the last few years have been centred around the Hindi film industry. Some have portrayed it as a bright world, some have portrayed it as sleazy, and some just used it as a way to tell a story. Luck by Chance belongs to the latter category. It is not as much about the industry as it is about young people who try to succeed in it. It is essentially about people who struggle to carve their own niche in some particular profession and the way they do it. In this case, it is acting. This is the story of Vikram (Farhan Akhtar) who arrives in Mumbai to pursue an acting career in the film industry. He starts dating Sona (Konkona Sen Sharma), who is senior to him in the movie business but is still waiting for her big break. The film is decorated by many appearances by actors and filmmakers who play either themselves or some fictional characters, which is an obvious attempt to make the film more realistic (or maybe more appealing?). And these appearances are indeed very lovely. The film's concept of the rise of one young actor is a bit hard to believe considering he has made only one film after all, but it is quite a common standard today. I found the portrayal of the industry reasonably fair, satirically humorous yet somewhat inconsistent (well, any commercial cinema is really not that crazy about real talents as it is about commercial appeal, but filmmakers very rarely admit it). I did like, however, the way the film showed how complicated making one movie can be and how important (or disruptive) media hype can be. It was all nicely put together with a message: never forget who you are and where you come from.Farhan Akhtar's performance was not completely consistent and although as a performer he is a natural, he fails to register the growth in his character. The film belongs to Konkona Sen Sharma who is as fine as ever in the great role of Sona. She is natural, convincing, and shows the struggle, disappointment, pain and later on the overcoming her character goes through without having to go to unnecessary extents. Rishi Kapoor is quite funny while Dimple Kapadia is wonderful and beautiful as always. Juhi Chawla, in quite an insignificant comic role, is amazing, beautiful and completely charming. Shahrukh Khan gets a brief but very pivotal role, but Hrithik is annoying as the less-witty-more-arrogant film star. All in all, I enjoyed the film for being basically not very negative as, say, Madhur Bhandarkar, would have made it. The story is narrated well and Zoya Akhtar makes an impressive directorial debut because she somehow manages to poke fun at the film industry and yet leave a nice impression of it. I think those who want to become actors will find the film a bit disturbing though. But as I said, Luck by Chance is essentially about people who struggle to carve their own niche in some particular profession, and it does show some ray of hope. Towards the end, the film becomes increasingly more interesting. We see how people don't let failure deter them. On the contrary, we see how they keep struggling indirectly and how they finally come to terms with what they are capable of doing and what they are just not." 
" Simply Fascinating!","Are you fascinated by the place that is the Hindi Film Industry? Have you obsessed about the superstars there and religiously followed what's happening in their lives? Have you ever wondered how this Industry works? Have you ever secretly harbored ambitions of being in this dream land? If yes, what are your chances of surviving and making it big? Zoya Akhtar's maiden directorial venture 'Luck By Chance' is a thumping answer to these and many more questions! If Om Shanti Om was a take on Hindi Cinema of the 1970s then 'Luck By Chance' is a highly authentic take on the Hindi Film Industry in the modern era. It's a fantastic behind the scenes journey into this dream land known as Bollywood. No wonder that this authenticity could have only come from one of the well known families of the Industry - the Akhtar family, who are the makers of this film. The tale is essentially of their own immediate environment and it is a story that is told well!The screenplay revolves around the two central characters played by Farhan Akhtar and Konkona Sharma trying to make it big in Bollywood. Farhan comes to Mumbai from Delhi, lives in his aunt's house and borrows money from all quarters whereas Konkona is in a 'mutually beneficial' relationship with some producer to get a lead role and also has a friend who is a homo-sexual, BUT wait, before you scream 'cliché' and think that this will go the Madhur Bhandarkar way, you realize that the treatment is not as sensationalistic and hovering around extremes as Madhur Bhandarkar's movies. Luck By Chance is subtle but highly effective! The two lead character's lives take us inside and up-close to the scenes behind the camera. We have the Desi producer played by Rishi Kapoor, a yesteryear's starlet (Dimple Kapadia) who is launching her talentless daughter (Isha Sherwani) and apart from these characters we have the who's who of Bollywood playing themselves. Luck By Chance is a casting coup! The film is an unabashed take on Hindi Cinema and it does not hold back from mocking it. We have one director saying "What the hell do I have to do with the script, I am not making the film for a film festival!" The same director hands over a Hollywood DVD to the film writer and tells him to Indianise the story! It also shows the corporate culture setting into bollywood, the corporates who want to model themselves after the Hollywood studios and describe the script as the main property only to change their stance later and determine whether to finance or not on the basis of which super-star is playing the lead! Hrithik Roshan is a sport, who in an extended cameo charmingly portrays the character of 'Zaffar Khan', a bratty superstar who walks out of a film and creates enormous trouble for the veteran producer. The same role after being rejected by other established actors and after a series of fortunate circumstances, struggle and talent is bagged by the protagonist Vikram played by Farhan Akhtar.The story of Luck By Chance is well woven. It wonderfully depicts the journey of each of the characters. The negative shades in each of them are shown, not in implausible extremes, but in a true to life way. How charmingly it captures those very real things  jealously and ego battles between friends, relatives who have the word, 'Riddance' on their mind when you live with them away from your home, of how the best of relationships break when individual interests become dominant.It is surprising to see the high degree of naturalness, intensity and charm that Farhan Akhtar brings to his character. It's an A grade performance which makes you speculate that a few years down the line, Farhan will be known as an actor who also directs and not vice versa. Konkona playing the female lead has a role which was perhaps written with only her in mind and she does an excellent job. The veteran Rishi Kapoor shows us what an enigmatic force he still is behind the camera! Playing the veteran producer his is the most endearing character in the film! The rest of the ensemble cast  Dimple Kapadia, Isha Sherwani, Juhi Chawla, and Sanjay Kappot do justice to their roles. A special compliment goes out to the guy who plays Farhan's friend. The flame of jealousy and complexes that this character is meant to convey are tough to depict but he succeeds effortlessly.The cameos are brilliantly pulled off, with Aamir and SRK shining in their separate parts. Aamir is shown shooting for a period film in a brilliantly setup set and you wish that such period movies were actually made by the Hindi Film Industry. SRK is in a 2 minute cameo, where in a party, in an interaction with the new star that Farhan Akhtar's character has become, gives the most powerful and defining lines in the movie, lines which were perhaps not given to the dialog writers but have been his own firm values that have made him the biggest superstar of this Industry. As always, Excel Entertainment brings excellent production values to the film in each department. The music composed by the trio of Shankar Ehsaan Loy surely doesn't disappoint and it slowly grows on you after watching the movie. The track 'Yeh Zindagi Bhi' stands out.Lastly, hats off Zoya Akhtar and Farhan Akhtar for making a film that they knew at the very outset will appeal to only a niche audience. It is this experimentation and willingness to experiment that is required in this Multiplex era. Luck By Chance is a feast that is a must see for people who are in awe of the Indian film fraternity." 
" Wow...! Brilliant!","It makes me feel so happy to see a product like Luck By Chance coming out of India. A land full of commercial cinema! I enjoyed Luck By chance to the fullest. Zoya Akthar made a brilliant debut as a director, I could not find any flaws. Farhan Akthar is one damn good actor, he expresses so good with his face. It might be because he is a brilliant director himself and knows how to deliver performances.The cast of the whole movie was very convincing, Rishi Kapoor as Rolly was hilarious but very impactful, Konkona delivers a fine performance yet again, she is one of the best actresses in the country. All the cameos made sense and wasn't commercial just like Om Shanti Om for instance. The music was used very well, no unnecessary playbacking portions, no misplacement of the songs. Sapno se bhare naina was very beautiful, Pyaar ki dastaan is shot very well aswel. Zoya Akhtar is one director to look out for, she left me speechless. SRK's cameo is very effective, his last dialogue is very effective.Awesome with a capitcal "A"!Well done Zoya, Farhan, Konkona!" 
" brilliant movie..","a lovely movie, coherent script, brilliant creativity and direction. each and every frame (as they call in the movie) makes sense.the story is optimistic and talks of how taking chances may get you what you desire. having a deep meaning and portraying it in a movie is difficult. however, Zoya does that perfectly. the moral of the story is "fortune favors the brave." something we've seen in lot of motivational, war and heroic movies. but the brilliance of this movie is that it targets the commonness and makes one relate to either of the protagonist characters. be it Farhan or Konkona, both have strong characters and a subtle difference. the supporting cast also shows idealism, hard work, fire and the unsettled mind wanting to achieve something.In all, a brilliant movie with a strong message. and don't forget some eye candy, too. Isha looks flamboyantly amazing, portraying an important class of character. In all, i am sure every role defined in the movie fits either in one of us and our lives. bravo !! 10/10" 
" The movie is superb: For lovers of intelligent cinema","I was completely taken by surprise by this film. I wasn't planning on watching it, but I am glad I did. It is terrific. This is easily one of the best films I have seen recently. It's Bollywood at its finest. The story is an insider look at the Bollywood film industry and the struggle of actors to get noticed in Bollywood. It deals with a range of issues like casting couch, movie business, actors images, hopes and aspirations and showbiz politics. It does so in a subtle and understated manner, yet is incredibly engaging. The film is very intelligently written and the dialogues are sharp and true to life. The characters are instantly likable. They are complex and seem like they are straight out of life. The acting is brilliant from the entire cast. You will find yourself hanging onto their every word and expression.The most noticeable aspect of this film is how sincere and understated it is. There is very little use of background music and embellishments. The film completely hinges on the superbly-written drama and acting. It's a delight to watch Farhan Akhtar, Konkona Sen Sharma act and their scenes together exude warmth and innocence.It is difficult to believe this is Zoya Akhtar's directional debut. Her direction is flawless and technically brilliant. It seems effortless in fact. It's as if direction is natural to her as breathing. I also admire how balanced her portrayal of the Bollywood film industry is. She takes some digs at many Bollywood conventions, but never in a cynical or contemptuous way, more as acknowledging the dynamics of industry life. Giving the outsider a remarkable and clean insight on what goes on behind the scenes.You really should see this film, especially if you enjoy intelligent cinema. This film is immensely likable for its total sincerity and innocence, personified by Farhan Akhtar's character. I would be surprised if anybody disliked it." 
" If it just didn't go on so long",""Luck By Chance" has most of the hallmarks of a typical Bollywood production: shimmering visuals, eye-popping colors and costumes, and gorgeous young performers all placed in the service of a slick-fiction melodrama, punctuated by elaborately choreographed song-and-dance numbers that play like glittery shampoo commercials on steroids. The difference here is that since it is Bollywood itself that is the subject of the film, writer/director Zoya Akhtar gets to indulge in some mild self-criticism aimed at a few of the weaknesses inherent in the industry. For instance, the movie questions why nepotism seemingly plays so large a role in the hiring of actors and actresses, an inside-joke, one assumes, since Akhtar chose her own brother, Farhan, to play the lead character in this film. It also makes fun of the fact that no self-respecting mainstream Indian film would be caught dead without at least a half a dozen musical sequences, even though they are rarely germane to the plot or integral to the theme. That doesn't, however, keep the makers of "Luck By Chance" from fulfilling their mandated quota of said sequences. Apparently, iconoclasm will take one only so far when there are box office receipts at stake."Luck By Chance" tells of an aspiring young actor named Vikram (Akhtar) who lands the lead role in what is described to us as "a big-budget thriller/musical love story." His sudden success becomes a cause of dissension between him and his girlfriend, Sona (Konkona Sen Sharma), since she is herself a struggling actress and has been unable to pick up more than mere bit parts in unimpressive films up to this point. She also becomes jealous of Vikram's co-star, the lovely Nikki Walia (Isha Sarvani), whose over-controlling mother (Dimple Kapadia) was a famous movie actress herself in the 1970s.In terms of dramaturgy and audience attention-spans, the story could definitely use some tightening, but it does capture some of the frustration, heartbreak and disappointment of trying to make it in the "biz." It also points out the capricious nature of filmdom success, making the case that it is often nothing more than sheer luck - of being at the right place at the right time or of having that indefinable "something" that sets one apart from all others - that ultimately determines who will make it as a star and who will not.The romantic scenes are nicely played by Akhtar and Sharma, but there's no getting around the fact that the movie itself runs on for such an unconscionable length of time (over two-and-a-half-hours) that audiences (Western audiences, at least) are bound to lose interest in the story quite a ways prior to its actual completion. That's a shame because there's much that is likable and charming about "Luck By Chance."" 
" Simply Superb - A Movie Worth Watching.","What can I say about this movie? This is one of the best movies that has been released so far this year and it is by an débutant, female director, who has gone on to prove her capability in directing and it deals with a simple story.A newcomer from the Indian capital, after completing a course in acting, moves down to Mumbai and tries to join the Hindi film Industry (Bollywood) and makes some friends but struggles in getting a role.Starring Farhan Akhtar, Isha Sharvani, Hrithik Roshan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Dimple Kapadia, Rishi Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Sanjay Kapoor and Anurag Kashyap. This is directed and co  written by Zoya Akhtar, co  written by Farhan Akhtar and the music score is by Shankhar Ehsan Loy. Special appearances by many, including Abhishek Bachchan, Shilpa Shetty, Shahrukh Khan, Karan Johar, Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani, John Abraham, Ranbir Kapoor, Akshaye Khanna, Ronit Roy ("Mr Bajaj" in "Kasautii Zindagi Kii" and "Mihir Virani" in "Kyunke Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi" of Balaji Telefilms TV series),Mac Mohan ("Sambha" in "Sholay"), Vivek Oberoi and Aamir "Mr Pefectionist" Khan.This gives the audience an in sight into what sometimes happens when making a movie and what happens in the industry and more when it involves the opposite sex and when you are working together. Zoya Akhtar, sister to Farhan Akhtar and daughter of Javed Akhtar, has done a superb job in her directorial debut in showing that is something believable and has also managed to show how some of the actors struggle when they first try and join the industry and the pains in being involved in a relationship.Farhan Akhtar, has once again proved that, not only is he a good director of films such as "Dil Chehta Hai" and "Don," but with his second film as an actor, the first being "Rock on," is good. In this, he has portrayed a character that can and should be considered as an ordinary person and is a believable character. The other, being Hrithik Roshan, is also good in his role. Rishi Kapoor as a big movie director is also convincing and as are Juhi Chawla and Dimple Kapadia. The special appearances by the names that I have mentioned do play a major part in this movie and are worth watching. But it made a change to see Mac Mohan after such a long time.The music score by Shankar Ehsan Loy is worth listening to but the songs are also worth as well and in particular "Bhago Re" and the dance by Hrithik to it and "Jahanmein Sunate Hai." The lyricist and father of Farhan and Zoya Akhtar, Javed Akhtar, who has been a judge on the Indian TV channel, Sony, for "Indian Idol," has also given a good break into playback singing to one of the previous contestants, Amit Paul.The entry of Zoya Akhtar as a director is a definite "feather in the cap" for the industry.This is a movie that is definitely worth watching." 
" A Nutshell Review: Luck By Chance","The opening sequence montage is beautifully designed, paying a quiet and dignified homage to the upline and downchain support functions of the entire film industry, like the guards protecting film studios and film sets, and cashiers at the box office, with the song Yeh Zindagi Bhi as a backdrop. But this serene and muted beginning is in stark contrast to everything else that is going to unfold, where humour is largely used to great effect in cushioning the unflattering commentary on the state of affairs. For example, much has been said about story lines and sets resembling some big budgeted Hollywood counterpart, and you have a director blatantly telling his scriptwriter to adopt everything from his favourite movie. A lot of satire get tossed around, and rewards the viewer paying close attention. There's even an avenue for sight gags, and one of my favourites is the poster entitled "For a Few Rupees More".The strength of Luck By Chance is in its strong story, characterization and dialogue. It plays on everyone's stereotypes, but yet doesn't turn its main characters to caricatures. It shows the distinct worlds that aspiring wannabe actors have to face, versus those born with luck on their side, being the offspring of famous and established stars in the movie world. It examines the struggles of the dream chasers coming to Mumbai looking for their big break, where it is established that lead roles only go to newcomers when they are soundly rejected by the stars, and the insecurities and threats that established stars constantly face, with the dealing of pressure and success, and maintaining that public icon. For the bevy of star childs as they are known (in my short foray into Indian films I have seen a number of up and coming ones), the mounting expectations that one has to deal from the public.Luck By Chance has a movie within the movie which the subplots are laid out against, and like all productions, funding is always key, as is the network that one has to find a foothold in because of the tacit understanding that it's about who you know and who you're related to, versus pure talent. Hence the title, where one has to be at the right place at the right time staring at the right opportunity in order to get noticed amongst thousands. Vikram Jaisingh (the director's brother Farhan Akhtar) is one such aspiring actor who moved from Delhi to Mumbai in search of stardom, and lives with 2 other friends and their neighbour Sona (Konkona Sen Sharma) who is the mistress of small time producer Chaudhary (Alyy Khan) of Pinky Productions, waiting for her big break to star in a big budgeted movie with a tailor made role. At the other end of the spectrum, we have the insecure mega-star Zaffar Khan (Hrithik Roshan, whom I think is like a chameleon in being able to shape his physique at the drop of a hat) starring in his new movie with star child Nikki Wallia (Isha Sharvani), the offspring of screen legend Neena (Dimple Kapadia). And adding plenty of colour to the events in and around this movie production, are the producer Romy Rolly (Rishi Kapoor) and his brother, the actor turned director Ranjit Rolly (Sanjay Kapoor) who share the spoils for most of the comedy.There are plenty of insider jokes spilt at every corner, making fun of commercial and art films, gossip rags and the sensationalizing of news. Upping the fun factor are a slew of cameo appearances with real stars playing themselves, and you can imagine the gasps when Aamir Khan appeared briefly in the beginning, and another Khan (I'm not revealing who amongst the three Kings, your guess) popping out to whistles from the audience for his simple role offering advice about dealing with stardom and what really matters. And to add to that if I may name drop a little, Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham, Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukherjee, amongst many others.We follow the making of the fictional movie from start to end, and even then, there is but only two prominent musical numbers which arise from that fictional movie alone, one of which we get to see Hrithik Roshan showcase his slick moves in a big top number. The second half of the film might have sagged a little as more attention was placed to the three way romance between Vikram, Nikki (check out that seduction scene that seems to have taken a leaf out of Russian Dolls) and Sona, and how success can get into one's head and the transformation from humbleness to jerk. Farhan Akhtar gives an excellent performance as the boy who innocently, then manipulative worked the system to his selfish advantage toward climbing the ladder of success, and the way it ended strongly in quite an unconventional way for a Bollywood movie, gives this film a certain gravitas in being unflinching in the messages it wants to make about the industry, where the tenacious succeed and there is not much room for sentimentalism.If you're looking for a jump point into what's on offer from Bollywood this year, then I would humbly suggest that Luck By Chance would be your best bet for an introduction to the wheelings, dealings and politicking behind the scenes by all players involved in getting the production complete, right down to generating buzz upon release, and how with luck, one's chances in life could be changed and transformed. Highly recommended." 
" Beauty as talent","A satire about Bollywood, and the struggle that young talent has in a nepotistic world, certainly sounds intriguing. But when the talent is mainly defined by beauty and ambition, it's hard to feel too sympathetic, particularly over the full course of what is a decidedly long film. In fact, satire is too strong a word here: although the inanity of Bollywood plots are gently ridiculed, the movie includes some song and dance sequences of its own (disguised as belonging to films within the film); and the eventual ending celebrates a character who fails to become a star, but nonetheless enjoys success as a leading television actress. Fundamentally, this not a story about real failure at any level, not one character is poor and not one young character is ugly, or indeed, even ordinary looking. A harsher, funnier tale might have been told." 
" The Inner Fabric of Bollywood","Intro : A look into the inner fabric of what we today know as Bollywood.The Scenario : The movie follows the trials and tribulations of two main characters (Farhan and Konkona) who are after the same goals - Bollywood Stardom. Along the way they come across a series of characters and personalities who form the crux of the industry. How much will one sacrifice of his/her principles and "person" to get ahead? What effect does rising stardom have on friends and family?Another well crafted parallel story line is the point of view of a troubled Producer (Rishi Kapoor) and obstacles he needs to go through to get a bunch of ego's and personalities together. (Like a Coalition Government!)The movie also gives us an insight into what goes behind the finished item - namely the unsung heroes in the industry. The music is pretty good and well placed in the film. Pros : The casting director should get credit here - actors, special appearances have been rock solid without being overdone. The levels of black humour are abundant. Konkona and Farhan have been in top form but Rishi Kapoor (the arch-typical Punjabi Bollywood producer) probably gets away with the top prize here. Watch out for the little cameo by Saurab Shukla (Slumdog M, Dasvidaniya) who sets the movie rolling in many ways.Cons : Perhaps the movie could have been a tad shorter but that may not be a problem if you're enjoying it. I know most people will not agree but despite being an improving and likable actor - Farhan's voice takes some getting used to. Well we got used to Rani M so it may not be that bad :)" 
" LUCK BY CHANCE: Beginner's Luck?","As a filmmaker (or perhaps a filmmaker-to-be), I often find myself thinking more about the process of film-making itself as opposed to what that process should be used to present. Such is the case with Zoya Akhtar's debut film, Luck By Chance. "Write what you know" they say and it feels that she's tried to do exactly that.Hot on the heels of the last Excel Productions film, Rock On!!, Luck By Chance marks the entry of the Farhan Akhtar's sister into the world of films and it's the world of films that she decides to deal with.And rather than offering us a soup or salad to whet or appetites, she gets right into things with a thali- full of delights.The set-up of the film is efficient and the title sequence is one of the most poignant tributes to Indian cinema that I've seen in some time. We instantly know that we will be covering a lot of ground. The plot-lines are many and varied: There's Sona Mishra's (Konkona Sen Sharma) struggle to become an established first tier heroine; there's Romy Rolly's (Rishi Kapoor) struggle to make a blockbuster film while balancing the airs of uppity celebrities; there's Zaffar Khan's (Hrithik Roshan) struggle to maintain some semblance of a normal life amidst extreme adulation and fame; there's Neena Wallia's (Dimple Kapadia) struggle to make sure her daughter follows in her footsteps and becomes a big star; and at the forefront is Vikram Jaisingh's (Farhan Akhtar) struggle to tie all of these plot lines together while he treats every other character as a rung on the ladder to the top.Most of the performances are top-notch. Rishi Kapoor is completely over-the-top, Dimple Kapadia is super scary and Hrithik Roshan stands out as the straight man amidst all the hijinks. Zoya Akhtar peppers the narrative with minor characters, many a celebrity character and observations on the nature of the industry. While these references are whizzing past with every scene, one minor complaint is that instead of being the perceptive views of an insider they pander to the clichés that one associates with Bollywood. But that's a relatively unimportant issue when we see how much is dealt with.It's a wonder that the script is able to handle all of these threads (and many more) to weave a rich tapestry of the "Hindi Film Industry". In spite of moments of confusion, we are treated to everything from the corporate side of Bollywood to the dedication of theatre actors to their muse. And while it's commendable that all of this manages to stay coherent, it does make us lose track of who or what we should be following.While Vikram's story seems to be the one we should be following, a second act turn makes us wonder what we are really invested in. And while this is an interesting approach, it isn't helped by the fact that the story begins to meander and almost reduces itself to a series of gags and oh-look-it's-so-and-so- celebrity situations. Rather than building to a resounding climax, it limps it's way across the finish line to an ending that is quite brave and down-to- earth but at the same time unexpected and a tad undeserved.In fact it's not very dissimilar to the trailer for the film. It starts as a light-hearted satire on today's Bollywood and descends into sentimentality and heavy-handedness. By trying to have the ostentatious song-and-dance sequence along with a certain cynicism, it balances along and uneven tone and one feels the Zoya Akhtar wants to have her cake and eat it too.Having said that, I do think it's a great first effort and there is just too much in this film to leave disappointed. It's great to see an intelligent voice shine through and hopefully once Ms. Akhtar achieves the catharsis she seems to desire, she moves beyond the realm of what she knows to what she wants to know.*** stars out of *****" 
" A must see for lovers of quality cinema","Every once in a while a film comes , which makes you wonder why there are not more of such ventures in Bollywood.Zoya Akhtar's directorial debut "Luck by Chance" is one such movie , where , by careful viewing ( especially the second time ) , I realize that every dialogue , every scene and almost every expression of the actors is well thought of and executed.I have seen the movie twice in theaters and am now watching it on the DVD , and am dumbstruck by the performances of the lead cast. Special mention here must be made about Konkana . She is absolutely marvelous in this movie . I know she is a natural performer , but in this movie , she does it with effortless ease , while knowing that this is a mainstream movie. Farhan Akhtar , in his second film , as an actor , proves yet again that he is such a gifted person. What a compelling performance.I must say that the characterization is one of the high points of this enterprise. Not a single character is half-baked, which is a rare feat in movies . Rishi Kapoor and Dimple show off their histrionics and take you by surprise .Watch this movie , and am sure you will relate to a few situations and characters completely. One of the best movies of 2009 , so far." 
" Bollywood Calling, with Dreams and Destiny","There is a fleeting scene in Zoya Akhtar's remarkable new film Luck By Chance where an aspiring, struggling young actor Vikram (Farhan Akhtar) nervously enters a big budget movie premiere party. His friend who is an assistant director in Mahesh Bhatt studio has taken him along as return of a favor. Place is bustling with actors, directors, writers, big shots, and crackerjacks of film industry we reckon. He starts walking the noisy venue. Camera starts following him in commotion and calms down somehow, now fluidly capturing Vikram's point of view which is nothing less than surreal. He seems gliding though the glamorous starry room checking artists, celebrities in flesh chatting, giving interviews, drinking, cracking up from touching distance. There is something deliberately dreamy about this shot. Director has given the protagonist his moment. This is what he is aiming at." 
" You make your own destiny(Kissmat banaye jaata hain!)","Zoya Akhtar's directorial debut Luck By Chance is an insider look to the current generation Hindi film industry. Its a story of two persons, both struggling to become actors and make it big in the industry. It shows how ones fortune is favored when the other fades away into nothingness. The film is of a languid pace, but you aren't ever bothered by it due to abundant platter of colorful characters. Be it Romi Rolly(portrayed brilliantly by veteran Rishi Kapoor) or the ex silver screen siren, Neena Wallia(an amazing portrayal by Dimple Kapadia).There are brilliant small cameo performances by the whos who of the industry, starting from Amir Khan to Karan Johar to Abhishek Bachchan to Shahrukh Khan. The film is a through entertainer, and even though the subject sometimes turns to the dark side of the film industry, the mood is kept light at all times by the quirky dialogs of the funny characters. The entire Rolly family for example is a bag of jokes. Veteran film producer Romi Rolly, played by Rishi Kapoor gives an enthralling and amazing performance putting a lasting memory to the character. Ranjit Rolly, the brother of producer Romi Rolly, played by Sanjay Kapoor, as the failed actor turned director, who is always making funny jokes and moves trying to convince himself and his crew about the next shot. Minty Rolly, the wife of Romi, played by Juhi Chawla is also a character to remember, as the superstitious wife. Mention has to be made of Hrithik Roshan whose small but astounding performance, as the superstar Zafar Khan, is too good to miss out. A lot of other small cameos by Anurag Kashyap, as the screenplay writer who plagiarizes Hollywood films from the DVDs to convince himself as one of the best in the business, Isha Shravani as the superstar daughter, who is too dumb and too pretty. Arjun Mathur, as the childhood friend of Vikram, also an aspirant actor is also brilliant. And lastly Dimple Kapadia as the ex- screen siren who is attempting to launch her daughter into super stardom.The main protagonists of the movie, Farhan Akhtar and Konkona Sen Sharma have also been explicitly brilliant. Farhan Akhtar, gives a measured performance who "seemingly" uses every step in his way to reach to the top of the rung of the Bollywood ladder of fame. Konkona Sen Sharma, is brilliant as the aspirant actress who fails to make it big time, but instead helps giving Vikram JaiSingh,(Farhan Akhtar) the big break into the showbiz. The songs performed the the trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is yet again a brilliant piece of job. The few number of songs in the movie, seems adequate and never forced. Luck By Chance is that rare piece among Hindi films, which you will treasure for long and is worth a second see. It is a heartwarming experience for everybody. an impressive achievement at writing and direction, Luck By Chance is full of moments filled with sharp and witty humor. An 8/10 for Zoya Akhtar's Luck By Chance." 
" A Must Watch and should be rated more than 10/10","Nothing else to say, except for mind blowing, wonderful, excellent and great. The best thing in the movie were the Dialogues, Javed Akhtar proved that he can still write Dialogues that can bowl out all the writers of Bollywood. Secondly, the screenplay and the Direction was brilliant and didn't seem like a directional debut of Zoya Akhtar. The story was okay, and was shown in many movies before, but the things that make the movie special are Dialogues, direction, great acting and most importantly the music. Shankar Ehsaan Loy gave an award winning music for this movie. Acting by Farhan Akhtar was okay, Hrithik was good, Rishi Kapoor was the best. The movie had everything you can expect from a Bollywood Movie. The Dialogues leave you thinking, and also give birth to new questions. But the main thing is if you understand the meaning of what Javed Akhtar was trying to explain, it will completely change your life and will finish the confusion between hard work and luck.Excellent Movie, Deserves to be the best film of the year!"
