" Slow-paced but good enough","The film is slow-paced, but overall it's a good one with a strong emotional quotient. Though it could have been made much better. The music is not commercially viable, but the songs do fit in the narrative. The film once again shows that Bobby Deol is a talented actor. But he is still ignored and highly under-rated. His potentials are not tapped enough by high-profile film-makers. Dwij Yadav excels yet again. Bobby Deol's and Dwij Yadav's chemistry is once again visible after Nanhe Jaisalmer. Kangna Ranaut does not have much to do in the movie. She fits better in the Bhatt's camp! Mohnish Behl gave a good account of himself. We should see more of his humble and nice roles in movies." 
" Good emotional well made movie","Watched this movie recently. I really loved it. Yes there are many loopholes but it is definitely high in emotions. Bobby Deol is amazing as Duke Chawla. Camaredie between Roshan and Duke is highlight of the movie. This movie is strictly one time watch but you will keep a smile after watching this movie. Music is ok but there freshness.
Such movies are better than idiotic Sallamn Khan or Shahrukh Khan movies" 
" Lacks the emotional depth and logic.","Samir Karnik's latest venture "Vaada Raha" walks on the same path of partly good movies as seen in his earlier projects such as "Nanhe Jaisalmer" & "Heroes". Selecting a fresh emotional subject for a film is as easy as reading a new story book. But transforming the same story into a worth watching movie is quite a different game altogether. This time too, Samir comes with a novel plot inspired by a Russian story based on the relationships between two patients in a hospital. But as experienced before, he again struggles in converting the emotional storyline into an equally transforming movie.Commencing with a slow start, the main hospital plot gets into the picture after quite a while. Until then, the viewer helplessly keeps trying to guess the real catch of the story, which actually revolves around a well known doctor (Bobby Deol), who accidentally reaches the hospital bed after a deadly road mishap. Completely paralyzed after the accident, he is not able to move any part of the body other than his face and also gets dumped by his fiancée (Kangna Ranaut) due to his current dependent state. But the real plot starts later on, when a small boy (Dwij Yadav), who is also there in the hospital, becomes the new friend of the doctor and motivates him to fight with his own destiny with a newly found courage and inner strength.The plot had a great potential for an off-beat kind of movie, close to the genre of "Anand" and "Mili". But in order to make it commercially viable, the director goes on to add un-necessary songs into the narration and also comes up with a highly unethical climax where Bobby again reunites with her selfish fiancée who left him alone at the most inappropriate time of his life, when she was needed the most. Moreover, the main focus of the movie, moving around the relationship between Bobby & Dwij Yadav, also fails to impress the viewer completely. Dwij has a great confidence and that may be the reason why Samir keeps on repeating him in his movies. But in "Vaada Raha" he is made to act more than his age, speaking such mature dialogues, suggesting that he is more intelligent than all the other grown-ups roaming around in the hospital as doctors and nurses. Though he has acted well, but I think a more soft spoken tone in his dialogues could have connected with the audience better.Bobby Deol, tries his level best and gives a good performance. But he gets many half-heartedly written scenes, where he suddenly starts walking after a severe paralysis attack, can easily facilitate a life saving operation dictating the doctors from T.V. monitors, reaches a quick conclusion on cancer cure after studying only a few books and goes on to marry the same girl who ditched him big time. According to the writers he is nothing short of a miraculous personality in medical profession. Kangna Ranaut and her talent is simply wasted in an insignificant role. Mohnish Behl is OK and so are the other character artists playing their small parts. Cinematography is just fine but music has nothing great to offer and comes up with only one song reaching the above average level.Comprising very few worth mentioning scenes (like the ones featuring the pet dog), "Vaada Raha" falters mainly in its writing department. The child factor and his trauma are not used so impressively into the script. The emotional sequences and the tragedies are unable to touch you deep inside. As a result the movie keeps on floating on the surface and fails to leave a heartwarming effect on the viewer. You can watch it only if you are tired of watching the usual love stories, underworld flicks and murder mysteries." 
" Half-Baked!","Samir Karnik is a good storyteller, barring his debut disaster 'Kyun, Ho Gaya Na'?, he has churned out good enough films over the time, with 'Heroes' being named as a classic. However, he takes a backseat with his latest outing 'Vaada Raha... I Promise'. The problem clearly lies in it's writing.'Vaada Raha' is all about Hope and Believe. Bobby stars as Duke, who's life today can be called gratifying. Everything works on his advantage. But in a unfortunate accident, he loses everything, be it physically & mentally. He becomes a negative pile, until, a kid enters his life and returns him what he had lost - HOPE.'Vaada Raha' has it's share moments, and a power-packed performance by Bobby, but overall, this comes out as a half-baked venture. The film begins well, but becomes a bore in the most vital moments, it's culmination. It's far from being touchy, it in fact is depressing.Samir Karnik's interest in the story gets lost in the middle. Karnik's direction is not great either. Binod Pradhan's Cinematography is decent. Songs are another sore point.What stands tall in 'Vaada Raha' is undoubtedly, Bobby's power-packed performance. The actor is flawless and the life of the show. In other performances, Kangana Ranaut, in a guest appearance, doesn't get much to do. She looks angelic, though. Dwij Yadav as Roshan, is okay. Mohnish Behl is passable. Sharat Saxena hams.On the whole, watch this one for Bobby's work, as that's the only substantial plus in this film!" 
" This is a boring movie","Vaada Raha, directed by Samir Karnik is a cheesy, emotionally manipulative, sob-saga that doesn't even deserve a straight-to-television release. Bobby Deol plays genius surgeon Duke Chawla, who becomes paralysed neck down in a road accident, and is subsequently dumped by his fiancée (played by Kangana Ranaut), for a reason so bizarre, you have to see it to believe it. Languishing in a hospital, angry and overcome with despair, he at first rejects the overtures of friendly kid Roshan (played by Dwij Yadav), the resident smart-alec in the place. The little tyke, however, wins our hero's affections and motivates him to recover speedily, even as the boy succumbs to his own fatal condition eventually, which he's always kept hidden from Duke. Sickeningly sentimental, Vaada Raha is full of logical loopholes and is directed with a loose hand by Karnik, who gives us some of the most ridiculous scenes you can think of, including one in which Duke tries to end his life by chewing his IV tubes, and another one in which he supervises a heart surgery from his hospital bed. The film is packed with silly stereotypes like faithful dog who won't eat till his master does, cheery hospital staff straight out of a Sooraj Barjatya film, and happy patients who don't seem to ever want to leave the hospital at all. Bobby Deol is woefully out of his depth here, failing to arouse any sympathy for his character, not least because he repeats his three stock expressions in every other scene. And we thought it was his lower-body that he couldn't move! Child actor Dwij Yadav, who starred in Karnik's Nanhe Jaisalmer and Heroes previously, has an engaging presence, but trapped in a one-dimensional role here, he gets annoying as the precocious brat. The blame for this rotten film, however, must be placed squarely on the shoulders of director Samir Karnik who has no concern for even basic details like the geography of his story. The film's opening-credits sequence in which Bobby cycles down a promenade against an azure blue sea looks like it's been shot in the South of France; there's a subsequent cut-away of New York's Times Square when Bobby and his doctor buddies hit a nightclub for drinks; an exterior shot of Kangana's home, in a scene in which he drops her off before his accident, appears to be filmed in a Mumbai shanty; and then Subhash Ghai's Whistling Woods Film School stands in for the hospital where Bobby recovers. Call it nitpicking if you like, but attention to detail is but one of Karnik's many shortcomings in this lousy, lousy film. Since they were there anyway, it might have been a good idea for the filmmaker and his leading man to take refresher courses during lunch break while shooting at Whistling Woods. Do yourself a favour. Don't even bother with this one."
