" A movie with a lot of emotions. Good performances from the main characters. Good entertainment","The main purpose of the cinema is to entertain.Entertainment can mean different things to different people.Normally we expect a lot of emotion in Indian movies.If emotion makes you feel like throwing up, you should not really be watching Indian Hindi movies.If you are really taken with realism, watch a documentary. If you want to get away from the mundane affairs of everyday life watch a Hindi movie.Veer Zaara is a Hindi movie with lots of emotion. The audience identify with the characters and go back to watching it again and again.One must realise that a movie is a hit only when the audience is able to identify themselves with the characters.Questions do come to mind. Like, how did Rani Mukherjee know Veer's name? Maybe Yash Chopra made a mistake. The mistake did not cost him anything because the movie succeeded at the box-office.It might also have taken too long a time to give an explanation.And the movie is already 192 minutes long. A flaw nevertheless, but then you can find faults with just about everything. If you have negative vibes about the person playing the principal character in a movie, you really should not be watching the movie in the first place. SRK has become a living legend.He is a good actor. He has done well as the young squadron leader as well as the ageing prisoner. Twenty two years in jail can age a man beyond his years. Shahrukh was convincing.Preity was her usual bubbly self initially, and then equally convincing.The movie was fast paced.Editing was good. No where did it drag.The songs were excellent." 
" great entertainment","Often it's the much-anticipated films that disappoint the most, but Veer Zaara lives up to the pre-release hype. Just when you think you know where the story is going, you are pleasantly surprised and therefore enthralled as the story unveils.People either love SRK or hate him, but I think he delivers what is necessary for this role without going over the top.The surprise appearances are great, and Priety Zinta is getting better with every role.Last, but certainly not least, the music is superb. If you have no other reason to see this movie, see it to know the story that was finally told with these beautiful songs.10 out of 10" 
" Humanity, respect and the power of love against time and circumstances","Yash Chopra's Veer-Zaara is a film about humanity, devotion, sacrifice, and the power of love. It is a visually stunning and emotionally touching picture about star-crossed lovers who meet once and are tied forever. Yash Chopra artistically combines realism with greatly unrestrained emotion and some overdone sentimentality. Although the love story itself, the separation and everything else is very typical, Chopra creates an entirely different film in the way it portrays the respect the lovers have for each other, the honour they pay to parents and elders, and their genuine willingness to sacrifice themselves for each other. It is a cross-border love story between an Indian and a Pakistani, yet their nationality is not what prevents them from being together. That's what really makes sense in this film. It flows very well through the stunning views of Indian and Pakistani fields and groves, and colourfully shows the bright sides of each country. The film does look a bit dated, but then it does not have a defined period of historical time, which makes it an all-time saga.The film also addresses women's empowerment through Rani Mukherjee's role of a Pakistani lawyer who tries to overcome society. There are many surprising and touching moments in the film. The love story is portrayed grandiosely, with larger-than-life orchestral music of heavy violins and piano. The movie soundtrack is perhaps the most beautiful soundtrack in recent years, and the fact that it was actually composed many years ago contributes to the epic mood of the film. Shahrukh Khan and Preity Zinta are great choices for the film. They resuscitate their characters with restraint and dignity and have a credible chemistry despite not having much physical interaction. Khan is the main soul of the film and he is believable in everything his character goes through. Zinta is beautiful and compelling as the intelligent and headstrong Zaara, and looks great in traditional outfits. Rani Mukhejee makes a great impact with her relatively minor but pivotal role of the tenacious, level-headed Saammiya. She is natural and impressive and leaves the film as a winner.Veer-Zaara, though a completely entertaining epic romance, is not the greatest film you'll see and it often goes over-the-top in its emotions. It is far from being flawless and has its share of loopholes where script is concerned. Having said that, it just doesn't matter here. This film is far ahead of anything it can be blamed for. It is about the main values a person should cherish in life: humanity, respect and love, and it conveys this message very well. It is one of those films which become classics instantly, and I recommend it to anyone, whoever and wherever he is."

" Progressive Film","Reviewed by: Vijay Venkataramanan Reviewer's Rating: 9 out of 10It's Diwali - the time for sweets, new clothes, fireworks, and as is customary every year in India, a star-studded, feel-good blockbuster. Yash Chopra's reclamation of the director's throne after seven long years is a simple return to the classical traditions of mainstream Indian film-making. The flair and sensitivity for romance is intact along with the passion for deep-rooted cultural and traditional mis-en-scene. However, neither is "Veer Zaara" a classic, nor is it even remotely comparable to Chopra's earlier masterpieces such as "Silsila", "Kaala Pathar", "Kabhie Kabhie", and "Lamhe". Yet, it is an ideal Diwali gift, exquisitely packaged, filled to the brim with sentiments and emotions, presented with only the best of intentions.Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) has been decaying in a Pakistani prison for twenty-two years. Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukherjee), a local lawyer representing the Human Rights Commission undertakes the challenge of fighting for Veer so he can return to India. As Saamiya tries to unearth the hidden truth behind why and how Veer ended up in this situation, we are taken through a trip down memory lane as Veer recollects the days when he found and lost the love of his life, a Pakistani girl called Zaara (Priety Zinta).What "Veer Zaara" lacks in terms of an innovative plot structure, it more than makes up for with Aditya Chopra's sometimes flawed, but sensitive writing. The supporting characters are extremely well fleshed out, and his dialogs witty and subtle. The storytelling is further enhanced with Javed Akhtar's lyrical wizardry, and Yash Chopra's tact for stretching defining moments of the story into musical interludes continues to fascinate. "Do pal ruka, khwaabon ka kaarvaan", a fine example of Mr. Akhtar's and Mr. Chopra's brilliance remains etched in your memory.The film's grand-scale packaging is embellished by Sharmishta Roy's artistic, and exquisitely detailed production design, with each set being highly reflective of the characters that it holds in. Cinematographer Anil Sharma (Lagaan, Kal Ho Na Ho) sets up a rustic, yet opulent scheme to the film's largely rural setting that brings back memories of the evergreen "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge".Actors including the great Amitabh Bachchan (who makes a stunning special appearance in this film with Hema Malini) have always elevated their performances to higher levels under Yash Chopra's baton. Rani Mukherjee follows in the same footsteps, playing the rookie lawyer with an admirable juxtaposition of nervousness and ferocity. While Preity Zinta and Shahrukh Khan too perform well in their respective roles, at no point does one feel that these two talented actors are ever challenged with roles such as these. Having played the loverboy so many times in the past, Veer Pratap Singh is a cakewalk for the Khan. The lead pair's chemistry from their younger days all the way to the days of their fifties is highly appreciable however. The supporting cast comprising of Divya Dutta, Kirron Kher, Boman Irani, and Manoj Bajpai make full use of their well-defined characters to enact high-caliber performances.Other than the story of two fanatically devoted lovers, "Veer Zaara" is a progressive film for the Indian Film Industry because it makes an effort to break stereotypes with respect to Indo-Pak relations. It is a welcome change from the mindless Pak-bashing fare that we are routinely subjected to. Sensitive approaches like this first of all would help improve cultural ties, considering Hindi movies do comprise of a large portion of India's unofficial exports to Pakistan. Equally important is the economic factor because a culturally sensitive film like "Veer Zaara" is bound to officially open up a potentially huge, untapped, cinema-going audience across the border" 
" Bollywood Entertainment",""Veer-Zaara" was shown as part of an international film series at my local public library. It is the first Bollywood musical I have ever seen, and as such, I lack the critical perspective necessary to make an informed judgement about it. However, I did rate "Veer-Zaara" seven out of ten, because I found it consistently entertaining, and often entirely delightful. I was never once bored - in spite of its three hour plus running time. In order to appreciate any form of musical drama, it's necessary to "surrender" to theatrical artifice, and seen in that light, "Veer-Zaara" is no more illogical or "unrealistic" than a classic Vincent Minnelli Musical or a "serious" Verdi opera. I was also very intrigued at the way that the plot of the film crossed several genres and combined a number of classic story-telling archetypes: "the star-crossed lovers," "the village pastorale," "the saga of family honor," "the courtroom drama," etc.Watching this film I think I learned a lot about modern Indian culture. Although at times the sentimentality in "Veer-Zaara" is so gushing that it enters into the realm of camp, there is also much substance in the film which is entirely admirable and worthy of esteem: the honor paid to parents and elders, the independence and spirit shown by strong and intelligent women, the respect given to Law and Justice, and perhaps most importantly, the possibility of peace and reconciliation between two peoples and two nations who have been engaged in a long, bitter, and fruitless quarrel." 
" Fantabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","It was a really spectacular movie! I think the cinematography, music, colour, acting and 'second to none' story were instrumental in it being, I am sure, one of the best of its time. "Hats off" to Chopra and his team for directing yet another masterpiece! I must have this on DVD to add to my aspiring collection of movies. I couldn't believe that the movie did not waste time, with the usual 'Tun Tun' characters, which I must say, are displayed really well sometimes. The movie progressed smoothly, from one Scene to the next backed by superb and riveting music. I saw the movie this weekend (couldn't go before due to Diwali and Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations) and will return to the cinema this coming weekend to view it yet again! I think the movie had a 'Dilwale....' kind of feeling to it linked, perhaps, to the rural, peasant farming, outdoor field type of setting. I was truly pleased to see a movie linked to the India/Pakistan conflict, to be devoid of fighting and bloodshed! The movie addressed some of the more delicate issues of this conflict and must say that it was done in the most professional way!....Great movie....I give it five(5) stars!" 
" Thank you Mr Chopra","I am one of those fussy people who watches selected films. Most films bore me because either they are a re-make (old Indian or American)or the story just does not grab me. I went to see this film after a very long time at the cinema and within the first five minutes, I told me husband what I thought the story would be and I was so shocked to find that the films story was not what I had predicted. I also hate films were the lovers have to die in the end (as they did in "Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak), because I truly believe that true love can conquer all.Yash Chopra has, as always, delivered an all-round entertainer. The songs were mesmerising; Madan Mohans' tunes were beautiful, Lata Mangeshkars voice was 'an out of this world' experience, Javed Akhtars' lyrics and Aditya Chopras' poem meant so much to those who understand them.Photography was enchanting; such films make people like me who love India, love it even more.The acting was par excellence, Shahrukh Khan did not disappoint at all, Preity Zinta was the essence of beauty and innocence and Rani was good as well.I would just like to say thank you to Mr Chopra for a wonderful experience." 
" A surprise top movie!","I was fully prepared to see a typical Bollywood romantic musical, but came blow away at the sheer awesomeness of this movie! Yes, it is a romantic musical with great music, but the underlying themes are so much more keeping you engaged during the entire movie. Be prepared to see a sense romance, courage, honor and humanity that will heighten your senses. You will feel love, spirituality, anger, sadness and happiness all throughout. The scenery is beautiful and the actors all play their roles well. Veer's speech in court towards the end is something that will be remembered as it should be a basis of all humanity's dealings with differences. It is awesome in a world filled with hatred towards differences that a story like this can rise above and see the common thread in all humanity. A must see, even if you don't enjoy romantic musicals" 
" A beautiful epic love story from Yash Chopra!","The Chopras have proved once again that you can always count on them to provide the highest quality cinema. I'd first like to applaud Shahrukh for outdoing himself once again by playing both a young, simple-natured squadron and an old, tormented prisoner so convincingly. His skillful subtleties and attention to each detail of his performance have undoubtedly turned him to the best actor I have ever seen. I think he has even surpassed Amitabh. Even though Rani and Preity's roles didn't seem to demand too much from them, they gave a wonderful performance. Even Manoj Bajpai did an excellent job. The story is fabulous. Where the traditional Bollywood film could take the same situations with different outcomes for each event to turn the film into the same familiar fare, Veer-Zaara makes turns it into an epic love story where Veer and Zaara's names can be added to the list of Devdas and Paro, Shah Jahaan and Mumtaaz, etc. The main minus point of the film is its music. Warning: Don't listen to the music before watching the film or it will sound horrendous! Tere Liye, however, is extremely beautiful and melodic. After watching the movie, Aisa Des Hai Mera and Main Yahan Hoon are quite likable. Unfortunately, the latter two are not ones that one can keep humming for several months. Another minor yet negligible drawback is that this movie can't appeal as much to the youth as Yash Chopra's previous film, Dil to Pagal Hai. An addicting soundtrack and a youthful appeal were two things that seemed to be missing, which are usually guaranteed in every Chopra extravaganza. Nonetheless, Veer-Zaara is fantastic!" 
" Emotionally powerful one that never loses its focus !","7 years ago, the veteran director Yash Chopra directed Shah Rukh Khan in a love triangle based movie Dil Toh Pagal Hain. After a long span of time, he came back with his highly acclaimed endeavor Veer Zaara. Not only an outstanding movie but a totally stand-out movie. The film stars Shah Rukh khan, Preity Zinta & Rani Mukherjee playing the lead roles while actors like Anupam Kher, Kirron Kher, Boman Irani comes under the supporting cast. Kudos to legends Amitabh Bachchan & Hema Malini for their cameos. The movie is set under the backdrop of enmity between India and Pakistan and the way it affects the lives of two lovers. A very old and weak Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh ( Shah Rukh Khan) has spend 22 years of his life in Lahore jail situated in Pakistan abandoning his freedom and happiness only for the sake of his love Zaara's happiness (Preity Zinta). A ray of hope rises in his life when rookie lawyer Samiya ( Rani) comes for the sheer reason of opening Veer's case again in the court. Major part of the film is Veer's narration of his love story to Samiya. Scenes , dialogs and Artistic direction add up to the beauty of the film. Chopra redefines the true meaning of love through this brilliance Veer Zaara. The shots taken through Punjab and Lahore are so eye-catchy and refreshing. Yash Chopra takes u on a ride in fields of Punjab, the pinds of Lahore, the snow capped mountains that charms you in every way possible. Songs touch your heart deeply. Valuable contributions by singers Lata mangeshkar, Sonu Nigam, Udit Narayan, Roop Kumar rathod, Gurudas Mann have made songs so pure and full of good-will that u literally feel the emotion in your heart. Veer Zaara will never disappoint you. Watch it for the nth time and you tend to rediscover the pure saga of love." 
" A masterpiece of film making!","The summary says it all: this film is a masterpiece from one of the greatest directors of our time! The cinematography is simply stunning. The performances are all tremendously inspired. (Thanks to Yash Chopra)The love story heart-warming, touching and deeply moving. There is also wisdom in the movie. For example, we get the mystical explanation of the number '786' in Islam and Sufism. The music is marvelous and the script brilliant.I could go on and on, but, simply put, the movie is riveting from beginning to end. Upon my first viewing I thought it to be in the class of films such as 'Lagaan' and 'Fiza'. But, upon seeing the movie 2 more times, I believe it is even better than those two fine films.Veer-Zaarait's my tribute to the oneness of people on both sides of the border." - Yash Chopra" 
" "Gift of the Magi" in Bollywood format","SOME SPOILERS: As some other reviewers have commented, this movie is like grand opera. That does not bother me at all--it is what I expect from Bollywood musicals of the grand, traditional type. (Better grand opera than fifth-rate-MTV cheeze.) I also wasn't especially bothered by some of the implausibility of the plot: I did think SRK's Veer was a bit too doddering for a man who is theoretically only in his early fifties, 22 years in prison or not. On the other hand, it didn't bother me that Saamiya knew his name. He had given his interrogators his name before he decided on silence, and presumably that name was in his files.What some might consider a major, major flaw (or at least deeply disappointing) is the basic premise. After Veer sacrifices himself to save Zaara's honor, she throws her honor away. What is Veer's sacrifice for, if she doesn't marry and have children, if her family is destroyed anyway? But--whether intentional or not--this is what makes the movie interesting to me, because the pointless sacrifice is mutual."Veer-Zaara" is like a Bollywood version of the old O. Henry story, "The Gift of the Magi," which focuses on a young married couple who are very much in love. They are poor, and have only two possessions of value: she has her long, lovely hair and he has a beautiful pocket watch. Each wishes to surprise the other with a Christmas present that will reflect the depth of their love for one another. So what do they do? She sells her lovely hair to buy him a chain for his watch, and he sells his watch to buy her an ornamental comb for her hair. The mutual sacrifices cancel each other out, and are meant to ironically underline the over-the-top foolishness of their love for each other.How much more pointless is it that Veer sacrifices 22 years of his life to save the honor of Zaara and her family, while Zaara sacrifices her honor and family in order to live Veer's life? I think the pointlessness of the sacrifice (that they cancel each other out) is deliberate, though, because we see it through the eyes of Saamiya, who says, "What century do these people live in? Are they human beings pretending to be gods or gods disguised as human beings?" It is up to each viewer to decide whether the sacrifices of Veer and Zaara are noble and romantic, or foolishly romantic.The only problem I have with the basic premise is that Veer's choice is presented as either/or: Either he explains what he is really doing in Lahore and ruins Zaara, or he sacrifices himself. But what if he had said that Zaara's mother had sent for him, because she wanted to meet the man who had saved her daughter's life? Ideally, the screenplay would have allowed for such a choice, and found a way to close the door on it. This was not a great flaw for me, though, because Veer is not behaving like an intelligent young man capable of outwitting his captors. He has, after all, come to Pakistan in a state of mind where he is ready and willing, and even eager, to immolate himself on the altar of love.The movie itself is beautifully filmed. There isn't much going on apart from the love story, but sometimes a grand over-the-top romance is worth watching. I did not find SRK embarrassing, as I sometimes did in "Kal Ho Naa Ho." He was very good, as was Zinta as a slightly spoiled girl who begins showing her actual determination and nobility of spirit and as soon as she is tested by her nanny's death. And I found all the cast up to their roles, especially Rani Mukherji. I didn't even know, when I first saw the film, that Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini were going to be in it. How delighted I was when I saw that they were! And how cleverly their roles in the film were designed: they are living the happy ending that Veer and Zaara will step into after they return to the village." 
" First time a movie which has combined patriotism, emotions, love, respect and humanity.","I have been a movie buff since I was a kid. Been watching a lot of movies. After watching Veer Zaara now I can say that my way of watching a movie had been divided into two parts. Pre Veer Zaara and Post veer Zaara.I have never seen a movie which combines a message of patriotism, emotions, respect, love and humanity with touching songs and wholesome entertainment. Until I saw Veer Zaara, I thought of Yashji as a very good movie maker. After Veer Zaara, I think he is not just a good movie maker but also a very good human being. Only a man with a heart of gold can make such a beautiful movie.Excellent direction, great acting, touching dialogues, melodious songs, brilliant cinematography, awesome locations what more I can say about the movie. It is a citizen Kane of India. Hats off to Yashji" 
" THE BEST FILM OF 2004 PERIOD","I have become quite a fan of Indian Hindi films in the last few years and my favorites have been Devdas, Lagaan, Baghban, Dil Chahta Hai among others. I have seen Veer Zaara three times in the theatre and must say that it is without a doubt the BEST BOLLYWOOD FILM I have ever seen. The score, direction, story and acting are superb. For a movie that lasts almost 3 1/2 hours, the story is so involving that the time just wizzes by. I have taken friends, not attuned to Bollywood style films and they were as thrilled as I was. This is in my opinion the BEST FILM of 2004 period. The speech Shah Rukh Kahn gives in the courtroom at the end of the film which pleas for tolerance and understanding raises the entire movie to a rarified plane. It would have been easy to end the story at the end of the trial but Yash Chopra and his writers enter an exalted level with this scene. Please be warned that this moving film is a real tear-jerker! It is a shame that main stream American movie reviewers are ignoring the film which is apparently doing very well in England and Australia. I could not find a review of this movie in any newspaper in Chicago on a recent trip. Even though I personally left a message for the reviewer of the Detroit Free Press, he chose to ignore the film entirely. Perhaps the people promoting the movie and Indian films in general need to do some homework and try to get their movies reviewed. It is a shame that many people who rely on critics reviews before seeing a film will not even know about this fabulous movie. It should at least be nominated for Oscar BEST FOREIGN FILM of 2004."
