" Nah! not that good","I remember a film named Julie was a flop, but it gave rise to a star in music direction, Rajesh Roshan. Similarly, this movie too showcases a talented actor Nikhil Dwiwedi, who gets well in the role of Anthony Gonsalves.This is the story of Anthony, a bartender working in a bar, and an orphan, raised by Father of a church (played by Mithun Chakravarty). He has a dream of acting in a movie. He gives an audition and bags the role amidst tough competition. There, he meets the assistant director of the movie (Amrita Rao) and falls in love with her.He has a godfather in underworld who he has witnessed in a crime. The plot thickens, with police after Anthony to become a witness, which he doesn't want to, because he loves his godfather, and the gang lord, for whom his godfather works wants Anthony dead.The plot is okay, but a bit typical for Hindi movies. The songs are okay, with Himesh Reshammiya merging his sounds with Pritam, which sounds good in "Tum Mile" and Pritam does a good job in "Allah Beli".Amrita Rao is a good actress, but her scope in this movie is not enough.Pawan Malhotra as the godfather is impressive and so is Anupam Kher as a gang lord. He looks dangerous.Bottom line: Timepass movie, better rent the DVD than going to the theater." 
" This Anthony has a long way to go!","E Niwas's 'My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves' is average entertainer, which tanked at the box office. The film is just about okay.Performance Wise: Nikhil Diwedi makes a pretty good debut. He's good and surely has a future in Bollywood. Amrita Rao gets a which role offers her nothing. Mithunda is superb as the father. Anupam Kher is classy. Pawan Malhotra is terrific. Mukesh Tiwari and Dayashankar Pandey are good. Javed Shiekh needs a lot of grooming. Saurabh Shukla is first-rate. Anil Kapoor in a cameo appearance in energetic, Priyanka Chopra looks hot in a cameo too.'My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves' is a strictly one-time watch." 
" Unexpected pleasure","Not often I get to watch a movie knowing nothing about it, MNIAG was one of those. And what a treat it turned out to be. After the tear-jerking, heartrending glop turned out in TZP, this was an unpretentious delight- nice acting by all concerned, simple story line (though a thoroughly gratuitous fight scene at the end) And that Amrita Rau- she is the spitting image of Emmanuelle Chirqui and equally bubbly! Just the right kind of movie to watch of a Sunday afternoon, no hamming and quite a pleasure to see Anupam Kher actually acting instead of hamming it up as he seems to have been forever since Saraansh.Yeah, all said and done I recommend MNIAG most heartily and am awfully surprised to see the rating of 5.2 or whatever it has. Must be a bunch of philistines who mistook the shameless emotional manipulation of TZP for real cinema!" 
" A good movie!","E. Nivas is really a very good director. We have seen his other films like "Shool" and "Love ke liye kuch bhi karega". Both these movies were good in their respective genre.About My name is Anthony: E Nivas is getting better with his each new movie. The story of Anthony a wannabe actor is told very nicely.Every Indian who loves Indian cinema, Amitabh Bachchan and good story will love this movie.The only negative point of the movie is its songs.The actors are best in their respective roles. Especially Pavan Malhotra and the newcomer Nikhil." 
" Very Boring.","This film about a young aspiring actor trying to break into Bollywood as a lead actor rather than work his way up is very boring and misguided. The acting is bad, the songs are even worse and the direction is laughable. It is such a shame to see that Amrita Rao is actually not leading actress material, she needs to be padded with great actors than herself to actually come out in a film.I recommend that you watch 'Luck By Chance' instead which has more substance and well written characters. Unless you're a fan of Anumpam Kher, Anil Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Amrita Rao or Hrishitaa Bhatt (all who guest star) avoid at all cost.D-"
