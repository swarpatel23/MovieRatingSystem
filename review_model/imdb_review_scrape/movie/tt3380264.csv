" Partly Entertaining, Partly Boring!","'Kill Dil' Directed by Shaad Ali has a brisk first-hour, but a bland & boring second, which acts as a deterrent. The Film is partly entertaining, partly boring! 'Kill Dil' Synopsis: Two killers – Tutu (Ali Zafar) and Dev (Ranveer Singh) were nurtured by Bhaiyaji (Govinda) who trained them to be sharp shooters. Things take an unexpected turn when Dev falls in love with Disha (Parineeti Chopra) and decides to leave his violent life. 'Kill Dil' begins on an awesome note & the bromance between its protagonists works big time. Its the romantic-track, that gets tedious in the latter hour. Even the climax looked hurried & unconvincing. Also, the excessive usage of songs in its first & second-hour, only drag the film pointlessly. The Screenplay isn't without merit, but it loses steam in the second-hour. A stronger second-hour was most certainly needed! The dialogue, however, are clever. Shaad Ali's Direction is average. Cinematography & Editing are superbly done. Music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is melodious, but the songs pop-up unnecessarily in the narrative.Performance-Wise: Ranveer Singh is in terrific form, yet again! The talented actor enacts the love-struck young-blood with enviable energy & conviction. Ali Zafar supports Ranveer, wonderfully. Parineeti Chopra looks gorgeous & delivers a fair performance. Govinda springs a pleasant surprise. He nails it as the villain. Among Others, Alok Nath is restrained in a cameo. On the whole, 'Kill Dil' is strictly a watchable fare, that's bogged down by a half-baked Screenplay." 
" It will kill you as it is loud, lousy and unconvincing","90's masala popcorn films are back thanks to movies like Wanted , Dabangg , Rowdy Rathore. Unfortunate part is that movies are getting repeated and outdone and the essence of the flavor is dying. Kill Dil tries hard to entertain you but falls flat on the face.Kill Dill tells the story of two orphans raised by a godfather who turns out to be hit-men. Things go wrong after one of them falls in love with a girl and leaves the gang to lead a peaceful and normal life away from guns and violence.From the director of Bunty aur Babli and Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, not much was expected from Shaad Ali. The lousy direction , insensible screenplay and terrible story gives you a headache which you never asked especially from stars like Parineeti Chopra, Renveer Singh and Govinda. There is no plot here and frequent insertion of songs just spoils the entire mood of the film. Music is a complete letdown. Art direction and cinematography is decent. Ranveer Singh and Parineeti Chopra disappoints big time. For the first time in their career , he does not do justice to his role. The veteran Govinda is wasted. Overall, Kill Dil is loud, lousy and unconvincing. Not recommended. 1/5https://www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk" 
" All four lead actors deliver the goods","I'm surprised by the many average reviews this film is getting, in part because: 1. although not strictly a comedy, it's funnier than many other Bollywood films this year 2. has at least three killer music tracks 3. all four leads more than deliver in their respective roles 4. it features the return of Govinda (and it's a great part) 5. Ali Zafar has finally proved (as he did in Tere Bin Laden before being typecast) that there's more to him that formulaic rom-coms 6. it doesn't rely on endless and pointless stunts to form the narrative as many recent blockbusters haveSure it's not perfect, the story has a familiarity to it (but what film doesn't these days?) and there are a couple of cringe-worthy moments; but I'd rather watch Kill Dil over again than many of the other half-baked 'blockbuster' efforts clocking up the rupee signs over the last 12 months.Do yourself a favour, ignore the reviews and go check it out for yourself- you might be pleasantly surprised." 
" A musical film, with no storyline, it's only Lyrical!","#KillDil : The star casts of this film is saying that this is a musical blockbuster. But, I am saying that it is a musical, not a blockbuster. Plus Point: Kkkk Kill Kill Dddd Dil Dil, Actually the entire music album, Ranveer Singh's madness, Funny dialogues of first half, Song's picturization, Some one liners & the best part of Kill/Dil is Govinda. Ali Zafar has been wasted. & For Parineeti, what can I say? She is loosing her fans with Daawat-E-Ishq & now Kill/Dil. Ranveer is capable to engage you and also capable to entertain you. Govinda as Bhaiyaaji is outstanding. He is back. On his one liners, public was shouting and cheering. The movie may be a hammer without him. Lyrics by Gulzar & Music by Shankar-Ehesan-Loy are the things which made the director-producers to make a film called Kill Dil. Seriously, there is no story line. Whatever it is, is lyrical. Every 10-15 minutes, one song came in front of you. Every song is watchable on the big screen. But, you are not want only songs, they have to show story in which they can put songs. But, here, the story is in somewhere, the empty spaces between any two songs. I found 2 mistakes of director. One is in the first scene, the guards of Netaji went where after the shootout. Second one is, in one scene, the mike's shadow is clearly visible on Ranveer's head. So it's called minus points. Overall, this movie offers you new Govinda and some new one liners or you can say good comedy. Other than these, nothing new can be seen by anyone. Yeah, it is called a one time watch." 
" Worth a watch","This may be just another old story packaged and presented anew..but, it is way better than the happy new year's or the ram Leela's. I enjoyed the movie from the word go. True, it had way too many songs and the second half crumbled..but shaad Ali has made a decent movie. It was a tribute to the Tarantino style of movie making..not a copy. Performance wise, the two actors that stood out..were govinda and Ali zafar. Ranveer singh was good but with Ali zafar sharing screen space, I wasn't able to focus on ranveer. His baritone, swag and expressions were superb. Govinda was fabulous as the menacing bhaiyyaji. Parineeti tried too hard. And it came through. Her roles was also written badly. The ending was terrible though. It was one of those mass pleasers and did not fit in with the rest of the twisted story. Ali zafar's character was suddenly reduced to a bungling idiot at the end. I still give this movie a 8..for me it was way way better than the illogical masala potboilers our directors keep churning out without an iota of creativity, story or fresh appeal." 
" Worth the watch, especially if you're a Ranveer fan!","With such a star cast, you can't blame anyone for going to watch this film with a lot of expectation. Even then you look at Shaad Ali's portfolio of work with Saathiya (hit), Bunty aur Babli (hit) and Jhoom Barabar Jhoom (super flop) and you wander whether there is a trend somewhere? Nevertheless, Kill Dil has you hooked at certain points, but lets you go in too many. The first half of the film is excellent - fast paced and at the intermission you kind of have a feeling of what is to come and you're pretty excited but the second hand drags and is the real let down. Also the numerous amount of songs put the film down majorly. It is like every 10 minutes they need to sing and dance - why?! Yes I understand the film is also a comedy and has romance, but some of the songs were neither appropriate or decent! Whilst Bollywood continues to do this, it will also be far far away from Hollywood. The comedy is though, at times brilliant! Ranveer is rib-tickling funny with his silly dialogues and mannerisms. Down to performances, and naturally as expected Ranveer Singh steals the show. The guy is fantastic and post Gunday, delivers yet another reputable role to his portfolio. Ali Zafar oozes class. He not only looks brilliant on screen with his long hair and beard, but brings that calm manner to the screen so well, while Ranveer is the energetic one. Their friendship on screen is shown very well and does remind of you of Jai Veeru in some ways. Parineeti Chopra looks a million dollars and plays her part with ease, however I think she needs to consider different types of roles that challenge her. Govinda is brilliant and it's good to see him back, albeit as a villain. I appreciate he was playing a Gangster, but there was no explanation into why he wanted to kill so many people?! The music of the film is okay, but not amazing. The title track, Sajde and Baawre are my favourites. The rest of the songs are average and picturised even worse. Overall Kill Dil is worth the watch for sure, and certainly go watch it for the performances, especially Ranveer's." 
" Comedy+painful script","Another Bollywood film that makes no sense at all. from comic angle to an extent first half may be a time pass for the people . but as the film progressed its harder to sustain such a boring film. could watch for one time if you are fan of actors then after watching u may regret some of the story and think about what you saw especially in the second half . do not regret if u missed the film wait a month and watch happily from your own couch on the T.V sets.Songs may be one time watchable probably you tube music videos may be sufficient enough. One word Comic mostly first half Painful boring narration in the latter parts." 
" Superb dialogs + super acting","What will you call a girl who pushes her father down ...Kill dill finally arrives. It arrived in style or not ? Well yes ! Story is routine. What makes it different is killer dialogs and brilliant acting by every one involved in the movie. I was skeptical about Govinda. But he delivered / looked / acted brilliantly. Hard to think some one else in his role and justifying it too. Movie completely belongs to Ranveer Singh. Guy is super actor and dashing. He and his partner in the movie "Ali Zafar" are here to stay. Parineeti Chopra is blunt and fits perfectly in the role. She is a good actress who blends both urban style and traditional Bollywood emotions. Only her voice could be a dampener in the long run just like Rani Mukherjee. Movie maintains its high constant pace. There are hardly any over the board emotional scenes or big typical Bollywood drama which keeps the audience engaging. With near-no dull moment, movie is expected to have decent success and could be seen twice.After Saathiya (2002), Bunty Aur Babli(2005), Jhoom Barabar Jhoom (2007) Kill Dill is likely to be Shaad Ali's best movie as a director. But seeing his background much more is expected from him. He has acted as assistant director with Maniratnam, so he can deliver surely. His earlier movies lacked the punch. Kill Dill fills this void perfectly.... Pushpa" 
" Kill Dill","From the first look of its promo, Kill Dill brought an implicit association with the Quentin Tarantino brand of pulp fiction - heroes in cool leather jackets and dark sunglasses, slow-mo gunshots against a pale-yellow textured template, sly humor, whistle score akin to cowboys genre and an undercurrent of gleeful violence that runs through the narrative.And with an interesting line-up of actors , it appeared as if director Shaadi Ali was in a serious attempt to resurrect his image after the disastrous Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.Despite a promising start and a premise ripe with potential,Kill Dill fizzes out like a con cracker.Set in the hinterland, somewhere in the Delhi-NCR suburbs, it tells the story of two friends, Dev(Ranveer Singh) and Tutu(Ali Zafar) who are raised by the grizzly don, Bhaiyaji(Govinda)when he finds these two orphans lying in a garbage dump , to become contract shooters.Without much of insights, we are given glimpses of the camaraderie between these two boys and their fetish for bullets and beer.Shaad establishes the fact they have a tough exterior but soft at heart.All is well till Dev falls in love with the vivacious Disha(Parineeti Chopra) who rehabilitates criminals for a career but is oblivious of Dev's tinted past.Conscience hits Dev and he decides to abandon the world of crime, which doesn't go well with Bhaiyaji.Should I go ahead with the plot? Well,its a pure cliché, which is churned into a cauldron of romance, ample naach-gaana,daru-shaaru and action.A lot of energy is infused by the flamboyant Ranveer who proves his mettle at comedy yet again with terrific one-liners.He is ably armed with the perky and piquant Parineeti who is effortless as far as the acting chops go , but crippled with outrageous styling and ill-sketched characterization.A series of SMS exchanges between the duo provides genuine 'LOL' moments.Equally noteworthy is the job interview sequence which lands Ranveer up in desperation to crack.Ali Zafar provides the balancing act here with his self-restrain while Govinda makes a praise-worthy comeback in a negative role.In fact, with the catchy soundtracks ( Shankar-Ehsaan- Loy)and the veteran's signature steps, it does manage to keep you in the groove.In spite of all these positives, Kill Dill is muddled with a hackneyed script and over-simplistic treatment which doesn't give any depth to the characters and you know you are tricked only when it ends abruptly , after running a little more than two hours.If you want to know my verdict, I would label it as another Yashraj flick with an infamous 'style over substance' tag.Rating :2.5/5" 
" KKKK... KILL dil... Back to the 90s","Dev (ranveer) and Tutu (ali zafar) are professional killers who are raised from the streets by Bhaiyaji (govinda) and trained for that job. They look upon him like their God and at one point Dev ends up saving Disha (parineeti) who was once a criminal. His love for her grows and soon decides to quit his crime life to become a common man despite Tutu's objection. Knowing this, Bhaiyaji decides to reveal about Dev's past to Disha. What happens from there forms the rest. The director has come up with an interesting storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was run of the mill.The dialogues were good some were seeti maar. The script was average and the screenplay could have been better. The background score was melodious and two songs were worth watching. Cinematography was effective. Editing was alright. Costumes were well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was apt. Ranveer Singh was energetic, but we saw a lovable side of him in this film. Ali Zafar has given a talented performance. Parineeti Chopra looks cute and expressive, this film also shows her in her most sexiest avatar. The best among the lot was Govinda who still has not lost that fire and appeal in him.His eight minute monologue alone is reason enough to watch the film, it was fire.Whenever a film is made, it has to be in right proportions in terms of its action, humor, romance. This film succeeds to a point, but its more of a masala entertainer reminiscent of the 90-80s .In this film, the first half goes about with elements of some comedy, some romance and some action. The interval bang was neat and the second half was good but ending was way too abrupt.Overall, Kill Dil is predictable and run of the mill, but its still entertaining and fun at many intervals. The ending to was abrupt but the film had Govinda in fine form.... 3/5* or 6.5/10" 
" GOOD AND ENTERTAINING","I don't understand why there are many average about this movie.
 It has good humour, music and storyline. Govinda And Ali Zafar have done good job." 
" Enjoyed it","This movie was so entertaining but I loved the movie I watched this movie four years ago in 2014 Superb storyline great screenplay good editing good direction Songs are really impressive Ranveer was superb Ali was fine parneeti does well govinda is superb as the villain 7/10 This movie is definitely worth watching for every audience" 
" super Movie","its an excellent movie yes there are things which one would relate to the 90s,but whats the harm in 90s.In 90s we had some of the best movies released. what do you look in a Hindi movie entertainment? songs? story? comedy? actors? this movie has everything its a complete masala movie,the songs are superb,gulzar saab and SEL are superb,the comedy in the movie actually makes u laugh and not like non sense comedy which we see in movies now a days and then they make 200 crores its much better than that 200 crore movies actors are good in the movie and fit their bill. this movie is a must watch movie every1 needs to see this movie,u will rarely see a movie which has combination of super music,amazing lyrics,good story,very good acting,and some sense making comedy. well done YRF and Shaad Ali" 
" Abrupt end mars, but still leaves a mark.","I was very much excited for this movie mainly because of Govinda playing an important role. I found the movie was going well until interval, but in second half the makers seemed to be in a hurry to wrap it up without going in detail. This made viewers unsatisfied where they wanted to see more story and more good ending. It had very good potential to be very good or excellent film, but sudden act of wrapping it up with poor screenplay made it ended up with average fare. They should have worked on screenplay of post interval part and come up with more powerful script. Govinda played well as per the role offered, but still I believe he is not a perfect choice for the role and it would have been offered to some other actor like Jackie Shroff or his role would have been made more stronger giving him more screen presence and better screenplay and definitely movie would have been taken to a new level. Though it could have been much better film, but still I enjoyed watching it and believe it is much better film compared to many 100 Crore films of recent past. Over all it is worth watching and all four lead actors leave their mark with good performance." 
" Please.....Pathetic One!!","Why Govinda? A Performer like you (even in this one also) choose this duffer script for your comeback or just you only see the Yash raj Banner? Why Ranveer? An actor like you, for whom girls will die for, choose this script to show your power packed acting or just you only try to make Aditya Chopra happy? N Parineeti if stereotyped smile n eye rotations are the criteria for your getting movies , please take rest for few days and learn acting first.Old story, poor songs (not a single one you remember before the next one ), failed back ground score and not but least a PATHETIC SCRIPT ."A COMPLETE DISASTER" Shaad Ali you completely killed my Dill. Rest in peace Kill/DillNote: (For which now I may be criticize) : Ali Zafar , your new style make you look like Indian Johnny Depp. Awesomeness Unlimited" 
" First half is surprisingly witty and humorous but second half is shockingly boring","Sometimes, when you feel pressure to do something new and try to make something unusual, there would be chances of wrong landing. It happened here. Somehow, it is overcooked. Story is very simple and routine, so making it new, makers stuffed it with unjustified incidents and old twists and turns. Screenplay does not offer anything new. Like, for showing hero good nature to girl he feeds poor kids in Dhaba, is so many times told. Hats off to dialogues. They are just brilliant and make any normal scene interesting. Chemistry between both male lead is impressive but it lacks in most of the love scenes. I was happy in first half but when it came to interval, I was sensing that second half may have been least interesting and alias it happened. Climax came abruptly and without any justification. There is not a single police investigation of all the murders but suddenly they shown in a single scene!!? Why!? I had already accepted that there is no law and order at all but this small scene broke all my assumptions. Performance wise Ali Zafer is impressive. His looks and expressions match very well. Ranveer Singh is good but not in emotional scenes at all. You will smile while watching him cry. Govinda is balanced. Parineeti Chopda is fine. Music by Shankar-Ehsan-Loy is good. The track " Sajde kiya re" is melodious."
