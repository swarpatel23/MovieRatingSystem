" This movie was a good one and I found it hilarious.","I thought this movie was an okay one because of the storyline. I give the acting a 6 and a half out of ten. I give the storyline a 9/10 and I give the songs a 6/10. Kareena Kapoor pretends that she is in love with Akshaye Khanna but then she really falls in love with him. Circamstances have different plans for them. Akshaye Khanna's dad Amrish Puri and Kareena Kapoor's grandma or mum hate each other but at the end their families get together and Akshaye Khanna and Kareena Kapoor get married. I liked the bit when everyone is running to get the necklace and when Akshay Khanna pretends to be the groom when Kareena Kapoor's grandma/mum finds out." 
" Entertaining...","An adaptation of the 1991 Malayalam film Godfather, Priyadarshan's 'Hulchul' is a thoroughly entertaining film, that also packs in several terrific performances from it's mammoth cast. It's loud, yet a joyride!'Hulchul' Synopsis: A man and woman from feuding families each pretend to fall in love, as part of a revenge plot. Chaos ensues when their fake romance becomes a reality.Neeraj Vora's Screenplay, which focuses on two rival families, is throughly enjoyable, what if it is high pitch. And the dialogue, are superb. The first-hour is absolutely hilarious, while the Second-Hour gets serious & slightly intense. Priyadarshan's Direction is good. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Music by Vidyasagar, is decent.Performance-Wise: Akshaye Khanna is fabulous, as always. Kareena is highly energetic. Paresh Rawal & Arshad Warsi are hilarious! Jackie Shroff is excellent, as ever. Suniel Shetty is extremely likable in a strong supporting role. Arbaaz Khan is adequate. Amrish Puri is great. Laxmi plays the vamp, most convincingly. Manoj Joshi & Shakti Kapoor are terrific. Asrani, Farah Naaz, Akhilendra Mishra & Deep Dhillon lend good support. On the whole, 'Hulchul' is high-voltage entertainment." 
" I had Fun watchin this movie...","A story of 2 estranged families.Hulchul has the premier family of a small town headed by fiery Angarchand, an influential landlord pittet against the family headed by Laksmidevi, a rich landlady of the neighbouring village.Angaarchand and his family of four sons (Jackie shroff Paresh Rawal Akshay Khanna and Arbaaz khan) have taken a vow to stay away from woman owing to a past family tragedy, and there mention of opposite sex is strictly forbidden. At the same time Lakshmidevi is waiting for an opportunity to seek revenge on Angaarchand and his Family. As luck would have it , Angaarchand youngest Son Jay, and Lakshmidevi grand-daughter Anjali fall in love.In the greatest con of romantic Cinema to-date what follows in a comedy error of deceit of rather a naughty kind between the leads with their families in tow trying to be one up on the other.Its really worth spending money on this movie if You like Comedy Family Romance, this is the movie to watch!" 
" A Great Entertainer","Priyadarshan's Hulchul is a great entertainer. Like his earlier film Hungama, this one will also have you in splits. There are a lot of great actors in the film. Starting with Akshay Khanna, Kareena Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Suniel Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Amrish Puri, Arshad Warsi and many more.Arshad Warsi is hilarious, he picks up where he left off in Munna Bhai MBBS. His character is well etched and has you laughing every time he's on the screen. Paresh Rawal is great as usual.Akshaye Kumar and Kareena Kapoor have great on screen chemistry its clearly visible in the song "Rafta Rafta". They fit their roles like a glove. Jackie Shroff and Suniel Shetty are good as usual.Sadly, this is one of Amrish Puri's last performances, but he does a great job. He will be sorely missed and remembered forever!" 
" If you liked Hera Pheri...","Then you would love this movie. Arshad Warshi is so funny, the highlight of the movie.The movie starts off okay, its setting the plot. Here's whats happening, actually the whole plot is very superfluous. But then you would never really care. Wait for Arshad to kick in. The movie sort of slacks off a bit in the end.Acting is good except 'Julie' aunt does not impress. And a series of songs that will bore you. Bad songs and not needed. I wouldn't care about it.Its just a laugh your socks off movie. The dialogs are snappy and very hilarious.You will come out with a good deal of laughs.I rate it 8/10." 
" An above average comedy that can be watched if you have got some spare time","Priyadarshan succeeds when he chooses to portray a meaningless theme on screen. Fights between two families of the boy and girl with all the ridiculous theories is commonplace over trivial issues and in the end their love lords over the enmity. What makes you laugh your heart out is superb acting by Arshad Warsi, Paresh Rawal, and Aksay Khanna who has finally come of age and the complete meaninglessness of the plot that leaves you stunned that whether a more meaningless plot can ever be carved out. Anyway a good light movie that should surely be watched at least once but not more than that.The gahamagahmi scenes which created such a classic out of Hera-Pheri once again makes a comeback towards the end with a foolish marriage ceremony culminating with hero succeeding in putting the Varmala in its proper place." 
" Entertaining","This movie is very entertaining. this film's story about two family. who is enemy. first family head is Angara Chand . he has four sons. second family head name is Lakshmi Devi . Angara Chad's son jay and Lakshmi's grand daughter Anjali (Karina Kapoor) are study together in a college. Anjali doing drama that she loves jay.very funny seen in film. Arsad Warsi comic timing is very good. many character in this film is very funny. Paresh Rawal acting is very good and very funny. Songs of this film is not good but comedy is very good. This Movie is time pass movie. dialog of this movie is very good. Priyadharsan 's movie Hulchul is very good and funny. all Actor 's Acting is very Good. But Paresh Rawal 's Acting is very good. In Short Hulchul movie is very comedy movie." 
" Best family entertainer","This movie was so entertaining and enjoyable I really enjoyed watching the film a lot Akshaye khanna was brilliant kareena kapoor was brilliant arshad warsi is the show stealer paresh is funny Jackie is superb amrish is always remarkable Arbaaz is superb Sunil is superb shakti is superb Nice songs I really enjoyed listening and seeing songs of this movie Good storyline good screenplay good editing good direction Overall 8/10 what a film" 
" Nothing in comparison to Hungama","Hulchul doesn't even stand a chance of being almost as funny as the best comedy I have ever seen, Hungama. Hulchul, once again, reverts to the same old Bollywood formula film with the same plot. Advertised as a comedy, there is so much pointless maar-dhaar and melodrama. Songs aren't that great either. Akshaye and Kareena gave good performances. Priyadarshan is totally unpredictable. Sometimes he'll give a Hera Pheri or Hungama, and sometimes he'll give a Hulchul or a Yeh Tera Ghar Yeh Mera Ghar. Before ending this review, though, there is one scene that is stomach-hurting hilarious in this movie. I'll just say one word--cow. If nothing else, watch that scene. It'll definitely tickle your funny bone." 
" Remade from Malayalam Hit","Hulchul continues Malayalee director Priyadarshan's habit of remaking Malayalam hit movies into Bollywood box office success. Hulchul is a remake of the Siddique-Lal-directed "God Father" (1991), in which two kids from rival families fall in love. Their romance is complicated by the fact that the guy's patriarch and the girl's matriarch bitterly hate each other. The story is somewhat inspired by Romeo and Juliet, except that it's a comedy.("Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega..." (2000), which was not directed by Priyadarshan, was a remake of Priyadarshan's Malayalam superhit "Chandralekha" (1997).)"Hera Pheri" (2000), touted as one of the biggest Bollywood comedies of the past decade, was Priyadarshan's remake of Siddique's first big Malayalam hit, "Ramji Rao Speaking" (1989).It would be nice if Priyadarshan could bring something original to the Bollywood screen, rather than remakes." 
" A terrible plot, terrible dialog's, and a terrible movie","I watched the movie, and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience. The language would put to shame the street loafers.The plot; a father forcing none of his son to marry, seems far-fetched. The idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded's attention....and I was waiting the whole movie for a laugh, and laugh I did on my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look.Hope it saves YOUR time!"
