" Underrated, better than current mishmashes","I got opportunity to watch this movie on Sunday TV, I found it far better than current mishmash of high budget comedy movies we are getting currently. Vijay Raj outshines everybody with his usual antics, We still miss his Kawwa Biryani kind of over confident characters. The whole team of Laughter challenge is in this laugh fest and every body does his bit. Although this movie is shoddily written, loosely based on "Its a mad mad mad world". But the situations created and the situational responses of different characters are hilarious.In the days of cheap sex comedies, I found this movie far more entertaining than other 100 crore earning movies." 
" Interesting funny movie.","I watched this movie today .Its an interesting movie, it contains the best past comedians. A funny story of different characters traveling from Bombay to Goa by bus. The story revolves around many characters who are trying to find a "khazaana". All these characters are funny.Glad there's no songs in this movie, songs could make it boring.Vijay Raaz is at his best as always. You will see all big comedy stars in this movie and some of the villains. Asrani, Shakti Kapoor, Vijay Raaz, Jagdeep,Raju and others.Situations and dialogs are funny. Its a different movie, I wont claim that its the best but its good comedy flick.I would recommend this movie to everyone. You wont regret! AsToK" 
" awful ride!!!","Just when u expect the most from the over-falicitated comedians - Guess what do u have ? Bombay to Goa!!! Althou I didn't expect it to be at par with other running comedy movies but still there was a ray of hope since we already had a taste of these guys in GIL..but guess what ..a sheer disappointment..The film is over-crowded with unwanted actors and scenes,and the worst jokes anyone would ever laugh at!!!..Raju, sunil and ehsaan were wayyy below the expectations.. The only thing that made me smile for 2-3 scenes was Vijay Raaz without which the movie would'nt even get a 4 or 5 rating..Watch it at your own risk and please make sure you have head-ache pills ready by the end.. i bet!!"
