" A Riot!","Ranks, with "Raja Babu," as the best Hindi film of the 1990s. Underscores Govinda's unmatched ability to play camp, over-the-top humour. Jim Carrey has nothing on this guy." 
" Good Govinda, watchable first half but runs out of steam later","'Hero No. 1' has a good first half but is let down by a weak second half. There's lots of typical Govinda comedy. Mind you, Govinda films are generally an acquired taste(!) so keep that in mind. Still, the first half is breezy, albeit brainless fun. The script is complete nonsense but Govinda and Karishma have good chemistry and there are some fun songs. The second half tends to drag. It feels lifted straight from another Hindi film 'Bawarchi' and this can lead to viewer annoyance. The supporting cast are decent although they ALL tend to overact. I found this film watchable but average. It's probably best seen at home with a bunch of friends.Overall 5/10" 
" AWESOME!","My all time favorite movie! It has amazing acting, songs and dancing. Great direction by David Dhawan" 
" Entertainer No. 1","The David Dhawan - Govinda combination has seldom gone wrong. With Hero No. 1, they consolidated their position in the industry.Inspired form the 70's Rajesh Khanna starer Bawarchi, David Dhawan added loads of spicy dialogs, comedy scenes and foot-tapping music to re-create a dish no one could resist. The first half may also remind you of Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge.The story in a nutshell. Boy meets girl in a foreign land. After initial hiccups, the two fall in love. Just when all seems perfect, a misunderstanding between the two families forces them to stay apart. In order to win the girl's family, the boy enters the girl's house as a cook. Slowly but steadily he wins their hearts one by one. But what will happen when they find out the truth?Unlike most David Dhawan films, this one had a more solid plot. You knew that the film was not just a series of jokes playing one after the other. There was a definite storyline. Govinda and Karisma shared a crackling chemistry once again and they sparkled in their performances. Paresh Rawal proved yet again that he is extremely versatile. And this was before Hera Pheri happened. Kader Khan was excellent. Of the supporting cast, Satish Shah added some laughs. In a small role, Shakti Kapoor was quite funny.After a series of hit films with David Dhawan including Cooloe No.1, Anand-Milind maintained their hit streak with yet another super hit musical score. The songs were also filmed extremely well. Sona Kitna Sona Hain is still popular on radio stations even 15 years after the film released.Overall, this is a fun film that you can watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon with your family." 
" Another superhit pair of Govinda and David Dhawan though second half is inspired by Bawarchi","Govinda and DD were a hit team in those days, since Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Coolie No.1, Saajan Chale Sasural In 1997 David and Govinda teamed in Deewana Mastana as well which worked. Hero No.1 starts off showing Kader Khan as a person who swears by time and makes life hell for Govinda who wears specks and all, there are 2 scenes straightly lifted from MR Bean series, One in the car(Govinda getting ready) and another one where he leaves his shoes on a car. There are some funny moments in the first half between Govinda and Karisma, even the encounter between Kader and Paresh is amazing. The second half seems inspired by Bawarchi in fact almost a straight lift from Hrishikesh's classic, DD's films are rarely original and he seems to lift from many 70s and 80s films, mostly MDk films he has confessed to be a fan of MDK. There are some funny moments but not as memorable as Bawarchi, In fact several scenes, dialogues in second half, even characters and twists are similar to the original. David Dhawan does add his own masala in between with action scenes, loud scenes.etcDirection by DD is good Music was a big hit, Sona Kitna is the best song, UP waala also is superb rest are good songsGovinda as always steals the show with a free performance, Karisma Kapoor pairs off well with him but has hardly anything great to do Paresh Rawal is good in his part, Kader Khan too is great Amongst rest Satish Shah, Tiku Talsania and all are good" 
" DD-Govinda hit streak continues","David Dhawan is known as the king of comedy, he is one awesome filmmaker. Barring a few crass films, he has always directed good films. Comedy films are definitely his cup of tea, he sure knows how to make decent Bollywood comedies. Despite being criticized, his silly comedies evoke laughter and that is the major plus point. Dhawan had a streak through the 90s period. He gave back to back hits with actors like Govinda, Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan. His favorite actress has definitely got to be Karishma Kapoor because 90% of his films have Kapoor as the heroine.Hero No.1 is another one of his hit comedies with bits of action. The movie was a big hit of its time. The movie is about Karishma Kapoor who comes from a family where every treats her like a servant except her grandfather. She somehow manages to go for a small tour in Europe. Coincidentially, Govinda who is the son of a businessman Kader Khan also goes to the same tour. The lead pair meet and fall in love after a few misunderstandings. However, they cannot get married because Kader Khan gets into a heavy argument with Karishma's grandfather Paresh Rawal. The rest of the film is how Govinda gets Karishma's grandfather to like Kader Khan and agree with the marriage.Direction by David Dhawan is good. He has handled many scenes well. He really knows how to make you laugh, the comedy is definitely timed well. The hilarious situations like Govinda as the servant appeasing Karishma's sister and brother in laws are awesome. The action despite being forced is good especially for the masses. The tempo of the film is well maintained and despite of a few drags like Karishma's cringe worthy cryings and Paresh overacting, the film is decent.Govinda does a sincere job, his performance is clap worthy. He makes the comedy look natural and his expressions are hilarious. Karishma Kapoor looks good and acts sincerely but her crying is cringe worthy which doesn't make her act perfect. Paresh Rawal is decent but his shouting does get on your nerves. However, he acts properly in most scenes. Kader Khan is hilarious, this guy can do villain and comic roles without any flaws in his acting. He is awesome and he always does good in David Dhawan films. The rest are good.Music is superb, Sona Kitna Sona Hai is catchy with funny lyrics. The rest of the songs are good though there are too many songs. Action is forced yet good like I mentioned. Technically, the film is good as well.On the whole, Hero No. 1 is a decent David Dhawan entertainer. He directs the film well and makes good use of the actors. Everything is timed well and the film is worth watching." 
" A Nice Film!","David Dhawan's 1997 Box-Office Hit 'Hero No. 1' is A Nice Film, that can be viewed with your entire family. Good Writing, Neat Direction & Superb Performances make 'Hero No. 1' worth a watch.'Hero No. 1' Synopsis: Two young Indians, Meena and Rajesh, meet in Europe and fall in love with each other, promising to get married when they return back to India.

Sure, there are some minuses, but they aren't too many to be honest. The film is humorous, progressive & light-hearted. The songs are correctly placed & are very melodious. Rumi Jaffrey's Screenplay is entertaining. David Dhawan's Direction is Neat. Cinematography & Editing, are passable.Performance-Wise: Govinda is absolutely lovable. The Versatile Actor continues his magic! Karisma Kapoor is her usual self, while Kader Khan & Paresh Rawal are terrific. Rakesh Bedi is excellent. Satish Shah, Anil Dhawan & Tiku Talsania are decent. Himani Shivpuri is good. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Hero No. 1' is an entertaining, light-hearted film."
