" Give credit for its "Awesome one liners...."","The storyline is simple  its an ode to Shakespeare's "Comedy of errors". However there are too many sub-plots built into it owing to which there is huge cast, which do not get adequate screen time and works against it. For example, Virendra Harjee was hardly there and where is Neetu Chandra. Anyways, the chemistry and timing was perfect to tickle your funny bone.Performances:: Not going down the route of Oscar award winning speech  let us say all were good. Though bear in mind the following:: Tushhar Kapoor:: Straight out of SOAL sets? Upen Patel & Tanishaa:: Spare the audience  please quit. I nearly included Eesha, but hey  she has done some good work in the past and deserves another chance.Music by Raghav Sachar are hummable.Ashwani Dheer:: Proved track record as a writer in comedy genre. But holding the directorial reins for the first time - not bad at all. Waiting for your second round Sir.In my opinion, the critics were partial to "One Two Three" for not giving its due credit especially the awesome "one-liners". Trust me, even on a second viewing, it will make you laugh." 
" Laughing Riot","One Two Three...Go watch the movie !! Surely watch the watch. A complete illogical comedy movie which I am sure u will enjoy. Try to avoid watching with family, or else will be tough for u guys to control the laughter on ADULT jokes !!Paresh Rawal as usual has been damn good in the movie. Great performance by Neetu Chandra...Looks beautiful in uniform . Improved performance by Tushar.Director deserves a big round of applause even with many flaws in the script.So what are you waiting for, go and watch the movie with your friends." 
" Laughs all the way","Ashwani Dhir (of 'Office Office' television series fame) makes his big screen directorial debut with One Two Three. The film is a low budget fare with a cast that is not from the Bollywood elite. But all of them manage to pull off a good laugh ride.The plot is pretty simple, thankfully. There is no attempt to complicate things and the focus is on getting the funny bone tickle. Sanjay Mishra is the pick of the lot among the cast. His caricature of Jeevan (character actor from the sixties) works. Neeta Chandra's character is a straight lift from Kavita Kaushik's character in the television series 'F.I.R'. Neeta Chandra is good but I would have loved to see Kavita Kaushik herself. That would have added more fun to the proceedings. Sameera Reddy adds to the glamour of the film and Paresh Rawal easily negotiates his role.All in all, a no-brainer fun film." 
" Irrelevant, Irrational, Stupid, Rauncy but very funny....","Lets get a few things clear..Anyone watching this movie (and for that matter almost any comedy in India), should be well prepared for the same slapstick humour that we have been seeing since the days of Johar and Mehmood, IF ANYONE ONE OF You'll GOING TO SEE A COMEDY EXPECT ANYTHING HALF INTELLIGENT IN AN Indian COMEDY THAN You'll ARE FOOLS PLAIN AND SIMPLE.That being said i love such comedies, I'm a simple man with simple tastes who likes to light movies which are away from reality, (I HAVE ENOUGH REALITY IN MY LIFE), and those who like movies like Kya Kool Hain Hum, Masti, will like this movie.ALSO MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS VERY MUCH AN ADULT MOVIE,the jokes are raunchy and since i went with my family i found myself holding back my laughter,on a lot of jokes, and almost squirming in some scenes.That being said lets get to other less relevant things like acting, music, direction etc.The music is ordinary almost bordering on bad, this movie could have done with at least one or two less songs.Acting was good considering the limited premise that was on offer,THE ACTORS WHO ACTUALLY SHONE WERE SUPPORTING ACTORS LIKE dmellos yadav aka papa, and his sidekicks.Paresh Rawal was really good and slightly different after a long time,i love the way they played on the fact that most underwear salesman in India are male.THE ACTRESSES WERE ANOTHER STORY although neetu did a fine job of ripping of the endearing FIR, the other 2 were hideous ONE LOOKED LIKE A MAN AND THE OTHER HAS THE BODY OF A MAN.(one guess as to who was whom).Techinically this movie had nothing to speak about.The movie is filled with lots of good moments especially the double meaning dialogues and the scenes with Papa and his henchmen.What really pulls this movie down are the unnecessary songs, the bad performance by the actresses,the very annoying track with Upen and Tanisha, a few over the top scenes,and the so so climax.IN ALL A TYPICAL Indian COMEDY THATS ALMOST ORIGINAL AND GOOD WAY TO HAVE SOME LIGHT HEARTED FUN IN THE CINEMA...WITH YOUR FRIENDS.-s actresses, some over the top scenes, tanisha/upen,songs,climax.+/-s slapstick, raunchy fun (you like or you hate)???.+s Papa and his henchmen, Paresh Rawal, almost original,good acting.total 7/10 (factoring in the correct expectations that i had and are a must, maybe after a few repeated viewing i may actually like this movie more, but better that good is what i first felt and im sticking to that)." 
" Not a laugh riot but definitely worth a watch","When Priyadarshan makes a movie the expectations are bound to be high. One Two Three may not be upto that mark but still it is a movie worth for the money. The plot is similar to any previous Priyadarshan movie. Suniel Shetty, Paresh Rawal & Tusshar Kapoor play the lead character. All of them bear the same name i.e LAXMINARYAN.Tusshar plays the role of a wannabe Gangster who tries hard to be one. Paresh Rawal plays a Lingerie manufacturer cum seller. Whereas Suniel plays a Workaholic. All of them reach one place where the confusion starts. Suniel Shetty was quite humorous after a long time. Paresh Rawal & Tusshar lived upto the mark. The other Characters playing DON PAPA, ALBERT N PINTO are amazing. The scenes with Suniel n Don Papa are simply hilarious. The Actresses don't have much of a role. Neetu Chandra however is funny even in a small role.The movie may not be as good as Priyan's Hera Pheri however it is a good movie. If you watch this movie with high expectation you are going to be let down. But if you need to have a decent laugh, then this light hearted movie is definitely worth a watch" 
" A Good Comedy","It has made a good change to watch some good comedy and its even better to know that, with a few exceptions, the cast does not include much of the Bollywood elite.Laxmi Narayan's mother begs the Don to allow her son to commit one murder so that he is able to join and after endless begging, one chance is given. In the meantime, in another part of the city, another man, an employee, who is confused on entering his boss's office and instructed to sit, whether he should sit on the left chair or the sofa or on the right, annoys his boss, who then instructs him that he wants him to go and buy a car and that he has already e - mailed the information. Finally, in Delhi, another man is selling lingerie from a vehicle, when his son calls him and instructs him about going to visit their supplier. But then an underworld man is killed, while he tries to save a diamond that has been smuggled and hid in an antique car. Oddly all three men are named Laxmi Narayan.The movie stars Neetu Chandra, Sunil Shetty, Esha Deol, Tusshar Kapoor, Ashwin Mushran, Sameera Reddy, Vrijesh Hirjee, Paresh Rawal, Manoj Pahwa and Mukesh Tiwari.While Esha Deol, has to some extent, improved and Sameera Reddy has gone on to add some glamour to this movie. Naturally Paresh Rawal is at his best as usual and Tusshar Kapoor is also good as are all the others and more so with Vrijesh Hirjee and Manoj Pahwa.One Two Three, directed by Ashwani Dhir of "Office Office" fame, is a good comedy to watch and so far this year it has been the best out of the genre that has been released." 
" Blame it on the Bellboy","Ashwini Dheer who got famous on the idiot box with Office Office turned towards films with One Two Three based on Blame it on the Bellboy The film has a hugecast of Sunil Shetty, Tusshar, Paresh to regulars like Mukesh Tiwari,Sanjay Mishra, Neetu Chandra to non actors Upen Patel, Esha Deol, Sameera Reddy And Tanisha. The film rests on a thin plot but it's the complications regarding the name that make you laugh, some scenes are too stupid too but yet in overall there are plenty of laughs guaranteed.Direction by Ashwini Dheer is good Music is ordinaryAmongst actors Suneil Shetty is very funny this time, the actor has grown in comedy which was his weak point earlier, He is funny Tusshar is okay, Paresh Rawal is not that great Amongst rest Neetu Chandra reprises Kavita Kaushik's role from the soap FIR but is not as funny, Esha Deol is terrible like always, Tanisha gets no scope thankfully, Sameera Reddy is horrible Upen Patel is as usual horrible, Sanjay Mishra is the best impersonating Jeevan, Mukesh Tiwari and Vrajesh Hirjee are good, rest are okay" 
" yet another typical laugh riot from Ashwini Dheer!","So Dheer uses the exact same formula for his film, a comedy of  errors in which a bunch of zany characters after money--after several  comic misunderstandings--come together in an even more zany climax. Who  can blame him though? His formula always produces a hit, and I'm not  complaining as long as it makes me laugh! Make sure you leave your  brain at home when watching this. A few jokes in this film are a bit  more vulgar than his usual, which actually makes it even more  hilarious. Suniel Shetty, Tusshar, Tusshar's mom, Neetu, Paresh Rawal,  and Sameera Reddy were awesome! Upen Patel, Tanisha, and surprisingly  Esha Deol were quite pathetic. Songs are good. One of Dheer's  better films in recent times." 
" Surprisingly good comedy!!","One Two Three is a comedy movie and an unofficial remake of 'Blame it on the bellboy'.The star cast are Sunil Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Tusshar Kapoor, Esha Deol, Sameera Reddy, Neetu Chandra, Upen Patel and Tanisha Mukherjee with supporting cast of Mukesh Tiwari, Sanjay Mishra, Vrajesh Hirjee , Manoj Pahwa and Murli Sharma.This movie could be termed as one of the underrated comedy movie due to various reasons. It has some good funny one liners and some of the best bone tickling comedy.The acting by Sunil Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Mukesh Tiwari and Sanjay Mishra is fantastic and they have major contribution in the laugh riot. Tusshar Kapoor and Esha Deol is getting movies on the name of their super successful parents. Manoj Pahwa, Vrajesh Hirji and Murli Sharma are sea of talent and could've been utilised more.Upen Patel is a model turned hero and not actor and he has to understand that acting is not his cup of tea. Neetu Chandra had done some good work but in this movie she irritates with her forced Haryanvi accent. Surprisingly Tanisha Mukherjee is daughter of legendary actress Tanuja and sister of another super successful actress Kajol but she doesn't have even 1% talent in comparison of her family members.The movie is a good and entertaining comedy movie and should be watched for the impeccable comic timing by Sanjay Mishra, Mukesh Tiwari and Vrajesh Hirji. Overall a decent comedy movie" 
" One Two Three is the kind of film that will make you want your money back.","Let's assume you had the worst week of your life — you lost your job, you were mugged at gunpoint, and your wife ran off with your best friend. Understandably, you're looking for something to cheer you up, and considering the week you've just had, even an average comedy would make you smile. One Two Three, this week's new Bollywood release from director Ashwani Dhir is not that film. It's not likely to uplift your spirits; in fact, I won't be surprised if it depresses you some more. In the tradition of many recent brain-dead comedies, One Two Three is another one of those stupid films that has neither script nor plot to speak of, yet hopes you will ignore all of that and succumb to its juvenile attempts at making you laugh. The film's about three guys with the same name who land up at the same place and get mistaken for one another, all of it ending up in much chaos. Laxmi Narayan No 1 is Tusshar Kapoor a wannabe gangster, Laxmi Narayan No 2 is Sunil Shetty a dim-witted office employee, and Laxmi Narayan No 3 is Paresh Rawal a bra-and-panties retailer. All three show up in Pondicherry — or Pondy as they keep referring to it in the film — on different missions, but all hell breaks loose when one gets mixed up for the other. Sameera Reddy, Esha Deol and Neetu Chandra play the ladies who find themselves inadvertently involved with the three Laxmi Narayans. Wait, there's more — Upen Patel and Tanisha Mukherjee are a young couple who chance upon a precious diamond that one of our Laxmi Narayans is here to seize. And if that wasn't enough already, there's also an assortment of underworld dons and henchmen who jump into the fray. Borrowing gags from a wide range of sources — the Mr Bean series, to a bunch of similarly tacky B-grade comedies — One Two Three delivers pedestrian humour including cheap sex jokes, and silly one-liners every other minute. There is so much talk of bra-sizes and ill-fitting underwear that it makes you want to gag the writer with his own pair. Apart from maybe three moments that genuinely make you giggle, the rest of this film is one bitter pill to swallow. It doesn't help that the film's endlessly long and the actors frustratingly foolish. Surprisingly, it's the wooden-as-a-block Sunil Shetty who lucks out with the wittiest role in this film. The rest, including Paresh Rawal, are an absolute embarrassment.It's the kind of film that'll make you want your ticket money back!" 
" Pointless","It is meant to be funny but it actually was very vain and just a plain waste of time. I simply refuse to believe that pointless films like this still get made. The jokes were so lame, the only good thing about the film was a song or two.The main plot revolves around 3 guys with the same name (Played by Suneil Shetty, Paresh Rawal & Tushar Kapoor). One is a hired assassin, one is an underwear merchant and one is a car salesman. Somehow, their identities get switched when they all lodge in the same hotel and chaos is what ensues.The sorry excuse for a story could have been told in 90 minutes or less but instead they put us through nearly 3 hours of hell. You've been warned.D-"
