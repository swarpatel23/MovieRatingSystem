" A shame for the Bollywood movies","I will really amazed by the people who had went to theaters to watch this movie and has watched till end. These people are either blind and deaf or this is the first movie they are watching in their life. It is not that this is the worst movie made ever, but such thrash coming from the people who has given movie like "Gupt" is really saddening. The base of the movie is adult comedy, stupid sense of humor, and making fun of a dead body. A rich businessman dies, but because his family needs his wealth they are showing the world outside that he is still alive, by moving his dead body around. Meanwhile, for some or the other reason they are also cutting different parts from the dead body. Also at each day one of the other family friend is getting killed by this family, and again they have to move the dead body as it is alive and show it to the world. Also, while achieving this horrendous task, the family also finds out the shady truths about their family members. These truths vary from woman having affair with another man, man having affair with man, and also the children finding out that their real father is different, and for that they are being proud to moms. The bad thing about the movie is the movie has some great actors of current era like Paresh Rawal, and Om Puri. Having such great actors in such kind of movies is very saddening, as it makes to think us what is that which makes actors signing movie. I have rated this movie 1/10 as this is the least vote I can give. Unfortunately IMDb does not support negative ranking. This movie is the greatest insult to the Indian culture and family values. Its not that the movie with such subjects should always be bad, but then the dialogs, the scenes, the characters, and overall presentation is very very bad. They say that you will die laughing, but at the end you may want to suicide with shame." 
" Pretty Funny!!!! Brainless!! Adult Comedy","Its a Nice Movie but Be Careful THE JOLTS of Laughter can give a Heart AttackThe Acting is great by everyone!!!! 8/10 The Direction is Also Fine, but it has bad cinematography The Actors are amazing, Rakhi Sawant Character is Way too pushed in the Movie, you will see a A Lot of Rakhi in the film, She looks Amazingly Hot, and Brutally Funny.Paresh Rawal is acceptable as he always plays like himself!!!! there is no Sense of Story Except the Man Dead is big Business Man and they are trying to hide him for Money THATS IT!!! End of Story!!!The Movie Scores Nothing in Big Cinema, It's just a movie to be watched at Home!!! ALONE !!!(Read the Title of my Comment), It's just a Movie for Timepass, you will have fun watching it.Good Jokes are Executed nicely but it will not stay for Longer, The movie will be hit with in homes and friends...I will Rate this Movie 8 on 10" 
" The worst movie I have ever seen","I have an eclectic taste in movies. I like all different genres and even when I don't particularly enjoy a movie, I can usually (if grudgingly) accept that it wasn't a bad one. But Budha Mar Gaya has nothing to say in its defence. I have watched my share of bad movies but this one takes the cake by far.There is now a trend in bollywood for making weird type of comedys. It can be best described as a combination of in-your-face, intentionally- stupid, and ridiculous exaggeration making a very, very unfunny concoction. And the sad part is that these films are doing well, which unfortunately shows the intelligence of the average Indian. Buddha Mar gaya is the epitome of the comedy described above. There is no storyline and the movie is expected to float on its on using the comedy as a life jacket. The performances are terrible, including the (in)famous Rakhi Sawant. However, to be fair, one can't really blame them as it is probably the way the scrip forced them to act. It's a wonder why fine actors of Bollywood like Anupam Kher accept such scripts in the first place. A malaise has struck bollywood, and the result is that trashy movies are being made, best characterized by Buddhu Mar Gaya.Must not watch. 0/10" 
" Truly a black comedy","this movie is basically what the title means, an old man dies, and how the family deals with it thereafter.It mainly revolves around the firm the dead old man owned, and how the family tries to keep him alive to ensure they gain the most out of the IPO for the firm's shares.Rather amusing as it explores a lot of themes, gay relationships, the trade of bodies, pretentious politicians, you get the idea.Sadly, not many viewers have been able to appreciate this comedy, for taking insult at the storyline, hence the low rating on IMDb.You have been warned that it is a black comedy.Watch the whole movie, and watch it with an open mind, and think about the themes.Should be rated 8/10 by everyone."
