" Nice one ....","It is a nice one....but you need to have patience and be in a calm mood to enjoy. The story will unravel itself one by one like jigsaw puzzle. Dia Mirza rocks in a dramatic role....I would recommend this film to be watched anytime you are looking for modern clinical storyline where every dialogue is studied and referenced and then put in the story.The end is the only thing which does not match the tempo of the film. I was surprised that it took me one full year to watch this film...it might be because there was little star cast, in fact the whole film was made with less than 10 people....which you will realise at the end of the film."
