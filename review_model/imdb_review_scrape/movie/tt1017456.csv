" Remarkably unpredictable","I wouldn't say that race is a great movie. It is good and different. It is not the usual triangle love story and betrayal and it is unpredictable. The plot should not be known completely before as it has many twists and turns. Knowing the plot reduces the effect of watching like many other thrillers The twists are the main attraction of this film. Coming to the plot Ranvir(Saif Ali Khan) and Rajiv(Akshay Khanna) are brothers who has so many different likes and dislikes. Ranvir is very mature and serious while Rajiv is semi alcoholic. Both of them share a common interest one is racing and the other is supermodel Sonia (Bipasha Basu). Ranvir's secretary Sophia(Katrina Kaif) has a crush on him. She remembers his birthday and presents him with a birthday greeting card.Songs composed by Pritam are great. Songs like pehli nazar mein and allah duhai are wonderful to listen.Acting is good. My opinion about Saif Ali Khan in a serious role has changed after seeing this. Akshay Khanna has done his best performance so far. Bipasha was good in her respective role. Even though Katrina Kaif is not considered a great actress, she was above average in this movie. It is worth a look if you admire bollywood film. And this film is worth watching if you are a fan of either Saif or Bipasha.8/10" 
" Entertaining","This movie was entertaining and all the twists were good however i must ask why a director must spoil a perfectly good thriller/action film with MINDLESS STUPID AND UNREALISTIC ACTION SCENES! YOU CANNOT DRIVE A CAR ON ITS SIDE, YOU CANNOT JUMP BUILDINGS THE WAY THEY DID AND YOU CANNOT WALK OUT OF A HORRIFIC CAR CRASH WITHOUT A SINGLE BROKEN BONE!Indian movies were doing so good and then some guy decides to put in stupid scenes in a good movie to leave a bad tasteBut still, good film to watch, just ignore the unrealistic scenes. Acting was good all around except for Katerina..she was terrible. Also, them trying to make her look sexy to compete with Bipasha just failed miserably. One song was good, the rest were not something I listen to. Overall, 9 out 10 for story" 
" This movie has twists that may/may not surprise you","This movie has twists that may/may not surprise you. But it is an Excellent Movie. It's got Excellent Production Value. Overall, a must see Bollywood flick. Won't reveal the story but it's worth watching at least once!!!What works for Race is that you can never predict exactly whats gonna happen next. Just when you think, this could be the last twist in the tale, it surprises you with another twist. There is almost a twist in every reel!Directors Abbas â€“ Mastan deserve credit for their execution, they succeed in holding your attention throughout the movie. The direction is complimented by the screenplay although the impact would have been much better had the story been more convincing. With so many twists and turns, the viewer after a certain point could get confused as to whose with who. Also it gets a little tedious to sit through.As far as the editing is concerned two songs can be easily chopped off for better impact. The music is brilliant, Pehli Nazar Mein stands out. Dialogues are superb. Cinematography brilliant!" 
" Revival of Saif","Firstly take note that - Race is not a movie made for them those who power on the DVD player then insert the disc in it, and watch it till they feel asleep. This is made for them those who want to use their inner intelligence and sharp-brain to understand actually what is going on in between every roles. Don't rate this comment those who don't like Hindi thrillers.I find it hard to believe even after fourth time watching Race that how Saif performed a deadly serious role as Ranvir Singh. In his first offer with director duo Abbas-Mustan he proved it great. So far his roles were mostly prepared for comedian purposes like in Hum Tum, Dil Chahta Hai or Salaam Namaste, but here he really proved that now he is matured as an actor by performing a serious, no nonsense and one-word guy's role.Personally I like to watch movies made by Abbas-Mustan for their sense of making thrillers in Bollywood, and I cannot throw away Race apart from my mind. The story has some worth seeing twists which are surprisingly enjoyable. In funny and hilarious sections Akshaya and Anil own their credits. Although this is Akshaya's second negative character under the project of Abbas-Mustan after Humraaz, his role has enough importance in moving forward of the movie. Anil's role as a fruit-eater inspector Robert D' Costa (RD) makes a good sense of humour with his riddling but indicative words. For sometimes it is confusing whether RD is a negative or positive character, but it becomes clear only at the final ending part.For the three glamor queens Sonia, Sophia and Mini (Bipasha, Katrina and Sameera), they have no much ability to handle the story since it is mainly controlled by the male leads, and focus goes on and on waiting to reveal the hidden truths. Ooops!!! after a long break from director duo, Johny Lever again appears in front of the camera for five minute, but with nothing special. Same is to Dilip Tahil who is the closest rival of Ranvir in horse racing business.If we judge Race with proper sense there are bound to arise numerous goofs and faults in the whole set of the movie, anyway it's just made for entertainment. One most important goof I noticed is when Ranvir and Sophia goes to Capetown for some official purposes, but Rajiv also moves there and secretly attends an appointment in the marriage bureau along with Sophia (Katrina). But question is - does not Sonia (Bipasha) notice when Rajiv is not around her?For Akshaya and Katrina's fans Race might be flop, while for Saif and Bipasha's fans it might be a super-hit. This is generally how a movie is rated by audiences. They don't like their favourite actors/actresses to get defeated in the climax, but if it happens so they will consider it worthless or super-flop. In truth a movie is considered successful mostly through the process of business profit --> large audiences = large earning. If you check weekly in the websites on the movie which is doing good businesses, it will be finally declared as hit, sometimes super-hit (or blockbuster) if the businesses run better than expected.Finally, I like the movie only just due to Saif's new revival role of serious Ranvir Singh, and Akshaya Khanna's negative but interesting role as step brother Rajiv Singh." 
" Twists Twists Twists.............but finally brilliant ending","this film is good for entertainment.......twists are overloaded but it gains up in the climax...........starting is a mix up of '36 china town' and 'humraaz' (what i felt) but is acceptable. You'll see many stunts and direction is done pretty well .......however the story is full of suspense (thats what abbas mustan is known for).........the dialogs are little bit like one liners and most of them are not much impressive..........there are some confusing and forceful twists too ................ The film has good songs which wont let you get bored .........here saif ali khan and bipasha basu played an important role .....i tell you the ending is very good and i appreciate them (if not copied from Hollywood film)..........overall, its a must watch film .........u cant complain in the end." 
" Good fun","I am going to start by saying that a movie should be judged on a) its own merits and b) on the genre to which it belongs. To be overly cynical and to trash a movie by comparing it with some unrealistic ideal is silly because there is nothing like a perfect movie, least of all in Bollywood. I give the movie a high five because of the elan with which it's done. It's slick, fast paced and uncluttered. If it uses "hot babes" and fast cars it is only to further the story. The movie is about two brothers and their conflict with women being mere pawns in the whole game of lucre and one upmanship. The actors are comfortable in their roles so hats off to the casting team. Here, I would only question the casting of Katrina Kaif who has been a disappointment in countless films and was eminently unsuitable for the role of the hot, scheming secretary that she portrays. She is nothing but a clothes horse and ruined the "Kiss me Kiss me" number. On the other hand, Bipasha can act, looks great and holds her own. Saif can give SKR a run for his money any day. His stunning good looks are unsurpassed in Bollywood except perhaps by Hrithik. He has come into his own in the last few years and we see evidence of it in RACE. He is cool and macho but can be tender and caring when needed. Akshaye Khanna is good at the portrayal of the malcontent, the aggrieved younger brother holding cancerous grudges. He does it well without any of the villainous stereotyping that Hindi movies revel in. Cinematography is fabulous. I loved the locations, the evening scenes that have been shot in that beautiful south African light. The farms scenes are idyllic in sharp deliberate contrast to the fast paced suspense and action of the movie. The music is great too. Upbeat, fast paced to match the mood of the film and full of gorgeous colour and pageant that typify Hindi movies. I say, watch the movie! It is good fun and doesn't pretend to be anything else." 
" A lot of unexpected twists","By the title, I expected the movie to be some racing movie type having fast cars or the plot related to the horse racing but it's different. It's about the life Race. You never know what just happened and what's coming. It would seem too foolish if one started predicting the end. It's too exciting. I never thought this movie would have so much twists and turns. The direction is just fine, not perfect but the plot is brilliant. Katrina and Bipasha acted well while Saif Ali Khan, Akshaya Khanna and Anil Kapoor make the movie fantastic. Several flaws can be easily detected but still, the movie runs too good that those flaws would be negligible. Background music and the songs are okay.One need not use his head much because everything has been explained. The movie is much for watch and enjoy. It's a full entertainment package." 
" The Best Action-Thriller of 2008 For Bollywood","My rating 8 out of 10...Right from the start, this movie will hold you down. Frankly speaking, this movie's story is not that great, and you might have seen it earlier, with two brother fighting over money. But what is different is the way and manner of presentation. We have so many love stories, but every time it's the manner of presentation that makes movies great! Same is true for Race. Arguably the best movie of 2008. So many twists and turns, this makes for the best popcorn flick of 2008! I suggest you to watch it before the end of the year and make is count in the top movies! Katrina Kaif's acting skills have definitely improved, Bipasha is fine, Akshay Khanna is good but Saif's acting is the top notch point of this movie. He should go for more action movies...A Must Watch! Go for it!" 
" Too twisty and tries to pack it all! Saif has done a great job though!","When youâ€™re talking of an Abbas-Mastan movie, you know what to expect. Big money, big game, plots, deceits, back-stabs twists and turns. Itâ€™s just that, this time, it gets so much more complicated and twisty that the duoâ€™s previous hits like Baazigar, Khiladi will seem like a kid game. The saving grace however is Saif who has lately come of age after delivering great performances in Parineeta, Omkara, Hum Tum, etc.Ranvir (Saif Ali Khan) and Rajiv Singh (Akshaye Khanna) are step brothers owning a lavish stud farm â€˜Stallionsâ€™ local biggies at the turf club in Durban. The older Ranvir loves horses more than anything else while younger Rajiv is a drunk who is least bothered about the family business which is now totally under mortgage. Racing, money, fending off enemies and partying are a way of life for both, till an accident triggers change.The older brother sacrifices his love (Bipasha) when the Rajiv one promises that he would give up drinking addiction if he married Sonia. But, Rajiv doesnâ€™t change after marriage and things end up getting steamy between Sonia and Ranvir. While things look nice between brothers, one of them is busy plotting for the otherâ€™s death to pack off 100 million bucks from his insurance. Then, there is a murder and things get murky.The rest of the movie merely survives on the director duoâ€™s ability to set up things in one direction, then, twist it at the very next moment. Till the last few minutes, one is not too sure as to who the conspirator was and which actress is whose love interest. Adding to the mÃªlÃ©e is a fruit munching cop RD (Anil Kapoor) and his inept assistant (Sameera Reddy), both competing with each other in being as silly as things ever can be.Of the performances, Saif is awesome and Akshay Khanna has done a neat job too. All three glamor dolls had no more to do in the movie except to look good. Another funny thing was that every other character there was mostly an Indian, the doctor, the registrar, the cops, their assistants, Saifâ€™s competitor, whew; I never knew Indians were so omnipresent! The music is decent and Atif Aslamâ€™s song is already a hit.Race has many points when twists get too much, and you would it end soon and when things start seeming comical. But, nevertheless to their credit, the directors have delivered a stylish flick set in South Africa and Dubai with some good stunts. Alas, they donâ€™t do much to save the movie. Still, if you are one of those who like movies sans logic and merely sit through and pass time, Race is not a bad idea if you get tickets cheap." 
" must watch movie","The latest thriller made by Bollywood thriller masters Abbas-Mustan's is an A-class entertainer and a must watch movie. Sexy women in short clothes, handsome hunks, beautiful locations, good stunts, lots of songs with catchy rhythm and loud music is a good definition of a masala flick.Excellent movie with so much twists. It will keep u guessing and u will be shocked to see how many twist in a movie. It will keep u on edge till the end. I recommend this movie for thrill lovers. I personally enjoyed this movie. Great acting by all, i personally liked Akshay Khanna's acting and style of Saif and Comedy of Johnny Lever who was a Special Appearance in a movie. It has comedy,fun,thrill,action. This movie has good songs as well and one of Atif Aslam." 
" Won 1st prize","Whether you are into thriller, action or comedy, Race has a good blend of all three genre. It started off like a bomb and then tells its story and is very entertaining from beginning to end also it had a great setting in Dubai & South Africa. The best thing about the movie is that has a very interesting beginning & ending and they are are the most important scenes because of the the first & and last impression.The comedy is humorous with excellent dialogues and Johnny Lever's special appearance was so funny that I had a sore stomach and tearful eyes. The thriller had plenty of suspense and you just don't know who is bad, who is good? and who is framing who?. The twists & turns were unpredictable and turned out to be very different from what I was expecting.Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Bipasha Basu & Anil Kapoor were the best and the all acted really well. Music is rocking and the best songs are Race Saanson Ki (which stands out with its memorable electric guitar intro), Zara Zara and Pehli Nazar Mein. The songs gets better the more times you listen to them and when they are viewed on the big screen.Abbas-Mustan are known for creating good music in all of their films. They are one of my favourite directors; I loved their films ever since I seen Baazigar because no other director in Bollywood makes thrillers like them. Although they are inspired from Hollywood movies but their films are better than the original which are:Race- Goodbye Lover (1998)Naqaab- Dot the I (2003)36 China Town- Chinatown (1974) Aitraaz- Disclosure (1994) Humraaz- A Perfect Murder (1998) Ajnabee- Consenting Adults (1992) Daraar- Sleeping with the Enemy(1991) Baazigar- A Kiss Before Dying (1991)Overall I really liked the film. It was stylish with a great atmosphere, & background score and keeps you entertained in every possible way. Race stands for (Riveting, Awesome, Cool, Excellent)." 
" Worth a watch","Race was a mixed bag of surprises. Primararily I went to watch the  movie because I really liked their promos. Race Saanson ki (the title  track) also happened to be my current favorite.  What is best about this movie is that the director ensures that you are  glued to your seat from start to finish. There are enough twists and  turns to keep you guessing for more.  Of course the credit for keeping the audience engaged also goes to Saif  who is fantastic as the ambitious go getter brother. Akshaye Khanna also  deserves a special mention for being on par with Saif in the acting  department! His comic timing is really good. The ladies Katrina and  Bipasha have been given a beautiful wardrobe and carry it off extremely  well. They do add value to the star cast.  The only dampener that I felt was the comedy department could have been  better.The dialogues between Anil Kapoor and Sameera were way too  silly! Like trying really hard to make you laugh but absolutely run of  the mill jokes..Sameera was looking silly trying to act like a dumb  blonde..!   The ACTION sequences deserve a special mention (clap clap)..as they are  very stylized. The director seems to have really invested some time and  money in this department.  All in all a movie worth a watch as it is especially heart warming to  see old time directors like Abbas Mustan try to keep up with the  current times when it comes to packaging a movie in a stylized way." 
" One of the 10 Best Thrillers from Bollywood in the recent years.","After seeing "Race", I could say that keeping the inspiration fact aside from their track record, Abbas Mastan are no doubt one of the top 3 directors of thrillers movies in Indian Cinema. And "Race" proves that again and the movie can be stated as the most impressive work from the director duo after their last few pale attempts. "Race" is a high paced and slickly edited thriller with shocks & more shocks for the viewers at regular intervals. And with each new turn you come forward on the edge of your seat. As I don't prefer wasting words on giving out the story of the movie in my reviews, I would just like to add that its one of the most tightly written script and you dare don't go for a popcorn in between the movie or else you will miss a new twist in the story.All the characters have a well defined role and the casting is just near to perfect too (with only Sameera Reddy as a miscast). Each person in the script has a plan against the other and after the light 20 minutes in the opening, the movie just picks up the speed with a kick start. At times you feel that its going too pacy and there are too much twists and turns in the plot, but still its all enjoyable to a great extent.The first half has Saif Ali Khan, Akshay Khanna, Bipasha & Katrina as the lead. Saif clearly gives another powerful performance after "Omkara". Akshay Khanna too performs a tough role in an impressive manner. He can easily add this movie in his career's Top 3. Bipasha looks more ravishing than Katrina, but they both surely give the required "Oomph Impact" to the racy thriller.At the end of the first half enters Anil Kapoor as the detective. And from here onwards you start enjoying the movie more with his one liners and comic timings. But Sameera seems to be unfit in her "Kitty-Karmachand" role as an assistant to Anil. Anil is very entertaining eating all kinds of fruits while he is investigating. Johny Lever is wasted as he is there only for one scene, but he had to be there since he is the lucky mascot of the director duo from "Khiladi" days. While watching "RACE", each time you think that now the whole plan is told, there comes another twist and this continues till the last scene of the movie.The one thing which can be said as the weakness in the script is that there is no Police involvement shown in the crime. Anil Kapoor is supposed to be the only official detective looking into the case and he is too involved in the plot. The second half belongs to Anil and Saif equally and they both simply excel. The Climax is one of best in the recent times as it is not concerned in showing the victory of truth, but shows how the conmen win and respect the intelligence of the other. The songs are quite enjoyable but there is already plagiarism factor involved with "Pritam" lifting more than one tunes. The background score also seems to be inspired from "Mission Impossible" and "James Bond" Themes. I think the fast paced instrumental version of "Allah Duhai Hai" should have been used repeatedly in the background rather than the slow theme music. It would have given more pace to the scenes.Summing up, this is one of the best works of Abbas Mastan, and one of the best Thrillers coming out of the Indian Film Industry. The only fear I have is that I should not receive any mails in the coming days that the movie is an inspired one. I pray that it should be an original work from the makers as this is indeed a commendable one.Go for it, the movie can turn you into a fan of thrillers." 
" What was everyone thinking?","I have been watching Abbas-Mustan movies ever since their first, Khiladi. While I have never claimed to be a fan of their work, During that period of Indian films, they were probably the only people who made their movies 'different' to what else was being made on that budget and scale, so I watched and got entertained to a certain degree.The brothers follow a tried and tested plan - 1) Take a Hollywood mystery/thriller, preferably B-Grade Hollywood, movies that have not got theatrical releases in India.2) Add 6-7 foot-tapping songs, inserted at regular intervals.3) Give the main lead (who is always a character with 'shades of grey') a strong motive for doing the dastardly deeds that he does.4) Follow up with a fantastic climax.So that was what I was expecting when I went to see 'RACE' in the cinema, and I couldn't help but leave the cinema thinking - "Well, that was money ill-spent." Race starts with a car-stunt and a voice-over delivered by Anil Kapoor, that is meant to be an introduction to our four main lead characters (Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Katrina Kaif and Bipasha Basu), but land up as being nothing more than an advertisement to the viewing public for how good designers can make our film stars look. And even though the picture tries to take a path down the 'Clever Thriller' mode, all it displays is 'Clever Dress Design'.Granted, the story had the potential to be interesting, It was just presented in a really jaded, 90's kind of way where there are songs that interrupt the flow of the story regular as clockwork.I mean - of course I like nothing more than Bipasha or Katrina Dancing the night away in skimpy outfits, but in a story like this, they achieve nothing but hamper the narrative. In fact so much so, that by the time the climax came around, the whole cinema was itching for it to get over! That can never be a good sign. So, a movie, that could have been a taut thriller becomes nothing but a parody of what its trying to achieve, and a too long one at that.In short, its a picture too long by about an hour. With a little bit of editing, and not as many songs, It could have been a good thriller.Of the performances, it doesn't even need to be said, that Anil Kapoor has found a way of breathing life into the most mundane movies, just by being in them, and even here, he gives a masterclass on how to carry off an over-the-top performance without coming across as a ham actor. Sameera Reddy, as Anil Kapoor's thick-headed secretary is also fun to watch, not to mention, hot in her own, dusky, South-Indian way. Akshaye Khanna is always good to watch, clearly more than competent to carry of the role he's given, He is absolutely devious. Saif Ali Khan is going through the motions here, all he needs to do in the movie is look good, ride lots of horses and look good... Katrina Kaif and Bipasha Basu, besides being the prettiest and fittest women respectively in the Indian Film Industry today (IMO) are clearly capable of what's required of them, and they do it well.After an interesting first 45 minutes, the film gets too slow and boring to enjoy, and towards the last half hour, there is one scene of special mention, that brings some sort of fun back into it, and that is Johnny Lever's solitary scene. He's done an intelligently funny scene after a LONG time and special mention goes out to him.All in all, I gave it 5 points out of 10, simply because Johnny Lever's single appearance is worth 2 points, the other three are for the attempt." 
" A Perfect Piece Of Junk!!!","It was a rubbish since the first scene of the movie, actor like ANIL KAPOOR was wasted in the movie, only fools could call it a suspense, because i think every suspense of the movie could be expected. ABBAS MUSTAN should stop making movies if they just want to make it for irritation. Their movies are a piece of junk as they don't have any story and it still keeps flowing in any direction. Their movies are a rip off of Hitchcock's old movies.After 36 China Town the standard of their movies have come down, It was nothing compared to how they did the publicity. ANIL KAPOOR had the best role which was also not necessary for him to do as it was a funny role any junior artist could do, AKSHAY KHANNA sucked like always, SAIF ALI KHAN looked like a prisoner from jail, the actresses had just came in every scene and stood their like a statue while the actors said the dialogs. I HATED THE MOVIE AND DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!" 
" Wonderful movie!Worth watching!","RACE released early here in Bahrain(before it released in India) & I got an opportunity to watch the movie yesterday! The movie starts off well telling the audience a lot about the characters and leaving some unsolved facts which you will find out later in the movie.The movie is around 2 hours 45 minutes(not sure) and the first half of the movie is REALLY SERIOUS compared to the next half when Anil Kapoor comes in.I think Anil Kapoor really saved the movie with his humour otherwise it would end up being one of those really serious movies!Because when he comes in,you'll be laughing every 5 minutes! Storyline is just about perfect,although I think the first half should have been a little less serious.Has a lot of action and surprises throughout the movie.It even makes the audience think a lot and try to solve some of the mysteries themselves.I'm only giving it an 8/10 because I think it reminds me of a lot of Hollywood movie story lines put together.But this movie can still leave you entertained and satisfied as you leave the cinema!"
