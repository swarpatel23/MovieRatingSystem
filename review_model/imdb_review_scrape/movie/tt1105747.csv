" All style but not much substance","Veteran director Subhash Ghai is hoping to resurrect some of the credibility he lost with his previous flops Yaadein & Kisna with this glossy drama. I never really intended to see it when I heard about it because Katrina Kaif is in it and all of her films suck (except Race). But the promos was so good and I loved the music especially the Dost song composed by the best music composer & lyrics writer combo A R Rehman and Gulzar. So I seen it anyway and its about Yuvvraaj (Prince) who gets thrown out of his family. He wants to get married to this really rich girl but her father wants her to marry someone else. So he signs a contract with him that in 40 days, he will become twice as rich as him. He eventually gets closer to one of his brothers and realises that he is happy to help him without wanting anything.The story & screenplay is o.k. but it's quite long for a 2.5 hour movie because their wasn't enough to make it that long. None of the actors acted well except Anil Kapoor and Katrina Kaif was simply the worst, she is completely crap. Neither she knows acting, language (her voice is always dubbed for her), dance and always fails to impress. I do not like her one bit and if she was replaced by someone else then that would've helped a lot. The film had big sets that were so good and visually impressive that they keep you in your seat throughout. Overall if you have nothing to do on a rainy day or something then watch it but Yuvvraaj is nothing to look forward to." 
" Ludicrous dialog, incoherent plot line and horrible acting!","This was an absolute disaster, and almost painful to sit through. The only thing the film has going for it are fabulous European locations and grand sets. Otherwise, bad acting abounds, with the main culprits being Salman and Katrina. Some of the dialog is ludicrous ("a hard-core anti-family man!!"), and unfortunately uttered with a straight face. Boman Irani is wasted in a clichéd role. Anil Kapoor has some energy but is sidelined for long periods of time. The plot line is incoherent and makes little sense. Quite frankly, the film is a complete waste of time.Overall 1/10" 
" Finally ! a decent movie from Salman , The drought has ended","How about that ? To say the least , Yuvvraaj is a good watch . i just finished watching it . As usual , i thought i would not last even 15 minutes , with the hammed up acting of Salman and the over complicated storyline or absolutely rubbish story with all of his previous releases in 2008 . So i was quite pessimistic with this one too.But surprise , surprise . Even though i am not a big Salmon hammy khan fan , i would have to say honestly , he did give a good performance ,for once i didn't feel cheated by paying to watch a Salmon's movie . He was good so were others . only exception is Zayed khan . as usual he never lets me down . i don't even know why he is acting ? He is a sure bet when it comes to huge letdown on acting. He ruins everything.The story is simple , Its about 3 brothers , Anil , Salmon and Zayed . The 2 Khans aka Salmon and Zayed wish to inherit a huge sum from their fathers estate who dies and leaves the whole inheritance . The catch is the father pulls a fast one and leaves the inheritance to Anil , the eldest one who is Mentally retarded. So as usual the khans gets angry o be weaseled out of the deal. Mithun plays a convincing role of a will attorney who breaks the good news to the brothers that they are conned out of the deal by their dead father. Salman who is a talented chorus singer in Austria is in love with the alluring Katrina ,Awwww. Why cant i get a girl like that . anyhow getting back to the story . Kat is the daughter of Boman Irani who is a wealthy surgeon and does not like Salman . So finally Salmon and Irani sign an accord that states if Salmon becomes a billionaire within 40 days , he will marry Kat or else leave her. on the other hand Salmon on reaching London where gets the happy news about his fathers will from Mithun .And then the story starts , What will Salmon do ? Will he try to con Anil , his elder brother out of his inheritance so that he get the whole estate so that he can marry Kat or will he try to help Anil, his mentally retarded elder brother and save him from Zayed and rest of the family members.Performance wise , i would say its Salmans best performance this year. Anil is a great actor , always has been and he has done a fine work. Mithun shows up here and there but is quite convincing in his role of a high power attorney. The story is good , the songs are good. As stated previously , only Zayed is an eye sore with his extra hammed up so called acting. Salman gives a good performance and for once he keeps his shirt on. Even in the songs . what a surprise.Story wise its a old one , just repacked in a new material , with good scenic Austria as its backdrop. The cast is well chosen and the story goes on In its own pace , smoothly.Guys and gals ! i will be honest . i look at movies as a investment in my leisure time . so it has to be my moneys worth . or else it doesn't matter what the media says or what everyone else says . After the movie ends i should feel that my money was well spent and i am entertained.This movie does so . Its a good watch and i would recommend it . This is a simple story scripted and made so that its digestible Overall i would give it a fun family watch. I will give it a 8/10 . and two thumbs up." 
" Yuvvraaj","I don't know what has happened to Subhash Ghai. You cant believe that he is the same guy who made movies like Karz, Khalnayak, Ram Lakhan and Taal. The thing that was good about the movie was Salman Khan's acting. This is the first movie after Tere Naam where he was not Salman Khan and he was the character that he was playing. However he started as his overacting self but mellowed down as the movie progressed. One thing..... Zayed Khan can't act. There are so many technical flaws in the movie. Anil Kapoor is suffering from Autism and still he manages to understand emotions and speak such deep dialogs like he did in the movie. I guess Subhash Ghai needs to look up the meaning of autism first.Salman Khan is a chorus singer who is not rich... yet he owns a convertible, a sports bike and a big house.I mean OK it is a movie..... directors are allowed some slack but not this.The villains Anjan Srivastava and his daughter in law irritating at all times and they could have been scripted better.In all a bad movie and I feel I wasted my money." 
" Pathetic! Avoid this film.","I saw Yuvvraj today in a theater and I cursed myself for wasting my hard-earned money on such a stupid movie. Zayed Khan cannot act. He should not be acting at all. Katrina Kaif cannot act as well, but she is much better than Zayed Khan. I was actually quite impressed and surprised by Salman Khan. He is the only saving grace of the movie. His performance was good, I cannot call it great, but reasonably good.The storytelling was choppy, the script was confusing and the character development inconsistent and incomplete. The film just jumped from one theme to another and the story didn't flow at all. Towards the end I was like looking at my watch and just waiting for the film to end. It was really a waste of time, energy and money. It was not Subhash Ghai quality at all. I wonder if Subhash Ghai even directed this film, he must have just signed his name on it. The story-telling was so lame.The only things I liked about the movie were cinematography and the songs. Gulzar once again has proved that he is the greatest song writer in India. A.R. Rahman music is quite good too.Overall, avoid this movie. If it comes on T.V. then you can watch it, but don't spend your hard-earned money on this crap!" 
" Subhash is not a 'Yuvvraaj' in Bollywood box-office","I highly expected positive outcome from this film specially after seeing its first trailer in TV and promoting it as a musical. And also deeply impressed with the song Tu Meri Dost Hai from Rahman. But does it really deserve to disappoint its audience? If I think over this question then it is absolutely 'yes', Whenever any Subhash Ghai film is being made, and about to release first thing that comes in my mind is it must have these common subjects associated in the film. These subjects are  family, wealth, tradition and music. In this case Yuvvraaj is also not an exceptional. In brief, the whole story is about three brothers with numerous differences among themselves are in target of owning the rights of their properties after their father's demise. Not only this, besides there is another globe which is concerned to music. After all this is a Shubash Ghai film.At first I have to mention is of casting, which is considerable. Then comes performance. Throughout the whole movie only Anil Kapoor is in his form to entertain the audience from his side though he plays something very unusual role in his career. Even that I didn't expect his unique role before finally catching the film.What to say about Salman!!! He is the one who always play similar type of role which is always related to conspiracy, jealous, bossy and domination. I was so shocked about 2 years before when it was rumoured that he was casted in this film by Shubash Ghai. I couldn't believe it then, but now ultimately I finished watching. OK there is nothing new from Salman in judgment of his performance, character and the role he is offered in Yuvvraaj. His body language, facial expression, speaking manner and dressing looks are not different from his other 10 films. It shows he doesn't commit himself seriously to bring out reality in the character in every movie. It is clear all cannot become either Aamir Khan or Kamal Hassan.Last but not the least of all three brothers Danesh, performed by Zayed Khan. I don't know when will Zayed be offered for an award winning role in his career. Not even a single film I have in mind to prove that he is an excellent actor. His previous flops like Mission Istanbul or Speed were really senseless and lower grade movies. Here too I was completely disappointed by him.But again, Boman Irani is always and all time interesting actor whose sense of humour is precious to any movie where he is involved with. He is really a brilliant actor, and in Yuvvraaj his role could have also done by Anupam Kher, but anyway Boman was an excellent choice. Now come to Subhash Ghai? He has lost his creative ideas and cannot cope up with the present generation audiences, and thus he again provided this kind of outdated script. Moreover these days it is already common in Bollywood stories about brothers rivaling with each other for wealth and money. And this is the exact reason for bombing this movie in box-office. His last movie that audiences as well as critics accepted was his Taal (or before this Pardes which was a masterpiece). It was followed a hat-trick with 3 continuous flops Yaadein, Kisna and Black & White. Now Yuvvraaj reached to fourth serial flop. SO BETTER NOT TO EXPECT MUCH FROM HIM IN THE COMING FUTURE." 
" A Worthwhile Experience from showman with a Blend of family values and Love...","Subhash Ghai's loveliest film in years has a symphonic texture, feel and movement to it. From the opening shots of Katrina Kaif labouring lusciously over the cello to the montage towards the end when Boman Irani, playing a zany surgeon, hops skips and jumps in the hospital corridor to announce the hero's recovery, "Yuvvraaj" reworks old themes of family ties and unequal love matches to suit a new clientele.It says it's okay to want money. But it's not okay to sacrifice family for funds. The palate is passionate. The look, feel and flavour of the presentation are near-exquisite. Ghai's hard-earned reputation as a showman is on show here with shimmering austerity.Placed at the exotic backdrops of Austria, Deven Yuvvraaj (Salman Khan) and Anushka (Katrina Kaif) are in love and as clichéd; her father Dr. Banton (Boman Irani) obstructs their relationship. On the initial stages, it's between Deven-Banton and scenario shifts onto different vistas as Deven's father lasts his breath in London. Not for affection and paying homage, Deven gets back to his hometown seeking for shares in father's wealth. Over there, he encounters his unloved brothers Gyanesh Yuvvraaj (Anil Kapoor) and Danny Yuvvraaj (Zayed Khan).Gyanesh Yuvvraaj possessing autism from his childhood goes the apple-of-eye for everyone in the family, once attorney-close friend of his father (Mithun Chakraborthy) reveals that entire property is favored on him. Not alone Deven and Danny, but other relatives sham themselves to be good with their opprobrious inner evil intentions.What makes the film so colossally spectacular? Undoubtedly, it's melodious tunes of Rahman and Kabir Lal's visualizing of emblazoned locations. Moreover, on-screen actors performing a different show with their distinct roles surmount your prospects. It's a complete show by Anil Kapoor and this man transfixes your with his simpatico-kind-of-role. Be it his mirthful encounters with Salman or the emotional outbreak in the penultimate, he overshadows everyone and each prop in the frame. Don't miss his fabulous gestures after watching handycam in the climax. Hats off to Subash Ghai! His genuineness of inserting symbolic representation where Anil Kapoor breaks the masks on table after viewing handycam is superb. Of course, the song 'Dil Ka Rishta' following this sequence as broken mask at backdrops of stage. It's something you call 'Director's cut'. A new dawn and a great break for Zayed Khan and let him thank Subash for it. Hope, directors watch out for his performance offering him best roles in future. With her cherubic looks and decent performance, Katrina Kaif steals the show and watching her play cello, it looks realistic. No wonder in appreciating her looks alike of Princess Diana at certain parts. Boman Irani pulls your attention with his laudable performance in all contexts, especially in the climax. Aushima Sawhney sways with finesse and ditto to Anjan Srivastava as antagonist. Salman Khan establishes a perfect room with his pleasing act on all scenarios till the final credits (similar to Om Shanthi Om).On narration, Yuvvraaj doesn't start off with a gripping screenplay and perhaps, it's merely bits-n-pieces of lad and missy in love and father opposing their relations. Well, things shift on paradigms once Mithun Chakraborthy appears on the screen and unravels a great surprise amongst other characters. Few flaws of uninteresting parts may be spotted in the first half and everything goes diminished in the penultimate of 20-25mins binding your hearts, soaking eyes with tears and sparkling your lips with smiles. It's very rare amongst auteurs blending different emotions within short durations and Subash Ghai deserves grand appreciations for it. Rahman's musical score is refreshing with 'Tu Hi Meri Dost' and 'Dil Ka Rishta'. Merely, visualizations could have been better for 'Tu Hi Meri Dost' as he could've avoided Computer Generated works. Background score works well, especially where Salman reveals his inner intentions to Anil Kapoor after sipping drinks and penultimate sequences are top-notching. Kabir Lal's cinematography mesmerizes everyone and his enchanting shots of European locales goes in-hand with Rahman's musical. It's a billion dollar question why Subash Ghai had to pass-scenes while characters drive car on such beautiful locales.As a whole, Yuvvraaj is splendiferous in all parts with exceptional performance by all and it's a perfect family entertainer. As in "Pardes" and "Yaadein", Ghai questions joint-family values and the rapidly-changing equations in modern times. While pricking our collective conscience, "Yuvvraaj" rarely throws up a moment when we can't look Ghai's vision straight in the eye. It is among the finest films of 2008." 
" Great movie yet quite dull ??","Subhash Ghai is back after a string of flops Yaadein, Black and white and Kisna. He has made classic films like Karz, Hero, Meri Jung, Karma, Ram Lakhan and Khal Nayak. His latest film has its highs and lows but it mainly has highs and is a overall good film. Basic storyline of 3 brothers , One is mental Anil Kapoor, One is Salman Khan who left his home 15 years ago and the other is the naughty son Zayed Khan. The storyline is partly about their relationship on how they don't care about each other and how or if they bond as brothers, when they come together. They do come together when their father passes away and they want to know who inherits the billions of pounds wealth. Salman Khan delivers a splendid performance and plays his part well, Zayed Khan is great at times and decent at times. Mithun is in this film for a few minutes and the veteran does a good job. Katrina Kaif finally has a better role then usually and does a OK job, but she badly needs to improve her Hindi dialect. Anil Kapoor is fantastic as the mental brother, Does not overact, he is just about right. The movie is quite brilliant, They could of added some more dramatic scenes, but a few boring unnecessary scenes spoils this from being a SUPER HIT." 
" Yuvvraaj is body beautiful of minus soul - yes it is","Veteran filmmaker Subhash Ghai's 'Yuvvraaj' is a body beautiful of minus soul. One expects wonders from this one, reason? A seasoned filmmaker, dream star-cast, music by Oscar- winner A R Rahman, first-rate cinematography. But the film falls short, and the sole reason is the outdated, bland script. Its like going back to school, and asking for new subjects all of a sudden. 'Yuvvraaj' falls short of expectations, no options on that. Unfortunately no Raaj for 'Yuvvraaj'. Pluses of the film: The film has been shot beautifully, thanks to the breath-taking cinematography. Performances are good: Mithun Chakraborty is excellent in a brief role. Anil Kapoor is good. Salman Khan is not in form, he looks least interested in most scenes, the only scene he excels is towards the climax, when Anil goes through an operation. Zayed Khan is decent. Katrina Kaif looks angelic and does an okay job. Boman Irani is superb. Others are alright. Minuses: The script is stale. And that's its biggest minus point.on the whole 'Yuvvraaj' is no royal watch. Letdown!" 
" Has got its merits but misses to hit the right note.","As a big fan of Subhash Ghai, I remember almost 20 years back, buying ticket for the first show of "Ram Lakhan" at double the price and then sitting in a packed houseful show with people whistling, dancing and clapping on every scene and song. And now comes a day when I easily get a ticket for the first show of "Yuvraaj" from the window itself and become a part of few people watching the movie in the theater. There is no excitement in any viewer, no whistles or claps and no dancing around the screen.Surely times have changed a lot, and surprisingly "Subhash Ghai Sir" has also changed his style of film-making. But the sad part is that the change of style is not coming up good enough for the viewers. As witnessed in his last few movies, "Yuvraaj" too has its merits but falls short of the expectations from the famous "Showman" of Bollywood. The discouraging opening response must be due to the unimpressive and confusing promos which were not able to explain what the movie was. Even Salman and Anil looked puzzled in their acts in the on air promos.Coming to the movie itself, it starts off with Salman, Katrina and Boman Irani (as Katrina's father) with their love story angle. 50 minutes into the movie and the same goes on & on with no sign of Anil and Zayed. This makes the viewer restless as it is too lengthy and should have been trimmed heavily. Then with the news of Salman's rich father dying the story moves on and the other two brothers of Salman are introduced, Anil Kapoor & Zayed Khan. After every one is there on the screen the story goes into the "Jaydaad" & inheritors drama with a twist in the form of autistic Anil Kapoor.The locations are fresh, sets are huge, songs are shot lavishly, but nothing hits the right note. Everyone looks playing his part knowingly that something is wrong and not working. There are very few scenes to watch out for and it all seems to be too lengthy and repetitive. The most lacking part is the story and screenplay of the movie which does not give ample scope to any star in particular.The film mainly moves around Salman & Katrina with Anil Kapoor taking the limelight post interval. Salman Khan & Katrina look good as a couple but it is not one of their best movies. However, I liked Salman in the last scene when he cries in front of Boman to save the life of his brother Anil. He never looks like acting in the scene and proves that he has got the talent too along with the fab body. The scene where Katrina is playing and teasing topless Salman shows their off screen bonding clearly. Katrina has a fresh look but her hair style could have been better. Anil Kapoor as usual is almost perfect but at places repeats his "Eeshwar" act. Actually Anil gets betrayed by the script and hence his character fails to strike the emotional chord with the viewer. Zayed Khan still relies more on his looks than his acting. Boman Irani is a bit loud but calms down in his last scene with Salman. Mithun Da in a guest appearance enjoys his few scenes with elegance.Like in his earlier movies, "Yuvraaj" also has a rich family with a Mama ji, cunning uncles, brothers, loyal servants and a vamp bhabhi. Here the bhabhi is too hot to handle and has the looks to kill. Climax is the least convincing part with a twist told so many times before where the performer is poisoned before his main grand show. Even the song is not enjoyable enough for the grand finale. Till you reach the climax you lose interest in the happenings and wish the movie was only around Salman and Katrina.Apart from the fresh cinematography, the other major highlight of the film is the music of A. R. Rahman. Though this time the magic of "Taal" is missing and the music needs time to grow on the listener. Two songs score over all the others with "Tu Hi Meri Dost Hai" being the best. The songs may not be that entertaining for the Indian audience as they are designed giving more stress on Western Arrangements. Honestly I also cannot rate this as one of Rahman's best as i was expecting much more from the combination of Rahman & Ghai.In few words, I again found the "Golden Touch of Subhash Ghai" missing in this. But if you are a Salman-Katrina fan then you will surely enjoy their lovable screen presence together." 
" Copied Rainman","This moive's main idea is from english movie Rainman" 
" Thoroughly enjoyed this film.","This movie was a treat with its fabulous actors and such brilliant music. I had read such negative reviews of this film yet decided to take a chance on it and I'm glad I did. Superb acting by all actors except Zayed Khan (he was overacting) but other than him the rest of the actors did a wonderful job. Last and not the least, the music, it was BRILLIANT. That was the best part and should be so because music plays an important role in this film. It was actually hurtful to see so many negative reviews." 
" Beautiful genre but long","Movie gives a mind blowing start Salman Katrina everything is we needed is here in movie
But a major lack of movie is that it's duration if unwanted scenes of 8-9 mins would be deleted than movie will be good enough for duration also but now it's not possible because movie wass released a decade ago but no doubt
Salman Khan is quiet good actor.." 
" A Musical Pleasure but Average movie","(1st paragraph may contain spoiler) I wish Subhash Ghai could have tightened the storyline a bit. Zayed Khan and the rest of the supporting cast were unnecessary for the movie. The focus could have just been on Anil Kapoor as a musical genius and Salman Khan as the brother who does not like him and Katrina Kaif who encourages his talent and Boman Irani not wanting Salman to marry his daughter. The inheritance part made no sense at all. (end of spoiler) Usually Mr.Subhash Ghai brings out a whole new personality in the actors that act for his movies. Only Anil Kapoor fits the bill. Mr. Subhash Ghai wanted to be about music and brotherly love. The music aspect was the strongest part in the movie where as the brotherly love fell short.Actors/ Cast Members: Katrina Kaif: Her acting is very sticky and looks uncomfortable. She seems more comfortable in commercial films like Singh is Kinng and Welcome so this sudden change is awkward. Moreover, she could not even speak in Hindi properly for this film and ended up switching to English. Since the setting for Subash Ghai movies require proper Hindi speakers, Katrina Kaif was just too modern for the role.Salman Khan is alright. He plays his typical character who usually has anger management problem so there is nothing fresh in his acting. There was no room for him to grow in his character. Anil Kapoor was the best. His role was totally different and very entertaining. He proved that Mr.Ghai could bring a new personality to his actors. Zayed Khan: He also plays the same typical arrogant character so there is nothing special about him. He barely had anything to do except dance. I really think Zayed should explore different roles like Vaada or Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne. Boman Irani is another lifesaver. His comic acting provides relief to the movie. Supporting Cast have no role at all. They were just placed to extend screen time. A.R.Rahmanji: The songs beautiful and well made. There is a mix of Western instruments blended with Indian lyrics which is Rahmanji's forte. There are catchy tunes is each song and overall the music does justice to the movie. The voices fit very well to each of the character. The costumes and choreography were wonderful. Storyline: The concept started off as a great idea. Unfortunately, the execution was terrible. The plot was watery and there was no substance. Moreover, the main characters except for Boman Irani and Anil Kapoor were not given a chance to show justice to their characters. There is no dept in any of the characters, making it a boring 3 hour movie with just music to look forward to. Cinematography: It was nice and different and a change of scenery. Suggestions: I think Mr. Subhash Ghai should redo his script cutting unnecessary parts and compressing it. It would have been more successful & well received." 
" Yuvvraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaj","Yuvvraaj,directed by Subhash Ghai is a amazingly painful.It has a message,but it takes so long to reach the final point.Subhash Ghai extends the movie so much with many unwanted scenes. Eg:-The family of Salman Khan.They are so ironically dreadful.Or even the scenes involving Salman and Boman(Katrina's father) were wasted.Even the songs,though shot lavishly are so long.They bore you.Subhash Ghai's direction is dreadful.The music is a bore.The cinematographer excels.The DoP too excels.Performance wise-Salman Khan looks disinterested.Anil Kapoor blows your mind off.Katrina Kaif only smiles.Zayed Khan needs improvement.Boman Irani irritates.Anjaan Srivastav and the rest for the family are purely wasted.Mithun Chakraborty is fine in an special appearance.Overall Yuvvraaj has style but lacks substance." 
" An other disaster from Bollywood.","Bollywood's bad PR continues with the release of this movie.Plus Great cinematography and good music score. Beautiful locations and grand sets.Spoilers This movie is so lame! Terrible repeating of the same background music score. Bad acting by Salman and Katrina. Zalman Khan, you can't act! Katrina Kaif can only smile like a barby doll. Terrible overacting by Anil Kapoor, an autist who understands emotion. It seems like the director has thought that a consistent story doesn't count and just focus on picturizing and cast nice laughing people who overacts like idiots.Please Bollywood stop producing this kind of horror. From now on I will only watch movie of Mira Nair, Vidhu Chopra and Farhan Akhtar's."
