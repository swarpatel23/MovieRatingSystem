" For your encouragement","With such a title Director Anees Bazmee expresses his gratitude towards that limited loyal audience who came to see this film by saying â€“Thank you which means- "You again tolerated my same routine stuff without much of a complaint. Good, I will continue making remakes of my own film No Entry (2005) as well as David Dhawan's Shaadi No.1 and you please don't stop watching them." My suggestion to Anees Bhai is make one more such film with Akshay Kumar and keep its title as SEE YOU AGAIN. I bet, people will again take title of your film seriously though not your film and will throng the theaters. But please don't forget to send me a cut in the profits of your next film as for the same content, I am suggesting you a fresh title at least." 
" Re-entry","Hail Irrfan Khan and his comic timing.It's not thank you . it's re-entry. Just the same successful formula of 'no entry' has been repeated. While making a lol entertainer it goes beyond it realms and ridicules the sanctity of relationships and marriages. In it's account of relationships it seems to be very one sided. But an objective look at relationship can never be expected from Anees Bazmee. The movie does what was expected from it - makes you laugh real hard. A large share of laughs come for Irrfan's performance. He proves once again his mantle and versatility in acting. His comic timing is phenomenal. The kind which Akshay kumar once showed in Mujse shadi Karogi. But as it has been for quite some time his performance seems repetitive. As for others, bobby acts bad as usual, Suniel overacts as usual again. Sonam kaoor irritates with cardboard character. Reema sen surprises with her quirkiness. Celia jaitley is hardly there. Songs are just burden as usual yet again. The ending goes overboard and tries to make a pigheaded soulless movie into a serious inquisition into relationships and fails miserably. The only low point of movie comes at the end.This movie just belongs to Irrfan's incredible comic timing and Anees Bazmee's ability to pen funny insincere jokes. A timepass. :)" 
" The apt title of the movie should have been SORRY.","In few words if I am asked to write about THANK YOU then I would say - There must be many young energetic directors working as under-employed or struggling on the roads of Mumbai for their one chance, capable of giving a much better movie than this present one coming from Aneez Bazmee. And why I am very much confident in this statement, that's because you cannot go more wrong than THANK YOU.In other words, in this net age of digital entertainment, it's a shame that our directors and producers still consider 'we viewers' as brain dead, desperate and silly to accept such kind of utter crap. What a waste of precious resources both for the makers and as well as the viewers?Sometimes I really feel confused that do these actors, directors or producers ever see their own self-made film in the theater before releasing it? And if they really do then Is there nobody who can tell them that what they have actually made and how its going to do at the box office? On second thoughts a film like THANK YOU clearly confirms that the Industry is full of mean and self-concerned persons who would never reveal you the real truth and would only appreciate you and your product at your face.Content wise, the film has nothing new in the name of a story and is mere an extension of films such as NO ENTRY, PARTNER & MASTI made on the subject of cheating husbands and their escape routes. So it's indeed very surprising that its whole team of writers and director decided to just repeat the subject and nothing else. In fact the opening few minutes are only ones when you enjoy the most and then the rest purely makes you repent. Besides the last moment addition to the script, where Vidya Balan comes in as a special appearance simply makes you think, "What the hell is happening?". Musically, it's a very average kind of score from the otherwise good Pritam, which also gets full support from some highly low standard and weird lyrics. Cinematography is nothing above the usual and background score doesn't give you anything to take notice of itself.In the acting department, there is only one saving grace of the movie and he is Irfan Khan, who remains the only person who is able to make you laugh at times and that's it. Other than Irfan the entire cast can easily put this film in the list of their worst choices made. Akshay seriously needs a break which specifically needs to be a more educative break for him where he should learn how to judge a product after having so much experience in the field by his side. I agree you cannot predict or judge a Hit, but you can surely sense a BAD film coming your way without any doubt. Though he looks smart and young in the film doing his role well, but unfortunately that is not enough for the audience who come to the theater with their own set of expectations. Supporting Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty tries very hard and Bobby Deol seems to be completely lost somewhere else.Among the ladies, it's the worst film of Sonam till date where she is really looking awful at places with very poor make up and looks. As reported in the news, she very much looks like ill and tired throughout the film. Celina Jaitely is hardly there in the movie but Rimi Sen gives her best to her allotted role. Both Mallika Sherawat in the item number and Vidya Balan in the climax are wasted and the film could have easily been made without their deliberate insertions.In all, after the end credits role, one starts thinking that the apt title of this film should have been SORRY instead of THANK YOU and I think that explains it all." 
" Not that bad.","I went to watch this movie with very low expectations thinking it to be another vulgar/cheap comedy that Bollywood has been making on cheating husbands. But I was pleasantly surprised. The story is about three couples where the husbands fool their wives and have extra-marital affairs and how the wives get back at their husbands using the help of a private detective.Needless to say, Irrfan Khan is the best in the movie. He does a good job and has a good comic timing. Other actors (Akshay Kumar, Rimi Sen, Bobby Deol)have also done a fair job. Sonam Kapoor (whom I don't like much) is tolerable. It's fun to watch and the scenes between Irrfan and Rimi are good. Not a great movie but an enjoyable one!" 
" Laugh Riot!","This was simply a great movie with marvelous comedy. Irfan Khan stole the show and Akshay Kumar was mind blowing. Bobby Deol did a nice job and so did Sunil Shetty. "Main Kisna Hoon" was one of the funny parts of this movie. Also, Munni and Sheila have been bumped with Razia. The song Razia was amazing. People who like comedies will enjoy this. Akshay came back from his bad comedy in "TMK" with "Thank You" as well as Aneez Bazmee coming back from "No Problem". The actresses did well in their parts, Celina Jaitely and Rimi Sen did well. Sonam Kapoor looked beautiful. This was very well done. Personally 10/10. Most people who do not like comedies would rate it as 6/10 (average)." 
" A Nutshell Review: Thank You","It's been rather quiet on the Bollywood mainstream front given the build up and subsequent hangover with India winning the Cricket World Cup, but I suppose releases will be back on track soon, with one of the earliest off the blocks being Anees Bazmee's Thank You, a typical comedy broaching on the topic of marriage infidelity starring one of the most hardworking and overexposed stars in Akshay Kumar in an ensemble together with Bobby Deol, Suniel Shetty, Irrfan Khan, Sonam Kapoor, Celina Jaitley and Rimi Sen.So shouldn't it sound like fun, given a bevy of stars in situational set ups about philandering husbands who fool around behind their wives' backs, and having their own support group set up as credible alibis. Bobby Deol's Raj manages to fool his wife Sanjana (Sonam Kapoor) with his sweet nothings, his boss Vikram (Irrfan Khan) overpowers his submissive wife Karthika (Rimi Sen) with unreasonable demands, probably because the latter wants to continue enjoying the high life thanks to her husband's booming luxury yacht business. Then there's Suniel Shetty as Yogi, perhaps the least skillful of the lot, being caught out by wife Radha (Celina Jaitley), and also because of the latter's engagement of a private investigator Kishen (Akshay Kumar) who she introduces to Sanjana to wake the simpleton to see beyond the wool pulled over her eyes.Honestly, the first half of the film before the interval is the stronger portion of the story, and probably where it's most fun given the interesting battle of wits premise set, even though it was not exploited to the full extent. With Radha and Sanjana reluctantly engaging Kishen's services, the latter is adamant in exposing the three husbands in one fell swoop, but discovers that the counter-brilliance of the mastermind Vikram won't make this an easy walk in the park. Strategies get employed involving technology, divide and conquer tactics to make the guys turn on one another, and frankly the set comedic pieces hit more than missed. The complication arises when the guys also engages Kishen's services, and find out that he too is a ladies man, though his loyalties, under wraps, belong to his earlier employers.A small romantic subplot also involved Kishen and Sanjana with a hint of a conflict of interest from the get go that was cursory at best, and the remaining saving grace of the film belonged to the chemistry between Irrfan and Bobby Deol as buddies who find their lifestyle under threat. But it all spiraled downward after the interval with plenty of melodrama being poured into it such as the tired and silly suicide attempt of Sanjana at the Niagara Falls (this was partly shot in Toronto and Vancouver), and when Kishen progresses into his next role as a pseudo-marriage counsellor out to teach the guys a thing or two about fidelity, and reconciliation. However I suspect that the jokes here were less slapstick and direct, relying on funny dialogue that got lost in translation through the subtitles, which was a pity for non- Hindi speakers like myself.Song and dance sequences were nothing to shout about unfortunately, even with Mallika Sherawat popping up as an item girl in Razia. No subtitles came with the lyrics to the songs, so I'm left to my own devices to determine what shenanigans the characters were into. Would have been a much engaging film if the second half managed to keep pace with the eclectic first, but instead opting for a more conventional approach and finale that makes you wonder why the females can't just walk out of a relationship that is already on rocky grounds no thanks to mistrust and dishonesty, lessons learnt notwithstanding." 
" two back to back hits after many flops after Singh Is Kingh","Thank You is another hit after Patiala House which is good after many stupid delivered crap like Tees Maar Khan, Khatta Meetha, Action Replayy and many more. To be honest, no matter how many Akki movies are flops, he is always the best for. Coming to the Movie, very similar to No Entry and the story is not much different as Anees Bazmee directed both films. Here also, we have husbands who do funny or silly things to hide the truth from their wives. The womenizers are in trouble as Akki the private detective is helping solve the case, there are many funny scenes in between and all of them do get caught. But, they are all straightened out by the end and Akki mentions the problem he had and why he wants to bring all these kind of men on the right path. Thank You is another suceesful comedy film, Anees Bazmee makes his promise of another hit after the disaster No Problem. Actors are very convincing with their acting and the comedy is well timed unlike Tees Maar Khan which was total crap. The music was really good even though some are sung using the nose, Pyaar Do Pyaar Lo was the best song. The action is funny and great, Akki stills knows how to fight well after the 90's. The rest is just about great, no flaws at all. Overall, another great film in 2011. Hopefully, Akki's upcoming movie Joker and Helloo India will do even better than this." 
" Don't Listen To What People Are Saying WATCH IT !!! !!! !!! !!!","I don't know why ppl have given this movie such bad ratings but the truth is this that if U don't watch this movie U r going to miss out on all the fun !! I am very strict when it comes to reviews but this had to be the best comedy flick in a Loooooooooooooooooooooooong time !! JUST WATCH IT !! and ppl like TARAN ADARSH should go and kill themselves ... they don't know how to write reviews .... Yes its true that this movie didn't do good at the box office ... but that doesn't mean JACK !! I thought SULTANAT was one of the greatest movies ever but it was a flop !! go judge for ureselves and watch it ..!! Thank me later !!" 
" Thank You","Akshay Kumar and Irfan Khan at their best.... Standup performance by Sunil Shetty , Gr8 acting by Bobby Deol, Fantastic performance by Rimi Sen and Sonam Kapoor and no comments on Celina Jaitly .Three womanizers Raj(Bobby), Vogi(sunil) n Vikram(Irfan) fool their wife's then carry affairs with other gals.... Sanjana(sonam) who is raj's wife gets suspicious about his affairs, so she hires Kisen( Akshay ) to spy on them. He makes Sanjana realize that Raj is cheating on him.But however Sanjana Loves Raj and wants him back. Akshay Kumar tries everything he can to unite them all. Also a flashback of Akshay's tragic life is shown which has Vidya Balan playing a cameo.Music is great like Pyar do pyar lo already hitting the chart busters, Full volume is also good. Especially the flute music play by Akshay is mind soothing.Why should you watch it? - Cuz its a fantastic movie and has great performances of Akshay Kumar , Irfan Khan , Bobby Deol and Sunil Shetty.Why should you not watch it?? :- nothing. You will only hate the critics after watching the movie.But the dance sequences are not of the standard.Verdict: Thank You will keep everyone entertained.So overall movie i go with 10/10. A good movie to watch and I tell THANK YOU to Aneez Bazmee for giving such a good movie." 
" pretty good","I couldn't wait to watch this movie but after reading the reviews it put me off. I still watched cause it had my favorite actor in it Akshay.Akshay was fully awesome looked awesome, acted awesome and was awesome. Bobby Deol did a good performance Suneil was alright Iffran had great comic timing and was very funny. Sonam Kapoor did a good job nothing to special Rimi Sen was good she was pretty funny at some parts. Celina not reallyThe music was pretty good Pyaar do Pyaar Lo was my favorite. Aksahay in the movie would play the flute a lot and the tune he played was very nice and soothing.The movies first half was pretty fun and good but could've been done better but still entertaining. The second half wasn't as good and fun but definitely some parts that got you laugh quite a lot and the rest of the time quite a few chuckles and smiles to keep you entertained.Not Akshays best movie he's done much funnier. Not Aneez Bazmees best but way better than his last movie No problem. Overall definitely an entertaining movie that will keep you entertained and smiling throughout the movie." 
" Beep You","'No thanks' would be the proper response if someone proposes that you watch this junk. Anees Bazmee has made another garbage that's not only highly offensive to women but also an insult to people's basic intelligence. Of course, I expect this from Akshay Kumar and Bazmee (who, as it seems, is incapable of making a decent film) so I would have skipped this but some of my relatives are fans of Kumar and so it was more about spending time with the family and laughing at the awfulness of 'Thank You'. While I did predict it to be awful, I thought it would be one of those so-bad that it's funny. However, the way the woman are portrayed as weak AND stupid is unforgivable. Anyway, needless to say, the writing is horrendous. Akshay Kumar is okay where acting is concerned but he offers nothing new. Irfan Khan steals the show as he reveals his comic side once again. Of the women, Rimi Sen stands out in a non-challenging role. Bobby Deol, Sonam Kapoor and Celina Jaitly are bad. Of course, like many rich Bollywood directors, Bazmee is ashamed of India, so the film is poorly shot in Canada. The songs, like in most recent Akshay Kumar films, are dreadful.Oh well, as a viewer, I wouldn't consider myself completely blameless as I did choose to watch this trash, expecting to at least laugh a bit and poke fun but alas! No thanks to Bazmee and his team." 
" Timepass Movie Without Any Freshness","Thank you is a funny time-pass flick,which seems as it is a sequel to No Entry by Aneez Bazmee himself.Director Anees Bazmee could not bring out any freshness to the plot and has created another feel good-go movie with some hilarious moments like No Entry.Irrfan khan is the best among the lead with some witty one-liners and perfect comic timing.Bobby Deol has done justice to his role and creates some hilarious moments but turns angry and humorless in the second half.Sunil Shetty has proved his comical excellence once again after flicks like phir hera pheri and one two three.Akshay Kumar does a charming role with a cool persona;but lacks freshness.Sonam Kapoor looks as if she has terribly gone wrong in her makeup;but does an o.k performance.Rimi Sen is the best among the female leads and her chemistry with Irrfan is the best part of the film which could evoke lot of laughs.Celina Jaitley is absent in the film for a major part of the story and has nothing much to offer.Music by Pritam is in tone with the theme and the songs Pyaar Do Pyaar Lo and Pyaar Mein stands out in the album.The song in the flashback scene,which is absent in the music album is melodious and soothing.some +ves:: The flute theme of the movie,which has a magical freshness- Good choreography of the songs-Irrfan's comic timing-Editing by Steven H Bernardsome -ves:: The flashback scene in the climax which seems too senseless-Timing of the songs;especially in the second half-Similarity of story to that of many films like No Entry and other films which is based on extra-marital affairs.Verdict::Thank you has nothing new to offer for the audience;but seems as a time-pass movie which has some hilarious moments and can evoke some laughs.Go for it if you are on a festival mood. Ma Rating::6.5/10" 
" Awful","I used to be a Akshay Kumar fan up until last year but the recent flurry of films with poor acting, poor scripts and already done jokes and sequences have turned me around. This is just another one in the series if not the worst, well worst would be Tees Maar Khan but this is no better. Good thing it was free on Netflix but I still wasted 2 hours of my Friday. It starts bad, stays bad and ends the same way, the songs are mediocre at best, the script has been done a dozen times before, not even a single scene where you would laugh on your own, mostly forced jokes and poor sequences are irritating sometimes, towards the end of it you just wish it ends quickly and you can get over with it. The only saving grace in the movie is Irfan and towards the end, it gets too much for even him to drag the movie, given the limited footage he has in the movie." 
" Old Dairy Milk chocolate wrapped and presented in a new Ferrero Rocher wrapper! Outer presentation differs, but taste would continue to remain intact!!!!","Same old concept of fairy man descending and trying to bring "Gyaan " to men who can't be loyal to their wives!!! Have we not seen enough movies around this???? When movies like ,"No Entry","Partner", "Garam Masala" and "Heyy Babyy" were released, they were instant hits, as the concept was a welcome change, far different from the usual Bollywood "running around the trees" drama. Slowly, many movie makers caught upon this concept , and made several similar movies , with different actors delivering out the same message , only with the label" Original story"..!!! Akshay Kumar has acted in several movies on this concept. An actor at his caliber, having achieved so much fame and great movies to his credit, a movie like "Thank you" not only typecast him to one bracket , it also has a serious impact on his fan expectations! He is known to deliver new things in each of his movie, and fans crave for him more!!But a movie like this only adds a flop to his huge list of hits! The movie does make you laugh. But these jokes have been heard and seen, and there is nothing original!!Akshay Kumar tries to carry on the movie on his shoulder, and tries his best.The rest as I said, nothing new at all!! If you do not mind, spending for a movie which has been shown time and again, then definitely this movie maybe a one-time watch(And as the last option only!!). Hope to see more of Akshay Kumar in better movies and eagerly await the day he springs huge surprises by his performances..." 
" Thank You: For such a humour, no thanks!","Movie: Thank You Rating: 1.5/5Nowadays it has become a trend to make films with adult themes and they are made to release for unrestricted public exhibition, but with parental guidance. Thank you has vulgarity and humour in its roots. Its not a bad movie, but you know that excess of anything is bad.And thus it becomes a bit difficult to watch the film with family.The story, locations and performances, along with music are the plus points of this film. Otherwise, the type of comedy you get to see at places is quite vulgar and rude. Only a bit of clean comedy is there.Akshay Kumar gives a nice performance, but the excess vulgarity kills the role and the goodness in his role. Sunil Shetty provides a bit of clean humor, especially when he's happy, and the best one, when he is framed. Bobby Deol does too much of vulgarity. The film has this in excess that you think how come Censor Board gave this film a clean UA certificate?But the story and music are nice. Akshay Kumar and his flute too are a positive point for the film. But however, the film fails to captivate family audiences for long.Overall, Thank You is an averagely made film that could have been better if it lacked vulgarity. However, if you can still tolerate the vulgarity, you may watch it once, and that too alone. Otherwise, just avoid it." 
" timepass movie","Typical Akshay Kumar movie.....Lots of semi-naked phoren babes--and shots of Akki cavorting with them ( what else ? ) , like they are in aaaaaalllllll of Akki's films .To join him this time are Bobby ( out of work ) Deol , Irrfan Khan ( can a bollywood movie do without a Khan nowadays ? ) and Suniel Shetty ( even the change of name from Sunil to Suniel wont change the luck of this non-actor ,the way it has for Irfan to Irrfan ).All are sleazy guys who get caught by their wives cheating with other women and end up to ask help from Akki , who himself is a womanizer ( so whats new about Akshay , even in real life )Little do they know that Akshay is upto games of his own.......The movie is funny in some parts , though the ending is corny .Verdict--okay for some timepass."
