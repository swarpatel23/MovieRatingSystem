" Nothing new to offer","Mujhse Dosti Karoge (MDK) is a very polished, perfected and stylish movie that we have all come to expect and love from the Yash Chopra banner. But having watched the movie it became evident that though it was from the Yash Chopra banner, it was not a Yash Chopra movie. Don't get me wrong here, it's a movie worth watching  great picturisation, good songs, nice clothes, foreign locations, a love triangle and a young & hip cast. BUT it is not much different from the other run-of-the-mill love stories, and nothing makes it standout from the crowd as a Yash Chopra venture would have.The story is simple (but a little flawed at times)  three friends grow up in a small town in India, but Raj moves away to the UK with his parents. He sends regular emails to Tina, but unknowingly gets responses from Pooja. Through these responses he falls for the girl he thinks is Tina, but in reality is Pooja. When he finally realizes the truth, tragedy strikes and peoples morals are tried and tested and true love wins.
Rani looks fab. She is the embodiment of a sexy lady. She dresses very well, can relate to the character and acts very naturally. Kareena is all Kareena and what we have come to expect from her. She is very well suited to the crazy, bratty girl (remember Po from K3G) but falls flat on her face when it comes to emotional and challenging roles. Hrithik is good in the role and has done the role some justice. Support staffs are just part of the background. The songs are good and with the times, however the mixed medley is really good to see, we should definitely have more of them in movies to come. Overall an entertaining movie, but definitely not a classic or a milestone in Indian cinema." 
" I absolutely love this movie! One of my favorites.","I feel the title is perfect for the movie. The story line is brilliant. Real emphasis on how deep friendship goes and also sacrifices that you will make for friends and loved ones, as well as honoring the value of friendship even when they have passed on. The fact that money and riches didn't change them as people but in fact made the bond of friendship stronger, I felt was good. Brings forth good upbringing, values, morals and great respect for elders. Also respect that the parents have for their children by allowing them freedom of choice. It is a light-hearted movie but also intense in some scenes, which I loved. Great dialogue and brilliant performances from the entire cast. Lovely songs and the dancing was very good. Definitely a must see and also to add to your collection." 
" Chef Kunal Kohli's recipe prepared exclusively for CANDYFLOSS, the Chopra chain of restaurants, is recommended only for the sweet-film toothed","Here's presenting the recipe of MUJHSE DOSTI KAROGE prepared by Chef KUNAL KOHLI exclusively for CANDYFLOSS, the CHOPRA chain of restaurants: Borrow the basic story idea from DTPH (or any triangular love story). Use a dash of KKHH in the first half and SAAJAN in the second. Some glimpses of DDLJ as per taste. Take Kareena's entry and her father's death sequences from K3G. Add the MAINE PYAR KIYA inspired song parody sequence and end it hurriedly, inspired from K2H2 again. Add the regular YASH CHOPRA sauces i.e. melodious music and cool choreography. Garnish it with foreign locales, jazzy costumes and grandeur sets. MDK is ready. The CHOPRA restaurant also gives you an extra papad (Uday Chopra) free of cost.So the story is about 3 friends, who are separated in their childhood. Raj (Hrithik) shifts to London and from there mails regularly to Tina (Kareena), who isn't much interested in replying. All those emails are replied by Pooja (Rani) but under the name of Tina (Well I suppose the net wasn't introduced in India about 15 years from now). Raj comes to India and gradually falls in love with Tina, but when he realizes that all those letters were written by Pooja his heart suddenly flips over towards her in less than a second (like they say, Hrithik Ki Tarah, o sorry, girgit Ki Tarah rang badal na). Then starts the triangle. Finally friends become lovers and lovers become friends. And when it comes to Hindi cinema, there isn't much difference between the two terms.Film-critic-turned-director Kunal Kohli handles many sequences with sensitivity but relies too heavily on the tried and tested stuff. Like the climax that shows a pinch full of sindoor falling on Rani's forehead appears way too clichéd. Moreover Words like farz, vaada, saccha pyar, qurbani are bandied about so many times that they lose their significance.Finally the movie clearly belongs to Rani Mukherjee who has the meatiest role comparatively and does full justice to it. Hrithik is good but suffers from Shahrukh hangover at times. Kareena's role is just an extension of what she did in K3G.Recommended only for the sweet-film toothed." 
" An irritating retell of an old story....","The plot is one that has been told so many times before in Indian Cinema, and sadly, this adaption of the story, to be honest, sucks.Hrithik Roshan does a fairly good job as his character, Raj. However, he overacts for basically half the film. Rani was wasted.,. Kareena Kapoor, another wasted actor - she could have done much better. Apart from exposure, a few crying sequences, a couple of songs, and looking pretty, Kareena also had barely anything to display. This film is not one of Kunal Kohli's better ones. He did a much better job with Hum Tum.Oh well, I guess we all make mistakes...." 
" Nothing new here, but entertains nevertheless.","Mujhse Dosti Karoge is a romantic flick that guarantees to give the audience the quality in the banner of Yash Copra production. Raj (Hrithik Roshan), Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) and Tina (Kareena Kapoor) are friends since childhood. Raj always has a crush to Tina, even he and his family must leave to London, he keep send Tina e-mail. But, the ultra-chick Tina doesn't have any mood to replying it, so she gives the task to Pooja. So, all the times, in 15 years, Pooja keep writing email to Raj by the name of Tina. The love triangle comes as result, when eventually Raj coming back to Simla. From here, we've already know where is the film going to, even when the film hasn't started yet. Notwithstanding of that, Mujhse Dosti Karoge is a slick and hip product. The tension that the film offer is builds the mood of the viewers. Just don't expect any new story here. Just prepare your self to be entertains in a romantic ways, and you'll get the expectation. 7/10" 
" Heart warming","Usually I'm the first to criticise Indian movies for their lack of storyline, songs & attempts to rip of most films from English/European speaking backgrounds. However this movie pleasantly surprised me, finally a movie that actually made sense (although a lil' predictable) about the connection between love and marrying your soulmate. Hrithik Roshan is convincing as the heart torn Raj & Rani Mukherjee definitely is fantastic as the best friend/soulmate Pooja. I think the purpose of Kareena Kapoor was to show some skin and that Indians have some style. Well too be honest I highly doubt that other Indians would seriously walk around in skimpy clothing without first being burnt at the stake!There was chemistry between Hrithik & Rani which made the storyline more convincing, and you truly felt for them right up til' the very end of the movie.One huge flaw- Stop using the names Raj/Tina/Pooja, don't Indians have any other names?" 
" true love conquers over all","this movie was a really nice movie! rani did an awesome job playing Pooja. She was basically the star in this movie. this movie has similarities to Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Tina portrays Tina, Rahul portrays Raj,and Anjali portrays Pooja and Aman Mehra portrays Rohan. The only difference is that rani comes back and plays the character that closely resembles Anjali's character from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai(she was Tina in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai),instead of Shahrukh khan we have Hrithik Roshan,and instead of Rani playing tina in MDK...Kareena plays her. The song Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is in the medly,one of the songs in the movie.The thing i dont understand is why Raj didnt fall in love w/Pooja at first. She was the one who always loved him." 
" Yashraj and Hrithik's first flop together","Yashraj is considered to be the most prime bollywood production house but however their few films are really notable. Mujhse Dosti Karoge released in 2002 starring Hrithik Roshan who was still trying to gain his foothold, he had a superhit debut but post that his career was going downhill, this film took it further down Kareena was going through a repetitive Poo Phase while Rani too was struggling. The film like most Yashraj films is shot abroad, larger then life sets, characters are dressed stylishly whether there are poor or rich. This film was also directed by Kunal Kohli who was a film critic before perhaps after watching this film he would never criticise a film again. The storyline is pretty ordinary, Raj, Pooja and Tina are childhood friends played by Hrithik Rani and Kareena respectively, Raj goes abroad but promises that he will keep in touch through internet(in 1992, 10 years since the film is set). How realistic YRF films are!!!!! Anywayz when they get old after years, Raj comes back The twist in the tale is it was Rani's character chatting with Hrithik whom he mistakes to be Kareena and then some typical song n dance till the twist is revealed. The film follows a predictable format and has clichés and melodrama. Nothing really worthwhile to speak about. The director also adds Uday Chopra as the second lead, the Salman Khan kinda character from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. The climax is perhaps the worst climaxes in a love triangleDirection is nothing great, thank god Kunal gave us Hum Tum after 2 years Music was typical Yrf, though Jaane Dil Mein is decent, the medley leaves a lot to be desiredHrithik Roshan was repeating himself, film after film except Mission Kashmir, FIZA though he plays well in emotional scenes yet he needed a makeover Rani Mukherjee gets the meatiest part and does a good job Kareena Kapoor was getting irritating with her same Poo act she did over and over again, she gets also the lesser role Uday Chopra gets a sidey role and is nothing great Kiran Kumar, Satish Shah and others are okay" 
" A great film!","Mujhse Dosti Karoge tells the story of three childhood friends Raj, Tina and Pooja. When they are all children, Raj and his family leave India to go to London. Before leaving for London, Raj, Tina and Pooja meet up one last time. During this meeting Raj asks Tina to write to him. Tina's mind is elsewhere and she agrees with a distracted mind. Pooja also wants to write to Raj yet Raj only has eyes for Tina. When Raj's first email arrives Tina and Pooja read it together.Pooja pushes Tina to write back but Tina is uninterested so Pooja writes back signing off using Tina's name. Pooja continues to pretend she is Tina through her letters and her friendship with Raj blossoms. 15 years later, Raj and his family return to India for a two week holiday. Pooja tells Tina about the letter and Tina agrees to pretend she has written the letters. \ Raj has already fallen in love with Tina (actually Pooja)without even seeing her. During the two weeks Raj tries to make Tina fall for him like he has fallen for her. Pooja has fallen in love with Raj however keeps her feelings to herself. Raj and her become close friends and he discovers she shares many of his interests however he doesn't doubt that the letters were indeed written by Tina. Meanwhile, Raj's father sees how much Raj has fallen for Tina and fixes his marriage to Tina. Tina hears the news and instantly falls in love with Raj. After two weeks Raj and his family return to London. Pooja arrives in London shortly after to give an interview for a university. She meets Raj there and while showing her the sights of London he discovers the truth behind the letters. Pooja confesses her feelings for Raj and they resolve to go back to India to tell everyone the truth. However, fate intervenes and on their arrival they discover that Tina's father has died. Pooja realizes that if she told everyone about Raj and her, Tina would be crushed as she now had no father or mother. What will Pooja do? Will she sacrifice her love for friendship? Who will get the man of their dreams? Tina or Pooja?" 
" Good acting from Hritik Roshan","The story is good enough, but India always make it long. I like Rani character in here, she's very adorable. Hritik very handsome man and good dancer. Kareena she always look hot and look like Kharisma sometimes (not her act just her face).This is the first time Hritik play become so emotional person to love someone, but can not with her because he already promise to marry her best friend. His quality acting can be prove in this movie.
But to bad Bollywood's always made simple happy ending, not like Hollywood's. I like this movie, but can they make Kareena not giving up so fast and very easy. Because I'm boring with simple ending and without sadness knowing that Hritik love her best friend." 
" It's about t9ime!!!!!!!","Its about time Rani Mukherjee finally gets the man!!! She plays such sympathetic "good" characters but also gets left at the altar or takes second best.The musical and dance medley near the end of the movie was superb. (IMDB should include a list of the songs used in trivia or movie connections.) An Indian friend told me she used to dance to these songs when younger.The romantic plot is typical Bollywood but with an interesting modern twist. I must admit I would be getting tired of these plots if it were not for the music and dance numbers which I love. It takes great plot, great acting, great music and great dancing to make a great Bollywood movie. I know that the actors and actresses do not usually do their own singing, but they must do their own dancing - and what dancers. Unlike in the United States I guess you have to be a great actor and a great dancer to make it in India as a star." 
" A disgrace!","The film is like all other Bollywood films. A love triangle that ends in a happy marriage. But that's not what I am going to talk about. It's going to be about the role Satish Shah plays in the movie.If the director wants to show a Sikh family in the movie, fine. I understand that showing other religions, like Hindus, in other parts of India, like Gujju-land, may not be as presentable as a Sikh family in Punjab, but showing Sikh family practicing Hindu worship is not! Sikhs do not worship idols. Sikhs only believe in one God, equality of man kind and dignity for all. This is what their they mean when they wear a turban and beard. This movie disgraces this dignity of Sikhs! This movie is yet another example of the media attack on Sikhi. This portrayal of a Sikh family was wrong and should be apologized for." 
" Worst Film Ever","Worst Film And OverActing That's Way Film Is Big Flop At Box Office." 
" too run of the mill! in one word, BORING!!!","i just dont know when india will get sick and tired of such teeny bopper, chewing gum romances. its just astonishing that weve been churning out so many such movies since eons. also, the look of the film is also the same ole one. manish malhotra at work. manish, we want something fresh now. enough of the old stuff." 
" Avoid at all cost..........listen to the music though.","I am a big fan of Hrithik Roshan, and I think he is the best actor ever. I love all of his films except for this one and Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon. Which both are very similar. Both films are bad. But lets review Mujhe Se Dosti Karoge. I loved the music of mujhse Dosti Karoge. All songs are very melodious and fit well with each other. my favorite being Andehki Anjaani Si. The story, was nothing new, in fact it was very clichéd. The writer attempted a new style, but fell flat. The performances, the characterization was a huge drawback. Kareena's role was completely wasted. Her acting also was okay. Rani was good, but not great. Hrithik is a good actor, and tried his best, but the because of the disaster screenplay, and poor direction, Hrithik could not bring out his true potential. But he was still good. The length is also very long, I must say I watched this film twice and both times, I almost died from boredom. This film was was a flop at the box office. I see a lot of people praising this film. And I see nobody praising good films of Hrithik's like Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne lage and Na tum jano na hum, which were released the same year as Mujhse Dosti Karoge but also flopped. Those films were amazing, and Mujhse Dosti karoge is trash compared to those films. Take my advice, as a hrithik fan watch his every film, except for this one. listen to the songs though." 
" same old same old","MUJHSE DOSTI KAROGE -And once again after a decent gap of a couple of months we are taken back into the magical world of yash chopra movies.....the alps, the women in chiffon, the wonderful bonds of family and friendship and the same story repeated over and over again...Mujhse Dosti Karoge tries to be different.....honestly it does. It focusses on the friendship and subsequent love triangle of three childhood pals.....Raj, Tina and Pooja. As one of them pithily puts it......pyar dosti hai....oh wait sorry that was dil to pagal hai. Moving on....so mdk has this cool triangle between the scantily clad - nisha, the chopra version of the bharatiya nari - pooja and the gap clad - rahul.....oops that was also dil to pagal hai but you get the drift. Since the plot is redundant let's talk exciting stuff like this wonderful pseudo antakshari routine between sridevi, anil kapoor and anupam kher......my bad that was lamhe. Okay song picturisations then.....shot beautifully atop snow-clad mountains ( like every yash chopra movie since 1988), around the red telephone boxes and escalators of london ( see ddlj and k3g for more details) and an exciting on stage number (see kkhh for a slight but better variation on the same). Since nothing else is particularly new.....let's talk climax which features this awesome concept of the big man on top......yes God himself dropping in to sort matters out.....and there's this cute family dog....no no that's hahk....ok well mdk climax is hahk without the dog. Well atleast kunal kohli moved on to steal ideas from another banner instead of sticking with yash raj traditions.MDK is not a bad movie but it's a movie we've all seen over and over again in some form or the other. The fact that it liberally borrows ideas from other famous yash raj produced movies does not help since all of the other movies are close to classics with characters, songs and sequences that still resonate with movie-goers. Even the English original, The Truth about Cats and Dogs which itself is inspired from Cyrano de Bergerac was no Oscar contender....but it was a well made romantic comedy exuding warmth and goodness which is something one cannot say for MDK.The story is nothing to write home about, neither are the songs, the direction, the cinematography or even the acting. Kareena plays a watered down version of Poo, Rani plays a longer version of the saintly but soon dead Tina and Hrithik, well he does what he's being paid pots of money to do - exude charisma, shake a shapely leg or two and twinkle at the ladies. The biggest pity is these are all actors who are capable of much more, yet they settle for poor copies of roles they themselves have played before. And that's perhaps is the final word on MDK itself. It's a poor copy of movies made before by the same production house and that's a huge pity because the banner itself is capable of so much more.So do you watch it.......i wouldn't reccomend it.....go rent ddlj, kkhh, hahk even qsqt and mpk and see what romance is truly about.....why settle for a cheap copy when the original is just a movie rental away"
