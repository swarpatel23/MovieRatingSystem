" Nothing Krazzy about it..!!","A movie from Rakesh Roshan expected lot more than this script and dialogues. Juhi Chawla and Arsad Warsi's acting are wasted in this movie. It is an entertainer but doesn't have excellent humour. Some parts are elongated unnecessarily. Music is not that appealing. The plot of four mental people running around the city to save their doctor who is kidnapped doesn't enthral you.It could have been made more interesting. Sharukh's item song is good but Hrithik steals the screen with his stunning dance. Don't watch this movie if you like sense in movies..!!!!" 
" Not Crazy, Not Funny But Definitely Bad Enough To Avoid","Jaideep Sen's crappy 'Krazzy 4' is a headache, a very bad one. One may wonder how a movie that stars Arshad Warsi, Irfan Khan, Juhi Chawla and Rajpal Yadav can be so bad. Then again, can anyone expect anything good from Roshan's factory? Starting with the cast that got me interested to see this movie, none of them impress. Irfan Khan acts as if he's uninterested (why should he be otherwise?), Arshad Warsi terribly overacts, Rajpal Yadav is annoying, Zakir Hussain is the caricature bad cop, Diya Mirza is the whiny angry news-anchor girlfriend, Rajat Kapoor is miscast and Juhi Chawla barely has footage. There's hardly much comedy and the few jokes and 'skits' were not funny but only worsened the headache. Oh and in the end there's even a message: 4 crazy people are better than the sane people of the Indian population (cringe). The songs are truly abysmal, especially the Hinglish ones. Thankfully Hritik's baboon break-dance was in the end, so I didn't have to sit through that but Rakhi Sawant's item song is one of the sleaziest item songs in Bollywood. She's wearing a skirt so low that in one shot you can see her {censored} (ever heard of waxing?). This pretty much borders on pornography. I'm surprised this song goes unnoticed when people are quick to point fingers at Urmila for playing a prostitute in the item song of 'ki Aag'. Now what about the director Jaideep Sen? Well, did this film actually have a director? It looked like very bad improvisation by uninterested actors who were following a horrendously clich√©d script. Don't be mislead by the cast. Avoid this one at all costs." 
" Was it supposed to be funny??","Well I am not sure what the director had in mind while making this, but at least I got crazy after watching this movie, and I needed a sari-don. Though Irrfan and Rajpal are quite good in the movie, the weakest link is the storyline which has nothing to offer. And what a waste of talent of Juhi Chawla and Suresh Menon.The movie promised to be good initially but it turned out to be pathetic, thanks to poor screenplay, non humorous dialogs and average direction.The only saving grace in the movie were the few songs it had- especially Sharukh's item no. and Hrithik in the end. Go watch it at your own risk." 
" Nothing Krazy and Impressive","A movie from the house of Rakesh Roshan certainly raises expectations. And the publicity just before the release did add to the excitement. But all pump and show is nothing and the film disappoints in all departments.First of all the movie is completely predictable from the very first scene and it simply goes on with sequences which are just repetition of stuff seen many times before. In a nutshell the story is about some friends witnessing a crime and then the villains keep following them in the rest of the movie. Only this time the novelty is that the four friends are all mental patients who find an opportunity to roam out of their hospital.All the talented artists including Irfan Khan, Rajpal Yadav, Arshad Warsi and Juhi Chawla are just wasted and no one gets any scenes to talk about. Rajpal Yadav is the one who is better among the four patients as the freedom fighter. Arshad Warsi, strangely is not doing any comedy but shows that he can be an angry young man too. Irfan Khan can be seen trying to do the hard work as a mental doctor. Suresh Menon has no dialogues and speaks through his facial expressions. But as the script has nothing for them in store so they all seem to be helpless. The movie is inspired from a 1989 movie "THE DREAM TEAM" but it's not at all an impressive copy.The greatest drawback is that it's not a comedy, though it was publicised as a hilarious comedy flick. You keep waiting for comedy scenes to come but they are never there. All the songs come as an interruption and are also not enjoyable at all. The biggest let down is the "Ek Rupaiya" song after the interval, which makes you think, why the director chose this song to be there in final print. Only the last scene with some good dialogues is a kind of silver lining in the dark clouds.The biggest asset of the movie "Shahrukh Khan's Item Number" is well shot but it alone cannot save the film from sinking. Neither can the dance numbers by Hrithik Roshan and Rakhi Sawant. Rajesh Roshan / Ram Sampat music has nothing to talk about except the item numbers. The pace picks up just before the movie ends and the director tries to imitate a Priyadarshan kind of hilarious climax sequence which falls flat.After you finish the screening you just wonder why Rakesh Roshan backed up this project. In my opinion the talented father and son (Rakesh & Hrithik) knew that they have a weak final product so that is the reason they added 2 item numbers and also had a last moment publicity gimmick of plagiarism.A Big Let Down with a huge difference between the expectations and the final outcome. It is neither a good comedy nor a good thriller." 
" It's a tragedy disguised as a comedy","Krazzy 4 is one of those comedies that's not very funny in the first place. Irrfan Khan, Arshad Warsi, Rajpal Yadav and Suresh Menon play four mentally challenged patients who're taken to watch an India vs England cricket match because their psychiatrist Juhi Chawla thinks it might teach them a few things about team spirit. When Dr Juhi is mysteriously kidnapped however, our four protagonists are left to their own devices, roaming the streets unsupervised, with both cops and gangsters in hot pursuit. Blatantly ripped off from the Michael Keaton-Christopher Lloyd starrer The Dream Team, I'm willing to agree the plot of Krazzy 4 does inspire maybe three or four genuine laughs, but that's it, really that's just it. For the most part, the script is flat and unfunny, relying almost entirely on the four leads to save the day. That, unfortunately, is an impossible task even for talented actors such as these who pull faces, deliver clever one-liners, and try every trick in the book, but can't sadly rise above this severely flawed script. Usually even the worst films have at least some redeeming qualities, but where Krazzy 4 is concerned, it's difficult to understand exactly why this film was made. Didn't anyone concerned with the film notice that the script is incoherent? Didn't anyone realize that the humour is juvenile and slapstick and it's the kind of humour you've seen so many times before? Didn't anyone think of re-shooting all the dull bits so at least some part of the film might actually be watchable? The answer to all those questions is obviously no. Krazzy 4, if you ask me, is a fitting title for this film except that I'd like to change the number four to the number 12 or 13, or whatever number of crazy people are responsible for bringing this film to the screen. It's a shame that talented actors like Juhi Chawla, Irrfan Khan and Rajpal Yadav have been wasted in a thankless film like this which they will look back at years later and think of as a bad dream. If there's anything at all besides the end credits that brings a smile to your face while watching Krazzy 4, I'd have to say it's the two item songs in the film -- one each by Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan. And to be honest, even the one with Rakhi Sawant isn't too bad. But these are alas, small pleasures in an otherwise miserable movie-going experience. A word here for Ashwani Dhir, the film's dialogue writer who holds the unique distinction of delivering a triple whammy of disasters like 1 2 3, U, Me Aur Hum and Krazzy 4 . Dhir's lines are amateurish and laboured and they're largely responsible for why none of these films worked for me. But blame has to be shared by the film's director Jaideep Sen whose treatment here is indifferent, showing neither artistic flair nor solid grip over screenplay. Because it's a khichdi of cheap humour, unimpressive acting, and a directionless plot. It's a tragedy disguised as a comedy that I wouldn't even wish upon an enemy." 
" Some fun, some emotions. But not in a proper way...",""Everyone thinks they are crazy but they're not." It is the main theme the movie is trying to show. 4 mental patients and watching their effort to rescue their kidnapped doctor is somewhat interesting but I don't see any way to say that this movie is a good one. This movie was made by crazy people for the crazy people. I don't blame actors for this, because they have done the good job. Story was fine. But, I didn't really like the dialogs at the ending scene of the movie. That was totally no fun, useless. I enjoyed while watching the movie, but not much when I left. The whole movie wasn't as good as the opening scene. But, the movie is not that bad for one time viewing." 
" Pointless and Not Funny","I am confused after seeing Krazzy 4. What was it intended to be - a comedy film, a film with a moral, or what? The film was promising with the cast it had. Arshad Warsi, Irfan Khan, Rajpal Yadav and Suresh Menon - any one of them on their day can give you stomach aches laughing. But all of them are equally wasted. I wonder why is Diya Mirza doing such itsy-bitsy roles these days. Anyway, this role of hers is not going to do her any good. Let me also mention this - I feel sad and enraged when films 'exploit' the national anthem. It is cheap gimmickry. This happens in Krazzy 4 too. I wonder what the film-makers wanted to achieve with that.It is not a comedy film, for sure. I don't know what it is." 
" Not too bad","Storyline is poor, but I enjoyed the movie as it has some funny scenes and dialogues and the acting was good. Most of the Indian reviewers will surprise you as they think: movies like Karan Arjun is flamboyant, movies like Main hoon na are super hits. To me, these 2 movies are boring (boring means: typical formula of bollywood) with boring acting of Shahrukh Khan. But these are blockbusters, so don't really believe these comments. Go and watch it. You will enjoy and forget, it's not a memorable movie but it will not bore you unlike other silly action, romantic, exaggerated sensitive movies ( like Karan Johar :) ) and some other Directors. To me, this movie is average, but it's much better than other super hit movies , I will give it 5. Hritik Roshan special appearance is good, he did the dance sequence very well. Rest is good, it should not be that bad for an Indian audience as they are habituated to watch much worse movies, so I hope this movie is okay. Story is written over here, read and decide. :)" 
" Crap","Rakesh Roshan seems to got the success mantra and makes a comedy afterall so many comedies have workedHe copied A DREAM TEAM and indianised it in such a way it makes the worst comedies look greatThe film has an okay story but the handling of the comic scenes slowly get so bizarre and boring they make you cringe The problem lies in the way the director has handled the scenes Scenes like Irrfan's index finger showing are crude and also the national anthem scene is so bizarre Even the entire Sunil Pal act and the last speech which ruins everything even more Directorally (Jaideep Sen) the film is a dabaa Music is decent, the forced item songs are well shotActing wiseArshad Warsi- he acts the angry character very well which reminds u of his headache provoking comic act in DHAMAAL but here is good Irrfan Khan- After Sunday again he tries slapstick comedy and he isn't utilised fully and is just okayRajpal Yadav- he does lend credence to his role but his comedy isn't at his usual bestSuresh Menon- does a good jobJuhi Chawla- wastedZakir Hussain- Another villain role and the same actRajat Kapur- lostDia Mirza- getting better with every film" 
" In the world of Krazzy people.","Bollywood, it seems, is on a flop run after Jodhaa Akbar. Observe, One Two Three and Race (Yes, it was crap). I expected a slapstick comedy after looking at the promos of Krazzy 4, choosing this over the weeks other release, U Me aur Hum.The story is simple enough. Four 'mad' guys, are taken out on a field trip by their doctor. Doctor gets kidnapped, havoc ensues, or should I say, krazziness. Fullstop. Simple enough. Doesn't torture you like the 'come-sit-down-and-let-me-tell-you-how-I-planned-your-murder' way of Race.The mad people under question.. Krazzy a. Arshad playing Raja, a man suffering from sudden bouts of rage. Anger disorder. Krazzy b. Irrfan playing Dr. Mukherjee, suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder. He's a cleanliness freak who'll try to get dirt of the backside of a nurse's uniform. Krazzy c. Rajpal playing Gangadhar. He thinks he still lives in the Gandhian era. Vande Mataram. Krazzy d. Suresh playing Dabboo. Hasn't talked since he was four years old.Their doctor played to utter sweetness by Juhi Chawla. Don't think I'm being sarcastic. The places where Krazzy 4 succeed are its utter sweet moments. Apart from being extremely tenderly acted by everyone, it also isn't very long. Hardly an hour and fifty minutes. All four leads play their roles very efficiently. Rajpal being the one who offers the most laughs. Just wait till his ending speech. Irrfan Khan, the great actor that he is, gets a small role, easy for him to play. He plays this even more delicately. Suresh Menon, for a guy who hardly talks, is fun to watch. His expressions will get you laughing. Rajpal Yadav had me in splits every time he spoke. His way of delivery is such. Watch out for the scenes with 'Aazadi - 50% off' and the one with Gandhiji and Nehru. The backing actors, Rajat Kapoor, Dia Mirza, and the 'bad guys', serve their purpose well. The guy playing Dia's father deserves special mention. You've seen him before.The songs are merely there. No romantic hus-phus etc etc. Shah Rukh Khan has never looked better. Trust me. Stay back till the end to watch Hrithik too. The two music videos are sheer eye candy proving to us who the real pin-up boys of Bollywood really are. High point of the movie is where a little girl sings Jana Gana Mana. If the people in the hall stand up to attention to it, like they did in the show I went to, you'll feel good. Vande Mataram. I shall not go far enough to say Rakhi Sawant 'does not' look good in the music video, but I would have preferred Mallika Sherawat in it. The song is Beedi'ish, but not nearly good enough. And we finally did it people. They've written a song about One Rupee. An amazing one at that too. They've added everything, from Kajra re to Dum to Opera - style. Hilarious.Krazzy 4 tries the Munnabhai-way of entertainment, preaching about the ways of society and how people who are 'different' have no place in it. It misses the Munnabhai mark by a long shot. But it really doesn't matter. It's a sweet short movie. You could say it was made with a lot of care, and they promised us a sequel at the end. So, to be continued..7/10 for acting. 6/10 for the story. 6/10 for music. 6/10 for directing. 10/10 for the two pin-up boys. P.S.: Get Mallika to do an item number in the sequel." 
" An Entertaining One","A movie from Raakesh Roshan definitely means a lot of expectations but unfortunately this doesn't live quite up to it and more so after hearing about the movie almost being stopped from release due to copyrights on a certain song and then being told that "King Khan" was upset with the Roshans and Hrithik coming out to deny it - basically all the hype.Four men who are considered to be mentally unstable are on their way to watch a cricket match with their doctor, when suddenly she is kidnapped and the men try to locate her.The movie, starring Juhi Chawla, Arshad Wasi, Diya Mirza, Irfan Khan, Rajpal Yadav, Suresh Menon and Rajat Kapoor, is a good concept and is also entertaining. But one can tell exactly what is going to happen in the next scene and it was obvious who the kidnapper was. But never the less, it is still entertaining. The item songs by Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan are worth watching and waiting for (if you are ardent fans of theirs). But unfortunately, I can't say that for Rakhi Sawant's item song - not so catchy.Incidentally, the movie was on the point of being stopped from release because of a particular issue as mentioned before and Raakesh Roshan had to pay the original artist / composer of the song, Ram Sampat 20 million Rupees.Conclusion: Its an entertaining movie but not something that one can feel that one must watch." 
" Best characters of a Hindi comedy!!!","OK... I am so shocked the rating on Krazzy 4 is so low!! The acting was so great to these excellent characters. Rajpal Yadav plays a poor crazy man thinking Ghandi and freedom fighters are still around, Irrfan Khan as a was-doctor now in a mental patient trying to pick up everyone's trash... Arshad Warsi has an explosive temper and poor Suresh Menon is a mute and says nothing pretty much... 4 mental patients going to see a cricket game under the guise this should help them learn to work as a team who get mixed up in a crazy kidnapping... now are loose in the city trying to find their doctor...this movie had the most crazy shenanigans and made me laugh so hard. The characters mad this film. They were excellent. I especially loved Irrfan Khan as an quiet introverted neat freak. This movie was great Oh yeah and one of the last films Shah Rukh is in where he doesn't look too old... (his song must be the shortest in the film BTW)!!! Hrithik dancing on the end credits was great too! Obviously it won't go down in cinematic history but it is a great time pass and not some sleazy comedy!! Just good fun film"
