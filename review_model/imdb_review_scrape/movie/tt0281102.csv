" This is what a great inspiration is...copycat directors could learn from this the difference between a ripoff and inspiration","Ram Gopal Verma does a superb job of creating one of the finest inspired movies. He's mentioned in numerous interviews about the source being one of his favorite films. Mind you, I said inspiration, NOT ripoff. Copycat directors could learn from this example what the difference is between an inspiration and a ripoff. Unfortunately, Verma has been more recently pulled into the ripoff wagon too (e.g. Sarkar).Back to 'Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya', Rajat Mukherjee gives a fine directorial debut. The story can be seen as a character study of three people but that does not give the plot less importance. The characters are brilliantly defined and the plot is coherent and keeps you engaged.Chandan Arora's editing is quite impressive. Although maybe the first song could have been left out. Even though the main plot in the screenplay is quite intense, the humour element provides some comic relief (thanks to Rajpal Yadav).Fardeen Khan, though does not exactly give a great performance, one can see that the actor is trying and he deserves credit for that. Sonali Kulkarni is bubbly, elegant and adorable. She does her part very well. But, 'Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya' belongs to Urmila Matondkar. This is one of the finest performances of a complex character and Urmila is flawless as an obsessive borderliner. She seems to play the part naturally. She balances her non-verbal expressions (expressive eyes, awkward gait, tone of voice etc) and her dialogue delivery is superb. It really makes one appreciate the art of acting. Suresh Oberoi is very good as the father.Writer Rajat Mukherjee deserves credit for creating such human characters. We see that Jai is a nice person but he does have the attitude of constantly flirting with colleagues, Geeta is the loving wife but she doubts Jai's fidelity and Ria who even though isn't mentally stable, has a light side and she was quite happy when she was modelling for Jai but her thoughts were quite black and white (typical thinking of a borderliner) and she was very stubborn.Music is impressive. Though the first song is good and introduces Fardeen's character, it could be avoided to shorten the film but it's not necessarily a bad addition. Urmila again dances mesmerizingly in Kambakt Ishq. Alisha's Roundey is flawlessly sung and dictate the thoughts of Ria very well.All in all, this is one of the finest drama-thrillers and surely worth a watch because of the fine screenplay, excellent performances, impressive direction, good music and it's worth the time." 
" New Theme in Indian Movie","I would rate this film not exactly as "Time Pass", but above that, watchable, if you want to see something new or "Hat Ke", rather then hurting yourself will all the run-of-mill stories.The first half of movie drags while the second half has more pace that it should have been. Also, there was no reason to introduce comic relief in form of the non-sense "Chhota Vakeel" stuff. It is ridiculous that Indian Directors still cannot come out of notion that there "Should Be" a comedy in movie, whether it seems appropriate or not.One can feel that Urmila is doing the sequel to her role in "Kaun". However, character of "Jai" is portrayed in a very good manner, with all the weaknesses and down-to-earth nature, rather then depicting him as a typical Hindi movie "Hero". Other characters give in their fair share.On an whole, a nice movie, if you want to see something different. I should appreciate Ram Gopal Verma and Rajat Mukherjee for coming out with some different stuff. Next, time they should concentrate on building more solid story line. Perhaps, they could have taken clue from Yash Chopras "Darr" (Which ironically fails in second half)" 
" love stories do not always have a happy ending!","Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya (PTKK) was high on my list of movies to watch this year. Why? Firstly, debutante director Rajat Kumar is another protégé from the Ram Gopal Verma stable - Verma being India's answer to Martin Scorsese, and secondly I was conversant with the fact that Urmila was given a similar role to her convincing portrayal of the psychotic girl-home-alone in Verma's 1999 thriller  - Kaun. In this latest release we see Urmila cast opposite the convalescing Fardeen Khan again after last year's successful Jungle.  The young Khan is evidently improving and it seems as though he has managed to overcome his humiliation and failure after his debut film - Prem Aggan (1998) - which was ineptly directed by his father Feroz Khan. In PTKK, Verma casts Fardeen Khan as the young Jai - a striving fashion photographer who lives a happily married life with his loving wife Geeta (Sonali Kulkarni). Jai is constantly on the look out for subjects he finds 'interesting and beautiful' and on one picturesque evening he comes across Ria (Urmila) meditating on the edge of a cliff (do not ask why!). Through his persistence, he persuades Ria to participate in a photo-shoot for a magazine he works for.  Ria is unaware of the fact that Jai is married and believes that he is interested in her. The more they start meeting on a regular basis, Ria's infatuation with Jai escalates. Ria is the sole child of a wealthy businessman (Suresh Oberoi) who starts to show his concern over Ria's split personality and daredevil antics.As months pass by and the more sociable Jai and Ria become, Ria's love for Jai grows to unprecedented heights and she shows the first signs of her true volatile nature. However, on one occasion Ria is introduced to Geeta - Jai's wife. Suddenly, Ria becomes an embittered and distressed woman refusing to accept the fact that Jai has no feelings for her and begins to stalk him and his wife at home and at work. Rajat Mukherjee has directed a movie that leaves a lasting impression on the viewer but I feel as though the film is not as strong as it could have been. The editing was mundane and the story itself should have been defined more convincingly. More importantly, there were several holes in the script that will ultimately determine the outcome of the film at the box-office. The fact that throughout the entire movie Jai never gives the impression to Ria or mentions the fact that he is a married man is very hard to believe. The whole movie runs on that basis alone and it makes you think why on earth Jai did not tell Ria of his marriage... a notorious flirt? The strongest point about the film is how Verma has very well thought out the two most important characters in the film - Jai and Ria.Acting by Urmila as Ria is truly remarkable. The 'Rangeela' girl has always been an underrated actress but by looking at her previous films, one cannot help but be impressed. We all saw her as the 10-year-old Pinky in Shekhar Kapoor's 1983 classic Masoom where she was billed as a star for the future. However, it wasn't until 1995 when Ram Gopal Verma gave her the role of a life time with the first of his big hits - Rangeela. Rangeela became an instant hit with the masses and Urmila had finally arrived on the Bollywood scene. What followed next was a spate of box-office hits with Verma including Satya, Mast, Kaun, and Jungle. Though she is yet to be nominated for a Film Fare Award - one has the feeling it is only a matter of time until she is honoured for her efforts. Maybe next year for PTKK! Fardeen Khan gives another plausible performance as Jai. The young Khan is creating a useful niche for himself by working with Ram Gopal Verma. The more I see him in Verma's movies, the more his acting impresses me. Fardeen is one of the few actors in the industry who has a communicative face. His face clearly expresses how he feels and he is suited to Verma's style of filmmaking where characterisation is the major factor.Music by Sandeep Chowta is spot-on. The background musical score complements the movie flawlessly  - reminiscent to the background score in Verma's starkly realistic Satya in 1998. Urmila's acting is one of many reasons to watch this film. Though it is not as good as I was expecting it to be, PTKK is worthy of praise due to the fact that a young director who had previously never sat behind a camera helms the project. Nevertheless, Verma's magic is clearly evident throughout and I am certain PTKK will be one of the better-quality movies to come out of Bollywood this year." 
" It's DIFFERENT .. !!","Pyar Tune Kya Kiya, one of the most eagerly awaited releases of 2001, begs to differ from the regular Bollywood run-of-the mill potboiler.Instead of whipping up a candy-floss romance between 2 NRI adolescents, the debutante director tells the tale of a head-strong rich bitch who loses it all on discovering that her objet d'amour is a happily married man ! The psychotic miss then makes life HELL for the love birds until the saga climaxes in to a very gripping finalé !Sounds good ? Errr ... well ! Not really. The tale incorporates an extremely avoidable series of comic (??) scenes in the first half which leaves the audience pondering over its relevance to the film. The director miserably fails in his attempt of providing comic relief by way of the "CHOTA VAKEEL" scenes which, in fact, drive you up the wall !On the PLUS side, we have a SUPER music score by Sandeep Chowtha. The songs Kambakht Ishq and the title track, though unnecessary to the plot, are very hummable and catchy 'n' extremely well shot. Amongst the performances, Urmila is top-notch as the head-strong femme fatale. Apart from looking WHITE-HOT in the work-out and modeling scenes, she adds several dimensions to her challenging role. The surprise package is however Sonali Kulkarni who charms her way into your heart with her tinkering laughter and her dainty ways after playing Hrithik Roshan's mother in Mission Kashmir. Fardeen, though not particularly gifted as an actor, is easy on the eyes and has a friendly 'n' flirtatious screen presence.All in all, it's a flick worth a watch provided you are prepared to take a nap while the ridiculous 'Chhota Vakeel' scenes play on !!" 
" Pyar Tune Kya Kiya","The Bollywood masala rip-off of the famed Clint Eastwood film 'Play Misty For Me'.Subtle variations are made to suit the co-called Bollywood code of morals and virtues.Here trying to present a maniac as a martyr of love!Fardeen is plausible and full of youth.Urmilla is better though her exposure is needless.The comedy is useless.THe direction is passing.I fee the writer should have followed the Eastwood classic to the explosive end to give the story a more meaningful climax.This movie might have given a realistic view of the fact that despite being so liberated the essential Indian woman is still rooted to her ages old tradition of honour and respect.It always pop up in her conscience by hook or by crook.The bollywood masala recipe of sex,dance and nudity will one day reduce the film industry to pornography." 
" 9.5/10... one of the finest","One of the finest movies ever. How come the rating is 5.7? Urmila is at her best. The only weak link is Fardeen Khan." 
" Fury of a woman scorned !","No other actress would have carried off this role, which is a psychiatric character, turning into a psychopathic personality, not bothered for the consequences of her actions, prepared to even kill, for revenge ! That's Urmila Matondkar, one of the most photogenic, sexy, emotive, shapely, and a very talented, yet sadly neglected, and underrated actresses, of Indian cinema.This is her movie, though among the female cast, Sonali Kulkarni, another acclaimed one, in a supporting role of a doting, yet confused housewife, unwittingly involved in the drama, and becoming the target of the wrath of Ria, the model, brought into lime light, by her husband only, played by Fardeen Khan. Some how, the major flaw in the plot line of this movie is, the hero conveniently not disclosing his marital status to the heroine, till such time, as she is so involved, and has become extremely possessive of him. The way he behaves with her, also fuels her love for him, where as, he is apparently acting as a true professional, for whom, it's her beauty for the posters in which she has to look marvelous, so he has to keep her in good spirits, that's all ! This is , by far, a good performance of Urmila, in her credits of enacting psychologically disturbed characters, like Ek Hasina, Bhoot, etc., which had different shades of course, like the revenge, possession by a spirit . She carries the role in such a way, the audience really watches her in awe, while she enters into it so realistically, you almost feel, is she mad in her real life ?It must be quite taxing on her, to show all those intriguing expressions of turmoil, mental agony, changing moods ! She conveys the avenging woman , out to murder , attacking and frightening, though she is so slim and demure otherwise, as well as the pathos of a metal patient, lost in her own world now, yet some where remembering her last passion, is very remarkable. she is definitely a step ahead of even Madhuri, or Aishwarya, who might have tried similar roles. she could be compared to kaajol for her talents. and has an edge over them ,for her flawless beauty, dancing skills, and well-toned body.Some one in his user comments has called this a copy of the Fatal Attraction, but i don't agree with it totally. the director, and the screen play writer, have given this film, a different treatment, focussing on the innocence of the hero, his feelings for heroine, which are not sex tilted, and his love for his wife. The theme song, Pyar tune kya kiya, is lifted from an English tune, but surprisingly sounds original, that's the art of plagiarizing, i suppose ? editing, filmography, music, especially, Urmila's photo sessions are good . the other supporting actors have also delivered. A must for the fans of Urmila !" 
" Another remake of english movie","Indian film industry has done it again. Rather than coming up with new ideas, they are copying the hollywood movies and making money. This film is the copy of "fatal attraction" english movie with some spicy scenes at the beginning. It was OK for the first time, but I would not see it again."
