" Very good movie indeed,worthy of watching","I know its gonna sound bloody insane,but for me(no critics,as an average human being like you) it was the best Hindi romantic movie i've ever seen.Nice chemistry between Shahrukh & Anushka(I'm their fan :P ),plaudits for Aditya chopra for this masterpiece,amazing music & Cinematography.Some questions will rise,how someone can't recognize her own husband without mustache,and some silly others.But the fact is i don't know how,but somehow this movie just touch your heart deeply,i mean u have to..u have to smile and cry in the meantime while watching this movie....for not only me,my friends and companions,almost 90% were having same feeling.credit goes to the whole team for this kind of creation.Thank you for your time and reading this review.hope,u would be kind enough to forget if i made any mistake.Stay blessed :)" 
" Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai- Yaara main Kya Karu!!!!!","With Aditya Chopra Directing this Sharukh Khan starrer I obviously had huge expectations from this movie the first time its promo was aired...The Music was marvelous. Great work by Salim-Sulaiman that made me more eager to watch the film. I remember that while I was lining up for the tickets, a friend of mine who was coming out after watching the movie said that it was absolutely pathetic. According to him, the entire movie was stupid because it was about a wife not recognizing his husband without a mustache & having a flick with him thinking it was some one else.....his review did make sense & i was a bit demoralized coz I had just purchased the tickets. But when I did watch the movie, I realized ho beautiful it actually was...The movie was not about a stupid wife not recognizing his husband without a mustache. In fact, though they were husband & wife the reason she could never figure out the difference between Raj & Suri was that she was never that close to Suri in the first place.The message that the movie tries to convey that "If one has to love me then it's got to be the real me & not the person that I can pretend to be"Sharukh's best work after Chak De India!!!!God Bless the Makers of this Film!!!!!" 
" So what if she didn't recognise him?","I didn't love this movie, but I'm frustrated at how most of the negative reviews are focused on the wife not recognising her husband. Have none of you seen Superman? In that, Lois Lane doesn't recognise that Clark Kent is Superman, and yet I doubt any of you would complain there. It is a trivial plot element that can be overlooked - and in the film's defence, they did try and justify it by making romance a bit magical (though probably didn't need to go that far).The film was sweet, colourful, and fun to watch. The music was great and the acting was decent. Having said that, I think there were some fundamental flaws in the films and tricks they missed:1. Why should the girl love Suri when he offers her none of the love and fun that Raj does? I don't understand why she is supposed to settle for the 'real' Suri when he is so boring. If Taani is supposed to compromise for her husband, should he not also become a bit more like Raj and meet her half way? It would have been great if he had started dressing a bit more fashionably for her even in his 'Suri' self. 2. We are told that Taani is a loyal and decent wife. Yet it is completely out of character for her to think about running away with another man. I was a bit disappointed that she didn't even tell Raj she was married and spent so much time with him outside home.3. A perfect twist to the film would be for Taani to have known all along - it would have been a nice way of showing that Taani did recognise his heart from the start but she also wanted to see how far Suri could go. But without this twist, the story was very predictable.These things make the film very frustrating for me. But at the same time, I don't want to fault it too much as I think it is still on the right path - I'm fed up of the show-offy 'Don's of Bollywood today. Romance is still where it's at." 
" Not Typical, but treat to watch","First of all i would like to comment on the dare step taken by the A. Chopra to make a movie on such a middle class topic.It's an excellent movie with very different approach. I am amazed after reading different reviews. Come on folks, don't expect King khan all the time doing the Millionaire roles.Excellent direction, outstanding performances with average music. Script of the movie might be a much tighter. I am not a SRK fan by any mean, but after this movie, i started thinking by doing this.In the end, very good family drama movie and treat to watch. Come on folks stop dreaming Glamour all the time. These low budgets and middle class story movies are the real time facts of our lives." 
" Aditya Ne Banadi Wonderful film","The movie was already the most hotly anticipated film of the year when it was announced in March because it is finally the third directorial outing of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Mohabbatein director Aditya Chopra. Aditya's films always turn out to be good and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is his next movie 8 years after Mohabbatein. The story is about an 'odd' couple played by Shahrukh Khan and Anushka Sharma who find true love in the backdrop of a dance competition called "Dancing Jodi". Surinder Sahni (Shahrukh Khan), a man working for Punjab Power, who falls in love with Taani (Anushka Sharma) the flamboyant, fun-loving, vivacious girl for whom the whole world is her canvas and she paints her own life with the colours of rainbow all until unforeseen circumstances changes it all and brings them together. They get married and lead a not-so happy life due to huge age difference between Surinder and Taani. Taani, meanwhile, wants to participate in a reality dance show called "Dancing Jodi," which is the main backdrop of the movie. The dance contest showcases couples of all races, colours, backgrounds and sexual preferences. Taani wants to take part for the show, but she is not able to due to her husband's lack of fashion statement. Later on when Surinder finds out about his wife's wish to participate in the reality dance show, he undergoes a major change. Taani keeps falling in love with her changed husband.Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is such a beautiful film that touches your heart that makes you cry and laugh in some points like Shahrukh against a sumo wrestler. Some of my friends thought that it looked rubbish because in the promos Shahrukh Khan had a moustache, and comb over and was wearing bad cloths but is truly the best the best Bollywood movie of the year after a long list of turkeys. It is also the first Shahrukh film of the year and before this he made special appearances in Krazzy 4 and Bhootnath. The music is brilliant although they can't match with the classic soundtracks of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Mohabbatein but there were about 5 songs and every single song was good and I don't know what the best songs are. It is a must see unless you do not like Shahrukh or have a heart of stone because there is no way you are going to like it." 
" Made in heaven","A couple who have got nothing in common. A couple who were never destined to be married and got married. The love that blossoms in their life. This is a simple movie about a couple whose marriage starts as a compromise to grow as a love story.Surinder Sahni works for Punjan Powers with a very simpleton look. He goes to attend the wedding of his college professor's daughter with whom he fall in love himself at the first sight. The scene changes when the news reached about the accident of the groom and his entire family. The professor makes Surinder marry to Tani as he relied completely on him. Surinder promises to take care of Tani.Tani always dreamnt of a fairytale life and love. She was never happy with Surinder and merely stretching her life with him. Then comes a dance show called Dancing Jodi which changes their life forever. Tani wants to take part in the show but she doesn't want to do so with Surinder. Surinder understands this and goes for a makeover and in the new look tries to woo her. And then she lifts her from her feet and by the time the show is mid-day, Tani is in love with Raj, the makeover version of Surinder. But Tani is married to Surinder; how can she fall in love? She doesn't want to cheat on her husband, and she can't stay away from Raj too. What will happen when she will understand that both Surinder and Raj are the same person. One she doesn't love and the other she is madly in love with.Aditya Chopra returns to direction after DDLJ in 99. Though Mohabattein was good but it wasn't a box office success. The movie has got just 4 characters and all of them have delivered their best." 
" just go watch it!!!","The first thing that come to my mind after watching the movie is.........!NO WORDS!, simply mind blowing. A Fantastic movie which worth every pi of my money and every second of my time. SRK's performance and the odd look as Surinder Sahni is simply superb!. Surinder Sahni is a non active normal Indian guy who was forced to marry the beautiful Desi Taani(Anushka Sharma). The story is full of expressing Surinder's pure love towards Taani.Surinder changes himself completely to get the attention of his love Taani. The story runs with twist and turns, dance and music, comedy and drama and with a little action! by Taani.Finally an expected-unexpected climax steals the heart of every audience and make them to forget themselves in the emotion of love.Thats all about the movie. My suggestion is to simply just go and watch it. You will really appreciate the performance of King Khan and Anusuka." 
" Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is Extraordinary!!","Superb!! Is the first thing that comes into your mind when you are going to see this film!!! Perfect is the second exclamation that will follow! Everything about this film is perfect (Even Anushka Sharma, on whom I didn't have much expectation!).The story is about a regular guy Surinder Sahani who works for Punjab Power and leads a regular, monotonous life. But Rab (God) had different plans for him. His life undergoes a complete change when Tani (Anushka) comes into his life. This film is about Love in its purest form, and everything that expresses love, Dance, Music...Coming to the technical staff! Everything here were perfect too! Lyrics, Music, Direction, Camera, Cinematography! Acting of everyone was natural and proportionate.Lastly, A film For Everyone, Go and Watch this movie and then You'll see that I am not Overreacting here!!" 
" A movie made from Rab!","I went to see RNBDJ because of Shah Rukh Khan first of all, but did not know what to expect since I made a point not to read any reviews or synopsis of the film. I only knew that the audience seemed to give good review but critics were not friendly with their reviews. I must say they have become to jaded upon watching numerous films that they missed the beauty of this film. I love Aditya Chopra for directing such a brave and bold film that comes straight from his heart! SRK portrayed Surih and Raj with sheer perfection. I loved him as both characters; they both made me smile and also drove me to tears! Anuksha did a brilliant job as her debut character and I couldn't believe this was only her first film. She was marvelous and fresh as Taani. The songs are just beautiful and they will either make you get up and dance or lay down and just cry tears of happiness. The climax was mesmerizing and surprising, the comedy was wonderful and the message was very important that we need to love our "jodi" for who they are and not who we wish they are. We are all made from God so we have to remember to see God in everybody! What a brilliant and different film Yash Raj Films made; I love you guys for this gift!" 
" Rab ne is a lot of fun...don't miss this one","Rab ne is an absolutely entertaining film. Have no doubts about that...But before I go on to review the film, I would like to say a thing or two about the so called professional reviewers of our online media. Each genre and each storyline will have a different yardstick depending on what the film is setting out to achieve. Don't go looking for logic and 'intelligence' in a film when its primary motive is to make people laugh and have a good time.And I will host a grand party the day rediff ditches Mr.raja sen.That aside, Rab ne is a film which will make you feel good and happy and Shahrukh absolutely deserves credit for this. His performance as Mr.Surinder is an absolute delight to watch and the mannerisms will leave you in splits of laughter. And then, the performance as Raj is the icing on the cake.I wont say anything more about this as it will spoil the experience for you.Shahrukh Khan, take a bow.This is amongst your best performances to date.The new face of the film, Anushka deserves special mention for the way she acted and carried off the role of Taani. There is innocence,charm,a certain vulnerability and tenderness in the character but at the same time she can be quite a force to reckon with if provoked. And Anushka lived in the role. For a debutant, its amazing.Vinay pathak as usual was his excellent self as the best friend of Shahrukh and their moments on screen are truly rib tickling.'Haule Haule' song is very good and so is the background score. It adds weight to the film and to the comedy. All the other songs are pretty decent.The way the city of Amritsar was shown is also very nice and the rich production values of yashraj films is clearly visible in each and every frame.And finally, for the director. Welcome back Mr. Aditya. We missed you and we hope that you make movies a little more often than you do.Maybe, the ending could have been handled slightly better but then its not a major gripe. Some parts of the story may defy conventional logic like the way Shahrukh manages to juggle his different 'careers'. But as I said earlier,these kinds of films are not about logic or intelligence.They are about making you laugh and have a good time and in that Rab ne is eminently successful.All in all, Rab ne is a very feel good film that you can go out and watch with your whole family. 100% Paisa Vasool film" 
" Brilliant!!!","after seeing shah rukh khan in om shanti om i completely lost faith in him...the second half in which he tried to act cool was painful to watch...but his performance is this movie is simply mind blowing. Aditya chopra has done it again.its a very simple film with a simple plot but u leave the hall with a smile on your face. anoushka sharma gives an excellent performance way better than deepika.this movie reminds me of the old greats which yash raj studios used to make. please go watch this movie.simply fantastic.also watch out for vinay pathak who gives a funny performance as shahrukhs best friend bobby." 
" Very entertaining and interesting throughout","This is very different from DDLJ 1995 and Mohabbtaein. RNBDJ 2008 is very entertaining and different film. We have not seen such a good movie for a long time. This film is not about a dance competition but it is about a human being who can be so natural that do not need any artificial pomp and show to be an honest lover. Shah Rukh Khan has done his job brilliantly. He is such a solid actor and no one in Indian cinema can match his character playing and emotions portraying. He can even make a dumb movie like Om Shanti Om look good and be hit. Must watch this movie in theater, and you will definitely want to see it again." 
" Its a good movie","This storyline is nice, so is the idea. But there are some ignorable flaws in the direction like when Shahrukh brings his bride home and lifts the suitcase, one can easily tell that it is an empty one. But then again they have paid so much attention to details, like the usage of 'yellow' color in every possible way. The chemistry between the lead pair is good nothing over the top. Shahrukh's character is extremely sweet and lovable.My suggestions: 1. Watch this movie when you are feeling hopelessly romantic. 2. Don't watch it keeping DDLJ in mind, DDLJ is beyond comparison." 
" Beautiful Film.Excellent Work.","A true masterpiece.A truly different love story from the Aditya after a long time.SRK is truly the KING of Bollywood.No actor could have carried the role with such elegance as he did.I just loved every bit of it.Anuska as a new comer has done really very very well.Vinay Pathak is as usual very good.3 characters Srk, Anushka, Vinay carried the whole film so well.Marvelous! Performance are at par excellence.Refreshing film with refreshing sets,direction,music,choreography.Everything is so brilliantly done , no words for praising.Watch it ! Or you will repent. Haule Haule Very very well executed for the global audience.So bye.Opps....! Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte." 
" Very sweet movie..","This is a very cute movie, that brings tears to your eyes. Surinder Sahni (SRK) marries Taani (Anushka Sharma) because of a twist of fate. As he loves her and she doesn't love him, he decides to change his appearance and go to her dance classes as Raj, the flirty,funny, and cheery guy. He woos her , and she starts to like him. With great performances by Anushka,SRK,and Vinay Pathak, with great songs, cute duologue's,and sweet characters, this movie is SO worth it! I liked it because of the sweetness of Surinder, the bubbliness of Taani, the funniness of Vinay, the foot tapping Dance Pe Chance, the cute Haule Haule, the interesting Hum Hain Raahi Pyaar Ke,and the romantic Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai, these songs definitely deserve some space on your iPod, and in your heart." 
" I want my money and precious time back...","Grrrr......I took my friend who is a crazy SRK fan to watch this "Rab Ne..." thing thinking at least she might enjoy and I'll enjoy her company as I already had known how bad this movie is.But it turned out to be so pathetic that even my SRK crazy friend also couldn't bear it and decided to wait hopelessly post interval that something good might come. Eventually she quit just 15-20 minutes before the "climax" if thats what you can call it. We moved out of the theatre to do better things on a lazy Sunday evening but lost so much time already waiting for some "chamatkar"(miracle) from Rab(God) or "Rab Ne...". My friends condition was similar to that of Anoushka(Tanni) in a scene when she is watching some movie and runs out of the theatre away from SRK. I wonder if that was an ironic hint for the audience as well.The performance of Shahrukh(Surinder Sahni) is so predictable and irritating that it would make a brain tumor look merciful. Anoushka(Tanni) forgot to join acting classes before entering this venture and Aditya Chopra needs to revisit direction classes. Even the songs seemed too forced in certain situations and the chemistry between the lead pair is flat as it was supposed to be touching. In a love story there is supposed to be love and not compromise + "good luck" which it appears to be in this case.Also I heard a lot of praise about Vinay Pathak's(Sahnis friend) performance. Firstly, he doesn't fit the role of a guy who can produce a makeover by just shaving someones moustache. And then he seems to be competing with Shahrukh Khan in the over-acting business looking more like the audiences worst enemy than Surinder's best friend.Thanks Yash Raj for proving once more that you'll are up for producing only rehashed bull which we the audience are supposed to digest at any cost.Everyone please take a prescription from your doctor for severe headache and nausea if you plan on visiting this movie."
