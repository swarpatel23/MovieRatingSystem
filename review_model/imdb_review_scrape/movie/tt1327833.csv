" Beautiful","Sorry bhai is the testimony to the fact that Bollywood is moving forward and the new crop of directors on the right track. The performances have all been wonderful. Sharman Joshi is developing as a good actor and if he chooses his films wisely he can one day become one of the best. Sanjay Suri proves that he is the best from among all model turned actors. The chemistry between Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi is better than what is between most actors and actresses today. They both look a very good pair on screen. Chitrangadha Singh is not only a good actress but is one of the most beautiful ladies of Bollywood and she proves that one can look sensual and hot without shedding clothes. Sharman Joshi has a tinge of comedy in his acting which is only going to help him achieve greatness.Now about the story and direction. The story is fresh and is shot beautifully. The family relations - between brothers, mother and son, father and son, husband and wife - have been portrayed excellently. There is not an instance in the film where you will get bored. A very good script supported by some really good performances makes Sorry Bhai a real good movie. A must watch.This year has given us some really good 'not so commercial' movies and Sorry Bhai can be said to be the top runners among them.It breaks my heart to see films like Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna and other crappy movies like those getting nominated and winning awards just because they are made by a known director and are under a big banner whereas some really good movies and performances like this one just sits and watch. Its high time we have an Oscar like award for Bollywood movies where awards are given to performances, characters and not people who are influential." 
" awesome work by ONIR once again","as was expected by ONIR and the 5 main actors of this movie, the movie is simply great. no one disappoints in the movie. the director has chosen each actor for the right character and has managed to get the best out of each. the story is well dealt as was the case in the movie 'My Brother Nikhil'. suttleness stays throughout. this story as the tag line says deals with a situation of a guy falling in love with his brother's wife. the story's major part is set in a flashback and is supposed to happen in Mauritius. humor remains in the movie at every stage. the audiences enjoy the son's(sharman joshi), dad's (boman irani) and the mom's (shabana azmi) relation. amazing dialogues and superb delivery makes sure one falls off the seat laughing. chitrangada singh looks really good throughout and will definitely carry on the tag the next 'smita patil'. sanjay suri also plays the role to the best potential.overall a superb watch. i enjoyed it. hope you people also do." 
" Fresh and utterly entertaining","I started watching it alone not realizing that it was something that I needed to see with my wife as it turned out to be an extremely engrossing entertainer. Sharman Joshi is someone who I have come to look upon as a talented actor but I could never remember his name until this film. His uncanny ability to deliver comedy effortlessly both impresses and surprises me. Boman Irani and Shabana have real chemistry. They are not just bystanding, intervening, stereotypical Hindi-film parents. They are integral to the storyline. Chitrangada Singh (I never new her name before this film) has not had to try hard (or wear less clothes or wear crazy outfits) to look gorgeous. No crazy mind-numbing jhango sets or bolly-typical dresses to insult one's taste and intelligence. No boorish loud mouths filling the gaps in creativity, or tear jerking long drawn out funerals and death scenes. These folks looked like real people with real lives that people identify and connect with. Songs are well chosen and well blended and do not stick out like a sore thumb breaking the continuity of narrative. I wanted to listen to more of its music after the film was over. I attribute a large part of the success of its music to KK's Mere Khuda. Joyful experience. Would like to see more of Hindi films along the same lines." 
" A movie made from heart, by heart and for heart","Sometimes the title eludes you, and trust me, 'Sorry bhai' is not best of the title that one can grab a movie while browsing the video store. But I surely am going to change that habit, because of this movie. If it wasn't for a good friend of mine, this gem would have slipped under my radar. Wow, it surely was one of the best 5 movies of the year 2008 (though I will be really hard-pressed to name the other four). And I haven't seen a single movie directed by Onir yet - so I make it a point to watch other two. And I have been searching for the DVD of Hazaron for quite sometime. The performances in the movie are top notch, everyone gives a solid, very controlled, and powerful performance. I didn't know who the actress was, but by the end of the movie, I was eager to know who she was, coz I knew everyone else but her. Now I am so looking fwd to DevD by Anurag Kashyap. Absolutely endearing story, though I couldn't convince myself with the ending. Direction, Spot on! Very well directed the emotional conflicts (emosanal atyachar?), the dilemma, the love, the hate and the confusion! The most jarring part of the movie is the 'Sorry bhai' song during the end titles! Guess they made the song for the promos, and thought they might include it in the movies as well, for posterity! It was during titles, so I didn't mind it, while being busy reading the titles through the moving white figures. Music wise, 'Mere Khuda' is yet another powerful ballad form KK, dependable as always! Rest all songs are okay, thankfully doesn't come on the way of narrative!I wish there was little more noise on this movie, so more people would have come to know this sensible movie.2008 has been a year of the B-side movies (if there is such a term) - all the big banner movies starting Jodha till Ghajini are full of disappointment! However the movies like this one, Dasvidaniya, Oye Lucky, Rock On, and few others are the REAL winners.Must watch, this one!" 
" Something very different, beautiful, worth watching, bhai!","Sorry Bhai! Sounded like a very stupid title for a movie. But once I saw the film, it made all sense and nothing else, Bhai!. It is a tale of two brothers, their upper middle class Indian parents, ambitions, and a girl.The movie starts off with some very slow dialogues and without much direction towards what is coming in the next 1.5 hours. It slowly and steadily gains more meaning. In short, it tells you what everyone feels, but is untold in Indian cinema. It gets those hidden feelings that a guy can have towards his brother's fianc√©, out of the closet, and on your face. Difficult to digest? But it does it in a way that you don't even feel awkward about it. It adds meaning to it. A perfect script, could have been a bit more crisp, and some better acting by all the cast, would have gained this one 9/10. But I'll still give this bold attempt to show the society what happens to 'normal people' and how they deal with it, a 7/10." 
" Sorry Onir","I love that Onir includes novel themes in his movies and wonderfully presents them through the story rather than preach like he did with his first two films 'My Brother Nikhil' and 'Bas Ek Pal' (both are movies that I love). Similarly, 'Sorry Bhai' too has something new for the Indian audience. However, this time Onir fails to meet up the level of his other films.The main problem is the script. There's not just enough meat and the pacing is too slow in the beginning. The relationship between Harsh and Aaliyah is poorly portrayed. They have been together for five years and yet she chooses not to tell him about her feelings towards Sid and ends up cheating on him with his brother. At the same time, Harsh seems to have forgiven them too fast and too easily. The writer seems confused with the characters and the ending appears rushed. The cinematography is inconsistent because some scenes are shot from poor angles while others are okay. The music is mostly alright and easily forgettable.Mauritius has never looked more beautiful on the Indian movie screen. Onir takes full advantage, not only of the beach locations but also the wildlife reserves and other locals. Mauritius looks much greener than it ever did. Now that was a treat to watch.Sharman Joshi somehow does not fit the part. His acting isn't bad (although he does look a little too confused sometimes) but he is simply miscast. Chitrangda Singh is another treat to watch. She is bedazzling and turns in a decent performance. Shabana Azmi is splendid to watch and Boman Irani too impresses after a long time. Sanjay Suri suffers from bad characterization.Overall, the film is by no means horrendous but it could have easily been a lot better. 'Sorry Bhai' has some shining moments, a few fine performances, eye candy like Mauritius and Chitrangda and some good dialogues but it is Onir's weakest film to date." 
" Sweet and Funny..!!","The biggest reason I was looking forward to Sorry Bhai, was Chitrangada Singh and her comeback. I expected Sorry Bhai to be a good movie since it has beautiful visuals and a good director Onir, with a couple of really good movies to back him up. Well, neither Chitrangada Singh nor the movie actually disappointed me.Scientist Siddharth(Sharman Joshi) is given "Ma Kasam" by elder brother Harsh(Sanjay Suri) to bring her along for his wedding with Aaliyah(Chitrangada Singh) to be held in Mauritius. Their mom(Shabana Azmi) is least interested in attending the wedding because Harsh is getting married against her wishes. Dad(Boman Irani) and Siddharth succeed in bringing mom to Mauritius where Aaliyah is Siddharth's local guide. What happens after they both end up falling in love with each other forms the rest of the film.Sharman Joshi does justice to his unconventional role, unlike his other Bollywood flicks. In fact Sharman and Sanjay just appear irreplaceable in their characters once You've seen the movie. Chitrangada Singh not only looks extremely good throughout but also comes out with a brilliant and a natural performance. The older couple, Shabana Azmi and Boman Irani who with their chemistry after Honeymoon Travels, definitely give the younger screen couples a run for their money.The music is average with the best track being "Mere Khuda". A few misses here and there but all in all a good movie." 
" A no fuss and sensible comedy","For a limited cast of only five characters, Sorry Bhai is a markedly refreshing departure from standard Bollywood rom com fare. The movie plays around with a simple theme of sibling equations as influenced by the catalyst called the elder siblings fianc√©e. The script is a typical take on the 'dysfunctional-family-comes-together-for-a-cause' mold. Harsh (Sanjay Suri) has been away from his family for a while his younger brother Sid (Sharman Joshi) tries for a research grant for his latest hypothesis. When Harsh decides to get married to Aaliyah (Chitrangada Singh), he pleads his younger brother to get his parents, especially his mom for the wedding. The fun in dysfunctional is put in by the antics of the parents, played with superb chemistry by Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. They take this one further than their first stint as a couple in Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd.Sharman Joshi as the genius younger brother does a pretty good job keeping up his boyish yet mature image while Chitrangada Singh essays a role that perhaps doesn't present her as much of a challenge as the one in her debut did. For an actress of her potential, this is just about par for the course and she is underutilized. On the brighter side, the scenes shared by her and Shabana Azmi deserve special mention. Sanjay Suri exudes quiet confidence as usual and it fits his big brother persona perfectly. The slow narrative (you sort of expect that with a limited cast of characters) is a bit of a dampener though the locales of Mauritius provide a picturesque background for the well shot scenes.Sorry Bhai deserves a watch, at least for being far better off than the apology of a movie that other comedies have become." 
" Something New, Unique, Exciting, and Very Brilliant To Watch!","After a Long time I had such a good time at Movies, I really like Sherman joshi and as always he proved to be the best at every situation in this Movie. Brilliant Concept, BEAUTIFUL SETTING in Mauritius. Boman Irani is the most versatile actor ever, his chemistry with Shabana Azmi is truly worth watching. The main actress was quite Hot and shud be given roles to more movies, Sanjay Suri is also a very nice actor, this whole pair was an great choice. Overall fantastic Movie for a night out. Since it wasn't so Over hyped I thought it's gonna be just another random movie, but it catches ur attention from the start and keeps u Locked on till the End. Kudos to the Director!!!" 
" The film's plot may be simplistic, but the film is more about the characters","Taking the decidedly uncomfortable premise of a man hooking up with his brother's girl, Sorry Bhai is a brave little film that puts a fresh spin on the tale. Bumbling younger brother Sharman Joshi arrives in Mauritius with his parents Shabana Azmi and Boman Irani to attend elder brother Sanjay Suri's wedding, and ends up falling in love with his brother's fianc√©e Chitrangada Singh. The triangle that ensues involves Sharman, Chitrangada and ‚Äì no, not Sanjay who seems to wisely move on ‚Äì but the boys' overbearing mother Shabana who gets herself irreparably entangled in this awkward mess. At the very core of Sorry Bhai's drama is the magnificent Shabana Azmi who takes her role and immediately sinks her teeth into it, constructing a character that is all flesh-and-blood. From the little moments ‚Äì like the one in which she follows Sharman and Chitrangada into the woods, only to hurt her foot before she can confirm her suspicions ‚Äì to the significant ones (which include her clashes with her daughter-in-law to be), Shabana is always on the ball, and makes her character omnipresent in the movie, even when she's not physically around in every frame.A word of praise also for the immensely gifted Boman Irani who has a tougher job at hand ‚Äì making a solid believable person out of what was probably a three-line character sketch on paper. Boman adds the right comic touch and just the perfect hint of melancholy to create an affectionate lug of a father who speaks less but delivers gems every time he does. The plot of Sorry Bhai may be simplistic, but the film is not so much about the plot as it is about the characters, and director Onir does a fine job of writing complex, flawed characters who don't come with any easy answers. Chitrangada's character, for one, is a tough nut to crack ‚Äì why does she appear almost unaffected when Sanjay puts off their wedding to attend to a pressing business commitment; why does she suddenly decide to pursue Sharman with such dogged determination; does she really feel no responsibility to Sanjay for what's just happened? These are important questions all, but the answers are hard to find. Much like life, if you think about it. Of the three leads, Sharman Joshi plays his part with such sincerity, you're willing to look at his flawed character with renewed sympathy. The radiant Chitrangada Singh is awkward in places, but puts up a good show nevertheless, especially in her scenes with Shabana. Sanjay Suri, despite the weak characterisation, does the best he can with his role, in particular nailing the film's one defining scene in which Sharman makes the big confession, to which he responds with shock, anger, and even a little affection. Sorry Bhai is not devoid of faults ‚Äì the film occasionally gets too talkie, and in some places a little silly too ‚Äì but the film's real charm lies in those memorable moments the director creates between his two favorite players ‚Äì Shabana and Chitrangada. That's the reason to watch this film.It's a strong character-driven drama about imperfect people trying to find their own happiness in the world. Don't miss it." 
" Too bold and startling for the Indian audiences ..","Onir has made the heartfelt My Brother Nikhil and the ponderous Bas Ek Pal before this, and must have wanted to do a romantic comedy-drama for a change, but maybe this is just not his genre.He fails to hold your attention for two hours. The biggest blame for the same goes for the poor scripting. Sorry Bhai is predictable from the word go and the dull pace literally puts you off to sleep. The film "Sorry Bhai" has a set of elderly couple romancing on screen and three youngsters who are confused over their relationship. The film has a simple script with no twists and turns but the actors are smart to make the show less tedious. A few moments in the film are catchy and most of the part is predictable. The film has been shot in Mauritious and the locations are beautiful. Actors are non glamorous but effective performers and dialogues are impressive. Only weakness is the script that has low scope to get dramatic. Sharman Joshi as the younger shy brother looks fine in his role. Shabana Azmi and Boman are amazing and their on screen chemistry has been exploited well in the film. Sanjay Suri is OK. Chitra looks OK performance wise. A Below Average Flick ..." 
" Best work of Onir so far!!","I had watched this movie with many a premonitions in my mind...believe me for a bollywood movie, this on really sets some standards : whether be it for a good script, a good casting or overall holistic treatment given to the movie.Sorry Bhai is the story of a family which goes to attend the wedding of its 'prodigal' son in Mauritius. As it is obvious from the title the story then focuses on an another obvious theme : 'a love triangle'. But if you dismiss this movie right about now, saying that you have been there and seen such kind of movies, its very unlikely that you are wrong. For bollywood doesn't produce such good and seasoned films many times in a year ...and as the year 2008 has almost come to an end, Sorry Bhai definitely earns it place in the elite cadre.To mention about the strengths, this movie has definitely got everything in place : its actors, it beautiful location (in Mauritius of course) and a storyline (which except for some points in time seems to be a bit immature/unacceptable for Indian audiences) never loses track or its feel-good factor.IF you are expecting a totally masala flick from this movie, then I suggest you give his one a miss, but if all you want to do is watch a movie and have a good feeling about it at the end then this one is definitely for you.My rating 9/10 ...the reason for 9 being that it falls short of a little more panache and mature screenplay/dialogues which definitely could be incorporated at certain portions during the film. But what the heck, I believe all of you who would be watching the movie, would be your own judge for that matter." 
" Just don't waste your time!!","I was shocked how they ripped the family value apart. Boman role was great but the whole story doesn't hold good as ending is known and it is simply hard to watch how much profanity can be there.Not at all watch able. especially with your family People with twisted mind may love it , however watch out for it.So stay away , stay awake . . .Also the role were strongly acted, but the whole story is not fitting the bill.I have rated it 1/10 and I think the trend will follow. Watch some other movie but not this." 
" Brilliant acting, great sense of humour: A must watch","The title kinda gives it away, but this movie is about Aliyah engaged to Harsh(Sanjay Suri), the elder son of Gayatri and Navin (Shabana Azmi and Boman Irani). Aliyah wants to get to know her in law's. Ma, Papa and younger bro Siddhart(Sharman Joshi) start spending time with each other. Ma is typical mom in law, questioning Aliyah about anything and everything, Pa tries to pull down the pressure with his humor, and Siddhart wants to be friends with Aliyah. Somewhere in between Siddhart and Aliyah start falling for each other. Will Harsh understand? Will Ma and Pa understand ? Beautiful story, with great characters, you can actually picture every mom as Shabana and every dad as Boman. Great chemistry between all five actors, one can connect with every character and sympathize. This film will not disappoint, leaves you hanging and wondering until the very end. Excellent humor, absolutely brilliant acting by all 5 actors, the ending is very touching, and very very sweet !!" 
" Idealistic film","Superb and absolute refreshing movie. Family should watch it together.Beautiful location and nice scripting as well.Acting was also too good.Path breaking film for Indian society. Great film. I saw it after Kapoor & sons. Still I believe this is much better.Without any 2nd thought go for it." 
" Don't miss it!","It's too vague a title to convey much, which is why, I'm guessing, not many would have seen it. And those that have, haven't taken too well to it. Reason? Tad too unconventional for a Bollywood film! I happened to pick up the DVD only recently. But unlike my fuzzy scattered thoughts on it, the film came as a pleasant surprise. It's different, its fresh (save a few scenes, I didn't mind ignoring) with a subject that's been dealt with, unctuously. The film revolves around chalk-and-cheese brothers - Siddharth (Sharman Joshi), who rejoices in the simple pleasures of life, Harsh (Sanjay Suri), a freakin' workaholic; and Harsh's fianc√©e Aaliya (Chittranghada Singh), a character that appears practical and level-headed initially but enigmatic, later (for most part of the film). Harsh, who leaves home years back, to work abroad (in Mauritius) is now ready to tie the knot with Aaliya. He calls Dad (Boman Irani), Ma (Shabana Aazmi) and his bro Siddharth, to be part of this 'very special day of his life' to Mauritius. As Aaliya spends time with Harsh's family, she realizes this is not how she'd pictured her life to be. What ensues is to watch out for! The characters aren't white or black (somewhere, there's a mystifying aspect to each of them). Sharman and Boman (yes!) steal the show here. Sharman's mama's-boy-evolves-into-a-man-who-dares-to-defy act is on the ball! He play a scientist (out of all the professions!) who's out there to prove a classic (read: nonsensical) theory. When he's not breaking his head over this theory, he indulges in his saxophone. His other interests include Jazz. Sharman, as an actor, is brilliant. His subtle expressions convey more than his dialogues. He is one underrated actor in the industry. Boman, with a cheerful disposition, is a sweetheart! He lightens up the screen each time he appears, with his mischievously hilarious repartees, directed mostly at his dear wife. He and Shabana share a great on screen presence (I enjoyed watching them in Honeymoon Travels!) At 54 and 59 (Shabana is six years older), they heart-warmingly :) justify the word 'chemistry.' The film is not without its flaws, but it's certainly a one-time watch. Don't be misled by the wishy-washy title. It's a sweet lil film! Go watch it!
