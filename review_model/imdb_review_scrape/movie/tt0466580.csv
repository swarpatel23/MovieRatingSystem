" A mess of a good story line!!!","I would say that the story line was pretty good...but the Director made a big mess of it...It could have been made in a much better way...It started of good, but lost the grip on the viewers as the film progressed. Neha Dupia did a pretty decent job. Sachin Khedekar as the confused husband was pretty decent although nothing extraordinary. He stuck to his script. Sonu Sood was a disappointment!! His role as the rapist was not at all convincing....I didn't like the climax also much and Sonu Sood's transformation from the innocent victim to the cruel rapist wasn't convincing at all. The last scene where the rapists kid and wife comes inquiring about her husband felt like the director was trying to answer question from viewers. That scene could have been avoided completely if the climax was done in a better way.Overall, I would say I was pretty keen to see the movie reading about the story line but tt failed my expectations!!!!" 
" Another pathetic and cheap rip-off from Bollywood","Honestly, I haven't seen the movie, but from the trailer,It can be easily inferred that this time, the victim is Roman Polanski's "Death and the Maiden". Now, you will say, you haven't seen the movie, how can you say that. If you don't believe me, 50 votes and 5 out of 10 rating should be enough for you.Neha Dhupia who first relied on exposure for success but later showed potential, is not at all at fault here. She only did her job.When these people will start making some real movies and will stop ruining masterpieces."
