" Beautifully messy piece","Vishal Bhardwaj's films are generally masterfully crafted, whether it's the high production values, the narrative style, the superb acting or the beautiful music. Kaminey is no exception. Bhardwaj is an integral part of every such aspect in his film. He uses the best technical advances, he pays attention to the smallest of details, he extracts never-seen-before performances by his actors, and insists that he be the one who composes the film's music and score. His unique direction is aided by excellent cinematography, great editing and very well-written dialogues.Kaminey is about two estranged twin brothers, both of whom are slightly (and funnily) limited. The one lisps, the other stammers. An incredibly twisted plot that reveals many little truths through flashbacks and confessions from time to time, it depicts a world of drugs, gangsters, murder and crime. The twin characters are very well written and defined. Charlie is a guy who lives life as if there was no tomorrow. He is cruel and carefree. Guddu is a simple guy who considers himself a duffer yet he has many plans for the future and has a relationship with a simple Marathi girl.The acting is very good. Shahid Kapoor gives a fine performance, excellently displaying the differences of the two characters he plays. Additionally, he does what could have seemed to be very difficult (lisping, stammering) with noted ease and conviction. Priyanka Chopra in a much smaller part provides great support with her hysterical and hilariously loud Marathi girl. Without taking anything from the main lead, the one who completely blew me away, however, is Amol Gupte, who is simply outstanding in his natural and funny act as Bhope.Kaminey is messy yet beautifully so, it is dark yet artistically so. It has hilarious comedy, emotional drama, and many great moments. It is not overdone, and one more noteworthy aspect about Vishal's films is that unlike many current filmmakers, he does not try to make them overly western and modern to make them more mass-appealing. He prefers to centre more on the rural India and show its uniqueness. Kaminey is one such film, and it presents the rural life, maybe not in a totally positive way, but certainly in a fairly realistic one. All in all, I recommend Kaminey. I wouldn't exaggerate by saying it's the best, but it is an impressive, visually stunning and entertaining picture." 
" Dhan Te Nan","Well if you thought that the song Dhan Te Nan which you see on various TV channels is frantic,just wait till you see this pumped-up heavy duty movie. The film begins with a chase sequence near the local trains of Mumbai.And from then on the pace of the movie never drops as it hurtles towards an explosive climax where all bets are off about who'll make it and who will not. The basic story revolves around a "Guitar" to which many people are connected directly or indirectly.Its a story about the decisions which we make in our life and what impact they have on us and the people around us. The movie has a large number of characters but its the beauty of screenplay and the Director that they all become memorable ones and not just forgettable names. Chief among them is Mikhail(Chandan Roy Sanyal) as Charlie's best friend. Amol Gupte is menacing as the villain. Priyanka Chopra who is riding high these days once again shows that she is a very capable actress and not just a pretty girl. Shahid Kapoor has always been a good actor in the simpleton Guddu type roles,but here he literally burns the screen as the whacko race-bookie Charlie.The tremendous passion which he brings to screen really keeps the viewers riveted to this scintillating saga of twin brothers. And finally... THE MAN.VISHAL BHARADWAJ. He literally makes the film what it is with the best direction and music that i've seen in any Hindi movie in a long long time. Take a bow Mr. Vishal Bharadwaj.You have really made a movie which shows how the movies should really be made.My Rating >> 10/10" 
" Dhan Te Nan!","Kaminey is one of those gems which is churned out by the the Bollywood film industry maybe once in five years. If it has to be described in one word, I think 'Extraordinary' would be a good one. Nobody would disagree with the fact that Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra have both established themselves as fine actors as they delivered the performances of their career. Vishal Bhardawaj once again proves why he is counted amongst the elegant filmmakers that India has to offer. This film will surely help Bollywood break out of the barricades of outdated film making, and shift towards a more contemporary technique of pleasing audiences. Vishal Bhardawaj himself will agree that Kaminey is his most outstanding film till date. 9.5/10" 
" Difcover your mean fide","The much awaited Vishal Bharadwaj's 'Kaminey' finally hit cinema screens and it does not disappoint! The primary thing that you will notice and appreciate in the movie is the acting. From the main characters Charlie and Guddu ( identical twins played by Shahid Kapoor ) till the supporting actors, everyone manages to impress you. Special mention would go to Priyanka Chopra, who plays Guddu's love interest Sweety, who nails the role to perfection.The movie shows the parallel lives of identical twins Guddu and Charlie who detest each other and haven't seen each other in years but how circumstances lead them to face each other. The plot is gripping, the acting is flawless, the setting is dark and the direction is slick. Probably the only thing that could have been better is the ending. Though the ending wasn't bad, I guess I had a little more expectations hoping for something darker or unexpected. But all in all a fun movie not to be missed!" 
" Kaminey - A MaFterpieFe!!","I would only say one thing to the viewers.. If they do not accept such a matured cinema.. Such excellence on screen.. They should probably stop blabbering about movies... Because they know nothing, what a movie, cinema means! They are all just suitable for stupid "Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi's" and etc crap.. GROW UP!! And if you can't.. Please do not comment on gems like these.."KAMINEY" is a lifetime experience.. A masterpiece and a fantabulous creation of Vishal Bhardwaj.. The movie is a TOTAL ROLLER COASTER!! A ride you would regret for the rest of your life if you miss.. From the first scene to the last, the movie was a treat to me.. I was so excited about this movie, I couldn't resist.. Wondered when the clock would turn to10:30 .. And the show begins.. It completely paid off.. In fact I enjoyed more than I paid for the ticket, more than my expectations and more than any bollywood movie of such a genre till now.. The movie deserves awards in various sections like editing, cinematography, background score, special effects, direction, acting, supporting actors.. It amazed me how disgustingly good the editing was!! Tassaduq Hussain's Cinematography is another strength of the movie... And my god!! Vishal Bhardwaj's Screenplay & self-penned dialogues will blow your head off at times!! Top Notch!!A concept like Kaminey is extremely difficult to execute on screen.. But Vishal Bhardwaj proves that he's a brilliant story-teller.. Be patient while watching the movie & also attentive, the movie jumps too quick for Indian viewers who aren't used to with such cinema and more attached towards the brainless movies these days! The movie stands up-to its hype & even more I should say.. Shahid has no, mark my words, no looking back after this performance.. His path to super-stardom starts here! Priyanka delivers another class act! She's the best actress in the industry currently, no other actress even stands close.. Shahid, Vishal Bhardwaj & the background score has created a landmark in the industry for centuries to come in terms of cinematic excellence..I cannot agree anymore with Mr. Taran Adarsh when he says "Vishal Bhardwaj picked up the characters & executed them like Tarantino & Guy Ritchie.." You'll totally agree with that!It is clearly visible how hard the whole crew has worked to attain perfection, because the movie WAS PERFECT in every aspect!! Upcoming directors have one of the biggest threats Vishal Bhardwaj in their way, if they at all touch a subject close to this..Shahid, Priyanka, Chandan Roy Sanyal (Mikhail), Amol Gupte (Bhope) were truly, truly outstanding!!I feel short of words to describe this movie.. I seriously cannot wait to watch it again.. Of course I'm going again, but will badly badly wait for the DVD.. Not to forget, the end of the movie was simply ---- FANTABULOUS ----If you truly enjoy cinema, go for KAMINEY.. Else, better wait for SRK or FARAH KHAN's next POPCORN FLICK!! Go for Kaminey for Shahid, for Priyanka, for Vishal Bhardwaj, for the Music & for everything you want from a masterpiece! And next time you end up comparing why do Bollywood standards do not reach Hollywood, stay quite! You don't deserve a word!I love dark movies.. The environment, the sets, the cinematography in such movies.. Really intrigue me a lot.. Kaminey had that thing from the first till the last frame.. I cannot stop my fingers from writing.. Anyways..I've always been obsessed THE MATRIX TRILOGY, Kaminey is the fresh obsession I have..Rating : 10/10 (Deserves every bit of it!)" 
" dark adventurous movie to keep you edged on the seats","We've seen so much of the RGV stuff about " Jai Maharashtra" and the style. plus, talk about 'judwa' movies .. There are things which might make you feel there's something familiar what Kaminey offers. NOT.Well, attempting a dark comedy is difficult, especially about mafia (that too in the settings of maharashtra). The movie is a dark comedy, with an adventurous plot and an action setting. The movie almost achieves what it wants to. its brilliant in execution, with some freelance direction and good screenplay. the story revolves around parallel tracks of brothers wanting to live their own lives, but they're bound to collide. The storytelling warps in the movie where we witness a normal movie and then suddenly so much happens that you fee like rewinding back. The pace is varying and there is something to keep you edged on your seat. And the final scene comes similar to "lock, stock and 2 smoking barrels", in an Indian environment, really perfect, spotless direction.The direction just in-phase with the contemporary age of experimental cinema. we see perfect lighting for the scenes and low shots in the movies. the songs are nice, too. the movie in whole is a great watch for people who have the taste of seeing action or adventure scripts. A nice movie, watch it.Shahid's acting is good, limited in his roles but very methodical. priyanka tries a kareena of JWM (or the asin of Ghajini, for that matter) and plays it smoothly. However, editing the viewer with a lost feeling sometimes. There are certain potholes scattered throughout the movie, which could have either explained or avoided, at least. and yes, the movie seems a little predictable sometimes, but its maximum criticism it deserves. go on experimenting Bollywood ! o ya, n i really wonder why it got A certificate .. there is nothing A about it.." 
" Yeah Baby!!!","Vishal Bharadwaj has done it again. After tense stories of Maqbool & Omkaara, he takes a deliberate take away from Shakespeare and delivers instead an awesome dark and twisted tale of two brothers each with his own share of mess to take care of, not to mention their speech impediments that provide some great sounding dialog to the audience and depth to the characters. The film does not try to emulate one as the good brother and the other gone wrong. That's not what the director wants to show.One brother knocks up a Don's sister unknowingly (the buildup to this is awesome) and the other one chances upon a guitar full of cocaine.As the plot thickens, both the brothers must gets their hands on the same cocaine to save their lives. Then, the director takes on a joyride through the shanty towns of Mumbai.The film has strong overtones of the current issues in Mumbai politics and a leading lady in Priyanka Chopra, who is very much representative of present day Indian girl. She is no arm candy, she has a pivotal role and takes the film to its climax. A climax that drags on with one little twist after another, but it is't boring. by the end of it, you would want another. The music is very good and does not interfere with the pace of the film. Gulzar has again delivered deep meaning lyrics that are more in sync with the film's theme than with classic poetry.There are a lot of characters to take care of in the film and it's easy to lose to track, but none is less important than the other. Each one has a defined part and is intertwined in the destinies of Guddu & Charlie. It does remind you of Guy Ritchie films like Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels etc but it is in no way an imitation of such works. It is a complete masterwork in its own right.With Jab We Met, Shahid Kapur showed that he can carry a film on his own, Kaminey shows that that two of him are better than one. He plays both his parts with such panache that its hard to see that its the same actor. This could well be the point when he lands more serious roles and less of the boy next door.The film is dark with everybody fighting for survival but the presentation is such that you do feel for the people in it but can't help but sadistically laugh at them. that is what Bhardwaj has been able to achieve with Kaminey which very few directors in India can manage to.Definitely one of the best works of contemporary Indian cinema." 
" Amazing film. One of the best films of Indian cinema.","You can't believe how much anticipation I had for this movie(I loved Awarapan, also a gangster movie). This movie passed each expectation. Amazing songs(especially the title track and Dhan Te Nan), enthralling action, mind-blowing story, shocking performances(in a good way), and an ecstatic execution through and through. Shahid's performance along with Priyanka's, Amole Gupte's and everyone's performance make me speechless. They all fit in their roles. Shahid as Charlie steals the show. Priyanka looked her best in Dostana, but she looks angelic with no makeup(and still hot).What I liked about the movie: Shahid, Priyanka, Amole, action, run-out of the mill songs(especially the ones mentioned above), photography.BEST FILM OF THE YEAR. MY FAVORITE BOLLYWOOD MOVIE EVER.What I didn't like about the movie: Too short, like Awarapan. Come on, 135 minutes? What about 150, at least?! my review from bollywoodhungama.com" 
" A perfect dark comedy !","Thats what Monsieur Godard would call this film - a time pass; yet reasonably after Shekhar Kapur's comment on an esteemed daily Vishal Bhardwaj is being compared widely to Quentin Tarantino, a comparison, I feel is much forced rather than reasoned. With Kaminey Vishal Bhardwaj breaks his own elan & generates what we can call India's first perfect dark comedy. Amusingly, Vishal Bhardwaj once again displays his Shakespearean love. this time morsel of 'A Comedy of Errors', yet many may disagree. A fine work by a finer film-maker. Watch this movie without 'Maqbool' or 'Omakara' in your mind.On a totally different note, the music of this film is exceptional, well versed by another genius in his own kind - Gulzar.A must watch." 
" Coming of Age Cinema","The most eagerly awaited movie of the year is finally out. The good part is that it lives up to its expectations. Vishal Bharadwaj delivers another one in his list of what can be definitely called as the new age Indian cinema.The movie is smart, witty, dark, and funny all at the same time. It is one roller coaster ride that leaves you gasping for breath. It demands so much out of you as a viewer that one can't really afford to miss anything. You blink and it's gone.The story is fast paced and the script is rock solid. The characters have been chalked out well where each actor gets his / her space to deliver and deliver they do. Where Shahid Kapur delivers one of his best performances till date, the new faces in the movie are the surprise elements. They deliver their part with such panache that leaves you spellbound.However, it is truly a director's movie. Vishal has, like his previous ventures, taken movie making in India to a different level and respected the modern audience who have moved ahead from the run of the mill trash to a more practical / sensible work.Without giving anything away from the movie, recommend you to watch it to believe it. Watch it for the Director who respects the sensibility of his audience, watch it for the actors who deliver an earnest performance, watch its for its dark , subtle humor, watch it to be thoroughly entertained." 
" Great Movie!!","Kaminey is a latest off track bollywood movie. Since its a off-track many may just don't like the way its presented to the audience. The film is about human nature and the way world treats people. If you are poor, if you are uneducated you are lost in this world of selfishness and power. You need to grow up in this world.Saheed Kapoor in his double role has acted superb. His performance is adorable and I now like him much more than before. Its a bollywood movie with some sort of Hollywood taste. Its out off movie. A fast paced movie with lots of laughter & humor.If you love gangster movie and deserve some new taste just watch this movie. A must for fans of Saheed Kapoor." 
" Its an "Acquired taste"","Vishal Bharadwaj takes a break from Shakeshpeare and decides to give the Bollywood audience a break from candy-floss films (read that as K-Jo, YRF and their lookalikes!). He gives us a taster session of Tarantino & Guy Ritchie, famed for their distinct style of film-making. Unique (and loony) characters, tension-building scenes, unexpected turn of events, razor-sharp lines, strong background score - you name it "Kaminey" has all the ingredients. There is no "Once upon a time....." business here, the audience find themselves thrown into the middle of quagmire owing to which in the first few reels you find find yourself gasping to comprehend. Not being funny, but only the smart & intelligent stay with the proceedings. Brilliant performances from all actors, including the host of new faces.۩ Shahid Kapur:: Guddu & Charlie - not exactly "chalk-and-cheese" there, as you would normally expect in a storyline of identical twins. Let's say one is slightly more deceitful. Divide the stutter and lisp between them and Shahid gets a role of his lifetime which he delivers with utmost perfection.۩ Priyanka Chopra:: Just about completing her home-run and needless to say her performance as the Maharashtrian girl is a feather in the cap.۩ Amol Gupte:: Another Mahesh Manjrekar in the making. ۩ Deb Mukherjee:: Nice to see him after a long sabbatical, though short- role."Dhan Te Nan" is an obvious scene-stealer while the rest of the numbers would take sometime to catch up. Gulzar's lyrics as usual is mystical.Crap was the word that first came to my mind when I watched "Pulp Fiction" but it took a couple of years of maturity to retrace my steps and appreciate the body of work. It goes without saying "Kaminey" deserves a second-time watch to get the gist and perhaps a few more to notice the grammar of fine film-making." 
" Dhan Te Nan... watch itKaminey!","Well this is most awaited movie for this Manfoon....and i have not sleep all night as my wife is out town, i just patiently wait for 9.00 to see first show......you think now i'm crazy ....but yes its well worth....its best movie this year. (caution!!! Please don't bring popcorn or coke with you...no time to blink eyes)Its begin with Dhan Te Nantwo brothers, a world apart, in complete hate with each. One in love with the over the top- Sweety, the other in love with money. One an aspiring white colour-currently NGO worker, the other a small time fixer hoodlum with dreams of owning his own booking Khidki at the local racetrack. One a cutely lisper, the other 'Ph KO Ph bloat hair'.So is this a Judwa Bhai story? Naaah are Bhai-Bhai supposed to kill each other rather than for each other? Perhaps a love story? But Sweety-Guddu story is only a side show. Maybe an action/gangster movie? But are these supposed to have a brain, except to Bach upThe plot of Kaminey revolves around twins Charlie & Guddu. Charlie lisps (using F at place of S and believes that life has two options, one shortcut and second Chota shortcut and he had a dream of opening his own bookie counter ) where as Guddu trips over his tongue. Though they are twins but nature wise they are different (Wo Chalta Hain, main Bhagta Hun:- as Charlie says) and cant stand the sight of one another. But at one eventful day they came across each other when Guddu decided to marry his love Sweety, sister of Marathi don Bhope and Charlie got mixed up in fixed narcotic deal of Taashi to get rich using Chota shortcut. Now both get involved in the world of coke, politics, corruption, money and guns. Soon they realised that though they hate each other but all they have is each other and then they fight with their fate, gangsters, politicians and corrupted cops to protect themselves and their dreams.A special mention for Shahid Kapur who plays the two characters with skill that comes from years of acting, especially the detail of the speech defects both characters have. Priyanka Chopra is excellent too, but this is clearly a Shahid Kapur film.But the real star is Vishal Bhardwaj; whether it is the music of the film or the story and of course the direction, you have to hand it to the man He tells you a myriad stories in this film and yet brings it all together to tell a cohesive tale. Hats ofThe acting- The star cast was brilliant and I couldn't find a single flaw with any actor or role. Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra without doubt were mind blowing, but so were all the other actors. For once we had actors not faking the'Bengali accent' or have a 'bhai' or 'yeda' thrown in for the Marathi feel. Though subtitles during the slightly longer Bengali sentences would've helped non Bengali's to understand the dialogues, the acting made sure that we grasped what was happening.The music- What can i say but Dhan tenon... TA TA tan Tana!! The music was simple superb and I had to literally hold on to my seat for fear of jumping up and dancing.All the songs were brilliant, however one song did remind us hugely of Omkara's title song.rush to your near theatres ....Just run like Charlie not like Guddu slow walk either you miss the movie..Hats off to the Story writer of Africa who write this story and Me Bharadwaj is not only good filmmaker a gr8 businessmen too as he brought this Blood diamond in 4000 bucks" 
" Awefome!","Q: What goes through your mind when you go to the theater to watch a highly anticipated movie like 'Kaminey'? A: You want a crisp story, good direction, brilliant performances, nice songs... In other words you want a total paisa vasool show. And Kaminey delivers just that. In these times of utter crappy movies (like Kambakht Ishq) or total bore ones (like New York) or somewhat OK ones (like Love Aaj Kal), this movie comes like a breath of fresh air. And a lot of the credit goes to the director - Vishal Bharadwaj. So lets start with the story. This is probably Shahid's first movie where he has a double role. One as Charlie - a gangster who wants to be a bookie, lisps (pronounces S as F). The other brother, Guddu - an NGO worker who has big dreams, stammers and loves Sweety (played by the gorgeous Priyanka Chopra). Both got separated when their father committed suicide and went separate ways. Then during one of inter-gang-crossfires Charlie hits jackpot when he gets cocaine worth ten crores in the 'guitar' . Guddu gets Sweety pregnant and so has to marry her. But then he realizes that she is the sister of a top goon - Bhope bhau, who in turn wants to become a politician. What follows is a pacey story of how they get out of the mess and claim their lives. Not once will you yawn during the 2 hour show that the story is getting boring. Next about the direction. Typical Vishal Bhardwaj stuff but then you want the same style. Anyone who has seen Omkara would agree that his dark handling does wonders to the movie and never does it get dragged into the typical Ram Gopal Verma style of gangster movies. Now about the performances, Shahid does an commendable job. The biggest difficulty when playing double roles is to keep the two characters separate and Shahid does that part brilliantly. One person's stammering and the other's lisping are executed well. Priyanka does well in whatever small role she gets of Sweety. She has her typical bubbly and sometimes crying persona. Among the other actors, Amol Gupte as Bhope bhau was good too. But its mostly Shahid who dominates. The songs all get overshadowed by one top notch number - Dhan Te Nan and its melody gets repeated throughout the movie. Among the others Pehli Baar Mohabbat is melodious. But rest all just merge well with the movie. In all, a movie definitely worth watching once maybe twice (mostly twice). I bet you would feel satisfied and come out of the theater feeling good that you had a paisa vasool time." 
" merely cool","Let me say right at the outset that I am a huge fan of Vishal Bhardwaj. To me, he is easily the most complete director in Hindi cinema at the moment. And what he's done with Kaminey hasn't changed that, for I can't think of another director who could come close to him even in failure — except perhaps Anurag Kashyap.With Kaminey, for once, I was fully prepared to believe all the hype, and every word of all the rave (at times fawning) reviews. And then I went to see the film, ready to be blown away, as the reviewers said I would be. But it didn't happen.Well, it was entertaining. It was 'fun', as people like to say. But so was Love Aajkal. C'mon, I don't want just 'fun' from a Vishal Bhardwaj film? If I want only 'fun', I would go watch a Priyadarshan or an Imtiaz Ali or a Karan Johar or a David Dhawan flick, not Vishal Bhardwaj. To be sure, Maqbool was fun, too, but it wasn't ONLY fun. Omkara was fun too, but it was also a film that rammed you in the solar plexus. Kaminey, though, is merely fun.Okay, the Dhan te nan is great. Charlie's lisp is fuperbly funny, and I am sure it's going to catch on in offices and campuses as a cool speech defect. The fast-paced editing, the stylized camera-work, the ultra-hip dialogue — it's all very well, Tarantino be damned. BUT, the script (so highly and misleadingly praised by critics) lacked that one element which has always marked out Bhardwaj as a superior director — character development.Those of you who loved Maqbool and Omkara will immediately know what I mean. In Omkara, for example, what lends the script its rock-hard solidity is the character arc of Langda Tyagi, played to perfection by Saif Ali Khan. Combining meticulous characterisatiom with authentic setting and dialogues, Bhardwaj managed to produce cinematic gunpowder that simply blew the audience away.Like in Omkara, in Kaminey too, you've got an interesting array of grey characters — twins who hate each other, a Marathi politician-don, a Tibetan drug-lord, and a feisty love interest. It's a promising enough mix. Now that all the ingredients have been brought together to ensure a gripping plot, what do we do? It is here that things begin to go wrong.First of all, for this film to work in its entirety (as opposed to cool scene by cool scene), it is essential to establish why the twins are estranged in the first place. Bhardwaj knew that. But unlike in Maqbool, where you are seamlessly drawn into Abbaji's past, and unlike Omkara, where the back-story of Omi's (Ajay Devgan) romance with Dolly (Kareena Kapoor) is masterfully woven in, the back-story here is a total mess. The twins' father, whose role is critical to give substance to the divergent personalities of Guddu and Charlie, is less a father and more a plot device. Secondly, the climax is a disaster. Bhardwaj has expended valuable screen time building up characters like 'Tashi the Great' and the crazy Bong brothers — and you see nothing of their individuality or agency in the climax where they supposedly play an important role (this is another area in which the movie falls way short of Reservoir Dogs — a film Kaminey has been compared to — where the explosive climax works precisely because it derives from subtle characterization). Instead, everyone except Guddu, Charlie and Sweety gets killed in a meaningless, unchoreographed mess of a shoot-out sequence. And besides, what were the two black guys doing in the film, anyway? The film would have lost nothing if they'd been edited out, and the screen time thus gained could have been put to better use.But the biggest disappointment of Kaminey is that the all characters are nothing more than cardboard cutouts: the lisping bookie, the stammering Romeo, the cigar-smoking don, the diabetic criminal-politician — none of them engage you beyond the first look. On screen, they spout cool dialogues, and evoke a smile or a laugh. At the human level, they don't exist. Another problem is the pacing of the narrative: it's needlessly fast too much of the time, with the result that you end up just skimming the surface of the story. I can only speculate on the reasons why Bhardwaj messed up with Kaminey. I think he has learnt all the wrong (from the artistic point of view) and right (from the commercial point of view) lessons from his earlier films, Maqbool and Omkara, not to mention Makdee and Blue Umbrella. These films were all critical successes. But for all their cinematic bravura, they were no great shakes commercially. They were not flops by any means, but they didn't exactly set the box office on fire, unlike lesser films by lesser directors with a decidedly lower wattage in terms of star power. Evidently, some concessions were called for. For example, you can't expect to boom at the box office when all your main characters die at the end, can you? As they did in Maqbool and Omkara? To be charitable to Bhardwaj, my guess is that in Kaminey he consciously chose to sacrifice the integrity of the story for a better performance at the box office. And if that was his objective, I think he has succeeded. But its success at the box office would also be an ironic comment on Bhardwaj's own legacy (till Kaminey) as a filmmaker, which is to demonstrate that you can, as a mainstream director, with a mainstream cast, still make films that can compare with any being made in the world for their sheer brilliance and originality.Kaminey, sadly, is neither original nor brilliant. It's merely cool." 
" Kaminey..... not so good!!!!","I am so disappointed with the film that I felt a compulsion to say it and get it out of my system! Tremendously over hyped! The film is doing well in box office only because it is a Vishal Bhardwaj film. I too had gone to the PVR Juhu to watch it as I have loved every single piece of work of Vishal's till now.But this time it didn't work out for me at least! First of all, what was with all the out-of-focus, super-close-extreme-close-ups? And why the hell there was a need felt to have such shaky camera-work?!!!! Why??? It made an already overly confused film even more confusing and difficult to watch. OK the story isn't actually all that confusing, in fact its quite simple. But I felt because the story was so simple that there was nothing to it.I felt the film is just a montage of elongated scenes based on elongated script!!!! Except Dan Te Nan, the music is strictly ordinary. And still the one song that is brilliant (Dan Te Nan), it is so badly shot and edited that all you is just blurs!!!! Somewhere I was seeing Anurag Kashyap in Vishal's work. The use of Reds and Blues, and the strap-on camera etc all reminded of DevD.The film revolves around the two main characters Guddu and Charlie, both of whom have speech disorders. They are both causing each other grief unintentionally. They are pole apart and totally different in even the minutes of the manners. Yet we know that there is going to be confrontation scene between the two soon. And it happens but there is nothing important about it. Just a quick flashback and bang, the scene is done and some how justified to progress the story.Another major grief I have with the film is the inclusion of too many unknown faces, and TOO many characters. They are all supposed to have importance for the story but I found them hard to follow and relate to with any of them. Although I must admit that they all acted very well but the problem lies with the characterization and the story.So overall, I was disappointed!!!! I love Vishal Bhardwaj films but this one didn't work for me!!!! 4 out of 10!!!!"
