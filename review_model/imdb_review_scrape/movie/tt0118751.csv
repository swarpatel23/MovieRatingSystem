" Indian Cinema no. 1","Border (1997) is an bloody war film filled with an hour's worth of singing. The story is about a company of soldiers (most of the Punjabs) who must defend the India/Pakistan border at all costs. Tensions between the two countries were at the boiling point. The Pakistanis were preparing an all out assault on the Indian border. Based upon a real incident, the actors were great in their roles and the film makers made these characters flesh and blood instead of mere cardboard figures. Each has a tale to tell (in song with a lot of musical numbers). Who will win this incredibly high tensioned battle of survival?A great film. I enjoyed it very much. I have watched several Indian films before and if I can find more like these then I can find a new film industry to keep an eye upon. The D.V.D. I saw was in stereo with English sub-titles. Over three hours long and highly entertaining. The violence content is high and a must for action fans and history buffs." 
" In the 1971 war, Pakistan Army opens Western Front by attacking Longewala Post which eventually turns out to be pathetic decision for them","The Movie is an attempt to bring into limelight the Historic Battle of Longewala located in Rajasthan. The Pakistan Army opens Western Front against India to force away Indian effort to liberate Bangladesh from tyrant Pakistani rule.The Pakistani Army assuming that Indian Forces have only limited presence on Western Border attacks through Rajasthan in Longewala. The movie depicts true event and is not a piece of fiction as far as Battle is concerned.Its true that there was a company of only 120 men against almost 2500 Pakistani Troops along with over 60 Tanks engaged in the Battle of Longewala. The Indian Post at Longewala had strategic advantage of being at higher level and also was one of the prime reasons for shameful defeat of Pakistani Tank Column and Infantry at the hands of a handful Indians !!The characters have been carefully chosen and developed beautifully in the movie. The Battle appears almost real with men at their respective positions as in actual battle. The intensity is high and so is the depiction of morale. The Indian Air Force striking the Pakistanis in the morning was clearly seen although there was a little more role that IAF played in actual battle. The dramatic scenes are good enough to make you shed a tear for the unsung heros.Overall the movie is great considering the complexities involved in shooting a real war scene. Its a must watch for all the people who do not know about the battle that is considered a strategic one in defeat the Pakistani Army by Indian Forces in 1971 war.The movie is complete with patriotic moments,is well shot and well delivered. A must watch for every Indian....Also for those who like Real War Flicks!!" 
" The Indian Alamo","A very good war movie, despite somewhat expected chauvinist moments counterpointed by fluffy pacifist messages. Nice exploration of the inner personal dramas of the characters, and how it will affect their battle actions. Some battle scenes are very realistic; others contain elements of mystic heroism, yet the mix works well. The story has the same ingredients of the siege of the Alamo, but in a completely different cultural environment, what gives it a special appeal." 
" Emotions, Actions, consequences","This film is another working of a fantastic experienced talent of J P Dutta. the characters in the film really do shine, and bring out the best performances. The controversial topic of India-Pakistan is really highlighted in this film. The camera work is immaculate and the shooting in the backround of Rajasthan really is breathtaking. The music score by Anu Malik, is melodious and heart rendering. "Sandese Aate Hein" in time has become a patriotic anthem amongst many Indians. This alone implies the impact this film had on the Indian public, the brave sardars played by Sunny Deol and Puneet Issar highlights their love and the determination for India to defend itself against hostile enemies whoever they may be. An excellant production, my wish is for other directors to take a leaf out of Mr. Dutta's book, and make more films along patriotic story themes." 
" Best Indian War Movie Ever!","Border is the best war movie with mind-blowing action. Everyone gave powerful performances, lead by my favorite star, Sunny Deol. He was perfect as the brave Sardarji armyman, and this is definitely his greatest performance of the 90's (even more intense than Ghayal, Ghatak, Ziddi). He is the true action hero above others. He is so inspirational and very commanding to the point that you truly feel the patriotism and determination and love for your nation. This is definitely, one of the most powerful and realistic (based on 1971 Indo-Pak war) action movies that I have ever seen. It is as others say, "Men at their best! War at its worst!" This is a must watch for all Indians who really do love their country. It is shocking that despite the fact that this was the biggest blockbuster in '97, it was practically ignored by the corrupt and biased media. Border should have swept nearly all awards (it was worthy of Oscars). Watch this movie! 12/10." 
" Superb personalization of war","Rarely has an Indian movie depicted the personal traumas that confront soldiers and their families.  Border scores 10/10.  The last song Mere Dushman Mere Bhai was touching.Shows that all the bitter fighting between India and Pakistan is such a gross waste.  It is a case of brother vs brother, and will have no winners in the end." 
" Factual Portrayal","A brilliant film, Definitely a milestone in Indian Film Industry...... Very well directed in actual locales ..... Brilliant acting by Sunny Deol, Sunil Shetty and newcomer Akshaye Khanna." 
" one of the most best war films made","Border is no Saving Private Ryan or behind enemy lines. It's an unpretentious patriotic film, which is great to watch on 15 Aug or 26 Jan. It's heavily dramatised with punching dialogue and touching songs. The characters are varied and likable, and acting doesn't come much better, though Sunny Deol is over the top as usual.It's sad to see this movie trashed by some Pakistani viewers, who are clearly not happy to see a movie made about their war failures. Maybe they should make movies depicting their own point of view, rather than watching pirated copies of Indian movies, and then complaining about them." 
" superb","Superb.I really have pity on some of reviewers who brand movie chauvinistic.How else a war movie is supposed to be? Especially when those whom you are fighting were your own countrymen till a few years back. A pretty good depiction of Indian Army and air force and relationship between different soldiers and their dilemma. Movie also touches on pathetic condition of Indian soldiers financially in those days which is no longer a case.Most haunting scene of Movie is Rakhi wandering in tank ridden field with Serra for his son.This single scene depicts the futility of war. But there should have been paid more attention to details of war e.g. even real life soldiers have said that they were not that outnumbered and main factor was air force not the army but it is true that they did hold a whole battalion with the help of anti tank mines." 
" History of 1971 INDO-PAK war","It is a very good movie directed by J.P Dutta. Describes the reality of what happened in the 1971 INDO-PAK war & how the 120 odd Indian men from PUNJAB REGIMENT were able to defeat the strong Pakistan Army of around 2400 men along with one entire Tank Regiment. Yes, this is true and most of the characters shown in the movie are also true. The music is melodious and one will not regret after watching the movie. The dialogues are OK and could have been better but the action scenes in the movie are mind-blowing. BORDER is a must watch movie for every Indian and also to be proud of what the Indian army has done for them in the past." 
" You say its about war? It is a mere fantasy","This movie is a big joke including LOC Kargil. Five love stories scripted in a war movie. I say it is a mere fantasy. Moreover it seemed so funny when sunny deol emerged as a one man army with a grenade launcher and ruined the Pakistani party as if they were dummies waiting to get destroyed. This movie has lacked research though was surplus in emotions. Lakshya is the best war movie made in India. It really depicted the horror of war thanks to a good sound editing and camera work. And of course Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers have no comparison. These two movies show how much research and technical aspects like sound editing and cinematography are the important pillars or a good film. I don't when Indian directors will understand their importance" 
" Jingoistic drivel","Anti-Pakistani and jingoistic drivel which works only in building patriotism in Indians.  (I guess if Americans can be patriotic by putting down Russians and Arabs all the time, Indians should have the same rights.) Dutta knew he sank to offensive commercial levels and will  next try and redeem himself with the cross-border love story, Refugee.Redeeming factors of Border are beautiful tunes thanks to Anu Malik and Javed Akhtar.  Buy the music album and skip the film." 
" Another stupid Indian war film","Border is about a small military confrontation between India and Pakistan. The facts have been mutilated and heroes have been made larger then life. It was the Indian air force that made a real difference to the outcome. In the movie it is a handful of soldiers that do the job. Even the cook has to take up arms. Apart from an incorrect plot there is hopeless acting and stupid stunts. Take for example a soldier who carries an anti tank mine to a tank after being shot around 20 times all over the body. You can count on more such scenes in the movie. The movie was a big hit in India and the director won acclaims for his direction. Every major characters has a love life and the romance side of their stories makes the movie agonizingly long. Aside from all this junk the movie has some brilliant songs exploring the soldiers life far from his family. "Sandeshe aaten hain" is about soldiers waiting for a message from home, letters ask them . "Jaaten hue lamhon" is about a soldier asking the time to stop because he wants to spend a little more time with his newly wed wife." 
" If this is a good example of Indian film-making, I'd hate to see a bad one","First off, I'm neither Indian nor Pakistani, so I didn't come come to this movie with any feelings about the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war one way or the other. In fact, although I'm fairly well acquainted with the war, I had never heard of this movie, or anyone in it, before I saw it listed on Netflix, and based on the description, I thought it might be interesting so I rented it. Bad move on my part.To begin with, for a film that obviously cost quite a bit of money, it's very sloppily made. It was a bit of a puzzlement when a character starts speaking in English and in the middle of the sentence switches to Hindi, or vice-versa. Don't know why the filmmakers did that, but it's very annoying (as were the completely bizarre musical numbers that were inserted into the middle of the film. Seeing squads of Indian soldiers singing and dancing in the middle of the desert on the eve of war was disconcerting, to say the least. Also, although the film's Hindi dialogue was subtitled in English, the lyrics to the songs weren't. Strange.). The acting for the most part was more reminiscent of an overblown 1909 D.W. Griffith melodrama than a modern (1997) war picture, full of grand theatrical gesturing and overheated, pretentious and ultimately boring stretches of dialogue. The "action" scenes were, to put it mildly, pathetic. I realize this was based on an actual incident, but it must have been VERY "loosely" based because the action consists of wildly improbable and hysterically phony heroics by the Indian soldiers that make the laughable Chuck Norris "Missing in Action" travesties look like documentaries, sneering villainy by the Pakistani side (I almost expected to see the head Pakistani officer twirling his mustache and tying a young girl to the railroad tracks while cackling "Nyah ah ah!") and dialogue that Ed Wood would be too embarrassed to write (one soldier, explaining his mother's blindness, says, "She went blind from the tears she had shed" for her deceased war-hero husband). The special effects are laughable--tanks that get "blown up" are obviously wooden mock-ups, as you can see flaming pieces of wood showering the ground after the explosions and what's left of the tank's "hulk" shattering when it hits the ground, and when some soldiers are "shot" you can see the square outline of the blocks the exploding squibs are attached to beneath their uniforms. One Indian soldier who finds himself in the no-man's-land between the Indian trenches and the attacking Pakistanis suddenly charges the enemy line and is promptly shot about 20 times for his trouble, but amazingly is rescued and brought back to the Indian positions, where he holds on for awhile before finally expiring (after, of course, giving a patriotic speech), while Pakistani soldiers who get shot only once die immediately. However, there's a scene where the Pakistanis overrun the Indian trenches and some very brutal hand-to-hand fighting occurs, and that is reasonably well done--much better than the rest of the "action" was.All in all, it's a clumsy and badly written (and edited, and acted, and scored) mixture of Hindu nationalism, Indian jingoism, stupidly phony heroics and wildly out-of-place musical numbers. If this is an example of the best that "Bollywood" has to offer, as some reviewers here seem to think, then thanks but no thanks." 
" A deep story and survey of war","J.P Dutta's brother fought and was martyred in war. He knows and has experienced what he is talking about, the pain that the soldiers' families feel when war is fought. The Indian army and soldiers' stereotypes abound in this movie. Indian soldiers are brave, moral, and fiercely patriotic. The two soldier, Dharam Veer (Akshay)and Mathura Das who doubts this in the beginning are later brought on to the patriotic side before the war is fought. Jackie Shroff, the airbase commander, anxiously waits so he can relieve his brethren. These shots, are very deep and not overdone. It is just symbolic of the deep relationships that are built in this movie. The antiwar message and Indo-Pak friendship message is spoiled a bit by the bravery, heroism of the Indian soldiers and villanizing of the Pakistanis. But I am so glad that he puts it in there. Mere Dushmaan Mere Bhai is a great way to end the movie. The acting in this movie, at least by the men, is superb. Pooja Bhatt excels and leaves an impression even though she is in only briefly. The songs of this movie add a lot to the movie. Sandese Aate Hain is especially touching." 
" described the battle of Longewala & valor of Major Kuldeep Singh & his men so well.","120 men without artillery or air support standing against a full regiment of 3000 men equipped with 40 tanks and yet they won the war with just 2 casualties.
the movie surely glorified the Indian army and proved our mettle."
