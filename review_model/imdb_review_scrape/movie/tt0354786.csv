" Not Bad","Rented out this DVD thinking that its a comedy movie. Though a complete U-turn from comedy, still a good attempt as a first time direction by Deepak Tijori (remember....Friend of Akshay Kumar in Khiladi).Movie is about 3 friends. A rich guy, a poor guy and a girl friend. The poor guy wants to be rich super fast, so becomes a male striptease against his friends wishes. He discovers a disturbing fact while in this profession. I will not reveal the disturbing fact. So watch out for yourself.Acting is not very great but manageable, songs are also strictly OK. The theme of the movie is what makes it different."
