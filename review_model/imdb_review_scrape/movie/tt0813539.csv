" The all-rounder again surpasses his previously ordained acme......kudos :bow:","Through the film ,Dev sahab brings to light several serious issues. A perfect rags to riches story.Based in earthquake-ravaged Kutch the movie shows what man can achieve if he applies his mind to betterment of the morally sickened society he is a part of. The grief stricken villager Johny Master an outspoken person is elected thanks to the villagers desiring a new era in the politics. Dev sahab is elegant in his role as Prem Batra the 3rd richest Indian in U K and then wages a war against the corruption in the erstwhile noble world of politics. Mr Prime Minister is a treatise on cleansed politics and a sparkling society in general ,the ever green maestro turns in yet another sterling performance that accentuates his script akin to the strobe lights in clubs."
