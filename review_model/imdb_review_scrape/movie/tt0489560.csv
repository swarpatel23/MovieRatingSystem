" One of the Dumbest movie ever, not so bad","This movie is total nonsense. But sometimes total nonsense works. All the characters are acting so dumb that I wonder at the end all will say, hey it was all a plot to fool the hero.Plot outline is this. Ashish (Akshayee Khanna) from doing window cleaning, selling malish on road became creative director in ad agency earning multi millions so that his sweethearts(Ayesha Takia) father agrees to give his daughter.After engagement, he overhears his doctor on phone mentioning that his young patient has cancer. And so he tries all bad things so that his fianc√©e hates him, including an affair with a model Sonia (Mallika Sherawat). Anyway Sonia has a brother Anna(Sunil Shetty) who lives in Malaysia and is a big don. Anna's pet dialogue is "Anna, Choubish ghanta chakanna" (Anna is alert all 24 hours).Now Ashish can't escape the clutches of Anna even if he wants to get back to Ayesha. The movie is so stupid that you just relax. Somehow, this feels better than forced comedy like "malamal weekly". Akshayee Khanna does a great job here as usual. He is one of the most natural actors and comedy suits him well. Surprisingly Mallika does a good job. Sunil Shetty(Anna) had a good time too." 
" Corny comedy","Well, I may be wrong, but I thought this movie was throughout trying to make spoofs of films like Kal Ho Naa Ho and Bollywood in general. It was good at times with some really funny parts. For example, Suniel Shetty's character was especially hilarious as it brought out the emotional side of a big mafia don. However, as the movie progressed, the spoofs became less evident, and Shadi Se Pehle just turned into the movie it was spoofing in the first place. Songs were good. Everyone--Aftab, Ayesha, Mallika, Suniel, and Akshaye--gave awesome, hilarious performances! Plus, the young, vivacious cast added freshness to the film. Comedy is not top-of-the-line, but all in all, Shadi Se Pehle is a decent time-pass." 
" Total letdown!!! The teasers are funnier.","Guy likes girl, guy is terminally ill, guy wants to save girl from getting hurt so guy makes girl hate him so she can forget him and he can die in peace.Sound familiar???? No s#$%. This line can be used to describe a large number of movie in the past the most recent being Bluffmaster. Only in this case we know from the beginning that he is not actually dying.Well with reference to the above its safe to say that one cannot have any expectations from this movie. All one can expect it a run of the mill slapstick comedy with over the top humour and funny one liners and hugely over-exaggerated characters.Not that thats bad we Indian feast on such comedies. We love to leave all our sensibilities at home and forget all the plot inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies of the film and just have laugh.But this movie is just to bad. Bad enough that they have to rely on jokes we cracked as kids and received as sms's on the phone. PATHETIC!! The acting is not really bad its of the same quality you would expect in any such slapstick comedy only problem is that the jokes are really so pathetic and the timing so bad that its difficult to laugh. Special mention for Rajpal Yadav who gets credit for being as if not more annoying then Johny Lever in less that 10 films hot on his trail is Boman Irani who of he continues these roles will no doubt catch up with him.Anupam Kher must have been really broke to have accepted the role in this film.They only saving grace of this film is Mallika Sherawat who plays the sexy sultry seductress to the hilt and carry the entire film on her shoulders with some help from Akshaye Khanna who deserved much better than this. The only few genuinely funny scenes in this movie all involve Mallika or akshaye with one particular scene being the one at the funeral.Also i don't know Ayesha takia was hardly given any comic sequences when will Indian filmmakers realise that women (besides the seductress) can be funny tooo.The songs save for one are all forgettable and i doubt the one that is OK will leave its mark too.All in all a totally avoidable movie the only funny scenes are almost all in the teasers. Definitely not worth watching but if it coming on TV and you nothing better to do don't change the channel you may end up seeing a few funny scenes." 
" Luca Bad!... Luca Mad!... Luca NOT Ugly!!!","I like Akshay Khanna. Thas was the only reason i decided to watch this film and i'm happy i did. "Shaadi Se Pehle" was a very pleasant surprise, and i usually don't like these kind of mindless comedy's. But the story is pretty original and unoriginal at the same time. A couple of jokes in the film are really hilarious, almost as if the great, late Mehmood himself wrote the script.Akshay Khanna is very good as usual. Although the wig he's wearing makes him look a little gay. Sunil Shetty is really a comedy actor, he should lay of the action flicks altogether. The two female leads look very pretty and do a OK job. Aftaab Shivdasani's acting was below average. I loved the special appearance by Gulshan Grover, him doing kind of a parody of his earlier "bad man"-character, though i'm not so sure if it was intentional or not.The songs are time-pass only. They should have cut of at least two of the songs and make the film a little shorter.7/10.. After Malamaal Weekly, this is the best Hindi comedy of the year so far!" 
" its not a bad movie","i am wondering why people saying this movie is really awful but its notthis movie is decent for 100 percent sure good comedy good songs and a perfect story and screenplayediting is fine akshaye khanna is excellent as the main protagonist sunil is good aft-ab is fine ayes-ha did well Malacca was the show steal-er for sure boman is fine gulshan is funny rajpal is funny anupam is hilarious my rating 7/10 above average if your a akshaye khanna fan go watch it" 
" It's movies like these that make us realize...","Bollywood sucks the big one. It's like a malfunctioning machine that keeps spitting out these ridiculous musical romantic comedies, that always end the same way, have generally the same plot, same characters, and same music. They're not original, or brilliant in anyway whatsoever. It's like they don't realize it's bad and they keep wasting money on the same crap. Of course it does appeal to Indians, because these are their films, but I mean can't you at least come up with something better. I mean Bollywood comes out with more movies than Hollywood every year, and they seem to only generally get attention in India, and even in India, International films seem to be more popular than their own (judging by their box office results)I am not a racist in any way whatsoever, in fact I have at least 7 friends who were born in India and came to America during their childhood. I am just a harsh critic, and I certainly hope some writer, or producer finds this and realizes that a change is in need, and not all films have to be musical comedies where a girl and guy serenade each other throughout the film. THERE IS OTHER MATERIAL OUT THERE AND India IS A VERY INSPIRATIONAL COUNTRY!" 
" SHAADI SE PEHLE A disaster imagine SHAADI KE BAD","Well well well Satish Kaushik is one of the funniest actors on Hindi screen at least in some films he was damn hilarious though he got annoying later-onAs a director he made social dramas like HUM AAPKE DIL MEIN REHTE HAI The recent hit TERE NAAM and some good films Comedy is considered one of his liabilities in his directed films be it HUM AAPKE DIL MEIN REHTE HAI and HAMARA DIL AAPKE PAAS HAI In TERE NAAM it was good but in this film he tries to make a complete comedy and ends up making a poor cousin of David DHAWAN filmsThe film starts quite well but suddenly becomes a sad caricatured over the top bullshit comedyIn short, Imagine a plot less film with comedy so forced and childish that it makes Govinda films classics?Imagine a film where Akshaye Khanna is hamming like a clown??????? Imagine a film where he wears the worst co loured clothes which make Govinda's clothes a style statement? Imagine a film where Aftab just comes and goes and you forget him? Imagine a film where Malika and Ayesha get to your nerves with their too bold and fake attitude and simple roles and fake acting respectively?Imagine a film where actors think making funny faces is being funny?Some funny one- liners can make a good comedy?????Overall a disaster barring some Suneil Shetty portions and his few lines the film is unbearable Suneil does manage to make you laugh with his Bhaigiri but that isn't much" 
" Painful!","I didn't expect much from the film, but the least I expected was something that would at least crack me up. Unfortunately, this film was excruciatingly painful to sit through. I expected much more from Akshaye Khanna. While he was borderline watchable, I suspect Mallika, on the other hand, was only there as eye candy, because she was really bad in the film. Some lines in the film were so lame, you had to laugh to relieve the pain of the rest of the film. On overall, not quite as funny as promoted, a lot more painful than advertised. Suniel Shetty brightened up the screen when he was on-screen, but again, this film was really terrible generally that not even the bright star of Shetty can save it. Painful. Very painful, indeed. If you feel like a night of a senses-dulling movie, then Shaadi Se Pehle is for you. If not, then I suggest you stay far away from this film. Word of advice for the brave: make sure you're really wasted before you attempt to sit through this movie."
