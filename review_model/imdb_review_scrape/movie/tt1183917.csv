" Patti Review","I beg to differ from the negative reviews. It may be a copy of 21. But I kept an open mind when I watched it. Yes, even though its a copy the actors were really good. The debut artists particularly were awesome. How can you not give them the credits for acting so good?? Yes I guessed the ending way before, but it does not take away the fact that the acting was superb and I personally enjoyed the movie. Good movie with a good underlying message to it. I don't know why people would give bad ratings to this movie...there are many cheap comedy flicks which pass the box office with positive reviews and higher ratings. If you are into serious movies, not expecting slapstick comedy...then yes this movie can be for you...Give it a try with an open mind." 
" Its not about what cards you are holding, but its all about how you play them in a game.","The title of the movie is "Teen Patti" which is the Indian famous name for the card game of Flash. And if you really know the game and also happen to be a great player of the same then the movie is simply not going to win its game against you. In few words it can only partly impress the people, who know nothing about the game and are there in the theater only for watching just another new release on a routine Friday.Frankly speaking, If you are making a movie on Card Gambling and also naming it with a title such as "Teen Patti" then you simply ought to know about the finer details of the game and its thrilling moments. But after watching the flick it seems that the director Leena Yadav knows nothing about the game in details and has made her second movie only around an inspired idea from the West. In fact all the writer-director knows about the game is a blind, three aces and numerous trails which come so easily in the game as if someone is setting the cards for the main players.Moreover, all the thrill, excitement and skills involved in the game can be found no-where in the movie, which in turn takes away all the charm associated with its tempting title. Written around the character of a Math's Professor who is working on a perfect theory of Probability, the movie takes the viewer as granted and explains nothing in technical terms about his unique achievement. The director is simply not interested in telling the viewer that how the professor and his team are operating on the gambling tables and winning continuously. In reality, whether the makers accept it or not, the project takes majority of its content from Hollywood's "21" released in 2008 featuring Kevin Spacey in the lead role of a professor. But Leena Yadav unimpressive handling of the project is quite timid in comparison with its western original."Teen Patti" starts off with a foreign sequence featuring both Amitabh Bachchan and Sir Ben Kingsley in the same frame. From there on the movie is entirely narrated in flashbacks where Amitabh is sharing his past year's experiences with Ben. It was quite surprising to see the way Ben was introduced to the audiences and also the strange kind of dialogues filmed on him, dubbed in the voice of Boman Irani. No doubt Ben looks great on the screen and excels in his short cameo, but was his inclusion in the movie required at all in the first place. Any other English actor could have easily done the job as it was not that important for the movie. But the makers called him in only to increase the face value of their project and nothing else. In straight words, Sir Ben Kingsley is simply wasted in the movie and the director simply misses the great opportunity she was given to work with.However, there are few entertaining moments in "Teen Patti" which keep you engrossed at regular intervals, but they all are too scattered to give you a lasting impression. Like the scenes in the local gambling dens in the first half and the sequence where Amitabh challenges the Black-mailer while holding the money bag in his hands. The later one is unarguably the best scene of the movie. Apart from these the most enjoyable moment of "Teen Patti" is when you have Mr. Mahesh Manjrekar on the screen in full spirits as a local Bhai. He thoroughly entertains you in a short cameo with his funny facial expressions, an authentic body language and hilarious "Tapori" lingo. All the other special appearances by Jackie Shroff, Tinnu Anand, Shakti Kapoor and Ajay Devgan are strictly OK.Cinematography proves as an asset of the movie with many well conceived sequences of gambling dens and their prefect visuals. Salim Suleiman and Ashley Lobo both have done a good job in the only song of the movie "Teri Neeyat Kharaab Hai". Interestingly at one end the director is intelligent enough to us only one song in the movie and avoids any unwanted elaborate love angle in the storyline. But on the other hand she is so confusing in her execution and completely lost in the writing department of her big project. For instance in the whole movie you keep wondering what kind of professor is Madhavan teaching in the same college, dressed just like the other students and Why on earth Amitabh and his team takes a beautiful girl along with them to the risky gambling dens in the get up of a prostitute? (Where she doesn't even contribute anything in the game.) Amitabh Bachchan as the genius professor performs his role efficiently with few glimpses of the professor from "Black" in some particular scenes. Yet at certain places I found him doing it with a greater spirit and force than actually required. His speech in the climax also fails to catch your attention in absence of any well written and appreciable lines. Madhavan looks confused along with the writers as they never care to tell us what specific subject he teaches in the college and what kind of debt he is in. The four new talents introduced in the movie perform with the right confidence and excel. Especially Shraddha Kapoor and Dhruv stand out of the lot as they also get the maximum exposure on the screen. Raima Sen is passable but Barry John is truly excellent in his few scenes.In short, "Teen Patti" fails to provide the much needed thrill and excitement associated with its title. In gambling language, director Lena Yadav holds nothing in her hands in the name of cards but tries to play a bluff with the big names of Amitabh Bachchan and Ben Kingsley. Amusingly I felt a strong urge of seeing Dev Anand's "Gambler" once again, after watching this weak interpretation of the game." 
" 21 meets Amitabh Bacchan in the most disastrous way possible","There is only one word for this movie BAD in capital.I have never been a great fan of Big B but some of his performances have been remarkable. this was not one of them.Sir Ben Kingsley Seems to have been cast just for the sake of getting a great name from Hollywood across to bollywood. His acting talents were very poorly utilized and i agree with BOBBYSIN "Sir Ben Kingsley is simply wasted in the movie and the director simply misses the great opportunity she was given to work with." The Newcomers did a better Job then the seniors in this movie.Madhavan- my god what a silly look they gave him for a professor. it looked like instead of being a professor in the college he was some guy at the counter of the college canteens. his performance was mediocre. It seemed he was overwhelmed by the thought of working with Sir Ben Kingsley though he had only one scene with him at the end of the movie.Watching the movie i got bored and just wanted to leave. almost dosed off till i heard a child cry in the Hall.It seemed as if the writers and the director tried Taking Amitabh Bachchan and create and Indian version of Kevin Spacey In 21 but ended up with Russel Crowe from A beautiful Mind. Some might find it bizarre but that's what the end of the movie was like according to me. I would advice people that are thinking of going and watching this movie that change your plans, Pick something else." 
" A good hand makes all the difference...","My expectations were already rock-bottom after watching Leena Yadav's "Shabd". When Amitabh Bachchan, Hinduja's, Ben Kingsley and Madhavan have agreed to participate I thought Leena Yadav has a winner in her hands which will not only wash away her sins but also catapult like a phoenix. Big B's character is too idealistic to relate. Shades of grey like in "Kaante" would have added sheen to the role of Venkat Subramanian. And he was looking quite old actually and his disenchantment showed.Ben Kingsley was completely wasted. Edit his role completely and even a fly wouldn't budge. Incorporating him into the movie just fuelled marketing of bad apples.Raima Sen hardly had meat in her character. Shraddha Kapoor seems promising and has a good screen presence.Ajay Devgun, Jackie Shroff, Mahesh Manjrekar, Shakti Kapoor, Tinnu Kapoor & Ranjeet gave the blast from the past 1980's feeling. What were Mita Vashist & Shivkumar Subramaniam were actually doing?There are too many unnecessary characters and unwanted layers in the movie. Even the ode to "Bonnie & Clyde" was out of sync. Keeping the blackmailer in the hoods was not ably handled (Whodunnit? Audience couldn't care any less actually).Already the movie was facing the plagiarism threat from 21, so anything more it sank it deeper.The ending was so 1980's, melodramatic & Bollywood'ish." 
" Awful","15-20 people in the theatre again. Another flop. Teen Patti starts off OK. Amitabh Bacchan explains probability and some how manages to predict which hand will in a game of Teen Patti. Then, it starts to fade away with sequences which offer nothing of interest one after the other.As the movie progresses, it becomes more pointless. It is disjointed and badly edited which gets poorer by the second. It becomes a movie which says greed is bad and shows how relationships break down, student commits suicide in stress and keeps ramming the fact that trying to earn money by this method is dirty. Then there is the supposed main plot of the movie where they are trying to find out the mysterious blackmailer which pops up every twenty minutes only to disappear.And I haven't come to Ben Kingsley-Amitabh Bacchan scenes. First of all all we know is Ben Kingsley is a rich man, probably owner of a casino. And every 40 minutes there is a scene between the two mulling about life and giving away philosophies which are drab. Worst of all, they are dubbed in Hindi which is ****ing ridiculous. Makes the dialogues seem even more pointless, if that's possible.And the acting by the actors including Amitabh Bachchan is very ordinary. I give the movie a 0.5/10 and that's only because I like two songs in the movie." 
" Absolute crap and a waste of talent","What was Ben Kingsley doing in this poorly directed wreck of a movie?" 
" Brilliant performances but a cheap lift of 21's script","Who would've thought Bollywood producers would dare to experiment with a script on Mathematical Probablity equations!!! But, here we go - Amitabh Bachchan as Professor Venkat Subramaniam is a reclusive Math teacher in a college where no one really appreciates his ideas because of his eccentric ways. Silently buried in research for 30 years something, Venkat suddenly hits upon a blockbuster theory, something that should forever change the course of mathematics. According to the director, probably the last person to make similar impact in the field of Mathematics was Sir Issac Newton when he saw the apple fall from a tree. As a symbolism, the professor is shown receiving the Cambridge University's Issac Newton nomination before the credits roll.So far, so good. But, I lost interest in the film as soon as it was clearly evident that a lot of scenes had been straight lifted from Kevin Spacey starring "21". From a Jim Sturgess character who's facing a huge debt and must somehow find a way out (Madhavan's character), to a genius Mathematics professor who hits upon a brainwave idea in "Teen Patti"; in the English version it was Blackjack. Throw in scenes of gambling dens, underworld criminals and you get the complete picture. I was able to predict climax scenes too, such as the identity of the blackmailer.I was expecting to see more out of Ben Kingsley but his character was simply mired in some sort of mystique without backing it up with background or foundation. But, the bigger disappointment was this blatant script plagiarism. That alone should make me rate it 2 stars or less." 
" Amitabh's magic yet again!","Watched 'Teen Patti' which was on my must-see list for a pretty long time. Its definitely another one of Amitabh's magic. Wonder how all the story lines he has worked upon in his second innings are so splendid. And, every time I get this amazing feeling of watching a real-life character in whatever role he performs. He excels in-spite of negative portrayal and clumsy make-up with the help of his eyes and voice that are damn expressive! He is definitely an icon from whom all the actors who are aging up must learn to choose roles from. The other actors in the movie have given a neat performance as well. If you are a type who likes suspense movies that make sense and also convey a message, go for it." 
" Watching because of shrdada","Wow shrdada first film...cute acting by her....
After this she became best actress..." 
" Slow, dark and poorly directed","This movie is a waste of excellent actors. Movie starts out OK but story and direction are poor. Use of poor lighting is likely deliberate but makes the whole movie feel even slower and shadier. It starts out OK with hopes raised due to a different subject from the usual good vs evil struggle. There is even an attempt to develop different characters and make some of them edgier with the addition of drugs, debts etc. But the movie starts drifting soon - like a boat without a captain on waves. Screenplay and direction are two key weak points. There is almost nothing to mitigate the poor direction. Even top notch actors are unable to rescue the movie." 
" Decent subject but could be better","Leena Yadav got criticised badly with her first film Shabd which was a flop, she made a comeback with TEEN PATTI which was a launch of Shraddha Kapoor, Siddharth Kher and some more, it brought together Amitabh Bachchan with Ben Kingsley,alongwith Madhavan. The film is a remake of 21 which starred Ben Kingsley himself The film had an interesting premise but the execution doesn't work entirely,it has some fleeting cameos, a few necessary but some forced like Ajay Devgans The film has interesting twists and turns, onlything it gets slow paced and also at times it's difficult to understand But yet it is a decent filmDirection by Leena Yadav is decent Music is good, Neeyat Kharab Hai being the bestAmitabh Bachchan is simply outstanding, no other actor could play it better, Ben Kingsley is royally wasted in an inconsequential role, Madhavan is terrific in his role, Newcomers Siddharth Kher is good, Shradda Kapoor was pretty ordinary, Dhruv Ganesh is superb as Bikram, Vaibhav is okay, Ajay Devgan has one scene,Mahesh Manjerekar is fab in one scene, Shakti Kapoor makes a cameo, interestingly he plays a gambler who has a betting habit, and speaks bad language next to his daughter. Anjan Shrivastav and others are okay" 
" False advertising","Having immense potential, this film unfortunately turns out to be strictly average. The whole movie is about a group of students and teachers that get trapped in an underworld gambling ring. The movie was promoted showing how mathematics can be utilized to manipulate games, deduce card dealings, and accurately predict hands. While these do occur, absolutely no details regarding the formula, its discovery, its teachings, etc. are given. There's just all this hoopla of a probability theory with nonsensical numbers and equations constantly being written in the air, and the audience is just supposed to blindly trust what Amitabh is saying without even getting an opportunity to understand it. Another part of the false advertising was that it is supposed to be a very slick, stylish, thriller, which it was not. Songs were good, but character development was poor. The final monologue by Amitabh is some sort of a saving grace, but a little too late." 
" Probably the most painful movie I have ever seen","Teen Patti is a complete disaster. There is no coherence and most of the scenes were just shot without having any context and meaning. There were some characters (Bikram's roommate, Ben Kingsley) who didn't have any reason to be part of this movie.The basic theme of the movie itself is technically flawed. Teen Patti is a game where maths cannot play any role in increasing your winning probability to more than 50% as opposed to Black Jack where card counting can increase your winning probability to more than 50%.The director didn't trust the intelligence of the audience enough to find it necessary to explain Professor Venkat's game strategy. There so many loose ends in the movie for which no explanation was offered as to the how's and why's behind Sid's money being stolen (the red bag of money) and placed in Bikram's room. The kidnap plot was very comical.I would rate 'Neal n Nikki', 'Home Delivery', 'Kisna' much better than this movie :)" 
" See "21" instead.",""Teen Patti" surprised me. After all, it stars Amitabh Bachchan and he's my favorite Indian actor....to I expected to enjoy the film. Instead, I only felt disappointment...and a bit annoyed. It should have been better...much, much better.The story is a reworking of the American film, "21", but with enough differences to say it's not a remake. Unfortunately, all the new things they added to the mix just took an excellent idea and made it much, much worse. Annoying and unlikable characters, songs that just did not fit the story, plot elements that were unnecessary...all these made the original idea muddled.Bachchan plays a mathematics professor who's been lecturing on probability. He's come to realize that using statistics and probability, he COULD make a huge killing by using a team of gamblers. And, initially, the plan nearly gets them killed, as the underground gambling dens seem frequented by psychotic thugs. But they cannot quit, as SOME unknown person knows about their scheme and has threatened to harm the college students helping the professor unless they keep playing and giving this unknown person a cut. In the film they called this blackmail but the correct term for forcing someone to do something or you will harm them is actually extortion...but no matter. What's next? Well, lots of over the top drama and a story that left me wanting the whole thing to end.The bottom line is that there was a kernal of a good story but way too many distractions along the way to interfere with the plot. Take my advice....see "21" instead...it's intelligent and free from all the unnecessary and annoying things in "Teen Patti"." 
" Was this supposed to make any sense at all?","This is one of the most senseless movies that I have ever come across. Most of the scenes just come and go by and you are left to wonder why were they included in the first place. There are many cameos in the movie but again no point of them. Here are my problems with this awful flick1) No character depth. None of the students seemed to have any parents to control their activities in the hostel. The students seemed to be least concerned about their safety and studies. By the way, was it actually an engineering college? Lol! 2) Shraddha's character is so badly written. That she is an Indian girl who might have some inhibitions before visiting these underground places in skimpy clothes is something that the director seems to have completely overlooked. And, anyway, why was she required in the gambling dens? Just to divert others attention towards something else so that her accomplices can carry on with their sign language safely? I mean how dumb is that! 3) When her character is molested or perhaps raped, then she doesn't seem to be too perturbed. neither did Amitabh's character show any sympathy towards her. And when that skinny guy committed suicide at the end, everything ended! I mean a girl's rape/molestation doesn't count for anything? 4) Anybody who has played Flash or who has studied probability will tell you that no matter how much you research it is impossible to do what Amitabh's character was shown doing in the movie. Does the director think we are all illiterate fools who would believe just anything? 5) Why was everybody so scared of being followed or being tracked? Is visiting gambling dens and winning some cash there so dangerous that everyone at once will start following you? Also, why did Abbas have to ask these group of dumbos to visit posh clubs? Don't they have any sense in their mind? I mean just because he is rich, only he can go to these high society clubs? 6) Why did Abbas get involved in the mess? To seek thrills? I mean come on, get a life! The only way to seek thrills is by attending these clubs and playing cards? You are loaded man, you have options galore!!! 7) What was up with that foreigner who seemed to be interested in Madhavan? In fact what was up with Tinu Anand, Shakti Kapoor and Ajay Devgan? Why were these people included? To look dumb in a crappy flick? 8) Why did all these actors sign this movie? Doesn't Amitabh have any idea about which scripts are good and which suck? He has so much of experience and he is also talented but one look at his filmography (RGV Ki Aag, Alladin, Teen Patti, Boom, Baghban and so on) will be able to convince you that that he lacks some brains! 9) Is it so easy to be out frequently from your hostel and college without any one suspecting you? Did Amitabh and Madhavan did not have any conscience considering the things that they asked their students to do? By the way, was Madhavan a professor? I mean, seriously, was he a teacher in the 'college'? 10) Was Amitabh a genius? He was shown playing this stupid game on the computer, then he seemed to be under the impression that the only people who would accept his theories and thesis are his employers, he actually believed that things could be levitated just like that (actually what was that levitating trick? are we a bunch of dumba**es who would believe that?), he was able to be manipulated so easily......does someone become a genius by aping Einstein? Aaargh, if you are planning to watch this flick, plz don't do it, it would be a wastage of your time. Highly un-recommended!" 
" Terrible attempt to duplicate 21","Too bad.. That's it. Poor performance Poor Script Please watch movie 21. Try to understand the difference. I watched 21 and it's a great movie Now Bollywood is trying to copy, This is lack of creativity. I was so disappointed by watching this. Don't waste your time to watch this. It was quite surprising to see the way Ben was introduced to the audiences and also the strange kind of dialogues filmed on him, dubbed in the voice of Boman Irani. No doubt Ben looks great on the screen and excels in his short cameo, but was his inclusion in the movie required at all in the first place. Any other English actor could have easily done the job as it was not that important for the movie. But the makers called him in only to increase the face value of their project and nothing else. In straight words, Sir Ben Kingsley is simply wasted in the movie and the director simply misses the great opportunity she was given to work with."
