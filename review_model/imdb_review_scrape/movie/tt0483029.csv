" Why??????????????????????????????????????","This movie was given to me for free and five minutes into viewing it I could see why. The acting by the veterans (Rahul Dev & Smita Jaykar) was top-notch but what was the point in such a D-rate movie with such d-rated main characters working on a d-rate script? The storyline follows the decadent lives of six wayward teenagers(bear with me, the people playing these roles look well into their 30s but please suspend your disbelief) at a local college and the police officer(Dev) who comes into their lives when two of them are kidnapped and eventually murdered.It was a good enough plot gone awry, perhaps in the hands of a more capable director like Sanjay Gupta or Ram Gopal Va this film could have turned out to be the dark thriller they were going for."
