" A good movie to watch.","i loved the movie. i don't go with the ratings given by people.the movie is a soft heartencomedy along with few ups and downs of life. that's what we expect from,this kind of a entertainer.YOU'LL NOT GET BORED IF YOU LOVE TO WATCH MOVIES ON SOCIAL MOVIES.and yes as per the requirements of the IMDb website i have to fill at least ten lines to compile the standards.and i don't know what to say more. but yes the role play by the actors is really good enough to be watched.specially the role played by Mr. Ravi kishan was great." 
" Disappointingly Clichéd... Even The Cast Jogs Memories Of Yesteryear Flicks. ♦ 39%","Throughout the movie, you get a feeling that you have watched that sequence, that character, that plot point and heard that joke, that song, that theme before. Well, it's not deja vu. Bajatey Raho rests upon clichéd plot, borrowed characters, irritatingly predictable climax & amateur writing.The cast has been a juxtaposition of characters as well as the actors who portrayed them in films like Khosla Ka Ghosla. And so is the plot. The same old revenge tale to induce little melodrama to do what to the viewers? Well, I can't figure that clause out. Neither could I interpret why they HAD to bring in romance (with songs, yes) & SMS jokes (Maybe to lure lovebirds & youngsters; of course we all know what the two-girl item song was intended for). It's all so amateur from the maker(s) who gave us Dasvidaniya. Challo Dilli was a disappointment, as well.I respect the performances by Dolly Ahluwalia, Ravi Kishan, Ranvir Shorey & Vinay Phatak. But I, somehow, got bored by the narration. My mother seconds that. Since, I have followed every other movie by every other actor of this flick, it left me neutral. 3.9/10!"Gone there, seen that!" is the apt phrase that comes to my mind now. Although, it has its moments.BOTTOM LINE: For people who haven't watched the movies that listed & are socially inept can go for it and have some laughs on borrowed humor, but for avid cinema-holics, this is not recommended.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: Very Mild | Nudity/Vulgarity/Sex/Mouth-Kiss: No | Violence/Gore: No | Drugs: No | Smoking/Alcohol: Mild" 
" Decent Watch","When you have ensembled cast of Dolly Ahluwalia , Ranvir Shorey and Vinay Pathak , your joy will know no bound and the excitement will double. Unfortunately , Bajatey Raho comes as a plain simple decent revenge heist which could be watched only once for its strong storyline and decent performances.In order to repay 15 cr to the debtors , group of cons goes one step further to con a powerful business man to avenge their family's misfortune. From the director of Dasvidaniya and Challo Dilli , Shashant Shah chooses a rare subject which has universal appeal but average direction and below par performance takes the film to no where. The screenplay and story will hold your attention nevertheless. Few scenes will tickle your funny bones but the rest of the film is lame. Songs are terrible and inclusion of the songs in the film just makes it worst. Dolly Ahluwali and Ravi Kishan are the soul of the movie. Tushar Kapoor as usual is wooden. Surprisingly , much was expected from Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey but both of them gave an average performances.Bajatey Raho had potential to become non-stop comic caper but weak direction drags down the film to a decent watch . Average 2.5/5" 
" Has Its Moments!","Shashant A Shah's 'Bajatey Raho' is a passable revenge-comedy, that has its share of moments. Even the performances, are noteworthy!'Bajatey Raho' Synopsis: Surviving family members and friends of a man who was conned by the cunning businessman Sabbarwahl string together a series of their own cons in an attempt to bring him down.'Bajatey Raho' has a slow-paced first-hour, but an entertaining second. The characters are decently written & the sequences, some of them, are worth appreciating. Zafar A Khan's Screenplay begins on a slow-note, but gathers momentum in the latter-hour. Shashant A Shah's Direction is ordinary. Cinematography, Editing & Costume Design, are alright.Performance-Wise: Ravi Kishan is in terrific form. He plays the cunning businessman with energy & conviction. Dolly Ahluwalia is natural to the core. Ranvir Shorey & Vinay Pathak are effortless, as always. Tusshar does not deliver this time. Vishakha Singh looks charming & delivers a truly commendable performance. Brijendra Kala is very sincere.On the whole, 'Bajatey Raho' offers fair entertainment." 
" not a bad con film","A highly entertaining punjabi tadka type of comedy, with a hint of thrill. Acting wise Ranvir Shorey and Brijinder Kala standout whenever both are on screen its a laugh riot. Tusshar Kapoor, Dolly Ahluwali, and Ravi Kissen excel also. Vinay Pathak, and Vikeshaka Singh give good support also. Dir Sushant Singh gives a hat trick of good films, after dasvidaniya and challo dilli, Bajatey Raho also impress, hats off!!! The films story is about a mother son and his two friends conning corrupt people to pay off there debt. Overall if you want to be entertained for 2 hrs, if you want watch a good comedy, with good acting, good music and a hint of thrill Bajaety Raho is a safe bet." 
" The second half rescues this poor clone of KHOSLA KA GHOSLA but only to some extent.","Projected as a laugh riot in its promotional campaign, BAJATEY RAHO is actually a revenge con drama trying too hard to entertain the viewer with its not so hilarious sequences. The film has a star-cast promising you an enjoyable ride but the not so happening script never lets them perform to the best of their ability except in the final half an hour. As a result, till the story progression gains it desired momentum, it becomes too late for this comparatively short duration film of only 107 minutes and the viewer largely remains unsatisfied while moving out.Taking a wild guess on the basic idea behind this film, it seems that the makers wished to make something on the lines of KHOSLA KA GHOSLA along with the references of the big surprise hit VICKY DONOR. So working on this exciting idea, they first got a script written, mostly inspired from the plot of KKG wherein a huge sum needs to be stolen back from a cunning businessman and roped in Vinay Pathak, Ranveer Shorey & Rajender Sethi, the three men playing key roles in the same movie. Now further taking a clue from the recent success of VD, they bring in Dolly Alhuwalia & even Kamlesh Gill to woo the audience. And then to make it a more commercial viable product, they get Tusshar Kapoor (as the hero), Ravi Kishan (as the villain) & Vishakha Singh to play the forced in romantic lead which was not required at all. So in my opinion, this must have been the thought process behind the making of this poor clone of KHOSLA KA GHOSLA as it seems.Following the above mentioned vision, the director tries to retain the same Punjabi feel, placing his characters in the good old Delhi, one of the most favourite city of Bollywood directors in the last few years. Moreover the dialogues are all written with a typical Punjabi touch, which completely fails to generate even half of what we all enjoyed a lot in both KKG and VD. Beginning with an unimpressive sting operation scene in a school, its first hour is a big drag with nothing great happening on the screen despite the presence of some exceptionally talented actors. The director is unable to extract a good comedy from his performers due to an unexciting writing and the film truly disappoints before the interval.Thankfully the scenario takes a major turn post intermission as the progression gains momentum and it all gets on the right path with everyone joining in for a big fat marriage. The smiles are back after a fine Jagran sequence (reminding you the one seen in FUKREY) having a great parody song, "Tainu Main Love Karda" (Mata Di Bhent) written brilliantly, based on the famous DESI BOYZ party track. Later there is another catchy number "Main Nagin Dance Nachna" which should do well in the discos and parties all over north India. Coming to its conclusion fast, the film ends on a hurried note and the final 30-40 minutes, luckily save this weak attempt from the director Shashant Shah, post his appreciable DASVIDANIYA (2008) and CHALO DILLI (2011).BAJATEY RAHO fails to make an instant connect with the viewer mainly due to its slow and non-hilarious script which tries desperately to bring in that desired humor in vain. Its major attraction i.e. the star-cast mostly remains underutilized with actors like Vinay, Ranveer and Tusshar simply doing nothing substantial on the screen unexpectedly. Ravi Kishan and Vishakha act fine but the romantic angle between Vishakha and Tushhar was entirely out of sync. In the remaining cast Rajender Sethi(the TV Star's father), Rajinder Nanu (Raman), Vikas Mohla (pawan), Anya Singh (Gudiya), Nikhil Pandey (as the TV Star) and Husaan Saad (the Kid) provide their much needed support in the events, particularly in the last hour. But it was quite surprising to see Kamlesh Gill (the famous Dadi of VD) being wasted only in 2-3 scenes.Cinematography gives the film its much required look or feel and Background Score tries to create the impact of a hit comedy with much effort. But when in a Hindi film, actors try to speak Punjabi in a faulty way then it really ruins the build-up and questions the direction as well as the writing in a big way. Yet BAJATEY RAHO can be seen once for its two good songs, a few entertaining scenes of Dolly Ahluwalia and a truthful performance of Brijendra Kala playing the ignored personal secretary superbly. It has a better second half which largely saves the film, turning it into an average entertainer in the end, quite safely. Still films like BAJATEY RAHO (which could have been much more with such a cast ensemble) mostly enjoy a better run in the home video market than in the theaters." 
" Waste of an Ensemble cast","Bajatey Raho promises so much and delivers so less. If you have actors like Vinay Pathak, Ranbir Shorey, Dolly Ahluwalia, Ravi Kishen in your movie, a simple story can transform into a power packed entertainment. Alas, the director made a point to assemble the aforesaid cast but choose a story which lacked originality.The movie seemed to be a tribute to Khosla ka Ghosla more than once. Then again, tributes are so tricky. The cons performed didn't excite much and the ending was so very predictable. Shashant Shah after directing classics like Dasvidaniya and Chalo Dilli with the sheer brilliance of one single actor named Vinay Pathak, forgot to utilize him for majority of the film. Tushar Kapoor has let down the audience on more than one instance and this movie is another example of the same. Ranbir Shorey and Dolly Ahluwalia showed some sparks in the limited opportunities they were presented with.Then again, if you want to watch this movie at all, watch it for Ravi Kishen. Just like wine, he is getting better with age. He demonstrated such a flawless spectrum of emotions that you can overlook the dullness of the story itself or at least in the parts he has acted in.Moral : Watch this movie in case you have watched Khosla ka Ghosla only more than a dozen times and you are finally bored of the same."
