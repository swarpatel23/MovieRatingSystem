" The most weirdly stupid movie","There is no imagination, or rather stupid imagination all through the movie. The amount of money thrown around is obscene...for the first time a bollywood movie talks in billions of Euros. The special effects are childish, the premise and the so called twists are crazy. Its all about being glamorous, the script proves that no brains have been applied. I cant think of enough bad adjectives for this movie. I couldn't avoid watching it, but do yourselves a favor and stay away from it. I was feeling embarrassed watching it, the makers should have been ashamed. Lets take one example of the multitude in this movie. a car is fitted with a bomb that would burst if the speed is reduced. So Saif removes it while the car is doing 100+, but lo and behold, the bomb has no wiring connected to anything in the car. its just stuck there, he pulls it and throws it away. So how would it have tripped if the speed was reduced? Just one of the hundreds of examples of asinine non logics in this movie. Stay AWAY!!" 
" setting new standards for dumbness in Bollywood","Race 2 (2013) IMDb- 5.4 RJG Rating- 05Sequel to the blockbuster hit Race ,follows Ranvir's latest plan for revenge.Starring- Saif Ali,John Abraham,Deepika ,Jacqueline Director- Abbas-MastanNone of the actors are of any good.The only thing Saif Ali Khan does is give out his "know it all" stare.John Abraham proves once again that he has no other talents than modeling.His only contributions to the movie are his various shirtless scenes.As a villain he is a big time fail.Anil Kapoor is another wasted talent.He and Amisha Patel dish out various fruit related (im not kidding,all their dialogs are fruit related!) puns.Although both Deepika and Jacq have some story related role ,they only score on the skin show department.Its easy to mistake the story for being written by an 8 year old who probably ate too much chocolate.Within 5 minutes from the start ,it starts getting beyond the realm of ridiculousness.Its so bad that i wanted to 'facepalm' myself permanently for watching the idiocy that unfolded on screen.Cheating poker ,speed based bomb,stealing historical items ,the list goes on,its all so idiotic that it starts getting hilarious in the second half.One of the best qualities of the first movie were its twists.With Race 2 ,the twists and turns can be seen a mile away.Its all too obvious and predictable.Almost all of them are shamelessly recycled from Hollywood.This movie is an insult to the human senses.Abbas-Mastan have either gone nuts or are just trying to make quick cash with their worthless movies.They fill the movie with stylish shots trying hard to cover up the dumb story.Even here they fail.The visual effects are very poor and seem to be a decade old technology.The overdose of stylish sequences drag the movie even more.The action sequences are too long and the comedy is very poor.The fruit related jokes are the most utterly lamest things I've ever heard in an action movie.Why fruits? Was it to support the cherry popping jokes? There's no other reason for fruit comedy in Race 2!! The only plus point that can be salvaged from Race 2 is its music.The music videos were interesting and helped to increase the movies tempo.Overall Race 2 is one of the worst movies I've seen in 2013.Stay away from it.The music videos can be seen on Youtube for free.Acting- 0/5 Story- 0/5 Direction- 0/5 Action- 1/5 Thriller- 1/5" 
" This movie is a JOKE!","Honestly, I was expecting something big, something spectacular but what was the turn out, Race II ladies and gentlemen, the biggest joke of 2013. If the makers took the time and revised and edited the script, maybe they could have created something good. The movie has many unnecessary songs which can get quiet frustrating. The special effects are garbage, they look like crap. Crappy explosions. A lot of it is clichéd. The fight scenes were okay but too bollywood-ish, not realistic. I wouldn't suggest watching this in theaters, don't waste you money, wait for the DVD release. I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 just for Deepika and John, everyone else was just okay." 
" Not even an inch closer to Race","Race 2 is a popcorn flick at best! Too much care has been taken for the oomph and style in the film but little has been done to enlighten the screenplay which was definitely a plus point of its predecessor, Race. Race 2 boosts of a stellar cast of A-list actors but the plot doesn't have the spell to stand above the rest. The first half moves sluggishly while the second half seems rushed. In the first edition of Race, the twists kept us hooked and interested, so in Race 2, we expected more and better twists. Director duo Abbas- Mustan do try (and desperately) to give us more than a handful, but keeping up with them is labourious.The hero in the film (Saif Ali Khan) is shown as an James Bond incarnate as he can do almost everything be it riding a speed boat, archery, fencing, gambling etc. John Abraham makes a sorry villain and since all his tricks are thwarted by Saif in this film, you feel that he has come across looking more dumber than being intelligent in the film. I wonder what went wrong with Deepika Padukone in Race 2? She shows only her skin and not her acting skills. Oops! But is that true for the other ladies in this movie too? Not really. Jacqueline Fernandez has a meatier role than Deepika's. Deepika wears a stone-faced expression on her face throughout and you wonder is that the same actress who gave a power packed performance in Cocktail? But it must be noted that Jacqueline too struggles with giving the appropriate expressions and she has minimal facial expressions. Anil Kapoor and Ameesha Patel compete to prove who comes across as sillier. Anil's PJs make you feel sick to the stomach. The music of the movie is also a minus point. Race 2 lacks an appealing chartbuster much like Abbas-Mustan's last year's disaster, Players! Race 2, with its twists and turns, is like one of those terrible roller- coaster rides that leave you nauseated and sick by the end." 
" Actually Awful movie...","Not sure , what happens to us to see this kind of movies does 100 Crore Rs. business... Totally Fake stunts (Especially I cried myself out watching last fight scene in plane..)... Copied music.. copied scenes (especially the theft scene copied from National Treasure 2)... I guess all we Indians want is good location and girls to make this movie hit... Creativity is totally lost in Indian Cinema... It's better to watch original Hollywood movie rather than disgraceful copied Bollywood out of it..... Eagerly waiting for one of Raj-Kumar Hirani movie to see something good and original.Its not race.. Its Disgrace.... !!!" 
" Race 2:A bad successor to to its predecessor Race!","Race 2 directed by Abbas-Mustan is a sheer disappointment.Except for some few exceptional performances and beautiful cinematography,nothing else works.Clichéd screenplay,lack of surprising twist and turns,addition of unwanted characters,slow-pacing and unwanted songs.The first half of the movie was a bit interesting,but the second half turns out to be more painful,thanks to the hackneyed writing.The twists and turns in the second half,is the same twist and turns we saw in its predecessor,Race! Even there are so many songs in the movie.After every 10-15 minutes of some action sequences or some laughable dialogs,there appears song.Story: Ranvir (Saif Ali Khan) treads through the world of the Indian mafia in Turkey as he looks to avenge the death of his lover and partner in crime.The direction is terrible.The writing is half-baked.The action sequences is average.The music is fairly okay."Allah Duhai Hai" is the best of all.The cinematography by Ravi Yadav is excellent.The scenic beauty of Cyprus and Istanbul has been captured very well and is a treat to the eye for the viewer.Performances:John Abraham's performance is the best of all.He acts the evil part with perfection.Saif Ali Khan is average.Anil Kapoor is good.Deepika Padukone looks gorgeous and acts well.Jacqueline Fernandez looks appealing but acts appalling! Ameesha Patel,Aditya Pancholi,Bipasha Basu and Rajesh Khattar are all wasted.All in all,Race 2 is bad successor to Race.I am giving it a three on ten.Colossal Disappointment!" 
" Race 2 = { ( Race 1 -minus- intelligent plot) + (Fashion Show) }","I wasn't expecting much from the director duo after "Players." But, since Race was a very good watch, I watched Race 2 and was disappointed.It starts with fabulous action sequences in great locations and as you try and perceive what it will be all about in the remaining 2 hours, a twist awaits you and the total number of twists we have here is colossal and that is why I gave it 5 stars. It is surely a thriller, I guarantee that. But too much of style and Bollywood punches ruined this broth.But, as a cinemaholic, I felt the plot was saggy, the performances by the cast wasn't up to the mark. Saif is cool, John is beast and lacks character depth, the lead girls act dumb and try VERY hard to be killers. Anil Kapoor has disappointed me the most with his not-so-witty jokes along with emcee voluptuous Amisha! And it also demands total attention or else, you will lose your way into this maze.Direction is sweet; the screenplay sucks and the story, which has to be a foundation of such high-octane flicks is feeble, fickle and sometimes even super-fly. Music is like... good - but the songs - film- makers were forced to slide them in.Race 2 is not a red-lounge-reclining seat movie, but looking at the 2013 releases, it is better than Matru but feebler than Table No. 21.Bottom Line: Some Race 2 sequences will make you whine and swear, but the rest MAY... I repeat, MAY make you happy. It is a type of movie where different people will have different verdicts. And my verdict is it is a preposterous caper where no only a couple of rich Indians run the town. It is like hue & saturation. You can go for it if you haven't anything to do this three- day weekend! It will entertain you to some extent, but if you are a serious cinema-goer (and critic) and aspire logic, Race 2 cannot be compared with its predecessor or with any action flick for that matter.Some pivotal plot points have been copied from Nicholas Cage starrer National Treasure & certain Hollywood spy movies.WATCH OUT FOR: Saif, explosions, ridiculous stunt scenes, numerous plot turns, expected ending, cheesy dialogues and a useless wrestling sequence.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: Clean | Sex: No | Foreplay: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Very Mild | Alcohol: Strong | Nudity: Medium | Smoking: No" 
" A pointless movie with nothing racy in it","Abbas-Mustan always believes in dashing looks, tough fights, engaging storytelling and nail biting climaxes. Well, it worked really well in Race I collecting 85.5 crores worldwide; unfortunately in Race II, although the casts are super cool and fight scenes are quite impressive but the movie lacks immensely on that engaging-story-part.! The movie starts with a bang and takes convoluted route with lots of twists and turns but a bit too slowly because of frequent and unnecessary songs; then in the middle the script looses its element of surprise and you get 'remake' scenes from Zorro I (sword fight where Saif magically redid the epic scene by Antonio Banderas but with 'blunted' swords!) and instead of a sequel you get an ill-advised rehash. The good 'bad-guy' Ranvir/Saif steals the 'highly protected' Shroud Of Turin with just a simple password-forgery and then escapes through the under ground drainage system (which was totally unprotected except an iron-lid); question is, why couldn't he use the same vent to enter the chamber in the first place?!! Can't blame the casts, everyone of them tried hard to live upto their expectations except Amisha Patel playing the role of Anil's extraordinaryly dumb, sex-starved secretary with her poor dressing sense and heavily innuendo-laden dialogues like "When will you pop my cherry?" In short, Race II is a wreck of a movie with pointless screenplay. Only thing racy about the movie is the sizzling Deepika Padukone." 
" A biased script and a DUMB villain gives RACE 2 a no fight.","Race 2 is about a smart hero and a dumb villain and that should have been the end of the story, but it continues. Saif is sleek as a knife and John is dumber than Ameesha 'the dumb girl' (who is supposed to act dumb). The script is plain with little twists, no turns and bad jokes that just fails to follow the trails of Race. Deepika is oozing steam but Jacqueline fails to look hot and vicious at the same time. The action scenes are way over the top, too Bollywood, or just scuffles (in fact, I was more impressed with the actions in the trailer of Commando). Just for a hint, one of the bigger villain says, "TUM BOH CHORI KARNE KI BAAT KAR RAHE HO JO AAJ TAK Hollywood MOVIES MAIN BHI NAHI HUA HAI".Race 2 is a blunt and pompous movie with a villain made (by the script) and act so dumb that the hero finishes the race without any scratch, with one of the lady (keep guessing) in an 'audi flying with parachutes' out of a chartered plane with everything else falling behind." 
" Race 2 is nothing but just show-off...","Race 2 is nothing but just show-offs of fancy cars, faces and freaks.Agent Vinod was an average watch and far better, so you can firmly skip this Rat Race and better watch any Fast & Furious again.Stunts were shot childish and story line was another weak point. The looks of John and Saif were good but you don't watch a movie just for their look. Girls were eye candies nothing else. Fight scenes could have been lot better and director has failed focusing on the theme of this movie. Before the end you already know, what is going to happen!Thumbs down to Race2 ! (1.5/5 Rating)" 
" Go for crazy action & thrill, not for twist & suspense","Revenge is a dish, best served cold. Abbas-Mustan is back with their patented ingredient of Suspense Thriller(More of thriller this time) & they serve it cold. It is a action-packed entertainer. It is a type of movie where different people will have different opinion. First half is very good with excellently shot chase scene(first of its kind in Bollywood), twist & turns(not like Race), action(fist fight in 2nd half), grey shades characters, glamor and of course countless money. But in 2nd half their is no suspense like Race(2008) with lots of loopholes . Climax Plane scene is not effective as expected. Be ready for RACE 3 as story is left open. Direction is good. Cinematography in awesome. Script is not as tight as expected. Except Ameesha, everyone is perfect in their roles. This time Saif outperform Abraham with mature dialogue delivery. Abraham Both girl looks really stylish & charming. Anil justifies his role completely. Last Word: Go for crazy action & thrill, not for twist & suspense." 
" A Nutshell Review: Race 2","The directing duo of Abbas-Mastan created Race back in 2008 that deals with the twists, turns, and double/triple crossings between two brothers Ranvir (Saif Ali Khan) and Rajiv (Akshaye Khanna), against an ostentatious backdrop that included the requisite flaunting of material wealth, horse racing, romance, and shady characters that included the likes of femme fatales in Bipasha Bashu and Katrina Kaif in one of her earlier Bollywood roles. The sequel boasts no less, although with only Saif Ali Khan and Anil Kapoor as the now ex police inspector Robert D'Costa returning, but adopting a similar formula that focused on the con.You don't really need to watch the first film because everything pretty much moved along in standalone fashion in this follow up, which spent a considerable part of the first half hour cementing the nastiness of brother-sister team Armaan (John Abraham) and Elena (Deepika Padukone). One's a street fighter who has never lost a fight, and brought out of the scene by Elena, the brains of their enduring and successful partnership, dabbling into various cons from casino tables, to just about owning an empire both in the light, and in the shady underworld. They form a formidable team, and individually, Shiraz Ahmed's story shows just how bad ass each can be, never batting an eyelid if they have to rely on good old fashioned murder or seduction to get at what they want.We're soon introduced to another new character played by Jacqueline Fernandez as Omisha, a thief who soon hooks up with Armaan not only because of his good looks but more importantly, his wealth and wicked demeanor, while Ranvir enters the picture to try and gain trust from the ruthless siblings to take on a larger con together, with Elena sending out her foxy signals right from the start. For a Bollywood movie, this covers the romance angle where the leads have their counterparts to woo, or in this case accelerated into the expected song and dance sequence in lieu of something more kinky that can't be shown on screen.But really, things just aren't that simple, where soon Ranvir gets involved with both women, though for different reasons, and has an objective and motivation that ties in with a key character from the past, as well as to answer the rather open ended prologue in this film. To say a lot more is to ruin the surprises that Abbas-Mastan have in store for audiences. This is a Race movie that has qualities to be expanded into yet another Bollywood franchise of rotating villains played by a top star for each installment, going along the Dhoom route. So expect that things will never be as they seem, and there's almost always a motive behind what someone will say and do, where loyalties can shift at will, and one-upmanship is the order of the game.Which happens to be the film's weakness as well. Sometimes the flip-flopping extracts a chunk of imagination, coincidence and stretches one's belief that the con actually began many steps beforehand, like a chess grandmaster playing against an amateur, that surprises spring out from the blue, with constant smirking that one got on top of the other, only for that smirk to be wiped out by an even larger wink. It can get tongue-in-cheek at times, and opened up loopholes that would be best glossed over for the entire narrative to work. Heavy reliance on sleight of hand techniques also called for plot convenience, with its fragmented narrative style forced to hide, and then present details of the con.Heavy reliance on CG is also telling, but here the CG still seemed rather cartoony, which suited the hyper-reality style of the world that the characters in Race exists in. It's entertainment for the masses, so Abbas-Mastan waste no time in plying implausible stunts in every death-defying escape, although a parkour sequence was expertly handled. Set action pieces get bigger as the film moved along, culminating in a really nutty climatic showdown thousands of feet in the air. It's one thing presenting large set action pieces, but another in presenting them well no matter how cheesy it would be. Someone forgot to tell the filmmakers to ease up on the cheesiness, but perhaps they had comedy in mind as well, with a key unintentional one given gossip rags on the John Abraham-Bipasha Basu relationship that will have audiences in stitches.John Abraham's hulking frame got put to good use, and in what would be the usual Salman- Khan style, there's built-in opportunity here for clothes to be shed in a stylized MMA caged fight, for some brawn to be added rather than to put him in a role whose character is only interested in whatever it takes to make money, and horde cash, in what would be a major negative role since his turn in the first Dhoom. Saif Ali Khan continues with the swagger and poser requirements as Ranvir from the first film, playing the ultimate conman now with a more personal vendetta at hand, and paired up yet again with Deepika Padukone for the umpteenth time. If anything, Deepika's role as Elena fit into the typical Bond girl role, in having little to do, little to add to the story, but there for the eye candy. And she carried off the lightweight role really well, as does Jacqueline Fernandez in yet another sequel of her career. Anil Kapoor is grossly underused here, if only to serve as the plot's conduit between characters, and spending most of his time with his character's secretary Cherry (Ameesha Patel), leering and spouting sexual innuendos.If movies with twists and turns at every other instant is your cup of tea, then Race 2 would be that popcorn entertainer you're looking for, with a good looking cast providing eye candy to wild away those two and a half hours. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you." 
" high energy level makes the time pass quickly","In my view, Bollywood has always been better at making action movies than romantic ones, which often come across as emotionally simpleminded and cloying, and "Race 2," a sequel to "Race" from 2008, is a case in point. Directed by Abbas-Mustan, this high-energy film may be all flash and no substance - but what flash! It tells the story of two high-living international playboys, Armaan (John Abraham) and Ranveer (Saif Ali Khan), whose combined wealth would make Aristotle Onassis green with envy. The two men are locked in a game of mortal combat after Armaan has Ranveer's girlfriend killed. There's even an attempt on the part of the two gazillionaires to steal the Shroud of Turin, no less. If there's one lesson to be gleaned from "Race 2," it's that some people really do have too much time and money on their hands.But the plotting - which is nearly impossible to follow anyway, what with its double and triple twists and its constantly shifting allegiances - is the least of the attractions of "Race 2," which is so beautifully photographed that it almost doesn't matter what's going on in the foreground of the picture. The pedal-to-the-metal pacing helps to mitigate, to some extent at least, the excessive length of the movie, and the chase and fight sequences are pretty damned spectacular, even if they do strain credibility on a regular basis (there are even blatant rip-offs of "Speed" and "Air Force One" along the way). The movie also restricts itself to a bare minimum of those annoying song-and-dance numbers that are practically de rigueur in any Bollywood production, though there's a ferocious cage match scene that ends on too downbeat a note for a film of this frivolous a nature. There may not be a lot of food for thought in "Race 2," but the movie does provide a feast for the eyes." 
" Race 2 Hindi film review","Please go to this film with only entertainment in mind. Do not think of logics and possibilities at any stage. If you follow this rule, you will enjoy this film, this is my guarantee As expected the film Race-2 turned out to be an exciting film. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Indian films have not only reached Hollywood levels but also have surpassed them in terms of entertainment values and taking styles.Right from the first scene this film maintains its tempo. Directors duo Abbas – Mustan have handled the script very well and presented a fine enjoyable package.The entire film script works and rotates around the combination of Saif Ali Khan, Deepika Padukone, John Abraham and the Srilankan dusky beauty Jacqueline Fernandez. Not to leave out the cameo duo of Anil Kapoor and Amisha Patel.The photography, screen play, taking of scenes is simply out of the world, or at least like Hollywood style.The one-liner comedy dialogues are very good. Film is having lot of such dialogues.In the entire film there are only two instances where I felt bored. One is a song in second half and the other one is the fight in the aircraft almost nearing climax. Rest all excellent. The highlights of the film can be mentioned as the running chase between the killer shooter and Saif Ali Khan.Saif rocks in this film. Deepika and Jacqueline are looking very pretty and attractive. John could able to flex his muscles a lot in this film. Anil Kapoor and Amisha Patel play the roles of a comedy duo type.Just go and watch.enjoyable film, good time pass. Yes you are right, RACE – 3 will come as per the climax." 
" same as RACE......","5 years ago , Abbas-Mustan directed Race set a new level in the thriller genre as far as bollywood is concerned....RACE-2 is no different...As a sequel to RACE i expected this movie to be highly suspenseful, twistful and action packed....which it indeed was.....but what it failed to do was distinguish itself from its prequel...the same kind of storyline, same twists, same type of characters and same scenes were cloned throughout the entire movie... the climax scene was very poorly and sadly executed....If u've watched RACE, you can easily predict certain part of the sequences and it makes you feel no different....But unlike RACE, apart from only planning and plotting, some action sequences have also been included and to my surprise, they have been executed to perfection....Along with action, cinematography and background score have been the most unique features of RACE-2...As far as the cast is concerned,there are average performances by JOHN, DEEPIKA and others, but its SAIF who steals all the way...JOHN would have done a far better in a negative role...but fails to impress much...Finally RACE-2 has all the contents to make it a good thriller film with unexpected twists, but it would have been much much better if the script would have different from its prequel...." 
" Not up to the mark but still entertaining","you actually can't expect anything when you plan to watch a ABBAS-MUSTAN film...that's how happened before PLAYERS in last year...after players totally bombed at the box office...ab-bas mustan next project canceled because of budget reason.But the duo any how managed to convince producers by approaching the project race 2.and how the making of sequel begins.No doubt Race 1 is still best.you'll miss Katrina kaif,akshay khanna and sizzling dances in race 1 songs...in race 2 directer duo tried to make a thrilling story with too much twists...but the problem they made their...so many holes you can figure out on that moments..first of all in this 2013,where children and youths are grown watching ocean trilogy and transporter..you just can't surprise them just like that...they can even tell the main thing before it's appearance on screen.they love actions..lot of actions.directer gave them ..but some of them is too realistic and some of them are too rajnikanth type...again their they loose their interest...but any how movie can keep your attention because of twist.so many twist,that you can't leave it for a moment...but sometimes those twists can look too old for you..because same thing you watched at previous RACE and also in naquaab and in some Hollywood films like ocean eleven, twelve and thirteen.and with in this 4 year gap so many movies came ..so it can't attract you so much.And of course Bollywood climax...with extreme fight...some actions are real and something you can't imagine..not even rajnikaanth...like jumping of saif with deepika in a Audi car from A380 flight at 15000 ft...so that's why i'm saying movie is overall GOOD....BECAUSE OF SO MUCH GLAMOUR AND REVENGE & TWIST .song s are very good..even ending title RACE 2 mash up...but in the end you'll feel movie's not up to the mark.and actually it is..but still entertaining. WILL YOU WATCH IT: > of course go for saif,deepika,john,glamor and style.what's bad: >so much twist can tired you.but you can easily guess the right thing.so it can't surprise you. john as a villain is not so good. Anil kappor and Amisha Patel's character were most worthless and useless.i actually felt sorry for them doing this type of roles.what's good: >songs,some actions, dialogues and GLAMOUR ,STYLEverdict: >NOT UP TO THE MARK.RACE 1 WAS BETTER."
