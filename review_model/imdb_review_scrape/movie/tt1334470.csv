" A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Mani's crown jewel and a landmark in Indian Cinema","Mani Ratnam is the undisputed heir to the legacy laid by the great Indian auteurs like Guru Dutt, Satyajit Ray, Raj Kapoor and Shayam Benegal. If movies like Roja, Bombay, Yuva were the cornerstones of his career then Raavan would definitely be the crowning jewel. Despite being a rendition of the Ramayana, Raavan is avant garde on countless fronts. The cinematography of the movie is both detailed and picturesque, and enormously adds to its poignant beauty. Mani dauntlessly transforms the eternal saga of the Ramayana into a much profound tale which transcends the trite theme of virtue versus vice; a gigantic task which a lesser director could have easily botched. The tone of the movie is set right from the first scene and gets enhanced with subsequent scenes. The pristineness of the movie gives it an uncanny charm that makes the viewing experience, titillating and nigh ineffable. The picaresque theme of the movie may appear to be commonplace, but movie's exotic backdrop and meticulous execution make it augustly unique.The first half of the movie is deliberately paced which gives it a poetic effect that is seldom associated with contemporary Indian movies. Rehman's plaintive score lulls the viewer into a state of trance which sustains beyond the length of the movie.Abhishek Bachchan outdoes himself as an actor in the portrayal of glacial yet vulnerable, Beera, a part which required subtlety and brusqueness in equal parts. Mani Ratnam is known to get the best out of his actors, and even he would be proud of Bachchan's performance in Raavan. Incidentally, it was Mani Ratnam who helped Bachchan get rid of the ham status by trusting him with parts in Yuva and Guru. Aishwarya Rai gives a thorough performance doing full justice to her talent and pulchritude. During the course of the movie, one incredibly gets to see her in all the nine rasas (essential aspects or energies that define a set of emotions and moods). Govinda is invidiously under used in the movie and hence fails to leave an impact. The rest of the cast has given commendable performances with a special mention of Bhojpuri actor, Ravi Kishan.Barring a few redundant scenes, Raavan is consummate in every sense of the word, and has enough to fascinate the masses, awe the critics, and teach the students of cinema. In fact, it will undoubtedly serve as a benchmark for the movies in years to come.PS: Raavan is a must watch for those who love Hindi cinema and for those who want to acquaint themselves with it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/" 
" A spiritual journey with poetic insight - RAAVAN","What a man seeks from maniratnam's movies. Not but purity, poetry, beauty, artistic intensity(Very few can reach such depths) and finally truth. What is his intrinsic authority to define what right and what is wrong? Some of his movies are fierceful with electrifying emotions and some are merely soulful and poetic like torrents of silent river with the dancing of light and shadow. May sometimes intellectuals and mob can't find entertainment from his movies. But few are with vibrant and sensible hearts with child's like enthusiasm could feel the power, depth and humility in his movies. He is one of the greatest artists of our time which world couldn't able to understand. He didn't get fame what he deserves. Like the poems of rabindranath tagore, as you muse and feel more and more you will get more spiritual experience from his movies. Like terrance malik's movies his movies dissolve with nature and poetic sadness and with life's music. They will open our hearts to life, love and beauty. For those who want to know what life are, what are morals, what is right and what is wrong. Are they prefixed and reformulated. Or shall we explore, question ourselves with abundance of love in our hearts towards the things of world to know ourselves what is truth. That journey is RAAVAN. Few may don't like this movie because they may not get thrill from the movie. Only sheer poetry, exploration of truth exists in the movie. Master story teller's hands are as soft as ever. Though, for this movie those are more complex because those are now more simpler." 
" A visual smokescreen is all it has to flaunt","So what do you do when you've got on your hands, one of those most interesting and misunderstood characters of all time? A context that has such layered underlying themes – Political, psychological and social? Possibly the chance to turn the reality that every Ramanand Sagar extravaganza has drilled into us, on its head? MR does dare venture this territory. Sadly, it remains Terra incognito even as the end credits roll. Ironically, the jaw dropping beautiful locales and cinematography do the movie in. They set the stage for something spectacular, operatic and epic- something the movie doesn't achieve in its entire running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes. Most of the fault lies with the flimsy writing and one dimensional characterization. The name of the movie for Cryin' out loud- Is Ravaan. The learned and spiritual uber villain of the epic. This Beera is reduced to a boor that mumbles incoherencies and borrows expressions from the Exorcist (and daddy dearest in RGV ki Aag) and evidently suffers from a bad case of head lice. Forget Ramayana, I am thinking he tottered out of the pages of twinkle comics. He speaks Hindi in a rustic dialect which miraculously disappears in the songs. The biggest flaw lies in the fact that the 'good' in Beera is achieved by 'demonising' Ram (ACP Dev). On his own, he has no stand to take. Abhishek Bacchan , well, there is really NO erudite way of saying this. He sucks! Twitchy head movements and deranged smiles et al. He possibly might be the product of one of his mountaineering attempts gone wrong and him landing on his head. Aishwarya screeches so much in the first half that you want Beera to set her free for his own good. But once she puts a lid on the ham, she emerges as one of the stronger performers. Eclipsing Abhishek and Vikram in every frame, she effortlessly looks ethereal - wide eyed and drenched locks set against the primal and mystic forest. A more ballsy ending would have done 'Sita' more justice. For once she isn't the Domex drenched doormat most Indian women are expected to be on celluloid. She is, in spite of herself attracted to the Beera, questions the 'Mariyaada Purushottam' and makes her way back to Beera in the climatic sequences. I'd have readily forgiven most follies of the movie had She stayed with Beera. However, on some level I don't blame the makers. This is after all the land where anything can be turned saffron and demolished for taking a different stand. And yes, there is a Ram thrown in for good measure. Why waste the national award winner Vikram in this role? His exists on the canvas only to be blackened enough to make Beera look like the victim of a witch hunt. Again, Beera in himself is never layered enough – merely canonized indirectly. Ravi Kishan as Beera's brother turns in a good performance. Govinda has man boobs. Enough said. AR Rehman's score exists. But that's about it. I don't know if it was inherently lackadaisical, irrelevant or if I was too jaded to react to it. When will we ever learn to use soundtrack to propel the story forward? And now for the ugly.A terrible background score. A forest should sound as good as it looks – Here, absolutely NO use of the natural sounds to heighten the atmosphere. Instead we have jarring George of the Jungle beats. Unless they wanted to make a point about the extinction of species, not one non-human organism is spotted. One of the cheesiest dialogue I have ever come across on the screen.An embarrassment when pitched against the slick,witty and tight writing of MR's preceding works, Guru and Yuva.Baffling logical inconsistencies – Aishwarya is led into the big, bad forest blindfolded. But in the climatic sequences she effortlessly makes her way back to Beera. With no clue that over 50 men are minutes behind on her trail. A special mention for how spotless her white clothing remains throughout this entire journey. The only saving grace is Santosh Sivan's cinematography. Which makes this the cinematic equivalent of a dumb blonde. My apologies if my review reads too tepid. Usually I am unforgiving and caustic to the movies I hate. This one has left me too jaded to even abuse it properly." 
" Visually great, but weak narrative and main performances","It's OK for a one time watch, but one expects much much better from Mani Ratnam. Of all the Master's efforts, I found this his weakest effort. Lots of style with little substance. Santosh Sivan and V. Manikandan's cinematography of the lush locales is breath-taking, but scenery alone does not make a brilliant movie. It is basically the typical Hindi film revenge plot, but told from the perspective of the 'victim' of the vengeance seeker. It's even using the tired old sister and rape sequence. I know it's also based on the Ramayan, but as a non-Hindu, all of that means little to me. Acting by the main characters is all mediocre, but supporting performances by Ravi Kissen and Nikhil Dwivedi were both excellent. AB Jr.'s chak-a-chak was grating as much as Aishwarya's non-stop screaming (as was Rahman's over the top background score). Let's hope next time Ratnam chooses different actors for his movie. These two were great in Guru, but very out of sorts here." 
" Raavan is you....","This movie is about any human being out there, the conflict that he faces inside him. All of us many personalities in us but we never show them out because we want to gel into the society with no hassle. And very few of them break out from the 'ego' phase of our personality.And that is the theme here. I never was a fan of Abhishek, but with this one he has blown me away. Brilliant and perfect. Very few directors rely on eye and facial expressions for conveying their message forward and Mani belongs to that category. Abhishek here fits the bill perfectly. Aishwarya looks beautiful and Vikram has done justice to his role. What needs to be seen is how he fares in the Tamil version where he portrays the title character. Govinda returns after a long time and it is good to see that he has got something substantial to do here. Mani's direction in some sequences really gave me goosebumps especially the scene where the camera goes round Abhishek for a few minutes showcasing his confused mind. Next up is...Santosh Sivan..he is a major star in this movie. Without his touch this movie would not have been on the average range. Even a normal location has been brought to life through his lens. Though there were a few glitches his work here is amazing. ARR...the man, his songs rocked. And special mention goes to the opening credit sequence. All in all, watch this for Mani, Abhi, Santosh and ARR." 
" Mani Ratnam's Fallacy....","Here is where the creatures of the dark dwell; where fear creeps through the shadows of the foliage, the sounds of life buzz through the night and cascading waterfalls provide the spectacular backdrop for the damsel in distress..... the one who is taken hostage by the merciless evil who will stop at nothing to unleash terror. Then, there is the hero who will stop at nothing to release his love from the clutches of evil. The duel is engaging, exciting, thrilling and gruesome and if that is what you're looking for, then watch RamGopal Verma's 'JUNGLE' .... not 'Raavan'.When Mani Ratnam decides to create a world of a demon God in a movie, the expectations are obviously high. One: because he is Mani Ratnam, two: because some of the actors claimed it to be their best work and three: it was supposed to draw inspirations from the epic Ramayana. We saw the Mahabharata unfold in today's political backdrop in Raajneeti with some remarkable execution but such is not the case with 'Raavan'. Let alone the Ramayana, the film is not even a worthy copy of Jungle! All elements of thrill, intensity, evil, shock, suspense and terror are completely missing in 'Raavan'. The formidable Raakshas was a powerful character who excelled in what he did and the terror he unleashed was unfathomable but Beera's character is more like a maniac who has followers for some inexplicable reason. Neither is he terrifying in appearance nor are his tactics menacing and moreover, he is out to seek revenge for what his sister went through. The biggest problem with Beera's character is that he is driven by this vengeance. That is clearly not the purest form of evil unlike the real Raavan, Durga (Jungle) or Raaghvan (Aks). The sister's incident warrants our sympathy for this villain and to an extent, our support in his endeavour. How can one feel terrorized in that case? Mani Ratnam's entire premise of evil thus tends to be fallacious. If that wasn't enough, we have to evaluate how genuine Ram's (Dev) character is since he cares less about his Sita (Ragini) and more about capturing Beera. Sheer lack of consistency in plot results in the actors being confused about their unwritten roles, song sequences acting as fillers in screenplay, predictability of sequences and the boredom of audience. Santosh Sivan is perhaps the only reason one can withstand Raavan. His cinematography of the spell-binding locations, is exemplary! So are the sequences where every character is captured in brilliant light, shadow and close ups. AR Rahman's music, though not his best, captures attention with the upbeat Beera included in the titles and Behne De - the current epitome of Gulzar, Rahman and Santosh Sivan's work combined. Whereas, Thok di khilli will be remembered more for Abhishek's inability to dance, Kata Kata bakra as the unnecessary filler in a digressed story and Ranjha Ranjha and Khili Re wandering in the background as the story sets into flashback mode at different points. Thus, the numerous songs become a misfit in a demonic thriller and in the absence of merciless editing, they only tend to prolong the unease while watching.Vikram could've had a juicier role and that perhaps was the let down with his character. His performance too, lacked variety in expression. Govinda was a delight to watch in the role of Hanuman but his character was nothing like the Ape God. Although he provides comic relief and whatever sanity there was, he has a screen presence of less than 9 minutes which is simply not enough. Ravi Kishan as Beera's brother was very convincing in his role and was very expressive in almost every given scenario. Aishwarya Rai was just disappointing. All the yelling, shrieking, artificial tears (red eyed), irrational behavior and the profound obtuseness of her character downplayed all that she was otherwise capable of. Abhishek Bachchan has done much better in his previous ventures with Mani Ratnam and here, he is nothing more than an actor left by himself to do whatever he can with some ugly make up and the jungle around him. Where is the 'Raakshas' in his portrayal of Raavan? Why the eccentric behavior and straight face in seriousness? And why the sheer inability to perform a simple dance? Although the character was vague and incomplete, Abhishek, this time was a total disappointment with whatever he had. He seemed too casual in his approach in critical scenes. What is it that they say...... he just couldn't get 'into the character'.When the age has come for innovation, change, and novelty, Mani Ratnam fails to live up to expectations. The script, screenplay, characterization, plot, performances and direction were all flawed and these factors could've been taken with a pinch of salt from another film maker but not The Mani Ratnam. Watch 'Raavan' only if it airs on Television..... you will need the breaks.6.56 on a scale of 1-10." 
" An epic retold with magnificent visual splendour but falling well short of being memorable","Mani Ratnam's much anticipated multi lingual Raavan (a.k.a Raavanan in Tamil) is a commendable and bold cinematic effort to recreate the timeless epic of Ramayana which embodies universally appealing values of heroism, jealousy , mistrust , revenge and evil. Though evil here is more about revealing the antihero in Raavan and seeing those same traits ironically reversed in Ram at another point in time. Ram here is Dev (played by Vikram)a duty bound cop with a single mission to bring down his nemesis Beera (played by Abhishek) who is the protector of the downtrodden but one who does not let morals come in his way. A much wanted criminal in the eyes of the law. His philosophy is almost a Mahabharata borrowed one of "ends justify the means". What drives him to do that one thing that bring hims onto a vengeful collision path with Dev is unveiled slowly during the movie . It all starts off with the abduction by Beera of the character based on Sita , represented as Ragini (played by Aishwarya). Ragini is the wife of Dev and this begins the odyssey set against some of the most spectacular landscapes shot most brilliantly and expectedly by Santosh Sivan. Set against lush forests, deep gorges, inundated streams and constant cleansing of the earth by the abundant rain, Ragini tied and gagged is dragged along by Beera, with Dev and his band of other cops in pursuit. Beera is an unusual specimen, intense , unpredictable, maniacal yet a character with whom one does start forming a bond of affection and empathy as we realise a certain lovable and humane side of his character. Abhishesh plays Beera industriously , trying to get under the skin of the character even though there are mannerisms which could have been handled more subtly but then that is the directors outlook. In all a performance worth acknowledging set against the often churned out mediocrity of Bollywood. One can't ever relegate Aishwarya to the background and not the least here because she is the focal point of the movie, the one who is subjected to a cruel fate. She does portray her character with intensity but what annoys is her voice and associated intonation and that creates a certain hamming like effect. No doubt sensing the potential of such a role, she does seem to have put in that little extra effort. Her beauty, with time has not waned and she is graceful and classic at most times. Dev played by Vikram is powerful for the action sequences and when he is angry but surely Mani Ratnam should not be compromising on the power of speech expecting delivery in Hindi from a chap who is not a natural Hindi speaker. Govinda plays the character based on Hanuman and is at best a very marginal role. Others including brothers of Beera and the aggrieved step sister of Beera player by Priyamani are all just about OK. Now the reason that I believe this is not a memorable movie is on account of the fact that Mani Ratnam has excessively depended on visuals and even facial expressions to attempt to create a unique experience but this comes at the expense of dialogues which lack the punch and often is mistimed. The narrative does not really dig deep into the characters and reveal their flaws and strengths. Abhishek has done what he could as his best but was he the best choice? Finally the climax and the last 30 mins of the movie is a lot more engaging and does eventually make you leave the movie hall with a fair amount of satisfaction but with a lingering doubt as to if this is indeed the best we can now expect from Mani Ratnam ? Once you have finished watching the movie in a movie hall (not on DVD), think of the opening sequence." 
" One royal disappointment. Mani's worst movie in the last 25 years.","From the trailer and the general talk, you might have guessed the basic premise. Raavan (Abhishek Bacchhan) kidnaps Sita (Aish). Ram (Vikram), with the help of Hanuman (Govinda) tries to get Sita back and kill Raavan. Of course, the motivation for Raavan's abduction of Sita is the insult of Surpanaka (Priyamani). What if this basic premise constitutes the entire movie with nothing else? The movie is going to suck & that is what Raavan is. What makes the original Ramayan interesting is the many many interesting characters and subplots without which even it would be uninteresting. This is where Raavan fails.The plot is as thin as a razor blade. Screenplay is one jumbled mess especially in the 1st half. Mani Ratnam is my most favourite Indian director & it is really really hard for me to digest that he had directed this mess.Abhishek Bacchhan was absolutely irritating as Beera. Since his only good performances were in Yuva & Guru which were directed by Mani, I thought he will be good as Beera. But what an irritating interpretation of the role! Aish's only duty in the movie was to look beautiful and scream at regular intervals which she does greatly. Vikram has nothing much to do. His character was badly written. Priyamani is good in her brief appearance. Govinda and Ravi Kishan are the two bright spots as far as acting department is considered.The locations and cinematography are breathtaking to say the least. Raavan is a heavy contender in the next award season as far as cinematography is considered. The same goes for music. Rahman gave a great music and background score. But since general public wouldn't be interested in only photography and music, I can see empty theaters and a doomed future for the movie. I will be happy if I'm wrong. I really can't believe Mani Ratnam has directed this entirely from his heart.I've seen each one of Mani's movies of the last 25 years & without doubt Raavan is Mani Ratnam's most uninteresting movie. The first half is as dumb as you can get. The entire 1st half is like one long personal holiday photo-shoot of AbhiAsh with some exotic background views. The 2nd half is slightly better but on the whole, Raavan is a 140 minute advertisement for the beauty of Aish & India's forests.I also wanted to see Villain (Raavan in Telugu) because of Vikram who plays Raavan in this version. But after this experience, I neither have the patience nor energy to do it. May be some time after the DVD comes out." 
" Aesthetisiscm gone out of place.","Here's a short pointer to you before you buy the ticket. This review may be lost in the ocean of views which the public will put forth in a few days. Anyway, here goes. Did Raavan reach our expectations? Not even close. Actually, it's miles below a average movie. Oh yes, it was colorful like many of our friends suggested. Eye- pleasing visuals, rocking music or crisp editing need not make a movie watchable. Looks like this movie is a towering example of my point. You need to have a flawless script, where the characters in the movie are elevated to many layers. That should imply that Raavan is absolute nonsense. It is a pessimistic point of view of an epic.If someone can highlight few less eminent incidents in the epic 'Ramayana' like the Soorpanaka chapter or Rama's inherent doubts, just to make Raavan great, it is blasphemy. Evil blown out of proportion. And please; these views are not less 'intellectual'. When someone twists facts to fit one's theories, even Ayn Rand or Nietzche won't pacify with them. Do yourself a favor, do NOT watch Raavan. Forget that such a movie ever released and carry on. P.S. Mani Rathnam, here's an advice. Please retire gracefully or watch your beautiful films again a hundred times.Man,you let us down." 
" A fair fare...","Mani's modern day take on Ramayana lacks the usual punch associated with his regular movies, but is still a commendable effort. Brilliant cinematography, capturing the pristine beauty of the unexplored areas of Kerala, is simply too beautiful for words. Rahman's music plays in nicely with the movie tones, still won't consider it among some of his best works. The song "Thok de killi" really seemed out of place and unnecessary. Among the cast, Aishwarya shines in the role of 'Ragini' efficiently portraying a wide range of emotions that her role offers. The other roles, I felt really didn't have much to offer to the characters. Abhishek gives an average performance as 'Beera', not withstanding the in-between schizophrenic antics. Usually Mani's male actors have much more stronger persona and presence. Vikram & Govinda give good performance in their 'cameo' like roles. Priyamani does a good job as well. Ash is too ravishing for words and her moods, and movements are beautifully captured. Coming to the story line, I think the key point Mani was trying to portray is how the ancient epic plays out in the modern day world. Most of the story elements try to adhere to the different events from the actual 'Ramayana'. The action sequences are mostly well choreographed, the fighting sequence on the rope-bridge being the key one to look out for. Mani has tried to highlight the more controversial elements in the Ramayana, most of which is not talked about usually with preponderance, the key events here being (1) Surpanakha's treatment (2) Sita's Agnipareeksha. The story lacks though in certain fronts, mainly Vikram's actions against 'Beera' are not well justified as 'Beera's' anti-social activities are not explained well enough. All in all a good one time watch, for ash at least!" 
" one of the finest efforts in Indian Cinema","Producer-director Mani Ratnam maintains his trademark focus on emotions, while adding a flamboyant flair. Everything from the costume, to the hair, to the location, to the cinematography: there's drama in every frame.Enjoy this very different take on the story everyone knows. After all, if not offering a special perspective, what use is an adaptation? Don't miss itRaavanan is a treat for quality cinema loversRaavan gets rave reviews in the American media as a reviewer selection. Popularity also can be seen as it released on Friday over 2200 theaters through out the world in 35 countries along with US and Canada." 
" Beautiful, Excellent, Wild & Passionate Movie","An exceptionally brilliant movie by Mani Ratnam. Impressive performance by all our great artist Vikram (National Award Winner), Abi & Ash. Worth watching in Theaters. Portraying Indian Epic Ramayan in todays world is very artfully and captured in toughest & most picturesque locations in India forest. Once again a blissful music by Academy Winner AR Rehaman(4 National Awards) and admirable cinematography by Santom Sivan(4 National Awards) & Manikandan. Its a new dimension to Indian movie and have raised the bar of Indian Cinema. Its the movie of the year 2010. Vikram playing the dual role of Police Office in Hindi and Raavana in Tamil, the toughest part for an actor to change character every hour during shooting. Raavan is a strong contender for Oscars - Best Foreign Film." 
" From Lallan to Beera.... making of an Actor.","Remember Amrish Puri of 80-90s, as soon as he enters in the scene you start having a nasty feeling of fear, hate and disgust. His cruelty goes within your skin and you abhor him like anything. That's the same terror and nasty sensation Abhishek was able to produce in Raavan. It was Yuva where I saw Abhishek's true potential first time and its Raavan where he shows where he belongs to. Even though Lallan was having kind of negative shades, and Raavan is Villain like hell, but hats off to Maniratnam to bring such a class act out of Abhishek. In entire movie you see and admire him just as an Abhishek, no more papa's boy and no more papa's copy. It was worth every penny to see him grown up as full blown actor. I was so engross with Abhishek's performance that Vikram and Ashwarya, totally justifying there presence were not able to get my attention.Usually when you came out of watching Maniratnam's movie, you found your heart felt tense, your mind ponder heavily, your feet takes smaller steps and your face looks grimmer. While watching Raavan these emotion increases many fold. A totally different experience than how you feel watching Rajkumar Hirani's movie.I think this movie belongs to different genre for different set of audience. It may not be a blockbuster, but this will not change anything about quality of movie. It is pleasant to see that Indian cinema is now a day adventures enough to produce offbeat roles and movies with quality acting and direction. If wanting to relax is not the only criteria you watch movies for then I strongly recommend you this gem. 7.5/10." 
" The 10 HEADS are gripping and intense!","Enough of excitement and curiousness for Raavan ensured a first day,first show ticket with my friends.I was just hoping and praying that it would surmount my expectations and it did.Well almost!What more could you ask for?Aishwarya,Abhi and Vikram in a love triangle with Rahman to tease your ears,Mani to embellish and set the screen on fire.It all made it a deadly combination and be ready to gorge your eyes to a tale narrated like never before.Excellent visuals,witty dialogues,intense acting make Raavan a spectacular experience ought to yearn for.Beera rules the roost and how!10 minutes into the ten heads,you get a whole glimpse into the thick of surroundings.A tough police officer,a gritty follower,a nifty wife,a brutal ' raakshas' and a whole village supporting him.The first hour mostly invades our time to capture the mindset of all these people Beera(Junior B),Raagini(Aishwarya Rai),Dev(Vikram)who form the core and crust of the film.The director doesn't waste much time in conveying the plot of kidnapping Raagini and putting her through immense torture both physically and mentally.Dev,a firm person is determined enough to win back his wife who barely can live without him.The introduction of Hanuman(Govinda) ensures lighter moments in a somewhat serious first half.The latter part concentrates mostly on the cat and mouse chases creating a lively and a nervous atmosphere.With the amazing cinematography,going past the first half is a visual treat to the audiences.Shot in Kerala,the waterfalls,the forests are so full of life and the director uses the locations to his best effect and enhances the beauty of each scene.The second half is where the film scores a lot .The pace quickens unlike the first half and the battle raging between both the sides turns wild and take weird turns keeping the viewers glued to their seats.The colours are beautiful,the village has a child like innocence,you feel sympathy for each of the characters that undergo pain and stress.The villain tries every possibility to kill Raagini.But she isn't the one who's there to get victimized.She's brave and she'll have a death at her own desired moment and none can change that.She's a fire brand and Beera recognizes it.She tries to escape,puts up a brave face and her eyes spark not even an ounce of fear.Some thing is influencing his mind to get mad about her.After all Beera has his own reason for the series of events which have occurred.He explains his grief and distress on what made him into a person whose emotions are unpredictable.One person having ten thoughts rolling inside his brain each second.Does this create a softer side of Beera in Raagini's heart?Will Beera ever spare Raagini or Dev?Is the person who dies always is the bad guy?Is this a thought of our society or if not what's the truth?Why can't we think on the lines on why is Beera like this?The gripping climax will provide a bold answer to these startling questions.The fight in the climax is precariously shot and will set the first bencher's abuzz.As like his previous movies,Mani pours life into a simple story and creates a mind boggling impact.Though not as polished as before,this works good time.The minutest details too are taken care off very well and the sweat and hard work gone into the making shows.If viewed as a contemporary version of the epic Ramayana,this one doesn't work.It doesn't have enough depth to penetrate the characters into the viewers.If seen as an experimental cinema,the ideals are great,the modification is inexplicable,so we better put our comparisons aside to satisfy us entirely.Credit to him though to make a film that's a break from the formulaic stuff.Coming to the performances,Abhishek holds his stand firm and portrays a character of varied emotions very well.He's grown as an actor since those days of Yuva,Bunty aur Babli.He displays the unpredictability of the character to perfection.I in fact do not want to watch the Tamil version of it because I expect it to be no way closer to this one. Aishwarya stuck between characters as different as chalk and cheese,two different sides of a coin handles her part extraordinarily.She's far beyond her skin and good looks and this one proves it yet again.She besides Abhi is the soul of the film.Her scenes with her hubby are of good taste and will evoke good critical acclaim.She looks to have put on a few pounds and the earlier she realises,the better it'll be as she isn't growing any younger.Vikram did a good job but he's done these better in Saamy,Anniyan and many other ones.There's no new facet of his acting explored.In short,he's wasted in an angry cop role.Nikhil Dwivedi is passable in a short role.Priyamani makes her presence felt and the start isn't at all bad for a debut.Ravi Kishan is irritating to say the least.Govinda packs a punch and tries to do something beyond slapstick comedy,an honest effort.Supporting characters are a mixed bag but they don't do that bad either.Rahman uses his experiments perfectly that's neither loud nor low.Gulzar's lyrics are pumping.Cinematography by ManiKandan and Santosh Sivan puts a viewer into the film.Raavan doesn't start well,but makes up for it as we move on into the film.It's a journey that we don't often travel and a path we rarely witness.Though not error free,its still a feather in the cap for Mani Ratnam to create such a splendid picturesque work.Be patient enough and keep your expectations a tad less and you won't be at loss.Its a drama,an event,a classic in the reckoning!" 
" Doesn't do justice with the great epic but still good entertainment...","Raavan is another movie from veteran Indian movie director Mani Ratnam. As the movie is the adaptation of Ramayana,(one of the greatest epic ever told) set up in the present world,I was pretty excited to watch this movie and had lots of expectations from this when i went to theater betting my 150 rupees on it(my whole week pocket money).As in original Ramayana there was a battle between good and evil.The good one was prince Ram(a epitome of complete virtuous,perfect man),his wife(a epitome of perfect,completely pure woman),his brother Laxman and Hanuman.The evil one was Raavan,a complete evil man,entirely opposite of Ram.Now,the events occurs in the epic are almost same in the movie too but as the movie is based on modern world,there is a difference in characterization so the consequences of the events occurs are also different.In the movie a naxalite bandit Beera(Raavan) who is also the lead character of the movie,kidnap Ragini(Sita) who is the wife of police officer Dev(Ram).Beera unlike Raavan is not completely evil(he is shown like Robin Hood). Kidnapping Ragini is not an act of lust and greed but but an act to avenge his sister's iniquitous death who was raped in police custody.He is wild,violent and ruthless to his enemies but he is not evil he also have a righteous side.Also,Dev unlike prince Ram is not righteous,he is evil and cruel and can outreach the limit of morals and ethics to rescue his wife.As the story moves Beera fall in love with Ragini and Ragini came to know good side of Beera and the dark side of her husband.Due to all this changes occurs,the outcome of the movie is completely different from the epic,but i admit it was brilliant.The best thing of the movie is its cinematography which is done by the very talented Santosh Sivan,he is the best at his work and this movie is the most brilliant work from him so far.The exquisite beauty of Indian forests,waterfalls,rivers and the villages are captured beautifully. Raavan has the best cinematography any Indian movie ever had,almost parallel to international standards(like Last of the Mohicans) and it is the greatest achievement for this movie.The direction of Mani Ratnam is very good and there is no doubt,at present he is the best director of India.Casting of the movie is grand and the performance from all the caste(except Abhishek) is splendid.The performance of Aishwarya Rai as Ragini is very powerful and colorful.In recent years,she establish herself as an actress of substance and maturity.Her transformation from a beauty queen to an talented actress is really worthy to be praise and admire.Once Roger Ebert said about her that she is not only first but also second most beautiful woman in the world,and I agree with him on this one.Now,she is the deadly combination of both beauty and talent.The other actors did their part very well.Vikram's acting as Dev was thrilling and chilling.Govinda and Ravi kishan both did well in small but important roles.The soundtrack of the movie is given by Oscar winner A.R Rehman and he did another outstanding job under his mentor Mani Ratnam.Among the bad things,the most disappointing is the performance of Abhishek Bachchan as a lead role of Raavan.He did not perfectly fit in the role and did lots of mistakes like his accent of a rural man and his expressions all seemed so artificial and out of place.He is among the most over-rated actor of bollywood and he continuously fail to deliver performance.He certainly was not the right choice to did the role.Plot development is another thing that disappoint me,the movie before interval was so fast and the events occurred very quickly and just after interval they inserted the song( and all those dancing stuffs,which i hate so much)this all things left me untouched and unsatisfied.The problem was in the script, you cannot make only 135 hour long movie on a seven books long epic(Ramayana is the second largest epic after Mahabharata) and also add two dancing songs.I admit ending was very good and make a lot of sense but the disappointment was in how they reached to the ending.I was delighted when i heard that Mani Ratnam was adapting Ramayana into the modern world.This is the first effort from bollywood to adapt such a great epic and only Mani Ratnam had the potential to do justification to such a great epic.But,i truly admit Mani Ratnam failed to deliver completely.Yes,the movie was entertaining and had every aspect that Indian audience expect from bollywood movie and there is no doubt in my mind that the movie will be a big commercial success." 
" Visually pleasing","Well by this time many would have watched this movie either in Tamil, Telugu or Hindi, but did Raavan or Ravanan lived to its expectation???? Thats a big Q !!!!!!! Frankly saying this is not Manis best movie. Each time his movie comes the expectation is sky high, but all his movies lived up to it. But with Raavan one cannot say it. The plot seems to be a very thin line, but with such a huge talented star cast, the movie could have been much better. Its not fair enough to say that this his best or worst, cos each of his movies is a yardstick on its own as all his movies are of different genre. Watch Raavan with an open mind, do not look for Ram alone in the movie cos u may be deceived. Its a visual treat from start till end, Mani is a genius, with the right team he has extracted the best from his crew, but still, when u walk out of the hall there is something in the movie ponders you. Is it the Ram or Raavan? Good or Evil???? Above all did the director achieve his target? Watch this movie in the hall or else u will miss the depth of the visuals which is absolutely breathtaking."
