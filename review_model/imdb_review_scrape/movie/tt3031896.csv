" one of the best mafia movie ever made..!!","going into the movie to be honest ,i had hardly any expectations .Been recommended by a close bud as he knows my love for mafia movies..i played the movie at my own risk and believe me when i say this 50minutes in it i was left spellbound..there is a line in it which say's.."Bhai ban NE KIA ticket ya hi SE Milta Hain'...Lakeer KE Fakeer is a gripping hard hitting type of movie which leaves no stone unturned in way of telling true story..the dialogs are so realistic that any person who have anytime visited dark areas of Mumbai would connect to it easily.but the surprise found is "ajaz khan" the lead shines out of nowhere blending the role of Fakeer Mohamed like he was tailored made for it ,while gets good support from other actors too...lakeer Key Fakeer is not your stylish mafia flick were big glares and naked chicks dance around you...it's a story of pain and despair of a man who struggles to make his way out of there...believe Me folks ,ajaz khan is the next gen superstar....A bright future awaits him...!!"
