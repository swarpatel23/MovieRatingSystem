" I think I ate Raw Brinjal...again!","10 years ago as a fresher in my college I was made to eat raw Brinjal as a part of the ragging regime. I took two bites before I threw up and pretended I passed out, solely cause I couldn't muster the strength for another bite. It took me a while to get over that incident but eventually it was almost forgotten, until...Yesterday, when me and my friends planned to watch 'Khwaabb'. Every shot and every scene of the film brought back vivid memories of that raw Brinjal, only this time I was eating with my eyes and ears. Oh! That pain, that humiliation, that discomfort, that inhumanity. Every aspect of this film (acting, directing, plot) is so grotesque, you actually don't want to talk about it. It was as if I bought a damp match stick for the money I paid for this film. I hope they start a money return policy soon.People, this film is a decaying radioactive element. Stay away." 
" Modern Era Torture Device","The people behind this film are obvious sadists who like torturing innocent people. Unlike most of the medieval torture devices which slowly bled the victims to death, this film kills your brain cells frame by frame. The first 10 minutes of the film is basically the film challenging you to sit through it till finish and you accept it cause you put your hard earned money on it. But gradually as the film goes on you realize the more you watch it the worse you'll feel about the money spent on it. That's when you walk out of the theater. I did it after watching 30 minutes of this claptrap and watched 'Manjunath' instead. That sort of balanced it out." 
" Pretentious and Trashy!","I have never heard of this director before, but judging by the quality of his craft I'm assuming he's a schooler and this probably was his summer vacation project. This film is far from being an original; The story is a cheap ripoff of the regular run of the mill sports oriented films. However, this isn't the worst yet. What makes this film pretentious and trashy is the performances . It was as if random people (non actors) were picked up and given lines to say in front of the camera. There are parts (which sadly comprised most of the film) where it was actually difficult to look at the screen coz the performances was so painful to watch. There are films which are so bad they are fun to watch, for eg: Kanti Shah's Gunda, Ed Wood's Plan 9 etc. But this one is so bad it's just plain boring and painful to watch. I gave this film a 1 star because there is no option for 0." 
" Do not agree with other reviews","Film was uneasy in start with not so professionals dialogs but as story got built up its a nice movie with struggle of athletes, corruption in Sports department. It shows how will can overcome odds and it also scripts a tail of love where sacrifices are made and credit is given.Although a small budget film i feel this is worth a watch both the coaches and athletes have given good performance. Although initial half may not look so promising but final half will make a connect to the story.It also highlights the issue of single sport centric approach where only cricket is seen as real sports and other sports are not seen as brands by corporates who wish to advertise."
