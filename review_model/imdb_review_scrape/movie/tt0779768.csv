" IMDb saves a few people.","Usually, I can trust this website to have complete information on most things. In this case, however, IMDb seems to have nothing on this particular movie  which is a blessing in disguise for the makers of the movie, because it saves them some embarrassment. However, I am here to spoil all that.About a month ago, my wife and I decided to boycott partying every weekend and made our way to the cinema to watch the latest Hindi release "Teesri Aankh  The Hidden Camera". Since then, we have continued our partying ways.I visited this website the next morning to write my comments on the movie but could find no trace of this movie ever existing, until now, so I am here to write some comments.Teesri Aankh is an absolutely pathetic venture by loser director HARRY BAWEJA, where he pretends to expose the horrible effects experienced by women that get trapped in the porn ring. That's just an excuse to make this movie a flesh-fest, with clichéd dialogs and situations. Our cast is headed by Mr. Beef himself, SUNNY DEOL and his two leading ladies are AMISHA PATEL and NEHA DHUPIA. The former, as we have seen time and again, most notably in Mangal Pandey, has run out of reasons to continue in this industry. Whats makes it worse is that she's actually given a meaty role of a mute. The silver lining is that you don't hear her voice at all. But even her sign language is so annoying, you just want to tie her arms up. Our second leading lady is more of an extended special appearance, and her character is too dumb to understand that her 2 male agents (she plays a model) that are continuously ogling at her and looking up her skirt and down her bra, are eventually going to want to rape her.So she dies since her purity is so important to her, and her boyfriend Deol goes to London in search of her. He meets our mute friend who falls in love with him and helps him pursue his girlfriend's killers. So, most of the movie is shot in London, you would think. Ha! Every third scene takes the viewers to one of our characters (vile villains included) to a shot of them walking across Oxford street. And that's it. Even though the entire movie is supposedly taking place in London, the shooting isn't. Okay, maybe budgets were low, but could they have at least made the effort to make the place look like London.There's a fight scene in the night on an empty road, where Deol is smashing one of the sidey's head on a bus, and not only did they have an old, beat-up, Indian brand bus parked there, but it actually has yellow chameli garlands hanging in the windshield! Viewing of this movie can result in serious mental doubts about the state of Indian Cinema, so my advice is avoid unless your life depends on it. If you do watch it, and do survive the first half, my guess is the second will kill you. There's actually a scene where a villain across the road is running towards Sunny with a gun, and Sunny, seeing a nearby 4WD parked, kicks the car (YES  like a football, causing it to fly), which hits the villain who goes flying away. Wow, that is how you must take care of villains!You will have more fun tying and untying your shoe laces for 3 hours." 
" Super Flop of the year....","This is the worst film of the year. Coming from a director who has previously given us some fun movies (Diljale, Dilwale). Its a typical Sunny Deol movie, where he alone beats up 100s of guys. This is an example of Bollywood Stunts and action that ruin the Bollywood image that is trying to change. Bollywood tried to develop, but movies like this release and disgrace the whole method. One of the stunts in this movie include our hero Sunny deol (always popping from no where) kicking a moving car and the car goes flying away? The movie tries to have a serious storyline about a gang of indians in UK, who are involved in human trafficking and forced pornography. Even this serious storyline has been handled in a comically dafted way. The movie Stars the sexy Neha, who goes to UK and gets a photo taken of her nude, she then gets forced to make porn otherwise the photos will be published. Instead of going to the police, she accepts and tries to act like she's in a tough situation. (I mean, if she makes the films, that will too be broadcasted (Commen sense) but No) Neha fails to deliver a good performance. The movie also stars the very sexy Amisha Patel, whom also ruins the film with a unrealistic character. (She is running for her life by murderers and suddenly sneaks into a club and starts dancing. Her Face expressions change from scared to death to seductive dancing?) There's 100s more to say but I wont say no more.." 
" Awful rehash of Kalyug","Teesri Aankh is as clichéd and uncreative as Kalyug was innovative and profound. Teesri Aankh focuses on the same problem as Kalyug of the pornography underworld where illegal websites secretly videotape honeymooning couples and blatantly capture rapes. Kalyug has Kunal's intense performance, excellent songs, well-developed characters, and intricate storyline. Teesri Aankh has Sunny Deol pretty much narrating the whole story and lecturing the theme to the audience the entire movie. I think I need not even comment on his larger-than-life strength shown by picking up a motorcycle with one hand or kicking a van across the street. Amisha, as usual, gives an awful performance. Except for Jazzy B's foot-tapping number and Sharabi, songs are awful. The villains are shown to be the run-of-the-mill "gundaas/bad guys." Teesri Aankh is just a dreadful transformation from the intense, profound Kalyug to a typical, hackneyed Bollywood fare." 
" If you want to have a laugh watch this movie!","I wanted to see a Sunny Doel Movie a long time so decided i shall watch this. Never realised this action thriller is going to turn out a comedy! Firsty for someone who had a guest appearance,was in it more then anyone else. It was great to see Doel in Action again, though i think it went too far when in the climax of the scene he runs out of bullets in his pistol, and sees no way to get out of the situation then to throw his gun into the guy, Who Surprisingly, goes flying back! As for the previous guy who reviewed this and thought the scene where Doel kicks the Suzuki van into the villains was stupid... Thats a Doel for you, you have to realise that!! Harry Baweja must have been drunk out of his head when he made this film... I mean come on, Sunny Doel is telling Amisha Patel that he misses his Fiancé, cut to a song, then to a story in India that has nothing to do with him Dreaming about his fiancé.. Now what the hell was that about? Harry Baweja or anyone in the Bollywood Industry reading this who can pass this message on... Next time you want to make a film, ask for my advice!!! One plus thing about this movie is, that its not 3 hours long, Only 2hrs, though there are enough toilet breaks (songs) in between too.Hope this is useful..Lets hope the Doels are back with Anil Sharma's Apne!!" 
" serious movie turned funny","After taking one look at the cast, I knew what to expect from this movie and it truly delivered.If you are looking for a serious movie, stay away. If you are looking for a movie that is supposed to be serious but turns out to be comical, watch it.There were a lot of scenes in the movie (some of which are mentioned by other reviewers) that had me laughing out loud and the whole script had a lot of holes, which I also found amusing.The days when movies like this could pass as serious movies are long gone and it is sad to see that some directors and some actors have never really gone past the 90's, when movies like this were the bread and butter of bollywood." 
" Hilarious","Sunny Deol is become a joker now in films except some decent films here n there too few thoughThis film deals with a nice real story but is treated with the same clichés, done to deathI hoped the film will be a good film like KALYUG but it comes across as a poor effortThe film is a routine Sunny Deol film in all aspectsHe is supposedly in a guest appearance but is throughout the film? His eyes look puffed, his hair is horrendous and he looks old He does his usual shouting, talking slowly and uses his fists The stunts are so funny they make you cringe like Sunny kicks a car and it goes and bangs the goons lol and he catches 2 bike tires in his hand and throws them LOLThe film has the most clichéd villains like Mukesh Tiwari, Murli Sharma and Mukesh Rishi Amisha Patel plays a mute ala Rani in BLACK and she does an okay job at places but overdoes her expressions Aarthi Chabria is okay in a small role Ashish is bad Neha Dhupia is okay" 
" Below average!!","Teesri Aankh is a thriller with Sunny Deol as the hero. The movie has a novel plot based on a real life incident. However, there are a few things that should have been changed, like half of the stunts, which were poorly done. For example, there is a stunt in which Sunny kicks a van, and a special effect showed this van moving and knocking out 3 goons (Sunny SHOULD have just gone into the van, punch the window, and fire at the baddies), and another scene was in the climax, when a goon flies after being hit by a gun thrown by Sunny (Sunny SHOULD have just fired at that goon); these computer-generated flying goons are stupid. Also the special effects are idiotic and poor, even by our Bollywood standards. Sunny Deol is the real macho-man among macho stars in Bollywood, but he is not Superman or Incredible Hulk. He is a human being after all. Obviously, the stunt coordinator took Sunny's machismo for granted to make him look bad. Sunny should have either told the coordinator to make realistic stunts or just walk out of the movie. These stunts should have been changed to something sensible instead of stupid, but this stunt coordinator is a moron and incompetent. He is at a big fault in this regard. What in the world was he even thinking?!?! I mean, who in their right state of mind would even come up with stupidity like this (kicking a car or create flying computer-generated goons). Very unimaginable and very stupid! DISGRACEFUL! This movie looked incomplete in this regard! If this was a science fiction movie, like Terminator, then it would have been justified, but here, it is NOT even that. The director should have used common sense to tell the stunt coordinator to come up with realistic stunts; or even better, he should have just hired a more competent and skillful stunt coordinator to come up with some sensible, realistic stunts because the one he hired has no skill. How could the director even allow such stupidity?!?! Alongside the dumb special effects, which ruined some of the action in this film, another reason why this movie flopped was because it was a delayed release, as it was supposed to release in late '05. Apart from this, the villains are made to look like sick buffoons, but Sunny is the only street smart character in this film. This could have been much better!! One idiot wrote that he would highly recommend this film with good action. He must be blind. Even though times are changing, but for action films, the action scenes still need to look realistic and well-developed with effort; slacking off does NOT work at all, and exaggeration only ruins the action and makes it less enjoyable and sometimes more ridiculous (depending how far overboard one goes). See the following link to prove this point in this regard. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/353918.cms" 
" Bollywood's answer to Action films.","People have criticized this film for not being realistic enough in its action, but let's look at what we call "Realistic" action films- The Matrix? Mission Impossible Three? Simply put, realistic action movies don't exist like they used too. Calling this movie out because of it's action is ultimately hypocritical. On to the movie!The movie starts out fairly slowly, the story doesn't seem to want to pick up for a bit, but that's OK- the movie is so filled with action that it doesn't need to pick up right away. The movie may start out as a crawl, but it ends in a full out sprint! Sunny Deol plays ACP Arjun Singh, a man who stands out for not being corruptible, a patriotic fighter of justice, who never asks pointless questions. Amisha Patel stands out playing the mute Ammu, a girl who witnesses a horrible event, but cannot fully explain the atrocities that she has seen.Overall, this movie delivers exactly where it's said to deliver- the action- the fight scenes are extremely well crafted, although not entirely realistic, the stunts are so over the top and extreme, that you don't care about the unrealistic action in the movie, and only watches the amazing scenes in front of you!Finally, the music is actually quite good- The songs Titliyan Titliyan and Jazzy B's Chuk de Punjabi will be stuck in your head days after you see this movie. I highly recommend this movie!!"
