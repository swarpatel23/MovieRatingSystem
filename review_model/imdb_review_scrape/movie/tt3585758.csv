" Kahin Hai Mera Pyar","This movie has a good story having reference to Bible mythology of Adam and Eve explaining search for love since the formation of universe. Story revolves around lead actor Karan, who is trying to search his love that he paints from his imagination. Sanjay Kapoor knows about that girl and try to impress her but fails to get love and unknowingly becomes a medium to have them meet and then-after he could not separate love pair and looses his control on emotions. Alla Tala song by Sanjay Kapoor is really impressive, where he accuses god for making him so obsessive, this song by Kailash Kher could be in his best of songs. Audience thinks it as love triangle but climax is different and interesting. Jackie Shroff plays a cameo supporting Karan come out of crisis and helps make first half of movie watchful. Movie should be seen for good concept, acting and visual effects."
