" Thriller or comedy- What do I call this?","IS this film a thriller , love story or a comedy? What do I call it? Story is about an efficient hit-man who takes on the contract of abducting an eyewitness who has seen a murder and has got a disc with vital government info, and bring him back to Mumbai. He soon finds himself protecting the boy and the latter's newfound girlfriend instead, and fighting the people who sent him in the first place.The good - Some action scenes, especially at the climax, and the music. The portrayal of Suniel Shetty as a "no-nonsense only business" hit-man is also good.That is all. It's the only reason why I gave the film 5 stars out of 10.The bad- boring comedy...plenty of that throughout the movie. It spoils the very essence of a film that is meant to be an action thriller. It's like excess salt in a dish. Serious stuff, then comedy, then romance, then again some action. Goes on like that.I am sure this film would not have run. You can't even watch it at home more than once."
