" How do I abhor thee?","....let me count the ways.**Those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, please don't watch it. Those of you who have seen this already, we can all just hold hands and mourn the collective incineration of our brains.Double Dhamaal was sheer torture - the kind that makes you want to blow your head off just to end the pain, the kind that made me want to claw out my newly-lasiked eyes just so I wouldn't see any more, the kind that makes you want to scream and leave the theater at a quick gallop.Lets not talk about audience reactions anymore...lets talk about the movie. Not much to say - honestly kindergarten babies can do a better job than the bunch of overpaid overacting buffoons in this movie. Everyone, from Arshad Warsi to Sanjay Dutt to the nameless goon who waves a gun around, is a complete waste of time. Hell...the entire movie is a complete waste of time. And writing any more about it would be a waste of MY time.** Apologies to Elizabeth Barrett Browning" 
" not a worth watching movie","It is a stupid movie...... old stuff.... age old... do not provide a good laugh... Story : The gang of Dhamaal -- Adi (Arshad Warsi), Manav (Jaaved Jafri), Boman (Ashish Chowdhury), Roy (Riteish Deshmukh) are back. Once again they have just one purpose in life: to get rich, any which way. This time the plan entails duping their tormentor Kabir (Sanjay Dutt) by messing up his personal and professional life. bogus movie... had very high expectation but i must say after watching first show that i have wasted my time and money. my advice do not watch this movie in cinema halls... wait for the television premier. went to cinema by listening to people that this is not worth half of DHAMAAL.... but still went with a hope.... but its a time waste..!!! do not watch...!!!" 
" Oh my lord!!!","Short review: this is the biggest pile of manure that I have ever seen, ranking right down there with some of the worst films in cinema history.Long review: pretty much the same as the short review, with way more words to convey how awful it is.First up, this was supposed to be a comedy, right? I only ask as it is anything but funny. Two odd hours long and seriously there is not a single laugh in the whole film. Perhaps they were aiming at a spoof-style of film but missed the mark completely? Quite where to start with the awfulness is hard to determine, it is that bad across the board.The script is pretty atrocious, clich√©d to within an inch of its life, lacking any sort of originality whatsoever. It didn't even manage to rip off any decent scenes from any other similar sorts of films in an effort to at least try and lift itself out of the mire.This of course meant that the actors had little to work with but that hardly excuses the atrociousness of the performances given here. If this is the best script that Sanjay Dutt can get to work with, we can pretty much accept that his career has well and truly gone down the toilet big time. His performance was about D-grade at best and pretty much laughable. Seriously, he needs to retire if this is the best he can do. As for the rest? Oh my lord, they must have been desperate for a pay check. All the main cast were woeful, putting in appalling performances of the highest order. At times they descended to outright vomit-inducing degrees of ineptitude and offensiveness.One can only presume that this was at the instruction of the director as surely no self-respecting actor would descend to the level of awfulness seen here. Indra Kumar does not have much of a filmography as a director after 21 years and on the evidence of this film it is obvious why - there is nothing on earth that would induce me to watch another film done by him. Yes, this one is that bad.On the positive side of things, cinematography wasn't bad, editing was reasonable and the film looks great.A truly, truly awful film. Should be avoided at all costs unless you feel the need to be reduced to a state of depression. On the evidence here, depression is what Indian cinema is in if this sort of tripe can get made." 
" Nothing Close To The original","The original Dhamaal was a rip off from an assortment of Hollywood releases but still it was one of the best comedies i have seen.Double Dhamaal is simply another worthless & disappointing sequel like Bheja Fry 2.In this installment the idiot foursome is back and try to take revenge against Kabir(Sanjay Dutt)as now he is a rich conman.The plot moves from India to Macau in the second half without any improvement.The jokes & gags get repetitive and the chemistry between the leads is missing which made Dhamaal such fun.Javed Jaffrey is funny in parts while Ashish Chaudhury is simply irritating to watch.The other two leads Arshad & Riteish had been doing these same stupid roles from the onset of their careers and sleepwalk through their roles.Sanjay Dutt looks lost while seeing Kangana & Mallika act we realize why there weren't any female leads in the original Dhamaal.It would have been much better had they only been used for the item numbers.In short the cinematography,music,plot has got nothing new to offer & though there are some funny moments they are few & far in between so at more than two hours it gets bland & boring.Avoid this if you value your time & only if you are desperate to watch it rent a DVD." 
" No Double Dhammal ,But A Double Torture !","CAUTION: When you are about to watch this film please don't forget to take a headache tablet. Yes I am not kidding mate. Just one word describes the film in short- "Torture". Pathetic film with bad humor and a rubbish storyline. Too much of mimicry that doesn't connect with the audiences. On the contrary they get bugged watching when it gets repeated again and again. Utter nonsense story . On the plus side lies Satish Kaushik . You,ll definitely enjoy his presence in the film. The first half of the film does include a few scenes that are enjoyable.But post interval is fully on the negative side. Bringing gorillas in between makes matter more worse. Stupidity personified. Talking about the performances, Javed is good,Ritesh is silly,Ashish and Arshad are average. Sanjay Dutt- The biggest disappointment of the film. Another factor that doesn't click is the music of the film. I,ll go for 3 out of 10. Watch Dhammal 1 again instead of watching this one. I bet u,ll enjoy that rather than this silly film." 
" There is nothing double in here but somebody please stop these unequal sequels. (Review By Bobby Sing)","After watching this comic sequel from Indra Kumar, the man who has excelled himself in drama and overdoing things, I had a Deja-Vu kind of the feeling since the experience was pretty much same to that of watching 'Bheja Fry 2' last week. In other words, here too, where the first part was hugely successful due to its copied status taking sequences directly from its various sources, the second part is not anywhere close to that, making an effort to be an original. But on the other hand, the film is not a complete loser and still manages to entertain you in bits and parts.Taking off from the concluding scenes of DHAMAAL, it revolves around a story in which all the characters try to fool each other with their own planned con-acts. Needless to say that it's a loud and absurd kind of comedy based on some weird but comic writing, made with a single aim to make you laugh. And I really don't mind watching these kinds of movies leaving my brains at home. But, only if they are capable enough to keep me engaged thoroughly with their entertaining inputs. Sadly that's where DOUBLE DHAMAAL falls short and further with a completely no show by Sanjay Dutt (the main magnetic pull in the movie), one walks out felling less served than promised in its promos.At times the jokes and one liners work well even when they are ridiculously written with double meanings, full of foul language, even featuring Gorillas swinging to a Bollywood Song kissing each other. But the actors, deliver these dialogues in such a way that you don't mind laughing at them whole heartedly, particularly in the sequences featuring the four friends together on the screen. Post interval the pace keeps dropping at various places with some boring and unwanted songs except "Jalebi Bai" which both has a melody and visual value incorporated in it. But other than that it's a completely uninspiring musical score from Anand Raaj Anand, who has returned after a long gap. Visually the film is better than its first part DHAMAAL and Cinematography works fine both in local and foreign locations. The script keeps adding new twists and turns in the story-plot generating more spaces of laughter regularly. Still, somehow the continuous entertaining value is missing in the film and there seems to be an overdose of everything, which as a result leaves you less satisfied in the end. Moreover the film ends quite abruptly and the director looks like so over-confident of his product that he clearly leaves a message indicating towards its third part.In few words, the best part of the film remains its four Jokers along with Satish Kaushik returning to his old form after a long time. Obviously the best of the four remain Arshad Warsi and Ritesh Deshmukh as per their star status. But this time Ritesh is better than everyone in the film coming up with a superb performance followed by Arshad Warsi with his impeccable timing. However, Arshad posing as a funny Sardar in the second half once again takes the community for a ride which should ideally be a matter of concern for the community leaders. Both Aashish & Javed Jaffery play their roles brilliantly but I felt Javed having a less impactful role than in DHAMAAL. Apart from these four Jokers the next surprise joker is Satish Kaushik who is a treat to watch as the Bhai speaking some hilarious dialogues in the first half, but at the same time Zakhir Hussain as the second Bhai gets wasted.The biggest disappointment in the movie remains Sanjay Dutt who surprisingly doesn't have a completely comic role in the film as the con-man accompanied by the two ladies. And I really missed watching Sanjay participating in few comedy scenes with the four fools. Mallika Sherawat as Sanjay's lover is just perfect but Kangna looks like a misfit in her role as she tries too hard to bring in some laughs on her own.Summing up, I can surely say that there is nothing DOUBLE in here in this new DHAMAAL and few may find it even less enjoyable than its original one. Still it can be watched once for its performances by the five jokers (including Satish) but somebody please stop this mad trend of making sequels which don't really justify their own set standards in the past." 
" a good example of a bad film","horrible movie.i wonder how i managed to stick for 2 hrs 15 min.but there was nothing to offer in this flick. thejokes were rubbish,the plot ,iwonder if there was one. and the worst part of the movie,they scare in the end for the next part.this one was equally bad as the first one was good.so my recommendations don't go for it.it will definitely bound to give you a headache. Talking of performances... the most disappointing was kangana ranaut...it was as if she was picked from some roadside and pushed to act...mallika shehrawat as usual had nothing to offer. sanjay dutt's acting was lame... even riteish deshmukh was a big disappointment. sp i would conclude that this movie is a perfect mixture of bad script worse direction and awful acting...so if u want to see how bad a film can be go for it ....else look out for something else" 
" Sanjay Dutt was great, but movie disappointing","The movie had bland and clich√©d jokes, the mimicry had nothing new, story was plain flat. Sanjay dutt and kangna gave some good performances, and had good expressions, rest of the cast, a total disappointment.As soon as the movie started it was obvious that the story line is going to be absolutely ridiculous, and lo behold it was, One this is also obvious Mallika sherawat is only good with her cheap dances and not made for real acting, her acting is sheepish and totally unconvincing. We do understand that comedies need to be entertaining, but they need to give us at least a believable story which has a tiny bit of common sense. Disappointment" 
" Rubbish","Double Dhamaal is one of worst movies of 2011. I enjoyed the original but this movie is total torture.Story - There is total mess of a story. In fact there is no story at all. It is mixture of stupid gags, nonsense and plain nonsense. First half had some scenes that make you laugh but second half is extremely horrible with no logic at all.Performances - Sanjay Dutt disappoints. The 4 some are okay (well the imitating scenes are more irritating than funny). Mallika Sherawat and Kangana Ranaut are also bad. Kangana Ranaut is most irritating of all actors. Satish Kaushik is great in his small role and his scenes are best in movie. Rest all pass muster.Music - Music is not up to mark at all. Except Jalebi Bai there is nothing worth remembering.Double Dhamaal is rubbish movie and i gave it 2/10 only for some funny scenes in first half" 
" Double Dhammal is NOT a Double Dhammal","Double Dhammal ==============Director :Indra Kumar Music :Anand Raj Anand Starring : Sanjay Dutt, Ritesh Deshmukh, Arshad Warsi, Javed Jaffery, Ashish Choudhary, Kangna Ranaut and Mallika Sherawat.Movie Review : 2 Star : Double Dhaamal is NOT Double Dhamaal. ============the 1st part was executed much better. There are some scenes that make you laugh . But most of the other comedy scenes are double meaning and are loud. There is no new treatment given to the movie.Indra Kumar was top of the directory during 80's and 90's with his hits like Beta , Dil , Ishq . expectations were high but it didn't worked out in his favor.Aanand Raj Aanand has given good music. Even he is one of the popular music directors from the 80' 90's like TridevMusic Review : 3 star : Music is Good . There are some songs which will be diffidently played by DJ's . Good dance numbers. ============My Fav Pick are :1. Chak Kudiye by Mikka : Rap and a mixture of Bhangra. 2. Jalebi Bai : Item number by Mallika . everyone is going to compare Jalebi bai with other item number songs like Sheela and munni songs.There are total of 4 songs1. Chal Kudie : **** ( 4 star ) Anand Raj Anand & Mika Singh2. Chal Kudie (Remix): ** ( 2 star ) Anand Raj Anand & Mika Singh3.Chill Maro **** ( 4 star ) Mika Singh4.Chill Maro (Remix) **( 2 star ) Mika Singh5.Jalebi Bai **** ( 4 star ) Ritu Pathak6.Oye Oye **( 2 star ) Sunidhi Chauhan7.Oye Oye Remix * ( 1 star ) Sunidhi ChauhanMore information : Don't miss out the 1st part "Dhammal" (2007) also directed by the same directory Indra kumar .Other Movies directed by Indra Kumar : Beta , Ishq , Dil Music directed by Aanand Raj aanand in other movies : Tridev , Kaante, Major Saab , Musafir , Kaal , no problems etc" 
" Lacks the magic of its prequel,but this is better than the recent comedies at least!","Just saw Double Dhamaal in Bahrain.Double Dhamaal directed by Indra Kumar is hilarious.For Double Dhamaal,I did not search for logic or story instead just a few jokes and the outcome WAS really outstanding.Double Dhamaal lacks the magic of its prequel Dhamaal,but sure it is better than the recent comedies.Yes,Double Dhamaal might be loud but at the same time it is humorous.Talking about the story,it is okay.The screenplay is penned very well.The comedy here is excellent.The dialogs are smart.The music is average.Performances-Ritesh,Arshad,Ashish and Javed are excellent in their respective roles.Ritesh Deshmukh is too good as Roy.Arshad Warsi stands out as Adi.Ashish Chaudary is funny as Boman and Javed Jaffery shines as Manav.Sanjay Dutt is revelation.Mallika and Kangana act very well.Mallika looks bewitching in "Jalebi Bai" and acts very well.Kangana Ranaut is very good and she has shown improvement in her diction,which is good.Satish Kaushik in a cameo rocks as Bata Bhai.He is so funny.Zakir Hussain is average.On the whole Double Dhamaal is excellent entertainer and one of the best comedies to come in the recent years." 
" Double Dhamaal is fast and brightly coloured but ultimately too exhausting and too frantically silly to impress the whole family","I really hoped this would tickle my funny bone, thanks to the critical and commercial success of the 1st film Dhamaal (2007) which truly deserved a sequel, however, this falls a bit short of even a decent sequel. Rather than double comedy it was barely more than half entertaining. Like most film sequels, Double Dhamaal ("Dhamaal 2") takes it's predecessor 2007 Bollywood comedy film Dhamaal's basic story frame/template and tries to expand on it and tries to make it bigger by adding new ideas for con-acts, new places like in Macau and Homg Kong, China (overseas) and new supporting characters. Although it is fast and brightly colored (more colorful as seen on the release poster and comedic) to impress and entertain the Dhamaal fans, it is too frantically silly to entertain the whole family. It is low on freshly squeezed comedic energy and also reliant on slapstick humour. Several of the comedy acts and jokes and lines are recycled from the first film. The film should also elaborate on how exactly the four friends found the disguise costumes and how they switch in and out. (Did they buy them from a clothing story with the money they had or dd they ambush someone in an alley and strip them of their clothes, kill the person and put on their clothing or did they shoplift?) Overall, Double Dhamaal isn't really Dhamaal 2. The plot seems to be thin at times and gets boring and tedious and confusing. It's Double Trouble. Arshad, Aashish, Ritesh and Javed are good as the four friends as well as Sanjay as Kabir. However, I felt that Kamini, Kiya and Mohisn Bhai's roles were unnecessary. But Bata Bhai rocks as a part time illegal don/gangster. The beginning of the film where it takes off right after Dhamaal ends as well as the Devil's Bar comedy scene is funny but that's not enough to save this movie. You're better off watching the 1st 2007 film. My review: 2.5/5. I just hope Total Dhamaal is way better." 
" Double Dhamaal - A worthy sequel","I have been a little disappointed in the past with sequels to comedies; that include Hangover 2 and Bheja Fry 2. They problem with some has been the utter similarity to earlier part or complete disparity. Double dhamaal has retained the continuity and still has a difference and fresh view, and that makes it better sequel. Story takes up from where the first movie ended. Some reviews say that first movie was better and this one is totally different and thus a drag on the franchise. I say that if it had been a similar story, like in Hangover 2, same reviewers would have then disregarded this movie as a total rip. The plot, although shallow, is the logical extension to the earlier started story. And no one promised that it was to be an intellect's movie. If you are OK with Singh is King(No similarity) then what is wrong with this plot. Everyone has done a good job at portraying the characters. One problem with the screenplay is Sanjay Dutt's absence in comedy scenes; or maybe thats the scriptwriter's issue. Sanjay Dutt has portrayed the ever winning con-man and has close to zero screen time in comedy scenes. Baman(Ashish) has done a great job at playing a sleazy, nymphomaniac girl. Movie does not have as much skin-show as one would expect thanks to Mallika. The item song "Jalebi Bai" is the only time that you get to see the Mallika as what people pay to come watch her for. Kangna has improved a bit after Tanu weds Manu though she has little to do. Her role is dispensable and she serves as just eye candy and in a couple of situations a center piece. Although the last quarter of the movie is a bit dragging, with oodles of wisecracks this sequel will give you a lot of funny moments." 
" Why?","Why? The first question popped in my mind, why they made this movie. No story, no real comedy, no fun, no creativity. They have wasted Arshad Warsi, who can really give a better performance (like Munnabhai). Ritesh D. also not impressive here. I really doubt whether director was there while the shooting is done.The movie starts with a song as 10 other movies of this type ... and never takes the grip. The film is pathetic and insensible storyline. It has bad humor which will not make you laugh. I will not recommend to watch this movie. Please watch some other movie twice instead of wasting time on this one." 
" Dud Dhamaal","The makers taking cue from "Munnabhai" and "Golmaal" could have taken forward "Dhamaal" as a franchise instead of an sequel for better creative and revenue proposition. The good news is the new "Dhamaal" has good moments in terms of fresh gags, comic timings and situational comedy. The four jokers namely Ritesh D, Arshad W, Javed F and Aashish C are usual reliable, dependable. Kangana tries her hand at comedy and does a fair job. Mallika joins the bandwagon and is not too bad either considering she does "Sheela meets Munni" in an attempt to create item song of 2011 with "Jalebi Bai". Sanjay Baba is as usual, in form. Romantic track between Ritesh & Kangana lacks chemistry. Sanjay & Mallika's track is nonchalant. Aashish C makeover is detesting. Javed J brings in a few original one-liners. Zakir Hussain presence can be timed in seconds. There is only song which stands out, rest are passable. In the second half, the flow loses steam and better writing was warranted. Verdict: "Dhamaal" was certainly few notches above. The audience expected a sequel to surpass the previous outing and sadly "Double Dhamaal" fails miserably." 
" Crass","Double Dhamaal is rubbish. The movie is disgusting and obscene at times and there are too few jokes that make you laugh out loud.It is no match to its predecessor. The first movie was brilliant with great acting by all four i.e. Arshad Warsi, Asish Choudhary, Ritesih Deshmukh and Javed Jaffery. It also had a fantastic performance by Asrani as Asish's father.Double Dhamaal tries very hard but falls flat. Their is also a line at the end of the movie where Roy says that they (the gang) will take revenge from Kabir(Sanjay Dutt) in the next part Total Dhamaal. I hope they don't make it.Also what was KanganaRanaut doing in the film?I really had great expectations from this movie but it is totally not worth wasting your money. Watch it on TV instead."
