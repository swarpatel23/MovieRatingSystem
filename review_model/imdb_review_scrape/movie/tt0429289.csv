" they were searching a new way to show vulgarity to viewers","There is enough vulgarity in some of the Indian movies.And the producer of the movie was just searching for a new way to show this.They found a lot of such scope in the story,which is as follows-A teenager founds his new neighbor quite sexy,tries to spend more and more time with her.The girl is transplanted there by a servant of the boy's father.One night the girl allows the boy to come into her bad,and gives a lot of whiskey to the boy.When the boy wakes up,he finds that the girl is dead.He thinks the girl died due to the mating.He feels sorry and goes to the servant to make plea of saving him.They dispose the body,and the servant cunningly takes some photographs of the while disposing.Servant shows the photographs to boy and says that the blackmailer is asking a large sum.The boys gives it.One day the boy finds that the girl is actually alive,and the rest of the story is describing how the boy comes out of all these ill-happenings.But what is the notable point?It's that the girl is of 25 and the boy is of 15.Isn't it is a new way.A quite large part of the movie is such that teenagers should not see,and the ending is fully childish.So,what was the aim of making this movie?The movie was a great failure at the box office also.Thank GOD such low budget movies are not finding their way in overseas territories of bollywood.Otherwise the little bit of praise,which bollywood earned recently,will be no more.Don't ever watch this movie.The worst and vulgar scenes of this movie are not going to make you feel happy." 
" Two sexy Girls in a lame movie","Tauba Tauba is no doubt a Daft movie which Flopped big time in the box office. It is a copy of a European film i saw long time ago on TV. I don't recall the name of the movie, but it stars Syvia Kristal. The movie lacks almost everything from bad acting to bad script. The only good thing about this movie are the two very sexy actresses. Payal Rohatgi is a sexy actress, who is forced to seduce the 15 year old kid. Monalisa (A.K.A. Antra Biswas) is the second actress in this movie, playing the love of the comic and lousy villain. Monalisa is incredibly sexy, with a cute face and a perfect body. In my opinion, Monalisa is one of the most sexiest actresses in Bollywood. (If i had a chance to meet any actresses, it would be her). She is a Star in South India, but hasn't made much Bollywood films, mainly because her acting isn't Superb and her voice (is cute, but doesn't suit. Tauba tauba is suppose to be a sex comedy, it does contain a few jokes. As for sex, there are plenty of steamy scenes and a small scene with Monalisa that was edited out. You can see this scene on the trailer, but its not on the DVD sadly. If i had the chance (Director/Producers Chair), i would have a three some with Monalisa and Payal Rohatgi. Oh Yes a lovely sandwich that would be."
