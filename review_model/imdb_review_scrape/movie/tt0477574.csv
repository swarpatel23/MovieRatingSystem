" Nothing Works","Bengal Tiger Directed By Adarsh Jain is An Action Crime Drama. Direction, Screenplay & Script Are Poor. Acting is Pathetic By Shakti Kapoor & Most Of The Cast. Nothing New Same Old Revenge Story With Different Skin.Inspector Prasant Verma(Mithun) is Transferred To Virar Police Station. He Comes to Know About Framed Suicide Of Inspector Durga Who Was Burnt Alive By Wishwa Mohan (Ali Khan). Prasant Had A Past Where Her Sister Was Killed By Wishwa Mohan, Sultan(Pramod Moutho) & Rukawat Singh(Shakti Kapoor). Prasant Creates Rift Between The Three. And Kills Wishwa Mohan. After Leaning About Prashant Intentions Rukawat Singh & Sultan Join Hands To Tackle Prashant.Love Subplot Between Sandeep & Vinitha Looks Forced. Songs Are Pathetic. They Are Added Without Meaning. Nothing Works."
