" Pitiful","I was actually disappointed in this movie. It was suppose to be one of those films, from the previews etc., that was liberal and accepting and opening new doors in Bollywood cinema...it was everything but that!This is one of the most closed minded films I've ever seen. The promos and previews give off the impression that this film is applauding homosexuality, but it isn't. It's actually a extremely conservative film, that contradicts all of its promotional items. As a young person in the new generation, who is a free thinker, it's very disappointing, to see one's culture come farther and farther and more accepting to the new ways of the world, only to be shot down by a film like this.I am not homosexual, but I have friends that are, and this film could be considered offensive if anything. Offensive, without reasonable doubt, and no redeeming quality, as other one-sided/racist/supremist/conservative etc. films have -- i.e, American History X, Fire, The Believer etc.Spoilers...."Girlfriend" makes homosexuality out to be a bad thing. These people didn't choose to become this way, it just happened, and this film treats it like they are a spick of dirt that should be killed -- as is Isha's character, who is also clinically insane in the film, is.But if we must compare it to other Indian controversial films, let's compare it to Kya Kehna with Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta. Boy flirts with girl, Girl flirts with boy, Boy and girl have sex before marriage, Girl gets Pregnant without being married...The different between these two films is that in 'Kya' in the end Preity's character, talks about the fact, that when a baby is born in wedlock it's a gift from god, but when it's born out of wedlock it's treated like a rotten tooth in society. Babies didn't ask to be placed on this earth, so why should they suffer, and is her baby actually some sort of rotten tooth? Of course not and we get a happy ending.In Girlfriend, lesbianism is denounced, degraded and then the Lesbian in the film, is killed because she's insane.This movie really DOES NOT have steamy scenes, they don't exist, it's all in the promos. Indian films with steamy scenes -- check "Jism" , that is what Indian cinema is scared of. I remember seeing articles about protesters protesting "Girlfriend" and burning the posters. I found it amusing because, after viewing the film, Lesbians should be burning the posters because it makes them look bad. The film is extremely tame and pretty pitiful. I give it a 3 -- Amrita, Scenes and I feel sorry for it.A better movie in the same general area -- "Fire," "Earth," "Jism," "Touch of Pink"." 
" According to Razdan, Lesbianism Is A Result Of Childhood Sexual Abuse...","Karan Razdan is known for his B-grade films. 'Girlfriend' was one of his attempts to make it into the big league. At that time, skin-show flicks were the trend. If it weren't for the casting of actress Ishaa Koppikar, this would have been just another forgettable B-grader. The direction is sloppy and the writing is pathetic. 'Girlfriend' is offensive to homosexuals and women. The characterization is atrocious. Apparently, according to Razdan, a lesbian is a woman who has been molested as a child and as a result of that, is only sexually attracted to women, and hates anything that has a penis. Continuing by Razdan's logic, a lesbian's girlfriend is pretty much just a pushover repressed woman who sleeps with said lesbian only because she hasn't found the idiot penis who would hit on her with cheesy lines and marry her. Surprise, surprise, the boyfriend turns out to be a neurotic and possessive homophobic git. Oh, and I cannot even find the right words to describe how homosexual men have been portrayed here. The supposed love scene with Koppikar and Arora is so lousily shot that it's laughable rather than erotic. It's funny how the movie tries to make Isha's Tanya the hateful villain but the viewer ends up liking her more than the two other idiots. Special mention goes to the background noise, I mean score, that spoonfeeds the viewer and turns this into a soap opera. Performancewise, only Isha Koppikar stands out as the strong and dominant Tanya while everyone else is ridiculously bad. Not to worry because the badness does inadvertently provide some humour." 
" Movie with highly explicit scenes!","Thia is not an Ideal Indian Drama.It contains very graphic scenes as it deals sensitive issues like lesbians very casually. The films revolves around two girl friends. They cross the limits of alike sex relationships and started loving each other at the limit of lovers. One of the girl fall in love with a guy but this sparks an element of jealousy in her girlfriend.There is no practical angle given to the film it's just lust of same sex living beings with lots of steamy scenes.Indian audiences would certainly like the allowed pornographic material but would be tired of watching this baseless, senseless movie even once.No chance of watching it with the family or even with your Girlfriend. In conclusion this movie fails to recognize and reflect the true essence of same sex relationships.This movies not only faced aggressive actions from Indian Hindu Hardliners but also from Gay and Lesbian Community. However, amongst all this controversy the film is assumed to do fine business and get the money back with some profits." 
" Ridiculous and utterly offensive to LGBT+ people","While I can appreciate how daring it is to address homosexuality at all in Hindi cinema, this particular film addresses it in a way that is not helpful to the LGBT+ community at all. It's actually damaging.'Girlfriend' doesn't treat the topic (what it's like to be homosexual in India) anywhere near seriously enough, and it portrays homosexuals in a terrible light. Tanya is obsessive, and she promotes the toxic ideas that (a) lesbians are simply 'man haters', (b) that you have to have experienced some kind of 'trauma' to 'become' a lesbian, and (c) that homosexuality is some sort of evil that must be purged. In addition to that - though the latter is definitely my main criticism of the film - Rahul and Sapna's relationship makes absolutely no sense. Tanya may be a terrible person, but he is too. He pretends to be gay to 'get closer' to Sapna, whose initial reaction is appropriate, but somehow comes to find this ploy of his charming... which is absolutely ludicrous.The political controversy caused by this film is ridiculous enough because homophobes are just that: ridiculous. The LGBT+ community, however, has every reason to be outraged by 'Girlfriend'. This film is an insult." 
" Could be better","The film had a new theme of lesbianism which was promoted too as a sex sleazy film however the handling of the subject is very rudimentary. The film starts off as a normal romcom with 4-5 songs and then slowly we are glued to the screen but the film has several issues like child abuse being a reason for turning into a lesbian is far from convincing, Also the handling at times is too old fashioned.Direction by Karan Razdan is average Music is decentIsha Koppikar excels in her role which was difficult to play,Amrita Arora is not a great actress and is okay, Ashish Chaudhary overacts in many scenes, Sumit Niljhawan has a cameo and he is odd rest are okay" 
" Different Side of The Coin Of Love","This movie could have been made better if it was about straight oriented people,overall its a fast paced entertaining thriller with nice songs thrilling dialogues fabulous performances & exotic mauritius locals,but the weakest point of This Film is The issue it tackles about of "lesbianism",film makers should never highlight these kind of subjects which can harm the human culture,possessive love triangles look good on hetrosexuals not on homosexuals & thats the only awful thing in movie Girlfriend,otherwise as for the entertainment value it has no faults,writer-director Karan Razdan has padded this movie with several intense moments which make certain thrills to its viewers. The sequences between Isha and Aashish are the hallmark of the enterprise. Their verbal confrontations/duels at regular intervals maintains a strong hold on the viewer.as for The Performances Isha koppikar is Very Nice in Her Strong Obsessive Act,Amrita Arora is so so, But The Real Scene Stealer is My Favourite Regal Handsome Hunk Ashish Chowdhry,Ashish has done Fabulous Act as a Guy who is against The Lesbianism & Having The Fight to Finish against one Girl to Win Another Girl,Ashish's Gorgeous Appearance Mindblowing Sex Appeal Excellent Acting & Marvellous Dialogue Delivery are Awesome,if there wouldn't be a Superb Talented Extremely Goodlooking Actor Like Ashish in This Film This Movie Would Look Life a Forgettable B Grader,Its Only Ashish Who Saved its Environment. Final Verdict: if u wanna watch this movie please don't take its subject seriously,think its only a showreel not a reality." 
" SPOILER - A very different film","For the first time, I don't know how to react to a movie. I don't know if I liked it or not. There definitely were a couple of explicit scenes. Songs were good, particularly "Bheegi Bheegi." Isha and Amrita were excellent choices for their roles.(Warning: The following might be a SPOILER.)Having created extreme controversy and violence in India, I was expecting this film to be shedding light on a lesbian relationship. However, being one of the first Hindi films to take a look at homosexuality, it seemed to label homosexuality as a sin, an evil, and say that only psychopaths are lesbians. I don't know; maybe I misinterpreted the theme of the movie. Anyways, I hope I haven't offended anyone with my remarks on homosexuality; if I did, I'm sorry." 
" Different movie, worth watching.","If one is looking for typical Bollywood fare or cannot handle atypical sexuality, stay away from this movie.The movie certainly lacks in many ways: the acting was average at best. Isha Koppikar (Tanya) overdoes it, Amrita Arora (Sapna)is barely believable, and Aashish Chaudhary does what he could to support them. Some scenes such as Tanya's 'Matrix' style fights were pathetic and laughable. The music was fair, but the sceneries (including the human scenes) were delightful! Isha is very pleasing to the eyes in this movie, and I hear that Chaudhary excited his female viewers too. There were a few 'hot' scenes, very suggestive, very fleshy, but no explicit sex, no lip to lip meets.The movie touches on a few social issues. Why did Tanya become the man-hater that she was? Is this a current issue in India? From what I have been hearing, very much so! The movie certainly explained why she became a man hater, but I have trouble believing that the movie suggests that it was the direct reason for her lesbian leaning. I can more accept that it led to her psychopathic behaviour. If it was an attempt to explore homosexuality, it failed; but it successfully said that homosexualism was a part of the social fabric of sex tabooed India, the land that gave us the Kama Sutra and the Tantras... whether we like it or not.Apart from the lesbian lover element and 'hot scenes', it is a straightforward love triangle story.If you are the conservative type and are overburdened by too much sexual taboo, this movie is not for you. For the others... it is a good watch. Then wonder why the din, the protests. Then have a good laugh... twice the entertainment on a single billing."
