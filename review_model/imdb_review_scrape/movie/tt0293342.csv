" Lajja lives upto expectations...","I had been really apprehensive with all the hype suroounding this flick. I have seen mixed to great reviews and was wondering how it will balance so many actors in 3 hour 5 minutes. I was pleasantly surprised. Every actor had their shining moment. Regardless of the length of their individual roles, every character was well defined and performed well. The movie is definitely flawed especially the climax. What the hell was RKS thinking with ladies throwing chappal sequence at Danny at the end -absolutely cliche and a crap idea. "Back to NewYork" at the end was a terrible idea as well. But I did like Santoshi's handling throughout of drama and comedy blend. He has said the movie he made should entertain - if he hadn't approached the subject as such he would have made a very depressing high budget art movie specially with Ramdulaari portions. I had heard reviews that the first part was slow but I had no problems whatsoever with it. I think the audience in the theatre felt the same. The second half was excellent up until the last 5-7 minutes which I already mentioned. Performances: My pick of the lot: Ajay Devgan was absolutely fantastic. I have never liked this guy and his recent flicks (YRHPK, RC, HKiK, DKK) have made me detest his acting and selection even more. But he reminded me so much of Amitabh in his youger angry young man roles. Not to compare him with Amitabh but to emphasize Devgan's dialogue delivery, his screen presence, his anger, the action - he had the audience memerized. I think he should do more hard hitting roles.Madhuri Dixit looked divine and acted brilliantly. She has come a full circle and stepped into veteran position in my books. This lady is a world-class performer and desrves full marks for her work here. I think she surpassed Mrityudand 10 times in this film because what she has done in Lajja has put her into the all time great actresses list. After the high marks that Madhuri receives for her performance you would think there would be no room to go beyond perfection? right? Well this place is what Rekha has achieved with Lajja. This, in my opinion, is Rekha's glory to cinematic immortality along with Umrao Jaan. Her work in Lajja is as good as the finest performances of legendary female artistes in bollywood or Hollywood. Her breakdown on finding out about her son's relationship and her pleading sequence before being raped and burnt is in one word - eh there is no word to describe it - Superlative, Perfect, Excellent do not do justice. This must be seen to understand. Manisha and Mahima? They are pretty good and have sequences where they both show their talents. They will get more chances in the future to demonstrate their greatness - they definitely are very talented. Anil Kapoor was very funny and very good but any actor will lose in praise in front of high drama. Unfortunately, this is what happens to Anil in Lajja. Anil Kapoor is such a great actor he is taken for granted. He is very cool and performs comedy sequences with aplomb - audiences loved him but he'll not be the first to be remembered in this film. Lagaan is still the perfect movie this year." 
" Good&Bad.","The Hindi directors are brilliant in depicting gory authenticity that an ordinary viewer is horrified to see on the screen, when even the thought of the same is difficult to fathom. The rape scene of the character of Rekha is something that will haunt any one with a conscience, not only her true portrayal but the ugliness and heinout extent of the crime. The movie has several parts to it each with its own pathetic ending. Madhuri Dixit, Urmila Matondkar have done a formidable job. But the ace is Rekha, whose perf. is truly to the core of the character. She is shown her true potential here. If you have a long day and looking for pure entertainment in the nature of Song&Dance number, this is a movie to avoid, since the brute violence is baffling and lingers and lasts long after the movie." 
" Disturbing......","This film about the plight of women in india is indeed deeply disturbing and angry.Shock value and ultra realism have been used to the max. The world needs to wake up and understand the plight of women in more conservative societies, and in general.The film has been well shot and the acting is of a high standard, though right from the scene where Madhuri dixit is shunned by all through to Rekhas brutal rape the film seems to leave a bad taste that sort of leaves you feeling very shaken up indeed. this film is not for the faint hearted or those who want as a close a look as they can at the plight of women in india.This movie wasn't enjoyable and I don't think it was meant to entertain even though there are some lighter moments in the film. I would give this a 7 out of 10. not bad not entirely brilliant either." 
" It could have been so much more - but it's still good","Rajkumar Santoshi should be lauded for the subject he takes on, and deserves praise for not being faint-hearted about it. He is not afraid to show, literally, what happens to women in India. That being said, Santhoshi suffers a bit from his 'evangelism': like anyone who has found a true and important message, he tends to over-scream himself a bit: we hear dramatic strings suggesting dire traumas even when manisha in the beginning suffers just minor mishaps compared to the very real trauma we see later on. This overdoing it especially hinders the beginning of the film. The ending of the film is also completely unbelievable: why would Manisha return to Jackie Shroff? Why would Shroff have changed his views of womanhood? I guess its a Bollywood thing to give movies a happy ending, even though I know plenty of them that don't end happily. Then again, a realistic ending would probably have been too much - and in that sense, Santoshi should be excused somewhat for his mishaps, since any medium could not portray the real-live horrors he wants us to see.That said, I think praise should be given to Anil Kapoor and Ajay Devgan for really doing their job really well: they are true supporting actors, and they provide a sparkle of light and hope in a world which is for the rest completely dark. These two characters help Santoshi to make clear that not ALL men are bad, but he also gives these men sufficient lack of depth and somewhat above human proportions to make clear that us men still have some way to go before we are up to a normal, civilized standards. he makes them heroes somewhat, and intendedly so, since I guess he wants to inspire little Indian boys to be like them.The best acting however is done by the ladies. There's not much I can add to what has been said already: Mahima Chaudhary is able to keep it up, Manisha starts off a bit awkward but ends up very impressive - but the most impressive acting is done by Madhuri and Rekha: I can't decide whose performance I found better, but thankfully, I don't have to choose.Madhuri was good since she..well, dear god, she's always good! Completely natural, completely in character, and bringing that unique fire and spirit that is hers to every role. From the moment where she interrupts the Ramayana (and to be sure for western viewers, the revolt of the crowd thereafter isn't so unbelievable!) to speak her mind until she gets trampled by the angry crowd, she's just....goddess-like. And mind the little details she puts in her role: when Manisha wants to pick her up after she's been battered, Madhuri at first is also scared of Manisha: I actually felt the mortal fear she portrayed at that moment.And Rekha...wow! Let me rephrase that: WOW!!!! The moment she finds out her son was dating a higher caste girl, who happens to be the daughter of the village bad guy, she bursts out so...WOW!!!! It had my blood curdling, definitely. And then the rape-and-death scene. What made it so strong is that Rekha was actually able to portray how even the closest of friends suddenly become strange beasts: rapists and murderers. She pleas for mercy whilst at the same time she just literally bleeds mortal fear - true mortal fear. Her rendering of Ramdulari is truly, honestly of epic proportions - and I am talking Greek tragedy, Euripides-play epic proportions. Add to that the fact that this scene is based on true events - and you understand that after this scene, the movie has basically ended.But it didn't end: Santoshi made place for one more speech by Manisha (good call) and some weird scenes (bad call). But the attempt at a happy ending and the crappy job Santoshi does at it, does give you time to recover from what you've just witnessed. The sheer idiocy in it allows you to just barely smile at the friends you've watched it with again and be able to talk about what you just witnessed. And when you do, realize: what you've just witnessed is everyday reality still." 
" The best hindi movie I have seen in years","I absolutley loved this movie. No doubt Lajja will become a masterpiece. Manisha Koirala, Mahima Chaudhary, Rekha, and Madhuri Dixit give such memorable performances in this film. The dance numbers with Urmila Matondker and Sonali is wonderful.Lajja is a story of four women and thier struggle in men's society. It is a story of survival." 
" An absolute classic! Marvelous, simply marvelous!","This is got to be a classic of Hindi cinema. It is so well done, technically and performance-wise and the selection of the top-class female cast alone is a reason to like this film. But most of all it did an outstanding job of taking on a serious issue and yet produce a powerful work of art that shines.Right from the start, it is chilly, that cry of Ramdulai and the sari floating in the wind. This nightmare dream makes it clear that this is not going to be fun. The most disturbing events are shot in a frightening detail, but this is not a plain documentary like Bandit Queen, but is more elaborate as a movie for the common people. Thus the message is deeply moving but still bearable even to the more sensitive audience. The comedy and the action are well executed to lighten up the message, but they never become a purpose in themselves, and they always help in delivering the message of humanity, empowerment, and hope. Marvelous, simply marvelous!I give this a 10/10 without the slightest doubt. It outshines even the greatest movies of recent years, such as Pinjar, Lagaan or Swades, Earth, Mission Kashmir, Roja, Bombay, and Dil Se. But Lajja is not for everyone. As a westerner I will say especially that this is not a beginner's film to Hindi cinema. If you don't have a fundamental love for India (yet), you should not watch this, instead watch Swades or Lagaan first." 
" Disturbing but true and gripping!!!Simply amazing","Santoshi is one of the few Indian directors who can touch the reality to its core. The story of the character played by Rekha is based on true story, but all the other stories are also very much based on true stories to some extent. Technically the film is great. Scenes to watch out for: Mahima kicking the 'baratis' @$$. Madhuri's (one of her best performances to date) well, her complete part is gripping right from where she's introduced dancing to Madhubala's 'Jab pyaar kiya to darna kya' to where she cries out her heart for loosing her child. Rekha pleading for help while the villains try to rape her (specially whn she mentions that one of the guy was like his son). There are many many scenes in the film worth an applause. all the actors (including character actors) are amazing. Anil Kapoor is worth mentioning. His character gave a little comic relief in this tragic story along with Jonny Lever." 
" Eye opening experiences","Coincidentally, I watched Lajja and Matrubhoomi on two consecutive days. Both dealt with the male dominated society in India, womans inability to change it, and how the disparity goes unnoticed by both. Life continues as it has been for centuries, unquestioned, unchallenged. Vaidehi too follows the status quo, compliant and submissive as the story develops. Her husband makes it clear that she is valued as a child bearer only, and once his progeny is delivered, she is of no use to him. This is her cue to flee for her life, encountering several women who suffer unnecessarily at the behest of society or man's perverted whims. Well written, very well acted, each encounter is examined through her eyes, as well as those around her. Who will see what is right or wrong? Who will stand up for their own women, which women will learn to stand up for themselves? So many stars, worth watching over again!" 
" Women are trying to find a place in Society","This movie is very gripping and strong. It portrays a sense of loneliness yet unity among women. In other words, a woman (Manisha) feels neglected and goes on a journey to escape it. On the way, she finds women in similar situations and Manisha sees how they handle it. The woman Manisha portrays wants to prove that all women are united and just don't know how to express their feelings of neglect in a way that men and society will not condemn them. The characters in this movie are totally independent albeit linked. Manisha was a little unbalanced at first but as the movie continued her character became stronger and more patriotic. She seemed to be in search of self identity and whether she can escape prying eyes of men. Rekhaji was the most dominant character. She showed that even elder women are subjected to harassment. Her part left the audience wondering if there is any justice for women. Maduri was really interesting. Her role was vivacious yet serious. Mahima was also wonderful. She was given a small role yet powerful. Ajay Devgan balanced the movie. He wanted to show that not every man wants women to be treated like this. The movie is a little slow but the direction was well rounded and beautiful. It is a little biased but when Ajay Devgan enters he balances the equation. A couple of the songs were melodious and it was integrated with the story making it hard to fast forward some of the slow parts. Each scene tends to take some time to come to the point but the climaxes were well done." 
" Santoshi's Feeble Feminism","The bearings of western-style Feminism on the various subcultures of India have hitherto remained largely non-existent, the two entities belonging to alien realms and threatening (in the name of tradition) never to coincide. Art imitates life (or so the claim goes) and popular Hindi cinema is no exception, reflecting an underlying misogyny which, regrettably, forms the foundation of much of the collective Indian culture. But why? What is it about the female gender that has rendered it so hateful to the culture that women are routinely subject to the most unimaginable horrors, including rape, murder, infanticide, imposed illiteracy, infidelity, and the subjugation of spirit that goes under the name of 'dowry'? Rajkumar Santoshi's latest offering, "Lajja", asks the same plaintive question, linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters/episodes which comprise the journey of shame endured by its protagonist, Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala).Direction on Santoshi's part is not up to par with the level the story demands. He fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity in depicting the saga of sadness and confronts the issue of misogyny from the side, instead of head-on. Santoshi has recently said that he did not make the film for an international film festival, but rather for the masses of his country. Regrettably, the tackiness shows, and the film too often delves into the action-blood-gore genre that Santoshi specializes in. The film suffers from its jerky, episodic pace and its ending is rather too contrived.The female cast is given much kinder and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts. The protagonist is played sensitively by the luminescently beautiful Manisha Koirala who proves in Lajja that she is one of our time's more competent leading ladies, and given a proper role and set up, emerges with a truly commendable performance. One wonders how brilliantly she may have shone had the film been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the issue at hand. Mahima Choudhary puts in a laudable performance and continues to show that she is an untapped talent. Cast as Janki, Madhuri Dixit performs with a never-before-seen fervor and felicity for what truly deserves the name of 'acting.' The role of a street smart performer who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the greatest risk in her cannon of song-n-dance roles which have maintained her marquee status over the past decade. Which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this would-be feminist saga, that of the ceaselessly talented Rekha. Lajja is Manisha Koirala's film, there can be no doubt about that, but it is Rekha who dominates the proceedings in a performance that digs into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the vestibules of your heart. Rekha dazzles as Ramdulari, foregoing vanity and complacency to deliver a performance that is so replete with authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this portion of the film. Comparisons are indeed odious, especially when rendered opposite one of the world's great leading ladies, but in the gracious presence of this reigning screen legend the others fade in her shadow."Lajja" has none of the sophistication of proto-feminist dramas like "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar", or even the Hell-Queen celebration "Laadla": it fulfills its feministic goals in two early moments:the loud tirade in which Mahima berates her in-laws for their abuse of her father who has committed no other crime than given birth to a girl. She erupts, leaving the wedding procession in shambles. Seeing her father devastated, she begins to weep, blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her. She bemoans, "Why did I say anything? I have ruined everything! It is all my fault!" Her grandmother, witnessing silently the abuse she bore, comforts her by saying, "Why are you crying? There is no reason for you to be crying. You are not at fault for anything. The fault is mine. The fault is of every woman who came before you, because if we had had the courage to say in our day what you have said today, there would have been no need for you to say anything today." In this scene the importance of the Feminist Legacy is laid plainly in sight through words.The other, more subtle moment comes very early in the film when Vaidehi (Manisha) has fled from her abusive husband to the refuge of her parents' home in India. To viewers of western societies, it may seem perfectly reasonable (indeed, natural) that any abused woman would seek the protective guardianship of her parents; this, however, is a societal taboo in many eastern cultures, India among them. Once a woman has been married, the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets (family, business, children, etc.) For her to turn her back on these responsibilities is a grave social sin, one which truly has no equivalent for the western woman. She is thereafter regarded as tainted and as 'damaged goods', one whose value has been nullified entirely by her own actions and her refusal to submit to the role she has been given. She is not so much an individual as she is an emblem of familial honor. Her father rebukes her for her actions, concerned that his familial honor will be tarnished irreparably by the daughter he had already transferred to another man. His primary concern is that of the impending marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister, a prospect made far less likely with a divorced elder daughter in the same household. He tells her in no uncertain that she must return to the man to whom she lawfully belongs, however violent and sadistic he may be. He levies against her the age old adage that, "The honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter." Quietly and pensively, she replies, "Yes, the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter. But there is no honor for the daughter herself."" 
" Laudable Theme, Gripping Narrative","I saw Lajja on opening night August 31,2001 at a theatre in nearby Diamond Bar. I was drawn to the movie by Rajkumar Santoshi's name, because generally he makes fairly good movies. Anu Malik's name as the composer was also an attraction. Rajkumar Santoshi did not disappoint me. He presented the subject in a fairly compelling way and did not deviate too much to accommodate "entertainment". Once again he did not use all the songs that featured on the film's audiocassette and CD, which will adversely affect the movie at the box-office.His father,P.L. Santoshi who was himself a famous lyricist before he became a film director, knew the importance of songs in an Indian movie. Rajkumar Santoshi, ever since his Ghayal became a hit without the support of music, has tended to ignore music and not give it the centrality it deserves in the Indian cultural context. He could not take advantage of even Nadeem- Shravan in Damini or of A.R. Rahman in his last movie Pukar. At least in the latter he took eminent lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri and also Javed Akhtar (for one number). Here he relies on overworked and mediocre Sameer.The music department(with even the theme song cut out), therefore,is nothing to write home about. Will someone urge him not to repeat the same mistake over and over again?But despite these drawbacks, which are quite serious, the movie works because of its laudable theme, Rajkumar Santoshi's good direction and some good writing too. But here too one fails to understand why a good director of Santoshi's calibre should take upon himself the added burden of writing the screenplay and the dialogue. Bollywood has plenty of good writers who would be happy to work for a director like Santoshi.Overall, it's a good movie.That's why I am giving it an 8 out of 10.
Now a word about the advertising.It is publicised as a movie with three heroes and three heroines whereas the story concerns only one pair played by Manisha Koirala and Jackie Shroff. The rest just come and go.It should have been advertised as just a Manisha Koirala-Jackie Shroff starrer. There should have been no mention of the other famous names who are just guest stars in the movie. Like Salman Khan was not mentioned in the advertising of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and that worked great for the movie.Lajja could have benefited tremendously from the presence of Madhuri Dixit, Anil Kapoor, Rekha and Ajay Devgan if their names had not been advertised and the public discovered them for the first time in the theatre on opening night." 
" Best movie","From the best movies I've ever seen, showing reality in some communities, or at least a fraction of reality, and how women everywhere are oppressed." 
" Over-the-top melodrama with outrageous caricatures. A disappointment","I must admit I expected more from Raj Kumar Santoshi. While this film is being praised in some circles, I found it tedious and sermonizing. The acting is over-the-top, barring some fine work by Ajay Devgun. The actresses are all good woman oppressed by an unjust society. Almost all the male figures (barring our three heroes) are vicious caricatures. The scenes at Mahima's wedding are almost too much to bear. I understand the social value of such films, but surely they shouldn't be THIS black and white. Madhuri shines in a brief appearance and makes the proceedings partially palatable.Overall 3/10" 
" Good cast, well-packaged; over-dramatized screenplay negates all of this","The core message is strong, the cast has given it their best shot, the packaging is excellent, but the screenplay is seriously over-dramatized and every cliche in the book on women's suffering in India has been over-used to the max." 
" Excellent.","Her Excellency Great Madam Urmila Matondkar has performed the best song of her life time.Aaye ye Aajaiye. Music is very good.His Excellency Great Mr. Jackie Shiroff has done very well in this song.An excellent song.Thanks and Regards."
