" worst shaadi on the planet","shaadi no 1 is a real bad movie. the most important point that makes it bad is the corniness. i mean, if the Indian audience found the lines hilarious, then they must get a reality check. i mean, even a third-grader would have difficulties in laughing at those lines. the only reason i was laughing in the theatre was because i was laughing at the actors but not with them.the acting too was pretty pathetic except sanjay dutt who did a decent job(although he got irritating in the second half). I also feel that sophie and riya sen must get some acting lessons.i give this movie a 0.25/100. an advise, don't watch this movie at all." 
" Funny movie, lots of insider jokes","The best thing I liked about the film was the many references to other films. Lucky's "misaals" are mostly nods to well known lines from past films, Munnabhai, Sholay, etc. The "misaals" are impossible to translate, and will make no sense to viewers who had no exposure to the cultural references contained in it. Perhaps this is one reason IMDb users rate it so low. I found the film enjoyable. The scripted dialogue is very clever and quite funny. On a second viewing, I got a lot more of the jokes and cultural references. Most comedies do not warrant a second viewing, but this one improved with it." 
" What a royal waste of time !","I have no words to describe my experience! It's awful, cheap, boring, clich√©d comedy (was it really comedy??)! In my opinion, 2005 has been a wonderful movie year for Bollywood with many good movies! But this one is a shame on this year! This movie probably belonged to 1980's, a tasteless decade in Indian cinema! In some news, I read Shaadi No 1 is last of David Dhawan's comedy! If that is really true (and not a publicity gimmick), I'll be the happiest!I have never seen such bad acting in recent times! Script, Screenplay, Music, Direction, Cinematography... if there is a filmfare award for worst movies, this movie will get at least a dozen award !" 
" a fun movie","I thought that Shaadi No.1 was a fun movie to watch. I saw this movie after I saw No Entry and they were very similar, but it's definitely a sure time-pass!Acting: Sanjay Dutt was OK, but he overacted and "missiles" and his Punjabi accent get very annoying after about 10 minutes.Fardeen Khan was fine in his role and justified it, but I didn't think he was that great with the comedy.Zayed Khan was the best overall in the movie and I think he did very well with the comedy. He also dances so well! I really did enjoy his performance in the movie, and he was definitely my favorite to watch.Sharman Joshi- I don't really know why but he kind of annoyed me in the film. He also justified his role.The wives(Ayesha Takia, Esha Doel, & Soha Ali Khan): they didn't get much scope, but they were fine in their roles. I think the best was Ayesha Takia. The girlfriends (Aarti Chabaaria, Sophie Choudhary, & Riya Sen): They also didn't get much scope, but they fulfilled their roles. I would say the best was Aarti Chabaaria.Songs: They were all very good, they had nice lyrics, and they were choreographed well.It was fun to watch and I completely enjoyed it" 
" what a waste of time and money","one word describes this film "rubbish" if you've got a couple of hours to kill, please do something else rather than watch this sad excuse for a screwball comedy.There's no plot to the "film", Sanjay Dutt's character is extremely annoying far more than the Aussie chap in Salaam Namaste.I came away with a bitter taste after having watched this, surely the actors read the script before even agreeing to appear in this film? Forget get "straight from Cinema to DVD" It should be straight from cinema to the dump.Totally unforgettable rubbish." 
" hey you know what it's not that bad","the reason i give this movie 8/10 is because it does have some flaws but otherwise it can make you laugh David Dhawan is the Steven Spielberg of comedy he knows how to pick his scriptwriters Milap Zaveri did the dialogues can you please put that down IMDb.com i don't know who the screenwriter is because the credits don't show it overall good movie it basically runs on a pattern and how everybody mainly the main male characters get out of trouble that seems to pop up everywhere seeing that is funny overall great acting by everybody too many songs but luckily i watched it on DVD so songs weren't a problem the heroines were sexy good movie this deserves a chance please watch it and enjoy" 
" 3 men juggle 3 gorgeous wives & 3 gorgeous girlfriends","a screwball comedy which is mildly amusing. "lucky" is the catalyst & very irritating. the editing is overdone. many variations on what can go wrong. both the wives & the girlfriends are total babes. the music is OK & the editing style is overly influenced by MTV with tons of quick edits, which is distracting & very unnecessary. the film goes on way too long, even by Indian standards. the opener is rather unusual, with the 3 men, all buddies attempting suicide by 3 different methods & failing in stupid manners. they then meet their future boss who also in trying to end it all & save him. they save his bacon & he hires them which then leads to the plot complication of his 3 daughters, who have been abroad & no longer respecting traditional values" 
" Hilarious!!!","Wow if there's a movie you gotta see this year make it Shaadi no.1!!!It is SERIOUSLY NON STOP FUN!!!Really big star cast!!! Over 14 stars! It really is so funny, you will laugh the whole movie through! Lots of nice music, pure jokes, SPIDERKHAN!!! lots of guys might get ideas from this movie, but ladies you need to watch to make sure your not falling for these tricks! They start of with trying to commit suicide but fail, the story takes off on an interesting edge, don't worry their not dead just married! Their tired of life and want more fun which their wives aren't too interested in, so they find themselves girlfriends, which puts so many problems in place!!! Wait until lucky brother finds out!!! An added bonus is the sexy Zayed Khan! Damn hes hot! Lots of love *Anjali*" 
" What a waste","I can hardly believe that people like this movie. It was simply ridicules. David Dhawan has simply lost his mind. After Masti every director is exploiting the same script. The jokes were pathetic. Non-sense comedy and above all Sanjay Dutt. He was probably the worse in the movie. I mean his annoying one liner "missalen" sayings in that Punjabi accent were awful. Through out the movie he was the most annoying character and rather than funny. The script is quite loose. I mean how a stranger walks into the life of three married couple can and just pretends to know them. All in all for people who enjoyed this movie they need a head MRI.Please! Do not waste your time and money on it and if possible do not even watch it for free." 
" Barbaadi No. 1","After the two pathetic ones- Masti and No entry we have another similar, regressive sick film. The reason is very simple. Those two were hits unfortunately. We have again three sick, married (surprisingly how come?) MCP types unable to control their libidos, and therefore chasing the skirts outside their marriage, and who ultimately are set right as per the norms of the happily married ones by one Mr. Lucky Bhaiyya. Throughout the film, he gives 'Misaals" (Examples) which he rightly call 'Missiles" as to escape them audience actually have to look for an outlet from the Theatre. The humor if at all it is called is sadistic, self-deprecating type. The characters look like buffoons as they mouth some gibberish trash lines that are called dialogs according to writer Milap Zaveri as usual. Also our trade pundits, should take a notice about the kind of stuff Director David Dhawan is capable of delivering when both of his regular writers- Anees Bazmee and Rumi Jaffrey are not with him. Finally, it is not Shaadi no. 1 but is Barbaadi no. 1. This reminds me of a recent joke going around in the industry. Director Kunal Kohli said he find it very insulting when he is not permitted in for the premiere of this film. Little did he know how fortunate he is as he escaped this intolerable, shoddy Stuff?Story line - Are You Joking? Rating- No more Jokes please!" 
" Loads of sexy actresses but Poor movie","I was looking forward to watching this movie as the trailers looked good. It is directed by David Dhawan, who has given us a couple of entertaining movies in the past. Shaadi No. 1 has an incredibly large cast of actors and looked like a Hit. A lousy script about 3 guys who want to commit suicide because there not happy with married life (how realistic and funny). They suddenly make a deal with a man to fall in love with his spoilt daughters and dump them. After many appalling flirting techniques, they manage to romance these childish girls. Suddenaly, a stranger comes and tells them he knows about their affairs, and he will tell their wives. It then follows into cheap comedy, that doesn't make you laugh a single bit. Sanjay Dutt is the stranger, why did a Great actor like him make this pathetic movie. Fardeen Khan has given us some good films, but he seems to be making worser movie over and over again. Sharman Joshi was funny in style and maybe the least annoying character in the movie. Zayed Khan gives us another Flop movie, remember (Main Hoon Na = Anybody that makes a Shahrukh Khan film have a big advantage). Esha Deol and Soha Ali Khan give dreadful performances in annoying roles. Ayesha Takia looks sexy as ever and is incredibly cute with the sweetest smile, but her looks couldn't save the film. Riya Sen is another sex bomb, that couldn't save the film. Introducing singer Sophie in a unimpressive role. Finally Aarti Chabria who looks pretty but her acting once again was poor. I would of given this a 0/10, but because of the girls a 2/10. Out of all the girls, i would love to have a three some with Riya Sen and Aarti Chabria. Their is a song in this film Zara zara where Ayesha Takia shows her melon curves, wow i would love to suck them melons." 
" Whatz up with DD?","DD earlier made remarkable comedies though illogical yet funnyThis is a weird film by him, he tried the MASTI formula and brought an identical story of 3 guys who hav 3 wives and search for love outside even the characters are similarThe comedy scenes are so cringe worthy, it looks like we are watching a stage play, the dialogues too are damn stage likeThe spiderman jokes are so bizarre while the Sanju angle and all other stuff is contrivedThe ending is the worst part of the filmDirection by DD is bad Music is ordinaryCamera-work is only saving graceAmongst actors Fardeen Khan and Zayed Khan shout too loud and act artificially mostly Sharman excels in his part, though this isn't a patch of his best works Amongst girls Esha overacts, Ayesha is just there and the rest are all bad Sanjay is plain horrible, he hams it up badly" 
" I wish i didn't watch it","After reading some of the comments here... I decided not to watch the movie. But today i was free so i did. It was awful.. Sanjay Dutt was the only character worth watching.. It's another version ofMasti with a few changes.... What a waste!! And at the end of the movie they show a party where David Dhawan is cutting a cake... I just burst out laughing.... Why cut a cake for such rubbish?? I mean can't he notice he's made absolute trash.. The sharks and Spiderman scenes were pathetic... Anyway as everybody says don't waste your time on this flop no. 1."
