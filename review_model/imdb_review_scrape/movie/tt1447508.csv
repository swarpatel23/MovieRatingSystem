" Beats most of the American movies I've seen this year","I'm a native American and saw this movie in a theater with maybe 30 Indians (sorry, I'm old enough to find multiple ironies in that sentence). Anyway, I went into this movie with no expectations. Though I've seen a number of Indian movies over the last few years, I knew nothing of this author or director. I laughed out loud more than I have for any Hollywood movie this year. My cohorts found it even funnier than I, but I guarantee you that you don't need to know that much about Indian politics or media to get most of this satire.It starts with a farmer deciding to commit suicide to get his family the $2000 that may save his farm from foreclosure. From there, the media and government turn it into a circus, stepping all over themselves in their self-serving ways.It suffers only in minor ways from a few slow spots and odd shifts in tone, but these are worth sitting through. It's currently showing here only at a suburban Atlanta theater that shows a combination of H-wood and B-wood. This should have been picked up by some American distributer when it showed at Sundance. Hopefully, enough people will see it and generate the buzz to get it to a wider audience." 
" Excellent !","The film is a hard hitting satire about the country, its people and the living conditions. More importantly, it has exposed the Indian psyche. It shows that India is not run by anybody. It runs on its own.The movie also depicts the news media in its true and natural color. I had personally once noticed that "Knee surgery for the PM" was the headline and "24 farmers commit suicide in a week" was under "News in brief" section. Some news channel report every news item as "Breaking news". Basically, they magnify, marginalize and sometimes distort any news depending upon who controls them. Everyone has vested interests.All news channels have just one objective. Drive up their rankings. To do that, they will go to any extent.The movie also depicts politicians in their true color. It is a known fact that they will do anything to win the elections. Well, you cant expect anything else from them because 99% of them are high class thugs.The movie is not meant for the average Indian who expects the formula (1 hero + 1 heroine + villains + 4 love songs + i item girl song + 4 fight scenes) I loved the language used in the film. It is the way a farmer would speak. No fancy monologues (usually referred to as dialogues). There are a few bad words and I wonder what the impact will be if those are removed.I strongly recommend this movie because the situations are quite funny and at times you will laugh like crazy.So go ahead and enjoy!" 
" Nattha, nut tha .","If there's one man in India whom we could term as the Godfather of Bollywood it would be Aamir Khan. Aamir's third consecutive blockbuster , Peepli Live is the ultimate mockery of the Indian Press and The Indian Government. It pragmatically shows us the extremes of Political Conflict and Media 'Sensations'. One of The peculiarity of this movie is the consistent and coherent digression from the protagonist's dilemma to other subsidary comic stories that come up. These short comic mockeries work out wonders for Peepli Live. Talking about the acting, i would not think twice before saying that these village actors are better than Bollywood actors who could just go do some Advertisements and forget about movies. Natthu ,the protagonist hardly said a word, yet his expression and acting made him an awe-inspiring character on the screen. Even Rajpal Yadav wouldn't have played this part so well. The last phase of the movie was a bit disappointing as compared to the rest of it. The movie literally portrayed no seriousness and gave no chance for sympathy until the 80th minute. Immediately and abruptly after that , the movie ended with a meant-to-be-disturbing ending which failed to achieve its motive of an instant change in mood of the viewers; abandoning us somewhere between sympathy and humour - just like what happens when you laugh out at a prank played in class and the next movement be punished by your teacher. But never mind, the movie delivered what it had to - it probably taught the Indian government and Press a lesson , and gave them strong reason to be ashamed of themselves. Don't miss this one, you never know, you may not get a movie as good as this one for a decade or so - this is BOLLYWOOD after all." 
" Take a bow Anusha and Aamir!","Peepli (Live) is a movie which had enormous expectancy levels from the trailers and the very fact that it was produced by THE "Aamir Khan Productions" which had gave birth to many enchanting & consummate cinematic experiences on celluloid... It has absolutely educed even more than the hype it produced, with Anusha Rizvi, a débutante, furnishing an outstanding satire on the backdrop of Indian farmer's suicides...Not getting into the plot, as most of them know it already... What makes this movie into an astounding cinematic experience, is its utmost natural narration and simplicity.. Whether it be the characters, situations, dialogs... all were just near to utmost realistic...! Humour element used throughout the movie was smart as a whip... Loved the movie for another factor, that it was not preachy at all... Ending which was terrifically weaved out, in some ways, reminds me of one of the greatest satires in Malayalam "Panchavadi Paalam" Anusha Rizvi, being a débutante, doesn't feel like one as the handling of the subject was just awe inspiring... Music and BG were top class... Camera work was good...The screenplay and dialogs were just tight and perfect... Among the performances, the whole cast were literally living their characters in this movie which makes it even more special! One the whole, one should give a whole hearted standing ovation to Anusha Rizvi and Aamir Khan for making this film a reality,which has an amazing potential to be India's iconic movie in the International circuit!" 
" Long Overdue","Satire is always a tricky genre for directors. Always a possibility of making a mockery of a grave situation or making it too serious for the audience (especially Indian) to take it. This balancing act between the poignant and theatrical is a precarious one, which is why Anousha Rizvi's directorial debut is noteworthy. Rizvi, a former reporter/journalist from NDTV brings a more insightful approach to the problem of farmer suicides and dynamics of media coverage.I am not a great fan of Indian cinema. But every once in a while a movie comes along that shows ambition and reach which is not reminiscent of our cinema in general. The script while focusing on the predicament of farmers also manages to bring in the role of the media and the politicians. Probably, one of the more well rounded scripts in Hindi cinema in recent times.The plot:-" Natha a poor farmer from Peepli village in the heart of rural India is about to lose his plot of land due to an unpaid government loan. A quick fix to the problem is the very same government's program that aids the families of indebted farmers who have committed suicide. As a means of survival Farmer Natha can choose to die!!! His brother is happy to push him towards this unique 'honor' but Natha is reluctant. Local elections are around the corner and what might have been another unnoticed event turns into a 'cause celebré' with everyone wanting a piece of the action. Political bigwigs, high-ranking bureaucrats, local henchmen and the ever-zealous media descend upon sleepy Peepli to stake their claim. The question on everyone's lips - "Will he or Won't he?" As the mania escalates what will be the fate of Farmer Natha; nobody seems to care how he really feels?"The criticism levelled out at the film inspite of the positive reviews is the lack of empathy it generates for the state of the farmers. It is a fair argument if those were your expectations from the film. My take is that it wasn't and it shouldn't be a director's prerogative to "effect" the audience. Especially in a satire, where the prime motive is to poke fun at the theatrical failure of system and its participants. Be it "Dr. Strangelove or how I learn to stop worrying and love the bomb" , "Network" , "Wag the dog", "Jaane Bhi do Yaaron" or any other great satire, I never really think the writer was conscious of establishing sympathy or empathy for the characters. Humour in life and films was essentially developed to convey some real harsh absolute truths in a sugar coated manner. We from the cities who our so pre occupied with planning our weekend, our holidays, our Diwali shopping, job appraisal etc can't be realistically expected to be social workers and understand the true plight of the farmers after paying Rs. 200 for an A/c theatre with sofa seat. It is quite incredible how insulated we are from "less privileged".Of the performances everyone if top notch. Raghuveer Yadav is an explosive talent and I am glad he got this role. On a slight negative, the gag got a bit stretched in second half which could have been edited by 5-10 minutes. It is always a risk in a satire, when unnecessary emphasis is added on an element that audiences have understood, in this case it was of media "sensationalization". I think it was truly insightful in showing political and media nexus and how the cover stories and sound bytes are planned for. Maybe after this, people consuming the news will be more discrete." 
" When will Chinese directors make a good film like this one?","I have seen quite a few Indian films. Most of them are about love with plenty of singing and dancing which can become boring.This film is a total black comedy. It is not about love, it is entirely different. And if you like this one, you should definitely watch the other one - Well Done Abba! Both films are about poor people dealing with bureaucracy in India. India and China all have large population of farmers, poor people. And both countries have tons of bureaucrats to deal with.Only in India, can this film be made. If someone wants to make a similar film in China, his/her project will be guaranteed to be rejected by the Chinese government due to its lack of "patriotism". In mainland China, no director can make a movie that is exposing the dark side of the Chinese government.I enjoy this movie very much. Unlike other Indian films which are almost always more than 2 hours long. This movie ended right on time, only about 90 minutes long. And it didn't have any particular singing or dancing scenes which are really improper for this kind of topic.I only wish that some Chinese directors can watch this film and the other one "well done abba". And I hope that the Chinese communist government will be overthrown soon, so that Chinese directors can have the freedom to make some good meaningful films just like this one." 
" Peepli Live - Pithy satire clad in slick script","Anusha Rizvi has a story to tell and she does it all too un-preachily. No sermons. No grandstands. Her narrative, taking care of every nuance, puts the point right across, and manages to move you. She takes a light- hearted approach to a serious issue. The satire, directed at the media and the government, tends to go tad bit overboard, but is hard-hitting and convincing, for most part. Laudable performances by theatre artists Omkar Das Manikpuri as Natha and Raghubir Yadav as Budhia, (Natha's elder brother). A first timer in the Hindi film industry, Omkar Das is sure to take you by surprise. You may not take to him instantly but his childlike vulnerability and subtle ways, win you over, as the story progresses. Be it his tripping in the gobar, or his confiding in Budhia that he doesn't want to suicide, or the tenderness with which he pats the goat, even as he lies cowering from his own set of woes. (Titbit - Apparently, Rizvi spotted Omkar Das at a play in Bhopal. Until then, Amir was suppose to play Natha) Raghubir Yadav is born to act. He emotes flawlessly. One such scene is where he is arguing with Natha over who should suicide. Within a second, he solemnly vows to suicide, all teary-eyed, in the next, he takes a 'relieved' drag off his beedi, having managed to convince innocent Natha to sacrifice his life ;) From the grouchy (yet entertaining) amma (Farookh Zafar), to Natha's nagging wife Dhaniya (Shalini Vatsa); from the B-grade Hindi news channel correspondent Deepak, to the stoic English news channel reporter Nandita (Malaika Shenoy), it's a perfect cast all the way. The film gets drab and predictable in parts but manages to leave an impact, nevertheless!" 
" A Nutshell Review: Peepli Live","Two nights ago Iwas participating in an online live chat with Aamir Khan (well, along with some 13000 others from around the world) who along with wife Kiran Rao, served as producers for Peepli Live, and as a parting remarked, had urged his fans to encourage their friends, especially those who have never watched an Indian film before, to give this a go, because this is not quite like the stereotypical films Indian cinema churns out with larger than life heroes romancing heroines in fantasy dream worlds.And it's true, not that Indian cinema has always stuck with that unmistakable notion of how it presents itself, as over the years I've seen independent efforts that churn out hard-hitting stories that are minus the celebrities, but almost always have a message it wants to tell. Peepli Live departs from the usual 3 hours with interval, song and dance routines, to touch on a stark social issue in India – that of poverty and the lives of the rural folk, how inept the government is in lifting its people out of such a plight, and the role of the media that can sometimes get out of hand with less than responsible reporting. Which more mainstream films like Rann and Raajneeti would have also touched upon, but minus the heartfelt comedy that this satire brought along.Written and directed by Anusha Rizvi in her feature film debut, one cannot escape from the fact that her journalistic background may have paved the way at the harsh yet comical criticism of the media in general, where reporters scramble to scoop and spin their own tales of rural life, and are relentless in their interviews with just about anyone who has an opinion on the issue at hand, that of the voluntary death of one of their own. They poke their noses everywhere, and when things turn dull, even resort to fabrication or plain making a mountain out of a molehill. I cannot deny that part of the fun here is watching how television crew and reporters eagerly camp out, in media circus like fashion, in a fictional state and village of Peepli. Just to get a chance at exclusivity with Naatha (Omkar Das Manikpuri) and brother Budhia (Raghubir Yadav) who seemed the smarter of the two.These brotherly farmers open the film as we follow them to the city to seek a deferment in their bank loan, failing which the bank has decided to auction off their asset – their land. So an ominous note has rung out, since farmers without land means an automatic death sentence, especially when the land they live on not only provide sustenance, but that of a roof over their heads and that of the aged mother who's at odds with Naatha's wife, and children. They soon learn of an inexplicable government scheme whereby farmers who commit suicide get financial compensation, and soon decide that Naatha take up that offer. Overheard by a local newsman, this soon gets escalated, and the media descends onto the village to wait out and capture Naatha's death live.Little do the brothers know, being so caught up in their plight of poverty, that their actions have repercussions on a bigger stage, one known as elections, and with politicians scrambling like mad to find an answer to this issue, because if anyone doesn't spin this properly, it'll translate to votes lost. And here Rizvi's subplot shines through again in her very pointed criticism of the way her government, and just about any other government, work, through the usual pointing of fingers between State and Federal lawmakers, and the half- baked schemes that they cook up that generally doesn't benefit anyone (other than looking good themselves), whether consciously knowing that it's a scam, or incompetently just aren't aware. Bootlickers and yes-men bureaucrats get shrewdly dealt with in the story as well.In fact the slight comedy in the film worked wonders to sugar coat the hard hitting messages that Rizvi had intended to tackle, and frankly this may have dulled those messages a little, and ultimately leave one wondering if there's any genuine change that can be brought to tackle the problems at hand. Surely one cannot expect one film to change entire mindsets overnight, and at best, Peepli Live will leave one thinking about the issues, but unfortunately I suppose that's about where it'll stop at.I'm not sure whether the usual audiences weaned on Bollywood fare may take to a film that's a social commentary on some of the biggest problems facing the country, since the enduring way of how cinema is presented provides pure escapism from common everyday problems, but Peepli Live should find its legs in the more patient, appreciative film festival circuit. Don't expect Aamir Khan to pop up at all in the film, but if you know how he works, then you'd know that his hand is probably in every aspect of this production." 
" Chola Maati ke Raam","(2/2)Actors have done their job in the most remarkable way.Raghuveer Yadav can win an Oscar for that but alas Academy is Bollywood- blind.Omkar Das is very natural.The actor playing reporter Deepak is a revelation.Aamir could have done a cameo.(2/2)The story is a wonderful satire.Rizvi being a retired-reporter knew the nuts and bolts of the dirty business.The subplot of Hori Mehto remind us of Do Bheega Zamin.(1/2)Direction of Rizvi collapsed in the last half hour of the movie.The subplot was wasted and climax was done in a hurry.(2/2)The music/score is this year's best.Indian Ocean are superb.Chola Mati ke Raam,Mehngai Daayan,Desh Mera,Aadmi are all well crafted.(2/2)Yes,the movie do have a X-FACTOR.Well paced and presented in the current inflation scenario." 
" Funny Yet Thought Provoking","Bollywood is changing finally! Bigtime!! Makers are now finally shifting their focus on realistic movies rather than making movies having same old clichés and melodrama. Latest film to add in the list is Peepli Live. Produced by ever dependable Aamir Khan, the movie has no big name in the star cast but kudos to Débutante Director Anusha Rizwi's superb screenplay and direction and combining with monstrous marketing strategies by Aamir Khan this created waves worldwide.The subject of the movie is simple yet thought provoking. As India moves to an industrialized economy, farmers are committing suicide. Self- serving politicians at all government levels have been unwilling or unable to do anything about this. While the movie might appear as a spoof on the farmer suicides but it ends up conveying much more and presents some shocking facts.Peepli residents Natha(Omkar Das) and elder brother Budhia(Raghuveer Yadav)after losing their land to the bank for not paying up their loan take the jest seriously and decide to volunteer. Natha decides to commit suicide and it becomes a big news. Reporters Nandita Malik(Malaika Shenoy), Deepak(Vishal Sharma) and a local reporter Rakesh(Nawazuddin) along with others make it a big issue and eventually the positions of many ministers is at stake. What follows is a very well directed satire.Anusha Rizwi has handled her directorial debut like a pro.The lingo is earthy and much humour is derived from the manner it is spoken by the characters. Anusha leaves no stone unturned to poke fun of vote hungry politicians. Acting Department is ruled by Omkar Das and Vishal Sharma. Expressions given by the former make his character very endearing and the dialogues spoken by the latter are hilarious. Raghuveer Yadav has enacted his role impressively! Nawazzudin is exceptional as the reporter whose conscience awakens. Shankar Raman's Camera work makes a good impact. Music by Indian Ocean is OK.To conclude, I would say go for it is you really want to see bollywood coming of its age and of course because its an Aamir Khan Production.My Rating: 7/10Thanks & Regards" 
" Dark Comedy and Deals with a Serious current Issue","Story: Story of two farmers Face loosing their land for an unpaid Government loan. At the time of National Elections they seek help from a Local Politician who suggests to commit suicide to get the benefit to their families.* The Director and Producer deserve thumps up for coming with a movie with current issue - Farmers committing Suicide. * You too would have noticed 'What the News Channels' Want?! They are also marketing something, yes SO CALLED NEWS. And they market like anything. 'Death Toll Reaches 50 and Expected to reach 100 by Tomorrow morning', 'Breaking New - MLA's Sister had Knee Injury' etc..Bollywood - Its very happy see this kind of movies in an Industry where Actors become just a Marketing Executive for their loose Products. Though there are a lot of Directors who just copies and rips from Hollywood or South Indian Movies, there are also few and very few directors and Productions houses who try to come up with new Innovative ideas. UTV is one such Brand and its great to see Aamir Khan producing as Movie in the kind of changing Bollywood to more meaningful.The style of Director is sharp and strong though the director missed to convey a message - but sticked in to the story and left no Message. The film explores the response of the media. Many Scenes of the film spoofs the Internet and TV Media and Politics. The Natural and Simple Narration will take you to those good old Days where only good movies where produced. Problems of Farmers was usual topic in Malayalam Movies but Post 2000 - this is the best movie about Farmers to come in India.Bollywood rarely make Sensible movies and Rarely does the Fans make them Box Office HIT. Different Attempt is not accepted easily in North comparing to South of India (Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada) wishing to see more people watching this movie. Promoting this movie only makes Bollywood Look better. Let they come up with more meaningful Movies here after." 
" Foul mouthed Truisms and Suave lies.","Contrary to my gut feeling Peepli Live wasn't too bad a movie to catch , especially when you are looking for entertainment in it's more rudimentary form. Minimalist in her approach, The director of this movie has proved beyond a doubt that melodrama and reality are two very different and hardly reconcilable things. Bare naked in it's projection of Indian Villages, the movie is what Khosla K Ghosla was to the middle class. In fact one feels nauseatic watching those ridiculous 80's 90's flicks where village folk were depicted as specimens from a high end fancy dress exhibition. With damsels wearing mutlicoloured , skimpy clothes and men wearing hideous outfits bearing no similarity whatsoever with the actual village attires.Peepli on the other hand treats everything as it is. The movie is devoid of glamour, any glamour. Which means the movie , given it's theme, is good.There are no subplots which drag the viewer away into romantic liaisons. No sugary silver linings here. The entire cast fits in well with the theme and also makes us wonder as to how can all those Khans, Kapoors , Khannas call themselves actors .I mean the actors in the movie didn't give away anything. The script however was ridden with too many profanities for comfort. The movie could have done without them as well . But that's creative freedom and also gave some folks in the theatre something to cheer about.The movie is good." 
" Finally we have some meaningful Cinema..!!","When i first heard about this movie some time ago I thought that this movie was going to be good movie but it will not be much to be talked about.But now as Mr Aamir Khan has once again proved himself as a brilliant marketer,the movie is one of most talked about movies in recent times. Carrying a meaningful subject,this film proves that how even a serious social topic could be presented interestingly.The film is thoroughly entertaining.Its a sarcasm on the social structure of this country.Not only politicians,but also on the electronic media.An effort should be made that every minister and members of parliament should watch this movie.But its even a chance that they will sleep again after the film gets over." 
" To Laugh or Not to","Indian Cinema off late has matured and produces a treat now and then. I would reckon this one was not an out of the league project of Aamir Khan but certainly an earnest effort, given that the director is on debut. The film portrays the bitter truth of rural India, mocks the Indian media and gives a tight slap on the political system and bureaucracy. I went to watch the film with the notion that the film belongs to the comedy genre, but it did not take much time for me to realize it was satire, it was pure dark humor and felt pity for all those ignorant souls in the cinema hall who are just so far away, so disconnected from real India that they could afford to laugh on such irony. It sure would have been a wakeup call for those ignorant souls if they understood the hidden satire, carefully wrapped in humor. God save those who came to watch a comic movie and went out of the hall smiling and mocking the plight of Nathu Ram. As far as acting is concerned, Onkar Das has done a very good job, despite the fact that he gets less chance to showcase his dialog delivery yet he has conveyed director's idea marvelously using his expressions. I believe he has surpassed Raghubir Yadav, who has yet again proved the point that he is still among the best in the business. One liners and abusive lashes of Nathu Ram's mother give you some respite from the serious note of the movie. Though the cast had no star power except Naseeruddin Shah and the director was a débutant, Hats Off to Aamir for delivering yet another Thought Provoking and intriguing gem. The movie succeeds in informing the ignorant urban population, population which believes India is prospering, about the truth of real India. Face the reality dude, time to wake up. A definite one time watch." 
" Brilliant!!!","Peepli is another piece of magic from Amir Khan Productions. The best part of the movie is that it raises issues without getting melodramatic and preachy like other bollywood stuff. Script is compact and stays true to its story. The story consequently touches your heart, especially 'Hori Mahato',( if anyone has read Premchand's 'Godaan') whose death almost broke me into tears. The scenes are well placed with perfect ensemble of fine actors to play them out. The comic placement makes this movie fun to watch, The characters of English 'know it all' journalist and Hindi reporter are reminiscent of we all know who, politicians and bureaucrats are ridiculously close to what they are in real life, and the village people are as close to reality as i have seen in any Hindi movie till date. Music by Indian ocean and Ram Sampath captures the essence of the movie, the only odd thing is the placement of 'mehngayee... ' song in otherwise flawless movie. i would recommend this movie for everyone..." 
" Disappointing and Depressing","I watched the movie Peepli Live today, and it left me disappointed and depressed. I already know the current state of India, how it is soiled in corruption, red tape and dirty politics – what I didn't learn is how can I make a difference what I, the Common Man of India can do today to ensure a more prosperous tomorrow. The movie had plenty of Masala, its fair share of Profanities (were they trying to say its commonplace in India? – I know that too), lots of humor, pathetic and sorry humor that should make every Indian cry in shame about his country and vow to make a difference. But no, the effect it had on my fellow countrymen was frantic laughter. Ironic is an understatement for the movie; Tragic is a more apt word. Tragic not because the "big-shot" director Aamir Khan decided to make a film exposing the true face of "Real India, Poor India" (yet again). No, tragic because he made no attempt at encouraging his countrymen to take some action in fixing it. He did a better job encouraging (urging) the youth to take up violent measures, through another of his blockbusters, Rang De Basanti. This movie then must be condemned by fervent nationals the same way Slumdog Millionaire was only worse because Slumdog was a Hollywood film, made by a foreigner, who didn't care about his country anyway. No far worse, because Aamir Khan is this self proclaimed activist and catalyst of change, who allegedly vowed to give part of his Taare Zameen Par earnings out as development fund to schools. Not a penny has been received by any school yet, says a friend and senior student of politics, Devendra Pai.It's as simple as this – movies are made to entertain, with a side motive being educating and uplifting the masses. But movies like Peepli Live, that take India's case apart, and that too in a cheeky mockery, must be banned from public broadcast, unless they feature some relief, some take-home for the audience, that they might use as a starting point in overcoming the same painful issues that they have now made a laughing stock of. Undoubtedly, movies direct wandering minds (youths, our country's future), inspire and induce action – and certainly any efforts to exacerbate our country's predicament, through the media or otherwise, must be curbed.
