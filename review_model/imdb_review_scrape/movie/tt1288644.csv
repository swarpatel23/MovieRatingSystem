" Be ready to take a dreamy ride ....","The movie will take you to some dreamy ride and a surprising concept of interaction with your dreams. Bollywood is amidst of its most experimental Cinema time and this movie is a special effort by Director Madhureeta Anand in that series. Wonderful, artistic, awesome are not the words for this movie but still its a colorful, good movie. The movie portrays life of a woman, disrespected and mentally harassed by her husband, whose life takes a turn when she start talking with her dream. Raima Sen's performance is good when it comes to a harassed housewife. Randeep Hudda is effective as always and did a great job. His changing outfits in different scenes sometimes make you smile. The movie overall is good and a light and nice experience to watch. The rule for the day is "Throw your logical brain outside before you start watching the movie"." 
" Charming!","Awesome, especially if you can get of Randeep Hooda's sometimes fruity attempt at playing Romeo/Mr. Right/Casanova/James Bond. I loved this film and I knew that it wouldn't get rated highly because of the theme of the movie (it's an Indian film about infidelity and separation in a land where divorce rates are the lowest in the world) but so what, it's your loss if you can't get over the fact that there is life after a failed marriage. This film is about a woman who finds out her husband is cheating on her and decides to make a life for herself and her daughter by reviving the dreams of being a singer she gave up when she got married. I loved how whenever she had a fight with her husband she would go into her dreams and have an affair. Go Maya! LOL! :-)" 
" Purple Rose of Cairo done up Hindi style!","If I hadn't read "a dreamy ride," I would never have watched this movie, and I would have missed what turned out to be a heart-warming treat. This movie is well-done, but it isn't normal Hindi movie fair. I read the review and decided to give it a try, though I was concerned that 'dreamy ride' meant Saawariya fair.. I was wrong. It isn't overly theatrical in the least. The characters interact in a very real way. It's just that our protagonist, heroine if you will, resorts to her daydreams to escape an untenable life, thus, Woody Allen's Purple Rose of Cairo comes to mind. This is not, however, a ripoff of that movie at all. It is pure Mumbai daily life. The actors are all excellent, believable, as is the setting. There is one thing that I questioned, that she could be in a mentally and physically abusive relationship for so long (she mentions eight years, but her daughter seems older than that) and still find her way out by her own strength of will. However, I was more than willing to buy into it, because after ten minutes I was hooked. I will mention as well that I really enjoyed seeing Suhasini Mulay as the comforting neighbor. She lent a credible tone to the cast and movie. One more thing, it was really nice to see a Hindi movie where, in the end, a bad character doesn't do that very unrealistic 'turn for the better' that is so completely unbelievable.. he stays true to form and we are not pushed to believe that he overnight becomes a better person. Overall a very watchable and uplifting movie, especially if you want to be given a push to believe in yourself." 
" Not much popular yet a beautiful ride towards realising your dreams..¶{ik bar fail hue to dobara koshish karo;koshish hi safalata ki pehli aur aakhiri seedi hai...}¶","Jus love Randeep hooda's cute smile and killer looks in this movie. It is not so popular one but it's so meaningful that I just love the message they conveyed-to live your dreams despite of rejected by the most important person in your life.if you yourself couldn't believe in your dreams then it's impossible for them to become true.start being yourself and deny being a shadow of anyone. its very important for everyone to try atleast once to try to live their dreams.
Raima Sen had portrayed the faithfulness towards his husband and emotions,loneliness,desires and aroused in her life as well as responsibilities of being a mother and a wife very well.
Not too much known actors,yet everyone is perfect in their particular roles."
