" An Akshay Kumar Romance Movie to Fall in Love With!",""Humko Deewana Kar Gaye" is a quintessential romance movie directed by Raj Kanwar which showcases the ever evolving Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar. Fans as well as those who have never seen his films before will doubtless enjoy his charismatic performance. He shows sensitivity and strength in his portrayal of Aditya, a man who finds himself more and more captivated by the fragile and determined Jia portrayed by the beautiful Katrina Kaif. The problem is that both of them are engaged to be married to someone else. Shot on location in Calgary, Canada, the feel of the movie is very Western in many ways with a good amount of English dialogue sprinkled here and there. The music and dances perfectly compliment the budding love story and incorporate both Western and Indian dance. The colorful supporting cast starting with Aditya's fiancée, Sonia (the alluring Bipasha Basu) make the story more realistic by adding a familial dimension to it. The movie asks an important question. Will family traditions be honored or will love prevail? The answer to that question is to be found in this gem of a Bollywood movie which will show us that love is what truly connects us all." 
" very enjoyable","i loved this movie and have the DVD i have watched it over 20 times everything in this movie is so good the songs the scenery acting everything its a love story between akshay and katrina and how they both fall in love with each other and then overcome the obstacles thrown towards them by them been engaged to sum1 else its very sweet and even though katrinas voice was dubbed she did a very good job acting wise akshay was great this guy can romance a 23 yr old at the age of 39 and look 25 only akshay could do that anil and bipasha also add a good touch to the movie but akshay and katrina carry this movie out fantastically watch it stuff the bad reviews this movie is a real tear jerker romance" 
" Humko Deewana Kar Gaye Really a Great Movie!","i just watched it now i never loved a movie that much only Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna is The only Movie i Love more than Humko Deewana Kar Gaye but Still Humko Deewana Kar Gaye so wonderful the story not far from Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna anyway The Love must when no matter what thats my opinion besides i don't agree with those kids who don't like Humko Deewana Kar Gaye or Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna and No Wonder because you cant like those movies unless you are mature enough and understand the true meaning of love and also have to not be soo chaotic about what u believe just have to feel the love because love is the greatest faith in this life you don't agree with that who cares you will die alone!" 
" the film is OK","As far as I am concerned this movie is OK. I see it from a very different light. 1. actors and actresses are supposed to be flexible and are supposed to be able to play all kinds of role or else we don't refer to them as good. So there is absolutely nothing wrong with our hero playing a romantic even though he's known for action packed roles. Even Hollywood actors and actresses play roles outside the ones they are known for e.g Tom Cruise in "Eyes wide shut" and "Vanilla sky", Bruce Willis in "Colour of the night" Even Arnold in "The twin"etc. SO I don't see that point against him at all.2 Well I agree the plot is guy saves girl from trouble and girl falls in love with guy and trouble because the family wont agree which is common but most Indian films are kind of something like and all the same the movie is still touching and it is OK for a romance film.Like I said before as far as I am concerned the movie is okay and I like it a lot I've watched the ending time and again for countless number of times cos I love it a lot. Kudos to the director. And my people in here you don't have to take things so personal as so many people are doing in here. If you hate the director there are better ways of expressing it." 
" Recommended only for Akki Fans",""I think so (sic) it's destiny," groans our hero caught in a love jam that throttles him from both ends. Indeed, we think so too.Akshay Kumar's films are becoming classier by the month. There's a certain restrain in his presence here. The way he conveys the pain and hurt of an impossible love, is quite surprising for an actor who until recently was counted among the wooden.Director Raj Kanwar's recent efforts to polish up his act have yielded tepid results. Dhai Akshar Prem Ke and the box office hit Andaz were louder than the lyrical aspirations of their creator.Kanwar gets it more right this time. The theme of 'love versus obligation' is nothing new to our cinema. Then redemptive hope lies in the treatment. And we aren't let down completely in the way the jukebox- symphony moves forward.There's a certain elegance in the movement of the mix 'n' match love story. Aditya (Akshay) and Jiya (Katrina) engaged to marry the wrong life partners must move towards that inevitable mutual embrace at the end when the scrambled game of musical chairs finally ends.In between there are several musical pieces choreographed with an eye-catching élan. One of them filmed in a commodious banquet even has yesteryears' cabaret queen Helen breaking into a sassy jig.Such moments are well-knitted into the tale of star-crossed love.Though the film suffers for Raj Kanwar's trademark humbug (superfluous loud Punjabi characters grooving garishly to Bhangra-pop beats, crude gay jokes between Akshay and Mohan Joshi, co-incidences peeking out of an otherwise-smooth narrative ) there's a touch of self-conscious suaveness in the storytelling that goes a long way in keeping the central romance from collapsing under the weight of self-importance.The initial encounters between Aditya and Jia are deftly visualized. Vikas Shivraman's camera frames the good-looking pair with arresting valentinian vibrancy.The dialogues, you feel, could've gone easy on the rhetorics. Often-times you feel the lovers, fighting off their respective engagements to court true love, are reading their lines out of an invisible prompter.But Akshay Kumar-Katrina look terrific together. Akshay's controlled performance spotlights the character's virtuosity in the midst of luscious temptation.Watch him in that almost wordless moment when his screen-friend Vivek Shouq (in a hideous blow-dyed hairstyle) confesses he was behind the lovers' break-upAkshay gives a clenched interpretation to a role that doesn't allow him to 'do' much on screen.Katrina is passably competent in a tailor-made role, giving a mild emotional spin to a couple of scenes. But her inadequacies surface when pitched against Shernaz Patel (in a deplorably minuscule part) or even against Bipasha Basu who, in the brief role of Akshay's ambitious fiancée, brings a fleeting finesse to her under-written part.But pray, what's Anil Kapoor doing playing Katrina's arrogant self-important fiancé? From the start you know this couple is doomed.Don't look for surprises in this smooth-and-shiny romance. Or originality. Bits and pieces from various Hindi and Hollywood creations surface intermittently.But the queasy limit is the climax where Katrina is stuck upside down in a hit-and-run car. The whole sequence is lifted from this year's Oscar winner Crash..That's some quick thinking." 
" Akshay strikes again","Akshay Kumar, India's answer to David Hasselhof, stars in yet another Bollywood melodrama about a doomed love triangle. Hum Ko Deewana Kar Gaye is one of his least entertaining efforts, mainly due to the fact that the film lacks the action sequences which make Akshay's films bearable.Hum Ko Deewana Kar Gaye revolves around a pretty standard love triangle. Akshay plays Aditya, an auto engineer who is engaged to Soniya, a fashion designer. While on a business trip to Canada, Aditya falls in love with Jia, who in turn, is engaged to the rich and powerful Karan. Everything proceeds rather predictably, with Jia and Aditya slowly becoming closer without being unfaithful to their fiancés.The film is not particularly bad, just overly formulaic and unusually boring. Hum Ko Deewana Kar Gaye focuses on the developing romance between Aditya and Jai, ignoring the usual action sequences that Akshay is famous for. There is only one fight scene in which Aditya battles three thieves. The musical interludes are also less entertaining than usual. There is a fun musical number in a restaurant when the family drink spiked juice and another hilariously over the top segment in which Aditya and Jia sing while riding a motorbike and dance on top of snowy mountain peaks. Unfortunately, such scenes are few and far between.In addition to the inimitable Akshay, the cast includes several rising Bollywood stars. Katrina Kaif is lovely as the emotionally torn Jia, while the ridiculously beautiful Bipasha Basu shines as bitchy Soniya. Vivek Shaq also offers some much needed comedy relief as Nawab. Despite these fine performances, the film really revolves around Ashkay and he provides further evidence for being the cheesiest actor ever to grace the silver screen. And yet, I see all of his films. Go figure.Hum Ko Deewana Kar Gaye is worth checking out on video or DVD, when you can fast forward all of the romantic rubbish and enjoy the hilarious dance numbers." 
" The translation of Deewana can have different connotations from crazy to mad. Humko Deewana Kar Gaye lives up to the title with respect to the latter connotation.","In an age when Hindi cinema is winning global respect with films like Black, Rang De Basanti and Being Cyrus, one Humko Deewana Kar Gaye is enough to tarnish the image of the entire industry as a place that churns out conventional crap.What's new about the film one might ask? Absolutely nothing. The same boy-meets-girl story. Both engaged to someone else. Celebration Song! Boy saves girl from goondas. Both fall for each other. Dream sequence love song! The 'someone else' makes an entry at the interval point and takes away the girl. Heartbreak song! And at the end the 'someone else' hands over the girl into the boy's arms. Reunion song! Happy ending? No, a sad beginning! How could director Raj Kanwar at the first place think to start a film on such an age-old clichéd plot? The director claims to have been inspired by some real life story to make this movie. Seems like the real-life story he came across was Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. This is the zillionth version of the film in Bollywood.For how long will the actors indulge in melodrama in the name of performances? For how long will a cinematographer keep revolving the camera during song sequences on cliff ends and mountaintops in the name of scenic photography? For how long will the producer rope in actors for special appearances as surprise elements that no more remain a suspense till the movie releases? For how long will a director regurgitate rotten recipes and yet claim that his film is 'different'? And for how long will the audiences encourage stars rather than performers? The problem with HDKG is it's one-dimensional story. Right from scene one the viewer can predict the next scene without going wrong till the last scene. The screenplay is lousy, long-drawn-out, impractical and simply yawn inducing. The writing (actually the lack of it) is so bland that there are no plot-points, twists or turns in the story that would grab your attention.Picture this scene where Akshay and Katrina are trapped inside their car stuck amidst snow. Throughout the night they don't get out of the car because the doors are stuck in snow. And as morning arrives, Akshay simply scrolls down the window and gets out. So what was he waiting all night for inside the car? To sing a song in a dream sequence and inflict pain on the audience.Akshay Kumar makes you laugh in the film. Now that obviously is not a compliment considering that the film is not a comedy but an emotional drama. Now we are so used to see Akshay in comic roles where he mocks melodrama that when he actually tries to be serious in this film, the scene ends up being unintentionally funny. Not that Akshay is a bad actor, but he is surely wasting his potential with such shoddy scripts.Katrina Kaif gets maximum scope with her screen time and puts in a sincere effort. But then the film has its limitations. Bipasha Basu only gets to flaunt the close up shots of her belly-button in two songs.And was it goodwill or good money that made Anil Kapoor sign the film? Because there was certainly nothing good about the role! He tries his best but his character is so underdeveloped and ineffective that you feel sorry for the actor. He gets into frenzy over his possessiveness pangs but for the sake of a Bollywood hero, turns typically large-hearted at the end and parts away with his fiancée to reunite her with her true love.Interestingly the climax of the film traverses the anti-cultural path as against the other mushy flicks in this genre that go on endorsing Indian traditions. But if director Raj Kanwar thinks that he has attempted something path-breaking in this film by showing a married woman leaving her husband and getting back to her ex-flame, he is mistaken. It will take him ages to come in contact with the modern day film-making. His last few films from Andaaz, Ab Ke Baras to Dhai Akshar Prem Ke had nothing new to offer. We would still prefer a Judaai or a Laadla from you Raj ji even if that takes you to remake a south flick. At least that is better than repeating tried-n-tested Bollywood formulas.The translation of Deewana can have different connotations from crazy to mad. Humko Deewana Kar Gaye lives up to the title with respect to the latter connotation." 
" Film","This film was good but did not live up to ones expectation.I personally think what Akshay Kumar is trying to do at the moment is take every chance that is there as he want to get on top of Bollywood and as far there is no sign of either Salman and Shahrukh so he obviously has no competition. The audience are not use to Akshay playing these type of roles and would like to see him in a action film or even in a comic role. But the people have to understand that he is just taking any offer that comes to him as he wants to be on top of Bollywood before any sign of competition arrives.I personally think many people will not like this film because they are not use to Akshay in a love film. All the songs are very nice and especially Rock Star, For Your Eyes Only and Title Song.One thing I did not get is why is Anil Kapoor in this film? If it was necessary to take Salman out they should have left the film as just a love triangle. I personally think this changed the whole shape of the film and due to the fact that Salman was no longer on this film some scenes have been cut from the film which makes the film less understandable.Overall the film was very good and I liked it." 
" good for romantic genre fans","this film is bollywood's classic love melodrama. in terms of plot it offers nothing new or interesting.but what is does offer is the fresh pairing of akshay & katrina, one of the positives of the film. director raj kanwar is famous for such melodramatic films and HDKG is no exception. there are many songs in the movie, and they keep irritating. the dialogues are okay, the technical features such as editing and cinematography are okay too, nothing brilliant. this is the type of film females will enjoy more as opposed to males.family audiences will be more suited to this film than others. the music is allover average, Fanaa is a great track and the title song is passablehdkg gets a mediocre rating more because of the fact that it offers nothing new, rather than the film being bad. i suppose, when you see too much of something, you start looking at it in a bad light??now to the performances. i have always maintained that akshay has the potential to be the amongst the top. he tries hard in hdkg, and succeeds. it is a restrained performance, another feather in his cap and makes the fact more prominent that hes amongst the best superstars today. katrina is a revelation. she looks great and acts well. a pity that her dialogues are still being dubbed! the rest of the cast are OK.in the end, the film is bad but isn't good either. watch it if you're an akshay/katrina fans or if love dramas is your cup of tea!" 
" It's beautifully shot but that's about it!","I'm telling you, the person who wrote this film was watching Titanic while they were doing so and probably would claim that they unknowingly plagiarised scenes from it (Titanic). I mention the scenes later but let's first talk about the film and casting. Okay, Here's the deal: Akshay Kumar plays Aditya Malhotra (yup, Bollywood is running out of names) a successful business man who as the film opens becomes engaged to a quite shallow and over pampered rich kid named Sonia Berry (yeah, Halle, they're after you now!) and she is played by Bipasha Basu. Okay, they want to show you how much Aditya cares for Sonia (which is very little) when they place him at his own engagement party without a ring to give his would be bride. It's kind of like a transparent foreshadowing of things to come, but in case you didn't notice the DVD cover with Akshaye and Katrina Kaif and the numerous trailers showing ONLY Katrina with Akki then this will be news to you. The song they dance to "She's a rock star" borrows heavily from Jennifer Lopez's "Get right with me" hook but thankfully they didn't plagiarise her lyrics. Neither Akki nor Bips can really shake a leg, so you might wanna skip ahead during this song number.Anyways, after the engagement party Aditya's company transfers him to a branch in Canada and Sonia goes on a business trip to Paris, making way for Aditya to meet and connect in love with Jia (Played by Katrina Kaif). Note that another foreshadowing is the fact that aboard the plane, Sonia lays things out for Aditya, telling him that once they marry she will not be having any kids for him right away because they are both at a stage in their lives were their careers should come first. She even goes so far as to tell him that they will be waiting at least 5 years before she will allow herself to get pregnant. Woah! what a thing to tell your husband-to-be at 10,000 feet in the air. It's no wonder that once Aditya meets Jia, she is a breath of fresh air and sort of like his rescuer from the hurricane known as Sonia Berry. Jia and Aditya then embark on a torrid love affair the ends when its revealed that Jia is also engaged (her spouse to be is played by Anil Kapoor in a special appearance). And just as if you're not grossed out by the fact that 20 year old Katrina is being paired against Akki who is more than twice her age, let's add the tiara that is Anil Kapoor (who is nearly three times her age) to the mix to play her hubby. Really Bollywood casting, how gross can you get?Anyways, they have her looking as matronly as say, Catherine Zeta Jones paired next to these men and the wardrobe people show her no love until the near end of the film when she is dressed as an Indian Bride and just looking at how beautiful she looks at this point is worth the price of admission, or DVD whichever manner you're watching it in.One of the worst scenes in the film takes place where they typecast several Black people as muggers and Aditya has to fight them off Jia in order to save her. And what's up with the accents, people in Canada don't talk that way. How typical of Bollywoood eh? They never cease to amuse me.Okay back to the Titanic similarities: 1. There's a piece of haunting melody that plays throughout the film especially during key scenes that is straight out of Titanic's sinking scene.2. The Dialogue that takes place between Jia and Aditya in the car when they are stuck in the snow sounds exactly like the stuff Jack was telling Rose when he was trying to convince to ditch Cal. Jia's response is also similar to what Rose said to Jack when she goes to meet him at the bow of the ship. Aditya tells her to close her eyes and it's the "I'm flying, Jack" scene from Titanic Bollywood style.3. The scene in which Anil Kapoor's character threatens Jia in her hotel room is exactly like the scene in which Cal threatened Rose after she went frolicking with the third class people the night before.4. The 'for your eyes only' song and dance number is exactly like the scene in which Jack took Rose below deck for the steerage party5. In the song Humko Dewana Kar Gaye (Himesh's version not Sonu's) there is a scene that resembles the flying scene from Titanic, even though they do not use a boat.and this is just off the top of my head. Anywho, it was an okay movie with lots of stereotypes. I liked the songs more than the storyline and Bipasha Basu stood out in the little that she has to do in the film. Too bad we didn't get to see her in Bridal wear. Don't miss Helenji in a cameo as a grandmother." 
" One of the best","This movie was much ahead of its time. No crap just a simple movie you are bound to like" 
" Best Jodi 😘","Akshay n Katrina looked good with each other. 💞💕movie is very good... Drama n emotion is perfect 👍🏼....songs r very good... N akshay katrina acted very well 😘" 
" Best Jodi...😘","Akshay n Katrina looked good with each other 💕💞😘movie is also good... Emotion n drama is perfect.... 👍🏼..songs are very good.... N akshay katrina acted very well 😘💕" 
" Enjoyable, but Just Okay","Aditya (Akshay Kumar), who is engaged to Sonia (Bipasha Basu), travels to Canada for his job. While there, he makes the acquaintance of Jia (Katrina Kaif); they first become friends, then fall in love. However, Jia is also engaged, to powerful and possessive industrialist, Karan (Anil Kapoor). When a misunderstanding comes between Jia and Aditya, they both return to India to plan their separate weddings, while still in love with each other.The plot is mostly predictable, but still generally enjoyable. The music ranges from okay to good, but choreography is well below average; this is a shame as Kaif is an excellent dancer but had no chance to shine. Kumar and Kaif had good chemistry together, and she wasn't as stiff as she has been in other movies. Kapoor was simply perfect for his role. The ending, to me, was rushed and somewhat weak. All together, the movie was a nice time-pass, but not spectacular." 
" amazing Jodi","The story is about the lives of 3 people who are in 3 different positions.Where KAtrina is engaged to a rich businessman ,Akshay portrays a automobile engineer.Bipash is a good friend of Akshay and wishes to marry him. The simple story paves way to some good cameos.Sometimes relatives wont have much to do as that in the film.But they are helpful in every way they can. Love comes through friendship and it comes from each ones heart.The sound tracks are simple and good. When people come in position and power they forget themselves.This is what is shown but some people come back to their original self.Bipasha appears to be a good friend and leaves him.She encourages him to go ahead when she is crying in her mind. Overall,superb performance" 
" What's love ? A feeling ! Yes, a feeling only.","Love (that is, male-female love) is one of the most interesting topics of all the discussions especially when the discussing people are young. Love is also one of the most popular themes for works of fiction, may it be stories or novels or plays or movies. Indian society has seldom been liberal enough to accept love and choosing of own life partner on the part of the young generation. Still love stories have been the most popular ones in Indian movies. Perhaps half of the movies made in different languages of India are having male-female love only as the theme. Why when the Indian society has always considered love as something not desirable and the youths have always been expected to follow the dictates of their elders in matrimonial matters ? Because what's tabooed only attracts the most. It contains a fascination, the fascination of a forbidden fruit. And when adolescence dawns on human-beings, barring exceptions, who does not feel an attraction towards the opposite sex ? Social restrictions can check and affect concrete actions but not the feelings in hearts.But then what's love ? Attraction motivated by (indirect and hidden) carnal needs ? Liking for someone ? Infatuation for someone ? Or something else ? How do we come to know that we are in love with someone special ? How does it dawn on a female that she is in love with a particular male or on a male that he is in love with a particular female ? Well, it dawns through a feeling. A feeling in one's heart which finally envelops his / her whole personality and pervades all his / her thoughts. Yes, love is a feeling and that's why it can't be described or elaborated, it can only be sensed.Bollywood film director Raj Kanwar has directed some good movies. He has a mixed track record consisting of some hits and some flops. Humko Deewaana Kar Gaye (2006) is a flop movie directed by him. However when I saw this movie, I found it to be a fairly good movie - a love story which underscores a very significant fact that I have asserted supra - 'Love is a feeling'. You know it when you feel it. This feeling only is the biggest and in fact, the only evidence of existence of love for someone in your heart.Humko Deewaana Kar Gaye (left me crazy) is the love story of Aaditya (Akshay Kumar) and Jia (Katrina Kaif) who run into each other in Canada. On one hand, Aaditya is already engaged to Sonia (Bipasha Basu), on the other, Jia is the betrothed of Karan (Anil Kapoor). Love blossoms in their hearts with a feeling that they are comfortable in each other's company, they love to be in each other's company and they want each other's company for their lifetime. Through his association with Jia, Aaditya comes to understand that he is not meant for Sonia and Jia only can fill the vacuum in his life. On the other side, Jia understands through Aaditya that love is nothing but a feeling and that feeling she has developed for Aaditya and not Karan.The twist in the tale arrives through a mistake by Aaditya's drunkard friend Nawaab (Vivek Shauq) making some tragic facts of Jia's personal life public which, in turn, leaves her heartbroken and misunderstanding Aaditya for that. Jia gets married to Karan and then only she comes to know that Aaditya is innocent regarding this bad taste giving incident happened with her. But it's too late now. However the story gets a final twist in the climax to have a happy ending for the lovers (and the other ones associated with them too).Except for the melodramatic and unimpressive climax of the story, Humko Deewaana Kar Gaye is overall a good movie which touches the audience, especially the romantic hearts, at many places. The romance of the lead pair in Canada is lovely with the beautiful surroundings adding immensely to it. The sequence of the lead pair moving together in a cold, snowy night is not only very romantic but also very emotional. Life, in the real sense, is only a collection of moments. And there are certain moments that we cherish forever. The romantic moments spent in the association of the sweetheart are such moments only. During them only the feeling of love is felt with utmost intensity.The scene in which Aaditya refers to the wife (Upasana Singh) of his friend Gurpreet (Gurpreet Ghuggi) in a derogatory way and thus generating a wrong notion in his friend's heart for his wife's past leading to a rift between the husband and the wife plus the following scene in which Aaditya only takes corrective action for the unintentional wrong done by him and reunites the couple, are highly touching and underscore the significance of mutual trust in marital life.The movie contains ample comic and relief moments too. The comedy done by Late Vivek Shauq, Gurpreet Ghuggi and child artist Master Abhay Kanwar alongwith Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif generates abundant laughs for the audience. There is a lot of fun and entertainment in the movie before the principal twist in the story thereafter it becomes heavy with sentiments.Technically the movie is admirable. Canada appears to be very beautiful on the screen. There is only one action scene in the movie (in the climax) and that's been executed very well. Editing is good but should have been tighter to reduce the length of the movie. Background score is good. Dialogs contain the essence of the movie.Humko Deewaana Kar Gaye is by no means any extra-ordinary movie. It's a routine love story whose direction is also more or less routine only. However, by default perhaps, it strikes the romantic hearts in a latent way and finds a quality within itself."
