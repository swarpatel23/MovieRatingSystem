" Surprisingly pleasant","I don't watch much Bollywood movies, knowing that most of them are rip-offs or either 'masala movies'. But this one is difficult to put in any category, coz it has this modern feel somehow. Still the acting could have been better (and story too). But overall, I won't say it failed exactly. The love connection between the two lead characters is (likeably) strange. Villain was a typical one. Always the scary but always dumb. One thing I liked specifically was the end. You don't see that in much of the Bollywood films. Overall I thought it was a good enough movie for me. In the end, it's only my opinion. Some people like it, some don't. It's the way of entertainment, you can't satisfy all. 7/10" 
" Modern days Bonney and Clyde.","A Modern days adaptation of Bonney and Clyde. Such movies have been made by Bollywood previously. Chor aura Chaand and Bunty aura Bubly are few examples. It is considered to be more violent after Chor aura Chaand. Whereas Bunty aura Bubly was light one. Yet it can be viewed once. Though It lacks star power, the movie is watchable due to the performance of Nikhil Dwivedi and Richa Chaddha. Richa Chaddha has shown some skin. She is shown as a hot babe. Yet watchable once.It has some punching dialog lines.Powerpack release, which happened this week. Some romantic scene will definitely make you watch it. A moderated budget movie released after Bang Bang and Haider. Watch it if you like hot avatar of RichaChaddha showing her Chaddhi." 
" Why we keep on making films on the same old plots repeatedly?","Beginning with the only name to talk about in the film i.e. Richa Chadda, I always wished to see her in a solo heroine role making a fresh breakthrough as she has repeatedly done in her chosen films in the past. But TAMANCHEY was not the kind of film I expected from the talented girl and was quite surprised to see her doing all 'forceful acting' in a routine kind of role having nothing in it at all post the initial 10 minutes of the film to be precise.TAMANCHEY starts off promisingly with the energetic version of R.D. Burman's "Pyar Mein Dil Pe Maar De Goli" played with the titles and then falls back to the same storyline of two strangers meeting in a mishap, falling in love and then being the rebels marching towards a typical end already seen in several other films. Nikhil Dwivedi tries hard to impress with the local UP lingo and Damandeep Sidhu makes many visible efforts to gain some kind of attention with his intense act. But neither the romance or action works right from the word go nor the direction of debutant Navneet Behal shows any signs of freshness throughout its stale narration.Both the camera-work and background score fail to deliver mainly due to the poor writing making no impression on the viewer whatsoever. And further all predictable sequences bring the film down pretty badly. For instance, can you believe a romance being enjoyed by the robber couple during a bank robbery in the locker room itself? And moreover is it necessary to have a Jagaran sequence in every film based in Delhi since the earlier 'Hits' had it in them too?In short though a few songs in the film sound much better than many current soundtracks, still they are not able to contribute anything special in the movie unfortunately. And the only two good things in TAMANCHEY remain the use of opening notes of song "Pyar Mein Dil Pe Maar De Goli" at few places making you tap your feet and the beautiful Richa Chadda dressed in an Indian attire and going for the skin show in few of her bold scenes. On the other hand, I frankly couldn't understand why the first time director Navneet readily chose such a rotten subject for his directorial venture and didn't opt for something fresh and interesting which at least could have got him some marginal praises for the effort made.However as an ending note I would particularly like to ask Richa Chadda, the one question which is probably put to every single artist promoting his or her film in their promotional interviews that "What really made you sign this film and say yes?" And to make it specific, the question here is not being asked in a positive tone at all." 
" It is toy gun actually","Now a days somehow I get the feel about movie in starting 15 minutes. Within this crucial time, I was damn sure that I had landed in wrong place. Again, I am going to curse myself for my selection. There is no story, screenplay at all but yeah few dialogues are good. Movie takes a steep descending journey from the beginning and reached at climax which is unbearable. You can laugh when characters cry and just pray to get it finished. Performance wise Nikhil Diwedi as Munna, is expressionless but he had taken the dialect of dialogues in good way, again credit goes to dubbing director. Richa chadda as Babu, is good actor but she disappoints a lot here. Music by Krsna is only a relief in this film. One song "Dildara" is melodious. I rarely suggest but this time I have to, please stay away." 
" Boring movie !","It's nothing but a boring movie , both the lead actors performed badly and avoid this movie"
