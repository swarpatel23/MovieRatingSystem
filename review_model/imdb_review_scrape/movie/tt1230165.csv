" Live your dream!","If you loved Dil Chahta Hain, there's no way you'd not like 'Rock ON'. I have just returned from a small screening of the movie last night and it was 'Fantabulous'. I had been waiting for it since long and the wait was worth it. If you think that the movie is all about Rock and being cool, its not. It's about desiring something and breaking all the rules to get there.I don't want to speak out the story here as it is among the best written screenplays I have seen in any movie so far  be it Indian Cinema or Hollywood. The flashbacks and the montages and the cuts were brilliantly placed. There are a few things that I'd specifically ask you to watch out for. First is Jason West's cinematography; absolutely commendable. Then there is the music and sound design which is powerful yet sweet and the star attribute of the movie  the performances. They are flawless, Farhan is good, Prachi is amazing, Suhana is complete and Arjun Rampal has delivered the best performance of his life (watch out for the climax).The live performances in the movie were well done, Magic could have been more aggressive but they had good presence. 'Shair n Func', came and went and their song was pretty catchy. Chakravhyu was super sexyand sheer evil and none the least RADIO were rocking as usual with 'Musafir'  beautiful song that one.In the end Rock On is a really sweet movie and a must watch for the people, both young and old, who dare to dream and are willing to walk that road in order to achieve it. I absolutely loved the movie and am definitely going for it again. Indian Rock Bands rule!!!!!!!" 
" Brilliant! Surprising!","Okay, let me start of by saying that when I first saw a preview, my expectations were not very high for this movie. However, they don't matter anymore.As the title aptly suggests, this movie ROCKS! y far one the most different, entertaining and wonderfully surprising films of recent times. Rock On meets, surpasses and blows the expectations of the viewer out of the window. Brilliant.This movie is one of those rare ones that actually focuses just on the music. It doesn't move of into some romantic tune or dramatic effect. It stays true to it's heart and soul. The Music.All the actors perform brilliantly with a special mention to Arjun Rampal and Prachi Desai who shines out in her debut film. But best of all is the showstopper. Farhan Akhtar. This man is a genius! He can sing (only rock!) act and direct (not this one though). Brilliant. By far the shining star of this move. He carries his role out with exceptional ease and actually seems as good as any seasoned actor of a high caliber. Hats off.In the end, this movie is what it is: " Brilliant as it is, the message is heard as if in stock, this movieends in bliss, but only after making you ROCK!"Superb! Watch it and ROCK ON !!!!!" 
" Rock On!! - A Movie None Should Miss!","Easily my fave movie of this year.Rock On!! portrays the essence of friendship albeit in a different narration, does call for a round of applause for a theme which might not be so popular in India i.e. Rock.The story revolves around four friends forming a rock band called Magik with Aditya ( Farhan Akhtar) the lead vocalist and lyricist, Joe ( Arjun Rampal) the guitarist, KD ( Purab Kohli) on the drums and Rob ( Luke Kenny) on the keyboard, out to cut out an album. Somethings go awry and the friends who shared the same passion drift away, each leading their own life.A decade later, some circumstances bring these four friends together and Magik is in action again to give the most memorable performance ever.The story of course has more to it but you rather watch the movie to learn that.Director Abhishek Kapoor has captured the fragility of relationships on the celluloid with compelling ease. Farhan Akhtar has emerged as an actor and as a super singer, with no signs of débutant syndrome to be seen in his performance. Arjun Rampal surprises with one of his finest performances till date. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy;s music just rocks.The movie Rock On has the blended concoction of some outstanding performances, engulfing emotions and topping it is the execution of the entire theme. I have a gut of the film Rock On is going to rock the box-office as well." 
" Coolest Bollywood Movie ever!!!!","First of all,I must say I'm not a big fan of Hindi movies.I just see them for fun with friends and that's all.But for Rock On! I was expecting something different and I found it!The story is so well written and the direction is superb that the 3 hours which seem like an ordeal with other movies went so smooth and effortlessly.The best part for me was to see Farhan Akhtar make his transition from direction to acting & singing.His was perhaps the best debut you could ever imagine.It seemed liked he had been acting for ages and his singing was way above par.Prachi Desai looked beautiful and did her part excellently.Arjun Rampal acted out his role so maturely you could actually relate to it.Well,I must say this is a Hindi movie not to be missed at all." 
" Rock On carries forward the legacy of Dil Chahta Hai","First of all, I have to tell you that Farhan Akhtar is a ROCKSTAR !!! Man what films he has made till date - DCH, Lakshya and now this one. Along with Farhan, Abhishek Kapoor(whose first film Arryan didn't do too well) too has done a great job as a director. Though I could make out a few goofs, but considering the fact that I was so engrossed in the movie, they can be overlooked.The rest of the cast is excellent. Arjum Rampal for a change is so much better than his earlier performances. But, I still feel he could have done better. Prachi Desai gives a SMASHING performance. So much depth in her character and boy-o-boy, did she play it well. Purab was such a refreshing element throughout. He's completely lovable.Now, for the music. I'm so proud to hear the first mainstream Rock album of India. And I'm glad they have not messed up the songs and have kept the raw, college boy feel to all the songs. Even the slow tracks(2 of them) are so soothing. Brilliant album. Kudos to Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy.Finally, Rock On is really fresh film, if not a classic. Technically its not 10/10 but just for the EQ(emotional quotient) I give it a 10.But, for lovers of mature drama and emotions, it'll be a treat. Thank you Farhan, Abhishek etc. etc. for such a refreshing change. Best Indian film of 2008 till now, hands down !!!!" 
" ROCK ON touched my HEART... Watch this movie with heart full of friendship and eyes wet with emotions","Four friends share a common passion for music and form a rock band called Magik. Aditya (Farhan Akhtar) is the lead vocalist, Joe (Arjun Rampal) is the guitarist, KD (Purab Kohli) is the drummer and Rob (Luke Kenny) handles the keyboard. They get a chance to cut out an album but things don't work out and the group splits to go their separate ways.A decade later Aditya's wife Sakshi (Prachi Desai) attempts to reunite the group. After some initial hiccups and ego clashes, the band members bond and blend to brew good tunes. Predictably the climax is set in a rock concert where the band performs to perfection.Despite such patented predictability, one still relates to Rock On. You noticeably know that Arjun Rampal would make a late entry in the climax concert but your heart still goes out on his appearance. You aren't surprised when one of the band members is diagnosed of cancer but you still feel for him. That's because the simplicity and sincerity of the direction and performances touch you.The storytelling is somewhat slow and drags in the preliminary portions. The film gets into frequent flashback episodes and at times you are caught unaware on the instance where it ends. Even the back-story takes a tad bit long to reach to the point where the band disperses. Unimaginatively the screenplay uses the same scheme of a rock concert for its first key plot-point and also the climax. But seemingly that was inevitable since the genre of the film restricts its creative scope. Also Farhan Akhtar's breakup with his girlfriend doesn't come across quite convincingly.On the upside, the musical theme of the film is ably supported by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's rocking score. For once you don't feel that songs are forced in a Bollywood film. There's also a splendid spoof on how the band merges rock with dandiya to gain some quick money. How one wishes the film had more of such lighter moments which would have accentuated the youthful appeal to Dil Chahta Hai extents. The director also manages to pull off a subtle satire on Anu Malik, while casting him at his own expense.Rock On seems to be clearly designed by Farhan Akhar as his own acting debut and he doesn't let himself down. Lending voice to all his songs helps him to get into his character with effortless ease. One could certainly overlook the lisp in his dialogue delivery. Arjun Rampal looks mature in his character but isn't quite credible while handling the guitar. Purab Kohli has a natural flair for comedy and Luke Kenny is persuasive in his role. From the female leads Shahana Goswami as Arjun's wife comes up with the most compelling act and adds some depth to the drama. Prachi Desai justifies her poised presence.It's interesting how director Abhishek Kapoor attempts to make commercial entertainers on subjects that are not much prevalent in our country. His last film Aryan was on boxing, a sport not much popular in India and now he tries his hands on rock culture, which again isn't much recognized here. At least this time he succeeds in creating a realistic rock feel.Rock On strikes a chord on that note." 
" Rock On: Live your dreams, live your ambitions","I had been waiting to see this movie ever since the promos and trailers hit the theaters. This is the first proper Indian rock band movie, and with a compelling star cast this was bound to be a joy to watch. And I was not disappointed. It was 140 minutes of pure fun. This is finally a movie where we don't have any catchy item numbers or some stupid unwanted songs. Its a movie about a rock band, so we have rock songs. Songs with guitar riffs, drum solos, and kick-ass vocals.The story is quite simple. 4 college buddies dream big, they dream high. They want to form a band and become the next big thing in the upcoming rock culture. They do all that, against all odds, going against their careers their parents chose for them. But somewhere along the line, we have ego clashes amongst the band members, which results in the band breaking up, even before they released their first album. Years later, things have changed. But they make a last gasp reunion, and leave the stage on a high.Whilst the story is critical, for any movie, its not something which is flashy. Its your regular story, one which you can expect out of a Bollywood movie. But the presentation makes the difference. Coupled with some wonderful songs and a brilliant background score, and some superb acting, Rock On! gives you a startlingly different flavor from the regular Bollywood masala movies. The acting has been overall brilliant, there were some patches were it was becoming evident that most of them are newbies in front of the camera, but we can bother to overlook that small mistake. Farhan Akhtar debut performance as the lead singer, Adi, the successful investment banker, the one with the flamboyant vocals, gives a brilliant performance. He is the protagonist of the story, and he controls the tempo of the movie.Add to that he has sung most of the songs himself.Arjun Rampal, as the lead guitarist, Joseph "Joe" Mascarenhas is another complicated character. He is another central character to the story and he gives the movie far more credibility. He's this brilliant guitarist, who has rock in his blood. But he's financially insecure, and this results in his poor family background, his family's fishing business. He has a great sense of pride in his musical talent and like the forefathers of rock, he refuses to sell his pride. He refuses to play in pubs and clubs, and insists on playing for his own happiness rather than for cash, in spite of his family troubles.KD,"Killer Drummer", he's the heart of the band. Purab Kohli, makes it a point to play the drums, and make an honest effort to look credible enough. He's the wacko junkie, with the weirdest possible fashion sense, like wearing a tie over a tee shirt to every gig. Like all others after the Magik era he's wasting away in his family business.Last and definitely not the least Luke Kenny as Rob. He was the manager/keyboardist of the band. He organized gigs for them, and he was the one who became successful musically, recording with Anu Malik on small time jobs. And he was the one who brings the band together after 10 years, amidst tragedies.Special mention must be made of Prachi Desai and Sahana Goswami. Both have been brilliant at the roles they have reprised. Prachi as Sakshi, the wife of Adi, and Sahana as Debbie, Joe's wife gives a superb performance. Especially Sahana, she did a brilliant brilliant job, portraying two very different characters in the two eras. The acting, the music, the camera work, has all been superb, excellent. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy bring forth their magic as the amazing music directors, so does Javed Akhtar with the catchy lyrics.One negative aspect may be, that this movie is somewhat shortened. We could have explored certain characters more, but the makers probably thought to leave this at that, and not make the movie a bit more predictable. For example, Dalip Tahil as Adi's boss has basically just 2 scenes. And Nicollete Bird as the old flame of Adi is almost an extra. Those 2 characters could have been explored a bit. I'm sure there will be long deleted scenes in the DVD.Apart from the brilliant music, the acting, and the character portrayal, the movie also follows a important message. To always follow your dreams and your heart. We see that with Joe, a financially insecure person, who leaves behind a job where hes guaranteed a large sum of money to play with his old band, to ignite his flame, his passion for playing on stage in a proper rock gig. We see Rob, who's dieing away slowly, to overcome all odds and play with his old buddies for one last time, on stage. And lastly KD, in his last lines, "I don't care what you fellows think. But I've been among your personal ego clashes for a long time, and I'm going out there on stage even if I have to drum all alone for 20 minutes, I'll do it." This movie might not appeal to the older audience who might shun this as a youth film. Yes, this movie is based on today's youth, but it carries a message which is universally applicable. It uses the rock culture to promote this meaning, this message. Kudos to Farhan Akhtar again for treating us to another delight. 10/10." 
" Spot On!!","I didn't have many expectations from this one before the release. Then, came the reviews and they were surprisingly positive which raised my expectation bar. And after watching the movie, I realized that both (moive and the reviews) were Spot On!! Abhishek Kapoor's 'Rock On!!' is indeed a rocking and a refreshing film.It tells the story about four young friends who put together a wonderful band called 'Magik' but could never make it big. The movie brilliantly depicts the life of aspiring rock stars in India and carefully handles their rise, fall and reunion. The whole movie see-saws between the past and the present which keeps the viewer interested.Acting is also nice. Frahan Akhtar acts well and is a capable singer. Though I hope he doesn't become Himesh #2 and keeps his singing within limits. Rest of the cast- Arjun, Purab, Luke, Prachi and Sahana also do well.As for the negatives, the movie was a little lengthy. Plus, I believe the incident with "Rob" was unnecessary which didn't suit the general "feel-good" mood of the film.Despite some shortcomings, Rock on!! is indeed a noteworthy attempt and needs to be applauded. Well done." 
" Rock with some Blue","The basic idea of the movie is just as 'Dil Chahta Hai'- a fight between two friends and their reunion(But here there's' much more after the that). Let me clear first: THE SONGS ARE AWESOME 10/10.Very nicely directed, the film has slow pace in the first half and the story may confuse some, as there are a lot of flashbacks. some unwanted characters too included. But the second half has the perfect speed and will cling you to the seats. the whole idea of ROCK ON!! gets concentrated here, no stupid incidences, no unwanted scenes-perfect The only thing which i didn't like was the reunion of MAGIK (not as great as it should be- could be much grand) Talking about performances- everyone does a great Job, special mention for Luke Kenny and Purab Kohli. Prachi Desai (cant say a newcomer, been in daily soaps) looks lovely, acts well. Farhan has surely some thing for Singing. The songs sound genuine as are sung by Farhan than some professional singer. Lots of light moments throughout the film, wonderfully shot. The end is wonderful.... you will probably guess the end, but it will turn out much greater.For hardcore ROCK fans, don't expect NIRVANA, GREENDAY, or DEEP PURLPE, its bollywood ROCKYou will surely come out of the theatre with smiles- thats for sure." 
" Rock On!!...bring it on!","Rock is all about employing electric and bass guitars, thundering drums with a mix of organ or piano or synthesizers giving you all a severe head-banging session. Well, that's what rock means to me and Rock On! is a great attempt bringing the same feel to 70MM! Rock On! is an ideal example of bridging cult with mainline Hindi cinema. Kudos! The movie is about how 4 talented friends with same passion for music creates a band called Magik and wanted to become 'somebody' in music industry. The movie focuses on how they stay together, achieve what they want to, broke up with each other and re-unites one last time. Director has done a marvelous job in bringing all characters alive. He didn't allow more characters floating all around and coming in between. He simply focuses on Magik and their select close ones.Soul of this movie lies in its music. The music of Rock On! is packed with extremely catchy kick ass numbers. Though all the numbers are rocking but my top three favorites are 'Zehreelay' 'Pichhle Saat Dinon' and 'Ye Tumhari Meri Baatein'. 'Zehreelay' is the heaviest soundtrack of any Indian movie so far. It's wild, full of energy and extremely noisy. Lyrics are weird and the interesting part is the vocal. You can do extreme screaming when you sing in English but when it comes to Hindi, it's a different ball game. It is tough to sing so loud and extreme that too with perfect vocals in Hindi. Simply hell yeah! 'Pichhle saat dinon' is a song that grows on you and later, you can't live without. The song is so popular that they have made a spl video for it. 'Ye Tumhari Meri Baatein' is beautiful song with a tinge of jazz to it. It will make you feel as if it is made for you and your love. Another wonderful track is 'Socha hai'. It's like back to roots, real rock song where lyrics come out from no where. Title soundtrack 'Rock On!', 'Sindbad the sailor' and 'Fir Dekhiye' are simply outstanding. Another special song is a slow rock ballad 'Tum ho to'. In age of one song wonder soundtracks Rock On! is a surprise package. Each and every song is a chart buster. In fact, I'm now so used to listening Rock On! songs where ever I roam! Office, Pubs, Music stores and channels, Radio its every where! It's like rock music in its purest form with a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody! The movie is well crafted but the plot is not something new. It's a predictable movie and you know exactly what will happen next. Also, dialogs don't have that punch like the songs and its theme. I like Farhan Akhtar as a director, singer, and actor but excluding his voice. I do not know why but some how he is not that great when he talks.There are so many well crafted scenes that had lit up this movie. My favorite scene is where Magik performs at a local society to raise money. I will not reveal much of it but I just couldn't stop laughing like mad while watching it. Also, the scene where Magik performs at a music contest then fights with each other and split. Its sheer delight as director sketched those scenes brilliantly.Rock On! truly justifies its title with some heavy dope of rocking music and acting. More important, it's the simplicity of the movie which will make you happy while coming out of the movie screen with a message to all- know matter what may come... keep rocking!" 
" a real neat movie rockin all the way","i had an option to either watch rock on or wall-e i decided to see rock on cause i liked farhan akhtar's lakshya and wanted to see how he acts the movie is about 4 friends and their rock band called magik and how situations and events that take place over a course of 10 years changes their lives good acting , good camera work , good music , farhan , arjun , purab , Luke ,everybody have acted very well , first have is real neat , second half i felt a bit lukewarm initially but picks up by the end , please watch ROCK ON !!! the songs are well placed in the movie ,purab's comic timing is nice , the actress that plays arjun's wife acted real well , over all rockin on i did not expect much at the start but by the end i was glad i choose rock on over wall - e" 
" Finally... Rock Hits Bollywood!","Sure, sure. There has been numerous attempts at adapting the greatest music genre of all time into the Hindi arena; at getting rock music to blend in with Indian songs. But while some attempts were partly successful, most of them were as ridiculous as dressing up an elephant in a ballerina costume and expecting a successful ballet.While some original Indian songs (yes, there ARE original un-plagiarized Hindi songs...) have had their own charm about it, it seemed completely alien to the tone and touch that embodies rock. But this movie brings with it some of the first successful merges between the two giant. The ballerina costume doesn't look out of place at all ;) Since I've started out with the songs, let me get a few things clarified first. The lyrics are eclectic. Sporadic, random yet not gibberish. It could have been better, but it's NOT bad at all per se. But the music, and Farhan Akhtar's voice and compelling screen presence all build the songs to a well deserve hype.Performances were amazing. No ham acting, no glitzy deviations, no bullshit It was a honest and down to earth approach, and I, for one, applaud the trend in Bollywood. The plot was simple enough - for a while, it felt like the sequel to 'That Thing You Do' - and it was delivered very powerfully. I have to make a special mention about the cinematography. It was awesome. It used the restricted depth of field approach in several shots, and yet did not give a feeling that it was overused.At this point, I should probably mention something about me. The last Hindi movie I really liked was Taare Zameen Par the one before that was Dil Chahta Hai, and the one before that was probably Mr. India. So you should understand that I am typically not generous with praises for Bollywood. So when I say Rock On rocked on, it means something.Now's the time to nitpick. And here on, there's gonna be some spoilers. This basically means that if you HAVEN'T watched the movie yet, you should probably throw a rock at the monitor, cover your eyes, and jump behind the couch over there so that you get to enjoy the movie properly when you DO see it. Alternatively, you can use this time to actually go get the tickets and hop in a theater seat with popcorn. When you return, you'll be well equipped to read the rest of this article.The plot was smooth, except for a few things that detracted my attention. Firstly, the big fight  What was that all about? For guys who are all that pally with each other, the situation had NOT developed into such a state as to demand a ten year hiatus. They took a guy fight and treated it like a darned girl fight.You know what I mean Except for certain really extreme lines getting crossed (such as stealing each other's make up or not) guys get over such fights after two days and a mug of beer. And while I can understand that Farhan Akhtar has a short temper, it's still a far stretch to imagine that when one of his closest friends hit him, he just packs up and leaves music and starts over a new life...?? The build up to the fight kept implying that it was something huge... We were dropped hints of Farhan betraying friends, great ego clashes building up, and something mysterious that was so sinister that everything turned topsy turvy after the fight. And the fight actually didn't give anything on that scale. OK, things were turning sour, Farhan was starting to build an ego, sure.. but it was just starting... I expected something AT LEAST as heated as the band split in 'That Thing You Do'.... The lead singer was ACTUALLY building an ego.... starting to feel he carried the entire weight of the band, and that the rest didn't really matter, etc etc... Nothing like that happened here. It seemed so out of character, so out of place.But... remember what I said.. These are just nitpicks... Even with this bump on the road, the movie was nothing short of brilliant." 
" Could usher in the start of a new bollywood genre....Excellent and Enjoyable!!!!","Farhan Akhtar has done it again! Rock On is an excellent movie and one that I would definitely would not mind watching again, in fact I am definitely going to go again. Just like how Dil Chahta Hai started a new movement in Indian cinema, I am sure that now, more projects of the same type will start coming out of the woodwork. I just hope that they can measure upto the quality of Rock On.The casting was good and the ensemble cast gave great performances. Purab kohli, Luke and Arjun Rampal were all good although Arjun Rampal was still a bit stiff with the guitar in hand. On the other hand Farhan looked like an absolute natural playing the guitar, he had excellent stage presence as the lead singer. As for the heroines, Suhana and Prachi were good although I quite liked the former, she has striking looks and has pretty good acting chops. Hope to see more of her in the future.Farhan Akhtar was excellent, in my opinion he has given a subtle but pitch perfect performance that was very natural. It should put several veterans of the big screen to shame......I won't name any names but just imagine some of our existing Bollywood heroes hamming it up on stage and compare them with the Farhan performance.The music was excellent. How good does it feel to look at an actor actually singing his own songs........so much more real and I am sure that it helped Farhan to take his performance to new heights. Akhtar's singing wasn't perfect but it had the raw quality which went well with the overall feel and theme of the movie. SEL & javed Akhtar also deserve their plaudits. I don't see why people were complaining about the music.Abhishek the director has to be given a lot of credit for the final product, which although has a lot of clichés still manages to hold our attention and makes us root for his characters. Well done.....hope he will not come up with a damp squib after this.Farhan Akhtar has become one of the few film personalities in Indian cinema whose name has become synonymous with high quality films. When I see Farhan Akhtar's name attached to a product either as a director or a producer then I would definitely make the time to see the film as I would in the case of Hollywood names such as Steven Spielberg or a Denzel Washington. Fine, he is not in the same league yet but now that Farhan has added the acting feather to his cap we can expect high quality output from him as an actor as well as as a director and a producer." 
" It Rocked........Beautifully","I am very much into rock music and surprisingly this movie was as good as it can be.no comparisons with other movies about band like school of rock et al,but this movie holds its originality in the simplicity of presentation,nice direction and above all an incredible musical effort which is in all ways new to normal bollywood films and viewers too.Basic plot is the old formula of friends breaking up and reuniting, but in this case with the backdrop of a rock band,plot gets a twist. Farhaan did an excellent job as an actor as well as a vocalist but incredible is the effort put in by Arjun rampal.Man he can act and he proved it.in fact the couple(joe and Debbie) acted really well.on the other hand Kiran desai(saakshi) does a decent job and looked really cute and graceful.Purab(KD) was good as expected and does his job wonderfully.Luke(rob)didn't have much space but he was alright. Shankar Ehsaan Loy the trio delivers again and what can we ask more.music was simply brilliant and refreshing. Abhishek kapoor the director was decent and cared for one thing very much i.e movie should remain accessible and simple without any larger than life scenes or slippery plots(weakness of bollywood directors.come bollywood and an item no. is guaranteed).except that tumor twist everything else was free of melodrama. So ROCK ON!! did rocked and as farhaan said at music launch party that he will try to expose normal bollywood to a new face of music,well he succeeded. one of the best movies of year,will remain in memories for its music,friendship and inspirational theme,(not to forget scenes like that of rocking dandia) So Rock On!!.Live Your Dreams" 
" Dil Chahta Hain meets Jhankaar Beats","Ode to Dil Chahta Hain:: √ Farhan Akhtar plays an extended version of Akash.√ Arjun Rampal reprises Sid.√ Turn Dimple Kapadia into a male character and add them into a trio  voila, you have DCH of four! √ The misunderstanding/ breakup.√ The final moments before the credits rolls.√ The past narrated in flashback.Well, one should appreciate the makers were honest to admit publicly that the movie was DCH Part Deux.Performances:: √ Farhan Akhtar:: He doesn't falter a bit and delivers an eye-opener performance in terms of the subtle nuances and body language he bring in. Of course, his distinct voice is his his greatest asset. Hindsight, he should have done "Lucky" in Main Hoon Na, at least the role would have been more memorable.√ Arjun Rampal:: Probably first time one would take notice of his performance as it is very matured and restrained. Lets hope it does what DCH did to Akshaye Khanna.√ Purab Kohli, Luke Kenny & Shahana Goswami:: Should capitalise on the success of the movie to get a strong foothold in Bollywood. Good performances otherwise.√ Prachi Desai is good in her "Miss Goody Two Shoes" role. BTW  why was her character a bit pushy towards male bonding? √ Koel Purie is as usual OK.Too many flashbacks hinder the narrative. Should have been confined to a single one.The songs would take sometime to catch on as they belong to Rock genre and not the usual run-out-of mill.The protagonists passion for music give you a feel of Jhankaar Beats and so does the climax.The movie is handled extremely well on all technical fronts. A very well made movie. Looking forward your next outing Gattu Kapoor! PS: Javed Saab, does the usage of "Darling" refer to a previous experience of your in the Bollywood?" 
" Not as rocking as expected","For the most part, "Rock On!!", though engagingly realistic and well-acted, is not a particularly rocking movie. Considering it's about a rock band, the film is fairly slow and at times even tedious. There is some depressing feel to it although the viewer may clearly feel the light in the end of a tunnel will certainly come at some point. What I really liked about this film, however, is the portrayal of relationships. I think it was very well done, and it was the film's best-depicted aspect. It was actually the main aspect which pushed the otherwise unmovable narrative forward. The film's concept is interesting, but not really new or unused. It's neither intriguing nor unpredictable.The performances are good in this order: Shahana Goswami is mind-blowing as Debbie. She is an excellent actress with a very natural and intense style and a particularly forceful dialogue delivery. This clearly is the best performance of the film. Arjun Rampal's is the best performance among the male cast, and he is thoroughly convincing in a role that is essentially a very passive one. Prachi Desai acts very well and she is vulnerable and convincing throughout the film. Farhan Akhtar makes a good debut, nothing outstanding though. He is a bit wooden in some scenes, but otherwise okay, and he actually sings very well. Purab Kohli is effective but does not really get that much of a scope."Rock On!!" is a one-time watch for me. It has its moments, it has good acting, the music is excellent, but the story is not very well executed. I felt there was much more to show and much more to tell about the rock band. It is done quite realistically and does not go over the top, but it has its share of clichés, unreasonable coincidences and ancient emotions, which neither move nor impress. Nevertheless, I liked the rather positive ending, which in spite of its predictability was quite efficient. The final verdict is above average according to me. I expected something else, but it's just me, watch it and make your own conclusions."
