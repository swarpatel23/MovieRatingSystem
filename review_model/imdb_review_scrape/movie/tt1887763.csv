" Decent movie.","It is a nice attempt by Vikram Bhatt. Good acting skills shown by lead actors. Story is different from regular horror movies and no beating about the bush is there. The central part of the movie is the emotion and pain of the actress. Thats is heard superbly in the track 'Sau baras guzre'. There aren't any superb extremely scary horror scenes. I feel the emotional part of the movie took over the horror part and scenes are loaded with emotions, if watched in true sense of a movie without any prior expectations related to the element of scare or horror. Overall, its a one-time watch movie. Enjoy India's first stereoscopic 3D horror flick. This is my personal opinion about the movie. NOM to anyone." 
" better than 1920 and even MOST of Indian horror movies","I'm not gonna lie...but I had little expectation from this movie...the actors were all new and the story looked similar to that of 1920 and movies of the (EXORCISM) theme... The movie was quite good....actually better than 1920 ....the acting could have been better(specially female lead(Mira)) but I understand ,all the actors were new and it was a job well done at last. The movie had some scares and amazing scenes ...but the best part of the movie was a beautiful love story amidst a disturbing horror tale.In fact, the strength and dominance of the love story overshadows the horror element at some occasions.This movie however, didn't forget to add a little Indian touch to it despite the fact that the director tried to make it look pretty Americanised.If 1920 was a classy horror movie....this was maybe classier and the 3D did nothing but adding positives to the movie. The soundtracks were awesome and the cinematography was classy like 1920. horror element-7/10 acting-5/10 script-8/10 direction-6/10 soundtrack-7/10 IN short, don't miss it...:)" 
" Scary & Entertaining...","Vikram Bhatt's 'Haunted 3D', is Horror at its best! Being the first stereoscopic film of India, this scary tale, offers scary moments all through and holds you with it's interesting screenplay. Fear, indeed goes 3D! 'Haunted 3D' tells the story of Rehan, played by Mahaakshay, a real-estate broker, who comes to sell an ancient haunted mansion in a secluded hill-station, but later finds out there is more to this mansion than expected.Amin Hajee's Writing in the First-Hour is superb! The haunting the protagonist goes through, throw chills down your spine & keeps your interest alive. In the second hour, an unexpected twist happens and only gathers it's momentum and reaches to a long, yet good culmination.Vikram Bhatt is a Master when it comes to Making Horror Flicks, and 'Haunted 3D' proves that fact yet again. This one's a terrific horror flick, that is eerie, creepy & interesting at the same time. The 3D effects are quite good.Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is fine. Music is wonderful, each song has a feel to it.Performance-Wise: Mahaakshay, earlier known as Mimoh, who debuted in 'Jimmy' a few years back, shows vast improvement in here. As the Main Hero, the lad delivers a sincere performance from start to end. Debutant Tia Bajpai is quite good. Achint Kaur leaves a lasting impression. Arif Zakaria is fantastic! The actor manages to cause a terror within you each time he appears on screen! Mohan Kapoor is fair. Sanjay Sharma is passable.On the whole, 'Haunted 3D' is a must watch for those who love Horror Flicks!" 
" Nice movie","Another Vikram Bhatt magic horror Flick after 1920,Shaapit & Raaz.But the surprising thing is Mimoh (Mithun's son)'s acting.The girl also acted well and the ghost also acted well. Some potion of movie(mainly makeup and horror activities) is inspired from Exorcist(which is common for every horror movie).But its not a bad thing..Because Exorcist is the benchmark. The story is interesting.A ghost can not safe herself from another ghost.Music is good.Direction is top notch.Camera work is also good.Now waiting 4 Vikram Bhatt'r next horror Flick-Raaz 3 :DMy rating for this movie 9/10Must watch this movie" 
" Terrific Hindi Horror","Its a superb horror movie. I think Raaz and 1920 which are also Directed by Vikram Bhatt are very good.Shapit was an average horror.But Haunted is the best in lot. It is chilling an scary.The atmosphere in the big old haunted house is creepy.Special effects and sound effects are great and cinematography is beautiful.Very good use of silence which we usually see in other Asian and Hollywood movies. There are some jump scenes which are also very effective and all the actors give good performance.Downside of this film I feel some unnecessary extra songs which actually drag the the film a little. Maybe Some Spoiler:-- BEGIN:-- The story is bit different and its time traveling concept in second half (END OF SPOILER) may not be liked by some people but its not bad and very entertaining.All in all its a very good horror film and all Horror fans should watch this film to get some good chills and genuine scares." 
" Scary in 3D","First of all if you've seen earlier Vikram Bhatt's flicks and you liked it, you will like it as well. The story remains almost on the same theme as earlier but this times it come with the 3d effect. The movie visually is very appealing with all the make ups and effects. It lacks on the verge on sound effects. Being the first stereoscopic horror movie it achieves it and manages to thrill the audience. It has some scary moments and the 3d effect enhances them on a vast scale. The romantic side is well stuffed in. The 3d effects are commendable. Overall I would recommend at least one watch for the great effort. If you love the horror genre you would like it." 
" Much Better than Expected. Satisfaction Guaranteed.","Some reviews which I found on internet are misleading which says negative about movie. As the movie has Vikram Bhats tag attached, it's his one of the best horror films compared to earlier "1920" and "Shaapit". I loved the storyline, it's something different. 3D effects are up-to the mark what Indian movies can expect. Also like Vikram Bhat's earlier movies, this too take you to the pre-independence era. There are many HORROR n CHILLING scenes which will scare you along with weird scream scenes. Better leading actor and actress should have been casted, but anyways new actor and actress too have performed well. In brief, this film has all the elements what Indian MASALA horror film should consist of. I recommend this movie for ADULTS who love horror movies." 
" Very Good movie.... True Horror..... Superb acting...... World's best direction.... Awesum music","2 weeks ago a channel aired Haunted movie and I was waiting as I saw 1920 just a day back and found it quite interesting though so my expectations were a bit higher than 1920.I watched this movie and found it beyond the expectations. Beautiful location, sets, weather keeps you glued to your seat and that's what you need at initial. As there was no well known face so it gets that edge which is required in horror flick. The movie flows in sweet manner and changes the track wisely. You know everything about situations. This is quality of director that he explains everything to the audience so that nobody annoys you "Hey, what was that, How?...Why?" and you give annoyed looks with anger to the fellow as he/she interrupts and never let you focus on.Every actor did a great job even small role guys did their best jobs and you compare everyone as equal.Movie goes back to 1936 and here is the best part. Old age clothes and British culture revolves in front of your eyes and you are ready to feel deep inside the movie.The ghost is very good and situations are really scary. This movie never gets offbeat and gives you true feel of horror.Music is awesome that's why I am listening it for past 3 weeks over and over.If you have plan for your weekend to sit at home it's better to watch movie and take nap because you were in a beautiful and successful dream which was India's first 3D Stereographic movie.Best Regards," 
" "Haunts your senses with excellent 3-D effect"","Haunted is a spine chilling 3-D extravaganza offered by Vikram Bhatt.The director has created another enjoyable horror flick after movies like raaz,1920 etc and has an excellent combination of horror and technical perfection.The movie does entertain the viewers,but the storyline is seen many a time before and may result in a less critical acclaim for it.The 2.15 hour long movie is a visual treat for the mass viewers who look for entertainment and not recommended for the critics who look for story inside the story and so.Synopsis::Rehan,a real-estate broker comes to sell an haunted mansion which has a sympathetic story behind it and tries to unlock the mystery there.Performances::Mahakshay Chakraborthy(earlier Mimoh Chakraborthy) has certainly grown up in his acting skills from his debut movie Jimmy,but can improve more.Tia Bajpai(Sa re ga ma pa challenge fame) has done her role with full commitment and requires appreciation.Arif Zakaria does another good job as he have always done before.Music by Chirantan Bhatt is absolutely brilliant and amazing(my personal favorite album of 2011) and the songs are really soothing to the ears.All the songs ranging from a hearty ""Tum ho mera pyar " by K.K to an ear-haunting Sau baras by Tia Bajpai are excellently crafted and deserves a 9/10.Some +ves::An excellent background score and hummable music.*The entertaining Full-3d effects,which is a novel experience for Indian viewers,who could witness it only in Avatar before.*Some good horror scenes,which make you jump off the seats.*Cinematography by Praveen Bhatt which is catchy for the eyes of the viewers.Some -ves::The similarity of plot to films like Hawa.*The lengthy narration of the movie.*Some scenes in the first half, which are too graphic.Verdict::Haunted is a visual treat for the mass viewers,who goes to the cinema hall to get entertainment only.The plot may be old and seen before,but is sure to scare you and is paisa vasool.Ma Rating::8/10" 
" Serene, logical, horror with ample good unpredictable turns.","This movie is really good. Mostly, it is just so easy to sit back in a chair and pass criticism for other's work. And I mean, bad one... there are really few who appreciate others' hardwork. And, really, the story, acting, direction; lets say, movie as whole is not ... err.. stupid. That said, Mahakshay has shown improvement here. The twists and turns of movie are good. And though the constant running of the protagonist and the OCD of the 'Evil Spirit' with (you find out what) strike amusing at times, I found the idea really digestible. So, the one's trying to put logic above all would IMHO not be disappointed. I didn't get the chance to watch it in 3D, but the scenes like 'snake' and 'ghost chase' would definitely render good, hence, recommend you to take the 3D pick." 
" Excellent movie with a great story and ending","Wow. Can't imagine that I just watched a Bollywood horror flick that is absolutely amazing and flawless.Hats off to the writer (Amin Hajee) and director (Vikram Bhatt). I loved 1920 and considered it to the best Indian horror movie but after watching Haunted I feel this one is slightly better with a solid writing and a very engrossing screenplay.The acting by all the actors was top class. Songs and background score were fantastic. Those who enjoy horror stuff should not miss this one.I hope Vikram Bhatt and camp would stick to the same formula of doing non-vulgar and non-erotic stuff (1920, Shaapit and Haunted) and I am sure they will succeed next time as well.I am going to watch Haunted a few more times." 
" Great turning point in Indian Horror","Vikram Bhatt as once again proved his excellent work by making another horror movie in all different style. Just to add a pinch of spice, this time its 3D. I was very impressed my Vikram Bhatt's previous work in 1920 and Raaz, and this he as even proved to be better. The performance of Mimoh Chakraborty and Tia Bajpai is up to the mark. Even though few concepts in the movie makes you think how can it be possible, like- Ghost are powerful after 3am, How do Rehan goes to past(1936)?, i will take it as granted. The movie as many chilling effects and visuals to be admired. Overall, a must watchable and more over Enjoyable too.. Cheers.." 
" Audio sound is perfect.","I did not want to watch this movie but song Tera he Hona Chahou made me to watch this movie. Story does not meet reality but it has some awesome features. Although in starting story seems interesting but it has some visual errors. The most interesting and very likening thing in this is Audio effects with original mixing capability. When hearing with great devotion I feel same situation occurring with me. The negative point is that it does not match much with visuals but it correspondence is okay but not as it would be. Actress is Twinkle Bajpai who won Singing competition in 2005 held by Zee TV, has Twinkling debut as her name indicates. She has performed as she was a professional and an experienced. I gave 10/10 to Twinkle Bajpai but Male actor does not meet excellency. So, therefor I gave him 7/10. I would recommended this movie." 
" Amazing!!!","I've watched it so many times and every time it's fresh!" 
" Rehan crushes over Meera who is a spirit and is trapped by another spirit,but the question is how will he save his love who is not alive.","the movie keeps your glued to the sits throughout and is quiet a lot entertaining.Rehan -Mahakshay Chakraborty- is sent to a mansion by his father -Sagar Saikia-, who is in the real estate business. The mansion's caretaker died two days ago, and the mansion is going to be sold off in ten days. Rehan's father suspects this as the doing of a rival real estate company, so he sends Rehan to investigate. He meets a rag-picker on the way who tells him that only he can do it. Mysterious things happen that night. Rehan sees a girl playing piano who vanishes when the door is opened; a book drops from a bookshelf on its own and Rehan finds a letter inside. The letter, written by Meera -Tia Bajpai-, tells her story from 1936 when her parents left for Delhi and left her alone with her nanny Margaret-Achint Kaur-, a servant and a driver. In the absence of her parents, her piano teacher Iyer -Arif Zakaria- tries to rape her. However, she saves herself by hitting Iyer with a candle stand on his head, which results in his death. Soon, the police corroborate Meera's story, as they find explicit sketches of her in Iyer's house. However, Iyer returns in the form of an evil spirit, killing both the servants and the nanny. The spirit rapes Meera repeatedly, which leads her to commit suicide, but even after her death her spirit is tortured and trapped in the mansion by the evil spirit.After reading the letter, Rehan feels sympathetic and brings a psychic to help, but the lady leaves after realizing how strong the evil spirit is and asks Rehan to do the same. Rehan ignores her warning and stays there, challenging the evil spirit by saying its name as it is believed that saying an evil spirit's name makes it more powerful.The next morning when he wakes up he finds the rag-picker in front of him, casting a spell. The spell sends him back 75 years to 17 August 1936, the day when Meera's parents leave for Delhi. Rehan befriends Meera by following her and pretending to be lost newcomer to the town. The next day, in order to prevent the death of Iyer, Rehan comes to Meera's house with a basket of chocolates as a gift for showing him the way to the city. Rehan says that he would like to listen to Meera's performance as he is also interested in music, but Iyer asks him to leave. Rehan insists on staying outside the door so that he will not interfere in their class and can still listen to the music. As Rehan listens to the music, Iyer hits him, throwing him out on the lawn. Iyer bolts the door from inside and tries to rape Meera while Rehan tries to prevent Iyer's death. But, as written in fate, Meera kills Iyer. A hurt Rehan is admitted to the hospital where he dreams about the evil spirit.Rehan explains everything to Meera and asks her to meet him the next day at noon. The next day, Rehan, Meera and Margaret meet a priest, who tells them that far from the town there is a Dargah, a mosque where there is a Sufi baba who could help them. He tells them to start the journey at 3:00 pm because spirits have the strongest power at 3:00 am and are weakest at 3:00 pm. As the travelling continues into dusk, the three stay in a hotel, but the evil spirit kills Margaret and tries to rape Meera. Rehan fights it and takes Meera the rest of the way to the Dargah. The next day, the priest is killed by a snake. Margaret's body, now possessed by the spirit, tries to stop them from entering the Dargah, but Rehan manages to put Margaret's leg at the doorstep of the Dargah thereby destroying her body. Inside they find the rag-picker who sent Rehan into the past.He tells them that miles away is a town that was being chanted by Khwaja, and there is a well in which Meera has to show the way to Iyer's spirit, which is connected to Meera by a blood-stained pendant that Meera is still wearing. As they reach the town, Rehan has to drop the fire, mud, and the pendent. As Rehan is performing the act, Meera is attacked by Iyer, but Meera manages to throw the pendant in the well. After saving her, Rehan falls into the well and reaches back to the year 2011. He finds another letter in the same place and discovers that Meera lived a happy life after that event. The house is no longer haunted. many element are found like sadness violence comedy drama.the lead actors emotions are found all over the place.with outstanding storyline and superb acting by female lead and the spirit ayer it a good movie to watch again and again.locations are very well chose.i give this interesting movie 10/10.trust me its worth watching." 
" Typical Vikram Bhatt style horror in 3D","Vikram Bhatt's first horror film Raaz was a huge hit and then after flops he returned with 1920, Shaapit Haunted 3D was the first horror film in stereoscopic 3D As per me the first film in 3D was Chota Chethan(1996) but as per media it is Haunted. The film has the typical hangover of Vikram Bhatt's films this time with something different about time travel thatz all We have the same mix of blind faith and paranormal activities. The film takes place in a mansion(predictabily) where Mahaakshay(earlier named Mimoh in Jimmy his debut film) comes to see and then what happens. After HAWA(2003) here we have a ghost raping the heroine and then the second half shows how Mahaakshay goes back and tries to save her. There are some scary scenes but some are predictable like the chandelliers falling down, Doors open, screeching noises.etc The film does gather steam towards the end and alls well till we reach the dargah though it is little difficult to understand why the ghost gets so vulnerable suddenly often taking long time to attack? but such things are forgiven in horror films. Post the dargah the film drags 30 mins more and we are thrown in some well and dingy area where the heroine again is attacked and finally all ends well. There are some flaws with the film like the hero and heroine suddenly breaking into a song when life is at stake? Also some scenes are unintentionally funnyDirection by Vikram Bhatt is good in many scenes Music is okay 3D effects are good better then many Hindi filmsMahaakshay(name changed after Jimmy failure) seems to have improved after his terrible debut, but still has to improve more He has to loosen up more, work on his weight and expressions His voice is dubbed by Vikram Bhatt(mostly in his films he dubs for actors) Tia Bajpai in her debut gives a good performance Achint Kaur is superb, Mohan Kapoor, Arif Jackeria are good in their roles The actor playing sufi baba is good, while Prachi Shah(seen in kyunki saas) is superb"
