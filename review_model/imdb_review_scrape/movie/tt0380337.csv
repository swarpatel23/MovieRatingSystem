" its a bad bad bad plagiarism","Plagiarized version of "Lola Rennt" and on top of it this movie is badly done. Director should be taught how to make a plagiarized movie leave alone a genuine one. He f***ed it up so badly. Nandita looks tired and weather beaten on deserted streets of mumbai(??)!! She can't run for nuts.  My suggestion is don't see this movie. Its absolutely worthless. Rahul Bose should not have taken this movie." 
" What a waste","I rented this because I like Nandita Das and Rahul Bose and the synopsis on Netflix said it was an "opus" with a different take on Bollywood. What we got was shoddy acting, camera-work, cinematography, editing, directing, and not a single redeeming factor. Even the screen colors change randomly. The story begins and ends on a whim. The concept of narrative thread is apparently lost on the director and any similarities to "Run Lola Run", while intentional, do injustice to the classic in this horror freak-show. Rahul and Nandita would have been better utilized in a school play. I could have sworn that this movie was made by a four-person crew, two of whom were stoned. Bad movie. Bad bad movie. And I'm the kind of person who likes bad Indian movies." 
" Nandita Das is totally wasted in this crappy film","I wonder what made an intelligent actress (not a heroine) like Nandita Das who gave powerful performances in 1947 Earth and Fire act in such a mindless so-called 'thriller'. Ek Din 24 Ghante leaves so much to expect. I watched this film because I thought it would be an intelligent Indian adaptation of the German film 'Run Lola Run'. However, I was totally let down by the shoddy screenplay, dialogues and last but not the least, ACTING. Though I must appreciate the director's effort of Westernizing the movie by making it much shorter than the usual run-of-the-mill Bollywood movies. The film does feel like a breath of fresh air with no song and minimal dialogues in some situations but even the lines spoken by the characters are not up to the mark. Editing and camera-work are sloppy and i better not say anything about the choppy direction.Avoid!!!" 
" a sorry excuse for a movie","Having seen both Rahul Bose and Nandita Das in Indian Film Festivals in LA, my regard for both of them stands shaken after watching this film - or a poor excuse for one.I mean, there was no turn left un-stoned in this movie. Looks like they decided to make the worst movie they could (although it's based on the marginally popular "Run, Lola, Run", from the beginning. OK. That might be a little harsh and I do know that the actors have little say in how a movie eventually turns out.. but, even then, this one is a waste of time.The single worst part of the movie is it's MUSIC. It is a mix of 70's porn music, clich√©d old Hindi film riffs and cheap homemade synthesizer music. It is completely incongruous to what's happening on screen and my friends and I agreed that the movie actually made better sense with muted sound.Following closely in second position is the SOUND. Apparently, they must have run out of money half way, because only half the sounds were accounted for! I don't really want to get technical but, in my opinion, the sound recording engineer must have been sleeping when making this movie.Although I haven't even begun talking about the characters, the story line, and delivery, I think I have spent more time on this than I can afford. Hope Rahul and Nandita can be more careful in their choice of films in the future." 
" Can anyone say "Lola rennt"","Yet again we have a bad copy on our hands. u would think that after the HUGH flop of Kantee will teach bollywood that bad copies just dont work! but this time the credit is that they have stolen from a german movie Run Lola Run, the similarities are obvious but a bit dumbed down in lemans terms. not5 worth ur time if u have seen the original might like it if u haven't but, compared to the fast paced story of  Lola rennt its really boring, and i cant BELIVE Rahul Bose agreed to do this movie, he can do a hell lot better."
