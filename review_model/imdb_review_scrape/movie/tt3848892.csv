" A thriller that India will always be proud of !","Though I don't categorize movies on the basis of their region or country, I had mentioned this title regarding India being proud of this movie. This is because I have heard people yelling in social media and in public about the low standards of Indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied from Hollywood. I agree to them o most occasions but this one. And I would strongly recommend people who complain about the lack of good movies in Bollywood to go and watch it. Or else stop complaining these craps.Coming on to the movie, it describes the biggest agenda world is facing right now, i.e, Terrorism, in best way it could. The story comprises of many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel the smooth flow of script. We are lost in the hustle going on in front of us and are keen to know what is coming next. First half makes the plot for the movie and the second half unleashes the execution. Each and every scenes complements its predecessor and we are biting our nails without even noticing it. Last hour is full of thrilling actions and grueling proceedings.Talking about the acting , I must say Akshay Kumar has delivered a role of his life very convincingly. He lives his character and puts that extra amount of thrill via his superb action. Danny plays his role quite brilliantly. Anupam, Tapsee, Kay Kay and other supporting casts act life to their characters and make this movie a combo of power packed performances.Director Neeraj Pandey has already made a Wednesday and Sp 26 in past and thats why there was a very little scope for improvement for him. But I would be lying if i don't say that this is a notch higher that his earlier masterpieces. Editing is quite crisp. Screenplay is the soul of this movie while BM is equally engaging. Cinematography is grand and deserve applause. Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Music is average and rightly so. Choreography is nil while action is breathtaking.It has a few flaws here and there in a few scenes but those are hardly noticed due to the fast paced drama and screenplay.Overall, a standing ovation for Neeraj and Akshay to give us Indians a movie to feel proud of. It can easily go into books as one of the best Hindi movies.A movie of Hollywood standard and execution. And who knows Akshay might get a shot at his dream of wining a National Award. I won't be surprised if he gets one along with Neeraj Pandey. It also has a potential to be India's official Oscar entry next year.I have rated this movie comparing it to other Indian movies...otherwise I would universally give it a 9 or 9.5." 
" And Bollywood delivers a rare gem!!!","If you are a Ek tha tiger, Dhoom 3, HNY, Bang Bang fanboy/girl, do not watch this movie and do not read this review either, it's just not for you. Akshay Kumar do not need to romance hot girls, do not need to dance and sing, do not need to do melodrama to deliver a hit movie, he had shown us this back in Special 26, he has done the same here in Baby. The cast is a perfect one and there are no flaws.MOVIE: It has everything a good espionage thriller need to have- 1. Good cop bad cop routine 2. Cute chick beating the pulp out of the bad guy 3. Super cool combat scenes 4. No unnecessary sentiments and drama 5. Some brilliant dialogues 6. few laugh out loud scenes 7. It focuses on modern warfare--an indirect one--proxy war, which is much spoken about in reference to India in recent times 8. Kick ass background score 9. Cool Spy v/s bad guys 10. funny Akshay Anupam Kher duoOn negatives: Yes even i think the movie was a bit lengthy, if the director had trimmed it 10-15 minutes it would had been great. Yet, this movie is a rare feat. Bollywood rarely delivers movies like this. Its a must watch if you like sensible movies. And regarding the negative reviews, just do not pay any heed to them, for THIS GEM IS NOT TO BE MISSED. Neeraj Pandey as a director has done a brilliant job." 
" Masterpiece. Had it was made in Hollywood, would have found its way to Oscars.","Its rare, in its extremity, for Bollywood to make a masterpiece. But once in a while they do and this year Neeraj Pandey and Akshya Kumar gave a classic like "BABY". Every scene, background score,cinematography and almost everything is done to perfection. And that second half will glue you to your seat! such a thrill, such a tension,the effort put by director is so brilliant that you will feel like cheering up. None of the characters are wasted. Everyone has a important part to play in. The acting is superb. Everyone, and I mean literally everyone has acted so well that sometime you feel like you are not even watching a movie. Anyone who loves watching Bollywood movies, should not miss this classic. It's a classic, a masterpiece and kind of movie that is made once in a decade. Simply stating it, Its one of the finest movie ever made in Bollywood." 
" Best Film Of Akshay Kumar..If u like real movies must watch it","What's Good: It's an out an out Neeraj Pandey film. Baby hands down comes out as of the best films when it comes to mixing a subject like terrorism. It is like an Indian version of Body Of Lies.What's Bad: Almost nothing. I don't know any better way this film could have been presented.Loo break: Don't move!Watch or Not?: Baby is a definite watch for anyone who likes action thrillers. With an edge of the seat course of story, it is a treat with its dialogues too. Baby is a must-watch film with rich content. This action thriller will woo you if you are a fan of watching raw action where blood spills and guns are trotted. An honest work that dares to bare terrorism and its religious connection. What I loved most about the film was its quality to hook you a" 
" One of the Best!! Well... at least the Second Half is!","I'm a movie buff and watch almost every movie. Last time, I was so excited about a movie was when I saw Ugly! Talking about Neeraj Pandey, I'm among those very people who didn't find the climax of Special Chabbees exciting. In fact, I was able to guess the finale long before it started. And so for me, the finale was the weakest link in Special Chhabees. For A Wednesday, it was a great thriller from start till end.Now coming to the Baby! The first half started with bang and I was really looking forward to the movie. However, right about the interval, I was thinking that it wasn't all that great! And that's where I was wrong. With the entry of Taapsee Pannu, started a race against time. And here's where Neeraj Pandey really really blew my mind. That's how a thriller is made. Stupid movies like Race 2 ought to learn from this movie. The second half kept me at the edge of my seat that seldom any Hindi movie does.Kudos to the Baby team for contributing such a gem to Indian Cinema. Thrillers like A Wednesday, Ugly, and Baby are a rare treat to movie goers like me, who just can't leave their brains at home. The critics can find all the fault they want in this movie, but for me it's one of Neeraj's best.Akshay did a very good job. He is a versatile actor who should do more sensible movies instead of movies like Once Upon A Time In Mumbai - 2. But I'm all praise for Tapsee Pannu. Unlike every Telugu movie, where the heroine is a Bimbo, Tapsee showed her acting prowess with this movie. Anupam Kher was excellent as always. Not much can be said about Rana Daggubati as his role wasn't meaty enough! All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Will definitely see again on Silver Screen, too! Urge you all to watch this movie if you really want a fast paced Indian thriller." 
" An Engrossing Film!","Neeraj Pandey's 'Baby' is a another winner from the Writer-Director. An Engrossing Film, that serves as an impressive espionage action thriller. Its well-paced & also well-acted! 2015...has clearly got its first winner! 'Baby' Synopsis: A group of Indian Patriots, track down Muslim Terrorists, who are planning a series of bomb blasts. 'Baby' has a decent first-hour, where the drama & the brutal action-sequences leave a mark. But, its the second-hour, which is a complete knock-out. The final 40-minutes especially, when our heroes capture the kingpin & plan to get him back home, offer nail-biting moments. Despite a long running-time of over 158-minutes, 'Baby' makes very good use of its length! Pandey's Screenplay is strong all through. The first-hour isn't without its moments, but the Second-Hour takes the narrative to an all time high. Pandey's Direction is equally competent. Cinematography is lavish, it captures the exotic locales of Istanbul, Nepal, Dubai & India, admirably. Editing is a bit loose at times, but is otherwise crisp. Action-Sequences are raw, but effective. Background Score is superb. Performance-Wise: Akshay Kumar is in top-form. Its so nice to see the talented actor donning a serious role, after a hiatus. He's tough throughout. Anupam Kher, who enters the scene pretty late, is remarkable. His scenes with Akshay provide genuine humor. Danny Denzongpa is superb. Rana Daggubati & Taapsee Pannu are decent in brief roles. Kay Kay Menon, Sushant Singh & Rasheed Naz are menacing as the conniving villains.On the whole, 'Baby' works big time. Grab a ticket now!" 
" Best film by Akshay Kumar till date","This is one of the best movies ever made in thriller category. Akshay has done brilliant stunts in this movie. The dialogues were incredible. This is a movie that you can watch with your family and get a message out of it too. I totally recommend you to watch this movie. It will impress you as much as Special 26 did. This movie will be a blockbuster. That's all i have to say! REPEAT*** Don't read this******* This is one of the best movies ever made in thriller category. Akshay has done brilliant stunts in this movie. The dialogues were incredible. This is a movie that you can watch with your family and get a message out of it too. I totally recommend you to watch this movie. It will impress you as much as Special 26 did. This movie will be a blockbuster. That's all i have to say!" 
" Perhaps the best spy action thriller in Bollywood","Baby is Bollywood's answer to Argo!!!!!!!!! The entire plot has been amazingly crafted. The performance of the entire cast was amazing. Bollywood rarely produces movies nowadays that are watchable, and in between comes this gem of a movie. The first half of the movie is good. However the real plot comes into play in the second half. The last 45-50 minutes of the the movie were so engaging that I could not remove my eyes from the theater screen. And the biggest merit of the film is the fact that there are no songs in the movie, only background music is there.Akshay Kumar has played a superb role. Its time that he should realize the fact that he looks really amazing doing films like holiday, baby and Special 26, and that he should stop doing mindless commercial movies. Danny and Anupam Kher are great at their roles. The action scenes are amazing, and cinematography is good. The best part of the movie is its direction. Neeraj Pandey has made two awesome movies earlier, and with this film he sets the standards even higher. Why cant Bollywood have more of Neeraj Pandeys and Hiranis and Anurag Kashyaps? Why cant Bollywood churn even two quality films every month?Kudos to Neeraj Pandey, Akshay Kumar and co....." 
" Excellent","Really well directed and excellent movie. Different approach and most important is the gripping story line and narration. A "MUST WATCH" movie in theater. The cinematography is good and is a delight to watch and synchronizes well with the movie. And needless to say, one of plus points of the movie is Akshay Kumar's acting as an authentic security officer. Taapsee is a delight to watch. Rana Daggubati's acting is also very good and has done a very good job as another security officer. The storyline and the plot are new and refreshing which highly complements the movie. The songs are good and matches well with the movie without boring or torturing the audience. If you liked the songs in Neeraj Pandey's previous movie "Special 26", then you are sure to like this too, actually the songs are even more good in Baby. And, needless to tell about "Neeraj Pandey", the director who has given us epics like "A Wednesday" and "Special 26". He has just proved his mettle yet again." 
" Finally, The Bollywood has grown up","With all the speculations around that one day Bollywood might come up with some consistent performances in thriller genre. Hello Hello there freaks,Its here. After some rare genuine thrills like D-Day, Special chabbis, Madras Cafe and Holiday in last couple of Years, we have yet another from Mr.Neeraj Pandey. His previous films were some, the Indian public hate to see-Sensible genuine thrills. Thanks to some stubborn directors,the mindset in last few years have changed. Coming to the movie,Baby,its yet another thriller which is surely gonna give you some lasting goosebumps. Incredibly written and directed from master Pandey,the movie portrays a secret organisation,Baby, formed after 26/11 which shocked the world. The Org. aims at exterminating the post terror attacks in India. Following a strict policy of "If caught,No claims from Indian Government",it shows what a real Spy agency has to go throw before capturing a mastermind of terror attacks. It is not your usual Hollywood non sense CIA crime drama where an agent is a superhuman and the analysts sit back in the control room trailing the agent's footsteps and saying the guy sitting infront of him,"Kill him after the work is done". Nope. There ain't any bullshits like that. This movie will lead you through what it takes an unclaimed secret agency to carry out an operation without any external or internal help. If you think the movie is yet another chase and kill drama as in Hollywood,You Sir,are surely bored of such movies and need a fresh look at this. Akshay Kumar is brilliant is action movies. After a series of comedies from him,We had Holiday,a brilliance from Murgaddan and here we have yet another mind blowing acting from him. Anupam Kher has continued his series of grave acting from A Wednesday and Special chabbis. With Danny,you cant ask more. His naturalism oozed here. Kay Kay Menon,one of the most underrated actors in Bollywood has once again done a commendable job in the movie. With a brilliant script and direction,the movie is a classic must watch thriller. I wont give up all the details here but a preview might be enough. The movie is yet another one of those rare master class. Bollywood has taken a different route and we sincerely hope it doesn't go its old way. Take a large bucket popcorn,Order yourself a Coke, Dim the lights,Jump on your couch and take a thrill journey of a terror world through the eyes of great actors. Acting:-9/10 Direction:-8/10. (A very difficult job in Bollywood) Script:-8/10 (Yet another tough job here) Thrills:-7.5/10 Location:-7/10 (They don't mind draining bucks on that) Soundtrack:-8/10My Rating:- 8/10." 
" Finally, Bollywood did a perfect Hollywood this time.. !!!!","First of all, hats off to Neeraj Pandey for raising the standard of Bollywood. Throughout, i never felt that i was watching a bollywood movie. Its one of the epic thriller made in Bollywood. Every scene of movie is executed in an efficient manner and once again Akshay Kumar's acting won millions of hearts and also i would like to add about Anupam Kher's acting...it will remind you of Neeraj Pandey's last movie "Special 26". Here 'BABY' refers to a mission started by some agents including Akshay kumar in order to grasp some powerful terrorists and one among them was Bilal Khan (Kay Kay Menon).I would recommend this film to each and everyone as it is one of the best movies of Indian Cinema which are made against terrorists. My rating 9/10." 
" Fall little bit short to make a way to Oscar","BABY REVIEW- An epic thriller which deserves to be in Hollywood but Neeraj Pandey made it in Bollywood and raise Bollywood standard higher.i watched it with very high expectation and film completed all my expectation.last 30-35 Min's were inspired by Hollywood Oscar winner flick Argo.i am 90% satisfied with the movie and 10% disappointed because last scenes in Argo of interrogation on airport were nail-biting but Baby badly missed those scenes.performance wise Akshay Kumar proved that why he is my favorite after Srk and why he is the best for this role.if there would be an award for best actor in thriller category then he deserves it.remaining star cast were superb.Neeraj Pandey proves that he is king of thriller movies.another masterpiece after A Wednesday and Special 26.he proves why should we watch his movies with high expectations.i could have given 9 stars to the movie but as i already said climax were 10% disappointing.if Neeraj would have copied Argo climax then Baby would have been out of the world movie..so a must watch movie for all.here we have the 1st quality movie of 2015." 
" Simply put Akshay's best performance,Neeraj's best film, one of India's best thrillers = A MASTERPIECE... A film made on international standards","Ajay Singh Rajput (akshay) is a commando who works in anti-terrorist unit and he works in a team called Baby which is led by the patriotic Firoze Ali Khan (danny). At one point, Firoze tells the ministry that something has to be done to win the confidence of the minorities in India and this would prevent Pakistan from taking advantage. And then there is a hardcore terrorist Bilal Khan (kay kay menon) planning his evil methods to cause fear. How things take shape forms the rest.The director has come up with a realistic storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was taut and attention grabbing. The dialogues were well written. The script was thrilling, out of the box and the screenplay made the film very tight and racy. The background score was intense and there are no songs which is quite relieving. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was majestic. Akshay Kumar has given career best performance, somebody please give him a national award. MINDBLOWN.A true bollywood superstar.Danny Denzongpa was dazzling. Rana Daggubati was good. Taapsee Pannu was top notch, watch out for her fantastic action scene.The best among the lot was Anupam Kher, he was superb. Kay Kay Menon was apt. Madhurima Tuli was neat. Sushant Singh was entertaining.Any film that deals with patriotism is inspiring but when you start looking at a world which is hardly known to you, it gets intriguing. This is the attempt from this team and it sure was amazing, almost pathbreaking one. The first half goes around with the layering of the plot and it is filled with its share of action, drama and powerful dialogues. The interval bang was great and the second half continues the same momentum in connecting the dots, the last 40 min is heart pounding stuff its cinema at its best.This is a film which is not only good in its packaging but will leave you with a sense of respect for the brave officers.Overall Baby is India's best edge of seat thriller, its taut,gripping,fast paced,has amazing action and mindblowing performances.A MASTERPIECE in a true sense. Neeraj Pandey who is one of India's finest directors we saw his brilliance with A Wednesday, and Special 26 .But Baby is his best.Take a bow sir. The way he shot the film so beautiful at international standards, and the action is so real, simply amazing.Baby finally evokes patriotism.You will be proud to be Indian. Left me speechless.Watch one of India's finest thrillers. Its your loss if you don't... Easily one of the better film seen in awhile.5/5* or 10/10" 
" This Baby will really blow your mind with its flawless and high voltage electric performance","Yet another compact and seat binding flick from Neeraj Pandey's side accompanied with dedicated power packed and flawless performance by our action king Akshay Kumar.The pace is as per pandey's rhythm with a strong message and the climax is nail biting which will increase your heart beat and the blood pressure. Special 26 trio has again shown their magic with their awesome performance. The other supporting actors are also impressive and mind boggling. The fight scene between Tapsi and Sushant is worth a special watch and shows the level of action by Tapsi.Some scenes will tickle you while the dialogues will make you crazy. so a must watch Bollywood movie and eagerly waiting for the trio next project in future... Don't miss" 
" BABY is a daring attempt which should be lauded and appreciated","Move over commercial masala potboilers with item songs, hero smashing 10 guys with a single blow and typical song-dance routine -Neeraj Pandey's BABY will give you goosebumps with fast-paced gritting thrills and excitementAn elite covert operation group BABY learns about bomb implanted in various cities in India. They must investigate and unravel the terrorist plan before time flies killing thousand of innocent citizen.Directed by Neeraj Panday, whose previous work included A Wednesday and Special Chabbis, BABY will consume you right from the opening as Akshay Kumar gets involved into the investigation and the cat-mouse begins. From here onward there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. The scene where Akshay interrogates a suspect by stuffing him in a plastic bag is one of the best scene I have seen in recent time. The scene where Akshay Kumar's partner officer fights with another suspect before he comes for the rescue is simply mindblowing. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Dialogues are fine. It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. Other actors do justice to their roleOverall , BABY is nail-biting , reality-based action thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4.5/5" 
" One of the Finest Film of Bollywood and Akshay Kumar","Rarely you come across an Indian movie that doesn't hit a single false note. BABY is one such film. Writer-Director Neeraj Pandey has made a brilliant film that is not only technically at par with the best in the world, but it's also a dispassionate non- judgmental take on terrorism that's completely devoid of jingoism and is extremely gripping. Full marks to Producer Bhushan Kumar for believing in such a landmark film, backed by exceptional marketing especially when it's devoid of songs. BABY is one of the finest films ever made in the history of Indian cinema. Not only because of its excellent cinematic credentials but also because of the balanced 'Thought' behind the film. Neeraj Pandey once again proves that he's a genius. This time he proves, it's possible to better Perfection. We say, hey baby, don't think, just go for BABY.A Must Watch!!!!!"
