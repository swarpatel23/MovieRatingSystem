" Politics, Corruption, Skullduggery: An Entertaining Hybrid","If this were a typical Hollywood political thriller, it would be clear which folks were the nasty ones and which were the heroes. If this were a typical Bollywood film, there would be plenty of dancing and the usual generational conflicts. But Raajneeti is neither; surely it is a political thriller, but because it upends expectations, some viewers are disappointed it doesn't deliver what they expect. Granted, it might be a richer film from Westerners if they were more familiar with the complexities of politics in another country, but if you approach this film for what it is--a political thriller with a heavy dollop of family melodrama and a good deal of violence, adding numerous rich characterizations and brilliant color, you might find it hugely entertaining" 
" A multi-starer to the core","Even if you do not know before going into the movie, it is evident in the first few minutes that the film draws heavily from the epic of Mahabharata. From the basic plot to the characters. Your palms will get sweaty a few times if you can relate to it.Ranbir Kapoor is our modern day Arjun & Krishna woven into one. All characters in the movie have shades of gray and Ranbir is no exception. He is a strategist who is not afraid to go the bloody mile. Being a young actor in a multi starer can be tricky, but Ranbir does emerge on top, thereby setting the pace for more serious & deeper roles in the future. Nana Patekar is so subtle & understated that he takes the film forward effortlessly. No yelling, just shrewd smiles. Ajay Devgn proves yet again that he is past the stage where he needs screen time to justify his role. He easily enters into the skin of the modern day Karna, letting Manoj Bajpai as Duryodhan take center stage. And Bajpai, justifies every minute of his presence on screen. Arjun Rampal has his moments in the sun. Katrina impresses mainly through her improved Hindi. This is definitely not the role that she was hoping would get her a national award.Subtlety is not a mark of Prakash Jha's cinema. From Gangajal to Apaharan to Raajneeti, all are in your face dramas. Raajneeti, if I may say, would be his most commercial outing in some time. We have very mainstream actors, a grand scale in the sheer number of crowds, bloody violence, cars going up in flames & people killing each other left, right & center.Even for its 3 hour run time, some scenes & sequences do seem rushed in a bit. Nasserudin Shah has as much a presence in the film as he has on the posters. He is not in the film if you are five minutes late to the movie. All our political men are ultra virile & the females- ultra fertile. There is also a needless club song. Then, there are car bombs & a climactic gun battle that is a bit over the top just like all Prakash Jha films. It could have been kept tighter & more believable.But that said, the film is a gripping tale with very intensely executed pieces and careful attention to detail. The basic premise remains that of the Mahabharata, but the film is not limited to that. It is fast paced and there is seldom a loose moment. It is not Jha's best work, not even close. But I am tempted to rate it highly for the power packed performances & the gripping screenplay.I say 3.5 on 5" 
" A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A spineless saga of political corruption","The Hindi cinema over the years has produced a plethora of timeless gems, which not only entertained the masses, but also awed the critics with their originality, poignance, austerity and occasional grandeur. Today, the Hindi cinema has become a mere impression of what it used to be in its decorated days.Rajneeti is a mere continuation of the long chain of over hyped run-of-the- mill movies, which lack both originality and substance. The ever meticulous and uncanny Prakash Jha fails to leave any mark on the movie, which is a mere mishmash of weak dialogues, trite sub-slots, incongruities, and incompetency in editing and to some extent in direction. Jha fallibly blends the epic tale of the Mahabharata with that of the Godfather in Rajneeti. Jha missed yet another trick by failing to acknowledge and avow to the fact that Rajneeti was meant to be an adaptation of the Mahabharata.The stellar cast of the movie somehow manages to give it a much needed impetus. The acting is commendable with a special mention of Manoj Vajpayee, Nana Patekar and Arjun Rampal. The cinematography, sound editing & mixing are also up to the mark. The movie, though marred by the aforementioned inconsistencies is definitely worth a watch if the viewer overlooks the banalities of the plot and its conspicuous similarities to the Mahabharata and the Godfather trilogy.PS: Rajneeti can definitely serve to be a guilty pleasure to the less eclectic viewers and for those whose sole purpose is entertainment. 6.5/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/" 
" An Epic unfolds","Power. The quest for its supremacy has seen many a battle through centuries bringing chaos, destruction, bloodshed, grief and loss. India's greatest epic, The Mahabharat witnessed cruel forces stand for what they seemed as right, against their brothers who, aided by a master Strategist, outsmarted the great warriors. In the end, it never was about good or evil. It was about achieving victory at any cost. Prakash Jha's audacious venture of Raajneeti treads this very path to re-incarnate the intricate battle for supremacy. An ensemble cast comprising of Nana Patekar, Ajay Devgan, Manoj Bajpai, Arjun Rampal, Ranbir Kapoor, Katrina Kaif, Naseeruddin Shah and an impressive lot of others play today's warriors in the great battlefield of Indian politics. The back story of Kunti's 'first born', Karna leads us to the high stakes political game in the Pratap family after their supremo is hospitalized. The state is witnessing a transition in government and there is more than one challenger within the family itself. The battle lines have been drawn and clearly, the thirst for power has corrupted everyone involved. There is no good in this quest for victory. Aided by Karna, Duryodhan leads his charge against the Paandavs who are aided by the experienced strategist, Krishna. After the fall of Paandu, the united brothers of Yudhishtir and Arjun salvage their position with every move, lie and trick outside the book as Krishna guides them through the battlefield. This essence of The Mahabharat has been adroitly adapted to Raajneeti's political backdrop and all credit for its intricate development goes to writers Anjum Rajabali and Mr. Jha himself. The scale is elaborate, the cast ensemble and the plot engaging but the execution of it all with the thorough script, well paced screenplay, masterful direction and flawless performances make this a remarkable film. Raajneeti is not for the faint hearted who solely indulge in slap-stick comedies, heart warming tragedies, mushy love stories or any vampire chronicles. This is real, wicked, unforgiving and ruthless politics. But Jha doesn't make a documentary with this cast. There is a bit of filmy drama with women being impregnated after just one encounter, love being compromised for the ultimate goal in battle and people being used as pawns on a big chess board. At the same time, Jha is unforgiving while he portrays the brutally of battle. There are car bombs, assassins, gruesome beatings, bloodshed and profanity suited to the film's environment. It rarely fails to surprise you with every new conniving plot and strategy and the convincing performances by the actors who certainly are portraying dual characters. One being those of the film Raajneeti and the other being the celluloid reincarnations of characters from The Mahabharat. This is also a performance powerhouse. Naseeruddin Shah of course, excellent in his brief role, deserved more screen presence. Nana Patekar's simplicity in portraying the most important of characters is awe inspiring. He is indeed a mentor for the rest of them. It's been a long time since we watched Manoj Bajpai in a worthy role and what a laudable performance it was! His defining moment was his speech after Shakuni Mama's incident. Ajay Devgan being Jha's favorite man maintains his typical intensity in a solid act while Arjun Rampal delivers the most shocking performance which is also his finest yet. Watch him as he speaks to his brother on his cell phone with bloody hands and you will witness the intense actor in him. Sarah Kane in a brief role seemed quite seasoned already along with Nikhila Trikha (Kunti). Katrina Kaif has proved her worth with Raajneeti. Jha instilled confidence in Katrina's mediocre dialog delivery and nurtured her to reach her epitome in the public speech she makes in front of thousands. She now sheds the tag of the cute, beautiful new comer and surpasses many of her peers showing her versatility in just the past year. Speaking of which, the new force to be reckoned with is certainly Ranbir Kapoor. From being the lover boy, funny man, awakened man and salesman, he proves his mettle as the underdog who earns respect through actions. Whether he is playing chess on his BB or watching his game plan unfold on the screen or calming an infuriated, impulsive brother, Ranbir shows his composure and caliber while making his presence felt in the midst of accomplished senior artists. The musical score also has an ensemble cast here. With Pritam, Aadesh Shrivastava, Shantanu Moitra and Wayne Sharpe, the music is brilliant. The pop-classical Ishq Barse, the melodious Bheegi Si Bhaagi Si, the uplifting theme song - Dhan dhan Dharti by Shankar and Wayne Sharpe and Aadesh Shrivastava & Shashi's outstanding Mora Piya are all excellent, even with their well remixed versions (Mora Piya 'trance' mix!). But Jha mercilessly edits the songs from the movie, only to keep a bare minimum when the screenplay could exhale. Prakash Jha seemed to draw inspirations from The Mahabharat, 'The Godfather', 'Kalyug' as well as the 'Sarkars' and in his distinctive way, gave us an engaging, witty, hard hitting, intense drama that is a depiction of a democracy that works, but at a price. With real people, about 10,000 of them, Jha shot in locales that serve as the battlefield with superb cinematography by Sachin Krishn. His well researched and gripping script is the soul of this multi-starrer and his vision to bring the greatest epic to life just adds to the viewer's intrigue and awe element. One might even need repeated viewings in order to grasp some deeper dialogs. Minor dramatizations apart, Jha's work is commendable simply because very few have succeeded with the scale and grandeur of Raajneeti and while critics can dissect all they want, this IS the most definitive and convincing version of The Mahabharat and the ugly face of democracy.8.889 on a scale of 1-10." 
" This time Jha doesn't quite get it right.","This one could have been an epic, but instead it is another Bollywood potboiler which fails to break any new ground. Coming from Prakash Jha whose body of work is legendary to say the least, this comes close to being a disappointment.PERFORMANCEWISE- one has little to complain about, as each actor has tried to give the best to their characterizations. Ranbir Kapoor once again proves he is a star in the making. his restrained but measured performance as the calculative mastermind is awesome! It is probably the best in the movie. Manoj Bajpai and Ajay Devgan excel in their respective roles. Nana as the SHRI KRISHNA(his character is in fact called Brij Gopal!) in this Mahabharat lends a controlled dignity to his character. Katrina seems to be getting better with each movie, here too she gives a commendable performance. Arjun Rampal ,charismatic though he is, does not quite get into the skin of the character or maybe it was not well written! (I would really like to see him in more good movies).DIRECTION-WISE- taut direction from Jha. Not quite as gripping as Gangajal but much better than Apaharan. The sheer number of people Jha brings into his canvas at the rallies and speeches is awe inspiring!! gives a lot of authenticity to the whole drama.The script lets him down towards the end, and it actually becomes a waste of potentially explosive ingredients.PLOTWISE- well by now everybody who had any interest in this movie knows that it is a take on the Mahabharata with bits of the Godfather thrown in! True but not entirely! For the story may have a lot of resemblance to both but impact-wise doesn't come anywhere close to either! In fact sometimes the script seems to be very illogical, what with women getting pregnant as and when the script demanded! the plot was too derivative... maybe it would have made an impact if this movie was made as a crime thriller rather than a political one!! No one can relate to such improbable depictions like political assassinations as shown in the movie which were carried out by the high profile political leaders themselves( the climax shootout!!?I guess Ranbir's character learnt how to shoot a gun while in the U.K. getting his Ph.D!!) The writing is not at all shoddy, it is even brilliant at places, but some mediocre plot twists give the movie a front gallery crowd pleasing feel, particularly the climax!!And I don't think this movie addressed any political issue nor did it show any reference to any actual events it mirrored.SO to say the topicality of the movie is not relevant to our country in anyway... it is rather a depiction of personal vendetta!! So I think they should not have taken the liberty of using Vande Mataram as the theme music at the climactic speech by Katrina(à la Mrs Sonia Gandhi??)Give us a break!.4 stars from one each for the four stellar performances and two for the overall effort!! I would rate it 6/10******TECHNICAL FLAWS IN THE SCRIPT- being a doctor myself, i couldn't help but laugh at some very goofy mistakes- the CPR resuscitation scene at the Hospital ICU is so wrong,the chest compressions ,the defibrillator placement everything was so inaccurate. They even stop it at one point for the convenience of taking Nana's and the patient's close-up shot!The doctor replies to the press' query as to whether the person in question is paralysed after an episode of heart attack, by saying they're waiting for his ECG report!!! well an ECG is the first thing you do in a case of heart attack and not wait for its report overnight!! moreover it is done for seeing the heart's condition and not the brain!!(paralysis is much more common in stroke which is not heart attack BTW maybe they got confused between a heart attack and a stroke!!) they could have consulted a doctor!! unforgivable for an A-list director" 
" Prakash Jha's attempt at Polymorphism!","First of all let me clear it out, I personally hate politics and am a novice in it but after watching this movie I concluded few things: 1) All politicians are murderers.2) People switch their present or future life partners with others in order to gain votes or money to gain votes. 3) Police is just like dice for politicians. They throw and spin them against each other for their own benefits.4) There is no term like family or sibling in politics. Anyone can turn against anyone or may be kill each other just for greed of votes.5) Public is a complete moron; people vote for that person who gives them a cunning speech and not to that person who genuinely wants good for them.6) There are no human beings in politics, just a bunch of 'escaped-from-hell' devils fighting against each other to attain powers not for using for benefit of public but for personal greediness.I am not sure whether the things I concluded are correct but you will sense trueness in them once you watch this movie. Prakash Jha( Mrityudand, GangaJal and Apaharan), famous for making movies on serious topics and getting success for every film, fails this time. All his previous movies worked because he stuck to the main story till the end and the lead actor did justice with his role. But, in Raajneeti he did a different thing, he assembled a huge star cast with every actor having a potential of pulling of any movie well and a strong topic: politics, which was great but he didn't give preference to MAIN story this time which went wrong.Raajneeti is supposedly based on the epic Mahabharata in which brothers went for a long brutal war against each other because of their personal differences. Thus, with so many characters in the movie it was impossible for any director to present two stories simultaneously: Politics and a family war. Prakash Jha had so much scope of showing the inside story of the dirty politics going on in the country, people would have been satisfied with that but we all know there very few politicians who come from the same family or may be there is no one. So, instead of showing the movie on politics Prakash Jha ended up making a movie in which a group of brothers play conspiracies against each other to become the group leader.I am not indicating that Raajneeti was a complete failure. It made huge impacts many times. The positives were fine performances by the actors. Ranbir Kapoor, Manoj Bajpai, Katrina Kaif and Arjun Rampal deserve special accolades for their performances. Naseeruddin Shah had nothing to do in the movie. Ajay Devgn too had little scope in comparison to others but he did his job well. Nana Patekar was OK. Sarah Thomson was good.As I told storyline would have been much better if Prakash Jha and Anjum Rajabali stuck only to the politics. Music by Wayne Sharpe went unnoticed except for the song Mora Piya which was played a few times in the background. Editing was poor, the movie could easily have been cut short by thirty minutes which didn't happen the movie so gave the audiences many chances of yawning and checking their watches.To conclude I would say the difference lies in Prakash Jha's earlier successful movies and Raajneeti is that the previous movies were made with an intention of presenting the audiences with reality and Raajneeti was only made with intention of scoring big at the box office. The film had so many brilliant actors that Prakash Jha didn't do full justice with everyone, he wanted to include everything in his movie: romance, suspense, and some scenes which were completely unexpected and unwanted.I know you will watch this film, so there is no point of saying anything on this but yeah this film has its moments which will remind you of old Prakash Jha. That's why I say he didn't go for politics, he went for polymorphism! My Rating: 6/10Thanks & Regards" 
" epic Mahabharata meets godfather.","I watched this movie last night. it was not planned but somehow i just went as some of my friends are big Prakash Jha fan. the movie started with some promise and it looked OK to me and my friends were more than happy the way it turned out. BUT i had my fears as it was turning out to be pretty much like godfather and the moment ranbir kapoor is slapped by the policemen that was the moment i was completely put off - HOW many times we see the same things. it was with sarkar too. abhisek bachchan in sarkar and ranbir kappor in rajneeti is all the same to me - trying to do a Al pacino. If that was not enough they brought in complete Mahabharata which was still good.over all the movie is good, better than other releases but what was the point of bringing in Mahabharata and godfather in it. it could have been lot better in its own way but it didn't." 
" Good Hindi cinema is back!","Welcome back to the world of Hindi cinema, where movies have a huge star cast, are 3 hour longs and actually have a good story line. Raajneeti is a good mix of modern-day Mahabharata and The Godfather, which turns out to be a pretty deadly combination. Its about a political family which has just lost its leader in the midst of the upcoming election. This in turn sets his family at war as the leader chooses his brother and his son Prithviraj Pratap(Arjun Rampal) as his heirs, rather than his own son Veerendra Pratap(Manoj Bajpai). This angers Veerendra Pratap and he decides to take matter into his own hand. To help him out in this scenario is the Dalit leader form the village Sooraj Kumar(Ajay Devgn). So begins the saga of murder, vengeance and the want to gain political power by any means. In this process gets stuck Samar Pratap(Ranbir Kapoor) who had just come for a leisurely visit to India from New York to attend his uncles birthday. Turning down a teaching job in New York he instead stays back in India to help out is family. In him we see shades of Michael Corleone as a young leader who at first was hesitant to join the dirty family business but reluctantly has become a major part of it, and has started taking all the major decisions. There's also the lovely and innocent India Pratap(Katrina Kaif), his childhood friend who gradually begins to see what kind of a person Samar has become. And to help Samar there's Brij Gopal(Nana Patekar), his mother's brother. He is the all wise, all knowing Mama who can be sweet and mean all at the same time.This film in the beginning can get a little confusing to its viewers as there are way too many characters who are introduced, and who actually play an important part throughout the film. But as the movie progress the confusion diminishes and you start seeing the clear picture and you probably start taking sides. There is no pure good or evil here, everything's in a shade of Grey, like they all believe that the means justify the end. You take Ajay Devgn who is a local village fellow, a Dalit leader, in the beginning he seems all nice and right, but politics as we know it is not a nice guys game, at least in India. Ranbir turns from the innocent American student to a smart schemer who'll do anything to protect his brother. He even fakes it with his American girlfriend Sara(Sarah Jean Collins) when she decides to give him a surprise visit to India. Be it true or not but this movie shows you a pretty interesting insight of politics in India. Its a brother kill brother world out there.Acting wise everyone has done a good job I must say but special credit goes to Ranbir Kapoor who has shown that he can actually act in films other than romantic comedies in which he plays a chocolate boy lover trying to woo a girl standing in the balcony. Nana Patekar is not his usual self hurling abuses and shouting dialogues at the top of his voice, he is a smiling, silent planner who is very subtle throughout the film and acts only when necessary. Ajay Devgn is also in the background throughout the film, which is very unlike Prakash Jha as we have seen in his previous films like Apharan and Gangajal. But it is nicely done on his part. Katrina Kaif has probably taken acting lessons and is very sober in this film, and looks amazing as always. Arjun Rampal in my opinion has 'acted' for the very first time and by the end of the movie you feel satisfied that he didn't ruin it by his dead, expressionless face. Manoj Bajpai has a typical role, so no surprises there.Go watch this movie if you want to see a wholesome Hindi film with substance. Its got your abuses, gruesome action scenes, a couple of lovemaking scenes put in here and there, a few songs in the background, nasty cops, hot Indian summer, everything that you need to enjoy your 3 hours in an air conditioned theatre! 7/10" 
" A Must Watch!","Mahabharat returns in Prakash Jha's 'Raajneeti'. This one is a Masterstroke! Jha makes a film about politics, it's players and it's history.What works the most for 'Raajneeti' is it's inspiration. Jha and Anjum Rajabali's screenplay is water-tight, the first hour, especially, is fantastic. It's a winner, because it's a drama that creates an impact of it's own. Jha's direction is superb, and performances are award-worthy. Despite, a running time of over 2 Hours and 30 Minutes, this film is a must watch! Jha and Rajabali's screenplay is water-tight, Jha's direction is superb. The Performances: Manoj Bajpayee is fantastic. He is sure to take away all the awards in the Supporting Actor category next year. Nana Patekar is, as always, flawless. Ranbir Kapoor is wonderfully restrained. Ajay is good, but he deserved more scope. Arjun Rampal is superb. Naseeruddin Shah in a cameo, is effective. Katrina speaks Hindi, and does a fair job. Nikhila Trikha is excellent. Shruti Seth is good. Others are perfect. The Camera-Work is killer.'Raajneeti' is not to be missed. 2010 brings it's first power-packed venture! Two Thumbs Up!" 
" Better than average, but no cigar","Wife recommended this film, so I watched. Overall, a better than average flick, but no cigar. The first part of the film is definitely the meatiest part of this film, where it starts as a modern day allegory of the Mahabharata embroiled in Indian politics--very fascinating. However, where it descends to trash is the second part, when scenes are ripped off scenes from "Godfather" and "Hard Boiled", and the story climaxes into an abysmal heap of dung. Worse yet, there is some pretty nice acting from all the actors involved, including non-actress Katrina Kaif. To aspiring Indian film makers, the first half of this film is how to improve Bollywood." 
" I might be the odd one ... but i didn't like this flick","When someone buys a ticket to watch a movie starring Nana Patekar, Ajay Devgan and Naseruddin Shah, they expect a high voltage movie. This stars have the charisma to spread fire on the screen. But what a wastage ??? Naser was just in the movie to give a speech and birth to a un-wanted child ( what this character eats ... though he is old, he succeeded in just one time).What they did with Nana Patekar? He just sit around, doing nothing. Sometimes he give advice to Ranbir. And yes, once he inspires Ranbir to shoot Ajay in a Krishna fashion. Ranbir can kill a unarmed man driving car using mobile-bomb(don't know what actually it called), but not Ajay. why? Truly need a explanation? Ajay Devgan ... though in first half he has something to do and say, in second half he just wonder around, like a PA of Manoj Bajpai. Ajay can easily kill Ranbir's father and refuse any relationship with Ranbir's Mother, then what happened to him? Why he didn't take the clear shot at Ranbir? And, When he knows that Manoj is in danger, then why does not he call others for help? As the movie showed, Ranbir's father accidentally went to airport with Ranbir and he is there just for some minutes. Lets assume it takes him two hours. In just two hours how Ajay and Manoj plan such a good trap and kill him? Why Ajay and Manoj always try to kill people going to the airport? It feels like a typical Hindi movie with no character development, no good story, there was neither any twist nor any surprises to audience. It has a love triangle and an unwanted child who fight against his mother(by-birth).What new to this movie? It shows fight between political leaders. But I wish they come up with a griping and interesting story." 
" Rs.65 crores on this.I"m not joking.","Prakash Jha Productions, Walkwater Media Ltd. and UTV Motion Pictures' Raajneeti (UA) is a political thriller. Bhanupratap Singh (Khan Jehangir Khan) and his younger brother, Chandraprakash Singh (Chetan Pandit), head the Rashtravadi Party which had been in power earlier and which now supports the government. It is trying to come back to power. The drama details the games politicians play at the time of elections.The film has an interesting plot (Prakash Jha). The screenplay, penned jointly by Anjum Rajab Ali and Prakash Jha, is interesting in the first half but deteriorates after interval when the political game gets ugly and people are eliminated one after another. On the plus side of the script is the fact that it is well-researched and gives the viewer a deep insight into what goes on in the name of politics. Some twists and turns are shocking and leave the audience dumbfounded.But the film is not without its share of flaws and lows. For one, it is too long and since it moves on a single track, it becomes boring and monotonous, especially after interval. Almost all the lead characters in the film are negative and could stoop to any level to gain political mileage. This creates confusion in the minds of the viewers as they don't have a single person whose finger they can hold through the film. In that sense, there is no hero for the audience to consider as their role model. The excessive violence in the second half can act as a deterrent for the female audience who may cringe at the sight of so much bloodshed. Yet another weak point is the use of high-flown Hindi in the dialogues, making it difficult for the viewer, especially the city-based youngsters, to understand the goings-on easily. Besides, there are so many characters in the film that it takes longer than usual for the audience to understand how the various characters are related to one another.Frankly, the drama appeals till the interval point with the killing of Chandraprakash Singh being the most exciting part. Post-interval, there are some exciting parts but the film tends to get monotonous and repetitive what with people killing people at the drop of a hat. Fans of Ranbir Kapoor, Katrina Kaif, AjayDevgan, Nana Patekar and NaseeruddinShah may not take too kindly to their characterisations/roles: Ranbir Kapoor, unlike his earlier films, is no fun-loving cool dude; rather, he plays a serious role; Katrina Kaif loves Ranbir but there is no romance between them; Ajay Devgan's Suraj character is present throughout the film but he doesn't have a role that can be called very substantive or one that makes him a hero; Nana Patekar doesn't have fiery dialogues to mouth, something he has become synonymous with; Naseeruddin Shah has such a minuscule role that his fans will feel cheated. The film lacks emotions and light moments. The ending is depressing.Coming to the performances, the actors have all done very well. Ranbir Kapoor is effective in a serious role. Katrina Kaif does her part well; she leaves a mark in the non-glamorous role too. Arjun Rampal springs a surprise with a promising show. Ajay Devgan underplays suitably but he doesn't have a single scene which could win him applause. Nana Patekar is efficient in a role that is more subdued than one is used to watching him in. Manoj Bajpayee has his moments. He plays his character with finesse, Naseeruddin Shah is excellent but he hardly gets any scope. Sarah Thompson leaves a mark as Sarah. Shruti Seth does a wonderful job. Kiran Karmarkar is superb in the role of police officer Sharma. Vinay Apte is extremely natural. Nikhila Tirkha is okay as Ranbir and Arjun Rampal's mother.Chetan Pandit is wonderfully restrained. Khan Jehangir Khan acts ably. Dayashankar Pandey is superbly natural. Darshan Jariwala and Ravi Khemu provide able support. Barkha Bisht is alright in an item song-dance.Prakash Jha's direction is good but the narration would appeal more to the audience in the Hindi-speaking belt and the older generation than the youth. Also, by almost neglecting light moments, heart-rending emotions and romance, he has restricted the film's appeal. Music is good but the songs in the film are not complete, having been edited. The audience's enjoyment of the music ('Mora piya' song composed by Aadesh Shrivastava) is, therefore, greatly reduced. Action scenes (Sham Kaushal) are wonderfully composed. The scene of the killing of Chandraprakash Singh and the bomb blast sequence in which two lead characters are killed together deserve special mention. Crowd scenes are handled excellently and there are plenty of them. But here, it must be added that the crowd scenes sometimes look monotonous because there are so many of them. Camera-work (Sachin Kumar Krishnan) is superb. Sets (Jayant Deshmukh) are very nice. Editing (Santosh Mandal) is crisp.On the whole, Raajneeti suffers on account of a dull, boring and overly lengthy second half. Considering its very fine start, it should do reasonably good business in India but since its business in the Overseas circuit will not be good enough, it may be a problem for its worldwide distributor (UTV) to recover its investment of over Rs. 65 crore." 
" Mahabharatha meets Godfather !!!","Came after watching Prakash Jha's latest offering "Raajneeti" starring Ranbir Kapoor, Katrina Kaif, Arjun Rampal and Ajay Devgan in the lead... While watching this movie you will get a feeling that the whole plot and characters are heavily inspired from the epic story Mahabharatham and the classic "The Godfather"..."Raajneeti" is basically a complex game of politics where human relationships are challenged to achieve the ultimate power...Story rolls on with a flashback where, Bhaskar played by Naseruddin Shah, an old leftist, challenging the most powerful leaders together with the support of a young lady who considers him as God.. But destiny changes their fortunes when she gets impregnated due to Bhaskar and gives birth to the child, but even before see her child's face, Brij Gopal played by Nana Patekar abandons the child...Rolling to present era. Sooraj Kumar (played by Ajay Devgan) is the guy whom the people of Azad Nagar considers as the leader of Dalits... In parallel, story of a family with huge political background develops with the clashes between Prithviraj (played by Arjun Rampal) and Veerendra (played by Manoj Bajpayee) for the political throne, after Prithviraj's father is shot dead... Samar (played by Ranbir Kapoor) comes in as a help for his brother and Sooraj joins with Veerendra... Rest of the story deals with who gets to the throne finally, where Indu (played by Katrina Kaif) also gets trapped in this war...One can clearly say that, the characterization of Sooraj was definitely etched out from one of the greatest epic character "Karna" from Mahabharatha and that of Katrina Kaif was from the life of Sonia Gandhi.. The makers have deliberately tried to create a replica of personality of Sonia Gandhi in Katrina Kaif !! Manoj Bajpayee can be seen as Duryaodhana... And many incident/situations resembles both Mahabharatha and Godfather....Even though the whole proceedings were looking predictable, Prakash Jha has done a commendable job in keeping us engaged most of the time... And hats off to him for the effort he has put in to make this film... Coming to performances, everybody justice to their parts...Ranbir Kapoor is maturing with each film.. He was utmost convincing as Samar... No incertitudes on him becoming the next superstar of Bollywood !! Arjun Rampal pitches in yet another power-packed performance... Ajay Devgan was good... Katrina Kaif takes a break from her glam-doll image here and it pays off.. Her transformations were very well enacted.... Another actor who steals the show is Nana Patekar with his impeccable timing and dialogue delivery... Manoj Bajpayee as the antagonist was superb.... And the support cast also does a fine job...Cinematography was pretty good... BG score was just OK...On the downside, the pacing of the second half gets slowed down, at times.... BG score could have been better... Duration of the film should have been taken care of by some trimming...On the whole, watch Raajneeti for the sincerity with which Prakash Jha has made this film and also for the excellent performances put up from Ranbir, Arjun, Ajay, Katrina and Nana Patekar...Verdict : Contemporary Mahabharatha.. Good..Rating : 7.5/10" 
" It never ends. I prayed for death. Not worth anyones time.","This movie was horrendous. It was long and bad. The directing was bad: BEcause he never gave you time to care about any of the characters. IT was so long and boring. Because you didn't care about anyone it didn't matter that almost all of them die! It was so incredibly hard to follow too. Too much happens and the director doesn't try to focus or direct.Everyone is evil in this movie except for the one guy sooraj and what does he get? Bullet from his brother.I swear if the movie was about sooraj instead of the rest of these idiots it would have been a better movie. In fact from the way the movie starts it looks like its gonna be a sooraj (the director took so much time developing this character and his back story) movie but then something happens and we don't see him for almost an hour. The big reveal where he meets his mom is killed by the fact that u no longer care what happens cause he wasn't in the movie til it was basically over.I never write reviews of a movie but people need to know." 
" "could have been a good movie but had so many flaws"","I didn't have high expectations from the movie, even then it failed to impress me. There were a lot of things happening very fast, seemed like it was over-packed with events and turns but surprise element was missing. Dialogues were average and seemed stupid in many scenes, like the conversation between Ajay Devgan and Ranbeer's mother, and the conversation between Katrina and Ranbeer in one of the last scenes where she announces her pregnancy.Arjun Rampal was looking out of place, and wasn't carrying the aggression and rawness required for his character, he was too polished. Ranbir Kapoor acted good and carried the Micheal Corleone act well. Not to mention he had a lot of scope as his character was central, but again this was one of the flaws because it left very little for the rivalry between him and Ajay Devgan, who still made his presence felt in all the scenes and did justice to his role. Manoj Bajpei was also good but lacked sharpness needed for his character, if his character could just carried the confidence he showed up in Veer Zara. To summarize mostly all the characters were under developed. Katrina's transformation into a loving wife was so sudden that it looked awkward.Katrina as a political leader waiving hands looked awkward because of the way the scenes were shot. Dialogues and character development is the basic flaw along with not so good editing, or the movie could have been very good.That scene of Arjun Rampal after killing the police officer was executed well and had the necessary terror element, however there was so much of blood bath in the movie that it came and went like an ordinary scene.Nana Patekar was OK in his role.I would rate 6 out of 10." 
" Legacy of Prakash Jha is ruined","Let me start with the principal flaws of the film. 1. Ranbir Kapoor: Mr Kapoor's good fortune of being able to work with such an exceptional director, a host of experienced and immensely talented actors, bears a striking and a tragic resemblance to one of the main themes of the movie where political leaders get chosen just because of their lineage. Mr Kapoor is miscast, terribly inept to handle a role which requires not just depth but a personal conviction and solemnity, somebody needs to tell him that just by keeping a pensive face and faking seriousness, one cannot discharge the duties to a character whose features and intricacies can give the best scriptwriters in the world their biggest challenge. It is incomprehensible to me that a director of Mr. Jha's status would even consider such a recessive and callous actor for a role which simply put is too 'big' for him. 2. Katrina Kaif: It is a well known fact that actresses in Bollywood do not require acting skills but Ms Kaif's character has some real acting to do, at least the writer would have envisioned it so. One cannot begin to illustrate how bad she really is and how bad is it going to get in the future. I do not even want to begin on that horrifying accent. 3. Arjun Rampal: Mr. Rampal should really consider going back to his previous profession, but he would not. His crass handling of the character with hints of western accent mixed with his feeble attempts of sticking to his character's intended accent make a vicious mixture that not only poisons the fluidity of an otherwise simple film. Without mincing any words, it has to be put forward that Mr. Rampal is a very bad actor. 4. Shoddy direction and screenplay: This one was a first for a Prakash Jha film, who not so long ago made an impeccable film called 'Gangajal' with a great collaborator and actor, Mr Ajay Devgan. The script is so loose at times that it leads to frustration and irritation, something that you just don't expect from a Prakash Jha movie. The predictability of the plot was another drawback. The direction was full of complacence and perfunctoriness. The list of things that are wrong with this movie is long and one would not want to waste a lot of time enumerating them. Positive Points: 1. Veterans: Mr Patekar, Mr Bajpai and Mr Devgan don't just stand out but they carry the movie which at places seems so light because of extremely vacuous performances of Mr Kapoor and Ms Kaif, and lend the movie a vestige of validity that it certainly deserves. Especially in the case of Mr Patekar who plays the cagey,quiet and hyper intelligent strategist on Mr Kapoor's side. Some of the scenes and dialogues have been so deftly handled that one can only marvel at the fact that this movie provides the zenith and the nadir of acting skills repeatedly in two hours and forty odd minutes. 2. Few plot sequences which really bring out the connivance that really lurks behind every move in politics."
