" Wasted film, but no talent wasted (cause there was none)","What's happening in Bollywood lately? This was horrific drivel, pulling out every low card (slow motion showers, over lengthy sex-scenes) to keep men in the theater. Beyond any other Mumbai flick I have seen lately, this one proves that the only qualification for funding is an "all white skinned" cast (except for servants). The rest of the country probably keeps wondering where do they find them all in a brown skinned nation? Gul, a wannabe clothing designer, arrives in Mumbai to fulfill her dreams of success, and has no problem using anyone and everyone to scale whatever heights she can get to. Good plot, no substance. Poor acting, shallow character development, awful songs, poorly developed storyline, zero realism. Makes it difficult to endure to the end. One or two actual well known names that probably don't list this one on their resumes." 
" Better emotional drama.","Recently,i saw this movie at theater and i found it pretty emotional drama.What is the storyline of the movie is that Gul(Udita Goswami)is a girl who goes to Mumbai to achieve success and while leaving her mother gives her a diary to record her day to day activities and a note.During her Journey for success in a Fashion house,she uses people stairs to reach to the peak of success.she also takes her mother's diary and note as a joke.Soon she realizes that she has hurted feelings of people and wants to correct those mistakes and begins to take interest in her mother's diary and note.But soon she realizes the truth of Mumbai and corporate world,and wants to remain what she is know.Udita Gosawmi with a new look was good to watch.Songs were good and i think it is a good movie to watch for womens rather than for mens.My vote for this movie is 5/10." 
" Liked it.","Maybe not the best of acting, but liked the movie plot overall and fact that it was less than 2 hours and the characters were believable.
It also had dark humor element with some hilarious lines.Honestly, One of more watchable hindi movies I ran into lately."
