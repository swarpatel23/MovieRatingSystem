" Wonderful, entertaining classical movie of the 1990's","Dilwale (1994) is a romantic, action-packed entertainer of the 1990's decade. Ajay Devgan for the first time in his acting career, then, did a mentally retarded person's role and his change of image really worked wonders. Not only was Devgan appreciated widely by both, critics and masses, but this movie, DILWALE(1994) did very well, then at the box-office. Also, Ajay's female co-star in this movie, Raveena Tandon,not only looked super-pretty in this movie but also danced well in the song numbers, too. Paresh Rawal, Avtar Gill and Gullu(Gulshan Grover)too have acted well in this triangular love story.I was disappointed though, that the song number," Jo tumhe chaahe usko satana", picturised on Raveena Tandon and Sunil Shetty , was chopped off the editing table.The songs of this movie were outstanding too.This movie, Dilwale(1994), was in reality, Raveena Tandon's first career super-hit. The best part of this movie, was though Sunil Shetty's under-rated acting as a police officer. Sunil was even nominated in all the many dozen film awards functions, then for "Best supporting Actor award" category.The songs of this movie were not just a rage, then, but even now many Bollywood fans, go online on the internet to hear this movie's super-melodious songs. I have already, watched this movie 5 times till date." 
" Believe it or not I have seen this movie more than 50 times","This is one of the movies which is very popular in Afghanistan. I am not sure if Indian people remember this movie or not but Afghans certainly do. I still hear some of the guys on Afghan local radios asking for this song to be broadcasted for them. The actors were chosen very well. I liked both Ajay Devgan and Sunil Shetty in the movie. I did not like Raveena in the movie.Music: This film's music had great impact on it's audience forcing them to watch the movie for the great songs from NADEEM SHRAVAN. Also the singers, Kumar Sanu, Alka, Udit has done great job singing songs for this movie.I recommend anyone watching this movie, specially music lovers." 
" A long journey of action, drama and music","Dilwale is a good film, except for the similar flaws that most films of the 90's had.Story is about an efficient cop who is give the task of handling a mentally deranged man's case. The cop soon realizes that the convict is innocent and does all that he can to prove the latter's innocence and bring the culprits to book.The music is noteworthy, with Kumar Sanu's melodious voice in most tracks. There are many a song in this film. Some action sequences are good, bit of overacting on Sunil Shetty's part, but otherwise he and Ajay Devgn are cool. They did make a good pair in this film.The flaw - Some scenes are meaningless, at some places the editing is not smooth, and some sequences are simply exaggerated. Also some of the songs make the film unnecessarily lengthy.Watch it but watch the time!" 
" Decent romantic film","Ajay Devgan who started off with Phool Aur Kaante did several action films, After the success of PAK and Jigar rest films bombed in 1993 Dilwale however was a superhit. The film is a typical romantic story of 90s with twists in the form of Ajay's mental illness,not that it's novel but yet a decent film. The film starts with Sunil Shetty in a typical 90s style action scene and then goes into flashback of Ajay Devgan, his scene in the mental assylm is superb, though it reminds us of Ittefaq(1969) starring Rajesh Khanna. THe scenes involving Ajay and Sunil are well handled, the film does have some corny scenes like some comic scenes, Also the romantic track is typical 90s, with many songs and also we have the typical villains but for a 90s film it's superbDirection by Harry Baweja is good Music by Nadeem Shravan became a hit, Kumar Sanu's solo Kitna Haseena Chehra is superb, Saaton Janam(in 2 versions)is superb, while Udit's Mauka Milega too is superb, rest all are good tooAjay Devgn was slowly learning the craft of acting, he does a good job in this film, especially in the mental scenes. Sunil Shetty is sincere in his supporting act, however his voice and dialogue delivery were very bad those days, especially in high pitched scenes Raveena is okay in her part, Paresh Rawal and Pramod Moutho are good in their villainy,Rami Reddy has no dialogue only keeps staring. Reema Lagoo is as usual, Saeed Jaffrey is as usual Gulshan Grover plays A Bihari babu who keeps trying for Raveena and provides some funny moments." 
" Average Music with Timeless Music","When this movie originally came in 92, even as a child I remember its songs being played at every corner, such was the success of the music. Even the songs in the audio cassettes included prologues in form of small conversations. The movie was just another love story. The acting too was plain average except for Preash Rawal's Mama Thakur character. Watch him playing a bad guy to the hilt before joined the buffoonery bandwagon. Raveena Tandon was really one of the hottest girls of that time. Just watch her dancing in the songs. I bet running around trees could not have been much merrier. And yeah, if you don't believe that Sunil Shetty can't look good(forgive me, tolerable) watch him in this one, he definitely was not bad-looking(could not use good looking for obvious reasons). Overall, a watchable flick." 
" What a Intense acting by Ajay Devgn & Sunil Shetty","Outstanding performance by Ajay Devgn..
Nobody can perform like Ajay Devgn
In this type of intense rol."
