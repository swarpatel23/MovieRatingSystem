" A New Generation ; a new style of movies","The movie was different from any we have seen before. the only probable copy of friends was when maya wins the game of cards but there was nothing else about friends that was similar. the movie though had fresh faces in it the actors tried and did their level best to make the movie what it is. The story is about people that meet each other from different walks of life. The trials troubles that they face with careers, with getting people to accept them, with their relationships etc. which is some what similar to most people in India. the idea of friends with benefits hasn't been that prevalent in India but it is catching on and people are getting used to it.i loved the concept of the movie. i loved the fact that it dealt with the place i love the most mumbai and how people survive. nervous breakdown, career choices etc and i think it was a very novel idea.********** stars to the movie." 
" Just Pathetic !!!!!!!!!","This is just an awful and pedantic put parody of 'FRIENDS' , have seen in years. I had attended Vir Das's stand up once , where he was sure of a good stage career , but his big screen and silver screen image is just bland with jokes that really don't get you anywhere. His big screen debut was no better . May be he should stick to his career as a touring stand up as his show on CNBC isn't getting him anywhere. The world's number one Condiment 'Salsa' proved to be a bland affair with lack of characterization and skimpy modeling . I don't say the movie concept was bad but , they could have maybe let the idea of 'Free friendship' grow to its essence among the majority of the Indian public. OK , where does this review leave the actresses and actors .Well , they show tremendous promise but have to work a lot on their skills and natural deliveries .I have no doubt in mind that they could be some day very good actors." 
" A Must Watch!","Yet another sparkler from the very acclaimed writer of Page 3, Apaharan & corporate, Manoj Tyagi. Mumbai Salsa his directorial debut is a master class with much believable characters of the today's Metro generation. With beautifully sketched screenplay and sound direction the film takes you away and moves you to the core. The movie shows the pulse of Mumbai in the day to day life of the several characters who meet at a common place and introspect their life. What touched me in this movie is that I related to couple of characters. The Movie takes you to the current and changing life style of India through the individual life of the amazing characters. It is not just Mumbai that is changing, Its the whole urban India which is going through it and Manoj Tyagi captured it brilliantly. Its a feel good movie which leaves you satisfied about the times we live in. Its a MUST WATCH...P.S Get a date and Popcorn :)" 
" Pathetic awful terrible","The acting just sucks. The idea is new for Indian cinema. but the direction, script and pretty much all else falls flat on its face. 2 hours wasted ! This movie is too far-fetched, and even in modern Indian society, sex is not this free ! It just does not fit reality in nay way whatsoever. Also the characters are very shallow. there is no character development. The whole movie seems to be a series of sex romps. Not funny, nor interesting, it is 2 hours of brain dead nonsense. The worst is the acting which just is not up to the mark. Also the pronunciation of the English words is very sloppy. And the actor/actresses are not very good looking too."
