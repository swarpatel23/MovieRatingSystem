" Much Better than RAAZ 2","Okay if u are a fan of horror and have seen the both Raaz movies, you will enjoy this one. The only problem I saw was that they used a lot of graphics and they were really cheesy. But the sounds effects were really good and the places were really spooky looking. The concept was nice but it wasn't at the level of the first RAAZ. In fact a lot of scenarios were taken from the the first RAAZ. If only they had better CGI technology, this would've easily become more scarier than the first RAAZ.Aditya Narayan was quite decent being it's his first movie, he didn't overdo his acting anywhere. And offcourse Rahul Dev was just as good as he usually is. It was interesting to see him not playing a negative role for once.Overall if u have time to waste, and ur alone and in a mood for something in horror, this will get u where u need to go!" 
" Very entertaining B movie","Shaapit was my first horror movie seen in a theater. and believe me, it justified the price paid for the ticket. Most of the theater was empty which added to the atmosphere. It may not be the best Vikram Bhatt horror flick but still has some good jump scares. I consider Vikram's Raaz as one of the best bollywood horror films.the positives: spooky atmosphere, great story setting and build-up, a good mix of science, mythology and history, melodious music, some scary effects & BGM considering it was a low-budget filmthe negatives: the cast was new except Rahul Dev so acting was a bit hit-n-miss, Aditya Narayan looked a little childish for the the part of hero but his efforts are worth appreciating, the CGI effects on ghost's design were cheesyOn the whole, a very entertaining fare from Bollywood horror veteran Vikram Bhatt" 
" good movie","I just watched this movie and I liked it. This movie is completely Indian one. Horror quotient is great. The story is quite good. But I think there should be more clarification given about the connection between the curse and the ghost. They successfully created a spooky environment in this movie which I think very new to Hindi movies. I liked the professor concept also. They successfully make this character believable also. And they made a good balance between the love and horror. The direction, editing, sound and camera is great. I jumped a lot times in my chair during this movie.Now what I don't liked: 1. design of the Ghost. They should have worked more on that.2. The song ( I think we can call that item song ) sung before the prince, totally ruined the environment of the movie.3. The last destruction scene of ghost. That was too childish." 
" Watchable","Shaapit is worth a watch.The good- Great songs, Good concept, good acting,especially by Rahul Dev,no vulgarity, quite a few thrills.The bad-1 item song( something which should never be used in horror movies as it can spoil the essence of that genre), some silly scenes, amateurish acting on the part of some of the cast.But like Phoonk 2 it should be watched ideally on the big screen else you may not appreciate the effect.Surprising this was a flop. Donno what people expect. However it's much better than olden day horrors,that's for sure." 
" Gr8 Movie.","Awesome Movie. Gr8 Horror Effects. That too with sound. Best Bollywood Horror movie. Great Acting.Movie starts with love and romance an leads to how romance wins over curse. The way the ghost is characterized is awesome. And the timing of its appearance is unpredictable and awesome. Sound effect and background music is awesome. After Bhoot and Raaz this is the one the finest horror move produced in movie. Awesome Movie. Gr8 Horror Effects. That too with sound. Best Bollywood Horror movie.

" Average....","Vikram Bhatt is a terrific storyteller. Right from 'Gunegaar' to his last film '1920', his work has made me a fan of his, so watching 'Shaapit' was a must.The story of a girl who is trapped in a generational curse, which does not allow her love & marriage and her lover who vows to conquer this curse. Will she come over the curse? 'Shaapit' is a fantastic idea, and so is Bhatt's direction. But the writing falters, especially in the second hour. The climax also is embarrassing and leaves no impact. Anyways, it has it's share of eerie moments, which leave a impact.Aditya Narayan makes a fine debut. Plus, he's a good singer. Shweta also does a fine job. Rahul Dev is fantastic in a supporting role. Others are adequate.'Shaapit' is an average watch, but it's worth a watch for Bhatt's terrific direction and Rahul Dev's fantastic performance." 
" Is this what we call 'horror'?","When I first heard about Shaapit, I was a li'l thrilled as it was a "The Vikram Bhatt" movie. Vikram Bhatt established himself in the area film direction with his super hit Raaz, a movie which will always stand the test of time. After Raaz, Vikram Bhatt seemed to loose his roots. His style, though present in bits in pieces, lacked that finesse that was present in Raaz. 1920 did provide some promise but the end result was far from satisfying. Shaapit is a movie which shouldn't have been made, a waste of money. The essence of a horror movie is the build up of the core plot and most importantly a horrifying ghost/monster. The build up was OK but the monster really sucked. 3rd grade CG used in portraying the ghost. Secondly, the emotional part of the lover duo was extended without any purpose. There wasn't any chemistry present between them. No match for the Dino-Bipasha pair. Thirdly, horror content of the movie was very low. Shhh...Phir Koi Hai of Star One would have done better than this movie. The positives of the movie were the thought behind the movie which could have been netter executed. Implementation of CG in Hindi horror for the 1st time perhaps. Locales. And Aditya to some extent. As a horror movie fan and a small time critic, I really would like to convey 1 or 2 things to Sir Vikram Bhatt. A love story isn't necessary to be included in a horror movie. Just once watch movies like Jeepers Creepers, Nightmare on the Elm Street, Night of the Living Dead, Grudge, Ring and Silent Hill. These movies are unorthodox, innovative, gory, psychologically impacting and super hits. Can't we make movies like this??? Isn't the Indian audience ready & mature enough to experience another level of thrill??? Is there a dearth of ideas and courage to make such movies??? I would say NO. We can definitely make much better movies than these, horror movies in the real sense. And, you Vikram Bhatt definitely is one of those people who are capable of making such movies. As for summarising Shaapit, I think it should be skipped for some other task worthy of our time.micky23" 
" Shaapit = 60% slumber + 40% horror!","I think this is the 1st Vikram Bhatt movie I've seen, and the impression I get is that he makes movies that look interesting at the edges but deep down is boring. Indeed, he does a decent job of creating creeps for the audience. Also, this movie has pleasant music and nice show of horror.But the movie package as a whole needs to be good too. I find the choice of cast to be hmm...err...funny. Aditya Narayan could have made a better debut in a romantic comedy. Although he acts well, he looks misplaced here. A serious drama lead at the beginning of his career doesn't seem like a good idea. Rahul Dev makes for a better villain than a know-it-all ghost expert. And the heroine Shweta Agarwal is okay-doke. Her role was really weak. Half the time, she's lying in bed :) And, lot of unexciting talks on the ghosts & spirits among the main characters that you lose whatever little interest you've had on the movie.Verdict: A dull horror movie, despite chweetie Aditya Narayan :)" 
" Awful","Just saw this movie, couldn't help myself to write the review. Well I was tempted to see this movie as I liked some the Vikram Bhatt movies, but this was totally out his league (inversely). Well the plot building was pretty good. But somewhere in the middle he lost it.Initially the reason for the curse was something and in the end it changed to something else. Then I thought the Kaya was from the royal family, so I couldn't reason why Aman would not be able to manage a free ticket to the palace. Then if the spirit was suppose to be so strong why would it possess the professor's body. So ultimately the plot was a waste.But the direction again was awesome. The set was good. So was the environment and the music. And even the spirit was pretty impressive. But what with the crawling on the wall. So ultimately the rating from me would so-so.PS: Here comes Aditya Narayan, pretty impressive, watch out for him. He is a talented actor." 
" Just not worth a watch","The only plus of this movie is its cinematography which is no doubt A1. You may watch this movie for this at several places scenes look like paintings really amazing. If one person has to be blamed for failiure of this movie that is its editor. Random scenes were added which do not make sense. Characters are waiting for night in night (that is height of this and at this point i stopped watching this movie). Only if the story is edited little better it could be a decent movie. Acting of all lead actors including aaditya narayan was decent." 
" a brilliant concept, wasted.....","The basic premise of a curse living through centuries because it gets attached to a 'buri aatma' (evil soul), and Vikram Bhatt's previous attempt '1920â€² was what made me go to the theatre to watch Shaapit. But, what finally turned up on-screen was way too bad. The face of the 'buri aatma' felt like a straight lift out of an old Ramsay flick. The accident in the beginning as well as the next car scene was a pure wtf moment. Aditya Narayan looks good and has screen presence, but he has a long way to go in terms of acting. The actress Shweta Agrawal was a bad choice. And also, there love story was very unconvincing, you never feel for them. Rahul Dev was OK, but some of his scenes were pretty long winding, his character could have been a lot better. There were two scenes in the post-interval portions which could be counted as good, but they are not enough to salvage this mess. There was no need for songs in this movie, but still there are and they irritate, a lot! Also, the reference to Mayans, Incas, and all the Theban language thing didn't work at all. A brilliant concept wasted." 
" Partially interesting rehashed version of Ramsay Brother's "Purana Mandir".","There are mainly only two formulas of making Horror movies in Bollywood. One is to easily go for an urban scary tale inspired from the foreign horror films famous in various parts of the world. And second is to go back to our own tried and tested formula of Ramsay brothers involving Kings & Queens of the past era. Vikram Bhatt tasted success with "Raaz" made on the first one and now comes up with "Shaapit" made on the second formula mentioned above. His latest venture reveals the secret of a curse being faced by only the girls of a family from many generations. When the young lead couple of the story deeply in love, are told about this curse by their parents, then instead of compromising with the situation, they decide to go on a search for the evil spirit and finish it off. The same plot was earlier used by Ramsay brothers in their 1984 movie "Purana Mandir" and now Vikram Bhatt uses it again with some re-touches of his own along with the new advanced technology and gimmicks.Initially, the movie does well to keep the viewer interested. The ground work to introduce various characters and situations is well worked upon and impresses. But on the later stages, the story loses the grip and starts boring you with its prolonged sequences and proceedings. However, in the first hour, "Shaapit"' has few worth watching scenes like the one where the boy goes for stealing a cursed book from the library and when the girl sees an old lady lying on the road in front of her car. But post intermission the movie relies heavily upon the action scenes between the human and the spirit and those too are stretched to a great extent.Ideally a horror movie should never be lengthy enough, leading to loss of interest. It should be very fast and quick, which scares you off at once and doesn't provide any dull moments for thinking. Unfortunately, Shaapit scores very low in this direction as its quite lengthy requiring a great amount of trimming from its director. Post interval, even after the whole secret has been revealed to the viewers, they still have to wait too long for the movie to get over. And that proves to be the biggest drawback of an otherwise average Shaapit.The special effects used in various scenes are also in huge contrast with each other. At one end the graphics representations are good enough to scare you off but at the same time, they are very childishly done in a different scene. For instance, in the climax scene, where the water starts pouring in from the broken wall, you can clearly see "the blurred chroma cutting edges" around the characters and elements. (Readers having the knowledge of graphics and editing would easily understand what I am referring to.)But there is one major contribution made by the movie in the form of "Aditya Narayan", who is a complete natural in front of the camera and is really a blessed child of the Holy Creator. He is the best example of the fact that a Star Child is just not given a chance due to his family connections. He was chosen for the role only because the director could see that he can act. Aditya, not only looks smart and fresh on screen, but he also delivers a polished act without any signs of nervousness on screen. Along with his singing, acting is another aspect of his future career, for which he should now seriously plan and think, as we are willing to see more of him pretty soon.Shweta doesn't get much scope on screen as most of the time she is lying on the hospital bed in coma and gets no major scenes to show her talent. Thankfully Rahul Dev is not over the top this time and makes an impact. Debutant Shubh Joshi acts well with great confidence and rest all in the cast do justice to their roles as required. In the music section, two songs seem to be interesting while watching the movie. Especially "Tere Bina" has got the pain of separation and love. But still the music is not as rich as compared to the earlier hits given by Vikram Bhatt. Background music is loud at times but rightly provides the scary moments too when needed.On the whole, "Shaapit" is not a very fine horror flick, coming from the house of Vikram Bhatt this time. It has an interesting and watchable first half but crashes down to a large extent later on. The only worth mentioning merit of the movie is "Aditya Narayan" who forces you to notice him and his acting skills with Ã©lan." 
" Not as good as his earlier "1920"","When I watched Vikram Bhatt's previous horror outing "1920" I thought man, this guy has got some style. It was like giving stiff competition to Ramgopal Verma. And with the same expectation levels if you happen to watch "Shaapit", the whole experience is so Ramsay Bros. The writing is culprit, too many cinematic liberties. In terms of execution there are huge lapses. The love-track between the couple loaded with infatuation. One would expect an impact when Rahul Dev enters, sadly his character shapes up to blue-collar quack. The scary moments are glorified Ramsay's flick. The climax should have been trimmed to make it sleek. The period drama portion deserve special mention though.The cat is out of the bag that Aditya Narayan has chosen unwisely. He lacks screen-presence. Shweta Agarwal barely has anything to contribute in second half. The chemistry between the pair is zero. Natasha Sinha apes Ila Arun. The performance of the priest who sets the curse in motion deserves special mention.On a whole "Shaapit" barely escapes being classified a B-grade flick.PS: Nearly forgot, I am enlightened that a few centuries ago even the royal blood had a penchant for item songs!"
