" Just Bakwas","If you are a die hard Salman Khan fan ..... then you may like this movie....otherwise it is just CRAP!!!!!!It looked better than his previous movies..... but I was totally wrong.....It was a whole lot worse.This movie has the Worst ending ever............unjustifiable dialogues(so what u can expect from a Salman khan movie)......just look at some of Salman khans previous movies..... Wanted,Dabaang,Ready,and now Bodyguard....all looks each others sequels.... nothing new..... nothing innovative......weird dance steps invented by Salman himself.....Due to people like these......level of Bollywood movies is declining day by day....Bollywood people used to make remakes of Hollywood movies..... and now they have started to make remakes of South Indian movies..... It is a step backwards.....Please don't watch this movie......Waste of time and money" 
" total full of CRAPS....","this is the worst i could ever imagined...stale story line up, stale expressions,awful and mindless south Indian action... Bodyguard featured Salmaan...after giving a crap like Ready what anyone could expect from this.this movie is better than ready but not upto mark of the star cast.... movie is inspired from a a south Indian movie and also from one of Hindi movie's love story... movie contains action,comedy, drama but the only good part in the movie is the music....few songs are good n hummable....this movie is a total waste of money and time because it is awe-fully bad n STALE... so better keep out of this one....." 
" Unbelievably intolerable","Though a reasonable storyline, the screenplay doesn't do justice. Very ordinary performances. Over the top actions with unjustifiable dialogues, which is a very common thing for a Salman Khan movie; as is expected. Worth a watch if you are a die-hard fan. Music is pretty good. So is the choreography, especially the Katrina Kaifeng sequence.The story starts with unquestionable irregularities buts cuts it pretty okay for about half an hour with a typical Salman entry as has become quite often in his movies. The second us pretty descent when compared to entire length. The music, specially the "I love you" number has been picturised well. The movie wasn't too long and the plot wasn't stretched either which is good thing and goes in the favor of the director. Unfortunately the same can't said for the direction of scenes itself. Overall an okay-one-time watch; then again, maybe not.Overall an okay or one time watch. Then again, maybe not." 
" The ending?? :( (Spoiler in review)","Hmmm... It's difficult to write a not-so-good review of a Salman Khan movie because of his fan-following but here it is-Salman is indebted to Raj Babbar for saving his life. He gets an assignment to protect Babbar's daughter- Kareena, who at first despises him but slowly falls in love. They talk over the phone so Salman doesn't know who his lady love is (Kareena is aware of this fact). Thus the movie continues with some funny moments, few romantic scenes etc.SPOILER!!! The weird part of the movie is the scene shown a few minutes before the ending. Why, why would someone write an ending like that? Out of NOWHERE, Kareena's best friend falls in love with Salman! They don't even show any such scene where the best friend pines over him or something before that. She hugs him once and falls in love! What a twist!That didn't exactly ruin the movie for me because I am not a fan of Salman movies, however, the 'twist in the story' was really stupid.There are good action scenes in the movie, some songs are nice. Kareena is good in the movie. I am sure this movie will do well in India because for some reason, people just love Salman. :)" 
" If There Were A Nobel For Movies That Make You Want To Die This Wins It All","Body guard is undoubtedly *the worst* movie of all time (including Tollywood Hollywood and any other wood u can think of) .. this is one movie which deserves a negative rating ! I wish people wouldn't be thins kind with ratings.. This movie doesn't even come close to being rational . A person with the tiniest of logic would want to pour acid in his eyes to relieve himself of the pain he just endured ... the movie has the random-est of beings and *the most terrible* ending of all time ! If i could i would go slap all those producers and action directors that directed this piece of cauliflower yes this movie is that bad ! The toy helicopters and flying actors just add to the misery of the rational audience . To sum it all I wouldn't watch this movie again even if i were paid a 1000 bucks for it !" 
" It may earn many more crores than before, but for me its like playing with the innocent loyalty of your millions of fans.","With this new EID release of another SALMAN KHAN movie, I would rather like to go for its review in a different mode.First of all let me tell you that as far as the economics of Film Business goes, this has "A New Blockbuster" written all over it without any doubt. Releasing on a national EID holiday (on Wednesday), with more than 2,500 prints and 10-15 shows in a multiplex, plus full houses in the single screen theaters too, How can such a film can ever flop, irrespective of its content or quality? Considering the phenomenal fan following of the STAR, it is bound to become a success in any case before even the week starts on Monday. So, if you want to know the box office result of the film, then in all possibilities this should make a hat-trick of Hits for Salman, unless the Indian viewers wake up miraculously from their media created sleep.Now secondly coming to the content of the film, what can one think of the story of a film, with the title BODYGUARD? Obviously it has to be the love story between the Bodyguard and the owner of the body he is guarding. Hence in that respect the film has got nothing new and it remains completely predictable from the first frame itself where the viewer very well knows what he is going to see in the next reels.So it all comes down to the treatment of the film, which sadly is again below the mark and not at all impressive as expected. Salman's magic is there for sure, but he is not given the perfect action or entertaining sequences which can win over the viewers as compared to his WANTED or DABANGG. The humor is pretty lifeless and sounds outdated with all 80s kind of jokes which fail to create the required impact. However, it seems that the writers were very much aware of its boring plot and therefore they thought of adding an unexpected twist towards its climax. But, believe me, this last reel addition is one of the most bizarre climaxes I have ever seen, written very poorly without any kind of sane, real life vision.In few words, it's a big disappointment in almost all its departments ranging from the story, script, direction and execution. Though the stars acts convincingly putting best of their efforts, but they alone are not capable of giving you a good time in the theater. Honestly speaking, I enjoyed only the first opening song when SALMAN enters the screen in the entire film and was really thinking why this was chosen to be re-made in Hindi since it had nothing to rave about in its script and content.Nevertheless, SALMAN is there with all his trademark moves in the film, along with doing another kind hearted gesture for his own real life bodyguard, Tiger. Very sportingly Salman wears the uniform of Tiger's own Security Agency and also makes Tiger dance standing next to him in the opening song. I guess that's one of the reason, why SALLU BHAI is loved all over the world for his numerous similar kind of humble, friendly acts.To end the review, I would like to tell you that why I almost walked out of the theater while watching BODYGUARD.The film is directed by the same director, for the third time in a different language. Now who would have done it to satisfy his creative urge? Clearly this was a project undertaken for money and money alone, otherwise what is the charm of directing the same script for the third time? As a real creatively concerned person, the director should have given the project to another talented upcoming director and he could have been the Creative Visualiser of the project to keep an overall look on it.But coming to the main point of my distress, there is a scene in the film, where people are standing around a pyre on which the dead body is lying covered in white. To be precise, this is a sequence in which they all have gathered to burn one of the main villains of the film, killed by Salman. Now, to my shocking surprise, the scene has been shot by the talented director in HEAVY RAINS. The water is pouring heavily from the sky, the pile of wood is all wet, the body is all wet and here come a person holding a burning mashaal to set the pyre on fire. And as filmy it can get, he also successfully puts the pyre on fire and then we are shown the body burning calmly just in the middle of a heavy rainfall.If this is what you call direction then Sorry, I am not interested in writing about this film anymore. For me its just like playing with the innocent loyalty of your millions of fans. And all the BIG STARS like SALMAN really need to give it a serious thought." 
" Lousy screeplay, bad directing, wrong casting...and, too many clowns","This movie is for the brain dead. Spent so much money and manpower to make this poorly crafted movie was absolutely unworthy. Salman Khan is still a quite good action actor, but he has played so many similar superman-like roles in so many similar movies, I doubt he'd still enjoy this kind of formulaic role. Being an action hero character must be very tiresome, that might be the reason why Sean Connery refused to play the 007 after several similar no-depth, no soul killing machine for the British secret service. Salman Khan should also take a serious consideration of his acting career, because he's getting old and getting heavier. Asking Kareena Kapoor to play the daughter of a super rich and super powerful man was actually a very bad casting job. Because she's too old to play a college student, and her acting talent is not quite boundless but limited. I've seen many of her movies, but never considered her a good enough actor.This screenplay was so poorly put together, full of jerk and clown-like characters, the directing obviously did a very poor job too. The most serious problem of this movie is such kind of storyline, scenario and plot have already been repeated so many times, there's indeed no need to add another bomber into this same old same old crap." 
" Huge Disappointment","Before release I had massive expectations from this movie considering it had salman khan who is in golden form, top actress kareena kapoor and hit music ! Bodyguard was huge letdown - as nothing is good in this movie except music ! Performances - Salman Khan is not up to mark in this movie. He was average. Hope he does better in next movie. Kareena Kapoor was okay. Villains were funny than scaring. Rest provide average support except Rajat Rawail who was horrible.Story, Direction all were pedestrian. Music was highlight of movie.Especially Teri Meri And I Love You song.Salman is having great run but such movie will hamper his golden run as audiences today are unforgiving if u gave them bad products. Wish best for him in Ek Tha Tiger and Sharekhan and he will come back to form again.In Other Words, Bodyguard is huge disappointment 3/10" 
" sucked big time","the movie has no story, sorry ass comedy, just some ass kicking, totally not worth watching full of crap movie.Salman's acting sucked as well as Kareena's.even the bullshit story was stolen from south Indian movie.i think Salman want to be the Rajnikant of Bollywood.its as bad as ready,empty plot,no acting,no special direction,crappy script with disturbing songs i don't how did it went blockbuster hit. this is not film making,this is movie is just a humiliation for Bollywoodnot worth watching waste of money and time if you love Salman and want to watch this movie just to show your support,then you should be ashamed of your self. go watch "that girl in yellow boots" if you want to see a good film. to conclude bodyguard is just bullshit" 
" worse than bad","unless you have 12 kids or believe in having your own gold elephant then you will not like this film. you know dancing weak looking little guy probably plays for the other team and this freak is the hero. lots of dancing extras. just pure rubbish acting stereotyping at its very worst, talk about how to show a people in a bad light. i have seen many Bollywood films and this goes up there with superman really have to see that one just cause its so bad this film is so bad i want to go to war. well apparently i have to write 10 lines of how much i hate this film yes its really really bad, so bad it gave my neighbour cancer,cause he heard 1 minute of the music,this film caused a zombie attack to be cancelled because they did not want to come back as long as this existed" 
" Waste of time and money","The 'Try to be' remake of Dabangg but its all waste and crappy. One body guard trying to protect our heroine from the villain but there is one thing missing, the Story. There is no story in this film and to make some money out of it main attractions has been all the cast list. I would advice Salman Khan to stop experimenting because Dabangg was one family venture which went all excellently right but this piece of crap is down the drain. No doubt the action is good but acting is very poor and also the story line Two Hollywood movie stories cannot make one Hindi movie. Telegu action sequences OK acceptable. Salman's acting have also deteriorated in this movie other than Dabang. I give only 3 out of 5 to Salmans action and total movie acting rest of the cast sorry to say, made a mess." 
" What nonsense!!??!!","Well ... eid time .... n here comes BODYGUARD!! Humongous response to the movie. But !! What is in the movie???STORY - Lovely Singh ( Salman Bhai) is a bodyguard who is hired by Sartaj Rana( Raj Babbar)for protecting his daughter Divya (Kareena). Lovely Singh is sincere towards his duty and follows Divya everywhere who is with her best friend Maya (Hazel Kheech);classroom , bathroom , bedroom. Divya just wants to get rid of him , therefore she call Lovely through her "special phone" as Chaya and starts flirting with him. Lovely falls in love . He then saves Divya from the goons , also Divya falls in love with him. So basically there are more twists n turns in d story but actually ... THERE IS NO STORY AT ALL!!!Comedy - special mention to TSUNAMI SINGH (Rajat Rawali) for his comedy. Thats the best thing in the movie.Action - it is unbelievable and looks more like a comedy.basically the movie is intolerable.So only watch the movie .... unless you r a die hard fan of salman (like me) and ready to forget the flaws in the movie.... But basically its a waste of time . 3/10." 
" bad movie","what a load of crap! the movie was terrible. honestly the worst movie i've ever seen. there was no tension, no suspense no action no drama no comedy.nothing. it was a string of random pointless scenes to lead to a pointless outcome. This movie was even worse than Dabangg. Salman should be ashamed to take people's money for this awful mess. It was OK my rating * out of *****. Salman is really going from bad to worse.Disgusting humor. The problem is basically everything you HEAR.. the dialog, the story you're being told, and the completely subpar music. Was this screenplay written by some amateur Youtuber? Do these people have any understanding of what makes an action/adventure movie WORK? Sadly no. I guess being handed the reigns of a well developed, awesome character with screen-worthy stories already fleshed out and perfect was too difficult for 'em - they had to release this crap." 
" Pathetic and Terrible","bodyguard is so bad that i wanted to slit my wrist and throat while watching the movie... For me this movie takes the Oscar for bad action bad comedy bad story and worst acting.... those Tsunami(fat)jokes in the name of comedy were awe-full... more awe-full was the complete mindless action...come on salman fight like a human not some god... the story was worst... the script writer should be imprisoned for writing such a bad script...I really request the people of India to stop making these movies hit at the box office...Salman stop doing this mindless crap in the name entertainment... i am not a fan of salman but after watching this piece of crap i simply hate him" 
" I really wanted this to be a good movie but...","First thing first, I really wanted this to be a good movie(just for a change as for my past experience with sallu-starrer movies), but alas...So, what went wrong? Apparently everything. Awful direction, bad action sequences, brain-dead story-line and a lot of confusion.Though there are few songs that you can hum around and then there are few shots where you can find a little (probably a very little) character playing but they are pretty rare and for most of the movie it looked like a Big-Salmanized-Version of 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'(whether a son reading his dead mother's diary) or 'Ghajini'(concealing the identity with role reversal).Few stunts that you have to believe to be deliberately shot like that way(Nobody in right frame of mind can imagine something so..give me the word...stupid) can send chills down your spine.Yet again Salman khan proved that in Bollywood its the star cast that makes the movie successful. Perhaps times for him to prove something to himself too." 
" A love story which happens to be a masala movie.","After Dabbang and Ready, this film is going to be third consecutive feather in Salman's cap.I felt a little disappointed with the treatment of the movie. The screenplay rushed at an odd pace. The first half was intriguing and speedy, but the second half stammers a bit. Again, in the last 20 minutes, we see a hurricane of emotions.The movie has all the proportionate elements of a Masala Movie, but I seriously felt a letdown in the humor quotient of the movie. The so- called "Tsunami Singh" was a high disappointment, rather than him, his T Shirts looked funny. The dialogues were above average.A die-hard Salman fan might get disappointed, but it was a pleasure seeing Salman in a romantic movie; that too; was totally unexpected. Music boosted the movie, due to which, the faulty screenplay gets sidelined.Salman Khan is in top notch here. Kareena is back in the form. Mahesh Manjrekar, Aditya Pancholi, Raj Babbar are remarkable. Rajat Rawail as Tsunami is a letdown. He acts well sans comic timing.Editing by Sanjay Sankla is good, he manages to keep the movie on track in spite of futile screenplay. Cinematography by Sejal Shah is marvelous. Himesh Reshammiya has lived up to the expectations from the fans. Background score from Sandeep Shirodkar is top class.After watching this one, my recent favorites from Salman goes in the following order. 1. Dabbang 2. Bodyguard 3. Wanted 4. ReadyFinally, watch it! Even if you are not a Salman Khan fan, you wont regret watching this one."
