" Another over hyped salman movie","Ready is a success only because of the 'presence' of salman..aneez thought that he could keep making cash using akshay,but since the people understood akshay is useless,'thankyou' flopped..now aneez is using the next mega hyped star,salman....result-megahit.. Ready was corny and had a illogical plot..some can say plot is compromised for the comedy but Ready has just one or two funny scenes....acting was avg,fans of salman will find his acting&comedy good,but for others salman is also avg.. Being a aneez basmi movie,the plot is made on the way..direction was awful.. The movie is a timepass,so leave your brain,heart and other useful organs at the door and then you can truly enjoy this movie...." 
" TEES MAAR KHAN was better!!!","READY !!! One of the movies that give you a big headache.The film is about two brothers ready to kill each other over some easy money they stand to make if either of their sons gets married to Asin. But Asin is a smart cookie, so she gets ready to elope and cons Salman and his family into believing that she is the perfect girl who will set everything in place for them. Salman's family gets ready to get the couple married, but Asin's uncles are not ready for this. So Salman pulls off a con game thanks to Paresh Rawal, who is ready to help him.None of the above was a spoiler. But did any of it make any sense to you? No? Good. So you are ready for wholesome entertainment? Of course not! This is a total Salman Khan movie... which is over hyped. Asin looks awesome and delivers more than expected. Paresh Rawal was the best and Salman Khan was like he always is - "I .... ME ...AND... MYSELF" .No idea what chunkey pandey was doing in it. Funny cameo's by Ajay Devgn and Sanjay Dutt.But it was a miserable movie. Go and watch it if u idolize SALMAN KHAN or don't waste money on such a crap. Songs are awesome.My ratings :- 2/10 ( tmk was better)" 
" Be "READY" with a asprin!!!","I loved Wanted for what it was - A refreshing change from the typical Bollywood drama and it had one of the most hilarious villains ever. Then came Dabbang which broke all possible records and ended up winning a National Award, God alone knows for what. It definitely took the credibility of the National Awards down the crapper. But I must say that both Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan are leaving no stone unturned in proving it to the world that the IQ of an average Indian Movie goer is most definitely less than that of a donkey(no offense Mr. Donkey). But its like you just hang a damn carrot in front of that ass and it follows irrespective of the fact that hes never gonna get to eat it. Similarly these so called superstars of our industry have found the perfect recipe for a carrot so tempting that we like donkeys(again no offense Mr. Donkey) flock towards the multiplexes and shell out our hard earned money just like that. But all things said and done there are certain things that neither me nor the world were "READY" for -The enormity of the crap that was thrown at my face in the name of entertainment...The very painful 3 hrs of expressionless antics which Salman so proudly calls Acting...Asin with an inch thick layer of makeup..Salman shaking the unmentionables with his hands deep down in his pockets to the tune of Dhinka Chika and a bunch of school kids following in the backdrop..Yeah definitely Being Human!!!A series of not so funny guest appearances by superstars which by the way is totally irrelevant to the story... wait a minute there was no story... sorry my bad!!!The secret that the Indians have taken over Thailand and that the Thai race is extinct...A couple dozen very noisy characters related to each other in such complexity that only Ekta Kapoor can figure out who's who...Salman Khan peeing on a haystack to announce the pee break which by the way is the interval..Yeah thats what we want the people to be doing in the name of Hero-Worship!!! Act responsible Mr.Salman...A couple of negative characters named after salmans heroic flops Veer and YuvraajThe climax where one of the goons gets his ass kicked with a flower...yes u read it rite, with a flower...And finally, Salman's arrogance in finding out how little can he get away with...I rest my case!!!AS I SEE IT please don't go into the movie expecting sense. Or sensibility.And especially if you don't Hero-worship Salman be "READY" with an asprin!!!" 
" An ode to tastelessness","Indian cinema is at a crossroad of modernization whereby new breed of directors is taking Indian cinema into world platform. With big stars like Aamir Khan moving into meaningful cinema it is sad that few stars are coming in between development. Yeah I agree there are different genre of films which caters to different taste but there is a thin line between commercial and tasteless. While Dabang had something new to offer in terms of execution thanks to abhinav Singh Kashyap, Ready relies on orthodox potboilers which are on the verge of obsolescence. Ready has an wafer thin hackneyed story line which begins with rich spoil brat Salman Khan (as Prem) whose profession was probably "helping people" . and like any "unique" story he falls in love with beautiful Asin (as Sanjana) but wait like any original love story there is a twist in this tale. There are evil cha-chas eyeing for Sanjana's wealth and Prem goes on to save his lady love. In the meantime there is moral gyans of perfect families and all expected possibilities in an Hindi film from the 80s. It is sad that Aneez Bazmee scripted (rather remade) such a boring script only to cash in Salman's star status and sadly the film might become the biggest grosser of all time decelerating Indian cinema to the backwardness from which movies like Satya,Dil Chahta Hai,Dev D and lots of young directors did their best to change the notion of Indian cinema. The film trying to be a supposed family entertainer is full of double innuendos and toilet humour. In a particular scene a guy runs and in the motion farts out loudly.Can this be termed as a comedy ? or sample this one a boy pisses on the mouth of a goon. The scenes had nothing wacky in execution and it seems tasteless to me. Well least said about Aneez Bazmee is better with movies like No problem, thank you and now Ready he is epitome of mockery of cinema. Salman Khan as usual repeats himself and he was nowhere near his earlier Chulbul Pandey act which had freshness in it. Instead Prem is a typical rich brat with a heart of gold, a character types which has been repeated since time immemorial. Asin is expressionless at her best. The supporting cast involves some of the big names of the industry like Paresh Rawal,Mahesh Manjrekar,Sharad Saxena,Akhilendra Mishra,Manoj Pahwa and credit should be given to Bazmee for bringing out loud performances from otherwise natural comedians. When the Indian film industry started churning quality cinema it is indeed sad to see few stars helping directors to go back to medieval age of meaningless films. Ready will be blockbuster but then this film marks the backward journey of Indian cinema for sure. Till star adoration is there no one can improve quality of Indian cinema." 
" Its a feeble show as expected from Aneez Bazmee.","Before moving into the review, I would like to state that I love MASALA MOVIES made for the masses, a lot. And in fact I used to be one of the few people in the hall who dared to shout, whistle and dance whenever their favorite hero or song came on the screen. But those were the years of the last century and the changing times have hugely changed the movie watching experience a lot (may be for the better, as they say). However from the inside, I still remain the same excited moviegoer, who readily feels the butterflies in his stomach while watching his lovable hero dancing on a HIT song being flashed on the silver screen.For the record, I immensely enjoyed last two movies of Salman and could easily appreciate and relate with the star enigma in DABANGG. But this time, I really was unable to either appreciate or enjoy the trash served hot in the shape of READY this Friday. While watching it I was neither able to cherish the lovable Salman Khan acting his own-self on the screen nor I could take pleasure in the two HIT songs being played loud. In short, the film is a complete washout right till the end with only a few places where you are able to laugh out loud.It starts off with a usual and needless 2 minute credit animation sequence and then after the not so happening entry of Salman you right away get the first item song. There is simply no story development in its initial hour and before the intermission, all its characters are just moving here and there on the screen with a little pinch of love, hate, action, chase and all the usual stuff. In other words, there is nothing in the name of WRITING in its first half.The story, (if you consider it a story at all) actually starts off post intermission and then at least you get a few scenes which make you smile and laugh with your loved hero. But then the climax as expected from the director Aneez Bazmee, is another bizarre one from him where the villains get beaten in a comic style and they even enjoy the shower of little boys delivering from the first floor. The film simply reveals the lack of vision in its Captain of the ship despite of the fact that he had the TELUGU original in front of him as a base to work upon. The director in a very silly and questionable manner keeps following the South flavor of the subject and makes no changes at all as per the likings of the Hindi Film viewers. For instance few of his earlier films were a remake of their South Originals too, yet you never felt that while seeing them. But strangely while watching READY in the first half, I had the feeling as if I was watching a dubbed South Hit film on a Cable TV Channel.Its no-doubt a Salman film all the way, but somehow this time I even couldn't enjoy Salman's performance too as he doesn't seem to be acting in the movie at all. To be straight, Salman plays his character in a very cool but careless kind of style which even looks a bit over- confident and over the top at times. For instance, just watch out the scenes where both Salman and Asin are hanging from a tree or when Salman turns over declaring the intermission. Though I did enjoy some realistic kind of dialogues and one liners by Salman in the movie but overall it surely cannot be included in the list of the actor's better performances of his career ever.Asin on the other hand looks both ravishing as well as tired in her various sequences. May be she should blame her stylist and make-up artist for that. Paresh Rawal tries hard but doesn't get any good lines or scenes (making an entry post interval). And the entire rest of the cast do more of shouting than acting. Sanjay Dutt, Ajay Devgan, Arbaaz Khan, Chunky Pandey and Kangna don't add any extra value to the film in their one scene appearance. But Zarine Khan looks hot in her item number. Musically the two HIT songs of the film give their much required support to its overall impact on the audiences especially through their superb choreography. Whereas its Cinematography and Background score, both just serve the purpose.Summing up, I would like to say that in India, since star worship is the main guiding force towards film-making, therefore READY would surely be seen and loved by all Salman fans as a must. But the film certainly would not get a unanimous positive response as earlier enjoyed by few Salman releases. And for this I don't blame SALMAN and neither I blame the producers or actors of the film. For this feeble and unexplainable kind of attempt I entirely blame its director Aneez Bazmee who constantly keeps giving us films like these and this time he even fails to encash one of the biggest craze of our nation, Salman Khan.So if you love Salman, then do watch READY only to satisfy your star- love. But truly speaking I enjoyed watching Mahesh Manjrekar & Sudesh Lehri more in the film than anybody else along with the gorgeous Asin." 
" As Always! Mass-Puller-Salman-Movie","Stress Buster! Fultoo Entertainer! Enriched with Comedy that will make you forget everything! This film will pull you into its world and you will realize, as it progresses, the movie is a Paisa Vasool.The Song Character Dheela gets the film starting and it rocked the entire theater. Whistles n Dances among the viewers; even I couldn't resist!Ultimate comedy in the second half, you might get choked if you are having snacks/drinks! Warning! Don't take your brains to the theater. Let it rest @ Home!Believe me a must watch for every family! Enjoy!" 
" Ready is a complete entertainer","Salman Khan continues his super act with gusto. Salman and Asin are the soul of the film and they are the reason why READY works. Asin convinces with her performance and portrayal of the character Sanjana. She was just gorgeous and was complementing Salman the super star of the movie. The chemistry between super star Salman and lady gorgeous Asin works big time. Paresh Rawal is excellent and their comedy tracks fun filled. Sudesh Lehri too made a solid impact. He was exceptional and brought the house down with his style of comedy.The songs Dhinka Chika and Character Dheela was extraordinary and Hum ko pyar hua and Meri Ada Bhi too was nice. Over all Ready is a blockbuster written all over it. One could feel Salman can never get it wrong these days. Its a big dhamaka for all Salman fans. Don't miss the fun. . Ready is a must watch. ." 
" Hopeless as much as it can be","Here comes another over hyped typical headache giving movie from Salman Khan. Not at all worth the time wasted watching it. Some funny action scenes which seem totally idiotic and those baseless and not so funny jokes make the movie an awful experience to watch!!! The story lies on a baseless ground with almost no interest for a viewer to keep him glued to the mainframe. Watch this movie only if you are a die hard Salman Khan fan... Rest otherwise!!! Try investing your money in some good movie. wonder how long will this over hype of salman khan continue... He must try retiring and do something which does not cause headache to the audience." 
" Very funny stress-buster","I'll keep this very simple. If you are looking for intelligent, social-issues based, self-interrogative, catharsis or exploratory cinema, then stay the hell away from this movie. It is not made for elite people like you, who watch every movie as if they have to give a certification based on that movie or they have to answer the press-conference questions on that movie.If you are looking a movie that can take you into the world of its own, having a simple story, lots of laughter, and with a happy ending, then this is a movie for you. Don't miss it. Its the stress-buster you need.Asin looks gud and her performance is top-notch, at least better than what she did in Gajini. Paresh rawal is ever dependable. Sudesh lehri has almost stolen the scenes in which he is present, even if that scene has Salman and Asin in them. Mahesh manjrekar and his two brothers (in the movie), have given good cameos. Above all, its Salman who anchors the movie with his ever so stunning screen presence and his ability to hold your attention. Humour in the movie is sweet and family-friendly and not raunchy. Its my kind of movie and I enjoyed it." 
" watch READY as a stress-busting therapy that makes you smile, laugh and break into guffaws in those two hours.","So are you ready for the first biggie of the season? Who isn't, actually? Love him, loathe him, but you can't overlook him. Salman Khan is, without doubt, the sweetheart of the masses. No two opinions on that!But here's a word of caution. READY is NOT for the rigid detractors or counterfeit scholars of Hindi cinema who masquerade as messiah of meaningful cinema. They rebuke ms-ala films, ridicule big stars, detest anything and everything associated with 'commercial cinema' -- a genre cherished by a wide majority of audiences. They wrote off DABANGG which recently won the coveted National Award], pulled down the super entertainer GOLMAAL 3, scoffed at YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA the biggest hit of 2011 so far], even panned the iconic 3 IDIOTS which ranks as the biggest grosser of Hindi cinema], but these films had the mandate of the junta and that's what matters eventually. Isn't it? In fact, READY re-invents the much revered formula in contemporary idiom. Plot-wise, there's not much to talk about, you may call it behind the times, but it's a vehicle that showcases the star charisma and magnetism of Salman and the actor hits the bull's eye yet again. He has a ball on screen and makes sure the viewer joins the festivity as well. READY is a full-on entertainer, a Pisa visual film that has just one motive -- entertainment -- and it succeeds in its endeavor absolutely. This is a Salman show all the way and even those who don't hero-worship him will be forced to admit that like WANTED and DABANGG, Salman's dynamic presence and powerhouse performance translates into great entertainment. He's comical, wicked, aggressive, besides larger than life and yet warm and real. READY has the sort of music one would expect from an entertainer. Tracks have a larger-than-life feel and gel well with the content. The action sequences, not many though, are done in an enticing mix of mast and mayhem. Especially the chase in the end and the sequence when Salman shows off his exceptional physique - the viewers are sure to go into frenzy. Salman Khan continues his super act with gusto. He's the soul of the film and the reason why READY works. Asin convinces in parts. At times you feel that she's got it right, but there are sequences where she looks ill at ease. Paresh Rawal is excellent and compliments Salman beautifully. I'd like to single out one more actor - punster Sudesh Lehri - who makes a solid impact. He's exceptional and brings the house down with his style of comedy. On the whole, READY is strictly for the masses and for those who relish typically formulaic ms-ala entertainers. The film prides itself with super music 'Character Dheela' and 'Dhinka Chika', gags and gimmicks aplenty and of course, Salman Khan, the beloved of the masses and the mainstay of this film. If you hero-worship Salman, you cannot afford to miss this one. Even if you don't hero-worship him, watch READY as a stress-busting therapy that makes you smile, laugh and break into guffaws in those two hours." 
" This movie is Hilarious !","I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because this is the only movie that made me cry because of excessive laughter at several scenes. * and that doesn't happen a lot* Yea, it's not on-going in the whole movie but you can't expect a movie to be filled with crazy laughter like that. Salman Khan of course does it again. His style and his dancing and his dialogue delivery makes this movie! I am going to watch this movie one more time in the theaters for sure and you can sign me up in buying myself a DVD or a Bluray for this movie. I highly suggest you take the whole family to watch this comic adventure. You're going to laugh with the crowd sitting next to you the whole time." 
" Ye gods, can Indian cinema get any worse?","It would seem that Indian cinema is in a downward spiral led by the desire of Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan to prove who is actually the worst actor in India and the most incapable of performing in comedy roles. If this effort is any indication to go by, Indian cinema is in a very, very, very bad state.Good points? Well, Asin as ever looks absolutely gorgeous and illuminates the screen every second she is on. Paresh Rawal is also as ever excellent. Some of the cameos are good. Err, a couple of the songs are excellent. That's about it I am afraid.Bad points? Way to many to list unfortunately. I am guessing this was an attempt at some slapstick humor Bollywood style but it missed the mark by such a long distance it is not funny (no really, it is not funny). Its a turgid 3 hours indeed when you don't even get anything remotely resembling a good laugh out of a comedy.Okay, we all know that Salman Khan cannot act to save his life but please, can we at least get one film without him removing his shirt to show off his physique? Its getting boring... and honestly it isn't that great. Some of the action sequences are laughably bad (sorry, there was a laugh in the film!), characters are clichéd beyond the ridiculous, the plot is non-existent (more like a collection of short films that may or may not be edited together in a coherent way), nothing in the way of originality to be found and they really didn't even take the opportunity to properly use some of the great locations Thailand would have given them.Basically a formulaic film to showcase the dubious talents of Salman Khan. The only reason it gets 4/10 is because of Asin - otherwise it would barely get 2/10. If you are looking for some mindless entertainment (or are obsessed with Salman Khan) then this might just about suit but there are definitely plenty better out there, even from Salman." 
" A film for the illiterate and uneducated","This film has no proper story, no structure, nothing unique, typical salman style...What's so great about this film? Why is everyone loving it? Such mainstream rubbish in the name of entertainment...Look at the type of films that release everywhere in the world!Only this type of a film can do so well in India...Mindless, childish, stupid, superficial, badly made, cheap....Salman showing off his abs, no story, the dances were alright....But what was the point?When such innovative, provocative, and unique films get ignored in India, films like THIS, Welcome, Singh in Kinng, Houseful and all the other "MASALA" Rubbish become box office blockbusters...In a land where their is so much culture, tradition, history, folklore, etc etc, most Hindi films are either copies of foreign films or mimicry of western styles...The worst thing is that the audience prefers such mediocre films over quality...Meanwhile, mediocre films are also awarded and given publicity on T.V...Quality is completely ignored in India and this film is a disgusting example as to how such mediocrity can do well...I thought India was a land of intellect? Do people read in India? I would understand if such a film would do well in the rural parts, but even the middle class, so called "educated" public are going to watch this movie...." 
" Salman the best Forget the rest","Ready has no story basically! Directed by Anees Bazmee(who directed abysmal comedies such as No Problem and Thank You) does a better job this time.The film's highlight is Salman Khan,without doubt.He is the soul of the movie.Talking about the comedy,the film offers kitsch comedy.The story is average.The music is ordinary barring "Dhinka Chika" and "Character Dheela".Performance wise.Salman Khan is the soul of this movie.He simply rocks!Asin is dull.Paresh Rawal is superb!Suedesh Lehri(Comedy Circus Fame) is another comedian to watch out.He is excellent.Ready boasts of many supporting characters,but the ones who stand out are Mahesh Manjrekar,Manoj Joshi,Manoj Pahwa,Sharat Saxena and Akhilendra Mishra. None of the ladies work.Arya Babbar is wasted.Ready also has two characters named after Salman's two flop movies Veer and Yuvraj,who are bad.Puneet Issar is okay.Hemant Pandey is plain Ready has several guest appearances out which Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn work.Zarine Khan sizzles in Character Dheela.Kangna Ranaut needs to improve her dialog delivery.Arabaaz Khan is ordinary.Chunkey Pandey is average.On the whole Ready is Salman's show.Watch it if you worship him!" 
" Time for Salman Khan to retire","One of the worst film I have every seen. The only reason I went to watch this was due to me not watching any Bollywod movie for a while (at least 1 year). I left my brain at home before I went to the cinema. I wasn't expecting much from it. However, The first hour was just pure rubbish, second hour it picks up but with cheap jokes and real bad script the movie goes nowhere.This movie may do well due to the fact there aren't any big Bollywood release this summer. The only person that acted well in the movie was Paresh Rawal. I Will forgive me for selling his soul to save his life from Salman Khan.P.S. Salman Khan dude, just go to a acting class and learn some acting, what happened man?" 
" A waste of Time","Surely if nobody ties you on a chair with a Rope 50 times and u have to watch this movie..Please don't waste time and watch this Awful movie. A couple of stars trying to overact on a useless and baseless story.,a very terrible plotMay be u get a smile or laugh 2-3 times and thats it..U can go out to mall for window shopping, go swimming or do anything or even SLEEEP.DO NOT WATCH THIS. OR if u want to Watch, Watch this with below movies :1.) Yuvraaj 2.) Ram Gopal Verma Kee Aag 3.) DRONAEnjoy :)"
