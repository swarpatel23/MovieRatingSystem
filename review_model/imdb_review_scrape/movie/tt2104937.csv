" Fun and touching musical comedy.","I have not liked a musical in perhaps 13 years. I was surprised at how much I liked this one.Chirag is the child of a well-to-do family, and had to choose a parent when they split up. He would rather they get back together, which seems unlikely.The grown Chirag is involved in both his father's and his mother's successful business efforts. In addition, he's a tennis player. He alternates months spent with each parent. Each parent wishes Chirag would stay with them exclusively.He helps his young woman cousin start her own fashion line.His father and Manjit's father decide that Manjit and Chirag should marry. Manjit moves in with Chirag's father and takes over cooking. Chirag decides to act like he is interested in Anishka. The parents put pressure on Anishka to relinquish any claims on Chirag.The musical number where Chirag keeps insisting that he and Manjit are not together, but she insists that they are, is just hilarious.Chirag finally meets Anishka after the parents have tried to get her to cease and desist. Chirag's friend and Anishka's business manager cook up a deal for her to be Chirag's very public girlfriend for 20 days. Since Chirag is a pretty much a rock star, he gets a lot of attention from women other than Anishka, and after a while she begins to not like it.Manjit decides to leave Chirag's father's house; Chirag's cousin decides to go home; both Chirag and Anishka are unhappy about the charade coming to conclusion.Will there be a Hollywood ending?"
