" Simply Brilliant!!","First of all, a warm welcome to Priyadarshan and Akshaye Khanna. Priyadarshan had stopped making good films years ago, he was busy making guaranteed super flops with Mr. Kumar. Akshaye Khanna had disappeared from films long time ago. Both have made a good comeback with Aakrosh. And, after a long, long time, bollywood has come up with a brilliant and meaningful movie. Aakrosh deals with the honor killing that has been prominent in a few villages for the past few years. The movie also discloses the actual truth behind these alleged honor killings and the real culprits behind them. Three students from New Delhi are found missing from the village called Jhaanjhar for the last two months. Two CBI officers ( Ajay Devgn and Akshaye Khanna ) team up to find out the truth behind their disappearance. The Jhaanjhar village, crowded with numerous corrupt politicians is terrified with the attacks going on and the police force under the Superintendent officer( Paresh Rawal) does nothing. The CBI officers have had time doing the investigation as no one in the whole village is gutsy enough to speak against the attacks and the one who tries to open his mouth is abducted by those groups. Ajay Devgn, the hot blooded, loses his cool and takes some strong actions and Akshaye Khanna, the man with the brain, takes his chances and gambles. Hard work pays off well in the end and the truth finally comes out and the village then rests in peace.The movie has taken its inspirations from the recent cases of honor killing but on the whole it's a work of fiction. Acting Department is ruled by Ajay Devgn and Paresh Rawal. Both are in top form in this movie. Both are trying to outdo each other with their strong expressions and dialogue delivery. Akshaye Khanna, too has acted well but Ajay Devgn and Paresh Rawal are the show stealers. Reema Sen does well. Bipasha Basu is wasted. Action Sequences are top notch. The chasing scene between Ajay Devgn and a group leader is outstanding. Dialogues are awesome. A few of them even manage to bring a smile on your face and compel you to clap and praise! Cinematography is average. Editing could be better. Priyadarshan has directed the movie splendidly this time. He is sure to win many accolades this time. The only absurd part of the movie is the romantic song between Ajay Devgn and Bipasah Basu. To conclude, I would say go for it as finally a good Hindi movie has arrived (which actually is rare ) and for super strong performances of Ajay Devgn and Paresh Rawal.My Rating: 8/10 Thanks and Regards." 
" A Nutshell Review: Aakrosh","Besides the usual disclaimer that precedes a film that all incidents, characters and similarities portrayed within are coincidental at best, Priyadarshan's Aakrish takes one extra step to reinforce this point, as it wants to tackle the real world issue of "honour killing" on film, cobbling together a series of faux pas newspaper articles and stamping them as "Fact", before hammering a full size "Fiction" inter-title across the screen prior to the commencement of the film proper. And up until the last frame did it dawn upon me that the narrative also took issue, besides caste, with that of corrupt cops and politicians who exploit an inherently weak justice system.The story is sufficient to make you seethe with rage as we follow the investigations into the disappearance of three students, whose final moments will get enacted in due course, but only as we gain a certain foothold and breakthrough as experienced by the police officers Sidhant Chaturvedi (Akshaye Khanna) and Pratap Kumar (Ajay Devgan). Arriving from Delhi under the orders of the central government under pressure by a demonstrating student group seeking answers, the two protagonist have to quickly learn and get comfortable with each other's working style to maintain a certain degree of sanity as they tackle an environment that is most hostile, and alien to Sidhant, whose by-the-book methods are in danger of collapsing anytime.This especially so when faced with an uncooperative local police force who cooks up possibly every reason available not to do work, and through their blatant obstruction of justice, may seem to suggest some involvement in the primary case as well. While on one hand providing unintentional comedy, I feel the investigating officers' pain when they hit a brick wall from within their own support group who more often than not seem to be on the other side of the fence.It's the culture of silence that is most deafening, and for the first hour before the interval, Aakrosh is quite frustrating to sit through not because of its relatively slow pace, but how we see how helpless our heroes can be given their operating within red tape, and letting others rip them apart because processes rightfully bound them from hitting out. Those who have information are also cowered by threats and an innate fear that it's best to keep one's mouth shut, otherwise punishment will come in the form of bodily harm, and even death as dished out by the masked militia of men who call themselves Shool's Army, intolerant individuals bandied together to bully others into submitting to their bigoted beliefs.For those not versed in the caste system, this film may give you an idea what it's about as it laments about the state of current affairs, and how there's so much room for improvement in terms of people's attitudes. Director Priyadarshan, whom I associate with comedies like Billu Barber and De Dana Dan, goes all serious and doesn't mince his words in Aakrosh's epilogue, as he crafts a somewhat bleak film with an ending that will raise some eyebrows, suggesting at times that you got to play fire with fire, and some of the techniques employed by the cops here may highlight certain (il)legal framework that many may not be familiar with for us outside India, but so long as it works (and a brilliant plan and execution I must add).The film works because of the great chemistry between the pairing of Aakshaye Khanna and Ajay Devgan as cops who have the potential to be the best of buddies, yet operating on different investigative philosophies that put them at loggerheads as well. They share some explosive charisma on screen that just chews up all the surrounding scenery, with magnetic qualities that help to tide through the less happening stages of the film, one of which I felt was overly long and probably unnecessary was the entire backstory song/dance routine for Ajay's Pratap and his one time lady love Geetha (Bipasha Basu), their relationship being a victim of caste hypocrisy. Despite being passed with an Adults only rating in India and suffering 2 cuts from a reported 30 planned by the censor board there, Aakrosh is still a hard hitting investigative thriller. While the trailer may suggest high octane action, these sequences are fairly limited in the film, with nothing that especially stands out to wow. There's a rooftop chase sequence with a fair bit of parkour, but it's more reminiscent of Hollywood's Bourne series which delivered the action scenes with a bit more of a refined flair, with this being a bit rough off the edges. However a ballsy story without mincing its themes make Aakrosh the winner here." 
" it is worth watching than those stupid funny love stories","An outstanding dark movie ever made on a social subject...nothing could be better than this....you must be wondering than why it is not that popular.....2 simple reasons...1--no publicity...2--a rural story which everybody will like but forgets soon or don't wanna discuss...if you wanna taste what the real rural Indian thinkig on 'love' is than do watch this flick and specially the chemistry between the two actors is worth watching. If you are a kind of men who has lived his/her childhood like 'gautam buddha' than you might get disturberd mentally...Mind you its a 'good' torture 4 'cool urban people' out there.It is based on 'honour killing'.So if you ever ever loved someone & just imagine if she would have been that girl on whom this story is based on then you would realize what it takes to love in 'rural India'..just feel it..the scene where the 3 guys are being murderded is worth watching.PERFORMANCE--Every Character---More than or upto 100%....9/10...i should have given it 10 but honestly i don't know why i'm giving it a 9" 
" A Hard Hitting Saga","Aakrosh boasts of a very good star-cast. But in the past we have seen many movies falter despite having a great star-cast. The reason (very obvious)----Lack of a good Story Line. Well, its this aspect in which Aakrosh takes the lead from others. In India, the movies are made around the Interval. Its often that a movie builds its mood up-to the interval and then takes pace. But Aakrosh takes just initial 5 minutes in building the mood and manages (with aplomb)in keeping it up. The story is gripping. The action sequences are top-notch. The songs are few and well placed. The background score is terrific and the performances are fantastic. Though there is an excess of violence but it goes with the feel of the movie.Overall, a good movie which should not be missed." 
" A take on honor killing. Nicely executed!!","Watch or Not?: Definitely watch it as there is hardly any such good movies in Bollywood. and of course there is Ajay Devgan + Paresh Rawal.As it happens, whenever you first hear about how great a movie is and then go n watch the movie, it just doesn't stands up to the expectation you have built it for the movie in your minds. However, being a Priyadarshan(Director) movie( who excels in comedy movies), my expectations weren't sky high. The film plot has great scope for an enthralling venture and thats why the movie is enjoyable supported by Ajay Devgan experience of acting in such social-oriented-plot movies. Watching him always makes you forget u have popcorn to eat. He simply captures your attention.The story is about murder of 3 teenagers in a village n how a CBI officer(Akshay Khanna) and an Army officer(Ajay Devgan) goes about to solve it.The best part of the movie is Paresh Rawal, acting as a shrewd local Police Officer. With the ease he portrays the villain character, reminds you of his villain roles in 90s." 
" May find shades of Mississippi burning but a very effective thriller showing the caste brutality existing in today's time.","Three friends from Delhi go missing in a small village – Jhanjhar. It's two months and there is no clue about their disappearance. The media and students movement demand action from the authorities. It's then that the government orders a Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry with officers Sidhant Chaturvedi (Akshaye Khanna) and Pratap Kumar (Ajay Devgn) to solve the case. They find it difficult to solve the case as the local police and other authorities are a part of Shool Sena aka Home Minister which is responsible for illicit activities. Sidhant and Pratap also face Superintendent of police Ajatshatru Singh IPS (Paresh Rawal), a ruthless police officer who misuses his power. Not only that even the locals don't support the investigation." 
" a good hard hitting movie which is quite suspenseful and hardcore.","AAKROSH – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Aakrsoh is really hard core and hard hitting movie, it's dark and captivating. The movie presents the right cover up stories behind the honor killings. Aakrosh, most of the times become heavy and dramatic. Still it's a great attempt by Priya Darshan. Ajay Devgan again proves why people love him both in comedy and hard hitting cinema. He again brought a great social subject with utmost decency to on screen. Akshaye khanna, well I don't like his shouting in every other sequence, he seems like doing the same shouting in comedy, action or dramatic movies. Bipasha Basu is first rate and amazing as Paresh Rawal's victim wife. She really excels in every movie from comedy to hardcore cinema. Reema Sen is first class, for a single second she didn't look like a heroine she was so much in her character and whatever happened to Bipasha Basu and Reema Sen was pretty horrible in the movie. Paresh Rawal is outstanding, he is the king of comedies and villains too, another great performance by Mr.Paresh Rawal. Sameera Reddy's Hot item song was really fun to watch. Overall, a good hard hitting movie which is quite suspenseful and hardcore." 
" Priyadarshan can make serious movies as well","ever since i have seen Hera Pheri, Hungama, Hulchul, Bhool Bhulaiya, Garam Masala, Mere Baap Pehle Aap, Billu Barber, Bhagam Bhaag, De Dhana Dhan, and Yeh Tera Ghar Yeh Mera Ghar. I had believed in his movies to be funny moreover than serious.. but with Aakrosh he reminds us the time of Viraasat again. the story is about three students who were missing from more than two months and and two CBI officer Ajay Devgan and Akshaye Khanna's struggle to find evidence and get culprits to court for punishment. its for you to find out by watching what they go through and whether they succeed or not. I liked this movie for various reason, and top of the reason would be that most of the characters were done justice by getting the right actors to them and thats why they were portrayed well. Paresh Rawal is must watch in this film along with Bipasha Basu who doesn't get much scope. but she made every second she played worth praising for. the original success of this film will be when India gets triumph on honour killing.. then the attempt of making this film will be real victory. in sort, its a must watch." 
" Excellent job done!","This is my first ever review at any other website. I had gone to see this movie just for the sake of going with my friends. But this actually turned out to be one of the best of my seen movies. If you like thrillers, i think this one is the best option you have in 2010. It one of those movies which one never minds to see the whole again. The action in this movie is quite realistic. The movie entertains through out its course. Trust me you will never be getting bored in any of its parts. It is one of the movies where u actually get the after good effect. After watching this movie you will actually become a big fan of three main actors. So don't just read this review but actually go and watch this movie. The reason why i gave 9 and wrote excellent was because I m still waiting for some more perfection. That's all from me, so just go out and watch it in the theaters." 
" Aakrosh - Anger within","Priyadarshan finally decided to make a movie based on serious issues after a series of comedy stuff. The last I remember was Virasat and before it Gardish. Now both of them were well made movies but not to forget that they were remake of South Indian movies.This would be the first time he comes with a serious and original script. The movie is based on the recent hyped honour killings in India. An honour killing is a killing of young ones who despite of belonging to different castes, fall in love with each other. Not that honour killing weren't happening earlier but Priyadarshan took the right opportunity to make a movie on this subject due to lots of media news on it.The movie is a work of fiction with the background being disappearance of three young boys in a remote village named Jhanjhar. Enter our two CBI officers Sidhant (Akshaye) and Pratap (Ajay) who are given the task by the central government to find the whereabouts of the three missing ones. What starts from here is the mystery behind their disappearance, the corrupt acts of the local policemen (Paresh Rawal as the SP), the violent acts of one Shool Sena, the silence of villagers despite of multiple atrocities, the frustration of the two protagonists on being within the law despite of the fact that everyone else around is lawless and despite of all their efforts the criminals set free by the court. All this leads to anguish(Aakrosh) in both of them.What Priyadarshan misses is demarcation in making this movie serious or entertaining. Recently we had one serious movie on the pitiful state of farmers who cannot payback the loan they owe (Peepli Live). On the other hand there was a recent entertaining stuff on the background of a village with a Robinhood type cop (Dabangg). Aakrosh goes one way or the other in its whole run. There are authentic talks and brainy investigation by the two officers but then there are also unnecessary song sequences, romantic moments and unbelievable stunts.As a package though, the movie is not bad. Viewers will be glued to their seats due to the thrill and tensed theme of the movie. At times the direction of the movie picks up but loses momentum later on. This goes on till end. The script is good if not brilliant and at the end you have a satisfied feel. Performance wise, the cop duo chemistry between Ajay and Akshaye is excellent and the biggest turn on of the movie. Ajay takes most of the canvas and in his ruthless and gutsy role, performs very well. Akshaye also plays superbly his role as the tactful and strategist cop. Paresh Rawal is good but his character development as a comical and villainous SP of the village is improper given the fact that earlier he has played this kind of role very well(e.g. Milan, Mohra). The actresses are just shown as depleted woman of the society but they play their part as what supposed to be.Not in terms of a serious view but to watch an decent action flick this movie can be seen." 
" Realistic Movie, Must see for all","After Gangaajal(2003) a lot water has passed in River Ganges. Haven't seen such a good, realistic Hindi movie for a long time. This is a movie I will recommend as a MUST SEE for all Indians and stand united against Honour Killing & racism. Hats off to Priyadarshan for making such a serious movie besides making comedy movies.Storyline: Two CBI officers struggling to investigate about 3 missing medical students against corrupt police officials and local politicians. But finds out more than that, Crew: Ajay Devgan, Paresh Rawal, Akshaye Khanna did their best. Reema Sen worked better than Bipasha. But both the bongs played it hard.Guidelines: Parental Guidelines required if you are bringing kids. Enjoy the movie in theater & Stop Piracy." 
" Incredible Thriller","The action is just amazing, specially with Ajay Devgan on the top of the van. Priyadarshan, is one heck of a director. Then we have these scum imbeciles who have made the movies like "Three Idiots" and "Dabaang" who should learn from directors like him. This movie is worth every penny for the action sequence alone. Paresh Rawal, who is versatile as a stage, screen actor is never a let down. The photography is breathtaking-most of the scenes done by hand camera. Compared to these non Indian actors like Aamir Khan (this rodent midget cant act)and Salman Khan there is so much talent in the Indian Actors like Khanna, Devegun and Rawal. Rawal is such a good actor he can be funny even when is getting beat up!" 
" Average Fare...","A remake of the 1988 Hollywood Classic 'Mississippi Burning', 'Aakrosh' is an average fare, that hardly offers any novelty to those who have seen the original academy-award nominated film. Priyadarshan loves to remake stuff, but over-here, he fails to make an out-and-out, nail-biting gripping thriller.The problem with 'Aakrosh', is it's writing. Despite picking up an outstanding film as it's wallpaper, this violent film lacks a solid screenplay. Also, the screenplay focuses on a distressing subject like Honour Killings, but the impact of tackling such a serious issue also comes out half-baked.However, the Stunts are good and so is Priyadarshan's direction. The adapted Screenplay has it's moments, but eventually fails to leave the desired impact. Cinematography is passable, while the Songs and the Background Score deserve a mention.Acting wise, Ajay Devgn and Akshaye Khanna are efficient, as always. Bipasha Basu is alright. Reema Sen is very sincere. But 'Aakrosh' actually belongs to Paresh Rawal. The legendary actor is mind-blowing as a conning cop, and causes hatred each time he appears on screen.On the whole, 'Aakrosh' is, at best, an average fare that fails to become a killer remake. Watch if you must!" 
" A scene-by-scene copy of Mississipi Burning","Last night, I watched Mississipi Burning (1988) and was taken by surprise. It was really a shock to see how every bit of the movie has been copied by Priyadarshan. When I say 'copy', I mean it. Akrosh has nothing original to offer. Mississipi becomes UP/Bihar and racist killing takes the shape of honor killing. Rest remains same: the setting, the place the detectives stay, the place where killings happen, so on and so forth. Ajay Devgan plays a perfect Gene Hackman and does justice to the role. Akshaye Khanna plays a Defoe, the second lead. Can you believe it he appears in the same get-up as Dafoe in Mississipi...? Paresh Rawal's part has been a little spiced up to cater to the taste of Indian audience.Mississipi burning maintains the pace and never goes off-track, thanks to the director. Priyadarshan spoils the momentum by bringing in too-unrealistic and melodramatic fight sequences. Watch Mississipi Burning for a much better viewing experience. Aakrosh is an average remake...nothing more!" 
" Good stuff","Lets start off with the actors. First of all, Ajay Devgan and Akshaye Khanna were great; they both played the roles of no-nonsense, strong minded CBI officers very well. We're not used to seeing Paresh Rawal in such a role, but he also did very well. Bipasha Basu was also good and Reema Sen did well too in her role. The story itself is good; it keeps you hooked all the way which makes it a good thriller. Priyadarshan has done a good job. There's nothing special about the music, though the track 'isaq se meetha' is alright.Verdict: Watch it; you'll be kept at the edge of your seat for most of the film. I give it 8/10" 
" Good Attempt - But could have been better","When you sit to watch a movie about 3 abducted students in rural Bihar, you tend to have some expectations. Expectations that have been met (rather exceeded) by some genius directors like Vishal Bharadwaj (Omkara), Prakash Jha (Gangaajal, Apharan), etc. I wont say that Priyadarshan did a shabby job, but somewhere you do not end up coming out of the theater satisfied that you watched a masterpiece. Two things were very good in the movie - 1. The star cast... Ajay Devgan, Akshaye Khanna and Paresh Rawal in pivotal roles. 2. The setup/plot combination... the plot of age-old harassment in rural Bihar. So this gives the movie a very good platform to build upon. The movie starts with three medical students going untraceable in a village and CBI is in to solve the case. It appoints its two officers - Ajay and Akshaye to investigate the case. As they start digging in to the details, they come to know about the other related (and deep-rooted) problems in the village. How they solve the problems and unearth the mystery is all what the movie is about.Now for Priyadarshan trademark - what are the things flicked (oops... inspired) from other movies. (1) The movie is "inspired" from the 1987 Hollywood flick - Mississippi Burning. (2) The chase sequence when Ajay Devgan chases a crook called Nasbandi is flicked from Casino Royale. On the whole, its a nice movie. But I personally did not like the climax much. I would not like to discuss about the climax but I felt if it had been somewhat different, it would have been better."
