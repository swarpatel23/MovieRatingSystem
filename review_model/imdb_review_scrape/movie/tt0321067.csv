" I loved this movie! Come on... I watched it about 4 times this week","First of all, I have a hard time believing Ab Ke Baras was even considered a flop. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and believe me when I say this, I'm hardly ever impressed by movies. I was engrossed with Ab Ke Baras from the beginning. So what if the movie wasn't all that promoted, or that the main actors are fairly new to the screen, or even that some scenes could have been left out. I don't think these things even came close to outweighing the good qualities this movie contained. What really got me was the passion in which the actors brought out the characters. It's such an innocent movie. If I was to watch the first five minutes and the last five minutes, I wouldn't have known the two scenes were connected. I liked the fact that I never knew where the movie would go (in a good way, not that it was hard to follow). Isn't that an element of a good, thought out, creative movie? I believe so. One thing that might discourage people from watching this movie is that it's nearly, or actually I think it's a little over, 3 hours long. But again, unless you have somewhere to go or something else to be doing, it's well worth your time if you are a person looking for a real feel good movie. I will say this though, if you're a person who loves to watch the latest modernized "love triangle" type movies, you might not appreciate Ab Ke Baras the way I did. It's the little things that got me. Ab Ke Baras... go and watch it!"
