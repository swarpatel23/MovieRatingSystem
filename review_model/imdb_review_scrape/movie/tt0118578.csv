" Delayed and decayed","Post 2000 Govinda's bad phase started, his films started flopping though few worked. When Albela was announced people were shocked seeing the promos, cause it cast Govinda and Aish, but little did people know it is a delayed film started in 1995-1996 When Govinda was at his peak while Aishwarya was just joining bollywood. For reasons unknown the film was in making for many years, It's very odd to see Jackie Shroff(A lead of 90s films) paired opposite Aishwarya. The film looks very good though, it's production values are high but the script is non-existent. There are so many loopholes evident, like Aishwarya is supposed to search mother's grave but in the first half she just enjoys the company of tour guide Tony, Tony has such a huge bungalow in a small town Malaga(supposed to be Goa). Lot more to be narrated, Jackie Shroff and Aishwarya's love angle looks dull while the reasons they separate look outdated The worst joke is Saeed Jaffrey's change of heart.Direction by Deepak Sareen is not good, The film started in between Aaina(1993) and JPKSH which were far better products Music by Jatin Lalit is good, The film had several melidious songs rare for Govinda films, Sar se by Babul Supriyo, Alka is good, while Haiya Hun is fun number, Kaho to Zara is good too but the songs come too quick.Govinda is inconsistent, considering he signed the film in 90s, his acting too shows difference, At many places he is the loud Govinda of 90s while in some he does show signs of the Govinda he became later He is however too overweight Aishwarya is plastic in most scenes, her looks too are inconsistent Jackie Shroff is given a side role and hardly convinces Namrata Shirodkar too gets no scope, Saeed Jaffrey hams rest are okay." 
" Govinda rules","I don't understand some people. If Govinda stars in his "Govinda Comedy's"they say Govinda does the same rle over and over again (nobody says that Shah Rukh does the same thing which he HAS been doing ever since Dilwale Dulhan ia lejayenge -double standards anyone??). But when Govinda tries to do something different like in Chhote Sarkar (Divya Dutta, Shilpa Shirodkar and Kadar Khan(, Shikari (Tabu and Kareena Kapoor) or this Albela co starring Aishwariya Bachchan and Jackie Schroff with Namrata Shirodkar, everyone strats crying! Such double standards. At least Govinda is trying in contrast to Shah Rukh who is either Raj or Rahul in all his crap movies. The story of the film is different (actually a little based on Roman Holiday (Audrey hepburn and Gragory peck) which was already done in Tabu's first released movie Pehla Pehla Pyar starring Rishi Kaoor. Only this time the story is more Indianised. The songs are above average. Govinda gives a damn good performance. Jackie is just about okay. Aishwariya is nice but Namrata steals the show from Aishwariya. Okay, she's not as good looking as her sister Shilpa but she can act. Though must say Govinda and Shilpa were much better together in Aankhen, Hum and the forgettable third flick which name i forgot. Still worth a watch" 
" Zzzzzzzz, huh? what? Is the film over?","What a terrible film! Is Govinda on his last legs, cashing in on his name before gracelessly and flabbily retiring? Its the only way to explain his sudden explosion of appearances in more than a handful of recent releases in such a short space of time.The story is pathetic. However, usually Govinda can turn it around with his brand of humour. Unfortunately, there is none evident in this film and I couldn't even force myself to smile at any of his half-hearted attempts, and I love this guy. Aishwary appears in yet another of her trademark flop films only filling the screen with eye candy with her short dresses and bikinis.Saeed Jaffrey's 'Austrian' accent had to be the worst part of the film. Why? Why try to speak with an 'Austrian' accent when it sounded nothing like Austrian? It was clearly German. Somebody should have told the producers Austrians don't say 'Vein Holt!'. That's a German phrase!Songs weren't great, but are listenable if in the mood. The Albela title song is OK.All in all I gave this film a 2 out of 10 for the background scenaries and Aishwary's short dresses and bikinis :-)" 
" Not Stellar, but Still Fun","Wealthy Sonia (Aishwarya Rai) hires tour guide Tony (Govinda) to help her find her mother's grave. He is instantly smitten with her, but knows that she is out of his reach. Tony's best friend and neighbor, Neena (Namrata Shirodkar), has been in love with him for some time, but has never been bold enough to let him know. Sonia, too, has an unhappy romance behind her, with Prem (Jackie Shroff), of whom her father (Saeed Jaffrey) disapproves. How can all three of these love stories have a happy ending?Govinda is cute and charming as ever, giving a good humorous performance. Rai is not fully convincing, and she and Shroff do not have much chemistry. Shirodkar, however, is believable, and she and Govinda work well with each other. The music is average, with the choreography below average. The plot of this film, while predictable, is enjoyable and entertaining. This isn't a stellar movie, but it is fun to watch, especially for Govinda fans." 
" Pathetic","There are many reasons not to watch the movie or purely watch it for guilty pleasure. Here are some of the reasons: 1) Govinda and Aishwary's acting is just horrible. Aish's role in half the movie is just giggling in nonsensical jokes by Govinda. Govinda has some weird lingo which is neither Mumbai's nor Goa's. 2) Govinda and Aish cannot be paired! 3) They have Titanic (My heart will go on) in the background each time they show Aish in the frame. Well, not exactly, but almost the same tune. 4) Poor script - which Austrian girl, seemingly from a decent family would just get this cozy with a guide? 5) The crew sucks! I suggest you give it a miss unless you are a die hard fan of either. Also, I fail to understand who wrote such a pathetic script? There is just no flow in the movie?" 
" I guess it's every actress's dream to say the once worked with Govinda!","That's the only reason why I can rationalize why Aishwarya Rai would have chosen to star in this film. If she had done this earlier on in her acting career, it would have been understandable that she was trying to open doors for herself, but this film was in 2001! Come on Aishu! why? why? why? I have selected the "Non-spoiler" button so I will not say anymore. All I can do is warn you to see this film, only if you are a die-hard fan of Aishwarya or Govinda. A quick synopsis: Aishwarya plays a rich kid who goes on holiday somewhere in Asia or Europe(I can't remember where exactly), and Govinda plays a "happy go lucky" Albela(tour guide) she meets there."
