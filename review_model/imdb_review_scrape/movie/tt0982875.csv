" If it weren't for Rituparna and Atul, I would call this a B-grade film","'Gauri: The Unborn' is one messy flick. What drew me to watch this film was Rituparna Sengupta and Atul Kulkarni. The two seasoned actors are known for their very good acting and films. However, they are at their most inconsistent here. Both actors overact in many scenes and are just alright in a few, though Rituparna has her moments. Anupam Kher is alright and the child actors are pretty bad (blame the director for this). The screenplay does not impress at all nor does the script convince. The execution is very poor. There are silly 'jump' sequence wannabes that are supposed to be scary, many plot holes and unnecessary scenes. The songs are unnecessary and forgettable.Special effects look tacky. Cinematography is okay. Obviously, this is an anti-abortion film but the subject is handled in the most immature way and clearly the writer feels very strongly against abortion. I'm not against the film because I support abortion but I would have preferred to watch a film that shows both sides of an issue. However, there's just a lot more wrong with this film." 
" Not worth","This film can be watched if you've got nothing better to see and simply want to watch some horror film. It features Atul Kulkarni,who is otherwise a good actor(Khakee,Rang de basanti)in one of his worst roles. The film is Too silly,Not really scary,has unwanted scenes. There's overacting in plenty. Of course it focuses on female infanticide but was it meant to be a horror to scare people or a social film to educate people on such matters? And like many Indian horrors,I think this too features ideas from the west.Now why do people copy the west to scare an Indian audience??Horrors like Phoonk are more authentic and really scary. Hence Not Worth." 
" A film, which adds a completely new perspective towards the problem of girl foeticide in the country.","First of all I would like to mention that this particular film has been added to the "Must See Movies" list here, solely on the basis of its novel story plot which has its own importance and power to change the sick mindsets of families who are only interested in having a boy child from their daughters-in-law.The film belongs to the HORROR genre and is strictly okay as far as its direction, performances, music and execution is concerned. There are no worth watching special effects nor any great shocking scenes in its narration. But if we look into the hidden potential present in its fresh story idea, then the movie possibly can be used as an important tool against a burning problem in the country dealing with the merciless killing of the girl child before her birth.Just think of a case where a husband and wife decide to abort their girl child due to their willingness to have a boy instead. Now years later when they do have a boy child, out of a sudden, a spirit starts haunting the kid and the whole family in some peculiar ways which remind the parent couple of their ugly past. Actually it's the spirit of that unborn girl child who has now returned only to make her parents realize their mistake of killing her while she was still developing in her mother's womb. She makes their life miserable and returns only after they ask for her mercy and realize their inhuman mistake from their heart.Now, I agree that this may strengthen superstition, but when all other means have failed to stop this evil practice in our society, then why shouldn't we try this brilliant idea to scare all those devils who want to kill their daughters' right in the wombs. At least this thought will frighten them of having an insecure future and they would not dare to take this step thinking about its scary consequences.Though in the present movie, the couple aborts the girl child due to their career prospects but nevertheless it clearly gives out an ultimatum to anyone watching that if they also ever took this kind of deliberate decision in their life, then they should be ready to face the trauma as suffered by the couple in the film."Gauri – the Unborn" is also recommended for its final 15 minutes, when the spirit of the unborn girl questions her parents that what was her mistake and then explains her pain of not being given a chance to live. While moving away she asks them for their permission to let her come to meet them whenever she needs their love. The scene is capable of transforming even the coldest heart and will right away bring tears to every male or female watching the movie.And for the viewers, who would like to argue that how's this possible, the answer is given by Anupam Kher, who acts as the grandfather of the child in the film. In his words, "If Abhimanyu can listen & learn, the art of entering the Chakravyuh while he was still in his mother's womb then why can't the girl child hear all about your plans of brutally killing her right from the inside".Do watch and recommend it to all your friends, if you like and support the idea of using the movie against this social evil of our society." 
" A one-time watch...","I am not sure what movie(s) is this one copied from, but I must say that Bollywood has come a long way in its technical aspects and endeavors. The movie is not bad for a one-time watch. I would not recommend repeat watching since it's not designed for repeat audiences. It's a horror story with a message of anti-abortion. The script is quite poorly written but the characters manage to bring out the best of it through their acting.The child artiste should have been replaced though. She didn't impress me much. Besides that, the cinematography is also poor. All in all, I would give this movie a rating of 6 on a 10-point scale. Don't ignore the movie, because that's not the point. The point is, it's not bad for a lazy evening with some friends, popcorn, chips, nuts and drinks."
