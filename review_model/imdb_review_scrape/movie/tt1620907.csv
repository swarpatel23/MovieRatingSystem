" Abosolute Comedy !","Clean, Straight and a never seen kind of movie. A true comedy at its best! Every scene is so realistic and reminds of old school kinda movies. Leaves you laughing; thinking about the movie after the end. The star-cast is marvelous; excellent editing and a decent comedy that a family can sit together and have a fun time around.The movie starts with a usual introduction of a typical Indian Village and the people living in it by Devaki Nandan Thripati - the main character of the movie; The comedy is a non-routine and non-typical story where a Devaki Nandan Thripati's experiences moving to Bombay for his first Job are extrapolated in his day to day life. Comedy is interwoven at every step, every dialogue and every scene. Its just so natural in the story, with every character contributing at their own level and the dialogues, the typical village style slang has made it further more interesting.Om Puri, Paresh Raval & Nina Gupta - all the veteran actors have topped the respective roles as usual and have delivered an excellent performance in every aspect. Delivered an excellent performance at every moment, living the character to the fullest, despite his debut.A must watch for all comedy liking folks out there." 
" An Enjoyable Comedy!","Rahul Aggarwal's under-rated 'Na Ghar Ke Na Ghaat Ke' is An Enjoyable Comedy! It catches you by surprise & entertains, at most parts.'Na Ghar Ke Na Ghaat Ke' Synopsis: A naive villager faces challenges when he gets a job in a big city.'Na Ghar Ke Na Ghaat Ke' begins tepidly but gains momentum as soon as the protagonist comes to the big city. However, the second-hour is monotonous. The series of events do hold appeal, but some innovation definitely would've been more impressive. The Screenplay is sweet & simple. but succumbs to monotony in the final-hour. Rahul's Direction is decent. Performance-Wise: Rahul suits the part. He's every bit of the common man & portrays the part with sincerity. Narayani Shastri is subtle. Ravi Kishan is fantastic. He enacts the loud character with amazing ease. Neena Gupta & Om Puri are excellent. Paresh Rawal towers above all with a flawless performance. On the whole, 'Na Ghar Ke Na Ghaat Ke' is much better than expected." 
" Ode to Hrishida/ Basu Chatterjee","Well to start with, let me state that the title of the movie has no relevance to the plot whatsoever. Its completely misleading.Performances::In terms of performance Rahul Agarwal (actor/director), gets into the skin of the character. The delivery and accent will make you instantly connect with Devki Nandan Tripathi. Next in line is the performance of Om Puri who as usual is spot-on. He get a meaty role and delivers with utmost perfection. I haven't watched Narayani Shashtri on telly but did find her performance in the movie commendable. Anant Mahadevan was okay'ish. Item number by Shweta Salve was good. Coming to the other side of the coin. To start with Ravi Kissen makes over-the-top attempt to connive us with his acting skills as Madan Khachak. Falls flat. Neena Gupta comes across extremely artificial, just don't ask me why. Paresh Rawal presence is not justified in the movie. Neeraj Vora wasn't required. There are many good points about the movie. What I particularly liked is the feel of Hrishida and Basu Chatterjee touch in it. The common man, simplicity - if you know what I mean. "Main Meri Patni Aur Woh" was the last time I felt similar about it. The one-liners deserve a special mention as they have adequate dose of clean humour. Substantial characters are introduced into the plot, sadly they do not fleshed out adequately (or maybe got chopped on the editing table). Cinematorgraphy is good. The authentic feel of the village deserves a special mention. The songs are pleasant. Remo's title track lingers on for a while. And lastly the direction is extremely good, considering that its wielded by a first-timer. Has enough potential to mature into continuing the lineage of Hrishida and Basu Chatterjee genre of movies." 
" Neither Inside Nor Outside","Rahul Aggarwal directs and acts in one of the year's most refreshing comedies. 'Na Ghar Ke Na Ghaat Ke' is a celebration of old school Bollywood movies, a celebration of the cultural diversity in India, and a celebration of the common family. Rarely has culture clash been depicted so realistically yet with a sharp humour (in this case the clash is between a Bihari villager and a Bombayan city slicker). The linguistic and traditional barriers have been hilariously depicted here. The movie does have a message and even though at some point the delivery of it is done with an in your face approach, the comedy makes up for that.Om Puri and Neena Kulkarni are excellent as the proud Bihari couple. Ravi Kishan is hilarious as the Bombayan slicker while Paresh Rawal is in his usual element (that's not a bad thing in this case). Rahul Aggarwal and Narayani Shastri share great chemistry and are a convincing pair on screen. They hold their own against theit more experienced costars.'Na Ghar Ke Na Ghaat Ke' is a sincere little film and it's pleasing to see that there still are filmmakers today in India making movies about life in India. Aggarwal's film is refreshing, sincere and funny as hell." 
" Good movie from a first time actor !!","When this movie began, I thought I would get bored for the next 2+ hours but sincerely, I didn't expect this movie to be so freakin' good !!. First of all I would like to congratulate Rahul Aggarwal. I wish new upcoming actors learn from him because he was exceptional in the movie. Other supporting actors such as Paresh Rawal, Om Puri and Ravi Kishan also performed well and Narayani Shastri did make a good debut into the big screen. The best thing about Rahul was that his facial expression remained very much the same throughout the movie. He did not try to over do it like the current batch of actors we have today. Alok Upadhyay should also be congratulated for writing this movie. It was hilarious from the start to the finish and there was minimum overacting by the supporting cast. Shweta Salve's item number was pretty good as well and Om Puri and Paresh Rawal were pretty hilarious at times. Ravi Kishan continues to show us why he is one of the better actor in India and overall all I can say is this movie should do pretty well at the box office. I'll give this movie a 9/10 (bollywood standard) for lifting the standard of comedy in Bollywood." 
" Best from a Debut Director and Actor","It's a legendary movie full of comedy and realistic scenes. A big shout out to the Director. It's a complete picture of what an ordinary villager would go through in his first time visit to a big city like mumbai. Mr Madan Khachak has been the favourite character throughout the movie. These types of comedy movies are being missed a great time in this era." 
" A simple movie with a good story","My Wife and I were recently looking for movies we have not seen before and by chance came across this one. From the beginning you're taken by the lead character played wonderfully by Rahul Aggarwal into the lives of folk in India from those villages that aren't so well known. It has comedy timing which has been seriously lacking (speaking 7 years on from this movie). A fluent film well scripted and well cast. Each actor plays their role to perfection. A mix of new and experienced cast members with the likes of Paresh Rawal, Om Puri and Ravi Kishan having some incredible comedy moments. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys simple none over the top comedies." 
" Simple awesome","Great script. Great direction. Unknown lead character but really does his part with conviction. Old timers and experienced actors in Paresh Rawal, Om Puri and Ravi Kishen once again live up to their expectation. Actually there is nothing that is to mention about that's what make this film so special. Smooth sailing story about a villager finding it tough to adjust the fast life of Mumbai. But awesome timing. The item song actually adds a special touch, including the other songs I would say the movie pays a tribute the simply bollywood style. Recently we have seen quite a few movie which tries to undermine the bollywood style of song sequences, but why do that when you can merge smartness with epiphany. Well everything was so good that I was tempted to give it full marks, but the ending could have been improved in my view. A little more witty climax would served the purpose well.Last but not the least its a story resembling circular endings, and their circular stories, are often the shape that quest-adventure stories take on. The main character sets out on a quest to find or learn or accomplish something, passes through trials, and finally succeeds in his mission and returns home with his prize to share (often insight or wisdom). Ultimately, the protagonist grows/changes/achieves then brings that wealth back home to alter his preexisting everyday life. Full circle. Beginning and end mirror and contrast one another.And here becomes a saheri babu (:P)"
