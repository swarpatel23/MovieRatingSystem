" not an out n out Priyan comedy","if you are going in with preset mind of watching a Priyadarshan comedy then you might not appreciate the film. the performances are good. Om Puri stands out. Akshaye and Paresh are good and share a nice chemistry in father and son relationship. Jeneliya has looked cute and justice to her character( though there was not much for her to do)if one goes for it with open mind without any presets then he/she would love the flick.i would recommend do go for it at least once, as there are not many in Hindi cinema which shows father and son relationship and that too in this beautiful manner." 
" A Good and Decent Movie With Some Good Comedy","Having watched a lot of promos of this movie, I must say that I was not disappointed. A movie by Priyadarshan means that it would have some good comedy side to it and what more when one has Akshaye Khanna and Paresh Rawal.Janardhan Wishvandhar is a widower who seems to have spent his life bringing up two children, Chirag and Gauarav. The latter is the one who decides to take care of his father and looks after him in such a way that at times he has to bail him out of prison for stripping in a Police station with his notorious friend, Madhav, to shouting at him and at times locking him up. Chirag in the meantime is totally henpecked husband. This all goes on until a girl decides to play pranks on Gaurav and Janardhan meets an ex - flame.The movie stars Akshaye Khanna, Paresh Rawal, Om Puri, Genelia DeSouza and Rajpal Yadav, Manoj Joshi and Naseerudin Shah in a special appearance and is directed by Priyadarshan.This is perhaps one of the best movies that have been released this year - it has both comedy and emotional drama which at times is rare to find in a movie these days. Akshaye Khanna as usual is good as are Paresh Rawal and Om Puri as well as Genelia DeSouza. A couple of tunes are also decent to listen to (which makes a change) Conclusion: A film well worth watching." 
" A good family entertaining movie","This Movie is an typical priyadarshan movie with his favorite stars Paresh rawal, Om Puri, Akshay Khanna and rajpal yadav. Comedy is really very good in movie, and it also shows great father son relationship. This is a complete family movie which you can enjoy with your whole family, though the music is not such good, but I am sure you are gonna enjoying this movie. About actors part, Akshay again did his best and Paresh shows his great talent in emotion here, Om Puri is funny, Genelia rocks in her role, Rajpal yadav and Archana Puransingh was good in their part but was hardly there. The movie was an average one from earning point of view, but if you are looking for a goof family movie, then its a must watch. I will rate this 6/10. Today Priyadarshan is the only Director/ Producer who is making complete family entertainment and comedy movies." 
" Awesome","Once again a great movie from Priyadarshan ! Cheers ! Comedy in Indian movies have truly matured its really heartening to note that such entertaining movies are "Made in India".For an out of the world entertaining experience just go and watch the movie. Paresh Raval is great as always, Akshaye Khanna has carved a niche for himself and to see him in this movie as yet another entertainer is a delight. Other actors have also done their best. Good teamwork generally.The most refreshing experience is Genelia D'Souza, she's ultimate what a innocent, smiling look. She carries on her role all through the movie with great efficiency. She's the best. I watched the movie twice to see her again ! So for all this congrats to Priyadarshan and team and await more and more like this from them in coming years." 
" A refreshing treat from the comedy king....",""Mere Baap Pehle Aap"is a refreshing treat from the 'Comedy King' Priyadarshan.The film is a wonderful combination of hilarious events and emotional play.It is about sweet relationship between a father and his son,but unlike the familiar ones this one is the other way round. Gaurav(Akshaye Khanna) rules over his father Janardhan Wishvambhar Rane(Paresh Rawal) advising him with "dos and don-ts"and also decides the latter's course of life .He even chides him whenever Rane does any mistake like a small kid.Madhav Mathur(Om Puri) is a pal of Rane who is badly in search of a bride and invites trouble wherever he goes.Story sails smoothly and is a fun ride with comic timings and witty dialog's from all the characters till the interval when Rane meets Anuradha(Shobhana)and his life takes a turn with long past memories rushing in.Sheekha(Genelia D'souza),an old friend of Gourav meets him after long time and along with him helps to unite the two,Anuradha and Rane and falling herself in love with Gaurav in the process.The second half changes into an emotional phase dealing with love,relations and sacrifice.The film solely revolves and focuses around Akshaye Khanna and Paresh Rawal who were outstanding with their performances.Their chemistry is superb as we had seen in films like Hulchul and Hungama.Rawal is subdued unlike his earlier forms and has fewer dialog's yet his role speak volumes.Akshaye Khanna continues to prove that he is a master at comedies.Ompuri in his new avatar as a go free person will be treat for the audience.Good old Rajpal Yadav is entertaining in the lone scene he appears.Shobhana is good but not up-to the mark.Genelia D'souza is the only weak link in the film lacking the punch in the dialog delivery and her charming smile couldn't overshadow her weak histrionics.Nasserudin Shah in his special appearance as Sheekha's father is perfect as ever in oscillating between a good and a shady character.Music director Vidyasagar is good at patches thanks to the rocking song "Isq Subhanallah" which has already become a hit.Priyardarshan needs a special mention who has done brilliant job blending comedy and emotions in the right proportion.This film is a not a total comedy flick but backed by good story and screenplay.The director needs kudos for his work.The film is better than many other big budget films released this year.The audience will just love it." 
" Worst Hindi movie of the year so far...","I bunked my class to see the movie with high expectations. But I was very disappointed. Priyadarshan has disappointed us again with this movie. Akshay Khanna is so-so. Paresh Rawal and Om Puri have been wasted in their roles. Genelia is a total bore. She yaps a lot during the entire movie. And there wasn't much screen space reserved for Rajpal Yadav. Songs are also bad. Storyline lacks a proper narration.Overall I can just give 1 star as there's no other rating below it . Priyadarshan owes me my Rs.100 and the 2 hours that I spent on this movie. Go watch Hera Pheri once again. You loved it then...you'll love it more now...!! I feel much better now. This movie sucks. Go watch Nepali movies. They're much better than this movie." 
" Death of a good comedy!","It was not exactly the total failure of Priyadarshan, but at least a part of it. We went to see it because the parts of this movie which is usually shown as a trailer in different channels in TV are hilarious and are definitely the best parts of it. Otherways, it is one of those flicks which runs for long without any reason and without any strong storyline behind it too. The movie started very well, continued till 1 hr and couple of minutes with Priyadarshan's true sense of creating a great humor flick, but suddenly it tried to get down from track and making a mess of it before the long waited "Intermission".In the second half, the story keeps on crawling with little space for humor in it, and that's where it fails. Certainly, then it felt like wasting too much for trivial things, not exactly related to the genre of the movie.We've also expected Rajpal Yadav to be given some more minutes in the movie who is definitely the best comedian/actor of the lot. Akshaye Khanna was good at his role, Genelia D'Souza looked very cute, Paresh Rawal and Om Puri were on their own to save the movie. Finally, I would say my 120 bucks were worth for this show out of 200.Lastly, as I said, this flick was a bit lengthy where more than once we expected it to finish early. But against all odds and failures, this movie did make us laugh 6 times out of every 10 times and hence my rating goes as 6/10." 
" Priyan gone down","There was a time post HERA PHERI(2000) when Priyan's name itself brought huge of audiences and the films worked Be it HUNGAMA, HULCHUL, GARAM MASALA, MALAAMAL WEEKLY though most were copies of south films yet there worked at the BO But off late his comedies are become dull with mostly the same jokes, same actors cast He has the same cast too he repeats This film is also a remake and has a thin story and the handling is so boringThe film leaves you bored with the loud gags which mostly fall flat and the drama which gets to the nervesDirection is ordinary Music is okayAmongst actors Akshaye with a bad wig frowns and screams tirelessly and is decent towards the end Paresh is getting repetitive now and Om Puri though has some moments is miscast Genelia's release just before JTYJN and she wasn't that good here Naseeruddin Shah is okay in a brief role, Shobana is okay Rajpal is wasted, Archana Puran Singh is loud" 
" Thirty minutes of comedy dissolved in a 157 minute film.","'Who says only young people can get married?'Janaradhan wants to get married again. His two sons try to keep him out of trouble, which he seems drawn to, especially when he is with his friend Madhav. The son Chirag is married with two children. The other son Gaurav does most of the caring for the elderly father.Madhav has been divorced for sometime, while Janaradhan is a widower. Madhav is more the prankster who gets them in trouble. Gaurav is usually the one to bail them out and face the attendant embarrassment.A young woman named Rose (well, Sheeka) keeps calling Gaurav, and acts like they used to know one another. Sheeka does not seem to know when to stop a practical joke; more to the point, the director does not. That and the father's hijinks move the film forward. Somewhat.Once the joke is stopped, events can move forward again. This is sixty minutes into the film, and I don't feel more informed than I did at three minutes in.After Janaradhan takes a spill and ends up in hospital with a broken leg, Gaurav and Sheeka take care of him. This appears to be their courtship as well. That is, until Janaradhan asks her about romantic possibilities. The problem is that she is more of an American now and he intends to stay in India.At the pre-wedding party for Sheeka's friend, Janaradhan recognizes Sheeka's teacher as his old flame. Madhav sets his hopes on her, but both Gaurav and Janaradhan think this is a rather bad idea. The day of the wedding, Sheeka introduces her teacher to Janaradhan, and it is clear that they know one another.Janaradhan cleans himself up, shaves, dyes his hair, and gets a haircut. He looks quite different. He goes to the college where his old flame works, but finds she's on leave. Things go down hill from there. He and Gaurav have a row about it later.Janaradhan gets more comfortable with his younger look. At a party it seems like a good opportunity to him and the old flame to get together.Will Sheeka go back to America? Will the old secrets be revealed? Will Janaradhan get what he looking for?------Scores------Cinematography: 10/10 Fine.Sound: 7/10 Good, but hollow now and then, usually on conversation, not singing.Acting: 5/10 Whereas Akshaye Khanna is a star, Paresh Rawal is a black-hole of lack. The absence of Rawal would have improved the film greatly. Om Puri was next to terrible to watch. The performance of Genelia D'Souza was enjoyable.Screenplay: 6/10 Too drawn out, too long, too much filler.Musical Numbers: 7/10 The first musical number accompanied the opening credits and was fine. The five numbers after that were quite nice.*****The mixed acting and bloated script are mostly balanced by the cinematography and the musical numbers." 
" Slow moving script","Priyadarshan's magic could not be found in this one. Not as hilarious as his previous ones were. Moreover, there were hardly any good jokes. Om Puri and Paresh Rawal were excellent and funny as usual. The first half was funny and all credits to the duo; but the latter half did the movie in. The Climax was poor. The locations and direction were upto the mark except for a slow moving script and needless songs. Akshay khanna was okay. Genelia D'souza, the actress we saw in Masti and some telugu movies was found to be hyper... don't know whether the role demanded such overacting or it was natural. Rajpal yadav in his short scene was very funny. Priyadarshan had unnecessary scenes, songs, etcetera and he was trying his level best to tie the scenes together. Overall, worth watching if someone offers the tickets or have no other things to do." 
" Huge waste of time","The movie is far too long, and with no real legs (plot) to stand on, it straddles your mind like a colossal headache. There should be a law to bar Genelia from 'acting'. The film is riddled with clichéd situations and the plot itself meanders from one dead end to another. Songs are passable at the best, irritating most of the times. Characters played by Rajpal Yadav, Shobana and Naseerudin are an insult to these talented actors.Dialogues are not as bad as the rest of the movie. In fact, at times they carry the movie forward. Akshay does a decent enough job, mainly due to his histrionic skills and direction from Priyadarshan. Only saving grace is Paresh Rawal. As the elderly dad and then as the 'young' lad, he brings out his range of skills.Is (was) this the death of Priyadarshan's comedy?" 
" Maaf Karde Mere Baap","It was the turn of the millennium, a well known director/producer from the south teamed up with a solid team of amateurs as well as some well established names and gave us perhaps one of the GREATEST QUIESSENTIALLY Indian COMEDY THIS SIDE OF THE 80S.And he never looked up again.The downhill journey started with the golden team of Neeraj Vora and Priyadarshan who raped one English movie after the other and claimed it to be their. AND THE CLUELESS Indian AUDIENCE WATCHED AND LAUGHED, AND ONCE AGAIN AFTER NEARLY 5 YEARS PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AT THE GOVINDA BRAND OF HUMOUR.Which was exactly a bad thing, i loved the a few of the original Govinda comedies (favourite being Deewane Mastane), and if had seen too many good English movies THAN I CAN TAKE A HIKE.But sooner than later the audience woke up to the loosely edited copy-paste jobs and the popularity of his movie began to wane.And yet people continued to be fooled and were drawn to the cinemas by stellar cast especially Akshay Kumar.But then he did the unthinkable, he dropped Akshay Kumar and that resulted in the culmination of all his past mistakes THIS.The movie has nothing going for it.The acting is merely OK with stellar performers like Paresh Rawal and Om Puri finally loosing out to a weak script, Akshay Kumar was merely good at his best and you can only imagine was a weak movie like this will do, GENELIA LOOKED SPARKLING BUT HER ACTING TALENT IS NOT QUITE UPTO THE MARK, the chemistry was non-existent between almost everybody, THE SPARK WAS MISSING COMPLETELY FROM THE FATHER SON DUO WHICH WAS MOST IMPORTANT.The music is quite bad and adds nothing to the movie, the to add insult to injury the songs are misplaced.Even though the concept had potential the script is weaker than most slapsticks, THE ENTIRE MATURE LOVE STORY WAS AS BAD AS HAVING UNDERCOOKED SEAFOOD (which i don't eat since I'm vegetarian).And then there is the humour itself which was humorous for all of 10 mins in the first half and 15 mins in the entire movies,LETS NOT MENTION THE PRESENCE OF RAJPAL YADAV (i just did hehe).AN In-depth ANALYSIS OF THE MOVIES SHORTCOMINGS WILL CLEARLY RUN INTO PAGES SO LETS GET THE TO GOOD PARTS AND THE CONCLUSION.Genelia looks fresh and enticing, even looks sexy in a few scenes, acting could improve though.Om Puri is actually funny in most scenes.Some scenes promise and almost deliver.Conclusion A MOVIE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DECENT DRAMA IF THERE WAS REALLY ANY. Definitely not a comedy, avoid unless your a super Genelia fan (ARE there are any?).-s no drama, no comedy, ordinary acting, bad songs, wasted potential.+/-s had potential??!!!.+s Genelia Dsouza, Om Puri, 15 mins of fun.total 4/10 (only because i expected very less, fell even below my low expectations, REALLY I HOPE THIS IS A WAKE UP CALL FOR PRIYADARSHAN WHO HAD ONCE PROMISED US THE WORLD)." 
" movie review","Priyadrashan + Paresh Rawal + Akshay Khanna..........u expect a gr8 time pass and some really funny lines as in the past movies like Hulchul, Hungama etc. But this time Priyan really fails to give a full time pass movie. Although there are some really funny moments (Om Puri as always at best), but those few moments does not make a watchable flick. Story is a typical boolywood masala one so i don't think , i need to write anything on that. About acting part, Akshay is dependable, Paresh goes overhead, Rajpal Yadav is a complete waste, Genzil D'silva, i was not expecting much from her so OK, Om Puri is best."
