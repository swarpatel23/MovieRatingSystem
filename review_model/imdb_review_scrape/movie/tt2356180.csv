" Farhan has done wonders","Few critics, few including Rediff ones whom I look for some good writing, have rated low to BMB. The reason they give is that movie lacks coherence and clarity. Really? I think they should only rate Hollywood movies because whoever thinks this movie is no good does not know what Hindi cinema is. Farhan has done an awesome job, and if I say awesome then it is not for his physique and dialogue delivery but for the transformation, he has gone to become Milkha Singh. We as an audience witness the physical stress and labor that an athlete as likes of Milkha Singh undergo to become a 'flying Sikh'. Hindi cinema celebrates the life of this living legend with songs and drama and music. Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra has done a decent job, still; I fell he could have done a lot better especially in the scenes of Milkha's childhood memories. His attempt of giving the movie an epic convention seriously affected the narrative portion. However, all this can be sided by the grandeur of Farhan's effort. I would like to mention a statement of one of the rediff users who wrote against critics who are undermining the effect of this movie: "note that 400mtrs is a very difficult race to run. it is at the border of quick races and long jogs. after partition India did not have either the experience nor the infra to produce runners for 400mtrs. So Milkha was a true champion in every sense. If critics pull films like these down for abstract reasonswe will forever have 20 goons flying in the air with one punch from one man. Grow up critics."So true." 
" "Bollywood needs a better class of directors, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is gonna give you that"","I know this film is criticized for being overlong, but there is not a moment where you will get bored. Based on the real life story of an awesome athlete "The Flying Sikh" Milkha Singh, the story solely revolves around the hardships and horrors of his life. The whole film in a sense, is perfect.Director: Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Now, i don't think i have to tell you about his past achievements. After delivering one of the greatest blockbuster of bollywood "Rang De Basanti", Mehra is back with a bang!!!!! Direction is superb with almost no loopholes left to be noticed.Scriptwriter: Prasoon Joshi This National Awardee (Taare Zameen Par) needs no introduction. Script of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has been beautifully transcribed and and more beautifully presented on the silver screen.Actor: Farhan Akhtar yes, this is solely a Farhan Akhtar movie. This multi talented person has put his heart and sole in the movie. His talent can only be judged by his dedication. Farhan Akhtar's talent has been put to justice. And Pavan Malhotra's role as Coach Gurudev Singh also fits.All in all, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a must watch for all movie lovers, sports lovers and Indian History lovers!!!!!" 
" Farhan Akhtar, an epitome of extreme dedication towards the character","I would certainly be disappointed if this movie doesn't get nominated for the best foreign language film in the academy awards. Farhan Akhtar is like the epitome of dedication towards Milkha Singh's character. He was running like a pro. Cinematography was just amazing. Many shots were just breathtaking. Direction was just perfect and the casting was sensibly done. Parallel storytelling kept the movie balanced between Milkha Singh's life and his sports career. The trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did their job as always. But one of all, Farhan Akhtar rocked. He has always given his best in every field he has ever stepped in to. Respect for Farhan Akhtar, respect for Milkha Singh, the true hero." 
" A commendable film on Milkha Singh's inspiring tale!","The sheer joy of watching someones hard-work come to life on the screen is inspiring indeed. To portray Milkha Singh's struggle and achievements and his zeal to succeed at the world stage, required an equally earnest and dedicated effort by the filmmakers. This effort is reflected in Bhag Milkha Bhag, and is what makes the film commendable.Farhan Akhtar's tough physical training for this role pays great dividends on screen. The races look pretty convincing because of Farhan's effort and soon you find yourself cheering for Milkha, if not loudly in the movie-hall then at-least in your head.The non-linear narrative of the film keeps the movie engrossing, so although you know the basic outline of the story, you can't really guess what would happen next. The story is narrated by Milkha's coach Gurudev Singh played brilliantly Pavan Malhotra by who first recognizes the Milkha Singh's talent.The women in Milkha Singh's life play a very important role, be it his elder sister (played by Divya Dutta)who single handedly brings Milkha up, or the love of his life (Sonam Kapoor) who is the reason why he changes his unruly ways. Although one must add, that the part where Milkha goes on a romp after a party with Stella(Rebecca Brooks) during the 1956 Melbourne Games does look a bit forced.Some people may have qualms with the dance sequences but personally they were quite enjoyable and didn't jar the narrative. Keep an eye out for the song with Sonam Kapoor who plays Milkha Singh's love interest in the film. The shot with them both on top of a bridge with green, swiftly flowing water below was captured beautifully.The director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has a signature style which is apparent like from his previous films- Rang De Basanti and Delhi-6. He can merge music and visuals to great effect. Although in some scenes a little bit of restraint in the stylistic details and drama could have certainly helped.To emerge as a world leading athlete from India just after independence, when I suppose sports facilities weren't great, with the scars of the partition deep in his mind is some achievement. We salute you Milkha Singh! One must commend the efforts of the filmmakers to bring the story to us." 
" Truly Inspiring... Bhaag Milkha!","BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is a biopic directed by Rakyesh Omprakash Mehra, starring Farhan Akthar and Sonam Kapoor.The film revolves around the life story of Milkha Singh.Everyone who is associated with this film has done a GREAT job. The directors... the writers... the actors... EVERYONE. When the first look of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag came, we were shocked how similar Farhan Akthar looked like Milkha Singh, and his acting has showed us that not only is he a GREAT actor, but he can mostly do any role by now. His portrayal of Milkha Singh was outstanding.The film starts off a BIT slow, but you manage to keep with its pace. Inspite of the film being 3h10m, you never feel bored; instead, you find yourself stuck in the world of Milkhaji- poverty, love and speed.The replay value of this film is very high. Its very entertaining.The acting, as said above, is very good. Other than Farhan Akthar delivering an award-winning performance, every other actor did a great job. Sonam Kapoor didn't have much to do in the screenplay, but she did it quite well.The film does depend on each person's likes and tastes. A person who enjoys watching the so-called 'masala' flicks, may not enjoy this film due to its different type of story compared to other films. Also, people who can't sit in cinemas for a VERY long time may get annoyed at the fact that its a 3h10m film.But Overall, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an award-winning film. It shows us the life of Milkha Singh through his very own eyes and deserves a standing ovation for its performances, writing and direction. Truly Inspiring...Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!- 10/10" 
" Farhan Akhter deserves a National award for this!!!","Well I was not excited enough for this movie, but when the trailers started coming and then the music, my curiosity began to flourish little bit. But the main reason I went to saw this movie was because I heard almost 50-60 review from my friends and not even single person had a negative review against it. And when I saw this, it really blew me away because it had many mixtures which made this movie work. First of all FARHAN AKHTER is at its best, no doubt its his best performance till date. It was like we were seeing real Milkha Singh on screen. Divya Dutta is awesome, Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh & Prakash Raj have really performed well. Sonam Kapoor is completely waste though her role was very little, so you won't miss her. Rebecca Breeds looks fabulous, Dilip Tahil as Jawahar Lal Nehru was not a master stroke. Screenplay was good, music was fabulous and the background score really kept the life in each and every scene. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's best work till date also. YOU DARE TO MISS THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN RISK !!!" 
" Heroism, dedication and roar of an Indian wounded Lion....Bhaag Milkha Bhaag","If Milkha Singh is a "Hero" this movie is Heroic! This Biopic have been excellently crafted by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, nicely scripted by Prasoon Joshi, storytelling is nice and sequence of events have been placed aptly. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it makes you feel empathetic for Milkha, his partition affected fellows and communities. Right from the word 'go' till finish this flick will keep you glued to your seats. Brilliantly performed by Farhan Akhtar along with other co-stars, with a special mention for Pavan Malhotra (Gurudev Singh, Milkha's initial trainer & coach). Full marks to Farhan for his efforts, acting, dedication for the role, for getting completely into the skin of Milkha Singh and for being an authentic Milkha! To me, it would be no surprise if he fetches a National Award for this role! Milkha Singh runs against turbulent times of his life and establishes world records; conquers not just medals for India, but Indian hearts too! A big salute and cheers for this national hero!This is a true tribute to this Indian, Flying Sikh! And, if you want to be inspired, motivated and get a going in your personal life then go for it!" 
" MY REVIEW: Run Farhan Run!!","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag works for two basic reasons. One it is based on the story of a sports person whose personal life is dramatic enough to keep you engaged apart from its racing track achievements and second it is played by Farhan Akhtar who plays his role as if he is really Milkha Singh himself. Farhan Akhtar excels playing Milkha Singh like Ben Kingsley excelled playing Gandhi. Farhan Akhtar seems to be enjoying every bit of the movie. When he runs, he runs like a tiger. When he dances, he dances like a pure Punjabi. When he loves, he loves with innocence and passion. Farhan Akhtar can easily be given all best actor awards of 2013. All supporting actors give their best. Divya Dutta is excellent, Sonam Kapoor looks fresh, Pawan Malhotra and Parkash Raj's performance are heartwarming. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is first rate and awe inspiring. Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra like an expert captain provides movie its uniqueness, technical perfection, soul and purpose. Like an every fantastic experience, this also comes with its dull moments. Movie takes around extra half an hour before reaching to its finale. Rangrezz song could have been avoided and prolonged sequences of Milkha's achievements could have been shortened. Dilip Tahil playing Pandit Nehru looks like a missed stroke. At the end, you can safely say, you had a great time running with Farhan Akhtar for more than 3 hours. Run to your nearest theater now to watch this powerful biopic." 
" bhaag milkha bhaag will make u stun !!!!!!!!!!!!!","wow wow wow ! what a movie BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG ! this movie is exceptional, the best biography that i have ever witnessed whether in Hollywood or bollywood! just watch it ! rather make it compulsory for the students of class 9-12 so that they could understand the anguish and agony of being motivated and in turn achieve what u actually desire! the movie is completely abt what MILKHA SINGH WAS ! he was an athlete ??? no ! he was something beyond we have known to him ! if i say that the best bollywood movie of all time then believe me i am telling the truth ! Farhan Akhtar is the soul of the movie, this movie completely revolves around him and his desire to achieve success and struggle in life ! he is my favorite after this one ! all the other cast have been great and done justice to their roles. sonam had a little to do but she contributed well ! from direction to screen play , cinematography to acting everything worth watching ! a 200 minute movie needs at least a time of more than 3.5 hrs to watch it , but one would not move from the seat after entering into the theater ! hats off to whole cast and crew ! **********(10 stars)" 
" Milkha Singh Has Won. So Has The Biographical Film. Everybody Rise! ♦ 80%","In less than ten minutes into the film, you get goosebumps all over your body. You get into high-spirits and then the story of The Flying Sikh begins...It talks more about perseverance and how man can excel even in the worst conditions than the actual atheltic history. Milkha Singh, wonderfully portrayed by the talented Farhan Akhtar is one character that induces inspiration. Akhtar now has totally proved himself as a successful actor. His demeanor is appreciable and the film does showcase his hard-work. Supporting cast is very good as well. But, the actresses were sidelined which is very apt for a bio-film.Most of the story is told in flashbacks and there is where the screenplay works. It grabs your attention. The childhood story MAY bore you a little, but every other biopic has to be honest. Much like last year's Paan Singh Tomar, BMB does have lots of surprises in store. The relation of every detail is astronomical and very well adapted. Fresh writing, inventive editing & below-average SFX/CGI makes me wanna give it a humble 8.0/10.The songs & score are energetic which do cause an urge that we run with the athletes on-screen. That is the power of Rakeysh O Mehra and his crew. I was blown away by Akhtar's bod and his expressions. Humor touches the script at times, as well.Overall, an entertaining biography which is well-written and well- executed. Only, the running time of 190 minutes COULD'VE... could've been shortened. Otherwise, everybody rise for this cinema of massive potential.BOTTOM LINE: A very good entertainer with mentoring prowess. It feels good that the team has brought an epitome into reel. Kudos!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: No | Nudity: Mild | Sex/Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Violence/Gore: Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Smoking/Drugs: No" 
" Milkha bann gaya India - A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT!!","I watched a Paid-Preview of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag last night and I was star-strucked by its fame watching the house-full crowd in the theater (as if it is the first day of the release). When I first watched its teaser in October last year and first trailer in January..it had me going since then, and now I am happy that my expectation was worth it.BRIEF STORY & REVIEW SKETCH. The film is about Milkha Singh and introspects his being through the eyes of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. There are no twists or turns in the movie but its just a tale told on a clean slate. Film starts with a defeat in Olympics, carried on when Milkha refuses to visit Pakistan (has his valid reasons for doing so) but Pt. Nehru sends Milkha's latter and former coach to Chandigarh so that they can convince him for the tour. During the train-journey, Pavan Malhotra (former coach) reveals the story of Milkha Singh and his reason to not visit Pakistan to the other two gentlemen which unleashes an assiduous, interesting and penultimate story about the legend. This Sikh has been running his whole life, starting his first race for a glass of milk to the Olympics..and never ending. It reminds me of the great metaphor ' The race of Life'. Milkha Singh ran to save his life, to eat, to dream, for love, for country, for passion and to overcome his own personal fears, ''and what a run it was!''. BMB traces his scarred childhood, brutalized by India's partition ; followed by penury and petty crimes. He finds the purpose of life when he falls for Beeru (Sonam). Joins the Indian Army and since then his passion, eagerness and situations along with the efforts (negative & positive both) made by different people led him to become an athlete, a runner who remained uncased even by his own daemons. He keeps on breaking records but witnesses a heartbreaking defeat in Rome Olympics (1960) but thats not it, he takes it in his stride, overcomes his catastrophic past which was the cause of Olympic defeat and emerges out to be a clear winner.OVERVIEWROPM delivers yet again a tale in his own style (fond of changing tones in his films), where the length is bit of a disappointment otherwise the content heals the flaw with a superb execution and sticky pace, that tops with Farhan Akhtar's outstanding performance (the actor gave his blood n sweat into the character) and he emerges out to be the soul of the movie physically and mentally. The story by Prasoon Joshi is admirable and the track 'Zinda' is well written by him, beautifully composed by Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy and descriptively choreographed by Shaimak Davar. The background score by the trio adds on to the whole movie. The performances from the other cast is noticeable where Divya Dutta deserves a special mention (Hats off to the lady for creating a great impact in spite of having such a small role) The film truly deserves to be one of the best that Bollywood has offered this year so far and I hope to see some more in-depth biopics like this in coming future.I'd rate this dig-till-hell marvel biopic as 8/10." 
" What a Movie "WAF"","What a dam Good Movie.... Its one of the must see movie... Apart from true story, the movie is very motivational and it will suck within while watching.... however at time in flashbacks its slow, but for a minute or so... but it takes off so high when it comes to race and sprite.... its kind of movie you can compare it with "Rocky" series from "Sylvester Stallone"All to All... loved watching this movie... apart from its 3:08 minutes long... ;)Must watch movie...10 Star Rating!!"

I Like the way flash back was going on ,it was a shattering flashback that was amazing to watch ,every time when the movie was going in the flashback it was awesome experience to watch it .love this movie ." 
" Review of negative reviews","Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a great movie according to me. Unfortunately, it has received reviews from both extremes. The people who have disliked the movie because of its pace are very impatient souls. The movie's depth is only understood when the mind is tuned to the perfectly timed pace of events of the movie. I read a review that said 'for a fast runner movie, it is extremely slow paced'. There is no damn connection between between a life story of a runner and the pace of the movie. I think such reviewers are so used to reviewing commercial non-sensical masala films that they have forgotten what real movies are like.Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a movie that is crafted for excellence by the very second." 
" Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a true inspirational movie for all us.","The man who create history with his hard work and passion SIR MILKHA SINGH..The movie is awesome. The first biopic movie ever made in Bollywood which create a boom all over the world.FARHAN AKHTAR show us what he able to do in films.Totally appreciate his work in the movie. now he is Bollywood ROCKEY BALBOA.People now see him how he trained himself and spent time in gym and stadium. After RANG DE BASANTI RAKEYSH OMPARKASH MEHRA shows his direction talent again. Prasoon Joshi fully justice to script of the movie he actually done a great job with the story and presentation of movie is up to the mark.About MILKHA SINGH JI.He is a living legend and true inspiration for all of us." 
" Bhaag Milkha Bhaag – A Flying Tale of A Flying Sikh","A great movie experience is a combination of many things. It includes a convincing plot, high voltage drama, light moments that stay with viewers even when they leave the theatre, good music, inspirational elements and a few emotional scenes. "Bhaag Milkha Bhaag" is among those movies which offer all the above mentioned ingredients at par. For those who keep a track of innovative, interesting and path breaking Indian Cinema the name of Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra is the symbol of excellence. Whenever he unfolded his sleeves, movies like "Aks", "Rang de Basanti" and "Delhi-6" were witnessed by cine-goers. All these movies are distinctive in one way or the other. BMB is nothing different than them. It is a master stroke – without a doubt. Farhan Akhtar secretes immense talent but no one has, up till Rakeysh Om Prakash, utilized that talent. Farhan's directorial ventures "Dil Chahta Hai" and "Lakshya" made people realize his credibility as one of the finest directors. As an actor, BMB is his landmark. The way he has carried out his role and portrayed his emotions definitely demand standing ovation.BMB is based on the journey of great Indian athlete Milkha Singh (also known as Flying Sikh). It is a movie about a boy whose entire family excluding his elder sister was murdered in the riots of Indo-Pak partition and he became a national and international rage back in 1960's. It is also about the bond between a brother and sister – executed with exceptional detailing. Moreover, the movie is about a blooming romance, some promises with loved ones, emotional fits, flying high yet not leaving the ground by any means and a lot more. In short it's about the life of Milkha Singh and what he went through.Performance wise, Farhan Akhtar deserves to be nominated for this movie especially by critics. He is a revelation in BMB. He tackles the most difficult parts with complete ease and effortlessness. His transitions can be easily witnessed and felt by the audience from first scene to the last. Divya Dutta as Milkha Singh's sister is vibrant, emotional, lovable and above all highly expressive. In 2 of the scenes particularly, she involved the audience to a level by her performance that no one could resist moistening their eyes. This is a performance she will always be reminded of. Sonam Kapoor (as Biro), Meesha Shafi (as Perizaad) and Rebecca Breeds (as Stella) had limited roles but they all performed well in their respective characters. Pavan Malhotra (as Milkha Singh's senior) is inspirational and at his peak. This actor is unfortunately most underrated, he needs to be casted in more movies to show-case his vast talent. Yograj Singh as (Milkha Singh's coach) is just perfect. Dalip Tahil is strictly passable and ditto for Dev Gill (Abdul Khaliq). Art Malik (as Milkha Singh's father) and Jabtej Singh (as young Milkha Singh) are credible and treat to watch.Music of this movie is amazing. Arif Lohar's "Bhaag Milkha", Sukhwinder Singh's "Slow Motion Angrezza", Suhas Sawant's "Zinda" and Divya Kumar's "Maston Ka Jhund" are totally different from one another yet are really awesome tracks in all respects. Shankar-Ehsan-Loy's music is simply amazing for this venture.Some sequences to lookout for – performance wise:When Farhan asks from where can he buy the Indian Team's blazer!When Divya Dutta meets young Milkha Singh in the camp.When Farhan insists Divya to wear his blazer – the scene would definitely bring tears to many viewers' eyesWhen Farhan slaps himself repeatedly in the washroomand a lot moreOn the basis of performance, direction, execution and story-telling I would easily rate this movie 9/10. It's a must watch for those who celebrates quality and inspirational cinema. A must watch!"
