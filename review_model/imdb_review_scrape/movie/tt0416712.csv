" Action and justice","Elaan really entertained me. I especially loved Rahul Khanna's acting in this one. I also loved the special friendship that the five heroes developed as they plotted the ultimate demise of Baba, an evil man who needed his just desserts. Arjun was really good as well. I especially enjoyed the location scenes in Europe; the road action scene was spectacular! The women were pretty, especially the Sonia character, who is beyond gorgeous! I loved this movie so much that I bought it. I have recommended it to my friends who have also viewed and enjoyed it. Give it a try for yourself, even if it is just to see Rahul Khanna at work, because this guy can certainly act!" 
" A great cast with a mediocre story","I finally saw this movie recently only for Arjun Rampal. I wasn't expecting this to be a great caper movie like many Hollywood movies, so I wasn't really disappointed.For the most part, I thought the cast did a really good job with their performance even though they didn't have much to work with. The nice thing about the movie was the treatment with nice locales.Apart from that I was very impressed with Arjun Rampal and John Abraham. Both their characters were well defined unlike the others'. They reminded me of Amitabh and Dharmendra duo or the SRK and Salman Khan duo from Karan Arjun. Wish the movie had more scenes with just these two together.I heard Arjun Rampal was to play Rahul's character while Bobby Deol was to play Arjun's character. Since Bobby couldn't do the movie Arjun opted out for the character he plays and I have to say that that character suits him far better than Rahul's.This movie is worth one or two viewing only for Arjun and John. I give it 7/10." 
" a sleek, almost Hollywood-style, good vs evil movie","Fortunately, I haven't seen any of the other movies that many reviewers state have had bits copied from them in Elaan. So, I didn't think this was a bad film. The multiple location approach made for great scenery (although I had to laugh when they gave the impression that Venice and the Swiss Alps are around the corner from each other) and gave a bit of a 007 air to the story.What drew me to the movie was the cast. I hadn't seen much of their earlier work, so this was a good chance to see what they could do. Rahul Khanna holds his own as does Arjun Rampal, so hopefully this will lead to more films for both of them. Amisha Patel and Lara Dutta are good enough. It's not their faults if some of their dialog is lame. John Abraham is good at being angry, fighting, and looking sexy in songs, but other than that, he's not believable. Even his voice seemed monotone at times as if he was just reading the lines in the playback. It's really Mithun Chakraborthy who is the star of this film. He nailed his role as the bad guy by showing that fear can be generated without shouting at people all the time. I really believed his character's evil mind. Thank goodness they didn't make him sing and dance..." 
" One more time Sholay (1975) has been revisited","One more Masala movie released on the same day along with another masala movie Insan. One more time Sholay (1975) has been revisited and that too by Vikram Bhatt whose every movie is plagiarize of a Hollywood pictures and even this time also there are so many scenes which are lifted from different Hollywood products. Even Sholay was a mixture of 2 to 3 Hollywood movies i.e. The Seven Samurai, The magnificent 7, Once upon in a west.This time the Thakur role is played by Rahul Khanna, Jai and Veeru roles are played by Arjun Rampal and John Abraham and Gabbar role went to the Legendary Actor Mithun Chakraborty who has made a comeback in A grade movies with Elaan and will win the nomination in the best villain category. He has given a remarkable performance after Gudiyareleased in 98.Rahul Khanna has debuted in the commercial cinema with this movie and has done a great job. He performed his role with confidence. John Abraham has gone overboard in few sequences and also in his introductory action scene (which is a lift from First Blood 3 a.k.a. Rambo 3. I think Vikram like that action scene because he used that action scene in Awara Pagal Deewana for Sunil Shettys introductory action scene). Arjun Rampal is functional and has given a conventional performance. Amisha Patel has done a good job after Humraaz.She was looking gorgeous in this movie and got more footage than the Lara Dutta and why not she is the girlfriend of the captain of he ship, I mean the director of the film, Vikram Bhatt. Lara Dutta has done her stunts by herself (she tried to become like Lara Croft) but has nothing much to do except showcasing her attractive face and body. Ritu Shivpuri has done fine job in a short role. One wonders she should have got a full fledge role in this movie and why the directors are not casting her in their movies. Chunky Pandey has also done a fine job in a short role.Escaping from the prison is a direct lift from Spy Game. And even Arjuns first action scene is a lift from Hard Target. The major setback in the movie is the climax. The way they trap Mithun makes you wonder if he really all that powerful (as it has been shown in the beginning of the film that his phone call can sound your death knell) and he does nothing except sitting silently in a room. What happened to all that flames, anger and poison? Elaan has few scenes lifted from Loha released in 87 and China Gate released in 98 which were also inspired by the movies The Seven Samurai, The magnificent 7, Once upon in a west. Scenes like when Shatrughan Sinha promises his son (young jugal hansraj) in the movie Loha that he will take him for holidays but the mission comes in between and he leave for mission and break his promise and also when Naseeruddin Shah wants to adopt a girl in the movie China Gate and he dies and after that Om Puri does the service. In Elaan too, Arjun make promise to his child but breaks it because of the mission and when he dies in the end Rahul adopts his child.Cinemography is of first rate. Well penned dialogues and good choreography. Appealing background score.As predicted, it will do a good business in interiors and its good news for Mithun Chakraborty fans that they will get to see a good movie with a good performance by the Legend. 21/2 Out of 5." 
" Sleek action thriller despite lack of story","Mithun "Dada" makes a great comeback as the antagonist in this action-packed thriller. He proves his worth in the climax of the movie with his convincing expressions and dialogues. Action is fantastic. Set in Europe, the action sequences are very thrilling. The beauty of Indian cinema is that even in a hardcore action film, you'll find a soul and emotions. The bonding of the "five unlikely heroes," their support for each other, and their determinations and frustrations were nicely shown. However, there is not much of a story in this movie. There is basically one mission for the team of five and their efforts towards accomplishing it. Nonetheless, the well-executed action scenes and character development fill that void. Songs are OK. Performances are decent. (Funny note: John Abraham's yelling/hissing noise at the end is really comical.)" 
" Great Movie","Elaan was a fantastic, action-packed film. I find it very difficult to find an exciting, entertaining Hindi film, yet this film fit the bill perfectly! There is not a second of boredom in the film. There are even a couple of comedic scenes, a couple of heart-wrenching emotional scenes, lots of action, etc. This has become one of my favorite movies. And it is filled with the coolest star cast - Amisha Patel, John Abraham, Arjun Rampul, etc. etc. You have to see this movie. Don't listen to any bad reviews you might read about it - movie critics are always unreasonably tough and harsh when it comes to rating films. I guarantee, it is a great film!!!!! (I was not paid to write this comment!)" 
" Elaan is a blockbuster smash hit - one of India's No.1 all-time action movie","I have to say that no doubt Elaan has to be one of India's No.1 all-time action movie. The casting is absolutely spot-on. Mithun makes a superb villain, it was great to see him back after such a long time. The five heroes were brilliant. I can't even make up my mind to choose who is the star of the movie.I loved all of the phone conversations between, Rahul Khanna and Mithun, especially when Rahul Khanna made his Elaan to Mithun. In some scenes John Abraham is absolutely hilarious and in other scenes he is the main action stunt-man. The stunts that he does in the end battle are mind-blowing. What can you say about Arjun Rampal, you could just say that, without him, the mission wouldn't have even got off to a start. The scene, where all 5 of the heroes are trapped in Mithun's house, would have to be one of the best scenes, in the movie. It's all because of Arjun, that they manage to escape. The way he just dives out of the window, with guns blazing, was fascinating. Although me, personally, I thought that he was insane to jump out like that and take on Mithun's men, while the others were in the house. I started cheering when he jumped out, because I thought it was all over, when they were all surrounded in the house. Critics also have said that it was ridiculous, the way Mithun lets them go away, when he had an easy chance to kill the heroes. The fact is that they didn't just walk away, Arjun Rampal did all of the hard work and fought off most of Mithun's men. You can ask the same question, with just about every other movie. Like for example Â– In Sholay, why didn't Gabar Singh just kill Thakur, when he had the easiest chance to kill him (Sanjeev Kumar a.k.a Thakur was tied up) There have been so many movies where similar situations have occurred and the critics haven't said anything then, so what's the point of criticising a superb movie like Elaan, now.I don't know what the critics, are talking about. They absolutely ruined the movie, with their comments. They even said that the girls, were forced into the movie and had nothing to do with the movie. Lara Dutta was glamorous in the movie. You can understand why she joins the battle against Mithun. She loves John Abraham and wants to stand by him, no matter what. How many other movies are there where women do the same for the person that they love and the movies have been hits.I admit that Amisha Patel might have been forced into the movie, but there are certain major scenes, which couldn't have been done without her. E.g. when they try to track Mithun's location via mobile phone and satellite and at the end when the french police turn up, it's all because of Amisha Patel.Overall I would have to say that I have seen Elaan for the fifth time inside a week. I don't know what the critics problems are. Sometimes I think that they are watching one movie and writing reviews about another. It's because of these critics that Elaan, has been reviewed as average. This isn't the first time that this has happened. There are other great movies that have been publicly ruined, because of negative reviews. To me Elaan is a blockbuster smash hit. I can't wait for the DVD release of the movie.I hope that this review will help other people, who are interested in watching this movie. My advice is "IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ELAAN, WHAT ARE ALL OF YOU PEOPLE DOING? ARE YOU INSANE? GET ON TO THE ROLLERCOSTER, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED"" 
" One of the best Indian action films !!","I just saw this movie on weekend and loved every bit of it !! i don't know whether its going to be a hit commercially but it was fun action packed ride. very few Indian films match upto the technical quality shown in this film, it is heavily inspired by classics like shaan and sholay but the subject of catching a terrorist is treated differently and effectively, critics said the film lacks in content but it was never meant to be a dramatic fare. it lives upto the best in the genre of action thrillers. after "dhoom" this is the best Indian action film. performances were good and good to see mithun back on the big screen after a long time. if u like action movies you will love this one.8 out of 10." 
" Best Hollywood Presentation!!!!!!!!!","When i saw this movie, i was stunned. I mean when i saw all fives heroes, and i one villain in this movie who is Mithun, i absolutely loved this movie. I give Amisha Patel a 7/10, she looked beautiful n loved the way she portrayed as a reporter. I will give Lara Dutta a 8/10 cause she knows what to do in this film and looks like she's going to be the next Lara Croft, so then i give her a 7.5/10. For John, he really was very funny for pretty much playing a comedian, she should go on with the look that he has in this film n also do action films more often, so then i give him a 8/10. For Arjun, he had a good performance in this movie because he mostly did everything, and also knows how and what to do in this mission, so then i give him also a 9/10. This was Rahul Khanna's first action n that i thought that he did pretty good in this Gil so that i give him a 9/10. Most of all, in this film, this film belongs to Mithun because he had a great performance of being a terror in this movie, and also had a great comeback too, so for Mithun i give him a 10/10. If any one of you people who didn't watch this movie, what are you doing??, i mean get up and watch this movie, its such a good movie. People this movie is kind of like the old Hindi film movie "sholay", so ya i know for sure that everyone will see this movie. And that i give this movie a 10/10." 
" Good-looking, Good Fun","I too thought Elaan was interesting, although the musical songs didn't particularly stand out. The cast were all good-looking -- Arjun Rampal, John Abraham, Lara Dutta, Amisha Patel, and even Rahul Khanna were all nice to look at. As far as the action scenes, some of the stuff was interesting in a "Sword of Gideon" type of way, but it was all over-the-top in a way that's typical of all Indian movies. It was nice to see some of India's best bodies and faces altogether in a scenic European backdrop. Even the mobster guy projected a unique malevolence. I think that a lot of Indian critics typically base their praise or criticism of any movie based on how politically correct it is. If it has any type of politically serious tone to it (eg. anti-terrorism) instead of the usual frivolous fantasy fluff, then there are a lot of left-wing writers who'll pounce to make any nitpick they can. So I'd say it's an entertaining over-the-top action thriller, but don't try to bash it by comparing it to Shakespeare." 
" It would have gone overboard if it was any better!","At the start, it was a little slow to pick up but once all five main characters have been established, then the true action begins. A prominent business man in Mumbai is murdered, and his son puts together a team of heroes to help bring his father's killer to justice. That would be the best way to summarise it. But I will go further in the next paragraphs because I loved this film so much. Basically, the story is about NRI Karan Shah who returns home to India when he is summoned that his father has been receiving death threats due to an extortion that he (the father) refuses to cave in to. When KS reaches India, instead of adhering to his sister's pleas to send the money to the underworld lord who has been bothering them, he advices his father to stick to his guns and not cave in to the madness. In the process, the father is killed and the sister alienates herself from the brother. The brother then takes the task upon himself to seek revenge for his father's death, in the process he meets a plucky reporter played by Amisha Patel, who instantly is smitten with him but to whom he does not return her affections. He reluctantly allows her to tang along on the journey to Switzerland which along the way he also recruits Arjun Rampal's character, a former police officer who is also a widower with a little daughter at home. Rampal's characters leads the assembling team to John Abraham's character, who is a career criminal and former henchman for Baba Sikander (the underworld lord). Currently doing time behind bars, they help him escape from prison and he leads them to Lara Dutta's character, whom he tells them is Baba's the underworld lord girlfriend. The team of five unlikely heroes is then assembled and the plot thickens as Baba leads them on a wild goose chase through Europe. The truth about Lara Dutta's character is soon revealed and the team wonder if they can ever trust Abraham again. This film reminded me very much about Khakee but with a different spin on the idea of extraditing a criminal from point A to point B. The grail here is not so holy, in fact, the grail here is not holy at all. The character introductions were excellent, I really enjoyed the way they slowly panned that out and the way one character always led to another. One scene that really stuck out to me was the one in which the director capture's Arjun's powerful rage when he attacks Baba Sikander's underworld henchmen following the death of his wife. The action scenes in the rain (at the French border) were also awesome! especially John Abraham's umbrella stunts. Amisha Patel plays her reporter babe with decent fervour. She is feisty, this woman! :) And Lara Dutta captures sexy like you've never seen before! But as much as I loved this film, there were a few problems that I had with it, and they are as follows: 1.] What kind of tight security allows for an assassin hiding in an elevator shaft to go undetected? 2.] The character Arjun is a former police inspector who lost both his job and wife yet he can still afford to live in a swanky hill top retreat-like home? 3.] Nurses in the ICU bring Arjun's newborn baby out into the hospital's reception where Arjun is waiting. A newborn baby? weren't they worried about the baby catching anything or being exposed and stuff? I dunno, but it didn't look right to me. 4.] If Baba Sikander was so powerful, then why didn't he order a hit on Karan Shah when he was threatened? 5.] The blatant disregard for the dead. {see John Abraham's jail breakout scene} 6.] Abhimanu (John Abraham) is given a fake name which he never bothers to use during the course of the film. That said, how many films can you find so many problems with and yet still love it? Elaan totally rocked. Maybe it was the double-dose of eye-candy they gave use by casting John Abraham and Arjun Rampal, I dunno but whatever they did, I liked it. :) I also liked and picked up on the love triangle that many people may miss or may have missed watching the film. Amisha Patel's character is in love with Karan Shah, but every time she made a move, KS would rebuff her. Arjun picked up on this and started showing her affection. If you missed this the first time, go back and watch it and you will see. I feel the the love triangle is the reason for the Arjun shocker twist! One angle of the triangle always has to yield to the most dominant and in the end only two can be equal." 
" A Tactical Hit","While, to an extent, I do believe from reading the comments of other reviewers that the movie lacked a good storyline, and the characters are somewhat unbelievable, I liked this movie for amazing acting, despite the character flaws; I liked it because the tactics used in the movie are amazingly realistic and for the most part, practical. Sure, movies are often exaggerated and this one is no exception, some are exaggerated beyond the realms of acceptable beliefs of reality. This, however, is just within the confines of it. I enjoyed the movie and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactical warfare...to the smaller scale. Hope it helped!" 
" Mithun Chakraborty is a legend.","Vikram Bhatt's 'Elaan' which came way back in 2005, is still in my mind because of Mithun Chakraborty. I feel Elaan will be remembered for the outstanding portrayal of Mithunda. I can go on and on praising Mithunda.... but even as a film 'Elaan' is underrated. The film is entertaining and even for a minute you're not bored. The film has its share of flaws, but come on 'Elaan' didn't promise to be a milestone of a watch. A very well-directed film, with a stellar performance by Mithunda. Pluses of the film: Mithunda, Mithunda, Mithunda, Mithunda. He's the biggest asset of the venture, playing Baba Sikandar to perfection. He's fantastic from start to end. Vikram Bhatt has directed the film very well. The stunts are very-well done. Performances by the other actor are also good: Rahul Khanna plays his part well. Arjun Rampal is very good, and yes his exit gives a lump in your throat. John is likable. Amisha and Lara are decent. Chunkey Pandey is passable.Minuses of the film: Mithunda should have been there throughout.on the whole 'Elaan' is a entertaining watch... more than anything else, watch it for legendary actor Mithunda's powerful performance." 
" Sad comeback for Mithun fans","Can't understand why the film makers chose this movie for Mithun's comeback and then give him nothing to do. Not one worthy scene or dialog for him. The action sequences are good. John Abraham as the 'Tapori' should know that he is not Amir Khan in Rangeela - please stick to what you are capable of doing - showing off your torso and bashing people. Not much can be said about Arjun Rampal's performance and Rahul Khanna should stick to cross-over films - he has no commercial cinema presence at all. Girls (Amisha and Lara) does anyone tell you'll the story before you accept the film or do you just go for the shoot??" 
" Elaan-Waste of Time","This was a bad movie, it was my time wasted but it was also producers money wasted. Why would you not do little homework before making a Film. Some sequences just leave u dumbfounded not because they are marvelous but because they are not entertaining. Film maker has spent money in shooting outdoors but what does he bring to his viewers despite that. The answer is NOTHING. Movie has no story, some scenes are just simply stupid, it feels like this movie was completed in a hurry. Director goes back to old bollywood formula of revenge films, which made no sense at all. Heroes will fly, cars will fly, and also beat up guys with better gun yet end up victorious at the end. Every time a car crash in the movie it was big fire ball, how come. They said in the promos it was a Hollywood style movie yet the action scenes were horribly shot, the sound was horrible, music was below mediocrity. The characters looked misplaced. Some were good and most of them were not good. Mithun was good, but disappointing because he just sat there and talked on the phone, he should've bagged out some of his old karate chops. Rahul kHanna could act nice and controlled performance. Arjun Rampal was OK, he was there in the movie but he was pushed all the way to the side by the story. John didn't fit the character, his tapori dialogue delivery was bad, and comic timing was awful, and he did overact most of the time. There is not much to talk about the ladies as i said this is re-visitation to old bollyflick where ladies sing, dance and look pretty. No Acting talents require. OVerall story was horrible because it had too many loopholes. ITs too many to write about, see it to believe it. I feel bad for the producers cause there money is put to waste. And advice to action filmmakers chill with the wire action sequences beats the whole purpose of watching a good movie when guys start flying for no reason whatsoever out of no where. Thats not Hollywood style of ACtion." 
" My name is Bond---Junk----Bond.","I hate to downplay a movie specially when the Filmamakers spend enormous amount of money on a foreign location but when they come up with a jalopy action film-it is well deserved. First and foremost is the music or lack of it specially the background music. The Story is as stagnant as the waters of Venice(It appears that Venice has only two cars and both are used by Baba Secunder). The two actors who cannot emote are Lara Dutta and Arjun Rampal and the two who can are Amisha Patel and John Abraham-and the one who really did some acting was Rahul Khanna. As far as Amisha Patel-this square jawed actress with ears as big as Himachal Pradesh looks cute in Anna Singh designed clothes but she has peaked in her acting with "Gadar" and looks with "Humraaz". As far as John Abraham-a good actor under state of confusion.Mithun Chakraborty--fits the bill as a Hindi Villain, since he is tall,dark,has long sideburns (or freshly painted)), and his voice comes across as strong and mean for ransom demands on Board room speaker phones!. I can't fathom a director in the caliber of Vikram Bhatt (Raaz) directing this "junk Bond" film. The song breaks and the "personal narration" that breaks into a song interludes are the only break from the monotony of endless gunfire when the ammo runs out a lifeless character is doneaway. The movie has nothing to offer in the way of entertainment or action-a disappointment coming from Vikram Bhatt."
