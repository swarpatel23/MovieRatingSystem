" A Nutshell Review: English Vinglish","Many will know I have been following Bollywood films over the last few years with keen interest, with one of the prime reasons being, why not? We have dedicated halls and screens which are always showing the latest the industry has to offer, very often having same day premieres, and I cannot fathom having to close this option off for the lack of language ability. English subtitles is a boon, and my only option to understand what's being said on screen. English is of course the plot element here in this film, written and directed by Gauri Shinde, who has made a film that's strong in heart, and powerful in performance.I'm talking about Sridevi's comeback to cinema, having retired some 15 years ago to raise her kids. And this leave of absence surely helped her in her protagonist role here, but more on that later. For those unaware, like I was previously, Sridevi is arguably the best actress Indian Cinema has produced over the last few decades, and it is only today that I fully understood why. Her performance as Shashi, the traditional Indian housewife, is impeccable, and the littlest of nuances put into her role, reaped results in the manifold. As a line of dialogue described, her eyes are like coffee drops in a saucer of milk, and that in itself is an understatement.Charisma is something that you have, or have not, and Sridevi's presence is something that arrests your attention immediately when she comes on screen. Carrying the entire movie, it's unbelievable to think that she's pushing 50 already, as her performance here will probably inspire many actresses of today's generation sit up and take note, to realize that they still have a long way to go to reach a fraction of her level. I'm sold, impressed, and very eager to catch up on her filmography to see what more she had to offer during the 80s and 90s when she was at the peak of her popularity then.Her comeback in English Vinglish is a casting coup for its filmmakers, and let's not forget Shinde's story which was custom fit for her as well, playing the role of a mother, which probably made it quite an easy transition back to the industry. But it's an important role because one of the key takeaways from the narrative, is how we often take those who love us for granted, and as part of the process, inadvertently hurt them too. We may not realize it, or sometimes we do, but these hurt will likely be the worst possible. A callous word and a careless comment go a long way, and is difficult to, or sometimes cannot be taken back.It's something many of us have been through and experienced, regardless which side of the equation one was on, where respect does not get accorded, and where words go out to make others feel small about themselves. In Shashi's case, this happens to be her lack of command in the English language, perceived to be an ability of social status, made quite unbearable when her children thinks it so, and when her husband (Adil Hussain) also gets in on a private joke with their daughter.The film's story worked on many layers, and what I especially admired is how Sridevi becomes the spokesperson for lessons without being too overt about it, save for the ending speech that hammers in the emotion, and is sure to make your eyes well up. It deals with, on a macro level, how as humans we should be helpful and tolerant to those who don't speak our language or understand our culture, that one shouldn't be made to think one's superior just because, or make the other look small. And on the more micro level, the structure of the family and its importance. All these and more, told through a story about a woman finding her inner strength to stand out, stand up and be counted, building and reinforcing confidence that she's more than just a Laddoo machine.But social factors aside, the more obvious ingredient that's put into the movie, is the Mind Your Language type scenes when Shashi enrolls herself into an English crash course to learn conversational English in four weeks. Instead of Mr Brown, there's Mr David (Cory Hibbs) the teacher (whose sexual orientation again highlights the differences in the human race and the need for tolerance and acceptance), and a motley crew of classmates from various parts of the world bonding together. From a woman who centered her life around family, building a network of friends became something of a lifeline of sorts, in keeping life interesting through the sharing of experiences, and of course, food.English Vinglish has everything a typical Indian film contains, from comedy to romance - handled with such maturity - culture and language. What more, it has Sridevi's remarkable return, showing why she was, and still is, one of the iconic female actresses ever to grace the screens of Indian Cinema. A definite recommendation, and though formulaic at parts, is delivered with such slickness, that I'd shortlist it as one of the best this year." 
" English Vinglish ∞ The Class for Earning Self Respect ∞",""If we don't love ourselves we use to attract towards new things but as soon as we began to love ourselves we feel confident and old things look prettier again." This is one dialogue from the movie's lead protagonist which teaches how one can come back to his normal life; English Vinglish is a sweet Laddu with almonds of a logical script, cashew nuts of nice music, raisins of love and pistachios of Hope. English Vinglish is not about just English classes, it's just a metaphor or platform to narrate a simple yet very effective story of self determination, self respect and love about family and love about ourselves.English Vinglish is undoubtedly a movie about the Family, the children & their attitude towards their parents, the husband who does not see his wife skills and potential beyond a born Laddu Maker and yes, it's about a mother who lost her identity as a woman in the society after marriage being a house wife, as her world does not go beyond her family.Shashi Godbole (Sridevi) is a simple middle class housewife living with her husband Satish (Adil Hussain) along with her daughter Sapna and a son named Sagar in Pune, India. She is an excellent cook searching for her own respect among children and husband due to poor understanding of English language. One day she got the call from her sister to visit New York to attend her daughter's wedding, but she was reluctant to go alone because of her poor English language, thou she finally agreed on her husband's persuasion. In New York, during her visit to a café she felt humiliated due to her understanding of English language which brought a reason for her to fight against the odds and make a place for herself. She left from there and suddenly saw an advertisement for four weeks English speaking classes and that's how she got the way to prove herself by learning a language which is global now and a synonym of 'Being Modern' in Indian societies called English, for Her VINGLISH.Overall, English Vinglish is a memorable watch for the genuine script, superb performances, nice music and definitely the feel good factor it has. In Last scene, Shashi requests the air hostess a Hindi newspaper in English Language, and that's we called in Sridevi's MJ Style without getting 'Judgemental' –YoOO.Regards Your's AvAFor complete review Please visit www.thecritiquelab.comReaders' Feedback is appreciated" 
" A Satisfying Experience","The essence of few stories lies in its simplicity portraying characters from our day-to-day lives and their struggle. English Vinglish is one such beautifully woven simple concept with which audience can identify themselves.English Vinglish is the story of Mrs Shashi Godvale,a regular home-maker from an upper middle-class household whose life revolves around doing the regular household chores. Alongwith homemaking she keeps her passion for cooking intact and within the homely set-up started a small scale business by making laaddoos. Her potential never gets the due diligence from either her indifferent husband who seem to get charged up only in bed, or her daughter who is ashamed of her mother's lack of English knowledge. It seems her lack of sophistication has even crafted the gap with her husband. She is more connected to her little son and her caring mother-in-law. Under circumstances she lands up in New York for her elder niece's wedding and eventually in an English tuition class and the story follows how her life changes thereafter. Learning a new language is symbolic of a key to regain her long lost confidence and self-esteem. Gauri Shinde's directorial debut needs to be applauded for the sheer treatment of the film. She wrote a dignified script which never crossed the line becoming overtly-dramatic. Her skill lies in passing a relevant message without getting didactic. The film re-iterates the importance of woman in our lives. In fact it is dedicated to all the middle-class housewives who are never valued in their own household in this patriarchal society.Mrs Godvale showcases pathos of all such women who are dying under the burden of inconsequential existence even though they have significant potential unexplored. Shinde's script does justice to all the characters. The characters are simple and relatable. Mr Godvale is never depicted as a wife beating devil or an infidel husband. He is just a regular working professional who has lost interest in her wife due to cultural differences and sadly that's the scenario of most arranged marriages (still) happening in our country where the wife is not at par as husband in terms of social strata. Such a marriage becomes a compromise, unsigned deal where physical proximity is rampant but the mental bonding is like searching meaning in a RohitShetty film.The English tuition reminds us of famous yesteryear serial "Zaban Sambhalke" where genius Pankiaj Kapoor played the Hindi teacher. There we had hybrid of cultures which created hilarious sequences due to their differences but by the end they got united under the umbrella of a common language. The setting is similar here and the students here are well-edged characters who help in elevating the pace of the film. With mixture of various cultures the experience that comes out is satisfyingly hilarious. Using the back-drop of the tuition class Shinde throws subtle hints on different issues like Indo-Pak peace, tolerance towards homosexuals and understanding them etc. She even used this medium to hint on the hypocrite mindset of male dominated Indo-Pak society as they verbally attacked the French student for openly admitting his soft corner towards Shashi. The relationship between Shahshi and the french student Laurent reminded of relationship shown in WoodyAllen's films. As she converse in Hindi and he reciprocates in French, there seem to be exchange of bouquet of emotions even though they are alien to each other's language. That's the power of feeling and mutual respect which Shashi wanted from her husband. Shashi & Laurent relationship remained as sweet and subtle as the rest of the film. The film can be summarized in one statement of Godvale where she sadly exclaimed that she doesn't need love; she needs Respect. It seems majority of the woman of India is speaking through her and with watery eyes I remember my own mother.I had even lost the opportunity to hug her and openly express my love for her which I never did while she was there beside me Technically the film is well edited by Hemanti Sarkar. The scenes never looked dragged. Utekar's cinematography added the feel-good factor without swaying into K Jo style of escapist extravaganza. Amit Trivedi's music is, as always, rocking. He manages to surprise with every film and his music syncs with the mood of the film, never looking like a separate music album unlike most music directors' scores. Swanand Kirkire is a gifted lyricist and he proved his mettle yet again. And special mention to casting directors (Rita & Sean Powers) who came up with some brilliant and off-beat cast for the film. Sridevi is plain brilliant as Mrs Godvale. I was never a Sridevi fan but was amused by her potential which I felt was never utilized to the fullest barring few films. She looked confident and underplayed her role to suit the character. Adil Hussain as her husband is expectantly efficient and did justice to his NSD degree. One of the finest actors, I sincerely hope this film opens more doors for him. Experienced French actor Mehedi Nebbou was fantastic in the role of Laurent and expressed with his eyes. His equation with Sridevi deserves mention. Priya Anand is spontaneous as Shashi's niece who instills confidence in Shashi's character. Cory Hibbs is rocking as the English teacher. The whole bunch of actors as the students of English tuition are superb. Rest of the supporting cast are all splendid especially the adorable kid who played Shahshi's son. Amitabh Bachchan is present in a meaningful cameo in the flight scene. Overall English Vinglish is a simple and linear yet effective,a touching story of majority housewives of our previous generation. While we are heading towards a more independent society we sincerely hope the mindset towards our woman changes so that we can Really be Proud of our culture and parampara.Hope the time is not far away with more Godvale's understanting their worth and fighting to earn back their dignity rather than letting oneself to be a subject of sympathy." 
" English Vinglish - Beautiful Sheautiful","English Vinglish is a beautiful journey that a middle class Indian housewife takes, to regain something she lost or probably never really got, ironically enough, in a foreign land with a foreign language as a tool.The movie has a simple plan, and audience gets to know about it right at the beginning. There ain't any surprises or twists therein to wow you, its purely the execution of a simple yet universally appealing plot that makes English Vinglish one of the most beautifully made movie of the year.This is a sort of cinema which has traditionally been oiled with loads of melodrama and any director would have wanted to do that considering the fact that people who are going to relate the most with the central character are most prone to be pleasantly affected by the overdose of melodrama ( Yes, I am being a little 'judgemental' here!). Credit must go to Gauri Shinde for shunning the temptation and going ahead with a recipe where she was able to create delight out of right mix of ingredients rather than putting a coating of sugar on the 'laddoos'. Make no mistake, the feel good factor of the movie isn't there just because all the pieces have been put together in the correct order but also because there are layers attached to the story and the characters. These layers help English Vinglish surpass the expectations that an ordinary viewer would have had with it before stepping into the cinema theatre. These layers have been treated with utmost care and are interwoven in the script with great skill. Even though the plot of the movie doesn't encapsulate many genres, the scenes are successful in generating a range of emotions. Thanks to the central plot, humor becomes a part of majority of the scenes and it is never forced upon you.The entertainment quotient of EV is way more than one would have expected. There are a few sequences which could have easily gone in the zone of 'Oh, thats ridiculous!' but yet they were right there in the 'that will do all right' category and this was only possible because of masterful Sridevi who hasn't lost even an inch of her charm and she still stands way ahead of any of the contemporary actresses when it comes to the art of acting. Her presence is so overpowering that one hardly notices or gets annoyed by certain instances of manufactured dialogues and stereotypical display of characters. The journey, the transformation and its impact on the movie and the audience wouldn't have had half the quality had there not been Sridevi at the helm. Every other actor (and guest actor) plays their part well enough to create the right garnish for this savory meal.Without taking any credit away from Gauri Shinde, everything from costumes, to music and locations to screenplay had impressions of R Balki's(producer) previous works and he would have been of great help in the making of EV as well. The affect that English Vinglish will have on a particular individual will depend on the relationship that he/she has with the one/two women that hold the most important place(s) in their lives. The degree of impact will vary, though one thing is for sure, it will only lie on the right side of the axis. http://imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in/" 
" Clap! Clap! Clap!","Superb! Fantastic! Definitely worth a Standing Ovation! This movie is a winner all the way. Right from the script to the characters, everything falls in place. Very difficult to find faults, in fact there is no need to find faults. This movie takes you on a journey of a typical Indian housewife who can hardly speak English. The treatment of the movie is such that you feel a connection with the movie. The best 'part' of the movie is, of course, Sridevi. Yes, The Sridevi. Her acting is so natural and realistic that you feel the emotions that she is going through in the movie. Sridevi has proved once again (after a break of 15 long years) that she is still the Queen of Bollywood, the so-called Female Amitabh Bachchan (as she was known as in the 80s & 90s). I saw this movie today in an overseas theater and not surprisingly, the theater was mostly full of mature audience, her fans. The movie and Sridevi's performance is worth not only many Filmfare Awards but most definitely an Oscar! Well Done Sridevi!" 
" A funny, poignant story of a mother's self discovery.","I rarely watch Hindi movies. Rarer still do I come back appreciating them.English Vinglish is worth it, even a bleary-eyed 6 am review, right after seeing the movie.After just about making it across town to the PVR at Oberoi Mall, Goregaon, was amazed to see that most of the invitees were on time, with thousands of eager fans, waiting to glimpse their favourite stars, and of course the star of the film.As if one needed a reminder, large billboards of Sridevi in a saree against the New York skyline, looking lost, stared back at us all the way.The selling point for this film till the opening has been Sridevi's comeback. For people like me, who aren't a big Sridevi fan, it wasn't the most exciting news. But to contrast, my cousin in the US, much younger than me, and surprisingly a huge fan, (after all she had missed the superstar Sridevi days), has been waiting for this with great anticipation.After the movie got over, I too can be counted as one of the fans. For her fantastic performance. Also for being perfectly cast in the lead role.The pre-hype had already got the basics of the plot out - Indian woman in New York who doesn't know the language, has to pick it up double quick with the help of a motley bunch of fellow non-English speakers. I wouldn't blame you for thinking, "Hey, it must be a 'Mind Your Language' equivalent, I've seen that." Well it is much more than that.Gauri Shinde the award winning short film director and ad film maker is someone we were familiar with. We knew her passion and the dedication to the craft. Her ability to put the story across with minimum fuss.What was a revelation was Gauri Shinde the script writer.English Vinglish is a tight script. Its sweet without being cloying. It holds a mirror where it has to, and at other moments shows the way. The single mindedness of the story and lack of familiar Bollywood distractions of supporting comedians, songs (there are a couple, but in appropriate places), arch villains and hammy side kicks, is what makes the story click.It is humorous, even in the 'familiar' classroom scenes, it is poignant, well-shot, without making New York a tourism board sponsored promotional video. One could sense the director's familiarity with the city, it was obvious she didn't need much help from location scouts.The casting is bang-on. The two kids are a revelation. Especially the younger one. He could be our version of Dakota Fanning. The elder sister was good too, but given that she has age and much more worldly experience on her side to draw upon, I would judge the sibling's performance higher. But that's just nitpicking. The teacher and the co-students are good too. And they make the film lighter. The rest of the family does really well to make this slightly-more-than-a-month-in-the-life-of Mrs Godbole in Pune / New York shine in a warm familial glow.A couple of surprises in terms of guest appearances. On hindsight, one of them is an obvious one, given that R Balki's produced the movie.There is a nice balance to the struggle of restricting English dialogue in an English language setting for a largely Hindi audience in a mainstream Hindi movie. After all, it is a Bollywood movie, for everyone, including the person who has painted 'Ladis' and 'Gends' at the convenience near Byculla, which I happened to pass by in the morning. So the grammar lessons are few and far between, language is used to convey mood and feelings, not necessarily the exact content, and dialogue only when it's absolutely necessary.The cowering, lost woman transforms into a confident and self-aware person. That too without stretching the limits of believability. She doesn't suddenly become an orator in the newly learnt language. She doesn't lose her shyness either.Special mention here of Sridevi, she allows the director to lead her and doesn't overpower the narrative, with a held back, controlled performance. She could have tried to do a lot more, considering this was 'her' film, after like a zillion years.That is where the film hits you. It's real. You can easily identify with it. And is therefore that much more enjoyable.I don't have stars to dole out. Just hugs for the entire team, because, like many others know, it's not easy to make a good film. That too your first one, and at the same time having the guts to relaunch someone's career after many years.Excellent Vexellent." 
" Cute and Adorable Story","After long gap of 15 years Sridevi's flick has released.The story of movie is so cute.Family,friends anyone can watch this movie. The movie is about a married woman who doesn't know English language and has always been humiliated by her daughter,hubby and people around her.. Later she decides to learn it and teaches a lesson to all people who humiliated her because of not knowing English well. This flick makes you realize that 1.Don't ever accuse and make fun of people about their weakness who knows what they will be in future.. 2.Its you yourself who can make you learn and be successful.Don't rely on anyone not even on family members. 3.Family love is everything else is worthless." 
" Of Soulful Sentiment & Sunny Smiles","For someone who has been born and brought up on English medium schools, and I don't say this proudly, but for whom English is his first language of thought, it is very hard to put self in Sridevi's shoes. Someone, who doesn't know English, but in all other ways is very competent. Someone, who is constantly the butt of family jokes and jibes, especially by the husband and the rapidly growing daughter. That the film succeeds in making us feel her angst, and her ways of coping with it, showing the kind of situations she encounters, especially when she goes to New York, is a tribute to the story and the performances, especially the virtuoso acting masterclass by Sridevi, who shows, in more ways than one, that she's still got it !The debilitating effect of not knowing the language is brought alive by her mispronounciation of 'Jazz', a visit to her daughter's PTA, her solo trip to New York, handling immigration, her ordeal there buying coffee and various snide ones by both her husband ('She is born to make laddoo's') and her daughter ('Why did you take my book if you cant read ?'). Redemption arrives when she decides to take English lessons, while in New York, visiting her sister to help with her niece's wedding. She finds unlikely allies in the sister's house and a gallant, romantic French fellow student. And suddenly, life is not so bleak anymore. The film tries hard not to get too sentimental, balancing every tear with a chuckle or a smile. Amitabh Bachchan's delightful cameo, the other madcap students in the English class, none as zany as Salman Khan, the Pakistani, the cheerful nature of her son, her own special, sari-clad Michael Jackson impersonation, all serve to smoothen out the various trials and tribulations thrown her way. Sridevi makes you root for her, getting her every expression, every frown, every smile spot on. Most of the other characters are stereotypes – the busy, indifferent husband, the cute son, the gallant Gaul, the bombastic Pakistani etc. But she has shades to her character, moments of weakness followed by instances of strength. Waffling indecision followed by gutsy action. Isn't life about communication, rather than the language ? About the message, rather than the medium ? When / How did we get so snobbish about how different people speak, their accents. As the film rightly asks, why have we become so judgemental merely based on the persons attire, language ? Surely there is more to life than that ? More at www.apurvbollywood.blogspot.com" 
" English Vinglish:Sridevi is back,with a bang!","English Vinglish directed by Gauri Shinde is an outstanding movie.English Vinglish also marks the comeback of Sridevi,who plays the role of Shashi with bravura! Story: A belittled and insecure Indian housewife,Shashi (Sridevi) enrolls in an English language class.The movie's only drawback is the slow pacing.But yet,first-time director Gauri Shinde does an excellent job in making this movie a delightful one.The music is soothing.The cinematography is top-notch.The dialogs are well-worded The screenplay is water-tight.Performances: Sridevi rocks as Shashi!I feel that her performance must earn an National Award.If not at least a Film-fare Award.Kudos to her! Amitabh Bachchan,although in a cameo steals the show.The whole theater went berserk when Amitabh Bachchan makes his appearance.His comic timing is superb!He truly rocks! Adil Hussain is efficient.Navika Kotia and Shivansh Kotia as the children,act well.Cory Hibbs as David Fischer,Rajeev Ravindranathan as P.Ramamurthy,Ruth Aguilar as Eva,Damian Thompson as Udumbke and Sumeet Vyas as Salman Khan play their parts very well.Mehdi Nebbou as Laurent is good.All in all,English Vinglish is a must-watch for everyone.I am giving it a nine out of ten.Strongly Recommended!If you miss it,its your loss!" 
" I'm More Than a Laddu Maker!","For about the last 3 years, i have special interest with Indian movies. I found out that Indian movie is worth to watch, the idea of the story is original, based on India everyday life, problem, dilemma. I know Vinglish was something when I read about the plot. This is not about romance between two countries, love which separated by time and distance, unapproved love. This about a good housewife who was very loyal and serve her family entirely. Her name is Shashi. She had side job as a laddu maker (Indian traditional cake). But one thing which become a family joke all the time was her inability to speak English. A very obvious moment how embarrassed her daughter, Sapna, with her was when she should replaced her husband in school meeting (reports day). This the new information to me, in some schools in India, the daily language is English. Sashi unable talk in English and asked the teacher talked in Hindi, Sapna glared at her and refused talk to her on their way returned home. Not only Sapna, her husband, Sathish somehow disregarded her ability as a laddu maker only. Sashi asked by his sister to help her prepared her wedding's daughter in US, Sashi willing to help, but the consequence was she must leave by herself. The others family member would joined her later. Sashi was afraid because she unable speak English and this is the first time she left her home all by herself. But eventually she left. With full of happiness meeting her sister and nephew, Radha, she's still bothered about the embarrassment of her daughter and what her husband said. One day she saw an ad about learning English fluently on 6 weeks! Sashi showed her interest and memorized the number. She sign up herself for the program secretly. In this course she meet a cute French guy, Laurent, who helped her in the other day. He fancy her which was just too visible! Sashi enjoyed the class very much and followed the lesson well. She gained confidence and decided to follow the class till the end of the program. But Radha found out Sashi walked with Laurent, and asked who was he. Sashi revealed she took an English course and Radha supported her. Will Sashi finish her English course? Which one Sathi choose, Sathis or Laurent? You should find it by yourself by watching this humor-drama movie! Many scenes become my favorites, conversation between Amitabachan and American Immigration officer is one of. Gauri Shinde as a director, was very rigorous present it in a smart way, which is mostly I found in Hollywood movie. As an Indian movie, i gave you all my thumbs! :)" 
" Simply beautiful","Good things come in small packages, and "English vinglish" is the best example of that. In my opinion, one of the best ways to judge a movie is by how it makes you feel when you walk out of the theater. To sum-up the experience of watching 'English vinglish' in one word - Beautiful!I had the least expectations from a come-back movie of Sri Devi, but no one could have done a better job for this role. Sri Devi has the most realistic and lively expressions you will get to see in an actress. As my wifey puts it: "One of the most appealing characteristic of Sri Devi's acting is her ability to talk with her eyes", and you are going to see a lot of her eyes. Movie shows the ever-young face of Sri Devi for about 80-85% of the time, but you will never get bored of watching her or her "talking eyes". For all those people who wonder why Sri Devi still has a big fan following, this movie is the reason :-).The story of 'English vinglish' has a very nice flow to it. You are going to be surprised as to how simple the story is and what a brilliant job the creators have done to shape it into a master-piece. If not for the last scene, this movie would have scored the max points on my ratings, but kudos to the director for keeping it real. Putting aside the acting of Sri Devi, all the co-actors too have done an excellent job in keeping the movie entertaining. Not the mention the unexpected appearance of a guest Super-Star in the movie was a pleasant surprise too. But nothing beats the feeling of an "expected bad" movie turning into an awesome one.My suggestion: Perfect for family, couples, and friends, as there is something for everyone to take away from this movie. Just try to not focus on Sri Devi's surgically enhanced nose:-) (Bummer!)" 
" Cried twice when I watched in Morning and Evening when I played just the final speech","This post does NOT contain spoilers. after watching the movie I was legally obliged to write and IMDb review. I was watching Satya mev jayate end one of the guys there said that he was big sridevi fan. (most of people will remember this scene from SMJ) and sridevi came on stage. Now I realize his feelings in real. Don't get confused with first 10 minutes of movie. it starts a little slow but once you are accustomed with the voice of Sridevi (she is a bit squeaky and south Indian), you will be completely lost in the character of her. Side Roles are supream. Nice actors have been taken for roles. Loved the entire gang with Sridevi. finally a big crying bonanza comes for all of us Not shaven for days Males." 
" Beautiful film","I have seen this movie numerous times till date but tonight while I was watching it again, I felt a sudden urge to write a bit about this movie.English Vinglish is one of the most original, priceless movies to have come along in the recent past.A very big salute to Gauri to have written such a script and for the way Sridevi acted in this film. I am spellbound every time I watch it. There are so many scenes, so many of them in which you will be amazed by Sridevi's expressions.Each and every time I watch it, I love it all the more. English Vinglish emotes numerous feelings: Its about the purest form of love- a mother has for her children. The way she hugs her kid, attends the PTA, does the michael jackson dance, cries on leaving her family back home while traveling to US. Its about fighting your inner fears. Its about respecting your mother and so much more.The entire cast of the movie was superb. Her family and the members in her English class, all were outstanding. Amit Trivedi's music was fantastic and complemented the movie perfectly. Some dialogues were quite impressive especially "When you don't like yourself, you tend to dislike everything connected to you. New things seem to be more attractive. When you learn to love yourself, then the same old life starts looking new, nice." That is what life is and couldn't have been put in better words.At the end the only thing I would like to say is that this movie is very close to my heart. Its one of the most refreshing movies you will ever come across and it will leave you with a big smile on your face. And lastly, she deserved the best actress award that year, every bit of it. I am not saying that others didn't deserve, but Sridevi's performance was at par with the rest. Till date whenever I watch this movie I feel extremely disappointed for her not receiving the best actress award for English Vinglish." 
" A very heart touching and beautiful story","when i heard about this movie....i was damn sure that the movie will rock & thats all we can expect from Sridevi...... well written and beautifully directed and acted Drama.....far better than boring Hindi love stories. Thump UP :) In actual many people from Pakistan and India are suffering from the same problem in their houses, offices, and in other gathering. i am glad that the writer addressed this issue through this movie.. my most favorite character from this movie are EVA and Salman Khan both Characters made me laugh many many time..... (I eva.....I Come Mehico.....lolzzzzzzz).. A complete Family movie with no vulgarism....Great Work..." 
" A Wonderful Inspiring Story With A Breakout Actress!!!","Sridevi is back from well over a decade hiatus to critical acclaim in this story that brings old traditions to the modern world. The story of an Indian woman who ends up in New York City and struggles to learn the English language while dealing with a society who is less than tolerable is a touching theme. The script conveyed the issues of what a stranger in a foreign land deals with so naturally you feel the characters insecurities and pain. The cinematography, score and production quality captured the spirit of New York City and pulled you into the heart of the film.The supporting cast was extremely talented but the breakout star of this film was Yu Son played by Maria Romano. Ms. Romano lit up the screen and her performance stole the scenes. A true young starlet in the making and I would like to thank the director Gauri Shinde personally for recognizing such talent. The movie was wonderful but see this film if only to get your first glimpse of Maria Romano and see what the future of Hollywood will be!!!" 
" The Queen Has Returned","If creative intellectuals have their way, when the history of Indian Cinema is written, it will be written in two parts: Before Sridevi and After Sridevi. With due respect to Dilip Kumar, Kamal Hassan, and even Amitabh Bachchan, Sridevi stands as the sole female actor in a country whose native cinema has historically preferred its women to be little more than ornamental showpieces to equal and even generally outrank and outshine her male counterparts by building a legacy that is as artistically rich as it is historically significant.She has achieved every benchmark befitting a historic thespian who is now commonly referred to as "India's Meryl Streep": as the only Indian actor (male or female) to have achieved supremacy in every major regional language of the World's Largest Film Industry, her return to the silver screen is not one that can go unnoticed. This is, to put it mildly, The Return of the Queen.And now, at age 49, she reinvents the wheel yet again, giving audiences reluctant to view women past the age of 35 as anything other than matronly spinsters a fully existential view of middle-aged femininity that is somber, sweet, and wholly unlike anything Indian cinema has ever dared to say about women of a certain age. Fifteen years after her last film, Judaai (in which she triumphantly played a materialistic husband-selling virago), she returns to the big screen with a difficult but simple story of a middle class housewife named Shashi who finds her life, relationships, and identity limited by the fact that she cannot speak English. Summoned to New York by her sister to help with the preparations for her niece's upcoming wedding, Shashi finds herself confronted with ideas, customs, and individuals that, while foreign, are not wholly alien to her. She doesn't mind that strangers offer her wine on planes, or that gay couples stroll hand in hand on the Upper West Side. Shashi should be a narrow-minded and provincial simpleton. She is, instead, a warm and accepting woman with a heart of gold who simply doesn't know the language of the world. Or does she? Like all Sridevi creations, Shashi is complex in both her design and her ambition. Unlike all other Sridevi creations, however, Shashi is firmly rooted in reality. Sridevi has almost exclusively been held to the larger than life standard that has enabled her to play some of the most unique and legendary characters ever enacted by any actress, Indian or otherwise. As Mani Ratnam famously said in 1995, "Asking Sridevi to play the typical heroine role is like asking Picasso to paint your wall." With due respect to Picasso's creative process, Sridevi is able to conjure miracles in seconds. Shashi has no grand designs on life. Her only desire is to be taken seriously, to know that she is as important as her family members that converse and operate in English when at the office or at school. For her, there is no tragic event that becomes the impetus for her desire to learn English. It is the cumulative effect of a thousand petty humiliations, borne upon her face day after day, as she is derided, diminished, and dismissed as being less than. Shashi knows that she is capable and intelligent; her mind is as open as her heart; and yet no one will take her seriously.Despite the supporting cast's best efforts, all of the film would be for naught were it not for the heart-poundingly delicate performance from Sridevi who elevates the film as only a master can. That Sridevi is a world-class thespian does not need to be repeated. What does bear pointing out is the utterly flawless way in which Sridevi communicates Shashi's building frustration with her linguistic limitations at every moment when she is derided or disdained by her daughter, husband, or random strangers abroad. It becomes clear to Shashi that no one – not even her loved ones – view her as an individual. She is only to be considered in terms of her social relations- as wife, mother, homemaker. That she is an existential being in her own right, with her own desires and ambitions, is something only Shashi asserts, albeit in complete silence. The look of muted broken heartedness that Sridevi conjures at every slight is something to behold: she swallows her humiliations with bitterness, unsure that this is the way things are supposed to be. Sridevi's frankly perfect performance gives rise to more than just her second innings as an actor: it heralds the beginning of a new Golden Age in Hindi Cinema.Such expectations aside, critics and Sridevi fanatics alike have all been asking the same question: where does her portrayal of Shashi rank among her legendary performances? Is it of the caliber of her greatest achievements Sadma, Chaalbaaz, Mr. India, and Lamhe? Does it deserve the same consideration of her landmark work in movies like Chandni, Gumrah, and Laadla? All I can positively assert without any hesitation is that Sridevi's Shashi allows her to produce a fine and finessed performance that is unassuming and wise at the same time. Sridevi has long been "afflicted" by the demand that she play only grandiose women. Even "ordinary" women like Chandni became larger-than-life purely because Sridevi was playing them. Her very essence speaks to the isolated, the elevated, and the unique. As R. Balki has recently said of Sridevi, an actress of her ability is born but once in a thousand years, and that she must continue to act, not only for the sake of her own career but for the sake of cinema itself. Some artists are their medium in such definitive ways that their absence means a weakening of the entire medium itself. Sridevi is, almost 50 years since the beginning of her career, the purest distillation of Acting India has ever known. And if the 15 years since Judaai are any indication, she will remain thus."
