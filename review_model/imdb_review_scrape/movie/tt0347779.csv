" Excellent!","Pinjar is a genuinely good film, with great acting, good narrative, good presentation, touching emotions, etc.It seems to me that the quality of films that Bollywood is producing is quite improving these days, and this film is one evidence.No Bollywood movie that I can remember of made such an impact on me - I was literally thinking about the movie for hours - marvelling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human.The film rests on the great acting of Urmilla Matondkar, and also some from Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in North India in the background of the partition, and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face. A must-see film. A technically superior Bollywood product, which I feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world." 
" In a word...amazing.","In a word...amazing.I initially was not too keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan. I was so totally wrong. Pinjar is a heart-wrenching, emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws. I was haunted by it after watching it. It lingered on my mind for so long; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion- all was so real.This is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in Bollywood nowadays. It has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story. Here, no one country is depicted as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunting. Everything about the movie was amazing...and the acting just took my breath away. All were perfectly cast.If you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie...look no further. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. AMAZING cannot describe how excellent it is." 
" Different Bollywood","Many of the reviewers have made it a point to note that Pinjar is unlike the run of the mill films produced in Bollywood. While this is true, Bollywood films in general are geared to a specific audience and should be appreciated for accomplishing their aims in this regard.However,Pinjar is an excellent film for those seeking a change from the normal equation based Bollywood film. Set during the time of Partition between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focuses on a Punjabi girl who becomes the victim of societal and cultural attitudes toward the treatment of women in her time. Paro, the protagonist, is forced to choose between a life with a man who has abducted her and the fleeting hope of a life with her family back in Indian ruled Punjab. More than an issue of Hindus and Muslims, Pinjar addresses and defines a woman's role as a daughter, as a wife, and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike typical Bollywood films which are escapist in nature, Pinjar is a film that makes its audience contemplate these issues during and after the film." 
" Breathtaking and deeply emotional saga...(keep a box of tissues handy though)","Pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard. Set in Partition India, this film Shows the true reality of partition India. Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go. Her freedom, personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over a tragic land dispute. Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her remorseful abductor. There several moments in the film where one is brought to tears. The film at points is deeply traumatic. Some of the partition scenes are spine chilling, yet Urmila's endurance and survival are both remarkable. From a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. A remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling." 
" A movie for the thinking public","I was haunted for days after watching this movie. Spent several nights tossing and turning. What makes this movie stand out is the authenticity. Since the movie is based on a novel by Amrita Pritam, a woman who experienced the trauma of partition first hand, the original story was bound to have a soul. Add to that Dwivedi's penchant for perfection, and we have a classic.Urmila's relation with Manoj Bajpai, and the way it evolves, could not have been portrayed more authentically. The guilt on Manoj Bajpai's face makes your heart reach out to him. You want to go there and console him, tell him its not his fault.Lilette Dubey's lullaby (original poetry by Amrita Pritam), can bring tears to the eyes. The scene where Urmila self aborts or the one where she tries to wash away the tattoo from her hand, stand out. The way she rescues Sandhali Sinha brings a sad smile to your face. And the climax is so poignant, there are no words to describe it.This movie should have been India's official entry for the Oscars and should have participated in each and every film festival anywhere in the world. In fact, Amrita Pritam deserves a Nobel prize for this one. I have never seen a better Bollywood movie, and don't think ever will." 
" remarkably different","A very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam. Urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best.there is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through. It looked like bollywood finally gave away it's glamor and had some quality artists performing on screen.Content wise, the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in one's life goes beyond religion.The best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and melodrama.I simply loved it." 
" a modern day classical art epic","wow wow wow wow wowThis unquestionable loss of words is what I felt like when I saw Pinjar. Going in not expecting anything from the movie was a good way to stay objective, but having watched it, it really makes you think of all the suffering and torment that went on during partition. Being born and brought up in the west, one tends to forget the pain and the struggle that our forefathers and mothers must have gone through. I would have to quote this as one of the most serious art movie that bollywood has made in some time. Although in my view an art movie, it managed to churn out wonderful cinematography, narration, characters and pace. Before this movie I was very dismissive of Urmila and this had made me change my view on her acting capabilities. A definite movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon with a nice cup of chai." 
" Finally, a sincere movie on the Indo-Pak issue","This movie was absolutely wonderful.  The pre-partition time and culture has been recreated beautifully.  Urmila has given yet another brilliant performance.  What I truly admire about this movie is that it doesn't resort to Pakistan-bashing that is running rampant in movies like Gadar and LOC. With the partition as a backdrop, the movie does not divert to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong.  The movie always centers around the tragic story of Urmila's life.  Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been depicted excellently.  The movie actually shows how the people, both Hindus and Muslims, have suffered from this partition. The theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film." 
" Movie for people with brains !!!!","If you like movies with any sense and leave movies like Kal Ho Na Ho and Main Hoon Na for dodos then this is the movie for you. The movie shows the real plight suffered by the people from both side of the border during partition without being biased. There are no chest-thumping dialogues that make your blood boil. But instead it has sensible script that makes you think on whatever happened during partition was it really necessary.
All the cast has put a commendable performances. The director has done a stupendous job first by selecting a topic so volatile and then portraying it in such a beautiful way. Hats off SIR!!!! Over all a fantastic movie!!!! Rating 9 out of 10.PS: Here I would like to make a point to the people who make & watch movies like Kal Ho Na Ho, Main Hoon Na, Kaho Na Pyaar Hai. What are you trying to achieve by making & watching eye-candies that don't have any sense. Because of these kind of brainless and baseless movies, good movies like Pinjar goes unnoticed. I think its time for people to decide who deserves more credit Pinjar or Main Hoon Na?????" 
" If you haven't seen this film, you need to.","I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here. I'm relatively new to Bollywood films and was born and raised in the US. So I don't have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar to other Indian films. Luckily, no comparison is needed.Pinjar stands on its own as nothing less than a masterpiece.In one line I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio anywhere at any time. On a mass-appeal scale, it *could* have been the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" had it been adequately promoted in the US. This could very well have been the film that put Bollywood on the American map. The American movie-going public has a long-standing love affair with "Gone With the Wind", and while Pinjar doesn't borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities. Not the least of which is the whopping (by US standards) 183-minute run time.Set against the gritty backdrop of the India-Pakistan partition in 1947-48 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating. Put into an untenable position, she somehow manages to not only survive, but to grow -- and even flourish.If the story is lacking in any way, it's in the exposition. Puro's (the protagonist) growth as a person would be better illustrated -- at least for western audiences unfamiliar with Indian culture -- if her character's "back story" were more fully developed in the early part of the film. But that would have stretched a 3-hour movie to 3 1/2 hours or perhaps even more. Because not one minute of the film is wasted, and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time. Better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains.I could use many words to describe Pinjar: "poignant", "disturbing", "compelling", "heart-wrenching" come to mind immediately. But "uplifting" is perhaps as apropos as any of those. Any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such. And Puro's triumph -- while possibly not immediately evident to those around her -- is no less than inspirational. For strength of story alone I cannot recommend this film highly enough.Equally inspiring is Urmila Matondkar's portrayal of Puro. All too often overlooked amid the bevy of younger, newer actresses, Urmila has the unique capability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays. She doesn't merely act Puro's part, she breathes life into the character. Manoj Bajpai's selection as Rashid was inspired. He manages something far too few Indian film heroes can: subtlety. His command of expression and nuance is essential to the role. He brings more menace to the early part of the film with his piercing stare than all of the sword-wielding rioters combined.If you only see one Bollywood film in your life, make it Pinjar." 
" One of the best!","I have been a Hindi movie buff since the age of 4 but never in my life have a watched such a moving and impacting movie, especially as a Hindi film. In the past several years, I had stopped watching contemporary Hindi movies and reverted to watching the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.) But this movie changed everything. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I found it not only to be moving but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation Indian woman growing up in America. It helped me to understand my own family history, which was always something very abstract to me. But, to "see" it, feel it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that Indian people endured. The film helped to put many things into perspective for me, especially considering the current world events. I never thought that a movie could change the way I think like this before... it did. The plot is fantastic, the acting superb and the direction is flawless. Two thumbs up!" 
" Best of Best","I don't have words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could have written such a real depiction of the days of partition. The movie kept haunting me for many days.Urmila did the role of her life in this movie. She put life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did no less in his role as Rashid. It is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of Puroo and Rashid. The Punjabi costumes looked so natural on Urmila and Manoj looked like a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan.Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did fabulous job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did good work as Triloki.Some of the scenes you just can't get out of your mind. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, it brings tears to your eyes. The climax is just killer. I was expecting a tragic ending but thankfully, the ending was wonderful.This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras etc. Not to be missed." 
" A sad commentary on Hindu psyche","Superb. I had initially thought that given Amrita Pritam's communist leanings and Dr Dwivedi's nationalist leanings film will be more frank than novel but when I read the novel I was surprised to find that it was reverse.Kudos to marita Pritam for not being pseudo-sec and to Dr Dwivedi to be objective. This movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way. Casualty of any war are women as some poet said and this movie personifies it. It is also a sad commentary on Hindu psyche as they can't stand up against kidnappers of their girls or the Hindu Brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor. On the other hand it also shows economic angles behind partition or in fact why girls were kidnapped in the first place. I think kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls they Will become legal owners of the houses and thus new govt. will not be able to ask them to return the houses. This apart one has to salute the courage of characters of Puro and her Bhabhi they are two simple village girls unmindful of outside world and risk everytihng by trying to come back after being dishonored . Because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in India.No wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women." 
" very well-made, and difficult to watch","This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer".In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off." 
" The best","Can't tell you how good and heart rendering this movie is. The cast, the simplicity, the story, the tragedy, the longing, the perspective from both the side of the border, no jingoism, the songs and especially the ghazal- "Haath chuthe bhi toh rishte nahe chutha karte...", the screenplay, etc.
Don't miss it..." 
" Pinjar is a movie adaptation from novel Pinjar by Amrita Pritam","Pinjar is a novel written by Amrita Pritam, writer and senior journalist Khushwant Singh has edited it in English. Amrita Pritam has been the first women writer in Independent India who has extensively wrote on themes of partition, national harmony, women and grassroots issues of Punjab. Khushwant Singh, the contemporary of Amrita Pritam who shares the same view. Khushwant Singh also has written books like The Train to Pakistan and many other books on Partition, national harmony and social issues. Chandra Prakash Dwivedi a television director turned film director has made his debut film Pinjar in 2003. This film is adaptation from Novel to Cinema. Film focuses on a girl character Pooro and her life. It narrates the tragic tale of partition and Pooro's life. Amrita Pritam the prominent Indian writer who has witnessed the partition and has lived in undivided Punjab province has seen the ups and downs of many lives. We find Pinjar as objective correlative of Amrita Pritam. Pinjar is a film of objective co-relativity of Amrita Pritam, J A Cuddon has written the definition of objective co-relativity in Dictionary of Literary terms, "The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an 'objective correlative'; in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked. According to Salma Malik (assistant professor from Islamabad), "All Partition films broadly belong to the genre of historical films. They narrate Partition as the novel. They seem like historical narratives with particular ideologies. They prove to be a film version for national histories." Pinjar is a partition film which goes much beyond the pangs of partition 1947 and touches the lives of people across the border. As the province of Punjab faced and witness the trauma of Partition, the writers belongs to this region responded in their writing. Punjabi novels have a long list of writers like, Nanak Singh's Khoon De Sohle (1947),and Mazdhaar (1949). Amrita Pritam's Pinjar (1948), Bhairav Prasad Gupta's, Bhagwaticharan Verma's Bhule-Bisre Chitra (1961), Vishnu Prabhakar's, Nishikant (1958), Kamleshwar's, Laute Hue Musaphir (1971), Bhisham Sahni's Tamas (1973), Yashpal's Meri Teri Uski Baat (1974) and Zootha Sach (1969), Ramanand Sagar's Aur Insaan Mar Gaya (1948), Rahi Masoom Raza's Aadha Gaon (1966), and Os Ki Bund, Acharya Chatur Shastri's Dharam Putra are some of the widely acclaimed works. These novels narrated many heart-wrenching stories of abductions and rapes during Partition. Writers like Khwaja Ahmad Abbas' narrated it in Revenge. Manto's wrote it in the Reunion and Toba Tek Singh and Bedi's Lajwanti. Today we refer to their books, novels, dramas to study as historic references. Amrita Pritam's Pinjar portrays the character of 'Puro' with her existential dilemma of women during the Partition. It is reflected at community and individual level. Puro, a Hindu girl abducted by Rasheed, a Muslim guy. Abandoned by her family, she finally accepts her fate and settles in Pakistan. During the chaos of Partition, Puro grows on psychological plane, we find her reaction after her Muslim name(Hamida) is tattooed on her hand, the same tattooed name help her while saving Laajo. This proves the growth of a character of Puro. Puro (Hamida) finally chooses to stay with Rashid in Pakistan. This point proves the secular spirit of nationals Somdatta Mandal (Professor of English & Head. Department Shantiniketan) discusses these similarities in detail in her Film and Fiction: Word into Image. She begins saying, "handling of time and space plays important role in film and fiction, the use of flashback and flash forward is potential tool of focusing and event." Amrita Pritam's Pinjar and the film begins with central character Puro, We focus on her action and go in flashback, and it starts with her adolescent age and ends in tragic. The use of flashback is mostly for 'dreams' or 'streams of consciousness. Pinjar film and novel has linear narration, events and episodes unfold in chronological manner. Theorists like George Bluestone calls film as a combination of space/time art and Prose fiction immortalize the time as art. "The novel renders from point to point in space". (1966:61) As both films and novels follow determined sequence to unfold the events. These art forms develop "plot", sub plot and characters to push the story further." Pinjar movie develops and follows the character of Puro closely, Rashid, abductor and husband character id developed over the events takes place in movie. The progress of Rashid character from an abductor, husband, caring family person, companion to philanthropic is a journey we witness in Pinjar. The character of Puro and her love towards family remains intact, even though she is been abandoned by her father and mother. This particular offers us the glimpses of the culture and sociology. Pinjar is a movie adaptation from novel Pinjar by Amrita Pritam. Film is based on Indian partition 1947. The character of Puro plays vital role in the movie. Film narrates the historical milieu of undivided India. This paper has analyzed how the adaptation of novel to film holds strong essence of novel. Pinjar as a move passes strong message of national integrity, social harmony and humanity. Undivided India had secular society and some fanatics who had their vested interests. Movie has portrayed history with unbiased point of view. The message of secular society goes strong with the liberal characters like Puro, Ramchand, Lajjo, Trilok the new generation. This film is a best example of historical reference for national integrity, social harmony and secular society."
