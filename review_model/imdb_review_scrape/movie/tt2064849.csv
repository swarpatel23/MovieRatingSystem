" Worth a watch for few!!","Contrived after Before Sunrise and Before Sunset is an enjoyable movie but missed "the perfect milestone" by few miles. Movie is one of it's kind which will either be loved or hated (not for those who love run off mill Rom - Com). Surely you will notice a nagging feeling of "it could have been just a little bit better(not much, but just teeny weeny better)" to each encounter between the couple, that's because the director was racing against the clock, desperate to emulate too much of Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. The leads did justice to their roles.The breezy vibe and the crackling chemistry between the duo is splendid and the humor, isn't of the laugh-out-loud variety, but includes some clever zingers. The spontaneous outburst from Ali in a climax scene in New York is superbly written and nicely performed. Watch it for its freshness and you won't be bored." 
" A very non Bollywood film, and a must watch film a very good entertainer....","London Paris New York is a film about 2 Indians,Nikhil (Ali Zafar) and Lalitha (Aditi Rao Hydari) who meet in London and spend a good time together and they start feeling for each other but due to some reason they had to apart. after few year's they met in Paris and felt it for each other but thing's don't go well and they apart again.Their story ends in New york. The first half of film is very entertaining and it makes you laugh a lot where as the second half is more romantic and dramatic. Ali Zafar and Aditi rao have shared a good chemistry kin the film and both were really superb in their roles, Aditi rao was very hot and sexy while Ali safari was also looking good and both acted very well especially Ali safari's acting at the scene at before end where he express his feelings to Lalitha. The music is very good and it really go well with the tempo of the film. and finally the work of Anu Manon as director was really impressive and she is a much better director than her acting skill's. unlike usual Bollywood romantic film L.P.N.Y is not very lengthy and it is a promising entertainment and a must watch film.." 
" The Way Love Stories Should Be Made","Romantic comedies or Rom-coms are not a new genre. Love stories have been told in the past too and will be told in the future. Every rom-com has a bit of predictability in it but still every now and then, a 'Jab We Met' comes. A film which has that special visual treatment, powerful performances, gratifying moments and a good feel to them. London Paris New York (LPNY) is one of those special films.Set in three lovely cities of the world and spread over more than half a decade, LPNY is a story of Nikhil (Ali Zafar) a happy-go-lucky charming boy and Lalitha (Aditi Rao Hyderi) a simple, nerdy Madrasi girl falling in love with each other thrice in six years.And that's it.That's all LPNY is. No impediments, no pretentiousness, no preaching, no 'zaalim samaaj' and even no supporting cast. The only third person with a line to say is Dilip Tahil who appears in the last ten minutes of the film.The first few looks of the film give an impression that it has shades of 'When Harry Met Sally' which has already been done in Bollywood (Hum Tum), however, LPNY is a different story with a different treatment. In fact, it's closer to '500 Days of Summer' and also has a peculiar similarity with 'Rodger Dodger' because of its heavy dependence on dialogue between only two main characters. Nonetheless, LPNY is a lot simpler than any of these movies. Instead of relying on twists and complications of the plot, it thrives on performances and the affability of the lead characters.It's a short film of less than two hours, one of the strongest points of the film because of which it does not drag at any point and is fairly gripping for a simple story. The first story of London is a bit tacky and one takes some time to get comfy with the characters specially the extrovert Nikhil. As the story moves forward, the entertainment and audience engagement bars go up. Paris story is better than London and then New York wins from Paris hands down. The climax is beautiful. Watch out for the penultimate sequence at Hudson River; best scene of the movie. The film could have finished at that point and it would have ended at a high second to no other love story of recent times. No complains though.Ali Zafar is dynamite. 5,000 tons of talent. Besides being the lead actor in the film, he is the music director, singer and lyricist as well. While he has done well on all the fronts; acting still takes the cake. In Tere Bin Laden, you were convinced on his comic timing but needed convincing on his ability to handle emotional scenes as TBL had none. LPNY has shown the audience his flexibility, range and ability to carry the film on his shoulders. He shows his emotional side and what a show this has been. His comic timing in London segment, impatience in Paris and outburst at the climax in New YorkÂ… fantastic performance. Amazing screen presence and charm.Aditi Rao Hyderi is not far behind either. Her portrayal of Lalitha and transformation the character goes through are extremely natural hence authentic. Her adorably shy demeanor in the first story, sultry looks and heartbreak in the second and mature conduct in the third are absolutely brilliant. Her best performance after smaller roles in 'Yeh Saali Zindagi' and 'Rockstar'. She looks gorgeous in rain sequence in London and steals the hotel room scene in Paris which of course is a defining moment in the story too.The third star of the film is Anu Menon. Anu too has worn multiple hats for the film. She has written the script, directed it and has also written the dialogues. Had I not known, I would have thought LPNY is an Imtiaz Ali film and that's a huge compliment for Anu. Her aesthetic senses deserve applause for the way he has handled intimate scenes between the lead pair. The story has been kept simple, narration even simpler while dialogues put soul in the film. They do get cheesy at times but that is the requirement for Nikhil's character build-up. Anu hasn't gone over the top and has kept the film as close to reality as possible. If there is a term 'Unrealistically Realistic', it fits LPNY. I can swear several guys have gone through what Nikhil goes through on the bench in London. Yes, it's that real. She also deserves credit for keeping the film short, not going beyond two hours by dragging the film needlessly. The credit for this should also go to the debutant editor Sally Salgoanker.LPNY is exactly the way love stories should be made. Trendy, Urban and fairly realistic. It takes great courage to make an entire film for only two characters, played by new comers and that too a talkie one. Even if it does not win bumper opening at the box office, it will increase the audience size for Ali, Aditi and Anu significantly. A beautifully made artsy commercial film which deserves a successful run." 
" Beautiful Movie","Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.It would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.The balance between reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.The characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense.Once again awesome job to the rang London Paris New York Team ." 
" A Contemporary Indian Love Story Journeys across 3 cities.","London, Paris and New York: I absolutely love the way Ali Zafar talks and is easy on the eyes too. Aditi Hydary plays the middle class girl next door to the T. The story which starts in London and concludes in New York is of a guy who wears his heart on his sleeves and is not afraid to dive into love/relationship but is constantly met with reluctances and inhibitions of a middle class girl. The f...un is in the journey that these two take while discovering each other's nature, background, interests, future plans and feelings for each other. The contemporariness of the script makes it relevant and enjoyable and the hummable sing along songs add to the fun. My fav is "Voh Dekhne Mein". Liked the movie and recommend the rom-com for an evening out." 
" a fresh love tale.","I don't know much about business, but that doesn't mean it's hard to appreciate a good romantic movie describing the relationship of two different individuals. it is the far better movie from recent love stories of bollywood.story is old but theme is new. movie centered around only two characters & director handle story very well never loose grip on story. screenplay a major plus point of movie. direction is also good. actors did their job well.whole movie has but i promise after watching this you will not be disappointed. it will be good one & half one hour. dude this deserve a watch.just because it don't have stars like srk & kareena doesn't get much of hype." 
" Smug, repellent,and disturbingly bad.","This film thinks it's a whole lot smarter than it is. Trotting out the hoary, smug idea about how small towns are stultifying and full of stupid people is the least of its problems. Everything in it rings utterly false. The most slowly paced, and depressing movie I have seen this year. Every moment of almost every scene was composed of non-stop cringing and the entire audience hiding their faces in their hands. Of all the films I have ever seen, none has ever had a more unlikeable or irredeemable script. This was clearly the intent and to this end the actual acting was pretty good, but it did nothing to make the film any more watchable.The most annoying part is the performance of the female lead,Ali Zafar was pretty good,but Aditi Rao Hydari ruined the chemistry.My recommendation, in a nutshell, is don't touch this one with a barge pole. Seriously, do not be tempted- life is short, and you'll never get these 2 hrs back.Oh- unless you're the sort of person who likes to laugh at stupid jokes. If you do, maybe you'll enjoy this movie, but judging by my fellow viewers' sighs and groans of disgust and disbelief you will be one of few. Overall : 2/10" 
" London Paris NEW YORK: Rather than roaming the world, your house is the best place to be !","Bollywood can treat you with a 'Kahaani' and at the same time, it can delude you with 'London Paris NewYork'. This movie is a very bad attempt (to say the least) to recreate 'Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset' (which were both quite good).The movie is about a film- maker Nikhil Chopra (Ali Zafar) who is a typical rich guy with inherited wealth from his family. He meets Aditi aka Lalita at London airport and they spend the day & night together. They promise to meet in New York after 6 months. 2 years later, we are in Paris. Nikhil is here to find her and they meet in one of the pubs where she has changed from a geek to someone who has breathed the Western air. If you have seen the movie till here, you have done the hard part. We are at intermission.The second half begins well. After spending the night in Paris, Aditi ditches Ali. She tells about her journey from NY to London, just to see him with someone else in bed. She believes this is her revenge and will destroy Ali the way it destroyed her. Here we feel we have some justice to the pathetic first half. Few years later, we are in NY. Ali is here to meet Aditi and they spend another night together. The next morning when they wake up, Aditi is to marry a new guy Alan. Ali cant believe it. How I wish, this was the end.. but Bollywood HAS to have a happy ending and you know what happens next.Ali Zafar can't stop over acting and Aditi Rao portrays herself as a complete rookie..The songs are a complete let down.. You are better of watching a nonsensical comedy like 'Ready' where at least you have Salman Khan to look at. This one's even worse ! AVOID in caps." 
" stupid movie","who the stupid made this movie, she should be barred from making movies, don't watch the stupidest movie ever, waste of money and time.Hot on the heels of "Ek Deewana Tha" and "Ek Main AurEkkTu", both romantic dramas aiming at urban audience, "London Paris New York" has Ali Zafaras Nikhil Chopra, who when we first meet him, aspires to be a filmmaker.At London airport, he meets-cute Lalitha Krishnan (Aditi Rao Hydari), a young woman with an amateurish outlook on feminism and politics â€“ and whose maturity never levels up in the film's passage of time.In their first meeting, highlighted by two very long steadicam-takes, one notices a spark gradually, and innocently, developing between Nikhil and Lalitha.She has missed her connecting flight to New York and Nikhil, on his first day of un-parented "freedom", suggests they spend her remaining time adventuring through London. So like backpackers, they ride up the city, get soaked in the rain and have a few glasses of wine.A few years later, in 2007, they do this exercise again in Paris. Nikhil now sports a goatee and Lalitha has chopped her hair. The two also have a brewing conflict about infidelity, the reason for which I found lacking. They, of course, separate â€” again.Finally years later, today, Nikhil, now a filmmaker, tracks down Lalitha and they spend another night in New York oblivious to the severity of their differences. If anything, fracases are painlessly, contended in this story.Yes, "London Paris New York" is a variation of "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset", with three episodes packed into little more than 90 minutes. However, there's a transparent dissimilarity between the two. Even with a short running time, this film's screenplay (also credited to Anu Menon), forgets to add any spontaneity to its plot.The London bit starts out welcomingly fresh, where both characters are guided by their youthful convictions. When they do grow up, two years later, their lives are a train-wreck of misguided adulthood. By the time New York happens, we see the film pacing itself for a climax, and little else.Despite Ali Zafar's alluring on-screen personality, and his monotonous-sounding voice with the slight Punjabi-drawl, we never build a connection with Nikhil. Lalitha, sheepish and misguided by the pragmatism of her nature, is even more departed to our emotions."London Paris New York" has seven tracks on its album, with Music and Lyrics predictably by Ali Zafar. The soundtrack is a snug fit within the overall structure of the film. They, almost never, interrupt the flow of the story.With his third major Bollywood feature, I can safely assume that Ali Zafar is now a bona fide Bollywood commodity. There's obvious, untapped, star-power here and this raw resource puts him right up there with the best of Bollywood's next generation.Like "Tere Bin Laden" â€“ the finest work in his current resume â€“ one can spot the work he's molded into his character. Ali Zafar has a definite Pakistani naturalness to his performance. Despite our shared heritage, there's a vivid contrast between our body languages, and this gradient uniquely deviates him from what we expect of Bollywood leads." 
" An unintelligent mess inspired from two extremely intelligent foreign classics.","As mentioned earlier in one of my recent reviews, here is another film made on the same low cost recipe of Bollywood which has more chances of recovering its cost featuring two fresh faces. Posing as a new age romantic comedy with few bold dialogues and novel sequences, London Paris NEW YORK once again follows the same old process of presenting before the audience a smart interesting dish, inspired from two great English Classics, adding the usual unavoidable Bollywood ingredients in it for a clichÃ©d climax.But here, few friends may like to support this movie with their argument that "How many of us have seen the Originals, so at least they are giving us something new." And in answer to their point raised, I would like to give my honest but strong opinion in the following words. LPNY revolves around only two main characters who become love birds as the time progresses and then in the end they realize that they were actually made for each other. The story basically talks about their meetings in three cities under different situations or time spans and the script largely relies on their mutual conversations alone to amuse the viewer. Now this whole concept of two people meeting each other in a journey, roaming around the city together and then parting with a promise to meet at a certain date is all taken from the two English masterpieces made in sequels. And they are BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) and BEFORE SUNSET (2004) directed by Richard Linklater featuring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in the lead.As an individual project, London Paris NEW YORK can be called a sweet film which tries to be extra ordinary in its first hour and then simply gives away to the routine path in the end. Many of the youngsters may like it due to the bold dialogues written realistically, its fine performances by Ali-Aditi and its few hummable songs composed & sung by Ali Zafar himself.But in frank words, what this film does to a sincere cinema lover (eager to watch all the well made classics in the entire world)Â…Â…Â…Â….is nothing less than a SIN!Why? Because London Paris NEW YORK simply snatches away all those surprises, thrills, love, sensuality, intelligence, intellect and magic which one can feel watching its two originals in their virginity. In other words, now after watching LPNY if you try watching the two movies mentioned above then you will never be able to enjoy them or feel them in the way you could have, as a surprise viewer. The Bollywood version clearly ruins the "Out of this world Experience" of watching these two classics which is nothing less than a SIN if seen from the eyes of a passionate cinema lover.Truly speaking I rate both BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) and BEFORE SUNSET (2004) as one of the best movies made till date in the World Cinema, especially for those who don't just watch, but like to study the films made with such rare conviction. These two movies have the power to teach you love as an unexplained phenomenon, which has its own unlimited dimensions. They can teach you the value of relationships as never before and can enlighten your deep thinking patterns bringing in more clarity or understanding in your personal real life love affairs.As a commercial venture, directed by the debutant Anu Menon, London Paris NEW YORK should turn out to be a safe bet, preferably in the metros. The director shows the sparks in the execution but if only the writers could have stayed away from the routine ending, the film would have been at least a little close to its originals. However at present its miles away from its actual sources and is not able to give you even a sip of that delicious drink offered by the two masterpieces. It neither impresses you as a thoughtful love story nor is able to leave a mark through its borrowed intellect shown in its few sequences.Still considering it in a positive manner, if you have seen London Paris NEW YORK and liked it even partially then treat this Indian version as a loving invitation to the world of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, the couple admiring each other. And if you haven't seen this new Bollywood release till now but the narration does excite you then before watching it, essentially go for BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) and BEFORE SUNSET (2004) as a must like an emergency. Because watching these two classics without having any preset notions about their actual content is something beyond explanation and imagination.In the end though this is a write-up on London Paris NEW YORK which is unarguably an unintelligent mess inspired from two extremely intelligent foreign classics. Yet I would like to use it to inform all lovers and cinema freaks here, about these two precious gems, which should not be missed or delayed at any cost.So if you are a lover or have felt the true love ever in your entire past then do watch BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) and BEFORE SUNSET (2004) both, like an essential medication for your precious life. London Paris NEW YORK might be cute in its own limited way but director Richard Linklater's two babies really talk about something of the BEYOND..............which cannot be copied ever." 
" It's Surprisingly Wonderful","The movie starts out on a simple note and starts to gain momentum. The script for some reason is purely brilliant even though the movie has been inspired from two Hollywood flicks 'Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset'. Ali Zafar manages to pull off his role rather well and brings a substantial amount of depth to his character while Aditi Rao is deep and profound. Her character goes through various phases and she pulls them through with sheer brilliance. The movie gets sort of irritating post the interval but the irritation is short lived. Good songs and cinematography add to the overall experience. Believe me it's worth a watch if you want to watch a purely romantic love story. But only if you haven't watched Before Sunrise and Before Sunset." 
" London Paris New York is average","Coming-of-age films have become the current craze in Bollywood. So after the recently released Ek Main Aur Ek Tu, Anu Menon makes his directorial debut with London Paris New York. For this genre, certain ingredients are must-haves. The angst which stems from a break-up, the confidence of leaving your mark on the world, the lashing out when expectations fail and finally (say approximately ten minutes before the end credits) making peace with yourself and hopefully the others around you.This scenario has now been played out several times over the last decade with films such as Wake Up Sid, and Love Aaj Kal. When working with familiar plot points, a competent director must work hard to flesh out fresh, charming characters, where the audience loses track of time and is busy rooting for them.Nikhil Chopra is a Mumbai-born 'eternally confused rich kid' on his way to film school in London. Ali Zafar as the slightly debauched yet not entirely corrupted brat is totally, lovably believable. He moves energetically on the screen, and the half-smile which constantly hovers around his lips keeps you engaged. In a shopworn theme that love can strike anywhere at anytime, Ali bumps into Aditi Rao Hydari (Lalita Krishnan) the bouncy, energetic out-to- change-the-world feminist venturing on foreign shores for the first time. The sparks fly; their chemistry is obvious as they spend their days exploring London. The flirtatious conversations lead to attraction and takes both of them by surprise. Aditi appears to be a tourist on her first 'phoren' holiday with a knitted muffler around her neck, the sneakers and the casually plaited hair. Some promises are made, but they're both sensible enough to realize the futility of building a relationship across continents. It's time to move onÂ…Beginning on a light-hearted note, the director is unable to sustain the mood. When the characters are in a state of turmoil the dialogues lose their conversational feel. It's here the film starts running out of steam. The director uses melodrama to depict anxiety and stress.The film has its moments though. Aditi speaks her mind, barfs all over her lover boy in a drunken haze and doesn't set out to make herself alluring or enticing. But then there are also some major gaffes in the screenplay. Like Ali Zafar repeatedly using the same cuss word to make his point. Where Aditi Rao Hydari is concerned, her appearance reflects her state- of-mind. In Paris, she appears chic with her short stylish hair cut. And then in New York sees her with unkempt hair falling on her shoulders and thick glasses. The director wants us to believe we change at every stage of our lives, both in terms of appearance and our wants. An interesting theme which fails to take off. A sense of boredom sets in and the film drags. The clichÃ©d climax doesn't bring any sense of relief either.But London Paris New York isn't a love story about the actors alone. It does manage to effectively capture the spirit of the cities where the film has been shot. For those who recognize New York only through Karan Johar films see the same locations, with different lighting patterns, creating a distinctive mood. The film undoubtedly belongs to cinematographer Sameer Arya , who has aimed for a certain look-and-feel which he maintains consistently through out. Hand held shots, the grainy documentary effect in so many outdoor sequences, unconventional camera angles isn't something we see in rom-coms. And for that alone give this film a chance." 
" Unexpected.........Creative..........not any nonsense","I do not want to say much about this movie it doesn't means it don't deserve it but they say picture speak thousand words so but i like to say few thing that over all this movie is a nice good entertainer you know that when a movie make on relationship then only the audience there targeting is limited to young and intellectual people so generally such kind of movies until they have big banner name along with them or big star cast does not do well at box office so same happen with this movie.i watched this movie with least expectation but i it came out to surprise this movies combination of good story line nice acting and good music.so if you are looking for nice descent entertainer should watch this movie as it is not a regular stuff but if you are looking for some great movie on relationship this you will definitely will be disappointed." 
" those two have chemistry.","good casting. those two main protagonists really have chemistry. and ali zafar has a pair of eyes that can speak. he looks so natural, it feels as if he wasn't acting at all. he is also so talented, he is also the music director, singer, of course, dancer in this film. so it seems that he is not an Indian, but a parkistan, and they can actually do a film together. politics and films. mmm. although the story is a little predictable, i enjoyed this film very much. it is not too long like some other typical Indian films. i don't know why this film has a low rating, the story is believable. and it is nice to look at those two beautiful people on screen. it is also nice to see foreign sceneries." 
" a spoiled effort............","London Paris NEW YORK...........movie starts in London running,again movie goes to Paris running and ends in New York.Locations were nicely chosen but the problem is film was unable to deliver everywhere.In very short time director tried to express the love story between their stars at every location.Biggest problem is that director didn't captured the beauty of London,Paris AND NEW YORK.Film has potential to deliver but failed everywhere.Movie is too pacey and only it slowed down a bit in last 15 minutes of the movie.Again director haven't captured the required emotion required in last minutes of the movie.Actors were sweet but their talent is not used in the movie.Songs of the movies were sweet and adds zing.But in trying to make movie sweet n simple movie lost the feel required for the love story...........a better attempt is required by all crew members of the film.Hope that all of them will perform according to their potential in further movies.Movie reflects some shadows of BEFORE SUNRISE(1995) and BEFORE SUNSET(2004).......but not well told. A 5 star rating out of 10." 
" Good concept with bad storyline & dialogues...","The movie starts with the climax and rolls back to the history. There is no proper sequence and the worst acting by Aditi. Director did not portray enough locations of all the tree beautiful cities. Dialogues were very raw. It was a pain to watch this film although i thought the concept was good but it was BADLY executed. Ali's voice did not match his personalities and most of his lines felt very casual. It was not very clear as to why Aditi behaved the way she did when she returned to France. Climax was horrible. Filmmaker did not convince enough to show how someone can change her mind the last minute before wedding. How can some one go out the whole night with somebody else on a night before her marriage. That was a disaster for any climax."
