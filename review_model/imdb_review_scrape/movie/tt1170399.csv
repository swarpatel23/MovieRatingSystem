" C Kkompany is a brilliant attempt...","Sachin Yardi's 'C Kkompany' is a brilliant attempt made into a pretty good film. The idea 3 losers turning into robin hoods is pleasing, plus a don who's addicted to soap show and TV stars is hilarious. The film is a decent attempt, and the débutant director has handled the script in full command, he has written it as well. In a nutshell, 'C Kkompany' is a highly entertaining film. Performances: Mithunda is lovable as Datto Bhai. Tusshar Kapoor delivers a sincere performance. Anupam Kher is excellent. Rajpal Yadav is fantastic, especially in the scene where he's drunk and he confronts outside a bar. Raima Sen looks decent, and does a passable job. Dilip Prabhawalkar is good. Viju Khote is first-rate as the corrupted cop.on the whole 'C Kkompany' is a great watch... an underrated film. Thumbs Up!" 
" Tushar Kapoor Done It again","After A long time Tushar Kapoor Finally give a good Comedy Drama.The Story was Interesting and the Best Character was Jha's Rajpal Yadav's Really Enjoyed the Movie.You Must see this Movie With your Family.Better then Hari Puttar As well.Mithun(Datta Bhai also DOne a very good Role and the Movie also focused on Saas bahu drama Serials Well A good Movie Indeed.The Main MSg of this Movie was that People makes small gangster's terrorists big by saying there Name is Media and doing there Publicity.you would love to watch this Movie in Cinema. Tushar,Rajpal and Anupam Keep it Up.Hope that Indian Cinema Produce such kind of Comedy Movies As Much as people ENjoy" 
" What it lacks in substance it makes up for with laughter","Three down-on-their luck best friends (Anupam Kher, Tushar Kapoor and Rajpal Yadav) decide to dupe the pompous son of Kher's character in this funny but sometime boring comedy. Don't get me wrong, the plot was strong it's just that sometimes the film just dragged on. I didn't like the fact that they kept paying homage to other films (like Om Shanti Om, Dil Chahta Hai, even film star Akshay Kumar whom Kapoor's character is named after etc. etc. and at times it seemed like a spoof of 'Ek Chalis ki last local' and just dragged on but don't worry, it lives up to its awesome opening featuring a cameo by famed director and Bollywood personality Karan Johar as the host of Kaun Banega Crore Pati. Raima Sen co-stars." 
" Deserves more","A film which has been made out of more originality than several big names. Young director deserves a pat on hi back for a superb script like this and the way it was superbly executed. It was slapstick humor at its best, fun to watch and reduce stress level with such a light hearted comedy with a good social message. I think that is where the beauty lies, that you do not realize and the movie has left an impact. Commendable performances from Rajpal Yadav, Mithun DADA and Anupam Kher. The film binds the interest levels and even in year 2013, it does not let you take your eyes off even for a moment. Some of the comedy segments were very well executed specially the humor extracted out of the content for daily soaps. Mithun Da excels like no one else in this one. A better promotion of the film might have got bigger audience. The audience deserves to this movie because the it offers much more than what the outside package looks like it will offer." 
" Your Average Afternoon Flick! ♦ 62%","There's nothing much about the story when three down-ridden people work as Samaritans under the disguise of gangsters. We have watched this theme a couple of times in other media. But, the execution by Sachin Yardi needs to be applauded.Cast & their performance is very good, especially Rajpal Yadav who succeeds in inducing humor. Music & sings were average. Screenplay is mild & works while direction & cinematography are just fine. Although I was annoyed by the incessant references to Balaja Telefilms, their serials & puns about the woman behind it, I loved the sarcasm attached to it and since the second half takes a serious note, it altogether gave a fine experience.BOTTOM LINE: A good afternoon watch, this with ample amounts of comedy, drama & Bollywood-ism! Recommended a one-time watch!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" An advertisement for Balaji?","Balaji Telefilms hired débutante director Sachin Yerdi to write and publicize a long advertisement for their soaps and their stars. Targetted to be a comedy, the movie failed to humor me. The jokes are bad and acting poor. The plot revolves around three losers who are troubled with their lives, and threaten the son of one of them under a fictitious underworld company called C Kompany. The prank turns serious and people start getting afraid of them. Don't know what is Anupam Kher doing among a bunch of jokers here. Mithun the don irritates with his patronizing soap stars, and tear-shedding at soaps. Tusshar Kapoor is repulsive as usual. A total crap. Watch it only if you want a reason to pull your hair out."
