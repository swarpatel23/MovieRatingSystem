" Another sluggish movie from the Bhatt Camp","Nazar is a story of a young and talented pop star Divya ( Meera) who once driving back to home discovers a dead body.Divya goes to check on her and from then on, her life takes a complete turnaround as she starts getting premonitions about impending murders. A serial killer is on the loose who targets mumbai bar girls, Special Investigating Officer Rohan Sethi (Ashmit Patel) is investigating this case.Sethi employs Divya's constant visions and flashbacks to solve his case .The biggest flaw of nazar, beside the much hyped Pakistani heroine Meera is that it is very predictable. There are many situations in the movie where the audience knows whats gonna happen next.For a movie which counts on its suspense can;t be that predictable right from the start you get a feel of who is gonna be the killer.Soni Razdan did a decent job in few scenes but they are countable ....a small appearance by Sarita Joshi as a prostitute was brilliant. Same way Neena Gupta did a good enough job.Soni Razdan failed miserably in terms of script the story line was good enough and had huge scope of making a good thriller like 100 Days but the sloppy direction and some of the worst performances Nazar finds itself hard to survive.The acting arena was full of useless wrestlers who seemed to gave up right from the first shot. I bet you won't be able to stop laughing if you will see Koel Purie in the climax and the way in which the motive for the killings was explained was hilarious. Meera was a big big disappointment she neither looked god and acting Oh My god she looked very confused in front of the camera. Ashmit Patel was again a set back he did an awful job ,I m not sure of his career in the film industry if he will continue to give performances like these in the future.Aly Khan the doctor was another person whose expressions and dialog delivery style never changed through out the movie he was point black although he is a good actor but i guess Soni Razdan was not able to extract the best out of him.Overall Nazar goes down as another flops of the Indian film industry and with all the controversy it created before its release this movie is sure a no go. 2/10" 
" good pop corn flick","First of all great musical score ...WOW...fantastic!! The are times when the tension fails to hit the spot...and the Director could have added more directorial suspense..but overall a good pop corn flick...at the end of the day it entertained me and my friends...and one of the few films that had us talking and discussing in our after movie meal!! We went primarily to see the Movie, as we had heard it was Bollywood Star, Rupak Mann's screen debut. She looked cute and great on screen....disappointing that we only got to see her for a few scenes...but she did a grand job...well done girl...you certainly had screen presence! Thought Meera's character was a bit flat...and Ashmit was definitely mis-cast. Best part for me....the Ali-Ali song...great score...and hey, we get a bonus of seeing our very own Bollywood starlet Rupak showing her rhythm...great stuff. Not your Jagged Edge...but deserves a view for the sheer musical score and for Ruapk's genuine performance." 
" Cool thriller","The Bhatt camp makes another well-made edge-of-the-seat thriller. The story is quite interesting as it revolves around protagonist Meera who receives eye transplants after an accident. She realizes she has been given ESP powers after continuously seeing horrifying visions, which are actually "live broadcasts" of gruesome murders. The story of the girl whose eyes Meera's originally belonged to is also quite interesting. She was a prostitute who earned the reputation of a witch because of her ability to predict murders until she finally predicted her own. The scene with the prostitute's mother is very intense and emotional. The climax is full of gripping suspense. Meera gave a good debut. Ashmit Patel also gave a good performance. Songs are good, especially the title track. This movie definitely beats Naina, which has pretty much the same story." 
" Highly Entertaining!!","I found this movie to be quite engaging and interesting throughout with plenty of plot twists and turns, and never was I bored from start to finish. The ending actually came as a surprise to me! Meera did an excellent job with her role, as did Koel Purie. Aashmit Patel was OK.The cinematography was slick and fast paced, and the whole thing had a nice Hollywood psycho-thriller feel to it. Very well done again, Mr. Mahesh and Mukesh Bhatt as well as Soni Razdan!! Highly recommend it. The psychology shown behind the killer's motives was believable, and I especially enjoyed the atmosphere and the background music of the bars and night clubs shown throughout. Even the name of the club, "Night Lovers" was very retro and enjoyable!" 
" An awfully bad movie","This is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. I agree that it's a thriller but it lost all of its jazz in the midway.Director Soni Razdan cannot handle a plot properly. She misses most of the plot and cannot even weave a story out of the murder mystery.'Nazar' is Pakistani actress Meera's debut film. She could've done wonders with the role she got. But she looks lost in front of the camera and also looks fat. Meera shares no chemistry with the lead actor, Ashmit Patel. Well talking about Ashmit Patel, the less said the better. He grows his hair overly long and does not fit in the role of a cop. It's obvious that he's here only for sex as he enjoyed Meera's body in the photoshoot of the movie and some money. Koel Purie is another terrible actress. She does look menacing but acting-wise she's not perfect. Avtar Gill and Rupak Mann are wasted.Direction is sloppy. Cinematography is horrible. Music is bad. Editing is not in sync. Overall, an awfully bad movie. Don't watch it, it's that simple!"
