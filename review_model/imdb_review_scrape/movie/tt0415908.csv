" Exciting story about a killer tiger","Krish, a biologist from National Geographic, is sent out to investigate the case of a killer tiger haunting the Indian jungle. On his way, he joins a group of youngsters who are out for adventure and some hunting. Deep in the jungle, they meet the mysterious Kali, who warns them to go back. Of course, they refuse, and the more they get lost, the more the plot thickens. For a horror flick from Bollywood, Kaal is not a bad movie at all. It is, in any case, way beyond the monsters-with-faces-like-pizzas kind of horror that used to dominate Bollywood in the 1980s and 1990s, and unlike horror flicks of the "who's next?" type, it keeps you focused from the beginning till the end, and at times really manages to surprise. Sure, there are things we always know in advance: if there are a few better known actors and a few unknown, we all know who is going to be eaten first. But that's a minor thing.Before watching Kaal, all I knew was that it was some sort of Indian "Jaws" with a tiger instead of a shark. And I am grateful for that, because otherwise the appearance of Kali, a mysterious inhabitant of the jungle, might have evoked the wrong kind of expectations. I for one found myself utterly surprised when he turned out to be the "bhoot", the ghost he had been telling about, himself. A fascinating character! What I like best about him is the fact that he never hurts anybody, on the contrary, he keeps warning everybody. Nobody dies because of Kali or a tiger. All those who die, die merely because of their own stupidity. They should have listened to Kali.The film has another huge asset: the excellent background score by the duo Salim-Sulaiman. That said, there are a few decisive minuses as well. First of all, the movie begins with a completely idiotic video clip featuring Shahrukh Khan in a wet shirt, which has nothing in common with the movie whatsoever. They might as well have filled the same space with a commercial, or, for that matter, with a black screen. Another weak point are the characters. Ajay Devgan does an excellent job as Kali, but the script fails to work out any of the other characters. Even calling them flat or cardboard would be too much, because frankly, there's no character in them at all. Vivek Oberoi manages best, but John Abraham fails to impress and especially the women (Lara Dutta and Esha Deol) serve no other purpose than being pretty and constantly afraid. This poor characterisation has a major disadvantage: you can't identify with the characters and never really care if someone dies or not. But all in all, the exciting plot makes up for this weakness. It didn't stop me at all from enjoying "Kaal"." 
" Disaster!","When you have a reputable banner, Dharma Productions, BIG stars-Shah Rukh Khan and Karan Johar, and a fantastic publicity campaign backing a film, you KNOW the movie will make money. The fantastic start that KAAL has got at the box office is obviously, no surprise. But, the movie, dear Dharma productions, is sad, bad and very boring.The movie is about John Abraham, a tiger expert working for National Geographic, his photographer wife, Esha Deol who goto Orbit Park to unearth the secrets of man-eating tigers. Surprisingly, this happens without any information to the channel, and they just land up there and try explore. The story then brings in Vivek Oberoi, Lara Dutta and their two friends, all of whom are on vacation, and as their car breaks down, a sudden turn of events lands them at Orbit Park, and after they meet Abraham and Deol, the story moves on. They meet the tigers and Ajay Devgan later, and soon tragedies happen around them, and I wouldn't spoil that for anyone who'd want to see this ridiculous excuse of a movie, which has no narrative and pace.Soham tries to make his audience THINK. Like Oberoi lighting the cigarette and Abraham making that scary face. Obviously, the audience add two and two and make i four, but Mr. Soham is no Hitchcock. Dude, when you throw in something confusing at least offer an explanation for it. THAT's what makes the movie interesting and adds repeat value. Remember when Kevin Spacey says "the greatest trick the devil ever pulled off was to convince the world that he did not exist" or when Haley Joel Osement says "I see dead people around...the big problem is they themselves do not know they're dead"...well, it all had a meaning! Oberoi saying "smoking kills" and then smoking, eeesh! Care to explain? There are a gazillion more loop holes! A lot of people have spoken about the 'mixed reactions' the movie as got. Heck, the movie has got bad reviews everywhere, except for from Mr. Taran Adarsh, leading trade analyst. And that makes me think, why and how. Quite simply, he is obsessed with everything Karan Johar and ShahRukh Khan do. And he has no qualms about it either. He'd even rate admittedly bad things from the Khan-Johar camp and make them sound good. So, when such a reputed analyst rates the film so highly, most of the audiences are given further incentive to go watch the film.I remember when DHOOM released, Mr. Adarsh very categorically said that "after the initial hype, this movie will die down". Taran, DHOOM was still an entertainer. KAAL, to which you give 4 stars out of 5, is dull. You may love Johar and SRK, but call a spade a spade man! I'd give this movie a */***** and that too for the brilliant sound, and the very first item number on SRK and the hot hot Malaika. The movie is downhill from there. Of course, SRK and Johar would go laughing to the bank, but guys, please don't torture us like this anymore." 
" 'Crouching Tiger, Hiding Viewer'","'Crouching Tiger, Hiding Viewer!'Kaal Dir- Soham Cast- Vivek Oberoi, John Abraham, Lara Dutta, Esha Deol, Vishal Malhotra, Vineet Sharma and Ajay Devgan. Written by- Soham Rating- *Man-eating tigers are the least horrifying aspect of 'Kaal'- Karan Johar's Dharma Productions and Shahrukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment's valiant march into Varma's world! There's a much more dangerous threat lurking in the reels of this debacle! It appears as if the whole cast is infected with a virus that induces horrendously low levels of acting! In what must be a brilliant achievement- Soham has managed to extract impossibly bad performances not only from 'specialists at bad acting' like Esha Deol and Lara Dutta, but even from the talented Vivek Oberoi and the highly gifted Ajay Devgan. That leaves us with John Abraham. Don't worry, he's pathetic too! We are first introduced to his toned abdomen while he is running and then, shown him serenading with a python! Some gay fantasy, this! Thankfully, we are also informed that he works with the National Geographic and has a wife, Riya(Esha Deol). Krish(Johnny boy!) and Riya head off to the jungle of Orbit Park to investigate an increasing number of suspicious killings, apparently by tigers. Jungle mein mangal? Orbit(Corbett rechristened?!?) Park incidentally boasts the largest number of tigers in India. Also on their way to this tigerland are a group of city-bred animals- Dev(Vivek Oberoi), Ishika(Lara Dutta), Vishal(Vishal Malhotra) and Sajid(Kushal Punjabi). A car-breakdown and a 'mrityunjaya mantra' reciting weirdo(Vineet Sharma) later, our animals encounter the python-lover and his lover! A few more reels and a few more killings! Enter Kali Pratap Singh(Ajay Devgan), a mysterious villager who offers to help them get out of the jungle. All things aside, Ajay Devgan's entrance is a crackling scene that actually gives one the goose bumps, unlike the creepy scenes which were meant toÂ…but never do! The time by which this bunch runs away from the jungle, a few more surprises are revealed. A good student of cinema will see the twist coming a long way before it actually does. And while that takes away from the thrill of the revelation, what hurts more is the script's sudden jumping of genres. A bad case of identity crisis- the script is unsure whether it is a thriller or a horror! So while the movie promises you a wild thriller in the first half, it resorts to the supernatural in the latter half! The screenplay moves at a turgid pace with no significant episode in the first three-quarters of an hour. Desperate attempts at making the audiences jump from their seats result in loud guffaws. Sample this- we are led to believe that an anonymous hand is about to cause some terror to a character only to be revealed that the hand in question is the character's own! Hands down, the most stupid scene! Also stupid is Lara Dutta exercising her vocal chords in a role that she has screamed her way through! Vivek Oberoi makes more facial contortions than a constipated man while Esha Deol redefines poor acting and looks like she's straight out of a lingerie ad for a tiger-skin brassiere! The usually dependable Ajay Devgan is made to mouth lines that are far below his acting quotient. The only decent act comes from Vineet Kumar as Bagga. The sound by Dwarak Warrier is brilliant but overused to a nauseating effect. In a nutshell, Dharma is no Varma! All the monkey-screeches, tiger-roars, owl-howls and Lara-screams add up to one excruciating visit to the cinema hall! A toddler behind me kept insisting his father to leave the theater and go home. Actually, he was voicing the sentiments of all present!Abhishek BandekarRating- ** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent29th April, 2005" 
" A super time waster","Kaal was supposed to be the best film of the year before its release. But, as usual bollywood has produced yet another Hollywood style (read copy) time waster. The macho men like Ajay Devagan and Vivek Oberoi also could not save the disaster.Some sequences clearly are copied from "Final Destination" and Taran Adarsh of Indiafm says these scenes are the best. I seriously don't understand how come he became a film critic. Tasteless cheap idiot.The promos gave much hype to the movie with tigers and all the stuff. Clearly Soham concentrated more on the promos than the original film. Esha and Lara prove to be a waste. To be frank I don't find a single positive point about the movie except the marketing and pre release promotion.My advice is not to watch the movie and waste your money.Rating **." 
" All Hype","You know how you end up going to the movies because the star cast was intriguing, and then you walk out of the theatre wondering why you were led on by your pathetic intuition that the star cast might make the movie a real hit? This is one of them. Cept, i only went because of misleading information that the movie was great. Horrible. Names like "Shahrukh", "Karan Johar", "Malaika" were simply used to lure in the crowd... for a complete disappointment.The movie is not scary in the least bit. It relies on the sudden increase in volume of screaming monkeys, birds, bananas, and what-have-you. Fear Factor? Yeah right...Overall, a badly compiled movie with scenes from "Final Destination" (the eerie method by which people get knocked off the stupid script), "The Ring" (the dilapidated well), "The Ghost and The Darkness" (the malnutritioned tigers)... the list could go on, but i was busy yawning, and joining other people's conversation during the movie.I wont stop you from going to the movie. But i would definitely like to point out that it's better off rented, that too when you want a complete "time-pass" movie." 
" Back to the same Bollywood Mantra","I had seen this film yesterday, considering it to be a Karan Johar & Shahrukh Khan Production, expected much more than the crap that I just saw.The Acting was very poor, plots that were undefined & unexpected, background music that was terrible & reallyyyyyyy nothing scary. It was just a popcorn ride.The film could have been much, much, better than what was imagined & directed by Soham. The plot changed from one part to another & then what do you recognize at the end, it is the same old Indian Masala.Most of the Scenes were copied from Hollywood films which by surprise should not happen under a Huge banner.Well at the end, just would like to say that it was waste of time & money." 
" Great Story Gone Awry","Shahrukh Khan & Karan Johar's KAAL is an apt example of Cinema gone Wrong in a big way.......Since there were LOt of References to make from .....The Ghost & The Darkness, The Wrong Turn, Blair witch Project & of the like......The film should not have gone wrong.....but the crappy twist & the faulty screenplay takes away the charm that Actors(Mainly: Ajay Devgan & John Abraham) & the Technical Team(Santosh Thundiyil....Take A Bow....)packs it....Soham is a Good Craftsman...But not a Fine Story-teller...he should not have wasted the great production on such a inept story....Maybe he can tell a apt story next time ..... ..... Overall Expectation Ruined...... Good story Turned Faulty......" 
" The worst NAT GEO feature is much much better than this trash...","Pride is what caused Kaal. I could somehow feel Karan Johar in each and every shot, and the forced acting, the worst use of the wide angle, funny jungle sounds you could buy on a cheap CD, and of course, Shah Rukh Khan and Mallaika. For a moment it seemed more like a Pepsi Commercial, and a badly directed one at that. Strangers meet in jungle, hacked one by one, until they come upon the big secret, something that you'll guess anyway within the first fifteen minutes of the movie. the only person it might fool is someone sleeping through the movie. The Director must have really begged to get this chance, and Karan Johar must have been desperately bored. Some claim this film is a hit. Of course it will be. That's why Shah Rukh appears at the beginning, to tell us: "it's all right! this kind of crap is endorsed by me, see?" The movie is an insult to the paying-public. Of course, only a Karan Johar can get away with such blatant disrespect, with his already immoral films setting the trends for today's youngsters. while aditya chopra strives for morals, karan johar exploits the lack of it. True, he does vibe well with the public. But for how long?" 
" Great Way to kill ur TIME (kaal)","(MIS) Cast - John Abraham, Esha Deol, Vivek oberoi, Lara Dutta, Ajay devgan, Kushal Punjabi and Pameet Sethi, The movie is all about why it is happening at the ORBIT National Park, (Jim Corbet Netional Park, Uttranchal , India (RENAMED)). Any ways what was so strange there. Some mysterious killings. but as it is well known (rumored) that it is being done by a MANEATNG tigers group!!!!!!! And guess who is going there to find out what is behind the scene, (A photographer from National Geographic channel)John Abraham,- Can some body answer where are Indian FOREST OFFICERS, (ON LEAVE/or every one left the "Orbit " National Park, because they know a natgeo photographer will be here to find this out)-. was there with his Wife (Esha Deol).and then there was Vivek Oberoi and party, vivek with his Girl Friend Lara Dutta and Kushal Punjabi plus Vihsal , (Point to be noted ) they met in a way that Vivek Oberoi's (Re Technitioned)LAND CRUISER and NAT GEO's TATA SAFARI or Mahindra SCOPIO (or something like that) both broke down and they got lift from a man diving Maruti Gypsi (moral of the story Land Crusier is not meant for Safari Ride ). Interesting.after that three or four accidents while safari. Sound Defects (i repeat defects) -a Match stick flame felt like a blast - what will u call it EFFECT!!!!!!! oh enough of sound effects thing, where is Ajay Devgan, so here he is just before Intermission to save the life of our worthy heroic group, (mylord point to be noted Vishal was filming the scene on his SONY handy cam) .after some two or three mysterious killing they found the real Culprit and they escape from jungle for the sake of life because they can not kill any body who is all ready dead.They got the secret and escaped . And the most hilarious part of the movie ---> a NATGEO photographers generates his task report and wrote it as "all is done by a bhoot(GHOST) and not by the MANEATING TIGER!!!!!!!!", who is the Ghost???? - sorry sir i am not supposed to destroy a movies business for this u have to watch the movie. Better wait for VCD/DVD and rent it, because the movie is not a worth keepingwhat is done by actors -- nothing!!! Lara, John and Ajay were quite talented from my point of view, before i had seen the movie. Vivek and Esha are again a not to talk about thing.and this movie seems to be a long advertisement of SONY and NATGEO. the movie starts from a great count of media and official partners.No awards on counting them, yet been declared by Dharma productions and Red Chillies. Do watch it if u want to kill u KAAL(TIME). Guys this is not KAAL this is AKAAL of one good Bollywood thriller.2 out of ten." 
" Read this only if you have seen this movie","Well! This is not your usual IMDb comment on this master-piece(of sh!t). This comment is here strictly for philanthropic purposes. You should read this comment AFTER you have seen Kaal.OKay. You must be thinking that you have seen the worst movie since the big bang ( or the ice-age, if , by nature, you are kind and forgiving ). Well.. I am here to give you a new interpretation to the movie and make you feel a li'l less cheated. Firstly, don't think that this movie belongs to the horror genre. Secondly you should not think that that Kaali was a killer was meant to be a surprise. Thirdly and most importantly, you should not even think that he is a bhoot. Kaali is not a bhoot. He is just a madman who talks about himself in the third person. And he thinks he died. When Villagers beat him black and blue, they did not kill him. He survived. But he lost his senses and started believing that he died. And all the deaths we see in the movie are those that are accidents or murders. The surviving characters think of him as a bhoot. They do that based on some silly evidence. They cant find his image - either in the well or in the video camera. Well, vivek oberai could not see the image in the well because the angle was not correct. And of course Kaali could not be seen in the camera - That was expected. After all, the conditions under which the camera was used were not exactly conducive for perfect composition of film.Thus, You should look at Kaali as a madman who is mistaken to be bhoot by the rest of the characters. If you have seen Citizen Kane, you would see some parallels here with the "rosebud". If you can see this way, you will understand that Kaal is not the poor man's "Urban Legend" as it is made out to be, but it is an amateur director's attempt at Citizen Kane. Now some advice: Next time you think of going to a movie in which a male actor is doing an 'item number', think again. May be it'd be more enjoyable to get struck in a traffic jam on a hot summer afternoon in an Indian City." 
" spend 2 hrs. of your life on something more useful","Amazed by the promos,I happily took the risk of putting my studies apart and watched the movie.And it is necessary to say-I WASTED MY TIME.Truly,a ridiculous movie,with no aim,no theme and no direction(of course we can say this).I was thinking in the whole movie that when the movie will begin?That's true,there was no beginning in the movie.Just a fool effort of horrifying the viewer.And the reason behind all these murders-the ghost,My GOD,how one can write such a boring story.And the ending of the movie was the worst one I ever saw.The only plus point of the movie was it's background score.Salim-Sulaiman done their job quite nicely.The part of the forest officer was forcefully send to the doubt list.With so many flaws,the movie only puts the fame of Johar camp down.DON'T WATCH IT,EVEN AT FREE OF COST,USE TWO HOURS OF YOUR LIFE FOR SOMETHING USEFUL." 
" A Jungle Horror","This is an ill-conceived, ill-written and ill-directed movie. The infrared shots of the jungle with background sound of crickets does't evoke any admiration for the grossly immature direction. Then there is the venerable Ajay Devgan as "Kali (Kali Prathap Singh to be precise-to let the viewers know that this reviewer has seen this film), walking out of the woods like Moses, with a bamboo pole (with Manish Malhotra not far behind!)-three tigers walk away with the tail between their legs! truly a jungle Film, there is even magic here. I can't believe a reputable banner like Dharma Productions would be remotely associated with this junk, However I can fully believe someone like Sharukh Khan would be behind this venture, since Junk Films are right up his alley." 
" painful movie","the movie doesn't contain any plot or substance. there are two item number routines, one to start the movie off, and another to end it off.other than these, there is nothing much interesting in the movie.the two actresses try to display as much flesh as possible, which is a little confusing, considering that the whole movie is shot in the middle of a jungle. one must admit that the director has utilized the resources at his disposal in this department well.the tigers don't appear long enough in the script. when they do its quite an artificial scene. hardly something that makes one tremble with fear.biggest issue is the disconnect between the pitching of the movie through its two songs, while the movie has nothing to do with them." 
" Not worth the time and money.","Pros and Cons of KaalPros: 1. Title Song 2. some very few chilling scenes 3. Dwarak Warrier has some good sound effectsCons: 1. A supernatural story in the guise of a realistic entertainer. ('Darna Mana Hai' was a much better movie.) 2. Bad Cinematography. Immature use of wide angle shots. 3. Editing is too fast-cut; especially when it comes to showing dead bodies or tiger attacks 4. National Geographic has done a blunder in associating itself with such a storyline. 5. Too many logical mistakes 6. Immature Direction; Soham should have resisted the temptation to use cheap tricks to induce horror. Soham, next time, do a sanity check on the scenes after you shoot them. 7. Jarring background score 8. Bad acting 9. Does not really promote any awareness on tiger conservation or wildlife preservation. 10. Tigers look as if they are on a circus ramp. Don't forget to watch their 'catwalk' during the Ajay Devgan introduction scene." 
" High on hype,low on material","This movie is a bit different than what you expect from Hindi cinema.cast was a big factor for audience. Promo songs "Kaal Dhmaal" especially was good.Promos were very catchy.Red CHillies (Sharuk khan) and Karan Johar were the producers and Director Soham Has been Asst. of Ram Gopal Verma and Karan Johar.but unfortunately,After the high hype created my promos and web reviews, i expected a nice excited supernatural thriller.....yes supernatural it was but no way near being nice and exciting.first of all the story and direction let me down. The first scene of John with an ANACONDA....lolz. He was running with him on the ground and able to catch it and when the phone rang....he simply dropped it....i really don't know what the director wanted the audience to see.Director tried to make us curious by the characterisation of Vivek Oberoi and there were no explanation of his attitude in the movie....lots of characters in the movie without any significance.....Introduction of Ajay Devgan and his dialogue were good at times....but ,most of the time story is predictable. Overall, a letdown.YET ANOTHER FLOP BY RED CHILLIES ENTERTAINMENT" 
" Watching National Geographic is better","Plot Outline: Tourists Dev (Vivek Oberoi), Ishika (Lara Dutta) and two friends explore Orbit National Park, a tiger haven. They meet Wildlife experts Krish (John Abraham) and Riya (Esha Deol) who are exploring recent mysterious man-eater killings for National Geographic Channel. They are joined by Kali (Ajay Devgan) who takes up the challenge of guiding them though the mysteries of the jungle.Comment: Kaal is pot-pourri of Ram Gopal Verma and Karan Johar's styles since Writer/Director Soham had been an assistant to both. RGV's style is visible in the thriller plot, pale ghosts and bizarre deaths. Johar didn't forget to cast SRK, this time in an Item number. The movie shares similarities with Ghost and the Darkness, Wrong Turn, etc.There isn't much acting to see, thanks to the incoherent script and lack of room for characters to grow. Music is decent; choreography is stereotype. Jim Corbett National Park is well captured. No wonder they are facing a suit for the alleged violation of the Wildlife act.Rating: 2/5"
