" A cliche done beautifully...","First of all, it is Bollywood!  So stop looking for signs of a Spielberg flick!!  True, the plot is a Bollywood clich√©; rich girl, poor boy, angry parents, etc.  But keep in mind that the story line wasn't so tired and typical when this movie was first released and helped lead to a decade of romance-driven Bollywood movies. Khan portrays a solid character who has both comical and dramatic moments beautifully acted by him.  And Madhuri, who won a best actress award for this role, delivers a great performance. The soundtrack is very good, thanks to the exceptional voice of Udit Narayan whose smile you can "hear" through the music. I gave this movie 5 starts instead of 4 because I have such fond memories of watching it when it came out in 1990.  But compared to other Bollywood movies, it should really be a 4." 
" Fantastic Movie",""Dil" is my favorite Hindi film. Aamir Khan and Madhuri Dixit are both SENSATIONAL actors, and I really wish they had done more films together. Since both Aamir and Madhuri are talented actors, together, they make an excellent pair. Plus, they are both good-looking. I love this movie - it is filled with drama, romance, and comedy. I find many Hindi films to be slow and boring, but not this one.Films such as Dilwale Dulhanie Le Jayenge, Taal, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, and Dil To Pagal Hai turned out to be hits. To be quite honest, I found these films to be so slow and boring, I nearly fell asleep halfway through. Dil is not a boring film. It is a great, entertaining, emotional film, a must-see. So romantic. Raja and Madhu are deeply in love. Dil is the best Hindi film ever!!" 
" One of the best when it released","Dil was a youthful film with Aamir and Madhuri being paired together for the first time (or was it second with Deewana Mujh Sa Nahi?). Either way, the pairing was fresh and the audiences flocked to the cinema halls to make this film the biggest hit of the year.The story in a nutshell was that of Anupam Kher, who runs a tiny shop buying old newspapers but wants his only son Raja (Aamir Khan) to get married to a rich businessman's (Sayeed Jaffery) daughter Madhu (Madhuri Dixit). He even tricks Jaffery into believing that he himself is a rich business tycoon. Initially Raja and Madhu cannot stand each other but soon they fall in love only to their parents opposing to the alliance once Jaffery discovers the truth about Anupam Kher. Will Raja and Madhu unite? The film has everything that a good entertainer during the 90s demanded. Comedy, action, drama, romance and good songs. Director Indra Kumar received a well deserved nomination for this film while Madhuri Dixit bagged her first filmfare award.Music directors Anand-Milind continued their top phase with this film, which was the best music of the year until Aashiqui and Nadeem-Shravan decided to rewrite history. Nevertheless, the songs of the film were extremely popular and continue to be popular till date. This is one of the few albums where all the songs were a hit.All in all, Dil is a good entertainer and a recommended watch. Go for it!" 
" Wow..a classic, a must see","I have been seeing this movie again and again since childhood when i owned it on a VHS (and stooped watching it when my VCR broke)..anyway the film is hilarious in the beginning and an excellent die-hard romance story in the end with a not so obvious happy ending. The movie is great to watch, amazing for college kids form any era, the film is fantastic, the songs are amazing, the whole vibe is so young and hip. It has all the cool hip college stuff about parties and bunking classes in the beginning and in the end it turns into something like a romantic coming of age adventure, where the hero (amir khan) and heroine (madhuri) live their life somehwere else (well complemented by a song). There is even a rape scene inbetween after which their love begins, much better then beating up thugs, an excellent change for the Indian cinema at that time. We can see that the way the move goes was probably inspired by some American movies (perpahps grease) however the movies tempo was also taken up in johar and yash movies i.e. a comic beginning, a sad middle and a happy end. Very nicely done, spectacular, the characters are what they should. Amir and Madhuri look excellent for the role, both were young (they still are) at the time and did their parts with true honesty. Same goes for others and each character changed from a comic to aserious one in the later HALF of the movie. Brilliant, just brilliant" 
" Excellent, Fantastic and Superb","Mujhe Neendh na aye is a beautiful song from this super hit film. Dil is a teen romantic movie with lots of comedy and family drama added in. The first half is non stop comedy and is the best half. The second half is still good but a little bit more slower. Amir Khan is a fine actor and this is his early film where he delivers a good performance. Madhuri Dixit is the beautiful actress with so much talent who is great in this film. Anupom Kher is A Class in this film playing a wealthy man who wants more money and is stingy as hell. He is fantastic and made me laugh through the whole film. Great Direction, Lovely film, Nice songs and a simple storyline. I have seen this film 10 times and im still not bored of this." 
" Heartwarming romance","The movie is very sweet and emotional.Direction is not bad.Script is great.Story is nice.It tells about Raja who meets Madhu.At first sight they fight.Then they discover love,Engagement is planned,But it is broken soon.They want to be together,But they marry.But they broke off.This was Inder Kumars debut who gave us entertainers like Beta,Raja,Ishq,Mann,Dhammal.Aamir gives a terrific performance he should have received best actor rather than the Pathetic Sunny Deol in Ghayal that year.Madhuri also gives another terrific performance.Deven and Anupham also give great performances.The first half has comedy that keeps you very entertained.Second half has lots of Drama and Romance that also keeps you entertained.Chemistry is wonderful.Dancing is great.Comedy is great and funny to.The music by Anand Miland is perfect.Songs like"Humne Ghar Choda Hai","Hum Pyar Karne Wala" are very emotional and are quite melodious tracks.The movie is a watch Rating-7/10" 
" Sweet movie starring a very young n skinny Dangal guy.","Hazari Prasad (Anupam Kher) is a miser who dreams of finding a rich young woman for his only son, Raja (Aamir Khan), to marry. However, Raja is a spendthrift who is only interested in spending his father's money on wild parties.One day as Raja is walking to his college along with his friends, a passing jeep douses him with mud and the rude response of the beautiful Madhu (Madhuri Dixit) who is driving enrages Raja. He tricks Madhu into thinking that he is blind and then mocks her when the truth is revealed. The two quickly become enemies and play pranks on each other. Raja causes Madhu to trip during a dance rehearsal, and she forces him into a fight with the school's champion boxer Shakti (Adi Irani), which Raja wins." 
" Even the songs were poor Copies","A horrible movie in my opinion. Absolutely male-chauvinistic. The lead pair was at its peak at that time and the music was catchy, which probably made it a hit with the masses.But the music Directors Anand-Milind are notorious for copying tunes note-by-note from the maestro Ilayaraja. (an unparalleled genius who has composed for over 720 movies and has the credit of composing a symphony in 28 days flat- (a feat honored by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra)The duo of Anand and Milind has made its career out of rehashing the songs of Ilayaraja and this film's success and the lack of any copyright laws only encouraged them to copy his tunes for all their future films... until of course A R Rahman stormed into the music industry and scared the living-daylights out of these fellows...Dil was an absolutely overrated 'masala' film which hardly entertained." 
" inane formula film","This film is a hodge-podge of various idiotic cliches. For instance, boy-meets-spoilt-rich-girl and gets her to fall in love with him by harassing her in college (an over-used backdrop in recent Indian commercial films). A male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (having been used ad nauseum in several other films). As with many other recent commercial Hindi films, the film abounds with the incongruous insertion of songs, which probably contributed to the film's success more than anything else." 
" Aamir's and Madhuri's hit together","Indra Kumar is one director who made it big just by following one trend DIL was a superhit, his first film. The film brought Aamir and Madhuri for the first time together, they also starred in a dud Deewana Mujhsa Nahin in the same year. The film is like most films in 80s and 90s with first half being on comedy and second half on drama. The film starts with Anupam Kher playing a miser who dreams of making it big and fools Saeed Jaffrey who is a big man and father of Madhuri by pretending to act rich only to be insulted later. Aamir and Madhuri relationship starts with fights and pranks, there are some fun moments some too outlandish too,though the students in the college look too old but anywayz in bollywood films it's okay There's also a ghastly rape attempt scene which is well handled though The spat at the interval point is well handled and the second half is good though at times things are stretched too much like Aamir and Madz getting married in police station and also the climax which is similar to Aashiqui released in the same year.Direction by Indra Kumar is decent Music by Anand-Milind was a rage, Khambe Jaisi is a good song, while Na Jaane Kahaan is superb, Dumb Duma Dumb was added later is also a good numberAamir Khan plays the role well, this film was a comeback for him after duds post QSQT, Madhuri too does well, Anupam Kher though few years older to Aamir in real life, does his job well though at times he overdoes, Saeed Jaffrey hams as usual, rest are okay"
