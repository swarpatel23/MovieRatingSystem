" You wait and wait, and wait for it to kick-start","By any standards Phoonk-I was no great milestone so I wondered what was the intent behind the sequel. Maybe the writer potentially can translate it better on screen and set a new benchmark. Sadly the reality speaks a different lingo. Major part of the movie is akin to waiting lounge. Twiddling thumbs. Admist the the eerie camera movement and spooky sound effects you await for the plot to get going. Sadly the snail twitches after a point when the audience has totally lost interest. Very similar to dilly-dallying a candy with a kid and offering it when he doesn't want any more. Owing to the failed engine, the performances of everyone gets awashed. Agreed that RGV believes in taking risks and providing platform to newcomers. But with Phoonk-II one can only advise that he should drop his entire team like hot potatoes and start afresh. And please leave the horror genre alone." 
" What a blowout","When I got out of a theater with an excruciating headache thanks to the movie that finds its place in the IMDb bottom 100, 'RGV ki AAG', I realized with a sinking feeling that the man who made movies like Satya and Company had undoubtedly suffered a severe concussion.But to come to this, RGV? Funding equally clueless film makers who have no doubt tottered up to your foot steps, jarring camera angles and irrelevant close ups et al. Who scripted this thing? Not the 5 year old child actor of this movie for sure. He looked far too sensible for it. For it is nothing but Bhoot, Vastu Shastra and Phoonk 1 sliced up and edited together. The tragedy is, this one might pass off as a parody of all of themI will tell you what is scary about this movie. The fact that film makers still think they can botch together a movie out of things that have stopped scaring people 25 years ago. During the entire course of this sham (I really can't dignify it by calling it a movie) I felt more emotionless than one of those frozen hibernating frogs. You see, I've been rendered so incredibly numb that I can't even elucidate just how vile a mockery of the craft of film making this is.However, I am eternally grateful to the makers for keeping it shorter than 2 hours. Had I been one of them, I'd have taken my name off the credits.The tagline reads 'The first one was a warning'. I'll tell you something, this review is one as well." 
" No Story - Whats there to see?","Its absolute nonsense. Have a Ghost who kills everyone. No one even fights with it. No Tantra mantra nothing. Tantrik says "Take your daughter and run away, and hope that the ghost never finds you, there is no solution to this". This is Dumb, while they are running, wont the ghost know? LOL Also, end is the worst, you always hope, something should happen, but nothing happens. The ghost is in his wife, she is so powerful, but somehow slips from rooftop, falls down and dies? Along with her the ghost also dies? Give me a break.This movie is a Waste of time. Use it better by sleeping. It is not that it is badly directed, there is nothing new to be shown. Also a lot of scenes in movie don't make sense. They just show some weird angle to make you scare, but nothing happens." 
" It's not even 'P' of the original PHOONK.","A sequel is primarily planned to take advantage of the successful connection established by the original with the audiences. Hence as a necessary ingredient a sequel should not only have the essence of its first part but should also essentially surpass its original in content and achievement. No doubt it's really tough to do that and it needs a lot of hard work to repeat the success enjoyed by the original. But Phoonk 2 amazingly breaks all set notions of making a sequel and goes on to make a statement which is completely underworked, strange and over-confident.As a straight remark Phoonk 2 has been made only for the sake of trying a sequel. It is vaguely based on the story of revenge being taken by the spirit of the lady who was killed in the first part. But apart from this one line idea of vengeance it has got nothing in the name of horror to offer to its viewers. Starting with the same old tried and tested formula of shifting to a new house, which obviously is the haunted one, the movie doesn't even try to give something new to its fans. Right from the first scene itself, you feel the same type of ambiance, background sounds and camera angles served in the name of the sequel, which was very unexpected from the veteran Ram Gopal Verma and his team of directors.With an extremely slow pace, Phoonk 2 never ever starts really. It keeps testing your patience with slow camera movements introducing you to the every corner of the house, but not the spirit. A very lazy and uninteresting first half clearly gives you an idea that RGV has once again tried to play around with his one line ideas, wasting both the money and time of his die-hard fans. Moving into the second half the viewer doesn't feel excited anymore to see what happens next as he can easily guess all the future proceedings with his eyes closed. The over lengthy and unexplainable climax comes as another torture for the viewer and one just wants to leave the theater as soon as possible to catch on to the ongoing IPL match instead coming on the Television.In few words, the movie has nothing to offer in any of its department involved in film-making. The writers have written the sequences only around a one line idea provided to them and have added the same old doll, crow, a maid, a tantric, a new house and a spirit into the script and that's it. The sound designer puts in the same sources exploited in the other horror films from the famous production house. The actors have performed fine as their true duty towards RGV and the director but one simply misses the strong presence of Ashwini Kalsekar in this sequel. The cameraman shoots the movie using the same manual of RGV's previous horror movies and the director Milind Gadagkar wastes his golden opportunity to connect with the viewers.Interestingly, the promotional campaign uses a tagline below the title of the movie which goes as "The first was a warning". But in reality the line should be taken as a warning before opting for the movie in the theaters spending both your valuable time and money. Still if you really want to get scared then go for a famous Asian Horror flick instead as the genre is best understood by those film-makers in the entire globe.In the end, I would only like to say that Horror movies not necessarily have to be made revolving around the same repeated idea of a haunted house and a spirit. RGV is still making all these horror movies based on his own old formula adopted in his first attempt in the genre called "Raat" released in 1992. But now it's high time to move on to some new unexplored ideas, at least for the sake of his uncountable fans like myself. Ironically "Raat" still remains his best masterpiece till date, so just go for it if you haven't seen it yet." 
" Senseless ghost, in a senseless movie!","I really don't know where to start. This seems to be one confusing ghost! One moment, she doesn't need to use a body to kill people, at other moments entering into more than one body(even if it's a doll) is not enough to kill! And no clear answer as to what happens to this lady spirit at the end. Lot of scenes in the movie either defy logic or sense.The only redeeming aspect is Amruta Khanvilkar as actor Sudeep's wife and Ahsaas Channa as Sudeep's daughter. Both brought life to their performances. Even Sudeep does a decent job. There's no point talking about the rest as it doesn't matter anyway.Verdict: If released, Phoonk 3 should say - Phoonk 2 retold, with answers!" 
" Amazing","It is awesome, to hell with all those who wrote tripe about this movie it was slow to start with but later on picked up and it is first time in Hindi cinema that the main protagonist dies and evil doesn't lose but is subdued and i feel that is the best part as it doesn't show any fake views but reality that evil cannot be destroyed so cheers RGV for making something new with your new golden boy Mr.Milan Ghadekar. Also i must say that barring 1920 in recent times no horror movie in Indian cinema has shown gore .Also must mention 13b which is also a great movie. With regards to Phoonk2 the camera-work and the shocks are the best i felt scared and i am sure very confidently that without consuming alcohol no one can watch this movie in the hall alone." 
" Now this is a real Horror but with absolutely no logic!!!","I first saw Phoonk 2 years ago,felt it was OK;maybe not as scary as supposed to be.But me and bro were curious to watch the sequel, so watch we did on the BIG SCREEN,and by jove!It really was scary.The story is about Madhu(Ashwini) who returns from the grave to take revenge on Rajiv(Sudeep) and all his loved ones.I don't think it's a huge budget movie-only a small star cast,one can see that not much has been spent.The film moves on a very spooky note,unlike Phoonk. And one point worth noting is that NOTHING HAS BEEN COPIED FROM THE WEST,like many horrors in India do.And the climax keeps one waiting to watch a Phoonk 3. But the film is actually illogical. The makers have simply tried to make something scary. There's so much of unexplained and illogical stuff. Watch it if you want horror.Best seen on the big screen." 
" Worst horror movie ever.","This movie is an insult in the name of horror genre. Not even a second in the movie makes you feel scared and you will waste 106 minutes of your life even thinking to watch it."
