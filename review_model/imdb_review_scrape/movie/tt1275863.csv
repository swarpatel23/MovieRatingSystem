" Awesome Love Story","My friend asked me for the movie, i was not ready to go but he forced me, then i thanked him for his offer. The Movie has a cool Love story. I love romantic movies, but to get the feeling one has to deep to get the inner feeling. Some scenes were such that i can't stop tears from rolling down. It has a wonderful plot, the love story of two generations. Acting was OK. Direction Imtiaz Ali U are cool, all the best for your future projects. Music is good. The lyrics were really touching, it got buried deep inside my heart. The movie is a must watch for ROMANTIC Couple. See the movie you will really change your mind if you are new generation lovers. In My Opinion Love Aaj Kal is one of the best Love Stories I have seen so far.And Please Watch the movie in theaters or buy original DVDs, do not rent it please. Stop Piracy." 
" A good romantic movie for the people who believe in love.....","Hi, This is the third movie from Imtiaz Ali's Direction. I didn't like this movie as his earlier movies. Still i am giving this movie 7 out of 10 because of very good performances of Saif, Deepika, Harleen & other characters but for direction i will give him 10 out of 10.As earlier Imtiaz's movies have lot of comic & funny moments this has very little comic scenes & a lot is focused on Romance. So if you like romantic movies, don't wait & go for it.There is nothing much about the story as it is simple love story a boy & girl in love but didn't realize it. But the most important thing is the combination of two similar stories of different times at very best.At the end it is a good movie will beautiful performances...." 
" A Nutshell Review: Love Aaj Kal","Unlike the complex games people play nowadays, as Jai Vardhan Singh (Saif Ali Khan) and Meera Pandit (Deepika Padukone) engages in. The first few minutes of the film might be a little strange and frustrating even, where it plays out like an advertisement for modern love moving at a breakneck pace of a whirlwind romance. Jai and Meera meet, fall madly in love, spend incredible moments together, only to allow reasons of practicality spoil everything. Since their careers are going to put them thousands of miles apart – Meera heading towards Delhi and Jai dreaming of eventually relocating to San Francisco, having no trust in long distance relationship means the logical decision to break up and remain friends.In the other story, Veer Singh (Saif Ali Khan again) meets and falls in love with Harleen Kaur (newcomer Gisele), but being the old-fashioned Romeo and with a process in place to woo the woman of your dreams, he finds it extremely difficult to break the ice, and only to learn that his task has been made doubly complex with the dimension of distance getting in the way as Harleen's family uproots to Kolkata. Swearing a pledge that he will marry her, and for all lifetimes, he journeys to the other side of India, happy to just catch a glimpse of his lady love. And so begins a very tough courtship of stolen glances and secret rendezvous against stacked up odds of opposition.As a romance, this film has plenty put on its plate. A good looking and charismatic cast, beautiful landscapes and visuals thanks to the jetsetting nature of the story from London to Delhi to Kolkata to San Francisco, and a number of fantastic lines of dialogue sprinkled with a reasonable dose of comedy, and touching moments too. What's there not to like and make you fall in love with the characters, and wring your hand at their predicament, most of which were self-inflicted? Its two stories tell the stark difference between the modern rules of courtship based on practicality, versus that of the more traditional way, though the common thread will always, and has been to follow your heart. The thrill of the chase for instant gratification looks flimsy when set against the old fashioned notion of earning and justifying one's sincerity through action, rather than cheap talk which Saif Ali Khan's Jai is expert at.The song and dance numbers are OK, though personally nothing was memorable enough to have stuck in my head way after the end credits start rolling. There were fun numbers of course where both leads in their modern roles seem to relish in, highlighting their personal, playful nature as they paint the town red in their secret rendezvous without the knowledge of their newfound partners. I thought there would be enough moments for each to showcase the pain of their ill-informed decisions of breaking up, but all we got was from the guy's point of view, and that was very much after the fact, which I felt time would probably start to heal all wounds, unless of course you let little personal details of milestones in your ex's life to come in and disrupt your current lifestyle.Though of course in this story's love found, love lost and love gained, there were set pieces which tests the characters resolve, especially the one where their crazy game of double dating on the sly with their new partners, Jai's Jo (Florence Brudenell-Bruce) and Meera's Vikram (Rahul Khanna), rang through some intense pain and uncomfortable jealousy, providing a cliffhanger for the perennial interval.If there's one thing I dislike and one of the themes as expounded in the film, it's the lack of honesty in the games people play. The romances of old are seemingly simple enough, without facades put up and masks worn to hide true intentions. Contrasted with today's of course, where both Jai and Meera find it too cool to be acknowledging their feelings properly for each other, and go on a round-about journey before they start to realize their true emotions, and face up to them sincerely. Needless to say, between the two stories, I had preferred the older one which is more engaging, honest and wistful even.I felt that this was a classic showpiece for Saif Ali Khan. His more modern role of Jai has plenty of what makes a suave man tick, though with the tendency of lapsing into moments of Attention Deficit Disorder, rambling off in motor mouth fashion in expressing his innermost thoughts, which in a way helped him rationalize the deeply kept emotions in his heart. But the fun factor was of course having him personify the stoic nature of Veer Singh in the 60s, lovelorn and desperate even to battle against all odds to win over his lady love.I'm happy for Deepika to have finally moved away from having to play two roles in every film (save for Bachna Ae Haseeno). Contrary to many synopsis out there, she doesn't play the romantic interest opposite Saif Ali Khan's other role, although of course it would probably make it a tad more interesting, though negating Veer Singh's pledge in a certain way. That would also mean a more conventional reincarnation type story that Imtiaz Ali steered clear of with his treatment here. However, I thought in some ways Gisele as the younger Harleen Kaur had upstaged Deepika's screen presence with her quiet and demure stature, though of course Deepika's asset of having that wonderful "stop-all-traffic" smile got exploited by the director through and through to maximum effect in melting even the most stone cold of all hearts.All in all, Love Aaj Kal didn't manage to hit the heights that its star billing had the potential to, but still came across as a better than average romantic movie that's suitable for a date." 
" Bold, very bold","Imtiaz Ali has made 3 films now - Socha Na Tha, Jab We Met and Love Aaj Kal - he seems to be getting better and better with each film.He seems to be becoming a better director as well as writer with each film.It is very rare to find Hindi films where people talk like people - with conversations having logical conclusions and transitions. This whole film is built on people having conversations and learning about each other and figuring themselves out through these conversations. I remember Siskel & Ebert lamenting on their show that in the movies, people mention that they have professions and yet never seem to be working at their so called job - but in this film, they do. The script - oh the script! Very smart, no dumbing down, no manipulative melodrama. I recently saw (500) Days of Summer and thematically and in tone these two are similar. Also technically, Ali seems to have grown tremendously as a director - he is very good here in terms of shooting on location without getting unnecessarily enamoured or indulgent.This movie has three performances really - Saif, Deepika and Rishi Kapoor. All have done tremendous justice to their characters; they are also very fortunate that the script provided them with 3-dimensional characters. A special mention for the young Brazilian lady who plays Harleen Kaur in the movie - she is so breathtakingly beautiful and very convincingly Indian. The only blemish for me was Pritam's music and the song placement of that twist song. Pritam was so brilliant in Jab We Met that he actually accentuated the viewing pleasure of that film - but here, his music - though not bad - seems to distract from it. As good as this film is, something tells me that Imtiaz Ali is just getting started and that he is a lot more gutsy and genuinely hatke than we have seen so far. And that is a wonderfully scary thought." 
" Love Aaj Kal : Refreshing!","Directed By- Imitiaz AliProduced By- Saif Ali Khan and Dinesh VijanFeaturing- Saif Ali Khan, Deepika Padukone, Rishi Kapoor, Rahul Khanna..The drought of good movies that seemed to have taken over Bollywood from the past few months ends with Love Aaj Kal releasing this week. Directed by Imitiaz Ali, Love Aaj Kal in one word is Fantastic. Keeping his previous stint of success with him Imitiaz Ali has delivered a love story that is narrated in a surprisingly innovative way. Shot in different parts of London, San Francisco, Old-Delhi and Punjab, Love Aaj Kal shows a fantastic blend of two love stories one in the past -"Love Kal" and the other in the present - "Love Aaj" crisscrossed, linking the past to the present.Love Aaj Kal is a cross of two love stories, one of Jai Vardhan Singh( Saif Ali Khan) andMeera Pandit(Deepika Padukone) the other of Veer Singh(Saif Ali Khan/Rishi Kapoor) and Harleen Kaur (Shweta Gulati/Neetu Singh). Jai and Meera two modern independent career oriented people living in London fall in love and as times pass by, decide to break up and move on with their respective careers in a rather happy way with an unusual break up-party unlike other break up's. Here's when he meets Veer Singh (Rishi Kapoor) a owner of a coffee shop, who keeps hinting Jai of the mistakes that he is making considering the break up with Meera. Very soon, Veer Singh( Rishi Kapoor) is then seen narrating his love story with Harleen back in Punjab years ago. The stories of Jai and Veer are then played alternately showing the obvious overlapping instances between both the love stories. The story post Jai's break up and the various fun moments is for you to figure it out yourself.Love Aaj Kal doesn't really disappoint you at any level irrespective of what expectations you had with the movie. The highlight of the movie is the naive love story of Veer and Harleen, that brings with it a lot of innocent-natural-spontaneous moments that you will surely enjoy and relish even after your out of the theater. Beautifully done are the links between the two stories with hint of light humor.Imitiaz Ali has yet again selected and used his resources intelligently. Saif Ali Khan impresses you with both Jai and young Veer's role playing it quite convincingly. Deepika Padukone's performance is average and is definitely impressive in certain parts of the movie. Rishi Kapoor is good and delivers a fun performance. Rahul Khanna is seen on a role thats quiet and there's not much for him in the movie. Debutant Shweta Gulati looks raw with her acting and yet is bang on for the role of Harleen surprisingly making you like her as the movie progresses.The music by Pritam is stupendous and simply one of his best composed albums. The picturisation and the songs compliment each other really well. Tracks like "Chor Bazaari", "Twist", "Yeh Doorian".. being the highlights of the albumImitiaz Ali has literally left no stone unturned to give Love Aaj Kal that classic refreshing feel. I will go with 8 out of 10 for Imitiaz Ali's Love Aaj Kal.Don't miss this flick.Originally Posted at www.raghavthecritic.blogspot.com" 
" Love aaj kal is about the story of a "practical" couple who decide to part rather than maintaining a difficult long-distance relationship...","The title of the story says it all, love aaj kal explores the differences between a couple of today and that of 1965. Saif and Deepika after being in a steady relationship for almost one and a half years decide to break-up just because Deepika has to go to India for her work and Saif is waiting for an offer from an American company. They happily part and stay in touch afterwards. When alone, Saif meets Rishi Kapoor and listens to his love story about how he(Rishi) fell in love with a girl in Delhi without even actually talking to her in 1965. At this point Imtiaz shows the generation gap, and the difference in the view point of a lover of 1965 and a lover of 2009. Saif gets a new girlfriend and deepika too gets a new boyfriend but something somewhere goes wrong.......they are not able to get over each other, but still deepika marries her new boyfriend. In short the movie can be watched at least once for those who are restless when it comes to romantic movies, but for those who love romantic movies should not think of missing this one. If you are expecting a comedy similar to Jab We Met or Socha Na Tha then you may get disappointed as this movie is not a hardcore comedy but there are quite a few good laughs. Imtiaz Ali has proved himself yet again, Saif's comic timing is as usual quite good and the role of Deepika suits her really good. Enjoy this movie...." 
" Simply Superb!","It is for mango people! the dialogue rocks!Simply great movie a truly sensible and for modern lovers. This is a strong film reflects on how the old style of true love is still alive in this generation. It is also strongly appealing that god exists, belief exists and true love existfinally Saif, and Deepika rocks they both share a good chemistry on screen.And of course how can we forget Rishi Kapoor I think he is well tailored for this role A very predictable end but the way it ends is simply superb i think all 'HUM TUM' lovers will like this." 
" Love Is Eternal...Not Aaj-Kal","We are now living into a materialistic world where even the relationships are now built on calculation...but does that mean that the essence of true feelings have gone obsolete? Finding answer of such trivial question would take you a long time unless you want to see a 2+ hours movie called "Love Aaj kal". I am sure now the bells would not ring but definitely in time to come people would realize that the message delivered by the movie is much deeper than what it feels from the first look.This movie is a journey of love from past to present, to convey the message that something doesn't change with the time and at the end one has to follow his/her heart because that's what is the real pursuit of happiness.The story of movie revolves around two protagonists, one from the present and one from past. Only with the glitch of time -frame change, both the stories follows the same path and ultimately ends at the very point where essentially a true love story should end, A happy ending. The only difference in both the stories is the way realization happen, in the one of past the realization is much of obvious where as in the present it's quite melodramatic yet very close to a real life incident which you could see around.Yet after being such serene,pure and refreshing what this movie lacks is the attachment with the characters, you would not be able to connect to the characters as you should, may be the soul of it is missing due to lack of chemistry between the lead actors Saif and Deepika.I wouldn't say they didn't perform well but still I was kind of disconnect to them though I felt more connected to story of past..may be because I still have my faith on age old love sagas :-). I guess the chemistry between Saif-Deepika didn't work as well as it was expected.Performance wise, I guess Deepika was standout of the entire cast, she played her role of straight headed career oriented woman with much of ease and really was completely involved in her role (May be because her traits belongs to the same). Saif was looking much of a confused person not only because his role demanded it but also because may be he was not hitting the right cord along with Deepika. Role played by Rishi Kapoor is fantastic, he was the best fit for the role and the urge, excitement and emotions he portrayed were so true to be real that it always made you feel it was coming right from heart and you would want to follow them. Music is really peppy and catchy, few tunes are foot tapping and there is a very nice soft song "Dooriyan" which would slowly intoxicate you. Cinematography is also very nice and so as direction, the best thing of direction is that Imtiaz never does copy of anyone's style but his improvisation is so nice that he somewhat creates a cult, be it "Socha Na Tha" or "Jab We Met".... you would find people relating themselves to the characters, I am sure this would continue after Love Aaj kal as well. He always come to characters not larger than life but true to life, absolute treat to watch his movies.All in all this is a good bet to spend your money." 
" Back to Bollywood basics, captured in todays reality","The long wait for Bollywood to shake off the shackles of mindless masti is officially over. Long have fans waited in earnest for a movie that would captivate their minds and take them on a journey of love in a way only bollywood knows how. Love Aaj Kal is more than a refreshing foray into long unvisited areas, its a return to the classic principles of a modest and true love.Many films have struggled to portray such stories amidst the backdrop of a modern society and understandably so. Much has changed since the day 'raj' introduced himself to 'simran' on a moving train carriage (DDLJ). But Love Aaj Kal does this to near perfection. The realities of a modern day relationship are brought to intense scrutiny under the principles of old age chivalry and modesty. The result is an enthralling plot where the reconciliation of both unfolds in a most untypical manner. Believe me when I tell you that this story is not typical, nor are the many directions it takes.Locations such as England, the US and India are effectively utilised without resorting to a plethora of scenic shots in an attempt to add to the films credibility. The flashbacks themselves are tastefully created, giving the audience a breath of fresh air whilst carrying the story to its much appreciated climax. The story, the dialogue and the camera work combine brilliantly and give the film a sense of professionalism and artistic sense, both of which appear to be lacking in most of the movies being churned out by the industry.The acting is brilliant. Saif manages to find a middle ground between the charismatic 'nickhil' (salam namaste) and the intensity of 'Ishwar' (Om Kara), thus demanding empathy and guaranteeing laughs. Deepika proves her credentials as an actress in this film, her beauty already a forgone conclusion. Rishi Kapoor is an ever-reliable foil to the young protagonist (Saif) and guides the movie well. Lastly, the actress playing 'Harleen' also deserves recognition. Much pressure must have been placed on the young girl who had to shoulder the responsibility of a story parallelling that of stars such as Saif and Deepika. But this she handled with aplomb. She was more than believable as 'Harleen' and perfect for the plot's intentions of a modest romance. A slight qualm of mine is the western actress chosen to play 'Jo', whose acting was the usual unconvincing performance that is becoming commonplace in Indian movies with westerners (Lagaan the exception). A better character and actress could no doubt have been sought.I recommend this film to all who wish to see what emotions a bollywood love story is capable of invoking. The 90's brought with it the melodious love of DDLJ, yet it is in 2009 that bollywood brings a practical love story equally capable of capturing our imaginations." 
" Ordinarily extraordinary","Once again Imtiaz Ali manages to transform an ordinary love story into an extraordinary experience. Quite like his previous film 'Jab we met', the actual story of this movie isn't exceptional, but he manages to portray it in such an interesting way that you are left in awe.The story begins with a very happy couple Jai ( Saif Ali Khan ) and Meera ( Deepika Padukone ) who get along unusually well with each other. But once Meera has to leave the country for good because of her work, they mutually and gladly decide to break up for the fear of not being able to handle a long distance relationship. This happens in a coffee shop owned by an old man Veer ( Rishi Kapoor ) who takes a keen interest in their affair and decides to find out more. Once Jai opens up to him, Veer confesses that he was quite like Jai in his own time. This is when, bit by bit, Veer starts revealing to Jai his own love story. Initially Jai finds Veer's thinking and approach very amusing. But as his life continues, he sees an uncanny reflection of his own love life in Veer's decades old love story. The whole plot of the movie revolves around the events and happenings in Jai and Meera's life thereon with a delicate backdrop of Veer's love life and its relevance to their life.The beauty of this film lies in the portrayal and comparison of these two parallel love stories. The basic idea of the film is to show how, even though approaches and ideologies have changed over the years, 'love' as a concept still remains the same no matter what era. The striking resemblances yet the subtle differences between Jai and Veer's love stories are shown brilliantly.All the actors have done a commendable job in the movie. Saif Ali Khan, specially did a fantastic job playing both 'young Veer' and Jai. Deepika Padukone was upto the mark and Rishi Kapoor was impeccable as usual. The music of the movie deserves a special mention. Pritam has done an outstanding job once again with "Aahun Aahun" and "Yeh Dooriyan" probably being the pick of the lot.All in all a great fun film to watch! Highly recommended." 
" Watched twice already!!!!","After so many years at last there is movie which can be more than once. Saif Ali khan has tried his best 9/10 for him .He can still work on his Punjabi.Deepika Padukone very heavy accent for a British .She should neutralize her thick Bombay-type accent for her own good. If you live outside India you can relate more to this movie. Rishi Kapoor is brilliant as usual. and for Imtiaz Ali , He has some special thing for Punjabi and turbans. He has done a great job with this movie. 10/10 .Great sense of humor running through the movie. MANGO PEOPLE..Movie has a Hollywood feel when it starts ,which can be a negative for some audience but later it . Overall not your average mas-ala movie, you need some overseas exposure to understand the concept and idea behind this flick" 
" Grows on you as it goes by, but still remains uninspiring and predictable.","I was quite disappointed by Imtiaz Ali's Love Aaj Kal. So much hype before and after release, and for what? For an ordinary story with nothing new to offer. The film is light and simple, but while in some cases these are the good qualities of a film, in this case, these are actually the film's pitfalls. There is actually no real story to speak of, and the film is slow-paced and at times simply boring. Love Aaj Kal is about a young guy named Jai who just ended his relationship with his girlfriend Meera. He then meets a mature Sardar named Veer Singh who tells him of his own story. From then on, the past and the present run concurrently. Saif Ali Khan plays Jai, and in the flashbacks, he plays the young Veer, whose older version is played by Rishi Kapoor. This kind of narrative style is not one to my liking, but it could have been more interesting had it been used and treated differently. For one, I could not understand why Ali had to cast Khan to play the young Rishi Kapoor. If there was some family connection between the characters of Veer and Jai, it would be more tolerable. Also, one has to note that there is absolutely zero resemblance between Khan and Kapoor, which makes it quite odd that the former played the younger version of the latter.The film is not unwatchable by any means, but it is just not a film I personally would want to watch again. There are good things about it, no doubt, but they cannot save the story from being stale and uninspiring. The songs are quite nice to listen to, particularly "Yeh Dooriyan", which is wonderfully sung by Mohit Chauhan, and "Aaj Din Chadheya". The entire soundtrack really fits the film's mood. Saif Ali Khan repeats his young, carefree Don Juan role as Jai. His character has shades of Karan from Hum Tum (according to me his career-best), where he played a modern, cool and kind-hearted womaniser. Khan in an actor of unmatched comic talent, and though he is a bit old to play a character of this sort, here too he performs well and successfully portrays his character's gradual growth. The problem is, as said, casting him in the role of the young Veer. A younger actor would be a more interesting choice for the part. Deepika Padukone is an extremely pretty and attractive lass, and her smile lights up the screen, but something is missing there. Though she does well in some sequences, she fails to register the growth in her character. Rishi Kapoor is wonderful as Veer Singh, Rahul Khanna is okay as Vikay, and Giselle Monteiro is decent as Harleen.Love Aaj Kal has some nice sequences. It was quite funny to see Jai and Meera celebrating their separation, and then regretting it after realising their true feelings for each other. The dialogues are good for the most part. Loved the scene in which Jo, Jai's new girlfriend who is played by a foreign beauty called Florence Brudenell-Bruce, decides to leave him as she notices his indifference towards their relationship. The film can be an entertaining watch with family and friends, though towards the end it has its share of clichés and becomes very predictable. After watching a charming and entertaining piece like Jab We Met, I had high expectations from this Imtiaz Ali film. Unfortunately, in this one the chemistry between the leads is missing, and though the film grows on you as it nears the end, it ends up being worthy of just a one-time watch. I am sure Ali is capable of making much more than just an ordinary love story like this one. Hope he does so in the future." 
" Of the Mango People","The three films that Imtiaz Ali has directed so far have a common theme running through them - the protagonists do not realize that they are in love till the very end. In all three the real drama is not in how the lovers meet or fall in love or the peripheral characters (like family or friends). It is about realization. That he does it successfully third time in a row probably tells that Imtiaz Ali either feels very strongly about the concept or that he has had some real life experience of his own.Love Aajkal starts with Jai (Saif) and Meera (Deepika) breaking up. They are apparently very practical about their relationship and plan it such that it goes along with their other plans for life. Only that life, as always, has plans of its own. The more time they spend away from each other, the more they realize they are meant to be together. To catalyze the Jai's end of the realization process we have an amiable old café owner, Veer (Rishi Kapoor). Veer's love story in flashback is a parallel track to Jai-Meera's. Both the stories run juxtaposed with each other to a predictable but nevertheless heart warming climax.Saif plays both Jai and the young Veer. He is top notch in both roles. Flambouyance comes naturally to him when he plays Jai and he is very convincing as the rugged and (at times) clumsy Veer. Deepika is at ease in the role of Meera. It seems as if she is playing herself. At the dramatic scenes, however, like the one immediately after her marriage where she is impatient to talk to Jai, and the scene following that when she is talking to Jai over the phone, she betrays that she still needs to learn the ropes. She looks stunning in every frame. Perfect foil to the glamorous Meera is the docile and beautiful Harleen. She is pretty as a picture, though she hardly speaks in the entire film.Imtiaz Ali is an inspired director. He knows his characters and his story. He is more focused on technique this time, compared to Jab We Met or Socha Na Tha. I guess that is because he was aware that he has a weaker story in hand. He handles the two tracks brilliantly, managing to keep both engaging. His editor delivers the goods for him to achieve that. A noteworthy good work by the editor is the sequence at the beginning where we see the cast and crew credits. It is a collage of scenes from the complete film.The songs go well with the film (though with Pritam, I don't know how much of it is original). The background score could have been more imaginative.Love Aajkal is easily the best romantic comedy of the year so far. Worth watching." 
" Love aaj kal-worst movie of the year","Yesterday i went to this much hyped movie and i am sorry to say i was really very disappointed...The movies starts off in a good manner but as it moves you will laugh because at one moment you will find Saif ali khan in India and in the very next scene you will find him in U.K or U.S...The story in the past isn't good at all...There are hardly 4-5 scenes of it...I expected a lot from this movie especially after watching Jab we Met i thought this director is a man to watch out...But Love aaj kal is a kind of movie which looks as if the script's every second page was tared and the director just made the film just for the sake of making...The performances aren't good either...Saif ali khan as always plays a cool dude kind of man(He is now 39, he should try something different)...Deepika Padukone is OK(Its because of her i gave 1 star to this movie)...The direction is terrible...The songs are good but they start when they aren't required...God knows what Imtiyaz Ali was thinking while directing it...I don't know how critics gave it 3-4 stars out of 5 while it deserves only a half or 1 star...All in all watch this movie if you want to waste your money...." 
" Enjoyed it, loved it, 10 on 10 but that's me, I love romantic movies but BF thought otherwise","Okay, here's my first review ever. I loved this movie so much that I was actually inspired to write a review for the first time in my life and I gave it a 10 on 10. Me and my boyfriend went to the cinemas without really deciding on what to see before hand and it was only when we were there I thought maybe Love Aaj Kal as I have a crush on Saif! ha ha and BF thinks Deepika is gorge. I didn't really expect it would be that good. The cinema was a bit odd, the projectionist must have been drunk because the pictures appeared elongated and the first scene was Saif and Deepika appearing with their heads off the screen. This got fixed a minute later and then the story started. I have to say I was really hooked on the story, the characters were really well thought out. Without revealing too much Saif plays a typical confused young guy, Deepika's character was a typical young girl, she played it very well, bubbly at times and restrained at others. This is a story about young couples and how destiny and life in general pulls them apart and then together again. Confused feelings, paths in life, career and priorities in life over love, covers it all. The most interesting bit is the other story of the old couple, Rishi Kapoor, another favorite of mine which was absolutely touching and emotional. There are two stories over different time lines. I think this is one of the most impressive movies to come out of Bollywood.Didn't think too much of the songs, some were catchy but not particularly.But BF thought it was average which was kind of odd and makes me wonder if it's actually more of a chick flick. He says he did enjoy it but then when we talked about it, he felt that the last 20 minutes was stretched out. On the contrary I was totally into the last 20 minutes more than the whole film. I thought it was really crucial to the whole plot, I can't go into it as it would be a spoiler but it's something we've debated about.This is a romantic movie that will be enjoyed by everyone in the family, highly recommend it, 10 out of 10!" 
" Amazing","one of the most amazing movie i have come across, one of the reason is that it resembles to my life as well but still great performance by everyone and i still watch it despite of this movies being old... Saif, Deepika Rishi sir all gave their best performance i'd say 9.5 out of 10. really good presentation.. one must watch this movie. highly recommended"
