" It is completely tiger shroff's movie","When i first saw the trailer of the movie i thought that Tiger shroff is trying to ape salman khan but no he isn't trust me you can watch this movie for Mr.shroff alone .He carries the whole movie on his shoulders .He is the best thing that can happen to this movie .And i can say that this movie had a promising debut What is good about the movie ? Like i said tiger shroff is the soul of the movie .His dance,style and fights adds great attraction to the movie .He has the potential and can deliver hits .I think we will be hearing more of Mr.shroff .His versatility is praiseworthy . Music of the movie is fantastic .The script is pretty decent .But bollywood should stop relying on south Indian movie scripts What is bad about the movie ? Well apart from Mr.Shroff none of the actors deliver .Prakash raj did a convincing job but he needs to work on the dialog delivery .Kirti sanon has just been a pretty face in the movie and doesn't do much in the movie except for playing a damsel in distress . I would give this movie 7/10 one star for Mr.Shroff" 
" Dear Critics! Frankly speaking.....I did not like it dear","With enough criticism written, I would like to rub some more salt before you dare to even watch this one......This is Indian film industry's tradition that film fraternity writes and says only good things about any new entrant from their Khaandan, this time they are also carrying on this legacy and you can find that every critic and film personality is giving this more "3-4 stars" out of five. All I can say most of them have sold their soul and not only their profession, after 5 star to Kkrish-3 incident I have completely lost my faith.OK now lets talk about the movie, Everything about this movie was wrong the script, screenplay, the main actor and actresses except the song and Prakash Raj. They claim that movie's budget is Rs 35 Cr, well I don't see anything in the movie where they have actually invested as whole star-cast is fresh and I don't think if they charge crores, but you can guess that most of the fund was reserved for marketing and Critics fees.Now come to the story, then this is another South Indian Movie with heavy forgettable "Sadak Chaap" dialogue and running, jumping with non-sense fight scenes.We all know about weird look of Tiger Shroff, but it was disappointing to know that this chap is really good Gymnast and he may win few Olympic medals for the country but his family is more interested to force him to choose Acting career. This lad is completely emotionless and his expressions are flat, his dialogue delivery does not leave any impact on the audience,I was not expecting a great demonstration of acting skills from him and he even does not surprise us either. Director tried to create a new fusion of Gymnastic Abilities and Music but it's not very convincing or entertaining, Tiger Shroff did as much as 50-60 "flips", his "flips" are the only talent they were trying to show us, whether it was fight or dance scene, "FLIPS" were everywhere, after watching the whole movie they successfully convinced us that he can actually "Flip". And now about Actress, all I can say I may not recognize her if I see her in another movie because there is nothing for her but just to dance with hero and shed tears by using glycerin. My advice to you is that just watch video songs on the YouTube and you can skip the movie as there is nothing more entertaining than the songs. It's already available for free, no need to spend money. Please remember that Tiger Shroff can "Flip", Yes! he can actually "Flip", Oh God he "Filped Again", It's really Awesome that he can "flip", OMG how adorable he is flipping again. "THE FLIP" Rest choice is your! Make your own judgment. Note: English is not my First language." 
" "Let Me Tell You A Story For The nth Time." ♦ 41%","So, the story goes like this: boy falls for a girl, girl has a strict father, girl's sister has eloped with boy's best friend, boy helps best friend in hiding, boy impresses father, boy over-impresses father, girls HAS to love him, father agrees, credits. No prizes for guessing, but this is what Heropanti is.The only difference is they gave the two lead roles to newbies. Tiger Shroff may have good parkour skills and a super bod, but his face resembles a 10-year old and trust me, this aggravates his acting. Let him grow and we'll see if he's really an actor material. Kriti Sanon is cute and can hide behind a stick; she acts fine but nothing remarkable. Supporting cast is fine.The plot goes out of bounds sometimes when reality loses grip and the scenes just show the writers' vivid imagination; e.g.: highbrow hooligans are intimidated by the the hero's witty dialogs which are funnier than they are descriptive. Also, Shroff's over-smart air pops up clearly during tense dramatic sequences.Then the whole drama is tried to save with the help of humor but that doesn't work much either. Action is good, songs are good, cinematography is good. But, since it solely depends on tried-tested formula, Heropanti is just average.BOTTOM LINE: Take your girlfriend with you if X-Men is not running nearby. It has its few moments. Can be skipped.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES" 
" Forced action, stuffed songs and without required emotions","For direction I just want to reframe the tag line of this film as "Direction- Kisi Ko Aati Nahi, Kisi Ko Milti Nahi" . Director just fails to add anything extra from his side to enhance the film. Even lots of places, for the sake of surprise he gives shock to audience. Story is very routine, screenplay is stale and dialogues are just OK. They show capital of India, Delhi just like a remote village. I mean to say no law and order, goons moving in open jeep!!! Why they prefer to choose Delhi when it could have been any place. Main male lead behaves like he does not have mind at all, when ever he wants to fight , he fights otherwise he surrenders or even plans to run away!!! Love scenes between the lead pair do not touch at all. This is the biggest setback of this action romantic film. Prakash Raj is an amazing actor but due to inappropriate visual support and routine dialogues his emotional scenes fall flat even after his mind blowing performance. Sunil Grover, famous as Gutthi comes in a scene and pushes you to laugh but this scene was intended to be emotional rather than funny. Performance wise Tiger Shroff as Bablu fights and dances impressively but he is just fine in other scenes. Kirti Sanon as Dimpy is OK. Samar Jay singh as Bhuppi makes his presence felt. Music by Sajid –Wajis is good. Choreography of song Whistle Baja is out standing." 
" Perhaps the era of adorable romance with an emotional depth is over.","Watching this latest launching pad for another star son, presented as a youthful love saga, I strongly felt that perhaps we are now into a completely different era which is far away of those eternal love stories of the past. The emotional depth found in the adorable romance between the lead pairs of that golden era is lost somewhere in the materialistic development around and today a love story has to be served like a complete entertainment package, forcing everything into the script ranging from action, songs, dance & drama to six packs, naval shows and hurriedly edited sequences with more than one sub plots.Another remake of another South Hit PARUGU (Telugu-2008), HEROPANTI has been made with slight changes suiting the Hindi belt. But it actually walks on exactly the same pattern followed by South cinema, in which they mix more than 2-3 interesting subplots into one script and have a separate focus planned for both before and after the interval, intelligently. So in here too the couple actually meets just before the intermission and its probably the first Hindi love story in which the wooing act commences in the second half.Beginning with a typical marriage sequence and many clichéd insertions later, it simply reminds you of few recent films like CHENNAI EXPRESS, SON OF SARDAR, RANGREZZ and more. The hero's gang of friends starts overacting from their first scene itself and one doesn't get impressed much till we have an well executed chase & escape, action sequence towards the mid. Despite having few weird scenes, the film actually makes a greater impact post interval with an emotional climax again reminding you of DDLJ along with a lengthy duration which could have been shortened by at least 12-15 minutes. To put it straight, HEROPANTI is purely made keeping in mind the non- stop entertainment more suitable for single screens or smaller centers and has enough action & drama for that particular target audience. Hence it cannot be treated as an awfully made film, delivering nothing. However it's the writing which remains uneven throughout offering some really strange sequences as well as dialogues. For instance, it seems really silly to repeat the word HEROPANTI every 5-10 minutes by various artists in its initial hour. Prakash Raj coming on to the road with a bottle as a drunkard didn't really suit his own persona. A party song comes from no-where in the film all of a sudden and a particular dialogue truly left me confused saying, "Jo Dost Kameeney Nahin Hotey, Wo Kameenay Dost Nahi Hotey!!!!!!"Also another verse in the song "Rabba" really forced me to look into the lyrics writer's name i.e. Kausar Munir and he writes, "Chakhna Bhi Chahun, Rakhna Bhi Chahun, Sabse Chhupa Ke Ussey!!!!!!" And that is supposed to be a love song.really!Musically, HEROPANTI does have some peppy tracks like "Raat Bhar" & "Whistle Baja" with the famous signature tune from Subhash Ghai's HERO featuring Tiger's father Jackie Shroff, fondly called as Jackie Dada. Moreover the encouraging part is that here we don't have a 5-6 songs thrown in every 12-15 minutes into the film as per the routine. The cinematography captures the action sequences and landscapes superbly. Plus the background score manages to build up the energy level to a large extent.In the performance section, Tiger Shroff confidently displays his well learned skills in Gymnastics & Martial Arts and makes a decent impact. He puts up a notable show as an actions hero for sure but remains average only in the acting department frankly. Having said that he is certainly not an extremely poor actor as was being predicted and made fun of in the social networking sites before the release. Still, his chocolate (girly) looks, not suitable for variety of roles, are sure to prove as a big limitation in his career without any doubt. Also I would not be able to call Tiger's dare devil stunts as something first of its kind on the screen, since just last year we saw Vidyut Jammal coming up with a much better stuff in his COMMANDO (2013). But since he is not any star-son with a solid backing, so many would not even recall his name & the film unfortunately.Kriti, who has earlier worked in a Telugu hit looks really gorgeous and plays her given role with an extreme ease as well as confidence. With a highly likable screen presence, she is sure to win many hearts post HEROPANTI and also would be the one who will get the maximum benefit from the film in the coming months. Sandeepa Dhar is fine as Kriti's elder sister (who also strangely vanishes towards the end) and the supporting cast has some mixed performers ranging from bad to average.Coming to the other big name in the film, Prakash Raj, the seasoned actor once again delivers a 'seen before' yet thoughtful performance of a father who is confused from the rebellious choices made by his two daughters repeatedly. Though this particular section of the movie (the last 15 minutes) could have become its major highlight, if handled more sensitively, yet I loved the important question raised by a caring father of a girl to her chosen boy as, "What exceptional qualities she sees in you which I am unable to see or find?"Summing up, no doubt HEROPANTI is just another average package of entertainment in a pure South style with all routine stuff. Still, it remains one step ahead than many careless entertainers such as R RAJKUMAR. To give you a clear indication we earlier used to make HERO and now it has all gone down to HEROPANTI." 
" Pargu was better but a decent entertainer... Tiger and Kriti are STARS!!!!","Chaudhary (Prakash raj) is a respectable elder in a town and his elder daughter (sandeepa) puts him in embarrassment as she elopes with her lover just minutes before marriage. Chaudhary sends his men to track the man who took his daughter and in this process they catch hold of Bablu (tiger shroff). Meanwhile, Bablu falls for Dippy (kriti), Chaudhary's younger daughter. What happens from there forms the rest.The director has come up with a predictable storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was great. The dialogues were neat. The script was okay and the screenplay brought some great energy. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was efficient and contributed strongly. Editing okay but was not good during the second half. Costumes were trendy and stylish while the art department was appealing. Tiger Shroff was excellent in dance and action sequences . Kriti Sanon is a stunning beauty with very expressive face, she has potential. Prakash Raj was perfect. Sandeepa Dhar was good, Vikram Singh was okay. Others didn't have much to do.The film is the remake of the Telugu hit movie Parugu and it must be said that few changes have been made to suit the taste of the north Indian audience. Also, the focus was more on action quotient than emotional quotient. The first half goes on a lighter mode with elements of romance, some comedy and action. The interval bang was superb and the second half had a good amount of drag before the climax. Overall, this film is a good enjoyable masala entertainer, with a hint of romance,action, and comedy. A decent entertainer.6.5/10" 
" After a boring first-half, the second-half surprises you!","'Heropanti' starts off well, then drops down extremely. The first 20 minutes, up until Tiger Shroff's entry (after his entry) the film goes quite downhill and then becomes a bit boring. As the film goes on, it gets more and more boring, until the first half finishes.The film overall has a clichéd, old, many times used story, but has been changed around a little to make it more exciting, and in my opinion, has worked. The first-half as I mentioned before, is quite boring and will probably make you want to stop watching the film, but as soon as the second-half starts, the film goes back up and gets more and more exciting as it goes on.Performances are decent, though the main highlight of the film in my opinion performance-wise, is Prakash Raj. He probably gives his best performance in Bollywood so far. After him, Tiger Shroff ranks as the best performance of the film I'd say.On the whole, Heropanti is an exciting, fun & entertaining romance-action flick that you may enjoy, depending on what genre films you like. What lets down is the old & washed-out storyline in my opinion. Despite this, if you feel you may enjoy this film, watch if you want to." 
" Awesome Movie after a loooong time!","All right guys & gals...Disclaimer : If you are the serious types, going to a movie theater or even downloading a movie from the internet which is again serious or has a lot of drama or too much romance or even too much of violence; Heropanti is not for you. Sabbir Khan (Director) has recreated a sort or late 80s-early 90s era in his 2nd directorial venture. His earlier movie; Kambhakkt Ishq was total CRAP. But Heropanti is a fantastic improvement. Direction, cinematography, choreography, music everything is good. This movie is a TTP {TOTAL TIME PASS} movie. When you enter the movie hall, you should leave behind all your worries of your life, go in with a clear mind & do not pay too much attention to small details. This movie has a lot to offer to the diversified audience. Action, Romance, Drama, Dance, Emotional Moments, Fantastic Music & a very attractive lead pair. This movie does have some sexist jokes which should be taken in a light manner as it is NOT gross or vulgar in any way. Plot is good, set in modern day Haryana. Although it is copy of the Telugu Film "PARUGU" (Veerta: The Power). See it for the amazing stunts done by Tiger Shroff, the utterly gorgeous Kriti Sanon, Prakash Raj in a different look than his usual gangster character. Emotions are also portrayed beautifully by Prakash Raj & Tiger Shroff. Overall, its a Bollywood entertainer with a fresh cast & good content. Go for it!!" 
" Like father, not like son (In short, bad movie)","Looks like the director of this movie has learnt the wrong meaning of the term 'HERO'. In which way does the slim, skinny, fair and lovely Tiger Shroff looks like a hero? He cannot even live up to his name - Tiger. Hero is supposed to have massive dialogue delivery which can attract the audience. Tiger's dialogue delivery was so unmanly. Not at all impressive. Speaking of the movie, the script and the directions, its all the old wine in a new bottle. Not every superstar son can survive in this industry. And this metrosexuality has taken turn for a worst, is what I have observed after watching tiger shroff. I think Sajid Nadiadwala should do a crash course in 'How to recognize the real actor'." 
" Movie Preview","Heropanti Typical Bollywood action- romance debut film of Tiger shorff Son of 90's leading actor of Bollywood Jakie shroff . The movie is typical Bollywood movie it deal in the important issue of ever Banned love marriage in Traditional families but in very much Comical way. The Hero of the movie is kind of martial art freak more in bone crushing and less at acting. The is a one timer and luckily the depth of the character in the movie will not Bore you . Viewer might fell that ending can be much interesting but Happy ending that all you got in a Bollywood Movie.The leading lady of the movie Kirti Sanon has done a pretty Decent work.As Movie name suggested it is a hero based movie who deals with 10-20 men at once. As a Debutant Both the actor work can be Praised, Movie is likely to get a Hit tag. The romantic song Rabba filmed in Kashmir create a good rhythm in the movie. THE film is a family movie which deals with youth to the parents Emotions in nice way." 
" Heropanti-a good film with a message","Tiger Shroff,son of Jacky Shroff has successfully managed to be a hero and show his heropanti with this film.The film is a dosage of masala with action,comedy,romance and also a message for all,which makes it a good and watchable film.The film has its main strength in its writing. Although it has managed to be good at several places,it fails to rise above Allu Arjun starrer Parugu,of which it is a remake,since Tiger Shroff does not do it like Allu Arjun.But anyhow,it is a tiger Shroff show all the way.Prakash Raj is good as always.Others are also good.The fights and music are very good and worth praise.On the whole,Heropanti is a full on film that can be watched by masala and drama lovers both." 
" A Good Entertainer!","A remake of the 2008 Telugu film Parugu, 'Heropanti' is A Good Entertainer, that introduces two new-faces, Veteran Actor Jackie Shroff's Son Tiger & Kriti Sanon. And luckily, the new-comers pack a punch! 'Heropanti' Synopsis: When Renu (Sandeepa Dhar) runs away with her lover, her father Chaudhary (Prakash Raj) launches a manhunt to track them down and eliminate them. A livid Chaudhary soon discovers that Bablu (Tiger Shroff) is the man who has assisted the couple to elope & who also happens to be his daughter's lover's friend.'Heropanti' is unabashedly aimed at the masses. Its an out-and-out commercial masala film, that offers everything that will be loved by the aam-junta. In short, a paisa-vasool entertainer, that aims for nothing else, but to entertain its viewer.The Screenplay is interesting & well-paced, but there are a few shortcomings. While the first-hour moves with force, the second-hour is comparatively slow. The culmination, especially, is prolonged & doesn't leave much of an impact. Even the running-time for that matter of fact, could've been trimmed by at least 20-minutes. 146-Minutes seems a bit too long! Sabir Khan has directed the film well. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is fair. Action-Sequences/Stunts are tremendous! Music by Sajid-Wajid & Manj Musik, is fabulous. Performance-Wise: Tiger makes an impressive debut. He's superb when it comes to doing action & dance. His impeccable flexibility & grace are impossible to ignore. However, his performance has a few rough edges. He certainly needs to work on his acting skills. But for a debut-performance, he shows potential. Kriti Sanon, also makes an impressive debut. She looks gorgeous & delivers a highly confident performance. Also, the on-screen paring of Tiger & Kriti, is exciting. Prakash Raj is first-rate. His emotional outburst in the second-hour, is brilliant. Sandeepa Dahr leaves a mark. Vikram Singh is effective in a brief role.On the whole, 'Heropanti' works & welcomes two talented newbies - Tiger Shroff & Kirti Sanon." 
" Surprisingly good!","I watched Heropanti on a flight - because I had seen all the other Bollywood fare on offer that day. I was not expecting much but it was surprisingly good!Tiger Shroff has done a brilliant job; credit to this young lad on his debut film. In stills he looks overly effeminate but in the motion picture, he is very much Jackie Chan in the making. Apart from the well choreographed fight sequences, he has also portrayed his role well. I can imagine he must be the heart throb of a whole host of young ladies out there.This film essays the real life horror of honour killings prevalent in certain parts of our country, though in a toned down way and with a happy ending in this case. I wish they had somehow sent a strong message out that honour killings are wrong. Some sections might probably have objected - and in India it is very easy to object to any and everything. Another good message is the highlighting of the trauma that parents go through when their daughters suddenly run away and elope.I do not like violence, but I have to admit that the fight sequences were brilliantly choreographed. Tiger performed very well indeed.This is a good movie, racy, well enacted, with an interesting story line. Go watch!" 
" Heropanti tries the same old formulae, but Tiger Shroff definitely adds some freshness to it.","Heropanti, debut film for both the two main protagonists Tiger Shroff (Jacky Shroff's son) and Kriti Sanan (she has worked in south earlier), has a concept very much seen and heard off. It is being rumoured that Heropanti is remake of Telugu superhit movie Parugu. It showcases the conservative families where parents are having tremendous love towards their children and also very protective. But parents' love vanishes the moment they learn about their child's desire to get married against their wishes. And if elopement happens, then the frantic search of the couple by the family begins; not to accept them but to kill them (known as 'Honour Killing' in our society, although there is nothing honourable at all in this). For the whole life, parents try to bring up their children without letting them know any troubles. All they want is that they should grow up and never become a threat to their status. Parents are just concerned about the well-being of their children and in their language, they can never ever think anything bad for their children. But when it comes to an important decision of life like marriage, parents don't even bother to involve their children, rather end up imposing their desires upon the children. As parents, we must make our children competent enough to take decisions of their lives, we must facilitate them to choose the right life partner in an open communication environment, cannot afford to have autocratic approach and impose decisions upon them. The plot did remind me of Rangrezz and Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge at times.The movie begins with the introduction of Chaudhary Suraj Singh (Prakash Raj), his brothers Bhuppi Bhai, Pappi Bhai and other family members who have all gathered for the marriage of Renu, elder daughter of Chaudhary (Sandeepa Dhar). Chaudhary Suraj's Haweli is in the Jat-land, where loud moments viz. shero-shayari, videography, song-dance, boozing etc. are all shown. The celebration in the air changes into gloom mood, when Renu elopes with her boyfriend Rakesh (Devanshu Sharma). And there starts the head-hunting for the family and relatives of Rakesh who could let Renu's family know about their whereabouts. Finally Rakesh's three friends become the target, Bablu (Tiger Shroff) being one of them. Bablu has been given a smashing entry in the movie with some good fist-moving- action shots when Renu's relatives come to grab him, right out of his gym. Bablu and his two friends are locked up in Chaudhary's haveli along with one more NRI person (who was captured just because he was wearing red jeans and the astrologer had predicted that someone in red trousers might know about the whereabouts of Renu and Rakesh). Bablu is pleasantly surprised to find her 'love at first sight' girl at Chaudhary's residence – Chirpy Dimpy, second daughter of Chaudhary (Kriti Sanan), but it takes almost the first half to explore his girl in that Jat-land. Does Dimpy accept Bablu's love ? She knows that one step out of the tradition would fetch her lot of challenges from her family, so, how does she move further ? What happens when the family learns about Bablu's love for Dimpy? Does Dimpy's family ever set Bablu and his friends free?We have seen such plots many times in the past. What I felt was that the presentation missed punches. Love between Bablu and Dimpy is not developed properly. But yes, the plot tries to highlight both the versions – the reasoning for the rage of a father whose daughter elopes and also the youngsters' reasoning behind wanting the freedom to choose their life partners. Director has wisely avoided any honour-killing scene and he touches this core issue in a very sensitive manner.While watching the movie, I observed certain errors (though minor in nature) which could have been very well avoided. When Bablu and his friends are hit and tortured, in one frame, their face is bruised, but then the face is bruise free in the succeeding frame. Dimpy mentions Rakesh as Rajesh in one of her dialogue. The dialogue by Bablu (in regard to his Heropanti): Sabko Aati Nahi and Meri Jaati Nahi" is a bit overused in the movie, but probably to justify the title. Tiger Shroff has got a good Launchpad to showcase his excellent dancing, action skills. Though, I felt, he is less convincing in the frames where he has to emote and express. His action scenes have shades of Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgan; his shirtless moments remind us of Salman Khan, and his dancing skills are fabulous, which has shades of Hrithik Roshan. Kriti Sanan, although does not have much to do, looks cute and charming in many frames. As debutantes, they have done pretty decent work, and we should not ignore them." 
" One time watch",""No picture can hold my interest when the leading man's bust is bigger than the leading lady's."Many years ago Groucho Marx gave this reason for not seeing Samson And Delilah. Such is the case for Heropanti. For all his antics on screen, Groucho was considered exceedingly wise. So is this logic of his still applicable on Heropanti? Read onAh, the star kids of Bollywood. Producers believe they are born with the charisma, talent and skills that their parents often worked entire lifetimes to create. So they pump in big bucks to create movies that showcase them, success is anyways taken for granted. The easiest thing to add is a ribbed physique, followed by dancing skills, and action chops, so most of the promotional trailers, and half the launch movie focus on these three aspects. As far as acting and a decent script goes, they take a distant backseat. People come in to the theaters enticed by the promos, and anyways a good first weekend more or less ensures the ubiquitous 100 crores. Having said that, I found plenty to like about Heropanti.First is the background- honor killings. People up North are familiar with this heinous concept applicable to in certain societies to people marrying out of caste. When Renu runs away with her lover, her father Chaudhary (Prakash Raj) launches a manhunt to track them down. He discovers Bablu (Tiger Shroff) who is his daughter's lover's friend, might have assisted them escape. Bablu pretends to help him, but falls in love with Chaudhury's other daughter- Dimpy (Kriti Sanon). The rest of the story revolves around how the lead pair come together amidst much mas-ala and emotion- think of it as a mix of papa Shroff's Hero and the eternal DDLJ.The two débutantes do a decent job. Agreed Tiger Shroff as a star is as clichéd as they come. Gruff on the outside but with a heart of gold, chiseled frame, he fights with style, and dances gracefully. Acting is a different matter altogether. He delivers his lines with monotony, and perhaps smiles too much at the camera. Kriti Sanon reminds us of a younger Raveena Tandon. Since the movie is all about Tiger's Heropanti, she gets precious little to do- except look good and play dumb. For once Prakash Raj is not doing his usual over the top act. He puts in a convincingly nuanced performance of a father straddling the line between tradition and affection. Other characters offer comedic elements to liven up things in a feudal Haryanvi backdrop that is decidedly dreary.Director Sabbir Khan, while trying to make a mas-ala entertainer, makes sure to hammer in a reminder of Tiger's lineage by ensuring a background score that is essentially from Hero. Pity though, Heropanti's music is not even half as good as Hero. It is an OK one time watch. Let us see where Tiger goes from here. Word of advice for him- get a mustache, son!" 
" It is completely tiger shroff's movie","With enough criticism written, I would like to rub some more salt before you dare to even watch this one......This is Indian film industry's tradition that film fraternity writes and says only good things about any new entrant from their Khaandan, this time they are also carrying on this legacy and you can find that every critic and film personality is giving this more "3-4 stars" out of five.

They claim that movie's budget is Rs 35 Cr, well I don't see anything in the movie where they have actually invested as whole star-cast is fresh and I don't think if they charge crores, but you can guess that most of the fund was reserved for marketing and Critics fees.Now come to the story, then this is another South Indian Movie with heavy forgettable "Sadak Chaap" dialogue and running, jumping with non-sense fight scenes.We all know about weird look of Tiger Shroff, but it was disappointing to know that this chap is really good Gymnast and he may win few Olympic medals for the country but his family is more interested to force him to choose Acting career.

And now about Actress, all I can say I may not recognize her if I see her in another movie because there is nothing for her but just to dance with hero and shed tears by using glycerin.My advice to you is that just watch video songs on the YouTube and you can skip the movie as there is nothing more entertaining than the songs. It's already available for free, no need to spend money.Please remember that Tiger Shroff can "Flip", Yes! he can actually "Flip", Oh God he "Filped Again", It's really Awesome that he can "flip", OMG how adorable he is flipping again.
