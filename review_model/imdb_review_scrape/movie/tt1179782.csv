" Fantabulous","A movie that showcases the coming of age of Indian cinema. We've had a lot of movies of late that signify a promising future (Dil Chahta Hai, Bheja Fry, Rang De Basanti), and this one carries forward the future of Bollywood. Directed beautifully by Rajat Kapoor (who was also involved with Bheja Fry), this movie is all you want a movie to be- Crisp storyline, brilliant acting, entertaining dialogues, and riveting as a whole. Ranvir Shorey revels in the lead role, very smoothly fitting into the roles of V.K. the actor and Raje the Don, and he gets even better when he's playing both the roles in the same body! He is truly a great actor, and if this is the direction Bollywood chooses to take, then he will be at the helm of it. Vinay Pathak as usual gives a dedicated performance, funny with the tinge of darkness. His buddy (dunno his name) is also fantastic, and his dialogue delivery and accent are hilarious. Neha Dhupia excels at looking hot. Naseeruddin Shah doesn't have much of a role, and in the later stages, his character was overshadowed (in the story itself, and in screen presence too) by Saurabh Shukla. The locales are wonderful. The background score is perfect for the movie. The absence of songs pleases you. All in all, an excellent experience, and the last line of the movie makes you realise, that its not just a dark comedy. Go watch it!" 
" A must watch because there are not many such in Hindi movies","I am a lazy person and generally don't like to put comments for movies. BUT, considering that I was about to give this movie a miss based on my friend's review and after watching it,I realized that probably I should convey the message to other like-minded people who appreciate different and intelligent cinema. This is a pretty good movie. I heard people say that the movie drags a bit in the later parts, I don't agree. It suits the tone of the movie at that time. It is very funny to begin with and ends nicely. I like those movies where you have something to think/talk about after having watched it. This is one such movie. Ranveer Shorey has given a brilliant performance. It must be watched because there are not many such movies in Hindi cinema. And I rate it above Bheja Fry which too I liked." 
" To Become Or Not To Become","While the many reviews I have read described 'Mithya' as a multi-layered thriller, I found it to be quite simple in terms of story but very layered. Due to the dark themes, it does fall on the lines of last year's 'Johnny Gaddaar', 'Manorama Six Feet Under' and 'Ek Chalis ki Last Local' in some ways but at the same time it's a completely different experience. 'Mithya' is indeed a terrific accomplishment by Kapoor and Shukla. While the screenplay may be a little imbalanced especially the comedy and the thriller it works very well for the film. It drags a bit at some sequences especially the first half. The ending while abrupt (and predictable) remains powerful and strangely the film then felt very short in length. On the technical front, while 'Mithya' is a dark film, the limited (and sometimes) poor use of lighting was a little irritating but the cinematography works.Now to the good stuff, I loved how Bollywood clich√©s have been used and taken a step further (unlike the so many Bollywood films where they just create more plot holes) leading to further twists and peeling off layers. Shukla and Kapoor did a fine job with the writing with the exception that some of the supporting characters could have done with more development. Sagar Desai's score is fantastic. I remember how much I loved his music in Rajat Kapoor's 'Mixed Doubles' and here he uses a completely different tune that is darker and less cheerful and does not disappoint one bit. I also liked how the dream/flashback and the 'search' sequences were shot. The film gives the similar feel of illusion as 'Manorama: Six Feet Under' but unlike 'Manorama' where it was quiet, warmly colourful and chaotic, here it is dark/cold-tinted, 'noisy' and chaotic. I liked the use of metaphors and symbols too e.g. the link between the most famous monologue in Shakespeare's 'Hamlet', 'To Be Or Not To Be', and the drowning corpse(s) (Ophelia).Here is one role that Ranvir Shorey has used to fully explore his acting. I cannot think of anyone else who could have done more justice to this multi-layered complex character as Shorey completely owned the part. It's perhaps a little too early to call it among the finest performances of the year but it's powerful nonetheless. Neha Dhupia oozes sex as she looks sizzling but her acting was mostly okay (nothing standout). Vinay Pathak and Saurabh Shukla are okay too (as the writing does not give them much scope). Iravati Mahadev makes the best of the little role she has which results in an impressive performance. Unfortunately, Naseeruddin Shah does not have much screen time but he makes the best of what he's given.In a nutshell, I would call it a brilliant film by Shukla and Kapoor. Critics seem to overly praise it just for being different rather than for being powerfully amusing (which it is). Okay, I'll rephrase that: It deserves to be praised for being a phenomenal film rather than for just being different. But I suppose that allows the viewer to discover for themselves what they're in for. In my opinion, this is the first great Indian film of the year. Yes, there are flaws but the impact of its viewing is undeniable (at least for me)." 
" 2008 has finally arrived for Hollywood","The movie is about the life of a struggling actor VK (Ranveer), who finds himself in the middle of a gang war just because of his looks. This movie has a lot of twists and it will be unfair on my part to give away those here. In one line, the film is story of a guy who finds himself at the wrong place in the wrong time and how that changes his life. Although the movie is not a remake of Don, but this is how a Don remake could have been.Rajat Kapoor and Saurabh Shukla have come up with a brilliant script, which is very unpredictable. Although I somehow knew the end, but the way movie reaches it's end is worth watching. The story has comedy, drama, action, romance, love, almost every element of a good script. Arindam Chaudhary has made up for his mistake (Rok Sako to Rok Lo) by producing this film. Rajat Kapoor has presented this brilliant script beautifully.If we talk about acting, everyone in the cast has played his part beautifully. Ranveer Shorey has performed really well in a very demanding role. Vinay Pathak leaves his mark in a small but significant role. Other actors Naseeruddin Shan, Saurabh Shukla, Iravati, Brijendra Kala, Harsh Chhaya all are good in their part and have been suitably cast. Neha Dhupia has proved that she can act, if she is given good roles. By the end of the year, this movie will definitely find it's name among one of the best movies of year 2008.I would rate this film as 8 out of 10 and would recommend every cinema lover to go and watch this film. I am sure you will be glad that you watched this film." 
" Bollywood's Best Of 2008","Finally, something decent emerges from the Bollywood stable this year. As always, Actor/Director Rajat Kapoor brings audiences a challenging film that tears through conventional Bollywood film-making norm, and once again comes out a triumph. After the...(read more) impressive two-punch of Mixed Doubles and Raghu Romeo, Rajat tries his hand at a gangster film with Mithya. Publicized as a comedy to lure audiences in, for the most part the film is actually a drama with elements of dark comedy. Without giving it away, let me just say that Mithya's story is akin to taking Shahrukh Khan's Om Prakash Makhija character and dumping him into the world of another Shahrukh starrer, Don, without the masala. Moreover, Mithya is a much better product than the former films, sorry Shahrukh Khan. With that being said, the film is a clever mix of dark comedy and traditional drama, with some brilliant performances complimenting a wonderful 'different' script. Ranvir Shorey is excellent as a man striving to figure out who he is, and where he belongs. He effectively portrays the range of emotions needed for his character. The rest of the cast support Shorey effectively. This is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think. See It!" 
" outstanding!!","it's been really long Bollywood have not been producing dark comedies or comic tragedies!! dunno how to put dis film into a genre! outstanding!! 10/10!! what a dilemma!! that too a natural one! this shows that cinema has a language of it's own! i' m strictly not here to postmortem the film! and definitely hat's off to Ranveer for an astonishingly versatile acting in the film. Rajat Kapoor has even made an actor like Neha Dhupia come out brilliantly! i would be patiently waiting for his next ventures! I am just a bit disappointed by the use of Vinay Pathak in the film! he could have been used better in the film. but then again watching it was an out and out pleasure!" 
" To be or not to be...","Mithya, a tragi-comedy , is film directed by Rajat kapoor. Rajat kapoor has really impressed in this movie though he didn't act in it..the story starts with showing how a simple man VK (ranvir shorey) tries his best to really make a mark for himself in the film industry. while attempting to really prove his mettle VK the simple man get caught into the web of murky underworld politics. He is cleverly manipulated by Nasserudin shah, Shaurabh shukla and their allies.the background music is wonderfully done. The film has dialogues from hamlet, which was intended for drawing parallel with a man who finally just becomes the pawn in the chess board. Mithya, is a wonderful and special because at certain instances the common man can relate to the characters of the film.there are times when one feels really bad for VK, who is to don the mantle of rajabhai the dreaded underworld mafia. The script is very crisp and fresh. there are comic relief and the film doesn't drag unneccesarily. Overall Mr.Rajat Kapoor has delivered a film that is worth watching." 
" Decent effort, Ranvir is awesome but the movie really drags","Coming from the team that made last year‚Äôs surprise hit Bheja Fry, many would have expected Mithya to be another laughter riot with a different edge. Maybe, the promos are to blame. But, this new offering from Rajat Kapoor, despite all its ills is nevertheless a decent effort in the realm of Hatke cinema, a genre which some call as the coming of age of Bollywood. Some call it a black comedy, but I‚Äôd call it experimental drama.VR (Shorey) a bollywood struggler inadvertently and unwillingly gets involved in an inter-gang rivalry due to his uncanny resemblance to a leading gangster. The opponents plot to kill the original and replace him with Shorey. Things turn against the protagonist when an accident causes amnesia and he starts to believe that he is the don he has been posing to be. The first half has a bit of comedy and the second has more pathos.The narrative of Mithya, its lack of songs, use of shades, dialogue style, gave it a strong feel of European cinema. The question pops up as to whether this was flicked outright from one, a la Bheja Fry being inspired from ‚ÄòThe Dinner Game‚Äô. I‚Äôd say, if you go for it expecting it to be a comedy, you‚Äôll dislike it. On the contrary, it could remind you a bit of RGV‚Äôs hey days of Satya and its likes. But it isn‚Äôt a total gangster story either.The only saving grace was the splendid performance by Ranvir Shorey which actually makes you feel for the character, mostly for its pitiful and at times funny situations. He is the movie‚Äôs only anchor. The Bheja Frier Vinay Pathak was nothing awesome this time. His sidekick Brijendra Kala was better. Naseeruddin Shah was wasted. Saurabh Shukla seems the same old goon we‚Äôve always seen. Neha Dhupia was okay.For all the praise that the movie has different layers, like the life of a Bollywood struggler, a gangster story, a bit of action, love and sympathy, I‚Äôd ask, what does it prove in the end? It just gives a feel that all was Mithya. Sometimes it makes me wonder whether the critics are just lauding different cinema just because it is ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô? The box office has the answers; the sparse audience in the movie hall yesterday said it all!" 
" A roller coaster fun ride film that has many good moments.","A roller coaster fun ride film that has many good moments.I liked it primarily for the treatment. It's a story that has some clues from yesteryear's DON but was treated completely differently and more realistically. Kudos to the director Rajat Kapoor for having the courage to put this up.Ranvir Shorey shows many facets of his acting capabilities here. He is simply brilliant and endearing. As the film moves, his character evolves and thus it grew on me. Of others, Naseeruddin Shah was at ease with his character. Saurabh Shukla plays his role effortlessly. A host of others gather to make this film a watch just for their acting. The best part of the film is the cast in itself. The cast that has tremendous acting abilities. The cinematography was good, if not great. What was shown was adequately done. The editing was superb. Considering this as 1 hour 50 minutes film, all the unnecessary things are chopped off. No uncalled for songs and no heroic fights. It's simply put and well compiled.The writing is terrific. With showing small cultural differences to major mindset exchanges, the film deals with many aspects without any hype and hoopla. The simplicity comes to the foray as a saving grace and it indeed is the big positive of this film.Thanks to writers Rajat Kapoor and Saurabh Shukla for having written it so exceptionally well. Also, thanks to producers for having the courage to bring it on screen. If not for anything, just watch it for Ranvir Shorey. A 4.5 for this brilliant film. http://braddugg.blogspot.in/" 
" Creative-Prof. Arindam Chaudhuri","Mithya is a movie produced by Prof. Arindam Chaudhuri and through his films he shows his creativity.I really like the way he presents his films.Mithya, a tragi-comedy , is film directed by Rajat kapoor.

" Just fabulous","It was an excellent movie, with great cast , who played their roles very well. The movie was very gripping and after watching the movie you will feel light hearted" 
" Rajat Kapoor at it's best!!!","In one word...Brilliant!!! Rajat Kapoor finally proved that bollywood has potential to come up with marvelous stories. Movie revolves around life of a guy who faces a lot of challenges which occurs due to unfortunate events. It shows close relationships with some other people who intentionally or unintentionally becomes part of this whole story. Movie can be considered as a dark comedy and drama which shows every aspect of life closely...emotions, love, fear, courage, deception...everything! Bollywood needs more of these kind of cinema to understand and feel emotions and life. Irony is we just ignore these films by tagging as 'Parellel cinema'. Way to go on Rajat...Incredible!!" 
" The dawn of the neo-crime genre","Don, done right.Directed by Rajat Kapoor, who played the smart part of things, make that, the extra-smart part of things, in the ripoff of 'Le diner des cons', 'Bheja Fry'.Casting his hero against type, he ensured that everyman, nee, every sidekick, Ranvir Shorey, headlined this one; with Naseeruddin Shah playing the heavy, with Vinay Pathak putting in one more of his powerful not-just-comedic performances, as the heavy for the heavy.Neha Dhupia, whose choice of roles such as this one, and her essaying the lead in 'Ek chalis ki last local', have endeared her to me, and not just a pin-up eye-candy, is fantastic as (more than just) the moll over here. In spite of most of its poignant plot- moves, that never quite stray into the predictable, staying more than a step ahead of its (Don-aware) audience, the abundance of dark humor in this one makes it one of the best repeat-watch noirs in movie history.As usual, vastly underrated and criminally un(der)seen, this one should (at least) become a cult classic, at the very least over here on UCMC.Buy the DVD a'ready." 
" Story So Fictitious Yet Real. ‚ô¶ 73%","Talking about the lives of gangsters in India, Mithya takes the story- line to a whole new level, where a two-bit actor played by Ranvir Shorey is sent to impersonate his look-alike gangster.The fun starts when the other gang teach the actor how to act and what to do once he gets inside the enemy clan's lair. Trouble ensues when he loses his memory after a fall. With some well-written characters, the plot follows the gang-rivalry and the towards the end, it turns out to be a heart-aching story which induces emotions and sympathy & anger.Rajat Kapoor is an okay director but I am amused by the characters and how this cast should be called the "Bollywood frat pack."BOTTOM LINE: A very different kinda movie, which don't get released much. Recommended!Violence/Gore: Critical | Sex/Mouth-Kiss: No | Vulgarity: Mild | Alcohol/Smoking/Drugs: Mediocre"
