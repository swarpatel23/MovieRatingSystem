" Same old story","I wasn't overly impressed with this movie as it had the same old story with some special effects that movies of this genre lacked.  The first half of the movie was interesting, but then it fell into the trap of a hasty plot. This movie seemed to be an amalgamation of "Shree 420", "Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman" and "Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani".  The performances of the actors were also fair.  I feel that nothing in this movie is worth remembering."
