" Mithunda rocks!!!!!","'Don Muthuswami' is a subject, which would've clicked all the way in the 80's and 90's, but in 2008 not sure. The film is a remake of the Stallone hit 'Oscar', but our real concern is that does the film entertain. To answer that simply - Mithun can never be doubted. The film is does entertain and the film is truly funny at times and the credit goes to 3-time National Award Winner. He is the life of the film and minus him the film would've fallen flat. 'Don Muthuswami' has some really funny moments and has a trump card: Mithun, but otherwise its a routine fare with a lot noise and action running throughout. To sum up, A fairly decent entertainer!Performances: As mentioned earlier, Mithun is the life of Don Muthuswami. Rohit Roy is terrific. Hrishita bhatt is alright. Mohit Raina is fare. Shakti Kapoor, Vishal Kotian, Rakesh Bedi and Dilip Joshi are funny in their roles. Others are adequate.on the whole 'Don Muthuswami' aka Sir Muthuswami is the only trump card the venture has to offer."
