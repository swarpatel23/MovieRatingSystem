" You Got Served meets Step Up","A bunch of mostly unknown Bollywood actors come together to remake two Hollywood hit movies (U Got Served and Step-Up) and for a change it was okay except for all the copied dance moves and copied songs (yes, they even remade The Pussycat Dolls & Timbaland's 'Wait a Minute'). It's not Kunal Khemu 'Superstar' good but it's a manageable melodrama in which the guys are a little bit too emotional and the girls a little bit too wooden. You will find yourself hitting the FAST FORWARD(no pun intended) button a bunch of times unless you're sucker for crappy scenes. The plot (for lack of a better word) follows two-down-on-their-luck best friends Rishi and Sunny(Akshay Kapoor) who roam the streets of Mumbai(India) dancing their days away since they don't have regular jobs. One day, they perform at a local shopping mall and catch the eye of an underground dance promoter who invites them to come and dance as his club. The boys accept but run into trouble when they reach the club and win the night's competition which does not sit with with the current reigning champs. A bitter rivalry between the two gangs ensues in which dangerous bets are made, lives are threatened and hearts are broken all in the quest to be the dance champions. All hell breaks loose when Rishi (who harbors a dark family secret) finds out that his best-friend Sunny has fallen in love with his baby sister Jeel (played by Tere Saang's Sheena Shahabadi) and has awoken the passion of forbidden dance within her as well. I give it 5/10 stars."
