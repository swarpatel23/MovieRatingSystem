" I will definitely not have Luv ka the end!","The first film by youth dept. of Yashraj film "yfilms" is in a way youthful.But the film is a half baked attempt at anti-romantic comedy.The film has a clear plot in the story. But again, it is not unique. It is an adaption from "John Tucker Must Die" but the film is never so fresh or so funny like the original.This is the directorial debut of the Roadies director "Bumpy". But sadly, he has not that spark to create an interesting movie as he did in the case of Roadies.Movie at times looks like some American weekly soap being telecast irrespective of its poor humor quotient and much needed style statement in a youth film.Shraddha Kapoor again fits into her shoes after Teen Patti.But yet she has a long way to go. Taha Shaah and rests are okay.Shehnaz Treasurywala is good.Editing is poor. Cinematography is okay.Not much to talk about these aspects.Music is good and peppy. Background score is okay.The Mutton song is unconventionally funny.If you like some High School Musical kind of series or some American daily soap trying to be cool or funny, you will love this. But overall the movie is strictly a one time watch for rom-com lovers and an avoidable stuff for the rest." 
" bad chick flick","This movie is about a vestal virgin who is so much in love with her boyfriend that she is ready to lose her virginity to him--but at the last moment ( before anything happens ) is brought to her senses by friends , who prove to her that to her boyfriend , she is just his latest conquest , and he has no plans to marry her .And all of a sudden , this shy girl turns into an avenging woman hell- bent on punishing the bad guy !!The plans to take revenge are corny and unrealistic, to say the least , including drugging the guy and making him dance an item number wearing ghagra choli !!Once the girl goes into revenge mode , the movie goes all hyper--too much happens too fast .Some women may like a girl taking revenge on a bang-bang-thank-you-ma'm type of guy .But at least I didn't like it......" 
" waiting for "THE END" ugh","i was so exited about this movie when I saw the casting song in trailers. But i dint know that my happiness will last just for 5 minutes. Such movies should be banned in between its making only. Firstly they copy the foreign stuff, then they add the Indian spices into it (which i am dead sure of that Indians are also are fed up of), then they add some disastrous and not at all required songs to add fuel to the fire. This movie was completely avoidable. its just because of summers that i needed an ac room to hang out with my friends so influenced by the casting song we went but that wish also left incomplete because the movie was too noisy and bubbly to digest. AVOID it completely. watching this movie is like your ex girlfriend sitting beside your ears for more than 2 hours,chewing strawberry bubble gums and shouting about the mistakes you did. Sadly you will conclude, none of them was bigger than WATCHING THIS CRAP." 
" Shrdada won best actress","She won best actress in just 2nd main movie...
Wow shrdada cute" 
" This film is about a trio of girls out for revenge on a guy that plays girls.","This is an epic movie! It revolves around the modern lives of urban teens and the ups and downs they face in the romantic aspect of their lives and this portrays the concept pretty excellently in my opinion. Shraddha Kapoor and Taaha Shaah were both fresh and talented actors who perfectly fit their roles. Although some might argue that the storyline is an unoriginal copy of John Tucker Must Die, this movie is actually nothing like the Hollywood movie. Yes, this movie also contains a trio of vengeful girls, but the similarities end there. And Hollywood contains a number of vengeful trios; Luv Ka The End is not a copy of every single one of those films. I think you should just sit back and enjoy this thrilling film and go along with the excitement. I find the theme of girl power the most coolest thing about Luv Ka The End. Seldom in Bollywood you see films that aren't male centric, and it sure feels good to watch something so fresh and female- centered. That is probably one of the top reasons why some people are so critical; this movie deviates from the norm, but it's a good thing. Watch it. :) You'll like it." 
" A fine bubbly teen movie but again its not an original.","The latest film from the house of Yash/Aditya Chopra under their new banner of Y-films has both positives and negatives associated with it. But as per their reputation, the banner does have its economics rightly placed which will surely enable them to get some descent returns from the movie despite of its few downers (if the film registers itself in the hip crowd).So, let us start from the positives associated with LUV KA THE END. Firstly the film is strictly made for the YOUTH specifically for the teenagers who have just started their college life. And may be, this is a start of a new trend in Bollywood where a project is made only for a particular age group and rest of the audiences are strictly not invited to the party very clearly. So if you are not in the age group of say 15- 21 or cannot feel that young anyway, then just consider as if the invitation card was not meant for you at all. Secondly, the film has a fresh young appeal and sticks to the point as per its genre in its first hour which sets the mood in. The viewer is exactly told what kind of film he is going to watch further and the script also doesn't deviate much from its basic plot till it ends. Thirdly and most importantly LKTE has a charming, lovable young girl Shraddha Kapoor leading the gang of girls superbly which remains the major highlight of the film unarguably. Sharaddha carries the whole film on her shoulders very confidently and impresses a lot. In fact I loved her in TEEN PATTI too and she does make the best of this great opportunity given by the Yash Raj Banner in LKTE.In the supporting cast, Taaha delivers an OK performance as the rich Casanova and all the gang members also perform their part well. Shenaz Treasurywala has only two scenes in the film and Archana Puransingh is not anything out of the routine. However Ali Zafar, once again proves that he has got the star material and charm to be a Solo Hero in his short cameo act towards the climax.The film basically revolves around a revenge plan made by Shraddha and her friends against a handsome rich brat of their college. The boy wishes to exploit her sexually and then is willing to use her video to be uploaded on a website which gives point to all boys for such rare footage. Luckily Sharaddha gets to know his intension before the D day and then decides to teach him a lesson in her own style.The first half of LKTE is fine with the right pace and sequences which keep you engaged. But the real downers occur post the intermission. In its second hour it becomes a bit slow with a completely unwanted item song 'Mutton' which doesn't make any sense and is quite annoying. Post interval the script lacks the fun element which returns only towards the climax making you feel a little less satisfied. There is one additional side tracks thrown in by the writers of a younger sister and Daadi, which seems to be totally out of place and could have been avoided.A film particularly made for the Hip generation needs to be equipped with some great energetic songs. But LKTE lacks in this department as I didn't find the songs too good other than the Ali Zafar's Track and 'Tonite' which is nicely composed and sung. The first time director Bumpy (whom you might recall seeing in the MTV ROADIES Behind The Scenes Episodes), gets the mood of his film perfect but he cannot be praised a lot since he keeps it too simple and also heavily borrows from the American Campus Comedies already hugely famous in our part of the world due to their porn-like subjects. Interestingly the director also makes a cameo in his film as the computer freak who actually tells the girls everything about the culprit website.But coming to the main downer of the film, it is not at all an original effort both from the writers and the director. The makers take bits and pieces from various foreign projects and then serve it to the audiences with their own original toppings decorated properly. The basic plot of the film is taken from JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE (2006) wherein three girl- friends together decide to teach their boy-friend a lesson. Now here I want to mention that apart from getting inspired from its basic theme, the makers of LKTE very childishly have also copied the TAG LINE of the English film too. As written in the posters of JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE the initial art works of LUV KA THE END also had the same Tag-Line reading "Don't Get Mad, Get Even" which is both strange and weird looking at the reputed banner of the project. Apart from this, the film also reminds you of MEAN GIRLS (2004) and the famous Net Telecast sequence seen in the 'AMERICAN PIE' series of films.But still, if you don't really care about its inspirational status and are really willing to see a Youthful Bollywood Campus movie, then chances are that you may like it in the end and have a good time in the theater along with your whole group. Hence do give it a chance if you are a game for such bubbly stuff." 
" Good attempt by Y banner","First of all, this movie is NOT a copy of John Tucker Must Die. Its title title and tag line may be similar, but the story isn't! Its about a girl taking revenge from her boyfriend who she realizes on her 18th birthday is (basically) a jerk.While in John Tucker Must Die, the 3 ex girlfriends plant a desirable girl for John Tucker and also plan pranks on him which work in his favor instead, in this movie, the guy IS her boyfriend but is only using her to get some points on this online billionaire boys club to win the King title, and her girlfriend Rhea, the main character realizes this on her birthday and with her 2 friends, decides to take revenge from him. Many teen movies have been made on revenge from ex boyfriends, you can't go about calling them copies, where this one has enough differences in its story to be not called a copy of JTND.Apart from this, the movie is well made! Its free of star-son cast and the new faces are fresh AND talented! The story is well written and the movie is well directed. It brings laughs at moments and you enjoy every bit of revenge she takes. Nothing seems lame, stupid or out of place.This movie was an attempt to create a teen oriented movie which is not the traditional love story ending in marriage and this movie does that successfully without trying to mock being Hollywood style.But at the end of they day, it is still a teen movie and many guys will only like it if they have it in them to bear a joke on their gender. Apart from that, a very well made movie indeed!" 
" Avoid this like a garbage and disease.Worst movie with awful and bad acting.","Really very bad and worst film.Guys please avoid this movie like a disease.The direction was one kind of worst.The screenplay was bad and very weak.The dialogues were bad.The songs were boring and gave me a headache.Really guys not a single thing in this movie was OK or you can say as good.And now comes to the acting blah blah blah what a terrible acting by shraddha kapoor.He can't act.The male lead was pathetic.So overall guys a very bad and atrocious film avoid this like garbage or like you avoid a disease.Don't waste you precious time on this third class garbage." 
" Fresh lessons to the teens","Its a complete teen package. With the new generation having relationships at early ages, its the best one to know to react.The title & promo of course lets you know that what you gonna see in the movie. But its amazing shot. I mean the director did a great job. Specially in the second half of the movie.Even though, there were very less twist-n-turns than expected. But they did a great job to keep up on your feet. One of the reasons for me to watch this one was Shraddha Kapoor, she is hot & cute at the same time.I would still say that it could have been better. These kinda movies would definitely bring down the depression rate of the teens who have been through such situations.Overall a good movie for anyone. A good go go from me...." 
" Luv Ka The End","Luv ka The End is a young anti-rom-com type movie focuses on the character Rhea, who is is the quintessential girl next door, in love with Luv Nanda, the richest, most popular boy in college. On the eve of her 18th birthday, they plan to take their relationship to the 'next level'.
