" Funny, Enjoyable Movie","I heard about this film but didn't pay much attention as the trailer itself wasn't interesting but one day i went to blockbuster videos and rented this movie as it was the only Hindi movie there that i hadn't seen. So after watching this movie i found out that i was wrong for judging it from trailer, this movie is way better than Fun2Shh and way more funnier! You've got to see this movie if u got time, it's a must see for comedy fans. The actress however may not be too interesting simply because she thinks she's all that but other than her the movie was a great laugh and not a waste of my time. So i would advise readers of this page to watch this movie." 
" A good comedy movie","There is not much publicity of this movie, and I too thinks its not a good movie and a cheap one, all star are news, everything is imperfect, but one day my friend force me to go and see this movie as there;s no other movie which we hadn't watch, When we go to theater, we wont believe what kind of movie this is, a superb comedy, All boys had done their best to make us laugh, everything which I and you guys do to impress a girl. All three boys Anuj, Vikas and Aslam want to marry a girl to make their career, and incidentally they all love Mehak only, but Mahek parents are South Indian and they want that Mehak should Marry Rahul, but all these 3 guys tries to impress Mahek. All songs are good. Three newcomers boys shows good act, as Mehak too. Rahul is a good actor he shows again, a good supporting cast too. This movie also gives us a talented young comic Actor, Anuj, who did few promising roles in movies like Funtoosh, Tom Dick and Harry,etc. Guys please don't miss this movie as its a reality related movie, and you guys gets few good tips how to impress a girl. I will give 9 out of 10" 
" Okay timepass","This movie was nothing special in itself.  Comedy is decent.  The cast wasn't really impressive.  Songs weren't bad.  This is basically an average movie that has nothing too great.  It's an okay movie if you just want to loosen up on a Friday evening or something."
