" Sit Back, Relax, and Enjoy this Hero's Tale in Typical No-Holds Barred, Silly, David Dhawan Style Fun","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsMain Tera Hero" is a typical madcap David Dhawan comedy, with all the silly fun, rambunctious pacing, over-the-top characters, and zany music that we've come to lover over the years. While it's by no means among his best work, it certainly tells a routine story in an extremely humorous and exuberating manner. Let's just call it for what it is - old formulaic David Dhawan wine smartly packaged by the veteran Director in a new bottle via a contemporary look and the re-invention of his staple comedy hero in an entertainingly modern avatar.We get all the typical jokes and gags Dhawan is so well known for; some old and revamped, some new and refreshing, some surprisingly brilliant brilliant, some beyond ludicrous, but all highly entertaining and rib- ticklingly funny. Most of all, we get the quintessential Dhawan hero, neatly packaged and reconditioned in a zesty persona that once again resonates fondly with audiences like the days of yore.Varun Dhawan displays his histrionics to the hilt and proves to us that he was born to be a true-blue Bollywood hero. He has all the makings of a being a decent actor with strong star-power at the box-office. As to how well his acting skills improve, that's left to be seen, but suffice to say the initial signs are good. Ileana D'Cruz and Nargis Fakhri are present for eye-candy, and Dhawan portrays the oomph quotient to maximum effect, especially in the case of Ms. Fakhri. Arunoday Singh's plays the bullying buffoon act passes muster. The rest of the cast is made up of veterans such as Anupam Kher, Saurabh Shukla, and Rajpal Yadav, and they're all in fine form.The plot like in most Dhawan films has a simple humorous premise, constructed together by a series of gags, witty one-liners, slapstick events, and hilariously silly dialogues. What's really invigorating for all Dhawan fans is that the Director seems to have regained his mojo, which had temporarily evaded him after a few cringingly bad comedies and unnecessary remakes since "Partner" - his last good effort. As mentioned earlier, this film will certainly not be counted among his best in coming years, but he's at least back in form. Also, for a film of this ilk, it boasts of surprisingly good technical values, particularly in the editing and cinematography departments."Main Tera Hero" doesn't shamelessly ask you to leave your brain at home in the name of entertainment; that's just plain inane and signals a movie's complete absence of merit from the onset itself. Instead, it gives you an opportunity to relax your brain and enjoy two hours of unadulterated, madcap, fan in David Dhawan's archetypal style." 
" The Positives & Negatives. ♦ 61%","While I am awestruck with Varun Dhawan's performance and dialog delivery, I am not happy with the plot because it is too illogical and defies reality.David Dhawana has always managed to make us laugh and with Partner, he had reached zenith. With Main Tera Hero, he collaborates with his son and long-time associate Saurabh Shukla to give out a funny take on crime & romance. While I could relate it to 2005's Welcome, I should agree I was never bored in the first half. It talks about the story of a mischievous boy who travels to Bangalore to get a degree but instead falls in love with a girl. The plot maneuvers to a villain and then to a twist.Come second half, the fun quotient declines as the plot gets more melodramatic & repetitive. The story also takes damage because the story is seemingly absurd. This drama sequences do not happen in real life nor do they happen in dreams. Only writers can make this up and that is what such genres of films are known for, I agree. hence, a humble 6/10 and it is not the film I am rating, but the genre.Narghis Fakhri can't act while she's definitely got the hots; Ileana D'Souza is fine, too. Arunoday Singh is good enough. Anupam Kher does a good part and overall, good cast. But the limelight is stolen by Junior Dhawan and I laud his second stint since SOTY. Good job!BOTTOM LINE: Enjoyable and is one of the few watchable movies released this year." 
" A Colorful Nonsense","In the 90's David Dhawan and Govind teamed up together to entertain us with the best of bollywood madcap comedies. These movies had the same logic as the Tom and Jerry cartoon shows, u wanna watch u better give your brain a rest-the movies were entertaining and provided a good laugh as long as you ignored the fact that what was happening on the screen was just non stop nonsense, but what the hell, you were being entertained and you were not being bored and you are stress free.Years later today, David Dhawan brings his son Varun Dhawan with a similar mad cap comedy which catapulted Govinda to stardom. You have the same jarring colors, the same brainless heroines and a villain who is never to be taken too seriously and above all MEIN TERA HERO has good music, the tapori kind which Govinda excelled at dancing to.Seenu (Varun Dhawan) is an older version of Dennis the menace and when he is rejected in marriage by an obese girl because he is not a graduate, he embarks on journey from Ooty to Banglore to get a Degree.On the way he bashes some goons who try to eve tease some girls and establishes himself as a hero material and not just a comedian.He joins a college and woos Sunaina (Ileana De Cruz-with bad makeup) who is in fact being stalked by a police officer Angad (Arunodhay Singh), who bashes any guy who even talks to his girl.Seenu outwits Angad and takes off with Sunaina, only to witness her being kidnapped. Angad informs him that the kidnapper is Vikrant (Anupam Kher) an international Don located in Bangkok. Vikrant's Daughter Ayesha (Nargis Fukhrey-with bad acting skills) is in love with Seenu and so her father had Sunaina kidnapped to blackmail Seenu to marry Ayesha.The movie then heads for a roller coaster ride with laughs galore including a rather funny shiv bajan tuned to the music of badtameez dil.Varun Dhawan is confident and carries himself well and you can see sparks of Govinda in him in most of the scenes.Arunodhay Singh is funny with a poker face and gives a good performance, especially the anger management scene is one of his best in the movie.Ileana De Cruz would take the award for the worst makeup of the year. The girl was good in Barfi, but gives a kind of kindergarten school kid stage show performance.Nargis Fukhrey with the weird accent tries hard to perform, but drops her act midway and joins Ileana as why the hell do I have to act, when I can expose attitude.Anupam Kher is the highlight of the movie, the don who says the word in his every sentence thrice because he was from a "Pahadi Ilaaka".Music by Sajid-Wajid replicates the Anu Malik style of music, the songs are fresh, foot tapping and energetic. The PALAT song says it all.Kudos to David Dhawan for bringing the colorful comedies of yore back.If you love tom and jerry, you would love this movie too-please do not forget to leave your brain behind when you set off to watch this." 
" Good attempt!","Main Tera Hero (MTH) is a glittering vehicle for star son Varun Dhawan to drive, which he does with practiced panache. However, even more than Junior, MTH has his dad David Dhawan stamped all over it. The plot is familiar Dhawan territory - one boy, two babes, a mansion and many clowns - but with new landmarks, from plunging bikinis to lip-glossed kisses, thrown in. Those seeking movies with meaning, note - Main Tera Hero is a pav bhaji picture, quick, spicy, hot. It has the depth of a comic strip but it also has its neon-shaded fun. For those who want a light laugh, here's your boy. On the whole, MAIN TERA HERO is a wild, wacky, madcap entertainer that has the unmistakable stamp of the master of entertainers -- David Dhawan. An over the top plot, humor quotient and performances are three aces the film stands on. The film should work well with admirers of typical Bollywood masalathons, also because Varun Dhawan pulls off the act with flamboyance and bowls you over with an uproarious act in this zany entertainer. Go, have fun and laugh out loud!" 
" nice movie with lots of romance and fun","An excellent performance by Varun Dhawan and Ileana D'Cruz but a below average performance by Nargis Fakhri.This will make you laugh all the time during movie but having a average plot.I thought it was a predictable love story weaved around Varun Dhawan, Ileana D'Cruz and Nargis Fakhri. Before interval, Varun, Ileana and Arunoday's love triangle is in focus, while I wonder when Nargis will walk into the scene. When she does appear towards the interval, we are left wanting for more. The full-on David Dhawan affair starts in the second half, when Varun Dhawan romances both Nargis and Ileana simultaneously.all though having a lot of twist its a nice experience and full on fun and more just a Paisa Vasul movie." 
" Entertainment in David Dhawan Style","MAIN TERA HERO - We all know what type of movies David Dhawan make,,,,there has been an era of David Dhawan,,,,,,when he and Govinda and sometimes Anil Kapoor and Salmaan khan makes us rolling down our seats laughing........Shola Aur Shabnam , Aankhen , Biwi Number 1 , Judwa , Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Partner has been my favorite .....Up to partner it has been OK ..... But after that his last three movies,,,,Do not Disturb , Rascal and Chasme Baddor are too bad.........But with Main Tera Hero he came back,,,,but only to some extent..... The era when David Dhawan was a successful director was different,,,,i was a child,,,,and i don't care much about the story line or intelligence of movie,,,,i only use to laugh to the one liner jokes and overacting by Govinda (Govinda was the only actor in Bollywood who looks good while doing overacting)...... But now the time has changed,,,,as for my self i need some intelligence in the movie along with entertainment.....Its not good to just take a silly story ,, create a confusing situation (by confusing i means the characters in the movie are confuse,,,,and audience is the person who actually knows everything) and insert good jokes in between them.....In such case what happens that while u r watching the movie u will enjoy it when jokes are cracked,,,and to some extent the movie looks a Paisa Wasool,,,,but u r not satisfied with it..... Personally m not the audience who like much of the nonsense comedy movie,,,,but Main Tera Hero is not a total non sense movie,,,,still there are parts where u will think that the movie is trying too hard to make u laugh...... There are a lot of resemblance of Govinda and Salmaan khan will watching Varun Dhawan.....And i think David Dhawan has got his Govinda part 2 .... I will not be shocked if there will be a movie again in quick time made by David starring Varun.....And why not,,,,its an enjoyable combination ,, but i just request David sir to concentrate more on the story and not just showing his son's talent in the screen...... Varun Dhawan has his own attitude,,,,he does everything with attitude,,he dance , he fight , he speaks , he even runs in attitude,,,,and many times it looks like he is doing a lot of show off ,,,, let me give u an example,,,,,in student of the year in between every song there has been some parts where Varun dance alone to show how good he can dance,,,,,,,the same thing happened in this movie,,,,he over expose his dancing qualities in songs,,,,which only adds to the length of the song and also give wrong impression,,,,somebody should tell him,,,,if u have talent don't showoff,,,,it will come out automatically......In spite of all those show off,,,,Varun has acted well,,,almost like Govinda of 90s ,, and let me tale u to copy Govinda style of acting is not a easy work..... Illiana has acted well,,,,she has done more than 2 dozen of Masala movies in south ,, so to act in this movie was a cake walk for her....Nargis is a bad actress,,,,or u can say she doesn't at all belongs to Masala genre,,,,i remember in an interview David Dhawan has said that he has taken Nargis because she is beautiful and his Hindi accent is bad,,which is needed in the movie,,,,i guess David has forgot that to act good is the most important thing for a movie......Anupam Kher and Rajpal Yadav are enjoyable ,,,,, but i enjoyed Shaurav Shukla's character more,,,,i appreciate that director has used him sufficiently.....Arunoday is a very good actor,,,,but his character is so badly scatched,,,,in first half he is a angry cop who is taking anger management classed,,,,who uses more of his punch than his mouth,,,,but in second half suddenly there has been a drastic change in his character ,, he become a foolish and everyone is making fool of him,,,nobody is scared of him....He should choose better characters for himself.... Full marks for David Dhawan,,,,only he could have given such an entertaining (if only partial) movie out of such a thin plot..... Music was catchy,,,,although some song a misplaced but are visually good so are enjoyable..... Editing is great,,,,as the movie is just 2 hr and 8 min long. Movies like Main Tera Hero are needed in Bollywood in regular intervals,,,,there is a big part of audience which enjoys such movies....Small mention of Salmaan who have given the voice of god in the movie,,,,he was enjoyable too.... M going for 3 out of 5 as i partially enjoyed it and my money is not wasted,,,,u can enjoy it less or more depends on the thing that in which category of audience u fall.... by ANuP APu KuMaR" 
" A Meaningless Plot Involving Goofy Characters.","Main Tera Hero is not at all up to the mark. The movie is another typical Bollywood Rom-com which fails to entertain. It is blessed with only a little number of sequences which possess good humor. Besides this, it just disappoints you. The story tells us about a flamboyant youngster who travels to Bangalore to achieve a degree but instead finds the love of his life before a heap of illogical chaos unleash. Performances are mediocre and some episodes exhibited are awfully bizarre. The actors in performance are neither highly impressive nor depressing. Varun Dhawan, in his second film was seemingly fair to middling. Opposite him was the lovely Ileana D'Cruz who doubtlessly managed to make a hit. Nargis Fakhri, who was another integral part of the story line was absolutely unsatisfying. Supporting roles enacted by Arunoday Singh, Rajpal Yadav and Saurabh Shukla were garden-variety. Anupam Kher in a minor role was strictly ordinary. David Dhawan has been successfully managing to provide us with films containing genuine comicality, but over the years, his flicks are getting worse. It was Chashme Baddoor last year, and this year, it is Main Tera Hero. Screenplay was simply absurd. Editing and Cinematography departments have probably managed to hit the spot. Music by Sandeep Shirodkar was slightly above average.In short, the movie is silly and nonsensical. It might have worked out for me if the makers would have chosen to enhance the plot equipping it with some sort of basis. Watch it only if you are in love with typical Bollywood entertainers. Elseways, avoid it." 
" Not awesome but not awful too!!","First half of the film goes at mindless speed with illogical comedy which makes you think what's going on but second half gives a relief and makes you feel better to watch it till end.The story revolves around Sheenu (Varun Dhawan) the notorious student in Ooty, India and a drop out from his college. In order to pursue his education he takes admission in another college in Bangalore city, India. Here he falls in love with Sunaina (Ileana D' Cruz) who is also studying in same college. But Sunaina is forced to marry Angad (Arunoday Singh), a local policeman. On the other hand, Sheenu has another die-hard lover in form of Ayesha (Nargis Fakhri) whom he saved from goons by bashing them up in a train from Ooty to Bangalore. Ayesha's father a gangster (Anupam Kher) kidnaps Sunaina to get hold of Sheenu for his daughter. Now how Sheenu gets screwed up in this love triangle and how he strikes back, this quiz with twists and turns holds you throughout the 128 minutes runtime.The director keeps balance in both action & comedy. Lead actor Varun dhawan gives his best to keep viewers laughing with two hot girls Ileana D' Cruz & Nargis Fakhri to steam up & adds some oomph on the show. Music by Sajid-Wajid is brilliant. Most of his foot-tapping tracks like 'Saari night Besharmi ki height' and 'Palat' are excellent as well as beautifully choreographed.All in all I would rate first half 4/10 and second half 6/10 which makes my rating 5/10." 
" Not worth your time","I do not know why did I go and see this movie. Its not so entertaining, expected to be meaning less and non-logical like many Indian comedies but still this manages to be worse than that. I regret watching it.Movie starts with Varun failing in school to join top college in Bangalore and falls for a girl and then it is the story how the other actress comes into picture and is desperate to marry him. As usual love wins. blah...blah...blahThe movie has very few good moments to enjoy.At some point it was kind of boring to watch the two hot actresses. Sourabh Shukla as usual very good to watch with whistle though a short role. Anupam Kher as per the role always does a good job. Shakti Kapoor being the trade mark of Davin Dhawan Raja Babu movies was there for no reason.Overall a must miss movie." 
" one of the worst movie without story and mind","David Dhawan made this movie for his son and I think it is only for his son not for audience. David worked with Govinda a lot not in this movie he tried to do the same with his son. like Govinda's movies you must leave your brain at home before you are going to watch Main Tera Hero.Story is noting. Varun has done overacting which is useless. Ileana looking great. Nargis Fakhri's role was not up to mark and it was not her fault. director's main motive was to keep camera on his son and he did the same. Arunodaya Singh is not for comedy his body and acting is for serious role. in spite of her small roll Evelyn Sharma looked gorgeous. when you look this movie, it will remind you many Govinda's movies.if you are going for time pass only then I suggest you must try something else like Pizza or burger. it will save money and time with much more enjoyment." 
" Was this a April Fool's joke ? Cause I didn't like it... AT ALL","watched MAIN TERA HERO ...does having money(a lot of money) is enough to make you a director/film-maker? in Bollywood unfortunately..YES...this "film" is yet another example of the sh!t produced by these "film- makers" on the name of FILM SO its has a lousy team of the lead actors..which can't act AT ALL except for the Anupam n few a others(BUT the poor script ruined their talent too)..both of the "actresses" can't even speak normally(so forget about their acting)..Varun Dhawan looks nice n puts all his effort still fails to impress(again script has to blame)...their characters defies their own nature(in film) in every 5 minutes esp the supposedly "villains "(even cartoon characters remain in their characters for more than that)...THOUGH its plot does not have a loophole CAUSE its made up in a loophole itself... FILM's "direction" is so poor that it shouldn't be called direction...YES a few(FEW) scenes can make you smile for a while..BUT they're not enough for compensating 2+hours of your life you'd just waste on this bullsh!t filled with bullsh!t/useless songs & I can just go on n on about this made by rich crap..so I'll just finish with _DO NOT WATCH_this crap msg" 
" I for one...Liked it","To be honest ..I for on really enjoyed the movie..Maybe it was because i went in with low expectations after reading all the mixed reviews.. ? Not sure.But really, other than the long dancing numbers which i found to be really time consuming,I really enjoyed the story line,the acting and the characters.You would honestly find me laughing most of the time..(if i wasn't forwarding the songs that is).I loved every character in the movie especially 'Angad' and 'Peter'...they were really hilarious.Overall,Great Rom-com for a fun evening :)"

" Don't believe any review that says it's a good movie","It's absolutely garbage, unfunny , non sense and filled with overacting of Varun Dhawan" 
" Very Entertaining!!!","I had mixed feeling about this when going to the theater but I was glad after watching this. The movie is funny and i mean not forced funny but actually witty funny, even though the movie is centered around the main actor Varun. everyone produces the performance required for the movie to be successful especially rajpal yadav and anupam kher were fantastic.The actresses look really hot, the songs are catchy ,the actions are both outrageous and entertaining, the dialogues are original and funny and the plot has an important twist , and it never gets boring, so trust me you will certainly laugh out loud, a David dhawan special" 
" Make believe return of the tapori hero","The 90's were all about stereotypes, and Govinda owned this nice little niche- madcap comic, singing, dancing, and mostly family friendly entertainer, playing to the masses. Think Coolie No.1, Saajan Chale Sasural, Hero No.1, and Haseena Maan Jayegi. Helping him create and cement this unique position was David Dhawan, in over 17 movies. And this combination reigned supreme till their creativity dimmed, and other mainstream actors such as Akshay and Salman and directors such as Priyadarshan started experimenting, with results that far superseded Govinda-Dhawan combos. Audience adulation is notoriously fickle, but today in Bollywood with major stars either playing the action-comedy combination or retaining the strong and silent stereotype, room for the fun and friendly entertainer seems to have opened up again. Daddy Dhawan thinks his son Varun Dhawan fits the bill to a T, and so we have Main Tera Hero. Dhawan plays Seenu, with a penchant for infamy, and with a hot-line with the gods. When he is kicked out of his town, lands in Bangalore and promptly falls in love with Sunayana who everybody is afraid of, since she is the unrequited love of local police goon Angad. This is fairly simplistic so far, so to make it a love triangle, comes in Ayesha, daughter of criminal Vikrant Singhal, who is besotten with Seenu. The rest of the film is vintage David Dhawan fare, with Seenu romancing two girls while trying to extricate himself from the mess.Like what most director fathers do for their sons, the movie is an unabashed attempt to showcase Varun Dhawan's talents. As the fast talking, naughty Seenu, he is quite spontaneous, and along with Ileana d'Cruz and Nargis Fakhri, they make a glamorous threesome. But he perhaps tries too hard to channelize Salman and Govinda, and as a result, the movie is genuinely funny only in parts, forcefully funny in most. The girls are no Karishma Kapoor, do nothing more than adding oomph. Rajpal Yadav reprises countless Johnny Lever acts from the past, and Anupam Kher does what he can actually do with his eyes closed- funny gangster, loving father. Arunoday Singh is perhaps the only guy trying to break stereotypes here, and is the surprise act. There is a cameo by cult favorite Shakti Kapoor, pity though that it is so short.So does Main Tera Hero warrant a watch? Yes and no. It is a slapstick, retro 90s style partly comedy with added Western influence. While many among us have outgrown this form of entertainment, I would think it is a one time watch on a rainy day at most. In the recent past there has been others such as Shahid Kapoor, and Ranbir Kapoor who have tried to don the tapori act but failed. Is Varun Dhawan then the new messiah? Yes and no again. He has potential, but is not quite the finished product yet. Given a few more years of experience and a good script, he might be able to establish himself in this niche."
