" More interesting than Dhoom 2","This film is such a joy for Hindi cinema goers and non Hindi cinema goers alike.The songs are fantastic, they really move the story along and occur at just the right time to heighten the emotion. AB to forever is so catchy the audience clapped along! It is not a film for men who are expecting The fast and the Furious, it is a film, for softies - a great and genuinely lovable cast of characters portrayed with dignity and truth by top actors as they face the trials of life - with courage and a smile, according to the tag line. And they really do.Rani and Saif are a believable and appealing couple, one hopes they will be paired again on screen, the children are adorable. Rani drunk is HI-Larious and Saif is such a thoughtful and witty actor. They both look at their most beautiful in this film. The family unit is totally compelling.Ta Ra Rum Pum stays true to its Indian heart whilst embracing Western cultures and ideas without envy. A very enjoyable well made film" 
" good entertainer","i don't know why people hate this movie.im totally surprised.it was a well made movie.the values and the way life has to be lived have been clearly depicted in the movie.there may be a few flaws but the positive points overshadows the negatives.if we come to the performances except for the small boy everyone does wonderful acting.some scenes were so good that even you the viewer will feel the pain of the character.saif has done a wonderful job and so is rani.next to this coming to the music of the film, the film had many lovely melodies and very good situational track.overall the film as a whole is a very good package.my advice would be that never keep your expectations high for any movie.if you do so, if the movie is very good it will look OK and if the movie is good it will look worst.at the end of the day it is your expectation that rules and not the actual content of the movie." 
" A nice movie that could have been better...","It has been almost 4 weeks since release of Namstay London and there had been no other major release recently. So, being movie aficionados we were quiet looking forward to this fast track racing action.It is difficult to describe this film in a regular way. As we say in India; it is just too "Filmy"! It has all regular ingredients of a successful movie - a happy family (with dog), a tragedy, the downfall and then back to success amongst tears and a kid in hospital... It can't get more FILMY than this...Having said that, I must say that it is an entertaining movie with some nice locations, rocking music, meaningful lyrics and decent acting from Saif & Rani. Saif doesn't quite reach the heights in terms of performances he gave in Omkara or Parineeta, but still he is looking good as family man.This movie won't surprise you at all, in fact it has all tried and tested bollywood masala (right down to the Indian flags in the final winning sequence). I generally do not prefer to write long previews as readers (including me) find them boring. In short, don't watch this movie for some extraordinary movie experience, but watch it if you want some decent fun with family & kids." 
" Movie about life","Tara Ram Pam is a fantastic movie about Life.This is the movie about a small time tyre changer and cabbie Rajveer Singh who is very ambitious and wants to make it big. Once he gives lift to Javed Jaffery who got some urgent work and wants to reach the place very fast. Saif drive impresses Javed and he helps him become a Race Car driver. He meets Radhika who has been known as very Kanjoos whereas Saif is very spendthrift. Rani thinks about tomorrow whereas Saif lives for today. Radhika marries Rajveer against her father's wish and starts living with him. Over the years they have two sweet children's, Champ and Princess and Rajveer becomes one of the top ranking racer in US. But one race accident shattered his dreams. He becomes handicapped mentally. He is unable to race again because of the mental block he develops after the accident. He lost his home and everything else. But Radhika hasn't lost her hope in him. She knows that their day will come soon. They move to a small house.The most touching part is when they tell their children that they are going to play a reality show where they would live like a poor with just $2000 in their hand. He starts lying to make money. Fate brings him back to race track when his son is admitted in hospital and needed $65000 to be saved. Will he win the race again ? Will he be able to save his son ?" 
" Awesome movie","It was an awesome fun movie that we don't get much in our Indian film industry as the top directors like Karan Johar are making only emotional movies. I liked everything about this movie, and the music was superb. Also the actors played a very great role which includes Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Javed Jaffrey, and all the people who were part of the movie. And it surely matches up to its tag line: Don't worry be happy. Its a very good lesson for people especially Indian people as they get very tensed out really fast and look at the negative side of their lives. This movie teaches us how to tackle these everyday and real-life situations. And behind all that to always be happy as we never know if we will be alive the next day. The overall mood of the movie was not tragic at all, and that's what I liked especially about it. SRK is my favorite actor but he nowadays only appears in emotional movies so he should also appear in these kinds of movies, and I am telling you I seriously hate tragic movies. Because, you know in India people watch those Ekta Kapoor's daily soaps which has nothing but mostly tragedy. I say if TV serials and movies are all going to be tragic then there will be no fun. Hats off to this movie and I hope bollywood produces more of these kinds of movies so that watching movie can be fun again." 
" Tara Ra "Hum Tum" Rum Rum","Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjee had a magnificent chemistry in Hum Tum. This one is just an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the magic of their previous collaboration. But this film is awfully uninspiring and the story of a family who goes bankrupt is annoyingly repetitive. Here the light romance turns into a cheesy melodrama and the director seems to be confused enough to not know what to do. There are of course touching moments, and the songs are good, but the portrayal of a family in times of trouble is terribly handled and is full of regular age-old clich√©s. Saif and Rani do their best but can't save the flawed script. The dialogues are cheap and overly emotional, and the reality nonsense is pathetic. All in all Siddharth Anand did not recreate Salaam Namaste, and Saif-Rani did not recreate Hum Tum." 
" Watch it for Rani","And even so it may not be worth it. A "Rags to Riches, back, and back again" story that leaves much to be desired. And surprisingly the weak link is Saif Ali Khan - he sleep walks and grimaces through the role of RV, the cabbie turned NASCAR superstar who cannot hold on to his money. His kids are called Princess and Champ and there is even a cute dog. Rani is his wife who keeps the family on a steady path and always believes in her man. She was very cute early on as she fell in love with the cabbie, and she was very good later on as the burdened woman - the only reason to see the film. The songs were mediocre, the racing scenes were well done except for Saif flashing his teeth as though he was in some comedy routine. There were supposedly heartbreaking moments, but you felt not much as it was all so formulaic and often verged on caricature. There was not much of a story, and it is no wonder the film did poorly. New York landscapes and the Manhattan skyline, a new sport to focus on - these do not work without a decent plot.So watch it if you are a die hard Rani fan - otherwise avoid." 
" Needless, senseless, idiotic","I so wish I had read some of these comments before buying the movie. The first third of the movie was quite OK to watch, but then, for the rest, I felt like the makers of the movie and everybody who accepted to play in it were making fun of the spectators. Almost everything was nonsense, from the plot, to the New York settings. I love Bollywood movies, I love Saif and Rani, I could watch some Bollywoods over and over again, and I have seen a lot of them, but this is a movie that should never have been made. It made me very mad, because the plot was bad (but i could have survived that, not all movies can be good), but mainly because it was SUCH nonsense. Did the makers actually think that we would believe what they were showing us? That in car races, competitors can try to kill or actually kill each other openly without being punished? That in New York, blacks are the bad guys? (come on!) That in a poor part of new York, people are actually all mean? That after being a super racer for years, earning certainly quite a lot of money, Saif has still not paid up the house he and his family live in? That every single object they own is actually not theirs, because they purchased on loan only and never repaid it (from paintings to their flatware) ? I wonder what he did with the money he earned?Believe me, don't waist your time, your money nor your nerves, it definitively is not worth it." 
" What were they thinking?","As a viewer, I am generally forgiving of all movies. I am one of those guys who sees some positives in movies I abhor, if only to make myself feel good about having wasted my money. I am still looking for some justification to Ta Ra Rum Pum. Lifted almost directly from the Will Ferrel starrer 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby', Tara Rum Pum makes its first mistake there. How can you lift a movie the purpose of which was to promote America's premiere slapstick/schtick/whacky comedian today, and make it into a Yash Raj cry-fest, complete with song-dance, love, feel-good, saccharine sweet - (I don't even want to call it a film anymore, because I don't think Yash Raj make films. They make garbage). The hero is RV, Who has been the top driver in the NASCAR and he has an accident and loses confidence to drive fast again. So, he loses everything, as he has bought everything on instalments!!!To the writer, director and production house - THIS IS THE WESTERN WORLD, IT IS AN ECONOMY RUN ON CREDIT. YOU DO NOT GET CREDIT BEYOND YOUR MEANS. IF YOU HAVE BEEN A TOP NASCAR DRIVER FOR EIGHT YEARS, YOU ARE NOW WORTH AT LEAST 50 MILLION DOLLARS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE YOUR LITTLE HOUSE, AND SPORTS CAR IF YOU GET FIRED WHEN YOU ARE IN THE POSITION THAT RV IS IN. To say that a man worth millions of dollars is on the road, because he still has not paid off his house mortgage, a house that cannot be worth more than a million or two anyway is plain stupid. The message of the movie is - 'do not hire-purchase' - good message, but at least show it properly.The premise of the movie is so irritating, that even the good bits of the movie hold no importance. Jaaved Jaafrey is great as the friend, and the kids, especially the daughter are good too. Saif Ali Khan goes through the motions, and Rani Mukherji is now officially stale. The music is good, but then hey, buy the CD. To the makers, If you wanna copy something, the next time, please copy something worth copying." 
" Whatever will be, will be!","That's one of the messages embedded in this very glossy yet hard hitting Dramedy from the Yash Raj camp, it's their first release of the year and not a bad one might I add. Siddharth Anand (clearly still very hungover Salaam Namaste) hits it and drives one home for the winning team with his plucky characters, plummy roles and eye-catching cinematography. At first, I have to say I was quite alarmed at the pace of the movie and not to mention the annoying gimmicks because it was almost like either the writers or the director himself was nervous at his sophomoric attempt. They seemed to be trying everything to make sure they kept the audience's attention but thankfully they realise the meaty story they have to tell which allows them to ease up later. The "Meet Cute" between the two main characters almost seemed forced but thankfully Rani Mukherji(who plays Radhika, nicknamed Shona by her lover later on in the film) does damage control with her effortless ability to not only emote but create a comfort zone for her co-stars(who might I say realise earlier on that they all should be following her lead which they do throughout the entire film). Saif Ali Khan plays her love interest Ranvir(who is nicknamed RV by a well-meaning friend earlier on in the film). The film is narrated from start until half-way through by Priya(nicknamed Princess by her parents she's daughter to RV & Radhika and they also have a son named Champ and a dog named Bruno), so those who hate children in Hindi films should be prepared because the kids have very pivotal supporting roles. RV, a tire-changer at the New York Raceway(let me just say that I didn't think NY had a raceway until I got home and checked and found one in Riverhead, NY but that's miles away from NYC where RV lives and oh never-mind...) when he receives the opportunity of a lifetime to become a race-car driver, which he does and excels. Before this time, he meets Radhika; a beautiful piano playing Indo-NewYorker socialite whose Ipod he breaks after sharing a cab with her and the sparks fly. A chanced meeting throws them together again and Radhika demands that he pays her $50 to replace her broken Mp3 player(which I must interject that the cheapest Ipod "the shuffle" costs $100 and hers looked like a Nano but whatever...) RV, pressed for time invites her to the raceway and tells her he will give her the money if he wins the race and Radhika in turn becomes his loudest cheerleader there (I loved that scene by the way, especially when she started playing the drums. I'm a Tabla girl myself so you know that totally rocked seeing that). Naturally, he wins the race and wins Radhika's heart through a series of loves songs including the very sentimental 'Hey Shona' (Shona is Bengali for Sweet), they marry(and yes their white wedding is truly a must see LOL!) and start living the good life. Sounds like a fairytale doesn't it? Princess actually asks this question during her narration and it couldn't have been more poignant. All is not as it seems on the outside. Radhika has hidden the fact that her father disapproves of her husband and his lifestyle, a warning that will come back to haunt her later on during the film. The fast life soon catches up with RV in a series of catastrophic events that not only affect him but his entire family and their financial security. This ultimately tests the limits of love, trust and endurance the couple have for one another. Look for strong performances by Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjee(especially Rani, who should add another feather to her hat with her standout performance in the film).The Highs include: 1. The Indian Crodile Dundee dude from Salaam Namaste cleans up and plays RV's best friend. And he scores big time because he's still just as hilarious.2. the tribute to the cast of RENT with Ab To Forever which is arguably the best song in the entire film thanks to a borrow from Britney Spears's 'Me against the music.'3. Rani Mukherjee loses a significant amount of weight halfway through the movie to convey the hard time her character is going through.4. The speedway races.5. Finally, Bollywood gets the film extras right! They were all so good. There was actually one lady (the JFK passenger) who did an exceptionally awesome job at portraying such a believable extra.6. The kids, especially the girl who plays Priya aka Princess.7. Rani Mukherjee Drunk. LOL!The Lows include: 1. The Preity Zinta wanna-be they cast as Radhika's best friend. Thank God she "like, like, like" LIKED herself out of the film early.2. Playing mix and match with New York locations that don't exist. Um, 180th street is in the Bronx not at Times Square!!!! Okay let's forget about the raceway, what about the children's school which was clearly Brooklyn College which has no private children school on its campus just to mention a few.3. The City of Newyork offers free or low-cost insurance for all residents regardless of status, maybe the writers should have done more research. Somebody at the hospital should have called social services on the parents.4. With all those insane races at excessive speeds through the city that RV did, you would think that the NYPD does not exist her. Not true at all." 
" All happy if end is happy","The story goes on as if the audience don't know what is going to happen at the end. But at each point it predictable.The intention of making the movie was good. The lead character played by Saif is named RV, face some bad days in his life, due to his carelessness about life. But at the end with his heroic attitude he overcomes it. Thats a simple two line story. Off course he was supported by his wife Radhika, (Rani Mukhejee) and his friend Harry (Javed Jaffery). Even his two children are so helpful that they find out that they are poor, and start skipping their lunches, to save money. It is actually at this point, the movie loses the control. Off course everyone goes through bad patch, but this bad patch? Kuchh limit rakho yaar. And finally as usual some accident with the child, which makes situation worse. Saif, Rani and Javed have done a good job. Saif is now too much predictable in this kind of movies. Tell me the difference between his acting in this movie, Salaam-Namaste and Hum-Tum. Rani should start worrying about her age. Though she is still not old for the mother of twos, she is certainly not of the age of wearing minis. Director and writer could have tried some different things, to make the audience more comfortable. The storyline takes turns exactly where it needs to take turns. No surprises. Rani refusing money from her father, Saif refusing to beg from his ex-boss, Javed kicking the money and safe future for his friend, these and many more are the typical scenes/characteristics shown by people in Hindi movies. The only surprise I got is at the end, when Saif actually blown up his opponents car. I thought he will drop the idea of revenge, or may be as shown in movie Car will help that racer to complete the race. But this doesn't happen. Thats different. Over and all this is a good movie to watch with family, and then to forget about it, after coming out of theater." 
" Bore a Rum Pum... Pum","There are few films I think deserve a dismal rating. Like any other end product, I realize a lot of effort goes into the making of a movie. But this flick lacks any real redemptive qualities. It wastes a talented cast, a big budget, good music directors and lyricist. I lay the blame solely at the feet of the inexperienced director, Siddharth Anand. I still can't believe Mr Anand's first movie, Salaam Namaste, was a success. But at least that one had some half decent tunes and an annoying, but entertaining Javed Jaffrey to pass the time. I decided to give Siddharth another chance, after all he was only in his twenties when he directed his first movie. Bad idea. This tale of rags to riches to rags to riches is inane, superficial and boring as hell." 
" Tararararara¬Öentertaining but¬Ö.","¬Öit has nothing new to offer as it's utterly predictable. It's got those usual songs and dances, crying and laughing, outdoor locations etc. Siddharth Anand's second directorial effort shows improvement over his first (the first one being a ripoff of so many films and sitcoms). One thing I cannot understand is why he (or Yashraj films) chose to shoot the film in America? This could have easily been made in India, giving us more of an insight of the beautiful country. Don't we see New York in Hollywood movies and American sitcoms? Yashraj seems to be embarrassed to show India these days. Are they trying to suggest that India does not have locations worth showing in their films? I really liked Saif and Rani's chemistry in 'Hum Tum' which is why I gave this one a go. I wasn't disappointed where the two actors were concerned. Saif sort of repeats his 'Salaam Namaste' & 'Hum Tum' persona but does a decent job. One may wonder if he's trying to be Salman. Why does he have to take his shirt off in every film? Rani is brilliant and looks supersexy in her new look. Javed Jaffrey finally gets a decent part in a long time. Angelina Idnani is good in her scenes but she shouldn't have done the narration. Ali Haji just tries to be cute. Victor Banerjee has about three small scenes. Yet, he makes his presence felt.The technological aspect stands out. Sound effects, visuals and cinematography are almost top notch. Background score is intrusive at times. Songs are forgettable but fit nicely with the screenplay.I watched 'Ta Ra Rum Pum' with little expectation. In any case I wasn't expecting a realistic flick. Hence I enjoyed most parts of it. I wouldn't say it's anywhere near the best films of 2007 but still watchable. It does have its share of excessive melodrama (as almost all recent Yashraj films do) and deja-vu coincidences or accidents. In one sentence, this is more of a family movie, something you wouldn't mind watching with kids around." 
" Something beyond the usual stuff!!!","I'd be honest enough to accept that I had no hope of this going to be a good 3 hrs journey (although Sidharth is one guy, I can surely trust), but after watching the promos and trailer, it seemed to me nothing more than a step (not sure whether good) of Bollywood towards animations and good Kid's movie with all the super-hero stuff like Formula 1 and other cartoon character. However, I'd to say that it was all not true and I am happy for so. I've been a bug big fan of Saif after his stunning make over and not to say, he didn't disappoint me again but is coming up with more and more stronger and mature performances from his good books of acting. I'm sure, this would be amongst his one of all time. All the characters justified to their roles and Javed Jaffery again proves - Why is he class apart? Billy was some one i'd like to replace for no personal reason but the demand of character was for someone more convincing than him. Rani as always, was a treat to watch and her pre-marriage make up, would make teenage actresses to run for their money. But a mature and a rock solid performance again proved, she has lot left in her. The two kidos were good but I liked "Champ" in particular...he was too cute and adorable. Of course this movie treats the kids real well but the reason I like the movie was sending a strong message and love and care shown in a family with a great resilience to be firm in lean period of everyone's life. A worth watching movie with great music (don't know if was copied but sounded good to ears) and some good performances!!!" 
" Great Film despite what other people say,","This is one of my favorite films. Just because of the storyline. It shows how you MUST value money. Stop spending it like a maniac. Rajveer Singh or RV, grows up without his parents. He drops out of school and quickly finds a job, changing tires at for a racing team. He finds his love in a taxi cab, Shona for short. He quickly becomes one of the best and the fastest racers. After a couple of years, RV and Shona get married and have a son and a daughter, despite Shona's father's rejections. Then, RV gets into an accident. He survives and comes back a year later, but he isn't the very same racer as he used to be. The team decides to go to another direction and let's him go. They sign the same racer who caused his accident. The bank forecloses RV's house and his properties. Leaving him with just the families clothes. They then live in poverty in Mannhaten, New York, New York. The family would've been fine if RV had saved some money for the future, but he doesn't. More tragedies rise for the family in a painful struggle. Do the hard ships shut the family down, or does the love fight through. Find out for yourself. YOU WILL NOT BE Disappointed! Hats off to Yash Chopra, Saif Ali Khan, and Rani Mukherjee." 
" Two Thumbs Up!!","Rani & Saif have proved to be the best pair of 2007 with the release of Tara Rum Pum.Everything about the movie is great from acting, dancing , songs, story line to the ending. Saif did an amazing job and he was too funny at some point but definitely changes our mood with his serious acting. He was the perfect choice for this role.Rani, well what can I say other than she is the best actress we have today. Her changeover was mind blowing, from sexy bangs and cute skirts to an emotional mother, she stunningly nailed this movie. Not to mention, this girl is GORGEOUS.Kids were also the main part of this movie, I love how sensitive Princess was, the way she took care of the situation on her own was extremely sad. Love the kids! Director did a fantastic job, this is by far THE BEST MOVIE of 2007. Go watch it people, you won't be disappointed."
