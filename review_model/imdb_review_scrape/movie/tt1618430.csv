" One of the best films so far this year. Kudos to Abhishek Bachchan, Prateik Babbar and Rana Daggubati. Very stylish indeed.","Rohan Sippy, son of the well-known Sholay director Ramesh Sippy, has given us a crime thriller here. I must say the film doesn't disappoint. Very good script.The film starts of well with Prateik Babbar. The pace is fair as the film introduces the characters in the movie and lets you develop opinions of them. Things continue at a fast pace, with plenty of unexpected events along the way, keeping you interested throughout. The music of the film is average. The remix of the famous song 'Dumb Maaro Dumb' doesn't live up to the original from the Zeenat Aman starrer. It is an average item song, after the season of chart-buster item songs last winter. Deepika tries her best to save it, and is helped by the music, which is very good. The performances are good. Abhishek finally impresses after Guru, this time as a cop after the second in the Dhoom series. Prateik impresses again after Dhobi Ghaat. The performance of Rana Daggubati is very good too. Bipasha Basu is OK. Aditya Pancholi does very well indeed. Verdict: go and watch it. It is worth a trip to the cinema (theatre). If you don't, you might just regret it." 
" truly under rated... treat to watch","by saying this i am referring to the critics or the so called TV anchors who receive money for giving the so called stars to the movie... I think they need to change their outlook and take movie or look at it from more public point of view.. Even when i entered the hall i had little expectations, but came out with a smiling face.. the movie is so well crated and so stylishly made that it just takes the breath away.. each and every shot of the film is made with so much to look into it so that u have to look 10 times to get the whole beauty.. abhishek as usual is flawless,rana is impressive so is prateek,while bipasha making her own statement.. the thriller,action,suspense and just everything keeps u jammed to your seat till last.. Sound track is just brilliant and the movie touches you at many instances.. its a must watch.. and surely the movie is not for the duds,who don't like stylish and like family movies.. And uncles...please grow up to the generation" 
" A Nutshell Review: Dumb Maaro Dumb","Item girls are back with a vengeance given the much talked about Sheila Ki Jawani with the midriff baring Katrina Kaif in Farah Khan's Tees Maar Khan, that fast forward till today the buzz baton was ringing very loudly for Deepika Padukone in her item for Dumb Maaro Dumb. But personally I still preferred Sheila for the music, the narrative flow in which it was picturized on, and of course the dance performance. In Mit Jaaye Gum (Dumb Maaro Dumb), Padukone got decked with a shorter dress number sporting a mean looking cobra tattoo, but I don't have a thing for the drugged out look, given this was solely a song and dance number performed at a rave party before Abhishek Bachchan's ACP Vishnu Kamath came gatecrashing with the cops in tow.Dumb Maaro Dumb provided what I would deem as a lift from the rather lacklustre lineup of Bollywood films released so far in this year, with the story keeping it fairly simple, yet intriguing with a mystery, with a great ensemble of actors fleshing out their carefully crafted characters. It's a basic cops and robbers tale on the war on drugs in Goa where the stakes are high on either side of the law with matters and issues hovering around the grey, never outright black or white. Cops are on the take, gangsters can turn informers, and you're never too sure just who you can trust, and who will switch allegiance.Which makes the film thoroughly engaging to follow, paced fairly quickly and clocking just over two hours. The first half of the film before the interval allowed director Rohan Sippy to dabble with a non linear narrative structure to introduce the lead characters, starting with Lorry (Prateik, last seen in Mumbai Diaries), a student at the crossroads of his educational path, being stopped short at clinching a scholarship, and therefore unable to follow his girlfriend to the USA for further studies. Money woes meant subjecting himself to influences from a friend who had persuaded him fast cash from being a drug mule. Then there's the story of ACP Kamath, a once corrupt cop on the take who had now turned his life around given the death of his family, and going all out to take the war on drugs by the horns. The romantic story arc of DJ Joki (Rana Daggubati) and Zoe (Bipasha Basu) has the lovebirds being impacted through the drug trade, with the former being a easy-going, laid back bystander to his girlfriend's woes, with the latter being really hard up to be an air-stewardess, and got sucked into a road of no turning back when short term gains were traded for longer term loyalties.In some ways this is like Brian De Palma's The Untouchables, where Elliot Ness gathers a few good, uncorrupted man to form a core team to challenge the biggest gangster in town, and here, ACP Kamath does just that when he goes up against Lorsa Biscuta (Aditya Pancholi), a well connected and well oiled businessman who dabbles in the drug trade and is one of the biggest in Goa, carved out into various territories as controlled by various foreign enclaves operating the drug business. With ACP Kamath turning the heat on their operations, Biscuita becomes the guarantor of every drug baron's illegitimate business with the involvement of an enigmatic Michael Babbossa, who becomes the primary mystery man that ACP Kamath and team are trying to unravel.So begins a cat and mouse game after the interval, where all story arcs merge into a single thread but between the two halves, the first was more of Sippy's playground with tremendous use of seamless and slick editing techniques and transitions. And something that I've always enjoyed watching is the extended single take of an action scene, which Dumb Maaro Dumb now has bragging rights to, involving a very fluid camera following ACP Kamath and team as they go on a drug bust in a building, continuously weaving into and out of corridors and doors, windows and down a drain pipe even in one long extended take. I'm always in awe given the sheer amount of planning that goes behind the scene to have this achieved, and it is nothing short of fascinating always.The violence is strong as well with ACP Kamath and the villains all dishing out punishment in no holds barred style, whether using a weapon or through their bare fists. And again there will be the usual police tricks and unorthodox techniques used by the no nonsense ACP that may raise some questions, even though he's given the mandate by the chief minister to eradicate the drug problem. It's been some time since Abhishek Bachchan had headlined a box office success, and I'm backing this film to be that shot in the arm for him as he reunites with director Rohan Sippy (since Bluffmaster). Rana Daggubati also shone especially in the second half of the film where his role got expanded and turned meatier, but unfortunately for Prateik he had opened the film, but because of the narrative had to disappear for the most parts in the second half.Still, this is one of the more satisfying Hindi films that I've seen in recent weeks, with a strong story by Shridhar Raghavan (dialogues by Purva Naresh) coupled with strong performances from the ensemble cast that makes you feel for the characters and their predicaments. Music by Pritam stand out excellently, and if you're in need of a good old fashioned cops and robbers thriller with a mix of interesting cinematography techniques employed, then Dumb Maaro Dumb will be your film of choice this week. Highly recommended as it goes into my shortlist as some of the best of this year!" 
" A cop-story against the Goan drug mafia!","What's comes to your mind when you think of Goa? Beaches, parties, hangovers.. Dumb Maaro Dumb starts with a hint of of all that and more – raves, drugs, sex and all that is associated with the mafia in the Goan region. The movie turns into a tale of bad-cop-turned-good; who is stubborn over uprooting the drugs-industry from the whole of Goa.ACP Vishnu Kamath played by Abhishek Bachchan, lost his family in an accident; a car accident which was a result of a driver's drug abuse. This transforms his life and he sets out to transform Goa – his road to redemption. His biggest target is Lorsa Biscuta (Aditya Pancholi), who is the main connect to the foreign mafias, suppliers and the rave parties.Meanwhile Lorry (Prateik) is a minor who is lured into carrying drugs to the US as his fees to a certain university is paid in return, gets caught by the police. This is when Joki (Rana Daggubati) takes centrestage, in order to save the innocent lad, and in turn deliver, what he couldn't to save hi ex-girlfriend Zoey (Bipasha Basu) from entering the illegal world. Thus the two men in redemption work together for the clean-up. And need I mention, truism in a suspense-thriller is not a great news!Rohan Sippy does a fine job as a director, and sticks to his style as in Bluffmaster. But clearly the story of Dumb Maaro Dumb has nothing new to offer – owing to the mega 80s and 90s where a single cop was enough to ask for a super-hero. The difference lies in the theme, where drugs, raves and trance surface up. A bit more research in this field and proper exploitation of trance could have been something fresh; and also justified the use of the song(and title!) Dumb Maaro Dumb. Where Hare Rama Hare Krishna was a depiction of the Hippie culture of the 1970s, this movie tries to relate to the modern Trance era, but in the end is another cop story. Even Deepika Padukone's sensuous attempt falls flat in the Munni-Sheila-era. But the good direction, as it stays, was beautifully covered by the camera personnel. The colors used are perfect keeping in my mind the story and.. well, Goa! The movie does not rely on powerful duologue's alone, as has been the trend recently. Instead, intense scenes and heavy action are the dominant part.The idea of "universal approach" given by Rohan Sippy is not totally baseless, but his claims – "Drug consumption is shown in films only when it is crucial for a script" should be hint of pure Indian-cinema-ness of the script, and the lack of naturality and adventure as much as the original is evident. But I'll accept, the movie is more about Dumb(power & action) than Dumb(drug injection) The music used in this movie is highly ordinary not at all pertaining to the genre and theme(the expected one of course!) of this film. Having a musician(Joki) in the movie is an advantage though, and the song Ti Amo catches on a few lips as people exit the theaters. Sunidhi Chauhan's experiments and the 'potty' lyrics fail to pull off, being the worst expected in a Rave party!" 
" A bold, dark and gritty thriller","First things first; this movie is not your average bollywood 'boy meets girl and then they lived happily ever after' kind of films. This flick takes a look at the dark side of Goa, a side which most movies prefer not to acknowledge. The performances are amazing, be it the determined police officer played by Abhishek Bachchan, Prateik who plays a naive kid who gets seduced into playing a dangerous game, or the altruistic Rana. Bipasha looks gorgeous but proves once again that she is more than just a pretty face. The songs are also very nice. The plot is full of twists and will keep you at the edge of your seat till the very end. That being said, you may find that there are more sad moments than you bargained for. But that just makes it look more realistic. I'll dock one star for screwing up the 'dumb maaro dumb' song which is a classic and another star for stretching out the ending a little bit. A must see for thrill seekers." 
" Finally Bollywood comes up with a decent thriller!","Production values in Bollywood have really gone up and how! The way the story keeps the viewer engaged throughout the movie,tells you that DMD is a perfect example of what happens when you invest in a good script instead of lavishing millions on stupid item songs in foreign locations.Abhi was awesome.You really enjoyed watching him. As far as Prateik is concerned, he really doesn't have much to do-he's adequate but his role could have been done by anyone. Rana was fine in his carefree role but I wish they explained the reasons/motivations for the choices he makes in the second half. Bips is stunning as usual-not much acting expected from the desi equivalent of the Bond girl.Aditya could have been more....villainous. They really need to spend on lyricists who aren't in the second grade.The question to ask is..does the movie entertain...the answer...paissa vasool!" 
" Bandarkar meets RGV meets Sanjay Gupta","Under its tranquil sands, warm waters, vivacious party scene and the susegaad attitude, Goa hides its atrocious face that is smeared with rave parties, drugs, sex and scandals. In desperate times, some ambitious Goans fall victim to the malicious schemes that bring easy money but at life's irreplaceable cost. While the innocent fall prey to the Goan mafia, one man seeks to overturn this nexus and clean up the state of its misplaced virtues. Aided by some 'Untouchable' men from the Police force, ACP Vishnu Kamath heads the relentless hunt for the narcotics kingpins of Goa.Lorry (Prateik Babbar) aspires to join his girlfriend in pursuit of further studies abroad but the denial of his financial aid, leads him to a local narcotics dealer who promises a career as long as he can be their carrier (of drugs). Greed, desperation and the lure of easy money are enough to convince Lorry and soon, he falls prey to the inescapable circle of crime. He is soon sent to juvenile prison, courtesy of Kamath's astute raid at the airport where DJ Joki (Rana Daggubati) assures Kamath of Lorry's innocence but to no avail. Joki's girlfriend from yesteryears, Zoe (Bipasha Basu) had a similar fate when her ambition to become an air-hostess turned fowl and her ticket to freedom from a lengthy jail term was to switch loyalties to Lorsa Biscuta (Aditya Pancholi), the evil kingpin in this entire game. Kamath performs raid after raid in the background of a random rap song and gets ever closer to Biscuta's operations. But beyond this Kingpin is a secretive Lord to whom the mafia turns to in critical times. Who is this Michael Barbossa and what key does he hold to Goa's narcotics crime? Can Joki prove Lorry's innocence to Kamath? Will Zoe break her bonds from Biscuta? Will Vishnu Kamath rid Goa off its poison? On the faces of the multi-dimensional characters who have a marked presence of drugs in their lives, there is a glimmer of hope that life will change for the better. Vishnu Kamath and the drug lords will decide what its price will be.....The engaging narrative is the effect of Sridhar Raghavan's ('Family', 'Bluffmaster', 'Apharan' & 'Khakee') scrupulous writing and Rohan Sippy's slick and crafty film making. A simple Cop v/s Drug peddler story is treated with stylish cinematography, seamless editing techniques, brutal action, convoluted screenplay and adroit direction. Rohan Sippy does not shy away from portraying sex, drug abuse, violence and awkward relationships with liberal profanity. Bandarkar meets RGV meets Sanjay Gupta. The combined effect of it all makes Goa look real and sizzling. Bipasha Basu looks sensational in almost every scene. Somehow, even in a prison cell. We shouldn't mind getting used to seeing her play serious characters after 'Lamhaa' and DMD. Prateik Babbar looks and sounds innocent throughout and instantly commands sympathy while Aditya Pancholi's presence would inspire indifferent reactions. Perhaps such a shrewd character would better suit the likes of Mahesh Manjrekar, Boman Irani, Irfan Khan or even a negative Sanjay Dutt? Rana Daggubati is the film's highlight reel of performances with his susegaad lifestyle causing the bane of his loved ones. Yet, he portrays a reserved determination to make things right by aiding Vishnu Kamath's operation. Abhishek Bachchan has his best film since 'Sarkar Raaj' and clearly, playing the no nonsense cop is better suited to him than being at the other end sometimes as Beera. Playing Vishnu, whose past screams of the horrors of drug use, his unsettled state can only find solace in the eradication of the poison that is absorbed in Goa. The junior Bachchan does not let go of such meaty roles that come his way where his prowess being an angry young man comes naturally on screen. Pritam's music has melodious shades with Te Amo and Kyun Jiye which are brought to life by Rana's on screen romance with the gorgeous Bipasha. The super-hit Mit Jaaye Gum rocks with a scantily clad Deepika and is well suited to the situation. For its witty dialogues, fluid camera work, slick editing, intriguing mystery and stylized direction, Dumb Maaro Dumb does have Dumb in it to provide some different kind of entertainment. Its flaws however, include mildly resonating characters, a Cop-Crime story that is almost overdone and some overly experimental touches such as the rap song in a shoot-out. Yet, it is definitely a worthy watch in the theater for its stylized narration of an 80's theme if not for any moralistic value. The thrill in its succinct length will, at the very least, take you out of your Susegaad of recent films.7.999 on a scale of 1-10." 
" AB in Top Form",""DMD" presents the other side of GOA and in what a way...Simply stylish with all the glitz in place.The plot of the movie is ACP Vishnu Kamat(Abhishek Bachchan) is assigned a task by the GOA CM to clean up GOA coz Drugs is the reason for all the illegal things in GOA(Mafia,Rave's ...etc).Vishnu on the other side has his own demons to deal with.With his choice of lieutenant's Vishnu goes on a spree to Clean up GOA and free the place from the menace and the ball starts rolling. The first half presents the sketches of all the characters.Lorry(Pratiek Babbar) is shown as a student who gets in the drama for his love and professional life. And Joki(Rana) who has some Unfinished business with Lorsa Biscuta(Aditya) gets involved because of his love for Zoe(Bipasha).The 3 crosspaths at GOA Airport where Lorry is caught for possession of Drugs.Joki tries to convince Kamath of Lorry's innocence and helps him just to prove Lorry's is a small fish in the pond.The second half has Kamath looking out for Michael Barbosa.The second half is where the Movie falters from being a good one to just finishing Above Average.The pace just dips a tad due to unnecessary addition of some shall i say...Foolish scenes.It all boils down to finding out the Saviour of Mafia's >Micheal Barbosa in the end and the outcome is not convincing after building up intensity which just dosen't Blow-Off.The background score of the movie is set according to the feel of GOA which is catchy. Abhishek Bachchan in top form(after a long time) playing ACP Vishnu Kamath and plays the character with utmost ease which only he can do.Aditya Pancholi as Lorsa is the perfect Baddie.Pratiek,Bipasha and Rana do fairly decent job,but Abhishek Bachchan Steals the Show in this one.Watch DMD for 3 reasons: 1.A good flick after a long time 2.Entertaining COP-Mafia Thriller. 3.Abhishek Bachchan(who's in TOP Form..)." 
" Cinema is the art to make believe","This movie is an informal lesson for the aspirants to become a film director in future. Cinema is said to be the art of storytelling. But I assert that it is 'the art to make believe', i.e., the art of making the viewers believe whatever is shown on the screen and letting it go down their throats even when it is not real. Dumb Maaro Dumb may be quoted as a classic example of it in the times to come.During the seventies, Salim-Jaaved used to write the scripts of crime-thrillers which were actually the stories of cat and mouse game between the police and the criminals. They were skilled in drafting such spellbinding screenplays (according to the standards of that period) full of blows and retaliations between the two rival sides, thrillng action, witty dialogues and some doz of emotions and romance just equal to the quantum of salt in the recipe of the pulse being cooked and they were paced so fast that the viewer hardly got any time to think anything about the characters or the story, who was made to watch the movie without a blink and holding his breath. Salim-Jaaved wrote the stories of the movies of Ramesh Sippy too during that period whose son, Rohan Sippy has come up with this movie and this movie falls under the same genre of movies, a mesmerizing thriller with an element of suspense too. And it is the screenplay of this movie which makes it a winner all the way through the duration of around 130 minutes. Such type of movies made Amitabh Bachchan a superstar during the seventies and perhaps, it's the turn of his son, Abhishek.Dumb Maaro Dumb, as the name suggests, deals with the illegal business of narcotic drugs with the backdrop of Goa. In between the investigating adventures of the supercop, Abhishek Bachchan; a name is tossed as the main criminal behind all this illegal trade but who is this person, remains a suspense till the climax and myself (being proud of my success in guessing the real culprit most of the times whenever I watch or read a mystery) could not identify him till the storyteller himself revealed the suspense. And that's a great achievement of the narrator, I must admit.The screenplay itself is the hero which rules over all the characters including the investigating cop, Abishek Bachchan. The pace of the narrative is fast enough to keep the viewers glued to the screen and not missing a single moment of the movie. For thriller-fans it's a very big treat indeed.Technically the movie is good and the cinematographer has done a praiseworthy job in not only capturing the beauty of Goa but also moving his camera quite skillfully amidst light, semi-dark and dark sequences. The action scenes are well-picturized and the dialogues are also quite impressive. The production value aspect is also up to the mark. Length of the movie could be trimmed by a few minutes in the second half but still the overall length of the movie is quite OK. The first half is more engrossing than the second one though the suspense factor deepens in the second half only.Music is quite in line with the mood of the movie and according to the scenes running on the screen alongwith the background score. However had Rohan Sippy managed a fresh song instead of the remix of the old hit - Dumb Maaro Dumb from the movie Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971), it would have been better on his part because neither the remix version nor Deepika Padukone is any match for the original track in Asha's voice or Zeenat Aman for the on-screen performance. Despite being the title track, it is the most unimpressive one (both the song as well as the scene) in the movie.Rohan Sippy has extracted highly satisfactory performances from most of the performers. I count Abhishek Bachchan's performance as one among his five best performances till date. All others also fit the bill and almost every principle characters is able to maintain his / her identity in the movie for which the writers and the director deserve a pat. Rana Duggupati and Prateek Babbar stand out among others. The movie stars two of my most favourite actresses - Bipasha Basu and Vidya Balan (she impresses in a cameo too), however the movie mainly belongs to the male cast.I am writing this review after returning from the theatre with my wife who watches a movie with me in theatre once in a blue moon only. Despite not very fond of thrillers or mysteries, she liked the movie very well. The movie proved so engrossing for her that she did not talk much to me during the watch which is unusual for her.It's not a classic movie but a very very entertaining thriller. I don't know whether such type of activities and such type of scenario prevail in Goa or not (where I visited on the Christmas of 2009) but Rohan Sippy has been able to make me believe whatever he has portrayed in Dumb Maaro Dumb." 
" A great movie - totally underrated by Bollywood","Why can't Bollywood start treating movies like Dumb Maaro Dumb with a little more seriousness. Frankly, when I see the "SuperHit" movies like Dabaang, Bodyguard or even Welcome, I ask myself, do they have brain in India??? You gloat making dumb movies like this, and label them as Bollywood's finest? Anyways, DMD is a brilliantly made movie, though the end was a little disappointing, when the plot was finally revealed. 8 out of 10.Btw, if you like Bollywood movies, you are in serious problem, because they make 1 good movie out of 10.Cheers!!!" 
" Could have been an excellent movie...","Most of the movies that we see will either be captivating from the very beginning or will be a complete let down, with little or no fluctuation in the interest factor of the viewer throughout the show, Dumb Maaro Dumb does not fall in any of these categories, it is a movie that starts off with a lot of promise only not to keep most of it. As I said the movie starts of well with nicely narrated introductions, gripping screenplay and building of suspense which keep the movie graph rising on an upward trend, but then comes the interval after which the graph starts fluctuating like an after recession stock market, it falls then rises and then falls again but never reaches to the post interval high, unnecessary melodrama and songs slow down the speed of the movie and the tight script starts to loosen its grip. DMD being a suspense movie could have still scored had that part been handled well but that was not to happen , a good concept fails to deliver because of the poor way it was revealed, the scriptwriter and director should have come up with a better way of revealing the suspense.What I liked: 1) Abhishek's performance. 2) Direction and Screenplay in the first half. 3) Some nice dialogues.What I didn't: 1) Direction and Screenplay in the second half with infusion of unnecessary songs and melodrama. 2) The way revelation of suspense was handled.Verdict: A one timer, that could have been an excellent movie." 
" Dumn good!","Rohan is maturing! Dumb does it for Goa what Blufmaster did for Mumbai. Making the location appear cool and stylish - without faking Goa as in Golmaal.In fact the location and art direction lends credibility to the proceedings and Rohan succeeds!Contrary to what some 'know all' critics pointed at, i think the second half is equally interesting. The story is such that one wants to do some guessing game along the way and bingo! I was right about the 'black sheep'. Other than that it's a surprise! Good performances and here i like to add that Abhishek knows how to act. He is not pretentious nor does he sells himself like some below mediocre actors with the superstar tag. And critics or a certain lobby all out to kill him while criticizing his acting and career why do you forget to mention 'Guru', 'Sarkar' and sequel. 'Yuva'. 'Phir Milenge', 'Dostana', 'Dhoom' and sequel and 'Paa'." 
" Have a puff darling, the movie will blow you!","There was so much of antagonistic vibes about the movie prior to the release.People were more sort of afraid rather than reluctant to see Junior AB in the action after his utter fail "Game". Personally speaking, my mates even bullied me as a goose like die hard fan of Abhishek (Some even felt that I watched premier due to Dipeeka's number, perverts!).Let me clarify in the beginning only that a film cant work on sheer style (eg. Tashan) or sheer story (eg. Salaam - E - Ishq / Dus Kahaniyaan). A film should be okay in all the fields of cinema and brilliant in some of them. Here the movie is brilliant in direction,script and star cast.Jr AB as cop, Rana as DJ, Pratiek-Anaitha as teen lover all are perfect.Bipasha lacks edge.Aditya Pancholi is good.Rest are okay.Screenplay is good. Dialogues are crisp and witty at the same time entertaining.Cinematography by Amit Roy is brilliant. Camera angles have never been more slick.Music by Prittam is a mixed bag.BGM by MIDIval Punditz is mind blowing. Almost Rahmanic! (They are Telefon Tel Aviv for Indians!)A very well directed movie by Rohan Sippy. Full of style and sensibility. This is the third consecutive film of his with Jr AB (Kuch Naa Kaho and Bluffmaster) and the co ordination is clearly visible.So take a puff darling and enjoy this stylish flick!Goa was never so splendorous! Looked as if I was watching Rio De Janeiro. By the time when movie ends, you are smiling." 
" An explosion of drug bomb.","Woman has power to make a man to do everything.same thing can be apply with male characters of this movie.Lorry (Prateik Babbar) is a teenager whose girlfriend has gone to us but he couldn't due to inability of getting scholarship.So to meet his girlfriend he deals with drug supplier and gets prison.Another male DJ Joki (Rana Daggubati) remains silent because of his highly passionate girlfriend who enters in drug dealing in order to be an Air Hostess.Story goes slowly and interacts with new characters in movie with their flash back.In second half ACP Vishnu Kamath(Abhishek Bachchan)is in search of "Barbosa".But Kamath intelligence discovers that "Barbosa" isn't a person.It's a grave where drug mafia used to hide drugs.finally an officer (Govind Namdeo)who assists Kamath is right hand of drug mafia (Aditya Pancholi),it's a nice twist which leads to death of Kamath.Story is good but little slow looks like cop-thief drama.Also the guest appearance of Deepika Padukone in item number which is already a hit.But one thing which definitely makes movie watchable is power pack performance of Abhishek Bachchan and usual performance by Prateik and Rana.Also a nice work by Rohan Sippy after Bluffmaster." 
" 'Dumb Maaro Dumb' really exhibit some 'DUM'","movie contains everything what comes to our mind about 'GOA'.. beaches, Bacardi blast, foreigners,loads of drugs with there mafia distributors, suppliers,carriers, police, bribing and treason. so in nutshell a well executed thriller with twisted tale in the end.starting was bit clumsy with juvenile acting of pratik babbar(lorry). a scene where he cried made me feel how stupid he is to be an actor. Abhishek did his part really well, bips didn't had lot to do.. but one who stood out completely was Rana Daggubati(joki). his screen presence was excellent with natural goan character he was impersonating. Rest did their part convincingly. character sketching was completely on theme.movie had all over different feeling. an appealing locations, fine cinematography(though expected little more because of gr8 camera work at beginning). dialogue were also something which was quite matured and made sense most of the time( far better than Bollywood dramas). black comedy was the theme with some seriously witty scenes.. (that interrogation scene.. LMAO!!!!)i liked songs with Portuguese used heavily throughout d movies in songs as well. but at times songs where over done. direction as u expect after bluff master from rohan sippy was flawless( please don't think about chandni chowk to china).though it would be far fetched estimation to say this movie is revolution in main stream Bollywood cinema but still it had marrow of film making that is a good story and equally good screen play.if u want to watch amazing edge keeping thriller than u wont be disheartened because after long time u will get something nice to watch at theaters from Bollywood." 
" A movie you get to go with cool mind","the starting of the movie is fast paced making you prepare for the ride which it is not so much. Movie is about a drug based Mafia which is spreads all over the state of Goa popular for foreigner and visitors. movie has this similar change in a man from a corrupted cop to a fierce one for the happening to his family.A raid is shown and the fight in those shots is really fake and seems to make you laugh. the movie has quite offensive comment not double meaning but direct which are at time unwanted. the movie is slow for the romance is elongated and the screenplay in the mid of the movie gets boring. new actors in the movie show a prominent acting the plot is week to give too much of substance to them.twist and turn in the screenplay good have been better used accept the major twist which comes towards the end thats the one you would like to see. the movie is average all over with few scenes which can pump your heart a little and dialog here and there which can make you laugh.Its not the directors best performance and things could have been better.it give this movie 5.7/10"
