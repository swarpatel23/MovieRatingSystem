" Even God will say Oh My God What A Movie","OH MY GOD Its the best movie of the year along with Barfi Story screenplay acting everything is perfect. Paresh Rawal and Akshay together created magic as always. Songs are awesome. This movie is the perfect example of how a movie can be good without heroines and item numbers, or action and romance. Paresh Rawal should get national award for this movie,he gave his best. Akshay had a short role but he was best, he was perfect for the role of Krishna. I thought it will be a comedy movie, but after watching i will say the movie got everything, comedy, emotions, love, humanity. This movie is a delight for movie lovers, only few biased haters can dislike this movie. Entry of Akshay Kumar was awesome. Mithun was awesome, loved his character, but Paresh stole the show along with Akshay. Even God will watch this movie and say OH MY GOD what a movie" 
" Love the God!! God is our friend and stays in humans not in stones!! Superb subject","We have always been taught that God is our father always fear God. But this movie say God is our best friend so love the Almighty. Excellent movie with hilarious content.Movie is story of small Gujarati businessman Kanji Bhai superbly played by Paresh who doesn't believe in God. His life take a big turn when he lost everything in earth quake, Insurance company refuses to claim saying this is act of God and can't be claimed.Thus he decided to take big decision and movie is all about that decision.Akshay played role of modern God. If you are thinking that why God is modern go watch a movie you will find a meaningful reason behind it. Akshay is excellent too. Movie criticizes the big business that is based on selling God or we can say playing with emotion of people.God is not in stones or temples. God is in emotions,humans. Do not donate big amount to temples just help the poor and God will be happy. Don't waste your time searching god here and there instead search in humanity. Be fearless and love the God.Must watch" 
" OMG - Oh My God!... Must Watch For All Ages.","OMG Oh My God! Is a wonderful film with an amazing message that everyone should apply in their lives!Paresh Rawal delivers an outstanding performance, one of his best till date.Akshay Kumar is top notch you can't think of anyone to do his role in the movie.Mithun Chakraborty is fabulous as a fraud preacher.Om Puri, Govind Namdeo, Mahesh Manjrekar and rest have played their roles perfectly.There are some glitches in the movie like abrupt camera work but it has nothing to do with the story or screenplay.Grip makes a movie perfect; That's what happens here, you'll get glued to your seats start to end!I don't know how the play was, but I simply loved the movie.After Watching OMG! My religion is OMG! Oh My God!I'll rate it 8/10 Unmissable especially for "so called" religious people wasting time, money, milk and oil at temples." 
" An intelligent comedy","Oh My God is based on successful gujarati play Kanji Viruddh Kanji. Oh My God is a story of Kanjibhai who does not believe in god. One day Kanjibhai's shop gets destroyed in earthquake. Then Kanjibhai complains about God in court. Paresh Rawal is absolutely splendid as a Kanjibhai and his arguments about reality of religion will make you think for a while. Akshay also plays the role of lord Krishna superbly. Surprise package of the film is Mithun Chakraborty. His comic timing is bang on.First half of the film is filled with some good comedy sequences and second half will make you amazed with some heart touching and heart shaking scenes. Main USP of the film is its unique concept. The film ends with a noble message. Story is perfectly directed by Umesh Shukla and he deserve a big cheer.Oh My God is a must watch film for everyone because intelligent Kanjibhai and modern lord Krishna cant be missed." 
" One of the most path breaking bollywood films ever!!!!","WOW, what a film, I was pretty much speechless after i exited the theater. The message this film gives is that god is in every human being, then why do we go looking for him in mandhirs, churches, mosaics, gurdwaras, etc Why has god and religion become a business, why do we spends millions and billions of dollars at religious places as people when we can take that same money and help the poor, won't god be more happy then. This and many more messages are conveyed in this movie through characters, like Kanji Bhai, Krishna, etc Another really plus point about the film is that it is told in a light hearted way, in a comedy, the film isn't very preachy and still conveys its beautiful and real message. For me when it comes to performances Paresh Rawal has just done such an amazing job, he deserves all the applauds, accolades, awards, in the world for his portrayal as Kanji bhai. Akshay Kumar as always is very good in a small but important role, his and Paresh's chemistry is just too good. Other notable performances Mithun, was really good as the sadhu, and so was Govind Namdev. Music was good and suited the film very well. All tech aspects were just perfect. Umesh Shukla the director is the heart of the film and he has done an incredible job, he deserves, a national award for his efforts, he was just that good. A special mention for the amazing dialogues very smart and well written,So all in all this is must watch film for not just the people in India, but for everyone in the world. A masterpiece film, this should be India's official entry to the Oscars. its that good and beyond one of the best movies ever made in bollywood. 10 out 10 rating" 
" The Best movie so far","Oh My God!!!! yes this is what i have to say after watching this movie. Its just superb,it had everything,comedy,stunt,action,fiction,a serious message and a deep emotional connect. This kind of film is a rarity in modern world. This film not only entertains but also enlightens people mind.You are bound to ask certain questions to yourself after watching the film. It thought provoking and your mindset may change after watching the movie. Everything is said in such a gentle and comic manner that the film does not bore a bit. As per acting is concerned well,u can say nothing to the performances by all the character but to applaud and appreciate. Paresh Rawal in the protagonist''s role has been out of the world,superstar Akshay Kumar portrayed the role of Sri Krishna outstandingly,Mithun,Chakravarty,Govind Ramdeo were just fantastic and all other supportive characters lend tremendous support. The main plus point of the film is its novelty in the story,its acting,its direction and the plot.. You are surely getting amazed after seeing such brilliant film and if u miss this then surely you are missing the best Indian film ever. I can and i think no one can give anything less than 10 to this film."

" What a wonderful movie","First time i thought its a copy of Bruce almighty or something, but no, its a whole different concept. I think everyone should watch this movie once. This movie tells a lot of reality which we never know or never wanted to know. But I think Umesh has done a very good job. Even Paresh Rawal has done a great job.This movie is worth watch in theaters. Teaches lots of stuff, depends on you what to take or not.Guys don't think anything, just go and watch.I ll suggest tell your parents to watch this movie as well.I don't want to criticize other movies which copies the directions or screens from Hollywood, but this i feel, everything is original.Yes some of the time you will feel, "aisa real life me kabhi nahi hota". but guys this is movie, and you can learn and take what you want."

There a lots of fun and emotions during the whole Movie and one major thing You wont get bored at all at the End ...This Movie actually pass the message that person should believe in helping other poor person rather than feeding a lord Murti by donation ....!!!" 
" A Reformist and a revolutionist movie.","This review is about how important this movie is for us.The movie is hilarious and i mean it. It is not the cheap dim-wit comedy that people have been relating to Akshay Kumar since a couple of years. The comedy is 10 star.Some critics have given the movie only 3 and a half stars out of 5. However, I say this movie is beyond the scale of 5 or 10. The reason being the effect it is going to or should leave on the Indian society where people live there lives full of superstitions. It is a message against that. And through sarcasm!!. There are many scenes in the film which will make an impact.Example 1. All the religious heads are in a petrified state because Paresh Rawal has sued the almighty GOD in a court of law. They then decide that if his case against GOD is strong, nothing would happen since people in-spite of being educated and learned in school listen and believe them illiterates instead of what they learn in school.So the message is that we are making it too easy for the mullahs, pundits and likes to create problems for us by blindly believing in and following them. They are not any higher or divine beings and their authority should be abolished. Example 2. Mithun Chakaraborty, tells Paresh Rawal that his efforts are in vain because people are God fearing & not God loving. Therefore they will repeat the social evil i.e. commercialism of faith again and again. That is they will go to temples in search of personal gains (rather than GOD) and will spend a lot of money on superstitions to get things done.They can be easily made into gullible fools until unless they realize that GOD needs nothing except love only from the heart. The only movie after three idiots that manages to deliver a strong message. There are just so many messages in the movie. It is for the masses of all religions and no God(if exists)has been attacked. It will reform you. It will make people more tolerable because it gives a message of sanity and peace. We need an open society. Please change yourselves. Watch the movie carefully and learn." 
" A brilliant concept: Not perfect but Excellent!","I have been hearing about this movie from my friends for a few days and at last decided to watch the movie last night. It was a wonderful experience I can tell you that. The strong content of the movie, acting skills of Paresh Rawal,Mithun Chakravarty,Om puri and others have made the movie a tremendous success despite some needless commercialization-tricks and a few weak dialogues. Yes, it is true that the concept of the story is not what we call "original" but the importance to point out our narrow perspective as to religious customs was necessary and the movie is successful in that sense. Although the character depicting "GOD" was unnecessary and probably was there to make a balance. But the movie has genuinely picked the "villains" as these religion-traders are everywhere twisting the original education of religion at their own will, for their own benefit. I would recommend this movie if you too hold humanity above religious fundamentalism." 
" A Brave Attempt!!","First of all let me make it clear that you really need an open mind to enjoy this movie.Some of my friends who are hard core God believers thought that this movie was bit insulting.I strongly disagree. Director Umesh Shukla truly pulls off the movie of the year. Seeing the trailers of this movie I was sure this would create a lot of controversy but seeing that it didn't I guess people too accepted the logic behind the plot.The movie is really fast paced and some of the monologues by Paresh Rawal are worth watching millions of times. Akshay Kumar plays his role as "God" really well but sometimes takes the good guy character so far that it makes one think would this movie have been better with his part on screen reduced a bit.Even though this movie is a brave attempt considering how sensitive people in India are in subjects related to God still its plot is diluted a bit when it is shown that Kanji realizes that there "is" a God .Overall the ending is as good as it could get and leaves one wondering about the situation around.The movie underlines the fact that a good actor can singlehandedly take a movie to great heights. Hats off Mr. Rawal !!" 
" A rightful War against Blind Faith,superstition & rituals","Karl Marx quoted "Religion is the opium of the people".He tried to say Religion is not the disease, but merely a symptom.It is used by oppressors to make people feel better about the distress they undergo for being exploited.As a child I had grown seeing people trying to find solace in laps of some idol or subjected to some uncanny fear revolving around idols or god-men. I tried to understand difference between rituals & religion. This remained unanswered during my growing years.Omg addressed those tactfully without taking any diplomatic or biased stance on the subject. Adaptation of Gujrathi play "Kanji virudh Kanji" which is inspired from an Australian film "The man who sued the God",the story revolves around the life of a businessman Kanjilal Shah who is an atheist and ironically his business is that of selling idols of various gods.Being a person with strong self belief he is never naive to fall prey to the traps of rituals & superstitions.In one dreaded night Kanji's shop got demolished due to earthquake and since it is "act of God" as per the Insurance terms he is deprived of the claim amount.Shattered and angry he registers a case against God to get his money back.Since God's address is unknown he files case against the God-men, saints as they are supposedly agents of God- and thus begins a hilarious ride as one understands the true meaning of religion.Umesh Shukla's film makes a strong case against blind faith.The film has message for both the ends of the spectrum – the atheists as well as the believers.The makers of the film has diluted on the complexities of the play to take it to the mass.Even the executions occasionally drift towards melodrama and become loud but then the end justifies the means.The film is meant to reach a larger audience and the often didactic mode of the film strikes a chord.Bhavna Mandalia's dialogs are spot on with ample support from Shukla's screenplay which leaves an impression in many scenes specially the court room sequences and Kanji's interactions with God.The film rightfully highlights on the fake god-men and how they manipulate the weakness and fear of ordinary men for their own benefits.Referring to holy Gita, Bible, Koran the film points out that God believes in equality but the big ashrams and temples will let beggars die under natural calamity but never allow them to enter. In the talk show sequence Kanji reflects on the corruption within such organizations.Subtly referring to Tirupathi he tells how all the Hairs taken are smuggled to foreign land for monetary gains.Even the so called social service done by all such temples and ashrams are just to convert their black money into white analogical to a Gutkha(raw tobacco) company building a cancer hospital (referring to a dialog in the film).He continues how religion makes one bewaas(helpless) or aatankwadi(Terrorist). The film doesn't attack any particular religion but speaks in a general tone.In one scene we find a Hindu priest, a Muslim Malawi and a Christian priest fighting within themselves about superiority of their "individual" god,while sadly god himself(brilliant portrayal by Akshay kumar) hopelessly looks at the ignorance of the people.The god-men are either shown ignorant and egoistic or intelligent and manipulative.During the climax, God himself tells Kanji that God is omnipresent and the knowledge of divine truth lies within every human which is written even in the holy books but sadly people don't have the time to read them. Over the years they are manipulated and genesis of rituals happened.Sadly even the educated mass falls prey to this over years.A large portion of violence and in-division are existent due to the distorted concept of religion.In one of the heart warming scene we find people are queuing to pour milk over some stone and the whole milk is going out through the drain while a poor hungry fellow looks helplessly at it.Such huge amount of resources are wasted or misused in the name of blind faith.God exists in all of us.To worship him one doesn't need to go to temples and waste crores of money on idols; but one should help people as Swami Vivekananda said "Jibe prem Kore jei Jon Se Jon sebiche iswar" (Bengali) (Those who loves and serves the people are serving the God). Paresh Rawal again proves his competency as an actor and his Kanji will make his position strong among the stalwart actors of the nation.He uses his whole body to emote various emotions.Mithunda is another brilliant actor who can play a disco-dancer or a saint with same conviction. His portrayal of a knowledgeable effeminate saint who uses religious believes to lop off their money is brilliant. He does brings laughter with his gestures and at the same time makes us vulnerable and guilty at the thought of existence of such fake-god men traveling in BMW and speaking of humble existence. Govind Namdeo as the Hindu saint was loud and predictable. He did justify the character he played but could have toned down a bit.Akshay Kumar was restraint and calm which made the audience connect with him as God.Probably this is one of his best performances till date.Om Puri was effective in a small role of Muslim lawyer.The supporting cast were adequate.The characters were too one-dimensional and caricaturist at times but then probably the writer was more concerned on delivering the message than developing them. Low in production value the camera and editing were just about OK.Music was irrelevant in the film though "mere Nissan" song had some strong lyrics and apt visuals that would stay with the audience.The dance song "Go Govinda" was unnecessary. On the whole this is not a path breaking cinema like Wasseypur or technically excellent like Barfi but it has a strong relevant message that needed to be told and they have done it in a commendable manner to reach to an wider audience.It is a must watch-one." 
" Get Enlightened , Get Entertained","Oh my God is a very rare kind of comedy which makes you think and to a greater extent redefines your perception about religion. A very sensitive topic has been handled with grace. And you walk out of the theater thinking about what religion actually means to us. And in this age of mindless comedies , Oh My God is definitely one of the best movies this year and definitely must watch ! Paresh Rawal once again mesmerizes and shows his potential of shouldering the movie single handedly. Paresh Rawal is so very Kanji in this movie and Akshay Kumar for a change is likable. He is very much likable as Modern day God. The movie does get a bit boring in the middle but Magnificent acting by the crew makes up for it.Grab a popcorn and a ticket . . . and a must watch !!!" 
" Best Movie of the Year","Best movie of the year. It's a ride within a soul! A treat which will force you to think what's actually happening in the name of God! Also One of movie which you can watch with your family. All the actors were just too good. Paresh carried the full movie and must be the best person to play Kanji Bhai. Akshay was also a treat to watch did full justice to role he played. Akshay-Paresh are the lethal combination. They are best. Direction was also good. Some people might feel it offended but there is Special Disclaimer for those guys. Watch it with open heart and you will see it will leave a high impression on your life.Highly Recommended! Watch it or regret!!"
