" Heartbreaking Love Story","One of the best Bollywood films of 2006, Gangster is an emotionally charged gritty love story that takes its place as one of the best Indian gangster films ever made, and one of the finest films of 2006, Bollywood or not. On the surface, the film fol...(read more) lows a simple story of a woman (Kangana Ranaut) who falls in love with a man who turns out to be a notorious criminal (Shiny Ahuja), and the consequences of that decision inadvertently lead to a lifestyle she grows to discern. Frustrated with her current situation, she eventually falls into the arms of another man (Emraan Hashmi). Beyond this simple story, what happens next through the narratives many twists and turns makes Gangster a film that will not only entertain, but touch your heart as well. While the film possesses a powerful story, its trump card is the films emotionally charged performances. Kangana Ranaut makes her debut as Simran, and is a revelation. She deserved a best debut win and an actress nod for this, if no t for her other release last year, Woh Lamhe. Emraan Hashmi is excellent but underused as Aakash. This is primarily because he doesn't have too much to do for the first half. He shines in the second half. His best acting stint too date. But the real star of the film is Shiny Ahuja. He is absolutely outstanding as the gangster. The flashback scene, the scene where he breaks down in Kanganas lap, and his violent outburst towards the end of the first half are highlights of the film. This role was definitely award-worthy, its criminal he didn't garner any for it. Shiny has proved, in a short time, that he is an actor of enormous caliber. One of the finest performances of 2006, India or not. Beyond acting, the other star is the soundtrack. A massive hit when it released, its a pity the film wasn't as well received as its haunting score. All the songs are shot well (especially Lamhe Lamhe) and are well placed in the film. As always, the direction is well done by Anurag Basu. He proves hes a director of substance after 2003's moving Saaya. The cinematography is well done. Seoul's photogenic locations are put too good use. Overall, Gangster is one of the strongest Hindi films of 2006, and its well worth checking out." 
" The Best Movie I have Ever Ever Seen","Gangster is definitely the most beautiful movie that has ever been made. It has emotions, suspense, great music and brilliant performances from Emraan, Kanagana, Shiny and also Gulshan Grover.After watching this movie I can say with full confidence that Kangana is going to be a "STAR". I don't think any female in the film industry could have done this movie better than her. Awesome is not even a good enough word for Kangana's performance.Emraan looked handsome with his new glasses look. He played a character very different from his other releases and has improved a lot as an actor. He is already a STAR but he is going to be a "SUPERSTAR"Shiny didn't have much dialogs in this movie but he made his presence felt in a very difficult way which I don't think most actors could have done. He is so brilliant in the movie that you can actually feel the anguish and hurt that Daya was going through. Very Intelligent Actor. Its very difficult to hate him in the movie because his character is the pure definition of a "TRUE LOVER"Scenes to take home with you are, Scene at Seoul Station where Simran betrays Daya Simran confronting Daya outside her apartment.Daya crying on Simran's laps. Akash at the Indian Embassy is a scene beautifully done and does provide a huge shock value. Gangster music, is the best album this year. The meaning of each word in the song is very touching and beautifully done. Ya Ali, Bheegi Bheegi, Lamha Lamha and Tu Hi Mere Shab Hai are songs to remember.10/10 Go watch it." 
" Should be an Oscar Nomination!","Loved every moment of watching this film, when the twist came to play had me on the corner of my seat! Not to mention the amount of tears I shed towards the end. Great story, amazingly portrayed. I think I've fallen in love with Shiny! I must say his character in the film really makes you feel for the guy.. the pain and his feelings, I was well touched in some scenarios of the film. The girl in the film was not only pretty but can act (thank god as shes a first timer). Would recommend this film to everyone. Has the romance but not the typical type that you would see in other films, thriller, mystery.. excellent. The music! it's an addiction to listen to Ya Ali and Bheegi Bheegi.." 
" Sensitive, Sensible, Innovative","I always wonder how come a talented director called Anurag Basu making mediocre films viz. Murder/ Saaya/ Tumsa Nahi Dekha etc when he proved his mettle in TV so well. But with "Gangster" which is definitely his best till date he surely comes up on his own. Another thing, Anurag belongs to that rare species of new generation outside directors who are from small town with neither a film background nor any great film connection or even belonging to a highly privileged class, the descendants of which we see all around in film industry, but a modest struggler who climbed the steps of success with sheer hard work and determination and even fought with blood cancer to win back his life. Such passion is seen in his this work. A love story of underworld Gangster told from point of view of a woman (normally known as moll to others) which is definitely a fresh approach and icing on the cake is the impeccable narrative and innovative style introduced by the director turns it into a passionate drama, which has pace and rhythm to held you captive.. There is a effort to explore how and under what circumstances a woman strays, which is more humane than what you saw so far in Murder or such stuff. How come love brings down a hardcore criminal to his knees and how come same love can be used as a weapon to serve mean purposes is something which should be watched out. An essentially character based film, among actors newcomer Kangana Ranaut and Shiny Ahuja are surprise packets. Debutant Cinematographer Bobby Singh with his highly imaginative framing caught the trauma and turmoil of the characters so effectively that it makes you rooted to your seats. Yes, there are flaws too, viz. how come the woman who is so much in love can't herself preposition her lover to make love to her (gone are the days when men initiate the process) or why a police man mastermind such a complicated plan to nab a criminal rather than directly hold his love interest captive, are things which the script writers know better. Music is another highlight whether it is picturisation or the track itself, just add the required lyricism to the film. I don't want to reveal much but it is definitely a surprise from Bhatt camp too, therefore go catch it as it is definitely one of the best films of this year." 
" Religiously sticks to its story-telling without once stopping to over-sell violence or sleaze","Best of the year so far? Yes - easily. It has a few issues, so let me get them out of the way first: Gangster has some shoddy acting by it's main character, the girl at the crux of a Love Triangle. She has a bad accent, and a stunted way of speech. Her arms are around one Emraan Hashmi who does lip-lock. But with all your pre-conceived notions of him, he is not easy to dislike. And the pay-off for that is pretty nice. And as is usual for Bollywood movies, the movie does go through some unnecessary melodrama, but thankfully these are just three short ones.What really is good about this movie is the writing. Director Anurag Basu has written the movie with a very clear idea about what he intended to depict. Yes, we have a gangster, we have foreign locales, and we have a "sexy pair", but the movie religiously sticks to its story-telling without once stopping to over-sell violence or sleaze. The whole narrative plays like a solo violinst playing through a single-long piece with its share of happy/sad portions and a few crescendos at the right times with some recurring themes. So much so that it is easy to be sucked into the whole flow and go along with where the director takes you.Anurag Basu is good. His second movie (I thunk), but he clearly has his own language of cinema. From the shot-arrangements and camera angles to the score and songs, this man plays it like he cares for his movie, and not for the producer's coffer. He tells us the story mostly in flash-backs - but with decent inter-cuts to make it not entirely linear. The movie moves along a relaxed yet fast pace. It reminded me of cruising in a luxury car at 180Kmhr. You are speeding, but very comfortably.The movie follows the story of one-girl (Bar dancer, yawn!) who a Gangster falls for, rebels against his gang, goes on the run, then puts her away safe and stays away to keep her safe. After holding-on for years she, in her loneliness, falls in love with another man - just when the gangster comes back. Clashes, loyalties, retribution, betrayal, vengeance.Shiny Ahuja shines (sorry, couldn't resist) as the titular Gangster. His going from unspoken emotionless man to unspoken jilted lover to unspoken "karma-yogi" works very well mainly for his intensely masculine persona. How good is he as an actor will take something against his type to prove. But he fits here perfect, and within the world of this movie, the man is like the writer's imagined.Watch this movie if you can catch it sometime soon. It's worth at least that much respect.Rating --> 4 of 5" 
" A must see.","'Gangster' was a wonderful and refreshing change from the typical romantic film as well as the underworld cinema that Ram Gopal Varma's camp dishes out. 'Gangster' is in a genre unto itself. This films proves that a tight script is king above all else. There have been many Bollywood films that claim to be love stories and claim to espouse the virtues of love. Here is one that spell-bindingly and mesmerizingly shows you what love really is. What it means to really sacrifice for another human being. What is even more remarkable about this film is that it shows you all this through a lead actor (Ahuja) who does not have much by way of dialogs. His role in the film, the message of true sacrifice that he portrays, is mainly via body language and facial expressions. And oh what language and expressions they are! Anurag Basu has truly grown leaps and bounds from his 'Murder' days. The performances, direction, screenplay, cinematography, and music all form an organic union to become one cohesive, edge-of-your-seat story. This movie has its hold on you until the end. It goes by fast and yet slowly at the same time. The songs in the film weave a tale and progress the story along and make you feel for the characters even more rather than being an excuse for a five minute break.As I said this film critically depends upon the script and the performances. I never would have guessed that this was Kangna Ranaut's debut into Bollywood. Hers was a performance of a seasoned actress. Her portrayal of a tormented alcoholic who is torn between the man she once loved and the man who can possibly fulfill her every dream was spot on. Having said that though, the film belongs to Shiny Ahuja. He had to convey love, passion, and the obsession he feels for a woman, mostly through non-verbal means. This can be a point of weakness in a film if not handled by the right actor. Fortunately, Mr. Ahuja was not only up to par but surpassed all expectations. He made you feel Daya's pain, anguish, conflict, and above all else, his love for a woman and how far he would go for that love. His performance in the scene at Seoul Station is one that should be kept in mind during awards time.All in all, this is a must see film which will leave you speechless at the end. It shifts the idea of a Bollywood love story to a whole other hemisphere. If you like a movie that has been well thought out and well acted and does not insult your intelligence or emotions as an audience member, then I highly recommend this one. I hope to see more such diamonds from Messrs. Basu, Ahuja and Ranaut in the future!" 
" Truly amazing... and unexpected","This has to be the best film i've seen in 2006... ever since i read the review online i was dying to watch the film... and thankfully i was not disappointed with the performances and storyline of the films. The film is executed in a flashback fashion and slowly event unturn revealing plenty of unexpected twists even till the end of the film. This film does not use much dialogues but the music and facial expressions of the actors play a great role in expressing the mood and storyline.. and shiny ahuja, the guy with the least dialogues, makes the BEST impression! Songs are at the minimal best, without distrupting the story... kangna (the lead actress) is great in her first film, though her dialogue delivery and diction isn't perfect, it adds authenticity feel to the movie... emraan hashmi makes a great impact... on the whole.. i am impressed.. and looking forward for more films by anurag basu.. original ones at that!" 
" One of Bhatt's Best films","Usually people say Bhatt films have lot of sex, hit music, titillation and no story But this film and some more proved them wrong Actually that 4 things suit Yashraj films moreGangster is one of the best films from Vishesh filmsThe story sounds complicated but the director and screenplay writers make the film one experience to cherishThe love story between Shiny- Kangana, Kangana suddenly falling for Emraan and then her confusion whom to choose and the betrayalAll is handled very well by Anurag BasuThe emotional breakdown of Shiny and the climax is one of the best written scenesAnurag Basu gives his best work so far Music(Pritam) was superb, especially Ya Ali, Bheegi Bheegi, Tu Hi Meri Cinematography made the film more appealing Performances Kangana was one of today's rare heroines, she made her debut in such a spectacular way that all remained stunned and she earned a big name with this film, except her diction and her shouting at placesShiny Ahuja was amazing in his role and performed brilliantly He got least dialogs but did a great job with expressions His emotional breakdown towards the end is one of the best part of the filmEmraan Hashmi surprised, he gave a restrained performance and didn't overact or make funny expressions even once as he normally doesGulshan Grover got a wonderful role and he did a great job despite being a short role" 
" Mindblowing...","I didn't expect myself to love this movie. But when I heard some rave reviews about it, and caught it on a late night show on TV, I watched it spellbound. A different and enthralling plot, fantastic performances by the actors, OUTSTANDING music, and fabulous cinematography and direction. The acting was superb. Even Emraan Hashmi (who I cannot stand), did an above average job. Shiny Ahuja was flawless in his character. He showed every emotion and movement brilliantly without fail, and does not let you down for a single moment. However, the movie belongs to Kangana Ranaut. For someone making a debut, she was just fantastic. She seemed so comfortable and well-cast for the role that I cannot imagine anyone else doing this role, and to be honest I never would have thought this was her first film. She pulled off a very tricky role with ease, and I really liked her performance, there was something very real about it. Also, she did such a good job with her character, Simran, that it seems like she is like that in real life. Hopefully this isn't the case!Performances aside, another thing that struck me hard was the music. I am more likely to enjoy a film if it has excellent music, and that is exactly what happened with Gangster. It is very impressive. Ya Ali, and Lamha Lamha are my favourite tracks, but I also enjoyed Tu Hi Meri Shab Hai, Bheegi Bheegi, and Mujhe Mat Roko. In short, each song was amazing.Gangster is a bit of a mix of a thriller, romance, crime, and drama. This is what makes it special - Anurag Basu has indeed done something much more worthwhile after "Murder". I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout." 
" Best Bhatt Movie I have seen...","This is by far one of the best movies that I have seen from the Bhatt camp. I highly doubt that this is directly taken from a Hollywood movie like Murder was. After seeing the movie, I liked its uniqueness -having scenes in Seoul, a different city from the likes of Geneva and New York, was an added bonus. Acting wise, I have to give it up for Kangana as she carried this movie through her character and excellent acting and facial expressions. There is more to this girl than simply her beauty and she is definitely here to stay. Emraan did a good job for his role and Shiny was simply shining as usual in his gangster role. I liked this movie way too much and hope that Kangana is able to win some awards this year for Debutante as Shiny did last year for Hazaaron Khwahishen Aisi. Overall, a must see!" 
" Gangster","When I saw the film Gangster I was amazed at how wonderful it was. The acting was brilliant and the story line was good. It is not your average Karan Johar love movie. It is wonderful the way they act and the feeling they all put into it. The ending was killer and it made the movie. Unlike a lot of other movies that I have seen, this movie makes you feel for the characters. When they are in pain it's like you are in pain. If you sometimes cry in movies get a tissue box. This movie had great actors in it and they all showed a lot of emotion. This film was truly a beautiful film. The upcoming movie Woh Lamhe stars two of the main actors that were in this movie. I really hope you find this comment useful and watch the movie." 
" Shiny gangster","Someone just wrote a good review on this..I can add.. yes a very well made movie. The way the movie unfolds, the beautiful Seoul, a pretty drunken girl, a smitten lover, some shootings and the story told through the ventilator final breaths of the girl.Only i do wish the dialog could have been better. It is terribly stilted in some place, too wordy in others. Thoda sa natural bhai, in keeping with the mood of the movie. So while Akash and Simran are prattling away long predictable lines, Daya hardly gets any. There is this scene where Simran confronts Daya after he bashes up her lover Akash... Talk to me Daya she starts .. none of the "peichan kaun" of Naveen Pal here. This Bar Girl has class. But then she carries on and on while shiny emotes excellently his frustration at finding simran kissing another guy goodbye after an obvious night of sex. At the end of the long harangue, he simply turns and slaps her. The audience roars its approval.Kangana Raut manages well. She looks hot and does as much justice to the role as she can. Emran Hashmi also manages good. He gets a nice song to sing at his lady love, and also gets to kiss the girl.The star is shiny shiny Shiny Ahuja. His acting is amazing. From first scene to the last, he is extremely convincing.Wow man, that name on the marquee, me in queue-ee ! forever !" 
" Powerful, complex story of human love and turmoil","Gangster is a powerful and dramatic film that departs from the typical movie format and presents a complex love story where morals become entwined. The movie is shown through the eyes of Simran, a woman enduring a terrible turmoil. However, all three major characters have gray shades and are shown to be human. They endure hardships, fall prey to temptations, and struggle to do what their heart tells them is right. It is difficult for the audience to decide who or what is right and wrong, who is a protagonist and who an antagonist, making the movie ever more mystifying. All one realizes is that this movie is as real as its characters, their situations, and their actions. Shiny Ahuja is absolutely fantastic! All of his performances from Sins to Karam are superb. Kangna gives a good debut, although her dialog delivery is a bit odd. Emraan Hashmi has also matured as an actor. Songs are addictive! Tu Hi Meri Shab Hai, Bheegi Bheegi, and Ya Ali are all mesmerizing tracks with a deep soul. This is most definitely the best soundtrack of 2006 so far and the highlight of the movie. Footage of Korea, which has never been captured on Indian film, adds even more freshness to the movie. The setting in Seoul (foreign people, cold climate, harsh metropolis) and the blue filter also do a good job of bringing out the loneliness, turmoil, and confusion that the characters are enduring." 
" Awesome movie with terrific climax,unexpectable mystery and with beautiful songs.","Really an amazing and awesome film after a long time and of coz it has my fav actor Emraan.The story was excellent.The climax was awesome.And really the suspense was unexpectable.The direction was superb from Anurag Basu as expected.The screenplay was nice.Very well written by Mahesh Bhatt.The dialogues were awesome.And the songs were really beautiful.Especially Tu hi meri shab hai and yaa ali are one of my Favs.The acting was terrific and one kind of awesome from Emraan hashmi.He is born to play these kinds roles.The acting from kangana was good.So guys it really an awesome film please do watch this film.I bet you will like this one." 
" violent movie","No wonder it's an 18:this is a violent movie. It has a really good twist in the second half of the movie. What the weird thing was everyone ended up dead. I mean the criminal don died, the gangster died the girl commits suicide Akash dies. Also when Simran goes to Akash's house he gets shot in the shoulder then shot three times in the back and still lives to shoot Simran before he died. He should have died straight away after the first shot in the back. The spinal thing connected to the brain gets damaged so he should have died. It was a good movie, more than enough violence and a great twist in the middle. Great movie-9/10" 
" Ace!!!","I really enjoyed watching this movie, it lots of action and the music was the best music i heard in 2006, i just loved it!!.Emraan's role was a negative role but one of his best performance to date u think, he is a great actor and i just hope that he continues to make more great films like this one in the future.Kangana's debut performance was just mind blowing, she played her part so well and is extremely beautiful and talented, i can't wait to see more of her upcoming movies, she was just excellent in the film, i haven't come across an actress that has done do well in their debut performances in a long time, kudos to her and the best of luck in the future.Shiny was great in the film even though his character dies, aww and also and the thing about this movie was that you could go and watch it over and over gain and not get bored. Please go and watch this film"
