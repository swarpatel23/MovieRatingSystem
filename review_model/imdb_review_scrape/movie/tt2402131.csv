" It was superb watching this Comedy-Thriller!","Went to see Kismat Love Paisa Dilli, this weekend with buddies. Cudn't find any reason for criticizing it. It was nice and superb(some more adjectives to go with it too!) The comeback of Vivek-Mallika pairing and the directions of Sanjay Khanduri gave immense pleasure with comedies and suspense. I had also seen the award winning debut directions of Sanjay Khanduri, Ek Chaalis Ki Last Local, so decided to give it a try on my weekend. It made my weekend, enjoyed it a lot! The lovely songs Dhishkiyaun and Appy Budday were appropriate to the rhythm and thoroughly grabbed their space with much precision. Moreover the entire plot of comedy, suspense, Kaptaan's robbery (not to forget his birthday celebration also), suicide of Aarti and the pizza delivery boy along with our Lokesh and Lovina was well synchronized. A unique way of casting an exclusive storyline can only be expected from an accolade director. The midnight hour depiction of a love story is very rare in the Bollywood mainstream movies. The audience response of this Last Metro theme will surely be more than the audience applause received from the Last Local. I don't find any reason of deploring. I would rather be more affirmative in my view and would say that everyone should have their way of perceiving. I felt it awesome and for others I would say, Give it a watch and its sure to worth it!" 
" Brilliant Flick","On insistence of a friend i went to see this film. Film is about a boy who thinks he is never gonna sell his soul and be corrupt. But moment comes and with big money in front his ideals shake and he gets bribed like rest of the world. This theme itself was so deeply touching to me that I could not understand why critics had trashed the film. Why there was a ruckus on gay humor. I Just loved the film. It is modern day 'Jane Bhi Do Yaaron'. Its a fun film with loads of dark and slap-stick humor which has a message for a common man to stand against corruption. The whole PVR theater was in splits when Kaptaan Saab played by Ashutosh Rana compares his loot small in front of what government is looting that sweet shop wala. Truly genius writing. Go for it eyes closed." 
" Loved Watching it this Weekend","We buddies had a special weekend this time watching out Kismat Love Paisa Dilli. Vivek is my fav so I had a special interest in watching this movie. We entered the hall and the moment the movie started, guess what? Not only had I rather the entire cinema hall echoed with laughter. It was a fantabulous performance of Vivek I must say. Despite his age he has portrayed himself as a typical, cool 25 year old college going flirty lad. And who could have better played the role of a fashion show anchor, other than Mallika. The cast selection was very precise and appropriate, supplementary to the romance in the midnight hour's silent Delhi road. The crispy comedy, hilarious acting and funny dialogues are all superb and in sync to the plot. Ashutosh Rana as Kaptaan stole the show. I still laugh aloud when I remember his robbery logic and birthday celebration. His rolling eyes with a bit of confusion during his birthday celebration made my stomach ache with laughter. I was amazed to see the serious side of Mallika with "no non-sense" this time. Really, she is a versatile actress. Seeing the earlier movies of her I had never imagined that she has such height of flexibility in her acting! This movie is as approbating as the previous one. After seeing this film I am very much assured of the storyline of Sanjay Khanduri. I would surely go to the theatres a bit early next time, if it's a Khanduri directions coming up." 
" Great film with a message.....","It's a great film with a message.....It's a cult stuff from this director. Never seen dark humor and glitz go so effortlessly to give an entertaining film with a deep message. It will be bigger than Ek Chalis. People who may miss will see it on DVD and recommend. Sound track is amazing..... Just bought audio album as loved songs too. Background is superb and energetic. For a change Mallika is portrayed as a lady and not as an item gal. A younger girl though would had been better. Vivek surprisingly pulls off well as a young college boy almost 13 years younger to wot he must be. Ashutosh Rana rocks....loved him and his gang the most on the film. Full of entertainment film." 
" The epic comic thriller","The protagonist of this film is Vivek Oberoi, playing a prankster Dilliwala, Lokesh Duggal, who follows after a pretty fashionista (Mallika Sherawat) from a fashion show to the nearby Metro station, hoping to score with her. Unknown to him, a tape has been snuck into his waistcoat pocket that has a sting operation of the minister which is being searched by everyone from a sinister minister and some corrupt cops, to an NGO looking to expose the minister. Along the way Lokesh has an unfortunate run in with a ear-biting delivery guy (Anshuman Jha whose character was unnecessary), and a gang of petty goons led by a slap-happy boss (Ashutosh Rana). How lokesh with his love interest Lovina make their journey back home through one quirky night of Delhi is the rest of the story. The slap stick comedy and some sensuous dialogues makes the film stand out. Sanjay Khanduri has delivered and made some scenes genuinely funny. The music is lively. Vivek Oberoi plays the horny opportunist pretty much convincingly." 
" Simply hilarious!","After contemplating for about an hour about which movie we should go to watch, me and my friends settled for KLPD (Kismet, Love, paisa, Dilli) on Saturday. (Secretly I hoped to catch the other one Sri Devi starer English Vinglish on Sunday) As my friends were not in a mood to watch any family drama and we were only out to have some plain, wild fun. To admit it, I had to be dragged along as I had no interest to watch this one. But as I started watching the movie, my mind was completely swirled by it. I was completely taken by surprise with the superb acting of Vivek Oberoi as an opportunist who looks to reap the benefits from any kind of situation. Honestly I had made up my mind to sleep through the movie but on the contrary I could not blink my eyes in fear of losing a single second of the film. I have to thank my friends for this or else I would have completely missed out on such a good movie.Anyways the film starts on a promising note, like every other guy next door; Lokes Duggal (Vivek Oberoi) is the imperfect middle class prankster studying in DU. He helps out a friend with a fashion show and is immediately attracted towards the show host the lovely Lovina (Mallika Sherawat) and tries to score with her. They don't seem to hit it at the first meet but Lokesh tries to follow her to the nearby metro station to catch the last metro back home. The two start of on a bitter note unaware of the fact that the night has something else in store for them. Lokesh is mysteriously involved in the murder of a mystery white sari clad woman (Neha Dhupia) at the metro. In all these mayhem, a man snuck a tape into the waistcoat pocket of Lokesh. And guess what! It is the string operation tape of the ever sinister minister. From here starts the topsy-turvy turn of the mad events, that follows all night for Lokesh. The cops and the dangerous men of the evil minister are after him as he tries to give the slip to the cops and run from the scene. What a dramatic situation to be in isn't it? However he again runs into Lovina who also has missed her last metro (a big co-incidence don't you think?) together they try to hail a cab and go back home. In their journey they accidentally run into a desperate delivery guy who literally bites ears of people (Creepy) and a gang of petty thuds whose leader is the slap-happy boss Kaptaan Saab (Ashutosh Rana) who has a record of slapping random people (Talk of some hilarious record!).Lokesh and Lovina even meet the colourful Delhi characters dancing sardars of the lavish Indian engagement set up. At the set of the dawn both are faced with the final hurdle, with Lokesh contemplating about whether or not to sell his soul to the minister for a bigger price. In the heart touching end though he does, he leaves a strong message to the common man. I have to admit to my utter surprise I loved watching this film. Sanjay Khanduri has made this film genuinely funny with all the slap-stick comedy and weird jokes standing out. The punching one liners definitely adds the needed masala to the movie and makes it really worth watching. Some stellar comic performances and peppy numbers make this movie highly recommended! Go for it guys!" 
" Great movie","A great movie, incredibly hilarious. Maybe even deserves to be called Hindi Pulp Fiction. If you liked Delhi Belly, you will likely love this one. Vivek and Mallika were awesome. The songs are funny. The one on 'captain Saab' was hilarious. 'Jackie Chan' is over the top. If you are willing to laugh, you will laugh your guts off with this one. It has Jaats, Sardars, Delhiwallahs, everything a funny movie should have. Don't try to find a shawshank redemption in this movie, or you will be disappointed. That probably explains the bad review the 'critics' have given this movie. This is the first review I have written. And that's because I think the movie deserved it." 
" Great Entertainer","One of the finest comedy film I have seen till now. Brilliant performance by the Actors with an excellent casting. Hence, this film consisted all those elements of entertainment which were necessary like Action, Drama, Emotion, Thriller,Romance, etc.Though the film didn't worked well on Box Office yet I loved the film. I think it was only due to the internal politics that the film was resisted to get succeed........ I shall prefer all guys n gals to see this film don't believe on the Box Office ratings. KLPD is therefore the coolest comedy film of 2012. I also like the character of "Nunnu", "Kaptaan Saab", Lokesh the most. Nunnu created a comedy punch in the film, hence awesome casting was done." 
" Nice Fun","When did this flick release just didn't know. Saw it randomly yesterday at a friends. Got hooked because it's so funny. You gotta have lived in Delhi to feel the humour. One night roller coaster film. I also liked the music in background in some places is really cool and funky. But seriously songs were unnecessary. Never been fan of Vivek but he seemed doing good and was funny as a guy stuck. The night characters like pizza guy or goons were really hilarious. Opening of the film grips you really when the mysterious girl appears. Loved Ashutossh Ranaa as Captaan Saab & his team. : ) Sardars Vs Jatts was a killer. Little loose at some places. But fun film for sure." 
" A Full-on Delhi film","Director Sanjay Khanduri has made a full on Delhi film he has show the reality of Delhi in this film with a message of Corruption done by a sinster Minister. Having a serious concept of Corruption yet Mr. Sanjay presented the film in an enjoable manner. I enjoyed the whole film a lot. Its worth watching. This film had brilliant actors good songs and all those elements which a masala films needs to have. But due to the war between Salman and Vivek this film didn't worked well. Its all politics here too! Well I liked Kaptaan saab played by Ashutosh Rana as he did a different kind of role as well as I liked Nunnu the most. He was awesome and full-on funny guy. Therefore the film was excellent.....I liked it a lot and Vivek is my favourite for sure." 
" Its like a low grade, fake version of EK CHALIS KI LAST LOCAL (2007)","The year 2012 has given us many worth watching films based on some novel story ideas. But even in this new welcome scenario, still there are few directors who continue to face the same old crisis of fresh ideas like never before. And one of those creative captains of the ship is the director of KLPD, who quite strangely makes his second film too on exactly the same subject, which he had earlier used in his debut venture.Director Sanjay Khanduri made an off-beat yet entertaining film called EK CHALIS KI LAST LOCAL in 2007 which was based on a one night story featuring Abhay Deol in the lead. It was about a young man travelling in the Mumbai local train, who unintentionally gets caught in the web of prostitutes, dons, drugs, gays and corrupt officials, but in the ends incidentally gets loads of money in return of his painful sufferings of the night. Now after 5 long years the director of ECKLL makes his second film, questionably choosing the same kind of concept and script again as if there are no other ideas left in the whole world. And the only 'creative' change in the script is that this time its not the Mumbai local but Delhi's Metro which remains the center point of the plot and nothing else.The hero gets caught in exactly the similar kind of situations (given a Delhi-sh make-over), meeting the same kind of people in the whole night and then also gets some loads of money in the end as it was there in the original. The film decently manages to impress in its first 20 minutes as you don't really know what its all about exactly? But once it starts giving you the same content like ECKLL then one really feels like cheated and being taken for a ride with a pretty bad second half. Hence in my opinion KLPD is a perfect example to prove that a certain section of film-makers still love to consider the viewers as complete fools who can be served the same film twice featuring different actors and background after a gap of few years.To be honest, Sanjay's first venture ECKLL was a much better product which won more appreciation later after its home video release. But here in his second attempt the director tries some cheap tricks too beginning with its title itself which has also got a vulgar double meaning when written in abbreviated form as KLPD. Further, the Delhi Punjabi lingo utterly fails to hit the right note with the wrong pronunciation of few words by Vivek Oberoi who simply looks fake from the first scene itself. But more importantly, in order to get some instant attention, the makers here seem to be only interested in portraying the city of Delhi, full of sex maniacs roaming freely over the night as if there is a "Jungle Raaj" kind of situation which even includes the Police in it. And that's where KLPD goes too far in its over the top narration, not able to make any kind of comic or realistic connect with the audience.The film has sequences which can be easily termed as childish as well as vulgar in execution and it has actors who try too hard to make their presence felt without any positive results. The humor doesn't work at all and it even becomes irritating at times with weird characters such as the delivery boy turning into a jumping vampire with some bizarre super-hero powers. So if Vivek Oberoi chose this film to be his first release after the long break then he surely needs to appoint someone else to choose few good meaningful projects for him in the future. And the same can be said for Ashutosh Rana who also does a role which is much below his own proved caliber and on screen persona. Mallika Sherawat does nothing different from his previous films and Neha Dhupia must have done it as a favor. However, there still is one plus point in the film's soundtrack which has two catchy & enjoyable songs, "Dhishkyayun" and "Appy Budday Manayenge", perfect for all DJs to use at their dance floors. But apart from this single merit, KLPD can easily be rated as a daring venture which openly insults the creative intelligence of its own viewers quite loudly. So you can easily give it a miss for something better." 
" Superb Comedy","This film Kismat Paosa Luv Dilli is a superb comedy stuff. Excellent work done by the respected Director Mr. Sanjay Kahnduri. After the success of the film ,"Ek Chaalis Ki Last Local". I found this movie KLPD an awesome comedy and it was full-on laughter. The song were good specially "Appy B'Day". Besides songs,Actors did a great job. Mr.Khanduri showed the real face of Delhi people with a great Haryanvi accent. Vivek did a good performance and justified the character of "Lokesh". Ashutosh Rana did brilliant performance in his character "Kaptaan Saab" The character "Nunnu" created a great laughter. While watching the film the part I enjoyed the most was when "Nunnu" fights in a party and bites the ear of a guy and he jumps here and there. Hence, this movie is worth watching, if anyone is feeling bored or depressed shall go to see this film, it shall definitely make them burst out of laughter...................." 
" Awesome Comedy","KLPD is an awesome film and vivek, Nannu, Kaptaan Saab were too awesome. They all did a great job and were very entertaining. The concept of the film was very nice and different with a great humour in it. It actually showed the real face of Delhi and about the corruption in Delhi. Song were good and I loved "Happy B'Day" one the most. This is a must watch film and one of the good thing is that it didn't had any vulgar comedy. So any one can see this film. Thus, I loved the film a lot. The critics didn't liked the film a lot I don't know why! this film had all those stuff which can create laughter and it had all that madness etc." 
" Madness with a message of Corruption","Kismat Paisa Love Dilli is one of the most comedy film I have ever seen, it consists all those elments of laughter, emotion, action, thriller, etc. Its has a perfect story line that how a guy named Lokesh(Vivek Oberoi) a cool and a flirt Delhi boy gets stuck into a serious problem and also falls in love with Lovina (Mallika Sherawat). The whole story is based on a cold night in Delhi and revolves around Lokesh and Lovina. Though the moral of the story is "Corruption" but the Director Mr.Sanjay Khanduri presented the film in a very brilliant manner which included entertaining stuff as well... All the Actors did their jobs awesome specially I liked characters such as Nunnu, Kaptaan saab, Lokesh and that Gay Fashion desinger. Overall I shall say that the film was entertaining as well as with a message. This didn't worked well its only because of the cold war between Vivek and Salman Khan. According to me its only Salman Khan who tries to pull down the film in various manners. Otherwise this movie was a Super hit. I shall vote this film 10/10" 
" Content Respect","I am watching KISMET LOVE PAISA DILLI....and I am really enjoying and appreciating the content based on corruption because of which whole India is suffering.And the Director of this film A PERFECT SYNONYM of the word INTELLIGENCE who showcased a very serious matter of corruption in a very light and entertaining way....A must watch movie........and do not disturb movie :-) I mean to say Just MOVIE and POPCORN :-) without any disturbance...People have forgotten how to tell a story. Stories don't have a middle or an end any more. They usually have a beginning that never stops beginning.Means instead hearing from media about the corruption disrespect for the womens you will be in a zone of witnessing the same situation while watching this film. ITS Really A MUST MUST & MUST WATCH MOVIE.." 
" super ultimate comic thriller don't miss it...!!!","a sequel to 2007 hit thriller ekchaliskilastlocal will again never disappoints the story followed in one night which includes hilariousness beyond words super comic thriller the main ascent of the movie is story,comedy,movie disscused about the corrupt politician and how lokesh end up accidentally involved with them and how he can save himself from the danger seriously from the whole time u wan't stop laughing with some hilarious characters introduces in the film specially thief group and a delievery boy whenever they came u won't stop laughing and how these 2 involves in the story making it more hilarious,very well made thriller,don't go with critics do watch it this movie includes very special message watch it again and again u will love it"
