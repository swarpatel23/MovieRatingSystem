" Better than the original movie.","Since I watched the movie Meet Joe Black with Pitt & Hopkins three years ago I enjoyed the story already. However this theme is not an easy one to play out considering, the supernatural and concept of 'angel of death'. Mere mortals acting this out could constitute a mocking of ideas some sincerely believe in. Even though Shukriya is no doubt broadly based on the same story lines as JoeBlack, it has however done more justice to the theme. This being simply because the theme is less alien to Indians' audience and the entire concept of angel of death is typically Asian. Take for example Oppenheimer's famous quote when he invented and detonated his famous A-bomb, which he himself claims to have taken from the Gita, relating to the personification of death. Where J.Black more closely resembles sci-fi, Shukria articulates it more spiritually refined. The idea was always an interesting one, but Anupam Sinha seems to do greater justice to the theme than Martin Brest. A western viewer however would do without the lengthy music video's scattered throughout Shukriya, which get tedious especially because of the deep language but summary translation. I however enjoyed the Indian version more, which not only combines life and after-life better, but also east and west and a number of other great equations."
