" A Vintage Masala Entertainer!","A remake of the 2003 Tamil film Saamy, 'Policegiri' is Vintage Entertainment. It rests on the tried & tested formula of action films of yore. It offers nothing new in terms of storytelling, but its still fun to watch, as it stays true to the genre & delivers exactly what it promises: Time-Pass Entertainment.'Policegiri' Synopsis: A tough cop comes to a new village to clean the dirt, but faces a mighty opposition in an evil politician. 'Policegiri' is old wine, in a new bottle. Luckily, the film works, because it entertains at most parts. The First-Hour is engaging & very progressive. The Second-Hour, however, loses pace & the war between the good & bad, gets monotonous. Its never boring, but it doesn't engage as much as the First-Hour does. The Adapted Screenplay offers plenty of action, blood & gore, but lacks sharpness in the Second-Hour. Dialogue will be loved by the masses. K. S. Ravikumar's Direction is over-the-top. Cinematography & Editing are standard. Music by Himesh Reshammiya & Meet Bros Anjjan, is good. Action-Sequences are awesome. Performance-Wise: Sanjay Dutt is in form. He enacts the tough cop effortlessly. His Fans will love him, once again! Prachi Desai gets limited scope. Prakash Raj is the same as he was in Wanted & Singham. There's no novelty as far as his character & performance are concerned. Manoj Joshi is efficient. Rajpal Yadav & Rajat Rawail don't raise many laughs. Mukesh Tiwari, Murli Sharma & Raju Mawani are perfect. Om Puri is adequate.On the whole, 'Policegiri' will work strictly for those who love vintage masala films." 
" Comeback Of Rajpal Yadav. â™¦ 30%","Rajpal Yadav only has a screen time of 5 minutes & he totally pulls it off. His humor and the climax made me laugh my stomach out. And talking about the action, let's just say Singham is remade with slightly different cast & town setup.The movie is pointless in the base when we do have similar story lines all over the Indian cinema industry. Sanjay Dutt looks old although his style statement is still appreciable. The dialogs truly act for the movie but they make you laugh, as well. Prakash Raj reprises his Singham role without any vindictiveness. Prachi Desai is a doll as is any actress in a Bollywood action film. Songs are worthless & induce laughs. Taking a potshot on other famous Bollywood films, actors & dialogs is what the writers have done here. Editing is bizarre.Overall, a failed attempt. Towards the climax, the SFX & stunts by the characters will make you laugh like you're watching some comedy circus. Cars drive by their own, sunglasses defy gravity, bullets destroy daggers and what-not. A 3.0/10 for this experience.BOTTOM LINE: A very promising movie, though which will attract people who like baseless action comedies that do not make sense at all.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: Mild | Violence/Gore: Infinity | Vulgarity: Very Mild | Sex/Foreplay: No; Implied | Smoking: No | Alcohol: Strong | Drugs: No" 
" Faltugiri","There was a time when Sanjay Dutt had a good physique and was the ideal cast for a cop role, or action films something he stopped doing when action films took a backseat and comedies ruled the roost, but ever since Ghajini, Wanted, Rowdy Rathore every star seems to want to do a south remake. Surprising the film is a remake of a Tamil film Saamy released in 2003 which makes it 10 yrs later, in between such films are done to death. There's nothing new in the plot, or anything but it's hard to digest 54 year old Sanjay Dutt with a paunch trying to romance 20+ something Prachi Desai, The film tries hard to cash on sympathy wave regarding Sanju but this is no Khalnayak. The film is so boring it makes you cringe, There are so many more outdated factors in the film, One is the action scenes, it's tiring to watch actors flying in odd directions, After the Influx of South Indian remakes every action film has that style, It's even more boring to see Prakash Raj who has done such roles to death. The last few minutes are unintentionally hilarious and make you cringe al the more.Direction by KS Ravikumar is terrible Music is terribleSanjay Dutt as I said looks misfit in the role, but he does his job well but his paunch and age makes him look out of sorts. Prachi Desai has nothing to do, Prakash Raj is so repetitive he makes you die in boredom, The rest are Mukesh Tiwari, Murli Sharma who have done such roles to death, Om Puri overdoes in a brief role, Rajpal Yadav and Rajat Rawail don't make you laugh" 
" Tamil movie Saamy remade in Hindi","The action was just too over the top and completely unrealistic. Save your money for a better experience. I was just too eager to watch because of Sanjay Dutt and came out feeling that the director and screenplay writer deserved jail time. The director K.S.Ravikumar needs to quit as his time is done. The movie would have been a hit in the 1990s but not for this decade. The story was the same as the Tamil original but the screenplay was slower and certainly did not deliver. If only the action was directed with some sense. If the schedule was tight owing to the lead actor's pending jail term, they should have planned better. In one of the songs, extensive use of the chroma key (green screen) was just too obvious and did not scale the lead pair to the size of the video that they were pasted on. Everything taken into account, the movie would probably bomb due to the unrealistic action sequences, the mediocre directing and outdated screenplay style." 
" Good in some parts but overall crappy !!","Policegiri is same old story of a good cop vs a corrupt politician . But the change is that he's corrupt and uses it as a tool to clean the bad guys. Till here fine but the treatment of the subject is disappointing. Dabangg is a good example of a movie on a corrupt cop. Sanjay Dutt is a bit too old for this role. He has a paunch and his scenes with Prachi Desai are too awkward. Desai is old enough to play his daughter's role. Dutt would have been a good choice to play this role a decade back. Prakash Raj is in full form and is excellent in his role as the villain. He spouts some excellent one liners and brings a smile when he is on screen. The film has too many songs that slow the pace and Dutt's transformation from corrupt cop to an honest one is not shown properly. Equally baffling is Prachi Desai's background story of her marriage. Can't explain. Policegiri could have been a good entertaining film had the script been a bit better." 
" i don't believe sanjay did this movie...","I join the movie after 5 minute it started. And for the whole movie i was cursing myself. i live in tamilnadu. After some days i got this movie from my friend. i watched it from beginning then i realized that movie is originally a remake of Tamil movie "Sammy" in which vikram is the hero. The movie was a block buster in Tamil cinema.But the people in Bollywood needs to understand that the Hindi audience is not gonna like this kind of movies. I never expected from sanjay that he ill do such kind of movie.About movie. Starts with insane action,that never ends in the whole story.. A powerful corrupt politician, a "trying to be honest" high rank police officer, a beautiful girl who has no part in the whole movie. I am not going to tell you about ending, cause now you can easily predict it. My opinion "AVOID THIS MOVIE""
