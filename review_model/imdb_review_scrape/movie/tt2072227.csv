" A challenging and rewarding film experience","Take any of your favorite political thrillers. What you'd find is political insight and compelling suspense, seamlessly woven to demystify your flimsy notions and beliefs about that subject. While the protagonist peels the layers off falsehood, you experience the joy of veils dropping. You get more than just the solution of a mystery; a new interpretation of the event, a shocking perspective. Dibakar Banerjee's Shanghai is one such political thriller. This terrific film hits you like a hurricane and terrifies you to bits. It has an abiding effect that will haunt you even hours after you've left the theater. If you enjoy true cinema, go for SHANGHAI.. Else, better wait for SRK or FARAH KHAN's next POPCORN FLICK!! Go for SHANGHAI for Kalki Koechlin, for Emraam Hashmi,for Abhay Deol, for the Music & for everything you want from a masterpiece! And next time you end up comparing why do Bollywood standards do not reach Hollywood, stay quite! You don't deserve a word!10/10" 
" Brilliant Start to June","Just coming home after watching the movie, and I was really really impressed with... Everything. While coming back, I heard some friends say it was boring and not very good, which made me write this review:Watch It if you are looking for some serious cinema. Definitely Watch It if you have a brain to actually THINK about what the movie is trying to say.I've been disillusioned with Bollywood for some years now, but every year, there come some movies which are absolutely top class, which actually say something rather than throwing undercooked brainless (un)comic crap at us. Shanghai is one of the former, and nearly everything is well done in this movie.The direction is very good and tight, the background score is very apt, the cinematography is fantastic, as is the editing. And although the story is actually not very new, revolving around the general hopelessness we associate with Indian politics and law, the way Dibakar Banerjee presents it, and the (un)happy-ending really makes it shine...I think that the movie may probably not do extremely well in theaters because "most" Indians go for mindless comedies these days, but those who want to see a GOOD movie, This is definitely one for them." 
" Insanely Brilliant !!!!","There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the dialogues, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well pictured and the music is electronically haunting. Never, in the run time of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.The film is hardly one hour-fifty minutes long, and you wish that there was no interval. You don't need one when you are watching a crisp and thrilling film like this one! It's an engaging thriller with a political backdrop, and the performances are mind blowing. Kalki Koechlin is fabulous. Pitobash Tripathy is superb. Abhay Deol has captured the nuisances of the south Indian accent perfectly. He is restrained and strong. But the star of the show is Emraan Hashmi. It might turn out to be too intelligent for Emraan Hashmi fans who generally come to see him smooch his leading lady. So we will have to wait and see if a brilliant film like this is lapped up at the box office or not. Shanghai shocks, engages and makes a powerful statement. Dibakar lives up to the standards he has set for himself." 
" Shanghai is a raw meat marinated with slow poison.","Before I start, let me tell you that I haven't read Vassillis Vasilikov's Z and neither have I seen the Academy Award winning film by Costa-Gavras. Shanghai based on the same book, for me, comes as an original standalone in Hindi cinema by the double time National Award winner Dibakar Bannerjee.Shanghai, is what this fictional town of Bharat Nagar will look like with the flourishing of "International Business Park (IBP)", as promised by the Chief Minister (Supriya Pathak). You can expect it to be any other political scam. Dr. Ahmedi (Prosenjit Chatterjee) who believes this project will degrade the living of the poor, lands here to set his march of opposition. Alongwith Ahmedi, comes a Katrina Kaif caricature Tina. While she is doing Imported Kamariya at the IBP (India Bana Pardes) show, Dr. Ahmedi is slayed to death by a truck. His student, Shalini Sahay (Kalki) is stubborn about the fact that it was not an accident but murder. IAS Officer T. A. Krishnan (Abhay Deol) leads the Enquiry Commission set by the CM. Meanwhile, Jogi Parmar (Emran Hashmi), a pornographer reaches an evidence material of the case.Meeting of every two aforesaid characters is marked with playful scene like entering of a ball in the newly setup office of Krishnan between a heated discussion, or the English conversation of Jogi with Shalini.Leisurely paced, the first half is cooked up with two songs where Bharat Mata Ki Jai is just abrupt, misled and serves no purpose to the story. That's what you wanted Mr. Producer, right? An item song and a peppy track? But what makes the direction extra-ordinary are the detailing with the arts and sound design in almost every scene. Note that sound of a crying baby in the background amidst the tensed situation when Dr. Ahmedi is admitted to the hospital. Whereas the background score in most of the parts is overdone with the same beats.For its running time of 114 minutes, this thriller grips you leisurely with not many scenes that brings you to the edge of your seat but its raw treatment and toning , fine editing and engaging performances. Emran Hashmi stands out of the lot with his best performance of his career. You are never let to believe that you are actually watching the same Hashmi. The most experienced actor Faroque Sheikh draws every attention in his scene. Kalki plays the deepest character of the film with mild tone and louder-than-words silence. Abhay Deol is in the skin of the character of a generous officer with his Tam accent. Pitobash is almost similar as you have seen him in Shor In The City.By the end, things resurface to the top, gets unfold, and many unanswered questions are left to you to think. Dibakar doesn't hammer you with the dark side of the political system but asks many questions. Prominently, Is India really shining? Judge yourself. But Indian Cinema is really shining with this movie at the theaters.Though I don't account Shanghai as DB's best work (for me, it's still L.S.D.), but it is the best political thriller you could ever see." 
" A brilliant subtle political thriller by Banerjee that deserves standing ovation","Some five years ego when I first saw Kosta Gavra's classic political thriller "Z" I thought it has all the ingredients to be made into Indian scenario. Even though the film is five decades old the scenarios fits into contemporary India. It digs into the political machinery and their double standards as they talk about Industrial developments. With land acquisition, truth behind special economic zone (SEZs), red-tapism, bureaucratic machinery all molded in a thriller format had everything going for Indian audience. When Dibakar Banerjee announced Shanghai which is based on the Greek novel "Z' by Vassilis Vasilikos I was thrilled. Banerjee successfully adapted the novel and used it to portray a dark of political India.Set in fictional BharatNagar "Shanghai" starts with Dr Ahmadi , a socialist worker being bumped off as he protest against the land acquisition and warns aam-janata to look into the real motives of the politicians and industrialists. Circumstances brought in Jogi Parmer, a rustic porn film maker who falls for the gori lady and how got himself caught in the web of deceit. It is through the investigation of Ahmedi's murder the journey of unmasking of those in the system begins as we came to know about the truth behind the game of industrialization. Symbolically it reflects the rotten Indian system in a realistic fashion which will shock audience and let them think. With India being claimed as potential future super power of the world the big shots inside the system is robbing her from within at every level leading towards a greater economic divide.Dibakar Banerjee showed immense potential in earlier three films (khosla ka ghosla, oye lucky lucky oye, LSD) and each of them he used ample dose of dark humor to bring out some prevailing problem in the society. He does the same and succeeds in "Shanghai".He has compromised less interns of story telling and kept many scenes subtle enough for further interpretation. His detailing of sequences needs to applaud. Indeed he is one of the finest story teller of the country and together with Anurag Kashyap,Vishal Bhardwaj can elevate the Indian cinema whereby getting appreciation from world audience as something meaningful yet entertaining. Teaming up with Urmi Juvekar, the duo has done a splendid job in keeping the dialogs real, subtle yet catchy. Being a thriller the happenings keep you engaged to the screen. Like Kahaani this is another taut thriller which can compete with any world cinema. Nikos Andritsakis cinematography deserves standing ovation. His usages of occasional shakes, close-ups elevate the screenplay. The sepia tone set it perfect for the rustic India. Namratha Rao's editing is top notch and she proved that Kahaani was just not one flash in the pan. Vandana Kataria's production design is effective and creates the atmosphere for a dark, thrilling ride. Atul Mongia's unique ensemble casting needs recognition. Vishal-Shekhar's music works. "Bharat mata ki jaye" is true satirical song which is helped by some brilliant choreography.Acting wise every single person involved has given a superlative performance. Emraan Hashmi as Jogi Parmer is revelation. He proved his detractors wrong and gave a new life to himself as he joined the league of meaningful cinema. Prior to this his mass films (though huge Hits) didn't get him accolades from all section of society but this film will make people realize his potential. Abhay Deol is a superb actor and as always he is at his subtle paced. He fits into a character like chameleon and together with the choice of films he makes he is there to make some change in Indian cinema. As IAS Krishnan he has given one of his career best roles. Just check the climax when he confronts with Farooq Sheik. The scene is a marvel and deserves standing ovation. Kalki Koechlin succeeds as the disturbed foreign return Indian Shalini. Her relationship with Dr Ahmedi as well as Jogi Parmer has been portrayed sensitively. Bengali superstar Prosenjit Chatterjee excels as socialist worker Dr Ahmedi. The movie surrounds his character and in a comparatively small role he leaves his marks. Pitobash as usual is exceptional. With Shor in the city, I am Kalaam and now Shanghai he will definitely land up in more meaty roles in near future. He is a power house of talent. Veterans Farooq Sheik and Supriya Pathak were always known for their acting potential and here also they lived up to their names. Tilottoma Shome as Mrs Ahemdi fits the bill as well.Overall Shanghai is another powerful cinema which comes out from Bollywood. In a thriller mode it raises very pertinent questions on the way the Indian political system works. The film is dark, real yet entertaining that will keep the audience (though it might not appeal to many cine-goers who loves unreal commercial cinema) engaged till the end. It is another landmark film which is to be experienced, a masterpiece. Indeed it has all the stamps that are associated with a film which has been co-produced by NFDC.P.S : I agree with the first reviewer in IMDb with the statement that one should watch this film "And next time you end up comparing why do Bollywood standards do not reach Hollywood, stay quite! You don't deserve a word!".. Indeed I think Kosta Govra would have been proud to see this adaptation" 
" A Truly Well Made Film Which Belongs To The Director !!","Shanghai is a delight from head to toe. Dibakar Banerjee is without a doubt my favourite bollywood director of recent times. Already it's a hell of a job matching the standards of LSD, Oye Lucky and Khosla still he manages to pull off a gritty tale with such panache which compels me to compare him with the Hollywood great Quentin Tarantino. The city of Bharat Nagar is about to have a turn of fate as the ruling government tries to convert it into an infrastructure marvel but then there's a proclaimed personnel and social activist Aahmedi played by Bengal's very own Prosenjit Chatterjee. But the ruling party has other plans for him as he is brutally injured in a hit and run case which leaves Shalini(Kalki Koechlin) to fight it out to the find the truth behind the proclaimed accident. Imran Hashmi plays Joginder Parmar who's a videographer come pornographer who has some evidence that might help things fall into place for Aahmedi. The real kick comes when Krishnan(Abhay Deol) in given the responsibility to find out the truth. What works for Shanghai is that even though so much is going around all the time there is this definite attention given to each and every detail that you are just kept glued to the screen. Plus there is the fine twist in the end as well. The scenes without any background score, a Dibakar Banerjee trend I suppose, the gritty yet amicable screenplay everything is I personally love. You actually can feel through the scenes as they pass.The performances are exceptional be it Abhay Deol, Kalki or even Hashmi as he steps inside shoes which one would never consider to fit him. But then that's the sheer genius of Dibakar Banerjee. Still though call me greedy I expected a little tiny bit more drama. But then nothing is perfect. After 'Kahaani' it is in my opinion the second best movie I have set my eyes upon in 2012. Take A Bow Mr.Director!" 
" Tarantino, step aside; we have DB!","Dibakar Banerjee, Abhay Deol and Emraan Hashmi. There cannot be any better reason to watch this movie and well, it's worth the expectations. Shanghai, the Desi adaption of Z by Vassilis Vassilikos is a fine thriller.First things first, you can feel the Dibakar Banerjee style in each and every frame of this around two hour movie. In first ten minutes itself, the culprits are revealed and there is no whodunit feeling in first half, but thanks to brilliantly panned screenplay (courtesy Urmi Juvekar and DB), the tension builds on in a continuum till the climax and climax pays it off.The power of Shanghai lies in its characters and subplots. Director leaves much upon the imagination of viewers but, still it is amazing to witness such a powerful cinema with a short and simple story. Abhay, Emraan and Kalki play their milestone characters and they play with such an ease that it is impossible to picture any actors in their shoes. Prosenjit Chatterjee, though plays a cameo, makes his presence felt throughout the movie, which is incredible.Shanghai could have been a loud political thriller with grungy background score and over the top acting, but DB chooses the path less traveled. Like his last three films he chooses his own subtle and proportionately dramatic storytelling that makes it a standalone from clichéd and crass political thrillers. In order to keep the intensity of such a mature subject, Dibakar has deliberately avoided soulful songs like Khudaya and Dua, and placed situational tracks like Bharat Mata Ki and Imported Kamariya, which is a courageous effort.The negatives? First half takes a bit more of time to create the situations and subplots making the movie a bit drag occasionally. Apart from this, I can't find out any other loopholes in this movie.Watch it or not? If you are a fan of "the real powerful cinema", do go for it." 
" Don't expect masses to like this art","When me and two of my closest friends, me and one of my bros were quite skeptical after reading the trashy review the people are giving on the social networking sites,but had it not been for my other bro, we were inches away from missing probably one of the best Indian cinema made in the last decade. Taking a detour from every clichés of Indian political cinema, rather Indian cinema , This movie has no melodramatic dialogue, no over the top meaningless item number( imported kamariya does have an importance in the story, not just an added novelty and is presented in a way that we do not get distracted from the movie), no sad songs ( though i would have liked the inclusion of the song Duaa) and the biggest of them all, no ENTERTAINMENT. if you want to watch this on a Sunday evening with the family for entertainment, just forget it. if you want gritty realistic , will make you think type of cinema, your best bet. Good direction , wobbly camera-work, very less makeup , good script, even better execution, and the nest acting by the three leads in a long time. If you want to be ignorant or want a movie just to let you release mind's pressure, don't come and watch this. cause, Cinema is eventually an art form to let the reality be known in a merge with over the top neo surrealistic situations. and Shanghai completes the first part in excellence" 
" Decent follow up is with "Z"","I really enjoyed watching this latest Political thrillers like the west since our cinema mostly aims at only entertainment as an escape from the real life. The acting is great, the storyline is well written with adequate character development to let you get emotionally invested. The film is based on Greek writer Vassilis Vassilikos' political novel "Z" on which director Costa-Gavras also made his project titled "Z" (French) in 1969, which means "He is Alive" in a symbolic form. But SHANGHAI actually scores much higher than all the earlier political thrillers made in the country mainly due to its subtle and calm treatment of an intense plot which keeps you engrossed especially in its second half.Emraan Hashmi has shown real talent that he is much more capable of apart from smooching leading lady. If you love true cinema, go for SHANGHAI." 
" It will compel you to question that Where is our country heading All thanks to Corrupt Politicians but Still Bharat Mata Ki Jai Bolo.","No adjective to describe Shanghai.But i Will still try an 'Adjective' to describe it.Awesome Daunting Jittering Enigmatic Charming Terrific Intelligent Vivid Energetic is the Adjective i will use to describe it. The yardstick of watching a film is different for different people.There are some people who watch films merely for Entertainment and then there are some people who watch it to get knowledge,Awareness and for learning something new.You will like Shanghai even if your yardstick is former or later, its meant for both masses and classes.Just bit complex so masses (People who watches Films for entertainment) need to keep more attention on the screen to understand it better.You will definitely Learn many things after you watch the Movie Like- 1] How MNC's and corporates tie up with the government for getting acres of land where poor and middle class people stays to build their new institution,malls and Profit making infrastructure and how government fools the public that its a 'Development Project' for welfare of the country 2] How does scam happens in negotiation of making a tender for passing a contract 3] How does government manipulates and kills all the evidences that can bring them down etc. You may feel that you have seen all this before but the Execution by Dibakar banerjee is so intriguing and contemporary that you will get hooked to the film and will be on edge of the seat. Hats off to Dibakar banerjee for making such a awesome Political thriller which compels you to question that where is our country heading and you feel flabbergasted, shocked and also feel indignation at the corrupt state of affairs of the country. Frankly, i went to watch the film because of Emraan hashmi but came out praising Abhay deol more, he really acts very well and you can see it in his eyes. As for Emraan hashmi, he is not bad, in fact he breaks all the stereotypes attached with him with Shanghai and shows his detractors and critics that he can act really well without foreign locations and urban clothes too.I am sure he will get all the 'Best Supporting Actor' award next year but since Dibakar banerjee is best friends with Abhay deol he gave more substantial and impressive role to Abhay. In comparison of Abhay, Emraan has bit small role but he still impresses audience and shines in the role. Kalki is repetitive but is overall okayish and looks cute and charming. Prosenjit chatterjee has a small role, sort of cameo and he excels. Faruque shaikh is superlative. Rest of the cast is perfect for their respective roles.2 songs of the film 'Bharat mata ki Jai' and 'Morcha' are catchy and will be a rage and anthem in coming days.Background music is good too.Cinematography is top-notch and have captured the nuances and sepia-tone of small town perfectly. The writing is fantastic, though it is Inspired by 'Z' a 1969 novel but the writers have changed many important and substantial things to fit in contemporary India of 2012 for example they have changed the entire second half and have written original story for second half.The camera angles are in accordance with what the scene demands. I would not like to give away any minute details of plot and story, because it will spoil your fun and you will get the link so better you watch it and experience it yourself. Sorry if you were looking for the the plot, go to the next review. Finally, with the running time of 1 Hour 50 mins i.e 110 Minutes this film is a well edited and crisp thriller which everyone should watch and should'NT miss if they care to see what is happening with our country and how the corrupt politicians are having the last laugh by fooling innocent people. Do watch it. Bharat mata ki Jai" 
" A political thriller told in a simple earthy manner. Chilling.",""Until and unless you step out of your comfort zone and try something new, no new grounds will be broken, no new films will be launched, no new stars will be discovered, people won't get to see new stories and our industry will not be injected with new blood," director Dibakar Banerjee recently said.With his latest film – "Shanghai," a political thriller - he appears to be staying true to his words.With "Shanghai," which releases today, Mr. Banerjee takes an offbeat look at the drama of coalition politics and bureaucracy in India, featuring actors Abhay Deol, Emraan Hashmi and Kalki Koechlin in lead roles.Set in a fictional city called Bharatnagar –set to become the "next Shanghai" as a redevelopment project kicks off – the film starts off with the murder of a social activist who had been opposing the project. The film is an adaptation of Greek novel "Z" by writer Vassilis Vassilikos.A high-ranking bureaucrat, played by Mr. Deol, is put in charge of the investigation and a local videographer, interpreted by Mr. Hashmi, claims to have key evidence to resolve the case.Mr. Banerjee has for long been synonymous with films that tackle big issues without being  overly preachy. There's the 2006 comedy drama "Khosla Ka Ghosla," about one family's struggle to get their land back from a property shark, or the well-crafted black comedy about a super thief in his 2008 film "Oye Lucky Lucky Oye."  Then, with his 2010 film "Love Sex Aur Dhokha" –shot entirely on a digicam – he turned to the subject of voyeurism, honor killings and sting operations." 
" "Great novel, Great Display."","We have another great film from Dibakar Banerjee. He sure knows the importance of a story in a film. Khosla ka ghosla is still my favorite story. And now he has come up with a political thriller, though based on the acclaimed novel. The beauty of the film definitely lies in its awesome story, but there are other things too, to focus upon. The story revolves around a construction project which step by step unearthed the evil plans for its erection. This is one of the few Bollywood films, you ought to watch.PROS:The acting by almost all the cast was above average. Abhay deol looked too good as the IAS officer. Imraan haashmi has done a fine job, at least after the image that he has. The art direction definitely needs to be applauded. The locations were apt and the general look and feel was scary and dark at appropriate instances. The sound too was good. Some of the major characters were very nicely developed and analyzed. You are entirely into the film after just 10 minutes.CONS:When the film finished I really had the feeling that it wound up quickly. I felt that the second half should have been explored a bit more. There might have been a possibility of around 20 minutes more of the film. In the end everything seemed to happen so quickly that your mind is entirely on the details, but when you suddenly know that the film is going to finish, you want more to be shown on the screen.MESSAGE: "You cannot always escape."VERDICT: "A must watch."" 
" Courage goes all the way+Every pause tells a story","Why did I go for this movie? One man-Dibakar Bannerjee. After khosla ka ghosla, he strikes again exposing a grim reality we love to avoid.The Us Vs them/ legitimate vs Traitor theme is always on in India and will continue to be...!!Composure of actors/interlinking of themes/ exposure of India's rowdies on streets and their utter shamelessness after committing crimes with elan!!! The mind games,the subtle selfishness, the frustration...left so many things for our imagination.Dibakar: Hats off, you make us proud..As Gurudev Tagore said: Many wonders how god in the process of producing 100 Million Bengolies, produce A MAN!" 
" Shanghai and Z: Remaking of a classic after 40 years !!!","I watched "Shanghai" yesterday and it is a decent Indianized adaptation of "Z" by Costa Gavraswhich had far reaching consequences in the real world. You can read the real life implications in my other review of the classic itself.Good acting from Deol and Emraan Haashmi carried the movie all over. There were some dramatics hrown in for Indianing the story but that goes with our taste and spirit. Same for a couple of songs and an Item number, to make it commercially viable.Mr Banerjee adapting from the Costa Gavras movie after 40 long years probably proves once again that a classic is "timeless". It is good that he did pay homage to the original during the name casting which some very well known directors sometimes miss so sorely ; example SLB when he made "Black" from "The Miracle".." 
" A Level Up : For Bollywood and Banerjee!","Shanghai is a level up for Dibaker Banerjee as well as Indian Cinema for so many reasons:1. I don't remember if there has ever been a director after Kundan Shah(Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron) who has braved a quality satire on Indian socio-political system.2. Shanghai shows nothing more than what you already know but still keeps you engrossed because the intensity never dies down.3. It is full of instances where ironical moments have been juxtaposed in the time line and that definitely is one of the core strengths of the movie. 4. Another facet of Abhay Deol is unveiled in Shanghai.He perfectly portrays the characters without overdoing the accent which even a seasoned actor could have ended up with.5. Emran Hashmi never lacked talent but Banerjee's Shanghai provides him of the right opportunity and Hasmi makes full of it by delivering a career defining performance.6. Kalki is her usual best displaying plethora of emotions with aplomb ease.7. The research done to show how the government machinery works is worthy of praise considering how most other movie makers don't even care to research.8. Above all these what makes this movie a grand success is the stupendous casting of all the secondary characters.Kudos!" 
" Engaging Script, Earnest Performances and Some Hollywoodesque Panache","Not very often do mainstream Indian film directors fully channel their vision onto screen; the true potential gets vaporized in an attempt to please the audiences. Also coming in the way is the director's self indulgence, profoundly seen in Ram Gopal Varma's recent ventures, rendering a discordant and utterly baffling soup. Case in point the unbelievable, WTF ending in Sarkar Raj 2 that implicated almost half the cast as baddies (in the third installment, maybe even gardeners and fisher-women may be working for some international drug cartel). What most directors lack is a balance, yes, Indian movies are known worldwide for their colors but let those colors be bright, not gaudy. A majority of them cannot create believable characters or a plot and showcase it on the screen, and I'm just talking films – if I start blasting Indian television soaps, it would probably make up an entire book!This bastardizing of Indian films either to make money or ape foreign movies had caused me to take a break from Bollywood. I didn't even buy Vidya Balan's Kahaani, which seemed to be an Eat, Pray Love with Bidya (It's Vidya btw) one moment and a claustrophobic femme fatale action movie the next. Never overemphasize mundane sequences in an action film, let them stay primly in the background. Four scores and seven years later or, maybe a month or two later, I saw myself sitting comfortably, with no popcorn in my hand and a bunch of immature boys below my row, in a PVR theater in Baroda, waiting for Shanghai to start. The attendance seemed very poor, but it was a respite for me – a better air-conditioner effect! The title of Shanghai seemed to cover almost the entire screen, already pumped up to make a statement (Jaago Grahak Jaago Re like) and the names of the cast and crew followed, some familiar, some not very. And then began the movie. The first shot is a bird's eye view of a city, which looks poles apart from Shanghai and seems more like Mumbai (the film is shot in Maharashtra). The next is a close up shot of a hairy, messy Bhagu as he talks about mutton. The short, pint-sized man then proceeds to assault a shop-owner with his reluctant partner Jaggu. The opening scene itself sets the tone for the rest of the film – we are in for plenty of close-ups, some impressive camera effects such as slow motion, dim and grim lighting, succinct and clever dialogues, dark humor and believable characters.The movie discusses a familiar concept: Bharat Nagar, a fictional city, is flourishing with new infrastructure projects backed by IBP, the ruling political party headed by Madamji (played wisely with demure restraint by Supriya Pathak). But we already see how demagogically the party runs by using common men as pawns. Only Dr. Ahmedi (Prasenjit Chatterjee), a dissident social worker raises his voice and comes to India to forewarn people about the trickery of IBP – he believes the poor are being deceived regarding their relocation. His campaign in Bharat Nagar is supported by his one-time student Shalini Sahay (earnestly played by Kalki Koechlin) who left the States after having an illicit romance with the married man. After the speech, when Ahmedi sternly rebukes the police for not maintaining enough protection, he is hit by a truck all of a sudden. This event is filmed by a videographer/pornographer Joginder Parmar (diligently portrayed by Emraan Hashmi, who also developed some peculiarities for his slightly obnoxious character), who also covers interviews by IBP and such. In the fracas, Joginder and Kalki's lives intertwine when the former's friend has some evidence of foul play in the event. Also working on the case is a studious, no-nonsense bureaucrat T.A Krishnan who strives to collect new evidence but finds (i) a pudgy, gluttonous politician Kaul (a scrumptious performance by Farooq Sheikh) who pressurizes him to close the case immediately and (ii) obdurate police officers who are scared to tell the truth.One glance at the poster of the film, I never would've imagined this was a political thriller; the poster is very misleading and makes this seem like a typical murder mystery with a detective in the form of Abhay Deol. Alter that, please. The movie is a smart political thriller that proceeds in 'City of God' style and has traces of Tarantino and Hitchcock in the sense that its various disparate characters gradually come closer as the climax approaches. The performance by everyone is understated and this is partly because the script deals cogently with action, dialogues, location and effects. Never does it get too artsy or too clever or too frenetic. The characters aren't shown completing one task throughout the film and there are scenes which give them depth; for example, the dangerous Bhagu is insulted by his English teacher, which could be a stimulant for his violence. I heard an interview where Dibakar Banerjee said 'we shouldn't bring in Dr. Ahmedi's infidelity as a shortcoming of his political agenda' because both the matters aren't closely related. Such details are what make characters leap alive, and we don't get dead flowers like the ones in Ra.one.The award season should be teeming with Shanghai's cast, all for best supporting roles: Deol, Hashmi, Sheikh, Chaterjee, Koechlin, Tillomala Shome (in a short yet memorable performance as Dr. Ahmedi's wife), Pathak and even Tripathy. I hope some, especially Deol and Hashmi, do get some recognition. The writing, cinematography, music should strike some gold (or bronze or whatever metal they use to make the lady). The best film, I'm slightly unsure because Shanghai is a one-time watch; as some critics rightly pointed, there could've been more. The movie has made a statement successfully but it's lacking background. But I also feel it's been some time since I was so invested in a Bollywood film. The Indian mainstream cinema needs a change, and movies like Shanghai should make some difference. My Rating:7.6/10"
