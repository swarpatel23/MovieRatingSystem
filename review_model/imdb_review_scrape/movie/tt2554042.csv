" Simple but Striking","Not meant for those who believe in fast and furious glitz and blitz. Here, you have simplicity. Something simple yet startling. What hang backs is the sensation of being spellbound, shaken, shocked and thrilled by this mind-blowing piece of story-telling by director Jaideep Chopra. Great performances indeed. Loved the very start. The duo Pankaj Tripathi and Manav Kaushik, the crooks scare you to death. Sumeet, the main protagonist is superb. Ayub as always leaves a mark. Performances and cinematography are impressive and so is the story-telling. Nowhere does the film slow down or lose momentum. In spite of no big names associated with it, it manages to hold your attention till the end. Not to be missed. Unfortunately, it is not available on DVD." 
" Pathetic Movie","Don't waste your money or time on the movie. The director has tried too hard to make a thriller but the movie loses grip and gets boring and the story is too predictable. The main lead (sumit Nijhawan) should first learn acting before trying into movies. He has no expression and his dialogue delivery is very poor. The actress (Mona Wasu) looks old and should try doing grandmother roles instead of lead actress. This movie should be listed in Comedy category because you won't be able to stop laughing noticing the poor camera work, direction, acting and the poor story. This can easily qualify for the worst movie ever title. Pls. do yourself a favor by not watching this movie and torturing your mind, instead try sleeping that will be healthy and relaxing for your mind." 
" Pathetic yuck","Cant understand who made this movie and invested in this. An awful watch. Complete waste of money. The lead actor is really bad and doesn't know how to "act". Surprised and shocked that such a movie found producers who were ready to invest in this. Complete shame for producers and total cast and crew. Please do NOT watch. I would recommend that people catch up on their on sleep rather than wasting time and money on this movie. Poor direction and locations. Moreover the plot loses steam and confuses that what is the direction of the story line. Bad selection of songs and music is OK OK. With a better story and effort on good direction this could have turned into something watchable. I was surprised by a high rating for this movie on IMDb. Looks like it has be rated by the crew of the movie rather than watchers. A complete bad job at thriller category. Could qualify for a amateur movie (that too comedy) made by people who lost track in middle of movie."
