" Flop","N Chandra who made hits like 1986 blockbuster Ankush also in the early 90's made his biggest crap. Narsimha was a flop and this was Deol and Chandra's only movie together. Anyways, Narsimha has an interesting start, the settle of problems, the tension of poor people is well shown. Even the intro of Narsimha is well shown until a point where there is only overacting and the way Baapji(Om Puri) delivers his dialogues is stupid. But, Sunny Deol in his bad movies also acts well and even heroines do the same. Dimple Kapadia is really good in this movie and shines with Sunny Deol always. But, the script is so weak and the direction is bottom class which makes our actors acting down. But, the action is still good. I don't have anything against violence but honestly this movie was violent. The way they scared the mom with a dead bird was violent. Also the ending where the clock arm stabs Baapji is retarted and truly violent. The biggest mistake is the use of violence. N Chandra is famous for violence as shown in Ankush which was still good. But, this movie crosses the limit making it bad. Acting is top class, action is average(violence is not good always), songs are bad, editing is just again average but not as bad as Shankara which was Sunny's second crap in 1991 after Yodha which was also crap. Overall, another average movie which flops and nowadays public will never watch this movie." 
" Lion roars biceps flex","Bap ji fed and took care of Narashimah, Bap Ji is the king of the whole city !nothing and no one can do anything without the consent of Bap Ji . Narasimah carries all tasks good or evil whatever they are Bap Ji commands him and he does them no questions asked. But things are about to change for the tyrant king, as he has forgotten who the real king is .The real king of the city has been away for a long time, hes been asleep for 4 years. But hes, returning to take back whats rightfully his, the city and all those who inhabit it. Just as Bap Ji represents the eagle and has its, statues, all over his mansion Narasimah is the lion with a mane and has it tattooed on his bicep ,after every good action we see the lion on his bicep roar a kind of roar of victory. The 2 standout scenes are, the first confrontation between Bap Ji and Narashimah a powerful scene because up until now no ones, even dared to look in to the eyes of Bap Ji let alone scream back at him.The best standout scene is were Narasimah chained like Samson to two pillars in Bap Jis, mansion . When Bap Ji finally reveals that it was he who caused the deaths of Narashimas family as well as thousands of other city dwellers , the scene has to seen to be believed, not only Narasimahs biceps bulge but his eyes bulge out as he goes ballistick with rage " HATHYAREY ,KHOONI MAIN TUJEY MAR DALU GA" Did i mention he has a denim jacket with a picture of a Tiger on the back"
