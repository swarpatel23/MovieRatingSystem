" Middle age syndrome.","Kucch Love Jaissa is a woman oriented film where a middle aged home keeper ( Shefaali Shah as Madhu Saxena ) longs for a change and space in her daily monotonous life. Her's is an upper middle class family consisting of a decent and understanding husband ( Sumeet Raghavan,an ad agency executive ) and two adorable school going kids.What else can a spouse/ mother long for ?. She enjoys all goodies of life.Now the first twist comes. For some unexplained reasons  ( perhaps she has to manage the daily chores by her self or /and ,having been neglected in the decision making sphere ) she  ( after seeing off her kids to school and the husband to office) leaves her home for an unannounced outing ,a kind of an escapade. The immediate she does is to buy   a brand new car on her husband's credit card.To kill time she window shops  at a multiplex and there after walks into a restaurant for a bite.It's here that the second twist comes.  She meets a mysterious character ( Rahul Bose as Raghav).Who is he ?His mannerisms ,the rugged looks and  the way of eating food puzzles her.Any way,tele pathy makes her believe in this stranger.As directed, she moves along  with this  stranger in her car to places never visited earlier.Here the movie becomes a roadie in a metro. The third twist comes in the climax. The reality of the stranger is revealed  ( he turns out to be an outlaw on the run ) . Also,the day being her birthday,makes her return home. The pluses  of KLJ - Shefaali Shah is outstanding in her full fledged role as the lady in the  pink on the move ( the pink dress suits her to the T ).She has a towering screen presence.Young girls entering films have a lot to learn from the acting abilities of Shefaali Didi/ auntie. Rahul Bose conveys a lot with his mono -syllables way of conversation.The casting   is apt.Performances are good. Barnali Ray Shukla ,is a writer/ director with a promise.Shefali Shah ,the mother,is assured that her school going daughter would not get a-strayed in a relationship with a boy ( surprisingly the daughter is well versed with sensitive issues of  sex and love at her tender age ). The one sided conversations on the cell add to the narrative. The minuses of KLJ -The characterization of Rahul Bose is sketchy and unclear.Is Shefaali Shah so naive as to accompany a stranger throughout the day unmindful of her kids coming back from school? Film after film it's being noticed that the new breed of singers are unable to hold their breath in the ending notes.Music directors must make a note of this.Neetu Chandra,otherwise a good actress,continues to be type cast as the gangster's mole film after film.Om Puri is wasted in a parental role.Makrand Deshpande hardly gets noticed in his cameo of the telephone booth owner. All in all,KLJ is a different kind of a film that could be enjoyed by the middle age viewers" 
" It seems that few films are just made to show some expenses or losses in the books.","Seeing the First Look trailer of this film a few weeks before, I thought it might be a small gem featuring Rahul Bose in a similar kind of role as he had earlier done in CHAMELI and MR & MRS IYER. The film looked like made on the identical plot of Rahul meeting a completely stranger girl one fine day and they spending few hours together with her as a new experience of his life.Perhaps Rahul may also have realized the resemblance in the story plot himself while reading the script. But still for reasons unknown he said yes to it and therefore, here he is once again meeting an unknown attractive married woman, who has just decided to be herself for one whole day forgetting all about her husband and children. (For the records he earlier met a prostitute one night in CHAMELI and later had met a South Indian Brahmin married women travelling with her child in a bus in MR & MRS IYER.)But contrary to all my minimal expectations, the film turned out to be pretty bad, which doesn't even deserve to be compared with the gem called MR & MRS IYER. In fact it's even far inferior than the dud CHAMELI too and can be simply included in the list of worst movies released this year. With a reputed off-beat cinema favourite, Rahul Bose paired against the competent Shifaali, KUCCH LUV JAISA could have been at least a fairly enjoyable ride for the audience. But unfortunately the film becomes quite bore and uninteresting right from the moment the two actors meet each other on the screen.In other words, after the few initial good scenes indicating towards the 'Seven Year Itch' in the family, the script looks like completely outdated and un-happening in the literal sense. It is neither an entertaining thriller moving with a fast pace nor an enlightening one making you aware of your inner being. It neither gives you any enjoyable performance to compensate for its boring content (Rahul & Shifaali), nor does it offer any soothing music or songs to cool you off (Pritam). The director Barnali Ray Shukla has made the film as if it was a School Project of a student to be essentially completed and presented in front of the teacher in the given time frame.Hence after watching it, I had only one thought in my mind that what could have been the purpose of making this film in such an irresponsible manner. There is so much effort, pain and hard work needed from so many people to make a project reach the screen, then why such kind of Sure Flop film was planned by the production house so confidently. But then suddenly I remembered the name of its producer Vipul Shah, (also husband of Shifaali) who has earlier produced huge hits such as SINGH IS KINNG, NAMASTE London and more. So as a conclusion, either this film was made to satisfy the inner urge of Shifaali or it was made to show some extra expenses or losses in the account books as per the normal business procedure of a Big Production house. In any case the victim once again remains the poor viewer."
