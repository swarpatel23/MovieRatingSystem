" Fifty-Fifty","If only I had had the good sense to turn of the DVD after the intermission. Because the first half of Out of Control is pretty good. The story is very simple. MILD SPOILER Indian boy goes to find his fortune in America. The twist comes when there he falls in love with a gori 'exotic' dancer and singer. In India his proud father however has found him a nice Indian ladki. What makes this first half entertaining is its humor, the fact that tradition is thrown into the wind and the fact that you can relate to the actors.The second half is the exact opposite because the makers of this movie didn't have the courage to follow through with the story. As a result all of the characters start acting out of character and in stead of loving them we start intensely disliking them. The only constant factor is Amrish Puri who sticks to his role like a stamp to a letter.Watch this at your own peril!**/5 stars" 
" RITESH , RODERICK AND HRISHITA STEAL THE SHOW","THE FILM is about an Indian man named Jaswinder aka Jimmy(Ritesh) in US who marries a lady named Sally(Roderick) for settling immigration problem.When he reaches India,his father forces him to marry a girl Richa(Hrishita).Jimmy struggles with life and tries to manage both his wives with help of his friend Mango(Satish Kaushik).In this way,comical situations arise.Jimmy loves both of them and cannot tell truth because he is afraid of the consequences.
Ritesh is as usual cute and perfect in playing his character.His expressions and timing show that he had really got into the skin of the character.Message of the film as well as the story is great and unique.At the end,Jimmy and Richa(who was pregnant)unite while Sally withdraws case against Jimmy.A line spoken by her when Richa stands by Jimmy is remarkable,''IF AN INDIAN WIFE CAN STAND BY HER HUSBAND THEN WHY CAN'T AN AMERICAN WIFE''.
Cinematography and the songs are equally nice and charming.
Watch it.YOU WILL LOVE IT" 
" Cashing in on Brande's body","This is a lame crossover movie.  The first half-1 hour is so bad, it's funny.  Brande is speaking "tuti-puthi," awfully disjointed Hindi.  You start asking questions like, "What the heck?" after watching scenes like the "Gaon Ki Gori" scene.  Brande is attractive though and gives some visual entertainment for half the audience.  She concentrates too much on speaking Hindi, but when its English, she acts well.  The Haasil actress performs surprisingly well.  Songs are good except for "Tu Mera Pyaar Bhi Hai." The best part of the flick is the comic relief (if you haven't gotten enough from Brande's Hindi) of Mango and the cross-dresser." 
" Brande Roderick steals the movie. Cant get enough of it!!","Out of Control is a great romantic comedy!!! The cast is great!!! Ritesh Deshmuhk's character is off the wall funny trying to balance out 2 marriages, one in America which he's married to Brande Roderick(Sally), and the other in India. For me Brande Roderick steals the spotlight with her character as Sally, a struggling lounge singer who later makes it with a little advice from Jimmy(Ritesh). Her style and charm is what makes this movie great. The way she speaks her Hindi dialouges are cute and amazing. MY GOD she looks HOTT throughout the movies song and dance sequences. Hopefully we see Brande Roderick in other Hollywood and Bollywood roles in the near future!!"
