" Low Budget","I watched this movie because I generally enjoy horror films. This particular movie is about a house haunted by 3 girls who committed suicide as their father was a lazy drunk who owed money to some gangsters, who in turn wanted his daughters as payback. Now some years later a family consisting of a mother father & son move to this house and disrupt the setting of the dead girls room. And the horror starts. This is a low budget film with actors who cannot act, the lead actress is from London but her accent is from mars. All throughout the movie she is wearing skimpy clothes, that too in India. The actor apparently does not own a full sleeves t-shirt. If you want to kill time this movie should be avoided. Unless you want to watch along with your friends and laugh at all the silliness. My verdict 2/10.Â " 
" The Surprise Bollywood Horror of 2010.","How many people have watched Swaha? Did it earn commercial success? I think it deserves to be at least a hit because the movie is a much better horror product than many Bollywood has churned out.The plot is well thought out and due focus given to each character. I was pleasantly surprised to see substance in almost all roles in the movie, right from the hero, heroine, the parents, the swamiji to even the drivers and the servant of the house. The entire movie is filled with relatively unknown actors except Rajesh Vivek(of Lagaan fame) but all of 'em do a fine job. Unlike hyped movies like Phoonk 2 from RGV's factory & others that believe in lot of gory bloodshed & violence to create fear, the low-budget Swaha has none of it and still induces creeps. There's a lesson to learn here.But Swaha has it's negative side too, mainly the acting of the lead actors. Newcomers & lovers in the movie, Rikkee and foreign actor Svitlana are as good as wood in their performances. Besides that, maybe the final confrontation between the ghost hunter Rajesh Vivek & the spirits could have been dealt differently or better.Verdict: Swaha is a solid surprise. No big shakes but not a crap either."
