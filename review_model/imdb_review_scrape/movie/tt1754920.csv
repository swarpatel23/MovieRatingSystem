" Awesome","Another gr8 flick by Sudhir Mishra. The movie has every thing for which any audience can look for. Cast is amazing, Acting is superb and direction is awesome . This movie can be learning for the other directors that how to make comedy without being ridiculous.The plot is gripping throughout the movie except initial context/character building is bit lengthy.The use of flashback is very innovative it will make u to appreciate the artistry the director used.Uses of dialects are superb. YSZ is a testimony of Mishra's craftsmanship as a writer and director. With its many unpredictable twists and twirls and a climax that some might take with a pinch of salt, This movie is a delightfully different film that attempts to break all set formulas and leave you with a smile on the face in the end.Worth watching." 
" Roller coaster","Its coming to it!!!! Finally a crime comedy watch worthy... I am going to rate it right in the class of any Guy Ritchie movie... Sudhir Mishra has been making movies for some time now... but i never expected that he will pull a rabbit out of his hat!!! And this one is some fast rabbit!! it keeps on running turning whenever wherever it wants... And the Narration... too good...!! Its hard to concentrate as there are so many characters and so many protagonists...but with the help of some unbelievable editing he has masterfully connected all of them... Dialogues.. No one but Manu Rishi can do it...!! " O Bhaisaab!!! ye to udta hua teer gaand me le liya aapne!!!! crazy, funny, hilarious.. I was lucky that in my show most of the audience were young and males... and it was a rave in the movie hall!!! claps, whistles, cheers...everything!!! This movie is awessssome!!!" 
" Realistic","Superb movie, far better the SRK's love Fictions, having no base and all non realistic, irrelevant Bakwas. its adult movie but lot to learn from it. Actual words used which we hear in normal life, with Irfan khan at his best. Sudhir Mishra's Yeh Saali Zindagi initially made waves for its cast, then its slightly derogative title and lastly its 22 kisses. As the director fought tooth and nail for each of the above issues, he eventually managed to wriggle of them. Chitrangda Singh looks and plays the part exceedingly well. On screen she brings life to her role with her fiery attitude and feisty persona. Now only if the industry would utilize her more! Arunodhay Singh displays immense talent and shows much promise. The rest of the cast provides great support too." 
" Ye saali film","FILM REVIEW: YEH SAALI ZINDAGI (2011)It is a refreshing, quirky, roller coaster ride, a hilarious take on life, loaded with crime, deceit and wry, black humor. It does not offer anything very new yet the best that 2011 has offered so far.It falls under the same genre as film "Kaminey", but is made on a modest budget. It is colorful, wild and wicked with songs used in an innovative way that does not distract story telling. Cinematography is good. editing is crisp. First half an hour of the film baffles you. But once the film gets its groove it moves at a slick pace. All Actors are perfectly cast but above all it is writer director Sudhir Mishra's film who is again in his best form." 
" Thumbs Up For Sudhir Mishra!!","'Yeh Saali Zindagi' is a restless satire of the underskirts of Delhi,full of dilemma and heart With entertaining narration.Irfan Khan shows his acting skills once again by effortlessly portraying the emotions and confusions of a witty(at the same time heard-hearted) man with oceanly passion for a girl,whom he consider the women of his life.Aditi Rao Hydari (of Delhi 6 fame)introduces us to her sensual and womanly side in this dark movie and is brilliant and eye-catching.Arunodoy Singh as a tough,but cool and love-making man showers the taste of aspirations and wrong calculations.Chitrangda Singh excels as a fighting temptation and is full of feminine energy.Director Sudhir Mishra explores the not-so-smooth side of the north,their culture and enties love n crime into a single entity.Film uses a lot of profane language and swear words and has about 7 steamy scenes;the reason the film being rated 'A'.Music by Nishat khan(a well renowned sitar player) is quite good and mast.The songs like Dil Dar-Ba-Dar n Ishq Tere Jalwe is quite soothing to the rustic darkness of the movie.Verdict:In a whole the film will keep you entertained and will reveal the darker side of this life as in previous films of t director,in a darker way. So, Check out this movie and get entertained.Ma rating:8.5/10" 
" Sudhir Mishra is having fun","When I watch gangster capers like Yeh Saali Zindagi, I am never quite sure how to go about reviewing the movie without giving away the essence of it. Because none of these movies have much of a story in the traditional sense. But they make up for the lack of a depth with their movie-making style – and packing the script with quirky characters Which Yeh Saali Zindagi has by bucketloads. Beginning with Irrfan Khan, a crooked account par excellence who helps arms dealers, politicians and other unsavoury characters stash away their moolah. He might be exceedingly clever in the ways of the world, but the wiles of women are completely beyond him, as he discovers, hanging from his 30th floor balcony in the opening scene of the movie. Holding the end of the rope is his boss, Saurabh Shukla – who doesn't think much of the womankind and their wily ways – and nor does he care about his promises to his employees.The opening scene of the movie might be a bit of a shock to some – given the coarse and vulgar language in it. Sudhir Misra's writing and editing is crisp – so you have to follow the movie carefully to understand the twists and turns of the script. Those squeamish about vulgar Hindi words are better off not watching the movie – and those with weak Hindi should probably brush up their abuses. Because the dialogues in Yeh Saali Zindagi are really profane – and all the fun is lost if you don't understand the dirty jokes – of which there are plenty The humour is irreverent (and of course very rustic). Death and violence are casually treated, and the background narration by Irrfan adds dry deadpan humour to the proceedings. There are mandatory backstories for most characters – and jumps between them quite abrupt – hence requires full concentration.Essentially there are two stories running in parallel in the movie – Irrfan & Chitrangada's love track and Arunoday & Aditi Rao's marriage track. Irrfan and Chitrangada need no introduction. Arunoday is ex-Cabinet minister Arjun Singh's grandson while Aditi Rao is the bua from Delhi 6. Both of them are quite the revelation – Arunoday showcasing his good physique and acting and Aditi Rao coming across as quite smouldering despite her cute Nauheed-Cyrusi-looks. In fact there is a constant sexual tension between her and Arunoday, resulting in about a dozen slaps and two dozen liplocks in the movie But Chitrangada Singh takes all the male attention as the sultry and smoking-hot singer Priti. She forms the linchpin of the movie – not very different from her debut movie Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi – where two men are vying for her charms. The difference is that Yeh Saali Zindagi has a busload of other weirdos – gangster brothers Bade & Chhote, corrupt cop Satbeer and the motley group of henchmen.This is not Sudhir Misra's most serious movie by a mile – but the director seems to be having fun here. There script is manic, punctuated by languid frames of Chitrangada - yet there is an air of nonchalance through out the movie which stands it in good stead over other movies of its genre. In comparison, Kaminey feels almost formulaic. And because of its exaggerated eccentricity, this movie will not appeal to everyone. But if you keep up with it, Yeh Saali Zindagi will reward you will a tumultuous thrilling ride packed with a lot of fun.You can read more of my reviews at http://bombaycinephile.blogspot.com" 
" Good Stuff...","Sudhir Mishra's Cinema appeals only to his fans. He is known, but he has never been a top-grade, filmmaker. Looking at his career, I seriously thought he was majorly over-looked, and I always wondered if he will ever get the name he kinda deserves.'Yeh Saali Zindagi' is Mishra's only Box Office Success in years. This is a path-breaking film for him, as it made money at the ticket window.I enjoyed 'Yeh Saali Zindagi'. Though this one is a overly abusive & twisted fare, what stands as a plus in this romantic-drama, is it's writing. The first hour is power-packed. The second hour gets confusing at times, but a satisfying climax leaves you happy.Mishra's direction is quite good. The screenplay packs in memorable dialogue. The Cinematography comes across well, while the music is a mixed bag. Editing is alright. Acting-Wise: Irrfan Khan does a good job. Arunoday Singh is impressive. Chitrangda Singh & Aditi Rao Hydari are passable. Sushant Singh is absolutely Fantastic, and quite frankly owns the film. Saurabh Shukla is fun. Prashant Narayanan is morbid, while Yashpal Sharma leaves a mark. Vipin Sharma does well. Others support well. On the whole, This is some Good Stuff." 
" A full paced dark comedy........Satire","This is the new epoch of cinema and we want something invigorating. YEH SAALI ZINDAG is an illustration of modern society and has each elements of a cult film.Sudhir Mishra is one of the finest directors, making effort to augment the magnitude of films. It is an exemplary movie with great performance and script. This is a genre of "stylish" film-making and dark humor, this has both in abundance. This is almost as stylish as it gets: fascinating visuals, odd camera angles and various tricks, sound effects, etc. Most of the characters in this bizarre crime film have colorful nicknames and profoundly profane.There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and YEH SAALI ZINDAGI is one of them. Nothing happens on screen without it having an effect on the plot.I think Guy Ritchie's "Lock Stock and Two smoking barrels", "Snatch" & "Rock N Rolla" are the foundation of YEH SAALI ZINDAGI.Irfan is simply outstanding – an actor of very high capability. Arunoday shows potential of a good actor; Chritrangda is ravishingly beautiful and delivers a good performance. Shushat Singh, Saurabh Shukla, Yashpal Sharma, Prashant Narayan and Vipin Sharma are delight to watch. Aditi Rao Hydari is beautiful and talented.It is visually stunning, editing is brisk and music is fantastic.This is a laugh out loud ride with a lot of expletives, so watch out who you are accompanying." 
" 10/10","Yeh Saali Zindagi is one of the films which i have watched many many times. an ensemble cast with likes of Irrfan, Yashpal Sharma, Saurabh Shukla, Prashant Narayanan, Sushant Singh and Chitrangada Singh, it gives ample chance to all of them and newcomers Arunoday and Aditi Rao also don't disappoint at all. even the junior actors are utilized so well, the kidnappers, Mehta's goons, etc. which we seldom see in Bollywood films. Irrfan is at his best once again. the dialogues are mind-blowing. all the actors have put together a gem of a movie. Sudhir Mishra shows once again, that he is still at par with the best in the business. awesome film, much underrated because of the Bollywood mainstream is hijacked by a handful, many of whom keep making nonsensical movies (even remakes of them)." 
" An underdog treat-mostly of two love stories that end well.","Tone, Script & Story: The story is divided into few smaller stories, story of CA Arun & singer Priti, newly married couple Kuldeep (small gangster) and Shanti, business tycoon Singhania & politician Verma, Gangster (brothers) Bade & chotey, Mehta & Inspector Satbir. Kuldeep is assigned work to kidnap Sighania's son and Vermas daughter. One thing leads to another. Priti ends up paying ransom with help of Verma (arranged by Arun). Kuldeep and Satbir distribute Bade's money among themselves. Arun ends up adding to headache of his Boss Mehta.There are three things that set up the bar up high in this movie. 1) The secret admirer of Priti (Arun). 2) How Arun comes to know password of his boss Mehta. 3) Last but not the least how Shanti asks about the money and to keep it. He (Kuldeep) is not that dirty and deserves a fair chance.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: In my opinion it is one of the bests from Sudhir Mishra directorial. Screenplay and Cinematography stay justified. Music: Music is very good. Acting: Goes well along with direction and right star cast. Final Verdict: An underdog treat-mostly of two love stories that end well. It is nicely scripted fictional account one must not miss." 
" Yeh Saali Zindagi (2011)","Very Great Movie. Actual words used which we hear in normal life, with Irfan khan at his best. Arun's (Irrfan Khan) dialogs..the best one being. .... A total justice to the title of the movie "Yeh Saali Zindagi". Yeh Saali Zindagi, by far, is the most 'entertaining' film directed by Sudhir Mishra. YEH SAALI ZINDAGI is a racy entertainer which blends the right amount of romance, comedy and thrill. You will regret throughout your life for missing this one! Dark, devious and different, Yeh Saali Zindagi is brain-and-brawn drama The film, just like life, is replete with unexpected twists and never ceases to amaze! ." 
" entertaining","Irfan Khan is hopelessly in love with Chitrangada Singh......in fact so, so, so much that he is willing to do anything for her.......But alas......she is in love with somebody else !!Aaaah !! The pains and the heartbreak of one-sided love....But wait !!.....there's hope on the horizon !!......Chitrangada's lover is a double-crosser who is fooling her .......besides , he's too too much of a big-shot to marry a poor singer like her......But when will Chitrangada realise....... oh my darling darling Chits.......Meanwhile Chitrangada's' boyfriend is kidnapped , and Chitrangada moves heaven and earth trying to save his life...............And who is there ever-ready to help her ??.......to comfort her in moments of despair ??........Who else but our very own Mr bumbling wannabe hero--Irfan khan !!And all the time he's hoping ......hoping......hoping against hope , that she will say those golden ......no , no silver words ( speech is silver , silence is golden , remember ) --' I LOVE YOU '.......But the wait for those words is a interminably long one.............but does darling Chits really say those life shaking words to Irfan ???Go and see the movie for that........ . . . . . . . . Sorry to disappoint you folks , but actually the movie is not so romantic as I made it out to be ........But the Irfan-Chitrangada plot is the most important one in a movie having many sub-plots.............And a movie full of confusion......The hots are provided by newcomer Anita Rao , who kisses Arunodaya Singh with abandon , and looks so lovely , so delicate ......her skin seems so white , so soft .......a lot of people in the theater were wishing to be in Arunodaya's place !!Now enough of daydreaming , and back to reviewing.......The story unfolds in delhi and its environs, and director Sudhir Mishra does manage to get a grip on the confusion , while the movie goes on with generous dose of real-time uncensored abusing delhi-north Indian style , and doses of shooting and killing .........All the characters ( and believe me , there are too many ), and even the minor ruffians ,are introduced by their screen names coming on screen , giving the movie a whacky feel as it moves from delhi to georgia in the former soviet union to climaxing in mumbai ................where Irfan is still waiting for darling chits to say those words he's been waiting for all his life......verdict -- alls well that ends well ( amen to that )" 
" Superb","Sudhir Mishra is one of the directors we reckon with, ever since IS RAAT KI SUBAAH NAHIN and several more great films he has been known for making great films. Yeh Saali Zindagi is another addition to those. The film may seem chaotic but it's treated superbly by Mishra. The film is very complicated to start with, with numerous voiceovers, narrators being changed from character to character yet it's all amazingly handled. The film moves in flashback mode, slowly we are introduced to the numerous characters and the twists and turns keep you hooked. In fact even smaller characters are given great detail and it's well woven into the screenplay. Sudhir Mishra known for making complicated films but yet handling them without being chaotic uses his midas touch yet again giving the film the extra sheen of the genius. The length also isn't too much 134 mins(16 reels) Music by Nishit Khan is superb and the songs are well woven Dialogues are superb, acidic yet powerfulAmongst actors all are given strong characters Irrfan Khan is superb as always, conveying all through his subtle expressions Chitraganda Singh is awesome in her role Arunoday Singh(who was recently seen in the terrible Jism 2 where he gave a terrible performance) was decent in this role, this was his 4th role after SIKANDAR, AISHA and MIRCH but somehow it was shown in the credits Introducing. He has a meaty role and does a good job Aditi Rao Hyderi is awesome, she played a cameo in Delhi 6 before but again she is shown introduced, she does a good job, recently she was seen in ROCKSTAR Amongst rest Yashpal Sharma, Sushant Singh are admirable as usual, Prashant Narayanan does get a shorter role but he is superb as always as Chote. Amongst rest all are good" 
" This Damned Life","Shortly after I had started to get excited over the highly acclaimed Bollywood Neo-Noir Johnny Gaddaar finally arriving in the post,I was happy to discover an exciting-looking Gangster Neo-Noir Bollywood film being sold for a surprisingly cheap price at my local CEX!.With the delivery date for Johnny Gaddaar still being a few days away,I decided to take a look at the "Dammed (lives) Life" of this cleverly made film.The plot:As the blood from a bullet wound in his back starts to drip out,Arun begins to think about the events which have led to his current situation,whilst the girl who he is secretly attractive to (Priti) attempts to keep him conscious. A few days earlier:Being told by a gangster (Metha) who he had spent several months helping to make some pretty shady "business" deals succeed,that he was going back on his promise and not giving him a penny from any of the deals that they had made together.Arun decides that he needs to get the most attention possible over Metha's backstabbing.This leads Arun to hanging on a ledge,and almost accidentally killing himself!,until a group of friends arrive in the nick of time,and stop him from becoming a piece of road kill.Giving in to Arun's display of insanity,Metha sets up a meeting where he tells Arun again that he will not give him a single penny.With the meeting crumbling right before his eyes,Arun beings to think about the first ever time he had experienced "love at first sight",when he had seen a singer called Priti perform during a night on the town from long ago with Metha.Impressivly pulling back the meeting from breaking point and making it into a successful stalemate,Arun decides to celebrate his achievement by giving his lover-in waiting a call.Expecting to hear excitement over his surprise phone call,Arun is angered to discover that Priti seems to have become romantically involved with a man called Shyam Singhania (whose secretly seeing,(and is engaged) to a daughter of a powerful politician.)Deciding to pay a surprise visit,Arun heads for Shyam's house to show that he wont give up without a fight to win Priti's heart.Getting himself all prepared to open his car door,walk up and finally knock on Singhania's door.Arun,is stopped dead in his tracks,when a rag-tag group of gangsters, (who do not know of Priti's presence in the house) suddenly break into Shyam's house,to kidnap Singhania,and the politician's daughter in order to demand a potentially damaging ransom View on the film:From the opening credits that would make Saul Bass loudly applaud,co- writer/ (along with Manu Rishi Chadha and Swanand Kirkire) director Sudhir Mishra displays a stunning level of skill,which makes each of the (originally separate) plot lines ones that can be enjoyed separately,and also as a whole.Mishra cleverly interlocks the plot lines into a terrific Neo-Noir style Thriller,from the first scenes in the film featuring Arun (played by a brilliantly smart and sneaky Irrfan Khan) having a meeting with Metha, (the enjoyably moody Saurabh Shukla)the first thing which completely grabbed my attention was the writers fantastically gritty dialogue that mixes wonderfully sharp moments of swearing,with a grim Film Noir narration and a terrific group of "outlaw" gangsters.During my viewing of this excellent movie,I originally started to get a bit fearful that this (potentially) great film may be about to fall apart at any moment!,due to Mishra introducing each of the characters in an extremely fast pace that only allows a broad outline to be initially made.Impressivly,Mishra makes sure that the film's thread's never become too tangled,with the after effect of the kidnapping allowing the writers to show the full desperation and confusion that all of the characters are experiencing as a result of the kidnapping and hidden desires.Along with the terrific twisting & turning screenplay,Mishra's brilliant,creatively stylised directing, (with highlights being scenes such as the gangsters tense invasion of Shyam's house,and a weirdly funny "missed bullet".)helps to create an amazing setting for his wonderfully intense and disturbed characters." 
" Yeh "PULP" Zindagi","Yeh "PULP" Zindagi When Sudhir Mishra goes Tarantino's way ---> The result : A twisty turvy haphazard love story crisscrossed by mafia along with lots of pun and lots of humor yielding Clip. Yeh Saali Zindagi is a real Pulp movie, where there is a story inside the story and flashback inside flashback. Gangster falling in love with a Bar-Singer, who is in love with an Ex rich tycoon, who is engaged to a minister's daughter, who should be kidnapped by a Mafia from Russia in lieu of getting his elder brother out of Tihar Jail, who knows the accounts number of several Swiss banks account, which he finally tells to his side kick, who wanted to leave the gang because he's a lovely kissable wife and a trustworthy corrupt cop, who cannot be trusted .......... The story cannot be more real and complicated. Sudhir Mishra was too good in penning them down and then turning the characters on the celluloid . After "Iss Raat ki Subah Nahin" and "Chameli", he has come a long way with wit and humor, and this time he is back with a Roller-coaster. The ride is thrilling and amazing when its comes to the characterization. The castings continued with the names splattered all over the screen , even a small side kick is introduced with an introduction. It was a good format adopted by Mishra, and excellent handling by Sachin Kumar Krishnan and Archit D Rastogi for their camera and editing respectively. Not to forget the dialogues , written with a twist of humor and dash of rougeness, pro-founding the real Delhi. Manu Rishi along with Mishra were superb with their pens as it cut through the real nerve of the movie. The movie went forward with their wit thrust and was real quick. Irrfan khan was subtle in playing a smart underworld investment consultant but a dumb-ass when it comes to Love. He was superb with his lines and timings. He is one such actor who is actually turning out like that of early Naseerudin Shah and Om Puri.The muse is still a muse, Chitrangda Singh again with her power role after Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi. She is charming and a playgirl with a brain and suited to the character of rock star with her sultry looks. The not so maiden diva was a delight in this male stuffed milieu. Arunoday Singh was wasted earlier in Aisha, Mirch and Sikander. This time the director's baby was a good deliverable when he came to play a lover and a henchman. Aditi Rao Hyadri, was a real treat, when it came to passionate love making scenes. She broke the record of Mallika Sherawat with 22 kisses in YSZ against 18 from Khwaish. This Delhi-6 aunt has really come a long way. While Sushant Singh,Yashpal Sharma and Prashant Narayanan were competent with their part. Saurabh Shukla , as a fat spitted scoundrel was too good especially with his the dirty rotten philosophy. He played the gangster or the moll with raw perfection. The music composed by sitarist Nishat Khan was with terms with the movie and its pace. and the lyrics by Swanand Kirkire esp for the title track was worth the title.The killing of Ex-kidnap kingpin resulting in a long fart was something really creative.A Pulp story served sizzling..." 
" Extraordinary for the less ordinary","I have watched Yeh Saali Zindagi twice, and my wife still thinks that I have watched it only once (with her). This is the first time in my life that I have tried to encourage those who have not watched this movie to go for it (I have matured as a cinema enthusiast a bit late) and go for it soon enough. I will not talk anything about the movie and how it goes, because it can be enjoyed most only by watching it. It would be easy to get a bit lost in the first one hour with the never ending introduction of characters, but as the plot keeps on unfolding (or folding :)), an appreciation of characters is bound to develop. I am sure all those Tarantino fans out there will not miss it. Its an extraordinary movie for the not so ordinary movie watchers. After all the director is the one who wrote the story of one of the legendary comedy movies of all time in Bollywood -- 'Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron'. Don't wait for the television version, as a lot of punching dialogues will surely get censored and they are an integral part of that movie."
