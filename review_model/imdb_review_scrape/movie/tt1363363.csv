" Movie tries hard to make you laugh, but fails...!","I saw this movie yesterday, actually i didn't want to.but my friends forced me.. i went without a single expectation.and i won.. we know in Bollywood movies we have to keep our brain at home.but for this movie you should keep yourself at home. I am struggling to actually review this movie, not because of its weak story-line or because of its total lack of imagination.today's directors think they will make any movie and people will appreciate it because movie was so illogical. i suggest you to don't watch this movie in theater & home also.i m giving 1/10 stars to this movie" 
" Chatur singh no star","i have only one question which movie is better tees maar khan or chatur singh two star? I can give one hint any how i have managed to watch complete tees maar khan but i was not able to watch chatur sign two star more than 30 minutes. I think making comedy movie is difficult than making any other type of movie because its not easy to make public laugh. I went to see this movie because of the Sanjay datt and his previous comedy movies like munna bhai series. But after watching this movie i can say that only a good actor can't make a good movie. I have no doubt about comic talent in sanjay dutt. but i can say that these have no clues about what is comedy movie. Don't see this movie there is nothing in this movie." 
" A Bollywood version of Jacques Clouseau","This movie tries to impersonate Jacques Clouseau but fails to do so.The only reason I went for this movie was Anupam Kher, Shakti Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt are all good when it comes to comedy but the plot of the movie let them down badly here.There is no proper plot, no proper story but watching it feels like you're looking at a bad version of Jacques Clouseau. The movie attempts to make you laugh but fails miserably to say the least.The acting of Amisha Patel seems corny and just goes to show how her career has taken a down slide since Kaho Na Pyar Hai.To summarize, it is not a good movie and you're time would be wasted so don't go expecting another Munna Bhai MBBS because this just ain't it." 
" The Worst movie of any time...","I thought I am watching a CCTV video of a mental hospital. Only 10% of the jokes are laughable but overall the movie is not worth watching. As the other reviews say that even the great actors image has been thrown down because of the plot is very true. I could not believe that I am looking at Sanjay Dutt and Anupam Kher. They are my favourite actors and it was really sorrowful to watch them performing in this movie. My advice to people is don't watch this movie even if you have lots of money and time. Instead of that you can spend time with any crack head person you will get more entertained. I hope the producers and directors will come up with better movies in the future...." 
" hmmm... what !!! oh yeah, movie....","I have seen a fair share of pathetic movies. I even endured Dev anand's Mr Prime minister on a bad morning with a hangover. However, nothing and I mean nothing in world could make me watch this film again ever. I consider it a very strong statement because I believe that ever is a long time. From start till ending, its just rambling and patchy screenplay. There is no plot, storyline or anything cinematic. Despite the cast with a proved track record in comedies, CS2S fails miserably. Only things it ever does is that it stays true to your expectation of it being pathetic. I chose to say that this is Pathetic movie for want of more derogatory word. AVOID this movie with a capital A, Capital V, Capital O, Capital I and Capital D." 
" A very cheap imitation of famous Peter Seller's PINK PANTHER series.","Its not easy to make a SLAPSTICK Comedy because one can easily fall in the category of OVER-DOING it. So, you need to have an exceptional skill of directing such comical sequences with the right dosage of comedy, absurdity, humor and soft violence. Charlie Chaplin mastered this art in the early years of the last century and then it was further nurtured by the names such as Laurel & Hardy, The Marx Brothers, The Three Stooges, Mr. Bean and many more.CHATUR SINGH TWO STAR also falls in this same category of Slapstick Comedies but sadly it stands amongst the worst ones ever tried in the Hindi Cinema. Cheaply based on all copied sequences from the famous PINK PANTHER series movies, this shabby comedy doesn't even deserve a FREE TICKET outing spending your precious two hours in the theater. Its quite understandable to watch such attempted slapstick comedies keeping our logic aside. But even then the film at least has to offer something to the viewer to enjoy and laugh at. Unfortunately CSTS fails in that department completely and just remains a silly kind of film which assumes that there are fools sitting in the theater who would laugh at any crap they will show in the name of cinema.While watching all the childishly copied scenes on the screen, I was just thinking that what actually inspired actors like Sanjay Dutt, Anupam Kher and Gulshan Grover to sign such a low grade film made without any vision or content. Director Ajay Chandhok makes Sanjay play the role of a (supposed to be) funny Inspector written all around the original character of Inspector Clouseau from The Pink Panther Series played by Peter Sellers and Steve Martin in its various sequels. The writers not only copy from those western scripts but the stylists also copy the look, costumes and overall persona of the lead character from the ORIGINALS. But frankly what you are shown on the screen is not even close to that famous hilarious series more known for the brilliant clumsy act performed by Peter Sellers.In short, it would be a big waste to write more on this forgettable venture and I would rather like to recommend watching "Tom & Jerry" along with your kids instead of opting for CHATUR SINGH TWO STAR even on a DVD." 
" Sanju should be jailed for doing this movie","Despite being a die hard fan of Sanju Baba, this is easily the worst movie of his career. Yes, the string of flops he gave in the 80s were way better than this one. 
My heart broke when I heard news of him being sent to jail. But after watching this movie, I guess he should be jailed just for doing this!"
