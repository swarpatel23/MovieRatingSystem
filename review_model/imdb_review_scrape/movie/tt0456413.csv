" Say no to Piracy!!","I found this movie something like cheap piracy on a bollywood scale. Cooked up by a bunch of 'angrejji filam Dee Bhee Dee' freaks who wanted to have a take on the original. My advice to these all knowing iMovie and mobile 3gp idiots is : go and feel the actual Fight Club effect. Stop calling yourselves filmmakers, bothering your chacha-s and mama-s for funding your stupid ideas, go try an mba course or something - make mummy papa happy and proud! Shameless geeks didn't even bother to find a suitable title. Using same catch line's even dialogues for describing rules of "Phite Kilub".Same for desi nuts with 'da greatest movie eva' taste. Please take time to understand why those phirangs made such a dark and exhilarating movie, before spurting out cheap, foolish desi remarks about classic flush-jobs like this one" 
" Fight to see the complete movie!!","In the first place, the name of the movie is itself misplaced, leave the actors! The idea of fight club evaporates soon after police raided the place and in the second half, it has nothing to with fight club, apart from bringing it as a faint link to a murder.And yes, the movie has also nothing to do with the Hollywood movie with the same name. The story-writer (that too Sohail Khan!!) tried hard to keep the story away from that movie, but after some time, he got off the track and followed the age-old B-grade bollywood movie formula..."vengeance". Four friends got together to build fight club where everybody will settle their problem through duel. After a short stint of laughable fight (including cat fight), soon police raid the place and our heroes gave up their idea. Wait, they got some other reason to be engaged...the uncle of Somail got murdered and our lads went to Delhi to run the night club owned by him. The dreaded gang-lord (Rahul Dev, aided with Ashmit Patel) came heavily after them. After that, the story ran to every direction possible and I am afraid to pen it down here. Forgive me.In a movie where most of the actors are model-turned-actor or vice-versa (!) you can not expect much acting. Actually, it is not their fault. Without a story or direction, they don't have any option other than showing funky clothing or chiseled bodies. Ashish Chowdhry did his best to bring some moronic comedy, but thanks to him, these were some rare relief-time in the movie! And thanks to Sohail Khan, the producer, too for not bringing five heroines for five heroes! Amrita Arora and Diya Mirza are enough to establish the fact that "standing in front of the camera has nothing to do with acting"!! Suniel Shetty and Sohail Khan tried to enact some no-non-sense godfather-like roles, but with a wooden face, one can not really help a movie much. The brightest point of the movie is Ashmit Patel. With straight hairdo he tried with wear a stealthy cool assassin look, and to some extent, he is successful.The bottom-line is that if you want some popcorn movie with some 'flying' action you can try this one at you on risk. But if you want a good movie, never ever try." 
" flop club","My God such a filmCopy the title FIGHT CLUB and half the script and add Bollywood nonsense and a film is ready The film starts off interestingly but then you are thrown into some good fight scenes in the fight club and then to romance, comedy, music the boredom sets inThe story fails to involve you, even the characters of Rahul Dev, Suneil Shetty and Ashmith are clich√©d type though Suneil's character is well handled in parts The script fails to involve you, There are many flaws too The screenplay lacks the meat to keep you involvedIt's like they just tried to appeal to the youth so they made such a crap sadly even youth showed their back to itThe screenplay has lots of convenient situations too and lots of stunts and stunts in second half The introductions of Sohail many times also is too much The film does get interesting in last 15 minutes but the fight scene in the end is so badly handled it cringes and then suddenly the film is endedOverall this Fight Club is a FLOP CLUB Reasons: The cast includes Zayed Khan, Ashmith Patel, Dino Morea so it should be called FLOP CLUBThe number of audiences who went to watch it were less then the starsThe film lacks a strong screenplay and the film which starts interesting though the concept of fight club in India is too convenient But what follows is slowly a routine mishmash action potboilerDirection by Vikram Chopra is bad Music is decent Stunts are okay at places, but the overdose of slow motion effects gets to youAmongst actorsSuneil Shetty- He is decent in his role but goes awry in the climax Ritiesh- Poor buddy does well in his small 2-3 scene role Zayed Khan- decent Dino Morea- ordinary Ashish Chaudhary- worst performance, he irritates Yash Tonk- good but tends to overact Ashmith Patel- awful Rahul Dev- OkayActresses Dia Mirza- small role she is good Amrita Arora- most confusing role, she is nothing great Neha Dhupia- 2-3 minute role" 
" Fight any desire to see this JUNK, or it will club you senseless","Goodness gracious, Follywood's ripoff dodos are at it again! Will they ever stop?!Just as if stealing the title from a Hollywood original is not enough, do they have to conform to their own stale formula-fares each and every time?? The story isn't much to write about -- four buddies that decide to settle scores the old-fashioned way, by whacking anyone that gets in their way. Hilarious, except its not funny.The only good thing about this movie is that they spent tons of cash on promos (thereby making at least their vendors rich). Of course, its the latest Follywood "thinking" (?!) -- promote a film to death, recovering all the costs before the audience realizes what hit them. Fortunately, multiplex audiences in India nowadays are too smart for that.And in NJ/NY, the movie tried hard to package itself as a new "Phormula For An Instant Headache". But the renowned pharma companies like Pfizer, Merck and Eli Lilly instantly rejected that idea as old 'mad'-icine in a new tedium. Tough luck." 
" 4 Jokers and 3 bimbo = Fight club","I cant say this to be a complete trash as this flick do had some high points but despite of all these facts this movie definitely needs some work around, especially the casting director for repeatedly making the same mistake.Movie has a story(As per Bollywood Standard)and have all the thadka which needs to please Auto Drivers and College students(i watched this stuff in 3 rd year BE) but yes its the misfit casting which let down the show. Scenes are funny, and one liners are average but it couldn't make much impact as this was the directorial debut for Vikram Chopra, so cant expect much from his side.I don't want to get into the territory of plagiarizing/ rip off/ Lift etc etc,since 9 out of 10 movies here follow the suit, so hardly makes any difference.Performance wise Anna was rocking, Rahul Dev, as usual great but yes it was Ashmit Patel who i think was revelation, wish this was his Debut movie; full ishtylish...Female crew staff was more like the Dance Bars item girls, Amrita Arora was in her Delhi Ki sardi fever(Zameen) and Dia Mirza and Zayeed had there extended Love story from movie DUS, but honestly its a mistake to accept ANYTHING from Mr KHAN .... Zayed Khan. Sohail was as usual, Boxer Bhai... straight from the sets of his debut movie Maine Dil tujko diya.. Ritesh Deshmuk was almost wasted and Khulbushan Kharbanda was in the Thankless role, looks like he was returning favor for I proud to be Indian.Yash Tonk was equally Good and Bad, don't accept much from TV artists.. ah how can i forget Ashish Chowdary, he was in his prequel state of Dhamaal.... Gujrati pervert bhai Movie could have been still better but its the climax that brings the bad taste to Ur mouth and since movie ends like this, the taste remains there. Movie is one time watch, preferably on TV ...." 
" Its Not THAT Bad!","this is a movie which was much hyped and promoted before launch, it has quite a few known names in it, but after a gazillion bollywood remakes it seems pointless to Rip off of 99's David Flintcher movie "Fight Club" which is one of the best movies of all time!but surprise! this movie is not a Rip off! heck the only thing similar is the main title, other than that, its a different movie altogether, yes there is a fight club, but the logic of it is also very different, I for one enjoyed the film, its a masala movie with songs, fights and romance, all in one! so of the action choreography was bit over the top, but not too much. i heard people complain endlessly about this film, and rip offs, but this isn't one of the case. Maybe the director liked the name fight club? but whatever the case maybe, watch this film if u like complete entertainers, with comedy actions romance etc etc, the music of the film is also good, but the best but some parts went with the film very well." 
" More like a one but the girls give it an additional 2.","I went into this movie expecting Sh@# and i got just that. Any all all words to describe how bad this movie is less.Acting, directing, story, dialogue such words are almost non-existent the only person who stands out is Aashish Choudhary and that to because he is so annoying. That brings me to the only things in the movie that are tolerable:-. 1. The women are lovely even Neha Dhupia in a cameo looks ravishing i really liked all of the heroines and somehow i lasted this film thanks to them. 2. The songs are quite good and even though they maybe run of the mill except for Chorre ki Baatein which is a crazy song, they make the movie tolerable.Don't watch this movie if you want to retain your sanity. It isn't close to being a remake of the original." 
" GO GO GO GO fight club!! its a gr8 movie","OH MY GOD!! i went to the premiere of fight club yesterday and it is so good. lol its an amazing movie and dino n zayed n sohail look really good. lol its such a good movie and got lots of action in and the violence can't be helped with a title like FIGHT CLUB! the songs are good and and the music is fanstastic although there is some theft of main hoon na music but not that much of it. Sunil shetty plays well as a don but some of the storyline is a bit far-fetched. overall its a really good movie and the actors play their roles well and its just a bit of everything really. i'm glad i've seen it and its really good, definitely worth the watch." 
" A Night Club for Fighters","This Action-packed thriller somehow manages to join the rare club of Pure Action Hindi films, and this is one positive attribute about the film. Another plus point is allocation of almost equal and balanced screen time to each of the characters. Stunt sequences are brilliantly executed and are amply supported by good camera-work and editing. The problem? Choice of subject One suggestion-First half of the film should completely be chopped off. It should be a 90 minutes film starting from post-interval. Reason, well there is no purpose, direction or motivation in the first half in terms of narration. The reason for finding the fight club is illogical. The story for no apparent reason just shuffles between Mumbai and Delhi. Post interval the film changed from Fight Club to Night Club. Though story about gangsters trying to take over a club forcibly is nothing new but it is the brisk pace of the film that brings some relief. So what are those bombshells doing in the film. Well they pop out from nowhere to drop some "item-bombs" to make sure to a particular audience ¬ñ look we are also in the team. Imagine one of them being a doctor by profession. Performances ?? Dino and Reitesh are finally getting better in expression Dept. Sohail Khan fitted the bill of a perfect fighter and nothing else. Both Zayed and Ashish should do something about their "put-on" irritating dialog style and mannerism otherwise it will be hard for them to continue in the scene. Ashmit Patel is the surprise packet as a real evil-headed. Our Bombshell? Are you really interested in knowing? Songs though are hummable but Music Director Pritam very conveniently used his tune "mummy ko nahi hai pata" from film chocolate (2005) in the song "you got to go fighter". Actor turned director Vikram Chopra should have chosen a better subject and concrete storyline for his debut film." 
" It's Good!!","The movie is amazing.... 4 friends... the fight club.... the trouble they get into and Yash Tonk's crazy acting was funny....i liked it's story.... specially the last action scenes... and of course Ritesh Deshmuk's dialogue... well we're used to seeing him in a funny role... but i guess this is good for a change.... Everyone played their roles well... can't see anything wrong with the movie... except for some high jumps and one person fighting a dozen which is most common in bollywood movies...The ladies were good... even though not given many scenes... I like it.... better than the other movies released this year..." 
" Not great, but not THAT bad","Original is better, by far. But this movie was pretty entertaining, with some slow motion moves during some fights and some pretty good action scenes. the music is meh,some being good to great while others are a bit bad. this movie could have done better, they shouldn't have used the same title, but since they did, they should have made relative to the original, like a sequel of how the events of the original movie affected India or something. Otherwise, made a movie influenced by the original with a different title altogether.please excuse my lazy typing! Score for actual movie quality 5/10 entertainment score 7/10" 
" Paisa solo film","This movie was so entertaining but it's really good to be able and enjoyable I am very happy to see it Screenplay is outstanding story-line is brilliant direction is superb editing is interesting Songs are impressive and the background music is superb Zayed was superb rite-sh was superb so-hail khan was superb Dino was superb ashish was amazing Sunil shetty was impressive Rahul was awesome dia was outstanding neha was nice Amrita was good ya-sh was great ashmit pa-tel was superb khulbhushan is remarkable Overall my rating is 8/10"
