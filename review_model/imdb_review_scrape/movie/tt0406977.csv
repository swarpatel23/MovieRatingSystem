" Hilarious movie","This was a really funny movie.  I have never seen so much sexual humor in an Indian movie before.  It was a funny surprise.  Everyone gave an awesome performance except for Ritesh Deshmukh.  What was he doing in this starcast? He lacked any expressions whatsoever, and his acting was not convincing of all.  My favorite was Aftab--he was hilarious!  Lara, Vivek, Ajay, and the wives were great.  The dialogues and the story was terrific, even if it got just a little serious in the second half.  You can tell that the cast had great chemistry.  Songs were good.  "On the Roof, in the Rain" was the best with the title song as a close runner-up.  It was nice how the songs maintained the light atmosphere of the movie." 
" certainly the biryani in a menu of daals....","Masti  a movie that surpassed all my expectations and went on to become one of my most enjoyed movies this year. Going in to watch this movie I had all the reservations  no actors that I really did like; a director that I had written off since his Ishq days; songs that I had not heard of; and the expectation that bollywood cannot do comedy humour for the British audience. How wrong was I going to be proven!!!The comedy was spot on as were the apparent and intended lines and joke  this movie seriously did take the comedy to a crude new level not seen in bollywood. One would have to say that this movie did indeed take one step further for bollywood as American Pie did for Hollywood. The songs certainly did grow on me, especially the 'seyya ji' item number  the others are just as tappy (except the 'one the roof'  well all can't be perfect!!!). The next surprise was that this great movie was from none other than Indra Kumar  someone I had written off since his movie ISHQ over a decade ago. The director had to be good, talented and experienced to have this great comedic timing as well as being able to juggle all the actors. Finally, the actors were good and have to say that I am beginnings to like Vivek and certainly beginning to adore Amrita Rao  this girl is hot and one to watch out for.Having seen this movie I will have to say that I will defiantly be open to the idea that bollywood can do comedy, but will be more excited about Indra Kumars next venture. One movie that I will certainly recommend that you watch, and if you have already watched it I will recommend that you go and watch it again." 
" Entertaining fare!!!","Yet again we have three principal characters around whom the whole movie revolves. Isn't that a bit too much inspiration since Dil Chahta Hain? Anyways, the movie justifies each of them nevertheless. Without giving away too much about the plot, its three guys who decide to have extra-marital affair and land into trouble. And then its hilarious cat-and-mouse game with cops (ie. Ajay Devgan). Noteworthy are the wives of our heros who have distinct character one of them being extremely religious, one being dominative and one being possessive ("You miss me, na?" - Amrita Rao stands out!).What makes this movie click? Well, the one-liners, sexual innuendos, comedy scenes, properly placed songs and the stern Police Officer.The director was crystal-clear of the product he wanted to deliver - a fun filled sexual comedy, and has added each bit that seamlessly integrates with the main storyline. And he has been successful, I must admit." 
" Hilarious Movie! Great acting, but perhaps a weak plot.","Masti is one of the most enjoyable Indian comedies released since 'Dil Chatah Hai', and is a must see for Bollywood movie goers who enjoy comedies and are open minded.The start of the movie is superb, with effortless acting and great comic timing shown by the main actors; the first 1/3 of the movie deserves a 10/10. Later however, the film tries to take itself too seriously and fails in some respects; Ajay Devgan showed dry acting for a very dry role, 'I hate crime, and i hate criminals'; please...However the dialog remains enjoyable throughout, and the ending seems to tie things up well. The songs are also fun and stay within the plot of the film; i.e. no flying off to different locations around the world changing clothes every few lines.As for the girls, Amrita Rao is the Queen of Cute; both she and Lara seem to be the only girls with acting and dancing abilities. However the rest may something to be desired in different departments.All round, this movie is packed full of laughs and Masti, which all make up for the lack of plot, and thus Masti is a must see if you enjoy a good laugh." 
" Looking for a simple laugh? This is the one for you..","Let me start with what a number of reviewers have said already. Masti took Bollywood sexual comedy to a new level. It was a pioneer in foraying into subjects which Hindi movies were really afraid to venture into. There are lots and lots of double-meaning jokes. Another movie which released later and took a similar initiative was "Kya Kool Hain Hum". Three friends, having gotten frustrated by their mundane marriage lives and badgering wives decide to go in the search of women for extra- marital affairs and meet after a month to compare notes. Their misjudgement hurls them onto the path of blackmail, murder and mental torment; where in the end they realize that "ghar ki daal" (home cooked curry) is better than "bahar ki biryani" (out-cooked chicken rice).As for the movie itself, if judged overall, yes - it has a lot of plot holes; yes - the basic premise is far fetched; yes - it can be termed as LGBT-phobic by modern audience, especially if the audience in question is western; and not to mention the sometimes over-the-top and not-so- subtle acting. But it really really works for you if viewed in the context of India in 2004. I was smiling half the movie and a lot of scenes had me in splits.The acting majorly rests on the shoulders of the three leads who have done their job admirably well. They appeared at real ease in most of the scenes and were energetic with the body language and facial expressions. Vivek Oberoi, as a reformed playboy married to a clingy wife, is the unofficial lead of the leads and is a bit constrained than his sidekicks which the usually the case. Ritiesh Deshmukh, as the clueless dentist is awesome in parts especially in the fight scene with his Mother-in-law. But the intermittent visions he has with a fluttering eyelid kind of annoyed me. But, the man who takes the cake and is treat to watch in every scene is undoubtedly Aftab Shivdasani. You can predict each and every expression he is going to have, but still laugh at his antics. The writers could have come up with something better than the "Lele" story line to use his abilities. Ajay Devgan has a one dimensional role and does a one dimensional job. Among the wives, Amrita "the satellite" Rao is the only one who can really act. The other two girls have to improve on a lot of things. Lara Dutta is sensual, but perhaps a little bit tame, as a seductress. They nailed it with the music. "Dil de diya hain" is the song of 2004 for me. All-in-all a fun fare for sure. If you want a 2.5 hour laugh ride to escape a bad day, go for it! In case you are not comfortable with Hindi, make sure you have good subtitles, because a lot of jokes are cultural and slang-based." 
" very enjoyable","I kinda dig the idea of Bollywood films- you know saturated colours, lush decor, amazing outfits and so on- but I never really rent them, since I am quite afraid of the song and dance numbers and the story lines are too highly dramatic.I have seen about 4 Indian films- Agnivarsha, Kama Sutra and Monsoon Wedding and Masti, and I suppose the last one is the only Bollywood one and I really enjoyed it. Kama Sutra wasn't much to talk about, Agnivarsha was excellent, but more esoteric, so between Monsoon Wedding and Masti- I think Masti takes the cake.Monsoon Wedding got quite big here and it was such a trivial story- it started with a promise for something and wound up in nowhere bland land +offered no eye candy. Masti on the other hand doesn't attempt to run for an Oscar and is absolutely fabulously enjoyable and stoked with pretty people and pretty decor and even the music numbers are cool- I watched them." 
" soo funny","oh my!! this film has to get a 10/10 from me! it was too funny! seriously... the actors are really good they really know how to do a comedy role!... the fist time i watched this film i laughed my ass off... and every time i see it now i still laugh my face off... its well funny how everything goes wrong... i love the part where the gold gloves thief's are meant to come n steel money for the pay of murdering that girl... then the real burglars come and take all the money... they they kill that other man by accident...and in all its all just a set up from there wives!... oh my god!... this movie is just to funny!! if you haven't seen it..please go see it!! u will love it...trust me!" 
" Masti for the whole family!","Masti means fun and although the plot of this wonderfully hilarious film borders on the dark side of Masti, it nevertheless has its moments and ultimately delivers what it hoped it would at the start of it all, pure entertainment for one and all. Three men (Vivek Oberoi, Ritesh Deshmukh, and Aftab Shivdasani) upon graduating college, fear what awaits them as they are now eligible bachelors for marriage. The fear that once the get hitched, they would lose their friendship and all that mattered to them as singles. They can lament all they want but slowly and surely, one by one they begin to marry and the years pass by. One day, a chanced reunion sets them taking a trip down memory lane when one of them decides that they can recapture the decadence of their youth by having affairs and they all decide that yes it's the right thing to do. At this point in the film, you will wonder why good-looking men who are married to good-looking women (played by Amrita Rao, Genelia D'Souza and Tara Sharma respectively) would think of such a thing? But when the camera introduces you to the object of their attraction, I guess you can sort of understand why. This Femme Fatale that attracts all three men on separate occasions is played by none other than former beauty queen Lara Dutta. And the song and dance she does with Oberoi is especially spectacular. The casting department for Kaal must have noticed the blinding chemistry between Oberoi and Dutta in this film first. Just wait until all three of them find out that they've been cheating on their wives with the same woman, you will laugh your head off! Archana Puran Singh, Satish Shah and Ajay Devgan round out the supporting cast with hip-slapping-gut-ripping comedic roles. I didn't like the premise of cheating in the film but I couldn't help but laugh as the plot unfolded. If you don't like the premise of men cheating either, just sit back and watch the plot of Masti unfold. This film is one of my favourites." 
" Good","Indra Kumar known for dramatic films mixed with over the top comedy(mostly in first half)e.g. DIL, BETA, ISHQ, AASHIQ tried to make a complete comedy on the lines of American PIEThe film is about adultery, sex treated in a funny way and the jokes are very funny at times especially the problems depicting their marriage and the decision of affair is also treated well The whole angle makes you laugh at times though illogical but you shouldn't ask questions The tempo looses till Lara reveals the plan and then the twist in the tale The Ajay track is very well handled The entire track of Ajay-Viveik- Aftab- Ritiesh is hilarious but some gags are treated badly one is the overdose of the gay jokes which is funny at first and then done to death Also the Rakhi Sawant portion Plus the melodrama towards the finale The climax too isn't that great Direction by Indra Kumar is good in most parts Music is okay Amongst actors Aftab Shivdasani sharpens his comic skills though he is too loud at places but he does a great job in most places Ritiesh steals the show with his brilliant performance He looks the character and plays it with brilliance, his expressions only make you laugh mostly, He is natural Viveik tries a bit hard and does well in some portions but looks out of place in some Lara Dutta is good Ajay Devgan fits his part very well and deadpan humour suits him well Amongst wives Genelia is very good, Amrita does her part well though she is too much at times Tara Sharma bores Archana is hilarious" 
" Masti Masti Masti","MastiAlthough I've already watched this movie and enjoyed it, went to watch it again, this time with the whole family in theater.Medium: Antony theater, Funasia, Dallas.What's new?What can be new when you are watching the movie for the 2nd time? Guess what? There was! I did not notice some of the double meaning jokes very well.. but this time I caught it on big screen.Noticeable: Repeat Viewability was great! It was a wholesome family entertainer! Haath hi mera saathi was among the notables. Also... YE BHI GHODA CHALANEY JAISA HEE HAI... ek baar chalao.. to jaathe hi reh jaatha hai! The repeat view-ability was also unexpected!Verdict: Wonderful movie, great songs and good performances. The characters, especially for the wives were well thought of and if you are married, you can easily identify your wife with one of the three types portrayed. Maybe you will walk out with a solution to your problems ;-) I did not find any solutions though...."

" A film suitable for framing... If your frame is a toilet.","This review contains possible spoilers... but frankly, this movie is completely rotten anyway, so there is possibly very little to "spoil". So read on, intrepid IMDb browser. The following paragraphs may save you 164 minutes of your life. I know there are about a thousand other things I would have rather done with the time I spent watching "Masti".Dear filmmakers: Why oh why must you insult our intelligence with ridiculous films like this? While the Bollywood comedy genre needs some serious mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, what it doesn't need is the homophobic mouth-to-zipper type humor seen in this film. Seriously, is there anything worse than this film's stereotypical treatment of gay people? Are they simply objects to laugh at and ridicule? The subtitles for this film liberally use the word "fa%*ot*" and the audience is expected to laugh along while (gasp) some fat uncle presupposes the wrong thing about two of the film's main studs. And the humor? It's subtle. Especially if your idea of subtlety is a sledgehammer between the eyes. The actors mime and contort their faces, like they get paid extra to overact. I've seen better acting in kindergarten plays. Meanwhile, the sound effects guy takes turns liberally punching the whistle and "boing!" buttons on his soundboard. The characters are vapid and not very likable. The dialogue is horrible - especially the repeated analogy between "chicken biryani" and adultery. The plot line is just plain silly... especially the "twist" at the end. (Vivek, you really ought to know better, man... maybe it's time to get a new agent.) And of course, we have the obligatory few scenes lifted straight from other movies... including an embarrassing scene involving a toilet plunger "borrowed" from "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". Believe me, folks, "Ace Ventura" - even with Jim Carrey talking through his butt - is pure unfiltered genius compared to "Masti"." 
" Pathetic acting, weak plot, bad movie","I usually try to keep an open mind on movies and find at least one redeeming factor. In this case, I failed miserably.Masti is about three husbands who are frustrated with married life for various silly reasons. One wife (Amrita Rao) doesn't give any space, another one (Genelia D'Souza )wants her husband to be the Indian version of Arnold and the third one (Tara Sharma) is so absorbed with religion that her husband doesnt get any. So what do they do? They plan to have extra-marital affairs. Needless to say, things go wrong with all them and they end up in trouble.The second half of the movie is about how they get out of trouble. I wont subject you to a description. Its not because of the spoilers, but because its simply not worth my time to write it and your time to read it.
Oh, the second half is when Ajay Devgan turns up, over and over again, in unexpected and unnecessary places. Its also when Lara Dutta puts in a reasonable performance. Reasonable because everyone else is so bad.Problems with the movie: 1) Lack of subtlety. The jokes are loud, the acting is loud, the scenes are loud. The movie is not funny. 2) Bad acting. You have to see it to believe it. The ladies can't act, cant dance and are not very pretty. The men simply scream out their lines and again, cant act very well. 3) Weak plot. Thats an understatement. Of the decade.In summary, don't waste your time. Go fish or play golf. Those activities will be much more entertaining." 
" okay!!!! nowt special","I really liked this film it was so funny and had me in stitches, I am a fan of Vivek and i think he is a great actor, Aftab was good and Ritesh was very, very funny, he really suites the comedy roles.Amrita is so cute in this film, she played her role very well and looked beautiful in the red outfit she wore in the movie, even Lara Dutta was pretty good in the film, it just goes to show that you can have both beauty and the talent in bollywood. Basically the story is about 3 guys who are happily married and are a little bored with their lives so they all decide to have a affair? kinda pathetic really but that is what happens, as the film progresses on they meet the same woman and all 3 of them start seeing the same woman at the same time, the ending was pretty crap but the music was really good, i loved that song "ek kuwara", it is a really nice shaadi tune, go and check it out." 
" An amazing comedy!","I love this movie! I have watched this movie many times, and I grow to love it every time.Vivek Oberoi shows loads of potential in this film. He has a a possible flair for comedy and its so fun to watch him! He is pretty cute, and his expressions and actions are hilarious. Aftab Shivdasani, shocked me. He is actually brilliant! I always thought Vivek overshadowed the other two protagonists, but I was obviously wrong! He still has a long way to go, of course, but this is a great start. Ritesh Deshmukh is probably the least funny, but nevertheless, he gives it a shot. The second half belongs to him completely.The three heroines, Amrita Rao, Tara Sharma and Genelia D'Souza, play their roles very well, though I personally feel that Amrita Rao overshadows them all. Not only in looks, but in acting too.Ajay Devgan and Lara Dutta also play parts in this movie. A very impressive performance by each of them, though I feel Ajay was slightly wasted.Comedy all the way." 
" Elements of Shakespeare !","Thoroughly enjoyable movie. More complex than it appears. In fact it strongly reminded me of Shakespeare's comedies with its different themes of love, marriage, fidelity, parents, children, family, friends, society, communication, etc. Yet, like Shakespeare's comedies, you can laugh out loud at the slapstick comedy. Which I did many times! The scene with the three friends and Lara Dutt at the stop light was too hilarious for words! In addition, the movie was interspersed with the occasional song and dance number in the tradition of Shakespeare's comedies, unlike the requisite 5-6 songs/dances required by Bollywood films. I will definitely be on the look out for more films by this writer."
