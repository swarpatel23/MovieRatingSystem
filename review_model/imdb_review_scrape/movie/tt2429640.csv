" A Fair Thriller!","The third installment in the Murder series and the official Bollywood Remake of the Colombian thriller The Hidden Face, 'Murder 3' is A Fair Thriller, that sums up as a one-time watch.'Murder 3' Synopsis: A wildlife photographer tries to solve the mystery of his missing girlfriend.'Murder 3' has a solid first-hour & manages to keep its viewer glued. The second-hour dips, but the culmination is executed nicely. The twist in the tale does offer shock value. Mahesh Bhatt's Writing has meat, but dips in the second-hour. Vishesh Bhatt's Direction is atmospheric. Cinematography is first-class. Editing is sharp. Music is foot-tapping. Performance-Wise: Randeep Hooda is sincere, as always. Aditi Rao Hydari is first-rate. Sara Loren is restricted to a few expressions. Rajesh Shringarpure is capable.On the whole, 'Murder 3' can be viewed once." 
" Average fare, ignore if you have seen the original.","Bhatts have been copycats since they started, except for Arth, Saraansh, Daddy and a few films like Naam, most of Bhatt films have been copies. All 3 Murder Installments have been copies, Murder(2004) was a copy of Unfaithful, Murder 2(Korean film CHASER) both did superbly well at the B.O and the first one made a star out of Emraan Hashmi, The Third Installment stars their regular since Jannat 2 Randeep Hooda. This time however there have made a legitimate remake of A Spanish thriller The Hidden Face(2011). The original was a well made thriller which is too bold for Bollywood, so to fit in the Bhatt formula, we have songs, the profession of the lead hero is changed from a orchestra conductor to a Photographer so that the Bhatts can have skimply clad models showing up. That apart nudity compared to the original is on low here. The film focuses more on emotional content rather then sex but sadly the film is a complete copy paste job from the original, even the lines have the same punch, the few things have been changed which don't fit in. The first half builds in slowly like the original, unlike the original we have Aditi's character shown in the first half itself through a flashback. The first half focuses on Randeep and Sara while the second half solves the mystery. The film may seem alien for Bollywood as there is hardly action and the film flows in a relaxed manner. The film however lacks the punch like in most Bollywood remakes of the original, like for instance there are some loopholes, There is a scene showing Randeep with a kerosene can in his car and later the car is blown up and a body is found, but the scene isn't explained till the end The dialogues and the forced songs too do a lot of harm especially the lines which are changed. The climax is similar to the original, albeit a bit modified and leaves scope for a sequel like the original.Direction by Vishesh Bhatt is ordinary, most of the film is copied but he does handle some scenes well Music is typical Bhatt style, some songs are hummableRandeep Hooda with a new hairstyle gives a decent performance, though the role doesn't demand much from him. Aditi Rao Hyderi is superb in her part, more so in the second half while Sara Loren(perhaps a dubbed voice) seen after the dud Kajra Re(2010) is okay. Rajesh Shringarpure as police officer,Shekhar Shukla and Bugs Bhargava make no much impact." 
" Copy","This is a copy of Spanish film called the hidden face.can u make a film on Ur own?
idiots" 
" CopyCat Movie","It could have been better if they had an own script for the movie. The movie is a copy of the Spanish movie "THE HIDDEN FACE(2011)". It has copied every bit of the movie right from the start where the recording is seen. the Spanish movie has some frontal nudity.That was the only difference seen. The most awaited movie in the series of MURDER was released and was not a movie that should have been come under the title Murder. Given Title must have some reason at some point but there was none in the movie.There was not even a single murder in the movie or anyone had intention for a murder.The movie was not so good compared to its previous parts." 
" Zealous Thriller With Lack Of Originality.","So, I hear the plot is borrowed from a Spanish movie. But, since I haven't watched the original, I would not compare. But, Murder 3, most like its predecessors is a zealous thriller.Randeep Hooda is good but he has done better. Aditi fails while newcomer Sara Loren scores some brownie points with her chutzpah. Both are smokin' hot and are sure to give you half-orgasm somewhere during the 120 minutes. The plot is gripping, since it is legally borrowed but the execution is little unimpressive. It drags in the middle but an effective execution after the interval by débutante Vishesh Bhatt saves the pie. Yes, it doesn't have any masala dances or Dabangg-type silly scenes, but Murder 3 isn't classic cinema. With ounces of humor with a take on D K Bose and oodles of horror, Murder 3 makes a good night entertainer.But like the earlier two flicks, Murder 3 doesn't offer you the same entertainment. Yet it scores because of its different story and inclusion of love. I could sense the script but, you CANNOT predict this plot. That's what I loved about M3. I suggest you don;t go with the title because there is no relation; rather the tag-line which reads – "Love will be murdered", it's a clear indicator of what lies ahead.Bottom line: If you've watched the original, there is no point because Murder 3 is one time thrilling watch.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: No | Sex: Critical | Nudity: Strong | Violence: Mediocre | Mouth-Kiss & Foreplay: Very Strong | Alcohol: Strong | Smoking or Drugs: No" 
" Watch it for its second hour which will shock you with some novel twists and a solid climax.","Vishesh Films are back with the debut of their in-house fresh talent Vishesh Bhatt who thankfully gives us a decent Indianised version of a Spanish Film THE HIDDEN FACE / LA CARA OCULTA which is already there in my list of must watch suspense dramas form the World Cinema. For a change this time Vishesh Films cannot be blamed of making a blatant rip off as MURDER 3 is an official adaptation of its Spanish original with the same producers, Fox Studios backing the project in India too. However since there is no mention of it being an official adaptation in its opening titles (where it should be ideally), so I would like to take it as an "intentional hiding of facts" from the Indian audience by the makers, which was not expected. Having said that, MURDER 3 could have been a landmark film in Indian Cinema, if only the young director had added some kind of clues or engaging moments in its first half. Because in real terms before Interval, MURDER 3 has simply got nothing and post intermission it actually has got everything.To tell you the truth, I even saw few couples moving out of the theater at interval and I personally requested all of them to stay. One of those couples obliged to my request and then especially came forward to say thanks in the end, for not letting them leave the movie in the mid way. Now that was possible only because I had seen the original and very well knew what was coming next which was undoubtedly going to be worth watching for all. But the normal (innocent) audience, not familiar with its original, didn't knew that at all and therefore were all confused at the Interval that what kind of film it is (mystery, horror, or crime- drama) showing no progression of any kind even till its midpoint.So from that point of view MURDER 3 doesn't work at all till its intermission. But post interval it suddenly becomes a shocking eye opener with a never seen before kind of twist in Indian Cinema turning the film into a must watch indeed. To give you an idea, as the characters in the script started revealing their actual truths, all the giggles, casual conversations and phone lights simply went off in the theater resulting in a pin drop silence, rarely found watching a Bollywood film. People literally got stunned with the sudden, wicked twist in the tale in its final 40 minutes giving you a mixed feeling of love, distrust, uneasiness, guilt, anger, revenge or justice. And then with a solid, open but thoughtful climax coming next, everyone couldn't deny watching a good film at last forgetting its avoidable first half.Hence in totality MURDER 3 is a fine attempt by the debutant director Vishesh Bhatt giving you something never offered before in Hindi films. Yes, he majorly follows the original Spanish film sincerely till the added climax, yet the way he conceives his second hour in particular, surely deserves appreciation both from the veterans as well as by the audience unarguably. Another merit of the film is that despite of having few erotic sexual scenes, it doesn't rely on them completely and remains utterly unpredictable in its final hour, resulting in a great emotional suspense drama in the end. Without revealing its basic plot having a great shock value, I would like to add few lines from my short review of the Spanish Original that,"The film has something important to share about the hidden inner psyche of a lover in some sudden or extreme situation. To be precise, every lover in the world has this one thought at the back of his or her mind that in case I die this very moment then would he (she) go for another woman (man)at once, will take some time or will never opt for another one in his (her) entire life."MURDER 3 also talks about this very question in a lover's life but unfortunately its not able to focus on the same in an impressive manner as they did in its original THE HIDDEN FACE. This emotional part of the script comes into the limelight only in the last 35-40 minutes and by that time the viewer is too tired of waiting for something substantial. But still, since this last half an hour remains too good to watch as per the standards of many recent big projects, so one cannot write off the film just like that and has to appreciate the effort truly following the saying, "All is well that ends well".In the musical department, it has few good songs but not any instant hits associated with the brand name of Murder. Raju Singh's background music scores much more than the soundtrack itself as its highly impressive in the sequences revealing the shocking twist. Cinematography is fine capturing the basic essence of the subject and dialogues are just average with nothing path breaking.Performances wise MURDER 3 cannot be rated as a strong film since other than Aditi no one rises above the routine level in the lead roles including Randeep Hooda and Sara. Aditi excels in her portrayal of various emotions in the last hour but Sara only looks beautiful giving the same expressions throughout till the end. However the trio of Rajesh Shringarpure, Shekhar Shukla and Bugs Bhargava make their present felt in their small roles.Finally, it can easily be said that MURDER 3 definitely rises much above the level of its first two parts in comparison. It has a strong plot driven content with an exclusive shock value for the audience and a brilliant climax. So you can surely go for it this weekend, keeping in mind that the film will actually start post intermission." 
" Murder 3 review","In MURDER3, erotica and sensuality which are the prime ingredients of a Bhatt enterprise take a backseat and first time director Vishesh Bhatt experiments with the noir genre through the crevices of infidelity and betrayal.The idea is unoriginal , it's a complete official rip-off of a Columbian movie but the treatment with its unconventional twist and turns makes it a watchable fare.Murder3 picks up momentum only in the post interval portions with some edgy thrills that Vishesh pours in , nevertheless he still has a far way to go when it comes to refined film-making skills. Music has been the forte of this camp and Murder3 satisfies us with its melodious chart-busters.With the plot restricted to the confines of the seemingly haunted house, it still shines with its cinematography and colorful shots. Dialogues have been penned with frivolity and at times appear too funny. Note this , when Randeep is questioned by Sara how he likes to stay in such a godforsaken place , he replies "nature ke kareeb rehna lagta hai mujhe.." and next we see him doing fashion photography with some skimpily clad models ! Of the cast, Randeep Hooda acting stays mediocre and I would say that his potential is still untapped here.Aditi Rao tries hard to look seductive but she falls flat. The actress also definitely needed to put more depth to her character and the way she emotes looks raw.Sara Loren looks glamorous, has the oomph quotient in abundance and she tries to bring some authenticity to her hard-edged character.But the leading ladies fail to create the sizzling chemistry with their hero.Rest of the cast is ignorable.I go with 2.5 out of 5 for Murder 3.It could have worked in a much better way had it been told with an emotional punch and enthusiasm.Regards, Ahwaan" 
" Dafuq bhai? ending ki maa ch*d di","It was going so smooth and suspense was at peak ...then they ruined the ending and left me with wtf?" 
" Murder 3 is a best","I like this kind of storeys.i this is a based on hollywood movie .i dont know but movie and plot was very good.all actors acting are really good" 
" A watchable suspense in the second half","The Bhatt camp has off late done good business with formula movies. 'Murder' series eponymously concerns murder mystery, 'Raaz' that has something to with the supernatural and 'Jism', well the name says it all. One common factor is skin-show and songs that go on to become hits. And there's the Emraan Hashmi factor.First time Director Vishesh Bhatt is believed to have said that their films are "succeeding backwards". True, the quality is depleting but this hasn't really affected their business. So, is this movie a game changer for Bhatt camp or not?An official re-make of the 2011 Spanish film "La cara oculta", the film is about a successful model photographer Vikram (Randeep Hooda) who finds his girlfriend Roshni (Aditi Rao Hydari) suddenly gone missing and the events that follow thereafter. One drunken night in a bar gets Vikram close to a hostess Nisha (Sara Loren) who soon start a romance. But Vikram's house seems to have some dark secrets.The dullest part in the movie is the first half, which seems like a series of songs with a bit of story thrown in and is exceptionally boring. At first we are told how Vikram met Roshni in Cape town, and then dealing with his romance with Nisha. The hero is shown to be living alone in a palatial home on the outskirts of Mumbai. Wondering how on earth did he manage to commute everyday in a self-driven car! Phew!And if you can manage to sit through this for an hour, then comes the surprise! The whole story goes into a different tangent from there on. Although a bit contrived, you soon accept it and flow along with the story. As with any suspense film, you are better off not knowing it till you actually see it. Then, the problem is that, by the time the film starts to get better, it may have alas, lost its audience already.Randeep Hooda, who looks more a goon than an actor makes a sincere attempt to act, in a role where he is brooding and mysterious. The girls on the other hand outshine him. Sara Loren, who earlier made a debut as Mona Lisa in 'Kajraa Re' with Himesh Reshammiya is here with a changed name. And there's Aditi Rao Hydari playing the kind hearted girl who leaves everything behind to travel with her lover to India.The biggest blunder is that the set hardly looks realistic. The home, which we are made to believe that it is from the pre-independence era doesn't remotely look like one. It is difficult to describe the lacunae further without discussing the suspense. Hence, leaving it at this so that you can figure it out. But for their own good the Bhatts need to pull up their socks rather than stay in the 'succeeding backwards' comfort zone.Given the kind of movie that 'Murder 3' is, it is an outright verdict is difficult. If you are looking for Emraan Hashmi style sleaze and songs a la Bhatt camp style, this movie doesn't have those. If are looking for edge-of-the-seat thrills throughout, then look elsewhere. Instead, if you are willing to sit through and daydream till interval time, your immense patience would be rewarded with a watchable suspense." 
" A good thriller to watch","Well, people have said that this movie is inspired by a Spanish movie 'The Hidden face'. However, I did not know about it and was not even expecting much from the movie after the last movie in the murder series. Also the star-cast was unknown to me. Having said that, I was really surprised to see such low ratings for this movie and found it a really good thriller to watch. You can not think of the next twist that is going to happen in the story. Both the actresses are smoking hot and good to watch. The editing is excellent to justify the storyline. Above all I would highly recommend this movie to be watched even with your family. Rating may be low because people may have already known the story to begin with.It is one time great watch."

" A little bad compared to its previous parts.","I love the murder franchise both murder and murder 2 were awesome and especially murder 2 was superb but this part disappoint me little bit.I am not telling that this one is very bad but it's a little slow.The direction was OK.The screenplay locations and dialogues were OK.The acting was good from Randeep hooda.The acting from aditi rao hydari was a little bad.But the songs were really awesome beautiful and lovely.They are ry very good and pleasant to hear.So I can't tell you exactly that you should go for this movie or not.It depends on you if you want to go go or....." 
" Good Movie.. Excellent Direction","At first the movie was interesting with the taste of suspense but looked a bit dumb in the climax while the Vikram(Randeep Singh) cheats on Mona not Roshni... The ending could have been more happy.. Poor Vikram. Also since its a Murder Franchise Emraan Hashmi had to be in the lead role not that Randeep is bad but it would have been more good if Hashmi was a Hero..the role would have definitely suited more better for Hashmi than Randeep. The songs are good.. Teri Jhuki Nazar and Hum Jee lenge. Again i mention Hashmi as the songs will well suit on him. Movie has nail biting thrill.. Good movie must watch.. They don't make such movies anymore.."
