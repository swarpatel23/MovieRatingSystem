" Forget Hello, Just Turn Back","Given the comedic premise (of a womanizing boss harrassing three of his female employees who eventually cook up a plot to teach him a lesson) and the cast which includes talents like Gul Panag, Ishaa Koppikar, Seema Biswas and Divya Dutta, 'Hello Darling' seemed promising. However, it's nothing more than a sorry-ass piece of garbage. I cannot understand why the aforementioned talented women didn't throw the script at the director's face, let alone do the movie. Money couldn't have been the reason as this bad joke of a movie looks very tacky. 'Hello Darling' relies on cheap jokes, sleaziness and the tried and tested formula used in B-grade films. There is practically no story as it can't seem to make up its mind on what it wants to say. While the otherwise talented cast (mentioned above) have been wasted here, non-actors like Celina Jaitley, Chunky Pandey and some unknowns only make 'Hello Darling' cheaper with their cringe-inducing 'acting'. Javed Jaffrey goes over the top as the overly flirtatious boss. This is among the worst of 2010."
