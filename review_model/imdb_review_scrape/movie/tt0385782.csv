" Nice thriller","This was quite a good edge-of-the-seat thriller.  Ashmit Patel gave a decent debut.  Even though the role of the girl opposite him was of a stuck-up, annoying girl, she still seems very annoying.  I guess she fits the role. The main actress had a good debut and carried out her role well.  Songs were great and kept the "suspense feeling."" 
" Flawed script, mediocre film-making, but a decent thriller nonetheless.","I quite enjoyed Vikram Bhatt's Inteha despite its expected flaws. The film is very average in terms of both writing and film-making, it's clich√©, exaggerated, and like almost every other post-2000 Bhatt production -- it's unoriginal. However, despite everything the film was pretty entertaining and the suspense was quite successful in some instances. The main reason the film actually was worth a watch is, first, its music, and secondly, the leading lady, played by the lovely Vidya Malvade. She is a graceful, elegant and beautiful young lady, and though her acting is not great and at several points she overdoes her emotions, she clearly tries her best and as Nandini, the smart, loving and caring elder sister, manages to leave a mark. The same cannot be said about Nauheed Cyrusi, who plays her spoiled younger sister. She is simply annoying and does not convince in any way. Ashmit Patel is expressionless and unimpressive as the bad guy. Anu Malik's soundtrack is fantastic and gives the film a certain charm the script seemed to lack. "Dhalne Lagi Hai Raat", "Yun Hi Dil Ko Agar", "Ab Humse Akele" all are very melodious and fun to listen to. This film is not good, but it's not that bad either, and it may certainly provide a decent watch for the entire family." 
" Can anybody mention the singer and the album name of the English song played at the beginning of the movie? I am most intrigued to get that song.","Can anybody mention the singer and the album name of the English song played at the beginning of the movie? I am most intrigued to get that song. The movie is good combination of thriller and extended family love. A girl keeps her promise made to her dad to safe guard the step sister, even though the step sister disrespects her. Ultimately the story end at the sweet union of both the sisters. I loved it. Songs are good, especially the background English song played at the beginning of the movie.Ashmit Patel played the protagonist which he could have done much better. Nauheed has done really well. Vidya also has done a very good. But somehow it seems they would have done more justice to their roles. Anyhow, the movie is a family movie and can be watched once for good entertainment." 
" Vikram Bhatt's bad days","Vikram Bhatt was known for his thrillers like Kasoor, RAAZ though most are not original yet there were successful. In 2003 his bad days started with Footpath which though quite good was a flop and it was followed by Inteha, which is similar to FEAR and several more Hollywood thrillers. The film wasn't promoted much and sank without a trace. The film starts off well but the love story between Ashmith and Nauheed is far from convincing, The twist is open at the interval but the characterizations are not convincing, Ashmith's character is a question mark, the clues are too convenient and also the back story and the way its revealed leaves a lot to be desired.The snake attack scene looks too stupid and the reason Ashmith asks for sorry looks stupid The climax is typically Bhatt style Direction by Vikram Bhatt is so-so, good in parts Music is okay, Aapke Pyaar Ki is the best song though the placements of most songs seems odd.Ashmith Patel(voice dubbed by Vikram Bhatt) tries hard and is good enough for his debut sadly his career never picked up and he had to go to Big Boss and recently play second fiddle to Salman Khan. Nauheed Cyrusi is wooden while Vidya is superb for her debut though her role is far from convincing, Anjan Shrivastav and others are okay."
