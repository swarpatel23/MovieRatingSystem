" Two people team up to get their loves to have feelings for them in return","This movie started out good and seemed fun and light but then it just starts becoming unbelievable and kind of stupid when Raj and Simran are supposed to get married but reveal to each other that Raj is in love with Asha and Simran is in love with Sameer who "coincidently" happen to be in love with each other. They plot together to ruin Sameer's and Asha's love to get them for themselves with crazy and ridiculous plots that wouldn't work in real life if one had a million dollars. So they ruin the two lives of people just to get with them even though Asha does not love Raj and Sameer does not love Simran. I wont say what happens in the end but I barely made it to end because it just kept getting more and more ridiculous as time went on. I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you like a super cheesy one." 
" Songs tell the story in pleasant romance.","Although this movie was hardly noticed when first released, upon closer inspection it very much deserves to be noticed. It's goal was not to be a flashy super extravaganza, but just a simple romantic story with heart felt songs. What really separates Koi Mere Dil Mein Hai from similarly made movies is the way the songs are handled. Each one is integral to the plot and advances the story nicely. In how many motion pictures can you understand the plot based on the songs alone? Very few. Koi Mere Dil Mein Hai merits a lot of credit for achieving what every musical would like to. While everything about the film is good, the song "Shararati" stands out on a higher level and remains with you long after the film ends. Diya Mirza adds a little something extra to her role and her limited dance steps are top notch. Raj's(Priyanshu)mother, thinking the best way to control his destiny is to have him engaged to his best friend Simran(Diya). Now Simran is an independent soul, and even with the engagement it is a difficult task to get her settled down. The first song, "Koi To Tere Chand Se" introduces us to her as a carefree wealthy flirt who quickly moves from one man to another without any regard to their feelings. The scene takes place for the most part at the seaside. There is some brief dancing, and the song is a nice mild one. In fact all but one of the songs are ballad like. The shift comes with song #2, "Shararati" in which she falls for Sameer(Rakash Bapat), a singer. It's an upbeat, hip song with matching dance numbers. The 1st portion is set at a night club. There's a nice change, and not a slight one, in costumes for the second half of this number. Both Diya and Rakash give this sequence all they've got! Song #3, "Koi Mere Dil Mein Hei" shows us that Raj, at the same time(and after the engagement to Simran), has a new infatuation himself, Asha(Neha) who is tutoring his young sister. For this musical segment there is no real dancing and Raj's parents take part briefly. Both leads sing the same song about their respective new loves. It is a nice pleasant song. With song #4,"Koi To Tere Chand Se" we get a lot more dancing(in fact this is the best dance number in the movie)with the 2 main characters trying to convince the parents, on the dance floor, that everything is going smoothly between them. Of course Simran is hoping Asha is making a lot of headway in order to leave the former free with Sameer. Their jovial deceit makes this an engaging sequence and it is Priyanshu's best. Song #5 relates that with the time that they are separated, Raj and Simran begin to miss each other and wonder if they've made the right decision after all. Simran, surprisingly, is the 1st to realize her mistake. There is more music than song here, with some dialogue and flashbacks. The old standby rainfall scene is in evidence as well. The next song, "Na Dil Ko Lagate Na" is the most romantic with a deliberate slow pace. It sets the mood for heartache as relationships end, with not everyone in agreement. Once again, no dancing is involved. The last song(which doesn't give the ending away) "Baahon Mein Nahin Rehna" is where Raj and Simran have made up their minds to be married and both convey their happiness. There is, rightfully so, some dancing, Raj plays the saxophone by the poolside and both dive in for a momentary swim. Sameer, though, hasn't quite given up on Simran and is ready to go to any length to get her back! The one fault perhaps in KMDMH is that Neha has less to do in the musical segments than the other 3 stars, but still and all it is a romance movie that is quite effective."
