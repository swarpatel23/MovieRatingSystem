" Excellent piece of work","Jordan is sitting among prostitutes and strumming his guitar as they sing together -- when his manager pulls him out onto the street. Soon, a crowd engulfs them and starts chanting Jordan's name, their voices drowning the sound of the manager pleading with the musician to get his act together. "This is what I have always wanted," Jordan says, looking at his screaming fans. "But I am not happy inside."Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar is a bittersweet journey of a man, an artist, from being an everyman to a superstar. But while Ali uncovers layers off Jordan the iconic musician -- each layer as fascinating as it is intriguing -- he keeps the core of the character, Janardhan Jakkad, alive. He hurts like anybody else, falls in love like anybody else, and also has to deal with moments of sheer frustration.And all of it finds release in music. Music is Jordan's identity; it's what makes him rich and famous. But to Jordan, that's incidental. In the end, his artistry is what connects him with himself. For a Hindi film viewer, that is a fascinating story to watch unfold.Then there's the opening shot, a tribute to India's original Rockstar, Shammi Kapoor. From there on, it's a tumultuous ride – one with its highs and lows, one that has anguish as also love, one that has pain, but also a sense of fulfillment. And a brilliant finale -- not a conventional one, but effective nonetheless -- which leaves you feeling like the characters themselves: incomplete but content, like an effective crescendo that leaves you wanting more.The music itself is a delight. Each AR Rahman number is lilting, and woven beautifully in the story, the high frequency of songs not hindering the storytelling but enhancing the experience. Lyricist Irshad Kamil does an outstanding job, penning words that reflect the lead character's state of mind and complement situations aptly.Imtiaz Ali, in trademark fashion though, isn't content with Focussing on the complexities of a troubled musician; he gives us a dose of romance too, and a generous one at that. Estrangement from family, lack of fulfillment in life, and self-discovery apart, what really drives Jordan's music is his relationship with Heer (Fakhri, beautiful but awkward). Volatile as the affair is, it's also what keeps Jordan sane, and Heer alive.For about 15 minutes in Rockstar, the narrative tends to resort to 'Bollywoodism'; true love having the power to cure a terminal illness (almost), for example, doesn't exactly fit with what the rest of the film has to say. The story tends to meander a bit post-interval, but Imtiaz makes it work eventually, interweaving the fantastical romantic part of the film with the more gritty, dark bits deftly. In the end, how much you enjoy Rockstar will largely depend on whether the balance between the tale of a broken, discontented musician and the more conventional love story works for you.It did for me -- though I would have preferred the former -- but you can't deny Imtiaz credit for his mastery over the romance genre. No contemporary filmmaker has dealt with man-woman relationships with as much dexterity. His films often tread a similar path (the lovers are usually confused, meet at different points in life, and there's always the 'other man'), but his fresh approach to each story is what makes them immensely watchable.With Rockstar, Imtiaz goes beyond his own tried-and-tested format, his ambition to narrating a more complex story coming through. This is probably his most personal film, and his honesty as filmmaker is hard not to be affected by. Hopefully, he goes the whole hog next, ditching the genre he's adept at to trying his hand at something entirely out of his comfort zone. Rockstar is also Imtiaz's most technically polished film, and he benefits from the association with cinematographer Anil Mehta and editor Aarti Bajaj.Ranbir Kapoor has been Hindi cinema's Next Big Thing for a while now. With Rockstar, he lives up to the hopes pinned on him to deliver big. Ranbir revels in Jordan's complexities; another actor may have found it to be an obstacle. The character arc undergoes constant transformation and he adapts suitably. It wouldn't be an understatement to say that Ranbir's portrayal of Jordan may go down as one of Hindi cinema's most accomplished performances by a lead actor. Just to see him work his magic on screen, Rockstar is worth a watch.But while good acting is always an incentive, it's a director's vision that makes a film truly watchable, and Imtiaz makes Rockstar stand out from what the mainstream churns out every week. And brings back the one aspect sorely missing from Hindi films lately -- music." 
" No words for describing it...","Rockstar is a film made once in a lifetime. Hats off to Imtiaz Ali for story, Ranbir Kapoor & Nargis Farkhri for scintillating performances, A.R. Rahman & Mohit Chauhan for great soundtrack & background Music.Rockstar is a must watch film. It'll leave you feel-good hangover of itself. This Movie shows how Love Stories should be made. This movie has something, which is hard to see in other Hindi/Bollywood Films. Something which would make you think about the whole movie even after so many hours of watching it. Watch it deeply and you'll enjoy it.I loved the movie and enjoyed it thoroughly after so watching so many movies this year, I'd say Watch it Again, if you've seen it once...Verdict: Don't Miss it!!!Acting & Performance: 9/10Story: 8.5/10Music: 10/10Overall: 9/10" 
" Honest","Not every movie needs to have tadka, it's a movie which is pure from heart and honest. It doesn't speak about anything other than attraction which can't be explained.Sure it has it's flaws but if you can look over them and watch it with a warm heart, it stays with you well after you have left the theater. Hats off to Imtiaz Ali for daring to break the shell. Jab we met was fun to watch and a good movie, but Rockstar shows how much depth can be reached in a romantic movie without even saying the L word even once.Everything said, watch it if you appreciate good cinema and not because you are looking for a stereotypical complete Bollywood package." 
" one of India's successful attempts at making a movie even Hollywood should learn from!","one of the best movies i've ever seen and imtiaz alis best so far...really.. i always admired him as a director..and this movie , though has glimpses of his previous films that were super hits - love aajkal and jab we met but the second half is totally offbeat and different yet really refreshing. the screenplay is like one i have never seen before...just like an a grade English movie... a lot of people have criticized this movie, unable to understand the way imtiaz has told this story. what a beautiful love story... i'd say, don't go for this movie expecting a love aajkal or jab we met. . keep a free mind and enjoy imtiaz's fresh way of showing you some love!!" 
" An emotional and powerful journey.","Even though the Indian film Industry releases countless big budget films every year, only once in a while there comes a movie like "Rockstar" which moves away from the usual story and casts an impression on the viewers.Imtiaz Ali has created such a masterpiece this time. His story is a fresh take on romance and pain and he has shown he is one of the best directors around.The story revolves around 2 characters Janardhan Jakhar a.k.a Jordan(Ranbir Kapoor) and Heer(Nargis Fakri) and their feelings towards each other. The special thing about this movie is that despite being a love story, the lead characters never act as the clichéd lovers..they never said "I love you" throughout the movie and still their love was so intense and powerful..The self inflicted pain of 'Jordan' is the soul of this movie and moves the audience.Ranbir has done a remarkable act and has again proved he is an exceptional actor in the film industry. His transition from the innocent and confused 'JJ' to the ruthless, shattered 'Jordan' is flawless. The audience were in awe of him throughout the movie and rightly so.The music blends with this movie perfectly and most of the time lifts the movie to higher levels. The voice of Mohit Chauhan along with the expertise of AR Rahman is just superb and this duo will be in demand for a long time. The joy, enlightenment, pain and suffering of 'Jordan' is portrayed very well through the songs. And this is one of those movies in which you feel that the songs weren't just forced in the story.Despite everything being so good there was one shortcoming, Nargis. The model turned actress had weird expressions in few scenes in her debut film. This created some funny moments in the first half but she did a convincing act post interval.One thing which the director couldn't balance was the pace..The first half was expanded into few years showing the pair's love and relationship but post interval they didn't do that, and stuck to a straight and small period with longer scenes. This gave most of the general audience an idea that it was slow. If the story in between intervals was balanced in terms of the time span, more people would have appreciated the whole movie.This an emotional, and an intense journey of a simple man who goes on a path of self destruction. A Must Watch, this movie needs deep understanding and appreciation." 
" A New Star Is Born - RockStar","First of all, Rockstar is not a mere love story, for those people I saw drawing conclusion that this is just an extramarital affair which is justified by Imtiaz Ali, it's much more than that.When the character of protagonist was getting built, it was told to him that it would be pain that would get the star out of him; movie is journey of making of a Rock star who goes through pain of separation, depravity from society which makes him someone he was never meant to be but finally a Rockstar. A true blue eyed boy who was always away from any sense of pain in his life until he falls in love and tore apart life of his and love of his life Heer.I am although not a big Rock music fan but got food for thought for those posthumous rock stars that lost their lives to depression and drugs. This film gives gray shades of their tainted life which is always open to so much of public scrutiny which perhaps helped me to recon with their hysterical behavior.It starts with a young lad trying to make big in music but who doesn't have soul to sell himself as a serious artist. He has shown a way through love and betrayal and he fancies his chances with the most admired girl of the town, little does he know that this would embark an endless journey of pain for both which would see it's penultimate end being both leads battling for their survival literally.I don't wish to discuss movie dynamics in length as this is not about how the script has been written with/without conviction. The real sense of conviction in this movie comes through Ranbir Kapoor, he lives the character of Jordan and gives performance of his life time. Not in for a second you would think for the entire movie that he is a movie star, you would watch him struggle through his pathos. Kudos to him for pulling this off with such great ease, I couldn't imagine anyone doing this role and leave the same impression. Nargis who is the leading lady in this movie, looks no less than an angel in movie and gives a performance for which any new comer can feel proud about especially against such a strong character played by Ranbir Kapoor.Of all the loudest praise should go to two people, A.R. Rehman for his genius music and to Mohit Chauhan, this movie is as much a milestone for him as it is for Ranbir Kapoor. Both Mohit and Ranbir jells so well that it's hard to believe that actually Ranbir's voice is backed by a singer, it's a compliment for both of them. Every song stands out and they all are superb.I thoroughly enjoyed this journey of making of a Rock star. This movie is not about making a right statement to society and not to follow the footsteps of protagonist; it's about how much pain it goes in making a real Rock star that makes everyone feel on the cloud when he couldn't ground his foot correctly. Movie is dark in nature and this is about an anti hero Jordan who don't have sense of righteousness and he vents out his anger in form of music, a picture perfect depiction of a rebel Rock star to the core.Watch it, if you are in for dark movies. Don't expect any Bollywood masala but an intense tide of emotions throughout." 
" 'Rockstar' leaves you with a feel-good hangover of itself, that is hard to digest at first watch.","Love stories have always been Bollywood's thing. A trifle here and there might have changed over the years, but the formulaic love story, the one that we've all grown up on and savored, always takes you by the hand, guides you through the film's ups and downs and leaves you at an ending. But when you have a story as new, as fresh and as free-falling as the one in Imtiaz Ali's 'Rockstar', then these are times that herald a new change in today's Bollywood.The story goes something like this. Janardhan Jakkad(JJ a.k.a Jordan), a Delhi simpleton, has always wanted to be a rockstar. His friend/mentor and college canteen manager, Khatana, gives him a 'get-your-heart-broken-and-you-will-be-a-rockstar' solution. JJ automatically aims for the prettiest chick on campus, Heer, sure to have his heart broken. But what follows is a story that goes from a simple one of fame-mongering to a love story most unusual. The chapter of Jordan and Heer never seems to end and their complexities take them on a path that would ultimately destroy their lives.It is very difficult to characterize the movie with a single emotion. It is so beautifully layered that it will take repeated viewings to form a consensus within yourself as to WHY you love the film. Just like its soundtrack, 'Rockstar' is a movie you will have to allow to grow on you. The film can best be described as a heady cocktail of love and fame and how each has an effect on the other. It's the free-falling nature of the story that gives it a feeling never before experienced in Indian cinema. The movie borders on self-indulgence every once in a while but wonderfully balances it out with realism.The music, composed by A.R. Rahman, is in many ways a character in the film. Every phase of Jordan's life is characterized by a song which magically sets the tone for the next few minutes, till the next song or sequence comes along and changes the mood. The music, in many ways, drives the film. Its very obvious now why Imtiaz Ali replaced usual collaborator Pritam with Rahman. Without the type and scale of the music Rahman has given for this film, 'Rockstar' would have been very handicapped. The music truly forms the soul of the film. Also, from the snow covered mountains of Kashmir and Himachal and the dingy discotheques to the old-architecture of Prague and the various concert venues, the film looks beautiful in almost every shot, thanks to ace cinematographer Anil Mehta. The right variations in angle, color and focus gives the film a biographical feel where the scenes portray an emotion as much as the actors in them do.Which brings me to the performances. The film has few characters and each of them are well-defined. Aditi Rao plays the journalist Sheena, who tracks Jordan's life and though she has precious little to do, she plays her part. Piyush Mishra as the shrewd record company owner Dhingra, is the quintessential greedy man in the film and does well too. Kumud Mishra as Khatana, Jordan's old friend and manager is perfect and brings in a certain sincerity and authenticity to his part. Shammi Kapoor as the shehnai maestro Ustad Jameel Khan is absolutely charming every time he appears on screen. It is hard to miss the glint in his eye and these being his last shots, will always be what 'Rockstar' will be remembered for. Now for the two lead actors. Nargis Fakri is unfortunately, the weakest link in the film. She obviously has a lot to learn in the acting department. She blatantly disappoints in scenes where she is required to do more than just look pretty, and ends up as the cold dish in 'Rockstar'. Nonetheless, she does look good in every frame and with better acting, could go places. With her current form, she will find it tough to make a mark.However, 'Rockstar' completely belongs to Ranbir Kapoor, who has clearly gives this film his all. He plays his part with utmost perfection and with a depth that is so rare in Bollywood these days. Through the film, it is Jordan, and not Ranbir Kapoor, that we see on screen. He earnestly brings out the character transition from JJ to Jordan with such ease, that this could very well be his career-defining performance. He's clearly left his contemporaries WAY behind. Ranbir Kapoor, as of now, owns Bollywood.Having dared to make such an experimental film, director Imtiaz Ali is truly the new-age doyen of Indian Cinema. His refreshing take on love stories, from 'Jab We Met' to 'Love Aaj Kal', continues with 'Rockstar' which will be remembered for a long time as the first movie of its kind. Truly original and truly inspired from all the right sources, Imtiaz Ali is the new age phenomenon of modern love in cinema.Truly magical and spell-binding, 'Rockstar' leaves you with a feel-good hangover of itself, that is hard to digest at first watch. I'd give it a 4/5.Don't miss." 
" Not at all made for unintellectual viewers.Intensified.Exemplary.","Pros:Abrupt start and unfinished end,always catchy!Love,attraction,passion,pain,loss,destruction-everything in a pack.Movie includes flashbacks and frames so nicely arranged,that story always remains on track and with ease. Supporting casts are so in script,no any distraction or out of track leads. Raw footage beautifies the movie,editing is nicely done and skipped. Ranbir-Nargis chemistry is uncommonly beautiful. Songs are sung outstandingly by Mohit Chauhan and performed equally well by Ranbir.Made for each other duo. Lyrics are inseparable from situation,really well written. Cons:Nargis is overwhelmingly beautiful but utterly noob while acting.--------- Not many directors could have justified the script like Imtiaz Ali.Music couldn't have been better than by the Academy award winner A.R.Rehman,it takes you to out of world.and Ranbir Kapoor,real rockstar from the movie has shown that,he is ready to make the bollywood biggies insecure. Outstanding movie!!!above the average of bollywood." 
" Ranbir's stellar performance nearly makes up for the movie's flaws","Even if you ignore his surname for a moment, Ranbir Kapoor is arguably one of the most naturally talented actors in today's Bollywood. In addition to this, his good looks ensure female fan following, read: rake in more moolah. His 'Rockstar' may have just been his most intense and splendid performance till date. 'Rockstar' begins at a concert in Rome and someone scuffling with ruffians. It is soon revealed that the 'someone' is Jordan, a major rockstar, labeled a bad-boy by the media and someone who hardly smiles. Cut to his college days, there's the simple Janardan Jahkar or JJ strumming his guitar and singing for the local audience and his days in the college canteen gorging samosas and idolizing Jim Morrison.When his well-wisher and canteen manager Katana, played impressively by Kumud Mishra tells him that a true artist needs to be driven by hurt and anguish, JJ curses his simple and incident-free life. Just to get his heart broken, he chases the college bombshell, Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri). Eventually, it turns out that under the prim and proper exterior Heer is thrill-seeker and the two become wild friends. What begins as a fun-filled friendship takes different shades as the time passes. On one hand, Heer drowns into depression without our hero, whom she re-christens as 'Jordan'. And, Jordan's yearning for her company brings out the performer in him.In what is probably the best portrayal of what goes on in a creative head, the story brings depth and makes its audience feel for JJ. Despite the negative publicity he gets as Jordan, he's a simple guy who yearns for love. Noticeably, it is only after his tryst with Heer that his motive in life changes from chasing success to something else. During the process, success merely becomes a byproduct he is least interested in. Director Imtiaz Ali plays around with the story's chronology. It is likely that the editors too may have actually lost track in between. Repeated scenes, songs and too much of flash-back or forth gets annoying after a point. The restlessness among the audience was very apparent as the movie seemed to go on forever. Talking of performances, Ranbir surely has a line of awards waiting for him. Nargis Fakhri, the American with Pakistani antecedents who plays the leading lady is truly beautiful and has been a Kingfisher calendar girl; but not as gifted with acting skills. The film also marks Shammi Kapoor's last screen appearance as he plays an Ustaad who recognizes JJ's talent. Aditi Rao Hydari plays a small role as a Journalist.AR Rahman's music is integral to the story and songs have already become runaway hits. 'Sadda Haq', 'Kun Faya Kun', 'Jo Bhi Main', with Mohit Chauhan as the Rockstar's voice and 'Katiya Karun' give the album an eclectic blend of rock, desi flavor and Sufi mysticism. Again, some more awards are in the waiting here.Cinematography too is well done, especially the jerky shots and quirky angles that capture the actors' emotions effectively. Be it the by lanes of Delhi, picturesque Europe or Breathtaking beautiful Kashmir winter, the excellence with the camera is undeniable. The realistic costumes complement the camera work. The dialog is very smart and the first half evokes laughter and stands up ably as things turn serious in the second half. You may blame the script for some of its flaws, but asking for perfection when portraying emotions and out of the ordinary relationships is a monumental challenge. So, to say, it's a job moderately well done.So, should you be watching this movie? The answer is a resounding 'Yes'! Granted, the story gets a little lost in the second half, but the rest of the goodies will make you overlook its flaws. The movie is powerful enough to keep you thinking much after you are out of the movie hall. If you still haven't seen it, go for it!" 
" An awesome piece of Art by Imtiaz Ali","Indian cinema has matured and specially Hindi film with new directors pouring in with new ideas. Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee, Vishal Bhardwaj should get special mention for their brilliant coming of age films. After Rockstar, Imtiaz Ali should be added to this category of filmmakers. Romantic cinema is immortal perennial but never ever it has been witnessed in such creative, symbolic, real manner as in Rockstar. Rockstar is journey of Janarthan, a regular north Delhi brat who dreams of becoming Jim Morrison. He even tries to match his initials with the famous singer and tries to change his fate. Alas! He couldn't succeed in making a mark when a college canteen owner (who becomes family for Janarthan later on) Khataria tells him that through pain comes music. Janarthan took his word too seriously thus involving in a web of suffering and success all revolving around Heer, a lady who becomes life for Janarthan rather Jordan. The movie is a journey of a young ambitious boy from his being Janarthan to Jordan and in a symbolic manner raises several questions about independence and democracy. Imtiaz Ali is a fabulous story teller and his previous work reflects those but with Rockstar he goes a level higher. The film will bring polarizing reactions from cine goers but they can't ignore it. Probably one of the best romantic cinemas ever made. Ali is almost flawless in his execution. With a semi non-linear narrative Ali goes into the psyche of Jordan merging his scenario pre and post success. The scene where Jordan cries in front of Khataria that he doesn't need all the fame he wants to be Happy – sums up Jordan's strive with his impression. The rebel has been created in a thought provoking manner raising questions to establishment. The rules set in the society, the willingness to live freely, how power has destroyed the regular course of nature – all these ideas have been embedded subtle in a brilliant love story that is natural unlike loud melodramatic blockbusters of regular Hindi cinema. When Jordan is almost losing Heer forever there is a scene which shows Jordan in a bath tub looking at his guitar on fire which reflects the life of present youth who tends to burn (loss) everything one loves in course of success. There are many more such brilliant sequences which show Ali's craftsmanship as a director. With able support from Anil Mehta the camera work is probably the best of this year. Ali didn't compromise for commerce and gave a surreal feel to the real proceedings. Kudos to Aarti Bajaj for her apt editing and making the film a work of art. Coming to the acting department, Ranbir Kapoor rocks. He camouflaged himself as Jordan with élan. Rockstar will prove how fine actor he is. In fact the new brigade of actors should take acting lessons from Ranbir. Watch his transition from Janarthan to Jordan, his success his failures his love his despair – Ranbir's expression deserves awards and accolades. Teaming up with fabulous actors like Piyush Mishra, Kumud Mishra (who was last seen in brilliant "That girl in yellow boots") Ranbir showed extreme maturity. In a sequence where he tore down a contract and made hysteric gestures towards Piyush Mishra deserves standing ovation. Those dialogues showing Ali's angst against consumerism deserves mention. Nargis Fakhri as Heer is serene beauty. Any boy will fall in love with her. As an actress she needs to improve but then she isn't bad either. Piyush Mishra as the opportunist Dhingra simply rocks as usual. Kumud Mishra is surely to catch attention of other directors. The ensemble cast provides ample support in their brief and significant role. Lastly how can one forget the original Rockstar Late Shammi Kapoor in a significant appearance. As a successful classical Sahnai (flute) player he is mind blowing. And how can I forget about Rehman's music in the film. Each of the songs are mark of a genius and brilliant in their own space. With awesome lyrics from Irshad Kamil the musical score elevates the movie to another level. "Nadan parinday" is one of the best written songs of recent times and "Sadda Haq" had all the power to be the youth anthem. Simply brilliant album in every sense. Overall Rockstar is a outstanding work of art that might not appeal to every many but sure to be the next Kagaz ke Phool in the long run; though Rockstar is already a Hit. Thankfully a genuine honest effort deserved its box office report. A classic in the long runRockstar Rocks!!" 
" Rockstar - An amazing love story---Saddaaaaaaa Haqqqqqqq","JJ aka JORDAN / Ranbir Kapoor Rocks.....Saddaaaaaaaa Haqqqq......Loved Rockstar movie a lotttttttttt......From Screenplay to story or Direction to Music N above all acting from the all the character is like mind-blowing ...........Will be watching it again tomorrow...This is not a feel good movie and I know a lot of people will not like it but yes it will make you think even after the lights are on.....This movie is the best film of 2011....RK is amazing and ARR score rocks....Deserves all major awards....OVERALL AN OUTSTANDING FILM which is connected to most of us...Rating 9/10....oh ya ya ya y...o yaaaaaaa....." 
" Typical Imtiaz Ali style movie","For me it was the most awaited movie for this year, especially after listening to the awesome songs. First of all the music, Rehman and Irshad Kamil did fabulously well. The music and songs were totally different from the regular bollywood style.Ranbir was terrific and this was truly his best performance till date. He looked so natural that sometimes you feel that you are watching a live shot documentary or something.Imtiaz Ali's direction as always was very good. He has a different style of making movies and this movie is a great example of that. Though my personal favorite from his lot is Love Aaj Kal.The only loose part in the movie was Nargis. She was not up to the mark and some very good scenes and situations got spoiled because of her poor acting skills. And especially when pitted against the flawless Ranbir she looks pathetic to say the least. So, without disclosing anything from the story I'd say its a great movie and you surely can't afford to miss it." 
" Nice Musical Movie Imtiaz Ali and A.R. Rehmaan is best.","After seeing Trailer Movie looking like as old movies of Ranbir but this movie is surprise package for me. Great acting and great music with nice lyrics...Story as like old movies of Imtiaz Ali nice and different.....people are telling confusing might they don't have enough understanding.:)Music is awesome..A.R. Rehman is best...Lyrics is also good.Best acting of Ranbir with awesome look of ROCKSTAR Nargis is looking good but acting is OK... Shammi have very short role, we can remember as a last movie of himAlready watched 1 time bur wanna going for more times... Must watch Movie go and see..." 
" It is about a young successful musician how he become successful along with ups n down in love.","Ranbir is committed in his disturbed Desi rocker avatar and his abstention from any intoxicants makes him an idol who wouldn't corrupt his worshipers. Nargis blends divine beauty with lips that jive like she's in the movie, 'Finding Nemo'.Watching 'Rockstar' once is like watching it many times over, thanks to the repeated montages that sporadically recap the film. If you thought being stabbed once was bad, here's what a knife set can do.The film drives home an unscientific hypothesis that people who've endured sufferings/ heart break/ loose motions etc will reach their creative best. By this logic, each person in the audience will be blessed with superhuman creativity as they step out after watching 'Rockstar'. Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! go n watch out u cant miss :D :D" 
" Imtiaz Ali Best!!!! The real way how love story should be made.","This is seriously Imtiaz's Best film yet!!!! When the movie end, i kept asking myself how is it possible to narrate a story like this... Story wise, absolutely amazing!!! What you guys will see in the trailer is just 1% of the movie!!!! Ranbir Kapoor was amazing too, balancing the right emotions at the right time. Some Amards should be waiting for him now... definitely AR Rahman stole the whole movie with 14 Top charting music!!!! Every Music suits the story every single time. Well he isn't called genius without a reason.For me, its the Best Album of the year and potentially the best movie if the year!!!! All Credits goes to Imtiaz Ali for such great story/content." 
" Un-Indianised, simply brilliant","Lately i have had to go through the trauma of watching some rubbish, money motivated Bollywood flicks such as the prolonged "bodyguard" and the hideously scripted "Ra-One".However, Rock-star is just on another level. It is the most gripping Bollywood film of the year. It reminds me of movies like "Rock on", "Dil Chahta hai", "Rang de Basanti". Because this like them is not a clichéd story, it is out of the box and very very different from the monotonous chocolate-love flicks.The best part of the movie was that there were no non-sense songs, all the songs made sense and were perfectly timed. The music by A.R Rehman is absolutely brilliant. Apart from that, it is very well directed, the way the director has played with the time-line is marvelous. The time-line keeps the viewer glued to the screen. For instance, the start of the movie is showing JJ or Jordan at a massive concert and then suddenly you see him as a struggling visionary artist during his college life trying to imitate famous Rock-stars.Yes, the movie basically is a love story, but an extremely gripping one unlike most Bollywood love stories. You see how Jordan becomes the star he is, due to this love story. That is what makes it so special, 2 plots working side by side complementing one another i,e him becoming a "star" due to his passionate "love affair".The facial expressions of both "Ranbir" and "Nargis" add to the spice. You actually feel they are in love. The intensity of their relationship is very evident due to the acting. Nargis despite not having her own voice has done an outstanding job and Ranbir Kapoor has stepped up a notch from his other brilliant performance in "Rajneeti".It is one of those epic movies, you cant afford to miss. If you are a fan of wonderfully scripted biographies then this one is definitely for you. However if you enjoy over the top action, stunts or illogical comedy then don't watch it.My recommendation to all purists out there, do watch it. I cant believe the rating of this movie is only 7.6 which is most likely to drop.Through all this i have learned one thing, Through this movie the Indian cinema has shown signs of maturity however through the rating the public has not.Ranbir Kapoor and Nargis take a bow !! extremely brilliant performance !"
