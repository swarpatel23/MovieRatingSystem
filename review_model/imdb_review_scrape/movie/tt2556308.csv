" A Spectacular Film! (I mean it)","Akshay Kumar is an amazing actor. His stunts are jaw breaking no doubt. But, the film hits the write notes. Sonakshi Sinha was wasted. Freddy Daruwala makes a god villain. This is an edge of the seat thrilled that will keep you hooked right till the end!It's just as hard to imagine "Holiday" without Akshay as it is to imagine last week's elegiac and thoughtful "Citylights" without Rajkummar Rao.They both breathe life into their characters from different respiratory systems.We often tend to think the grammar and language of mainstream cinema to be far easier to convey than the language of the so-called serious cinema.Wrong! A full-on massy product, which doesn't resort to outlandish inanities or outright vulgarity, is the most difficult form of filmmaking. In "Holiday", Murugadoss has some absolutely unflinching support from his writers and technicians, all out to create that increasingly elusive cinematic entity .The perfect entertainer.Not that "Holiday" is not without its flaws. What would life in the movies be without those?Sonakshi Sinha's role and presence in the plot can at best be termed as comic relief. She is less diva, more Mehmood. It is interesting to see how the director weaves the romantic element into what is predominantly a rugged man-to-man confrontation between an armyman on leave and a super-intelligent terrorist, who is seen to work out not from a dingy warehouse, but a normal home teeming with the scents and images of domestic harmony." 
" Movie Review - Holiday: A soldier is never off duty","Akshay Kumar is back after his last dud "Boss" and back with the two genres he does best, Action and Comedy."Holiday: A soldier is never off duty" is an interesting take on the unexplored subject of Sleeper Cells. The plot is interesting and is executed well by the director. It is a refreshing dispatch from the usual films made on The Indian Army. The film is triggered when Captain Virat Bakshi played by Akshay Kumar, intelligently stops 12 serial blasts with his team. Thus ensues a cat and mouse game between the sleeper cell head played by Freddy Daruwala and Captain Virat Bakshi.The music is not up to the mark and the romance between Akshay and Sonakshi gives a few light moments. The chemistry between Sumeet Raghavan and Akshay Kumar is better than that between Akshay and Sonakshi. Sumeet Raghavan gives a good performance among the cast. Freddy Daruwala as the antagonist fails to leave an impression but the film is carried beautifully by Akshay Kumar who gives a superlative performance. He throws himself into the action sequences and performs them excellently, he has spot on comic timing and also gives a restrained performance when he is needed to. The actor is in top form here. Sonakshi Sinha doesn't have much scope.Overall, "Holiday: A soldier is never off duty" is worth a watch for its novel concept and makes one stand and salute the Indian Army. Go Watch IT!" 
" Must Watch Movie of 2014","Holiday – A Soldier story turns into a full-time action mission to save Mumbai from terror attacks. The one man army that he is, he takes it upon himself to man up and save the city from this mayhem. The whole plot of the movie is compelling and finely directed by one of the finest director Murgadoss who gave us Gajini. Akshay's stunts are jaw – dropping and he's in top form and impressively leads the show. Finally Holiday is fierce and it leaves you clutching to the edge of your seat plenty of times. The climax is a spectacle to watch.The movie will keep you hooked to your seat till the end. Finally a role that Akshay Kumar should take up in all his forthcoming movie. Go watch, its a sure shot winner at the box office." 
" Tu suspense mein maar.... One of Akshay's best acts, and Brilliant ACTION/THRILL!!!!","An action packed tale, the story begins with Virat Bakshi (akshay) a captain with the Indian army and he comes to Mumbai for holidays. He is taken to see Sahiba (sonakshi) for alliance but he rejects her but eventually he sees another side in her which attracts him. The story takes a turn when a bomb blast occurs in Mumbai. Virat starts his hunt to chase the culprits and catches one of them only to discover that there are more of such bombs in the city. How Virat goes about tracking the other bombs and the people behind it form the rest of the story.The director has come up with a thrilling storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was taut. The dialogues were energy filled, the script was tight and the screenplay was great and fast paced. Background score was strong and two songs were melodious. Cinematography was masterly. Editing was sharp. Costumes were trendy and youthful while the art department was natural. Akshay Kumar looks suave and carries off his role with good style.It would not be wrong to say that in Holiday Akshay has given one of his career best performances.Watch out for his action scenes, he proves there is no one better, he blows your mind in the action scenes. Sonakshi Sinha looks pretty and sexy wherever required. Govinda gave many laughs. Same goes with Sumeet Raghavan. Freddy Daruwala was perfect as the baddie. Aackruti Nagpal looks hot. The others did their bit as required.The film is a remake of the Tamil super hit 'Thuppakki' made by Murugadoss himself. The first half is filled with elements of suspense,thrill,comedy, romance, songs and some action. The second half is were the films hits the excellence peak.Its adrenaline filled with some of the best action scenes, seen in bollywood and a little patriotic angle.Overall, this is Bollywood's best film so far in 2014, AR Murgadoos has proved after Ghajini again why he is so loved in the south. He makes a taut sleek action thriller, which has a little bit of masala so that audience is fully entertained. The film is a must watch just to see the amazing action, and to see Akshay Kumar at his best, he will leave speechless in the climax.Tu suspense mein maar.... One of his best acts ever. Blockbuster!!!!" 
" #Holiday Another Supehit from Akshay Kumar","From a Akshay Kumar flick you expect action, comedy, romance, thrills and the movie as promised. As Capt. Virat Bakshi, he challenges the sleeper cell network hidden in the city, while romancing his lady love Saiba (Sonakshi Sinah) and placing everything including his family at stake. A movie dedicated to all our country's soldiers and their sacrifices, this movie unlike any other throws light on terrorism and the selfless act in any soldier.Songs have catchy tunes by Pritam and location of songs are very fresh.The movie is a definite must watch and make sure you have a tub of popcorn for every tantalizing twist the movie offers!" 
" Akshay Kumar steals the show","Holiday - A Solider Never Off Duty, an Akshay Kumar show all the way... On leave from the Indian Army, Virat Bakshi (Akshay Kumar) is bride hunting and meets Sahiba (Sonakshi Sinha). Along with his cop buddy (Sumeet Raghavan) he catches a terrorist who is part of a sleeper cell. From then on, he is engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with a terror mastermind (Freddy Daruwala).Firstly thank god Akshay Kumar has not done his stereotypical over the top comic act here. Akshay Kumar is probably one of the best action stars Bollywood has ever seen and he reminds us again why he is on the top of list. His character in Holiday is serious, smart, calm & composed. Somewhere in the film he reminded me of Special 26's Arjun. He steals each & every moment of the film. It's a treat to watch him in this avatar. It's difficult to imagine anyone else in the role. He sinks deep into the character of an army man. It feels like the role was tailor made for him. With this film he shows how versatile as an actor he is. I wish he chooses these types of roles over those so called "entertaining" & "comic" ones.Why on earth (read Bollywood) do we need a heroine in a film like this? Sonakshi Sinha is one big flaw in Holiday. She irritates the viewers at regular intervals just like Kajal Agarwal did in Special 26 or more than her. She is like those commercial breaks which come during a nail- bitting cricket match. The romantic track between her and Akshay Kumar & the songs could've easily been chopped off from the film. This would make Holiday more interesting to watch.Debutant Freddy Daruwala tries hard to be Vidyut Jamwal of Force but doesn't create much of an impact. Sumeet Raghavan plays his part perfectly. Govida's cameo was entertaining but was needless in the film. Despite there being several loopholes in the script director A.R. Murgadoss manages to keep the audiences glued to their seats throughout the movie excluding songs & the romantic angle. The film's story is nice especially the second hour. Also the film could've easily edited by 15- 20 minutes.The scene where Akshay Kumar rescues girl hostages is the highlight of the movie. A special mention for the action director Greg Powell for doing a wonderful job. I'll rate it 7/10. Holiday has flaws but is an enjoyable flick. Akshay Kumar takes the film to another level. Even non Akshay Kumar fans will love him in this avatar. Holiday A Soldier Never Off Duty is for both, classes & masses." 
" Great flick","Holiday delivers thrilling scenes with relish and energy. It is a slick Action thriller that keeps you engrossed, enthralled and captivated all through, thanks to its fascinating premise and a watertight, sharp Screenplay. Holiday' is one film that will be liked by both the masses and the classes equally. It's sheer brilliance. It's fierce and it leaves you clutching to the edge of your seat plenty of times. The absorbing pace of the movie, the intelligent thinking of the proceedings, and Akshay Kumar gratuitous action sequences wins the show. Holiday is mostly a delectable film. This is Akshay Kumar's most engaging entertainer in recent times." 
" Akshay Kumar action as usual with good story","Another hit by Akshay Kumar. the film is all about some real action and good story. Akshay has played different role in this similar to special 26 rather than his roles like boss. the movie is around a soldier who on holiday but gets on a mission to save Mumbai. A Defence intelligence agent who takes on the gang of sleeper cells without telling about his mission to his family friends as well his love ( who is Sonakshi Sinha).Akshay plays role of soldier who has courage to do anything to save his country. flawless acting with tremendous acting as usual A movie to watch with family. A complete blockbuster and in nutshell PAISAA WASOOL MOVIE" 
" Another hit from Akshay Kumar And Sonakshi Sinha","With his usual dose of action comedy, Akshay Kumar strikes the right chord with 'Holiday: A Soldier is never off duty.' A story of a military DIA agent who makes it his mission to save the city from a cancerous threat of sleeper cells, Captain Virat Bakshi (Akshay Kumar) is a fearless, tactical and has a plan behind every step he takes. Smitten by the bold and beautiful Saiba (Sonakshi Sinha), Capt. Virat knows how to woe his lady love while saving the city.AR Murugadoss created another gem of a movie after GhajiniWatch Holiday for some sleek action sequences, awesome dialogues and groovy tunes!" 
" Akshay Kumar Gonna Rock the Box Office","Holiday is a complete Bollywood movie package. Dedicated to all the soldiers at the border, the movie packs in action, comedy, romance and thrills right to the end. Although there have been many movies that have focused on terrorism but Murugadoss showcases how one soldier can make a pivotal difference. Movie also give a positive message that "where there is will, there is a way" With some awesome comedy timings, Akshay Kumar gives the movie the essential turn it requires at every mode. Holiday is definitely a captivating, and exciting watch to look out for!" 
" Holiday Makes BOOM BOOM in B.O.","A smashing all time Blockbuster Movie! Another movie that brought Akshay Kumar's acting to be praised even by the Critics. Taran Adarsh Rated the Movie 4/5!! Though IMDb Rating is varying since the last day it was 8.4/10. Still the movie is doing well in box office! 1st day collection was little low from the expectation of 20Cr. It was only 12.78 Cr. But the movie picked up very well in Saturday and early estimate says it has collected more than last day in between a range of 12-15 Cr. Sunday expectations are very high & the movie would collect its Best Earning today only! Occupancy Rate in North West is Houseful & Almost full. In the East Zone its average. Some where houseful by pre-booking and somewhere 70% full. Night Shows will decide how much the movie will gross in its weekend! Hopefully results comes out in good numbers! Akshay Kumar's Acting is Outstanding in this film. The tracks are very nice. Komal Mehta thinks Holiday will be a huge success because of the +ve word of mouth! In total its Super Duper BlockBuster MOVIE #Holiday #TeamAkshay" 
" Excellent Movie","Holiday 2014 - Akshay Kumar movie was really better version comparing with Tamil. All the scenes were excellent and superb in Hindi version. I am really hoping to see a second part of this movie. Actress Sonakshi also appeared in a better performance and appearance. Holiday 2 must be with a marriage of Akshay and Sonakshi. It should be a story of villain existence because he was shot only on chest and not on head. Villain should survive the shot and should implement revenge or so called sleeper cells in army or behind Akshay Kumar which makes Akshay remind of villain in his next part. Even the Villain role suits better for Vidyut Jammwal opposite Akshay Kumar. As now a days series of films are part of movie industry, so Holiday 2 should be come." 
" Powerpack performance by Khiladi Kumar","Well I am a huge fan of Akshay. My review may seem to be biased towards him but no one can deny that this was a complete Khiladi show.I won't say it is his best performance but it is as per expectations.Movie has a nice plot with all the ingredients like comedy, thrill and awesome stunts and action (not South Indian action). Akshay is veteran player when it comes to action and did a brilliant job as an army officer. Good to see Govinda after a long time although he just made a special appearance but made an impact.Sonakshi was good too. Freddie did a great job but couldn't match Akki's persona.Even though movie's runtime is 170min but you won't get bored at all. Story hooks you all the time. Overall its a complete entertainer not too be missed." 
" A Super Entertainer!","A remake of the 2012 Tamil film Thuppakki, 'Holiday' is A Super Entertainer, that ranks amongst the better films of 2014, yet. Its well-written & sharply executed! 'Holiday' Synopsis: A military officer attempts to hunt down a terrorist gang & deactivate the sleeper cells under its command.'Holiday', despite a running-time of over a 169-minutes, never really loses pace or momentum. Sure, the romantic-track could've been shortened & even the songs could've been avoided, but other-wise, the action-sequences as well as the thrilling moments are hugely arresting. 'Holiday' is sharply executed by A.R. Murugadoss, who directed the engrossing 'Ghajini, a few years back. Murugadoss's Screenplay, after a slow-start, gathers tremendous momentum & manages to hold your attention till the very end. The second-hour, especially, is top-notch! Cinematography is good. Editing is fairly done. Action-Sequences are outstanding. Music by Pritam is lovely, however, the songs act as a deterrent in the narrative. Performance-Wise: Akshay Kumar is in top-form. He enacts the heroic solider with amazing energy. He owns the film! Sonakshi Sinha does an okay job. Freddy Daruwala is impressive as the menace. Sumeet Raghavan is first-rate. Zakir Hussain is adequate. Govinda, in a cameo, is terrific, as always.On the whole, 'Holiday' works big time as an entertainer. Recommended!" 
" deserve to be watched at least one time in theaters","This one is one of the best of AKSHAY's movies. This is not a typical Akshay Kumar movie. This has no overacting no out of mind action sequences. Story will keep you stick to your seat till the end. Brilliant acting by AK. And also it is motivational one. Songs could have reduced in numbers. But Still pace of story is fast. One would not regret watching it. It is nice one to watch it with family too. Don not miss it. Go and enjoy it. Sonakshi had little to do again. Difference between the Thinking of Police and army has been tried to be conveyed. Direction is very good and is another good one from Murgadoss. Cinematography is also very fine." 
" Holiday is an excellent movie in every possible way. Must watch for those who love and appreciate sensible Cinema.","Holiday is one of the best movies I have watched in recent times. Movie is perfect in every department, story , direction, acting, action and emotion.Akshay Kumar is in excellent form and his portrayal of Captain Virat Bakshi is flawless. This is by far Akshay Kumar's best movie since Special 26.Sonakshi is also a delight to watch. She brings in some light moments in the movie.The new antagonist Freddy Daruwala acts like a pro; it doesn't seem like this was his first movie. Also Sumit Raghwan is wonderful as Akshay Kumar's friend. Surprising, he has more screen time than Sonakshi and Freddy and he does full justice to his screen presence.Must watch for everyone who appreciates sensible cinema and loves his country!!"
