" Amazing","Blue Oranges is a refreshing change. The characters are fresh, the story and screenplay original and the performances stupendous. It keeps one glued till the very end. Rajit Kapoor once again underlines his prowess as an actor.In fact all the characters played their parts to the hilt for which credit goes to the director.The director held the ropes tight not once letting the film take a wrong turn.Blue Oranges simply states that one doesn't need the age old formula of song and dance and fancy locations to make a film interesting. Its a pity the film didn't work at the box office but i surely hope the DVD format keeps the film alive" 
" Keeps you guessing!!","Whodunit?you keep asking till the very very end..This film is a little gem that Bollywood produces only once in a while.Excellent cast, superb performances, good story and above all measured direction make this film worth watching on big screen.The film demonstrates that you do not need any of the typical bollywood elements to make a film worth watching.Its a pity that even though its a "mutiplex film" its release is limited to very few shows.A labor of love that will be under watched but hopefully word of mouth will make it worthwhile for the team behind this venture.A small film that delivers big!!go watch it while you still can on the big screen." 
" The obvious is the enemy of the truth","Blue Oranges:: Warrants real hard concentration. Yup - if you are watching this movie it is demanded that your attention levels should be at its pinnacle. For you miss a single clue, the jig- saw in your head is risked being incomplete. The film kicks off very much akin to tangled up threads - snare and delusion. With each passing reel, the director unweaves the complex plot. The director should be applauded for managing to hold the ropes tight. If he had gone slight astray, the results would have disastrous. Next to the plot, due credit is deserved by all the actors who got associated in this project. They were all near perfect. Rajit Kapoor I perceived reprises his Byomkesh Bakshi character. The downside is the lack of time to build up momentum. A few important aspects integral to the storyline simply kick-start zip, zap, zoom. Little bit of space and room would have been good. And the twist? I would prefer stating "Creative justice" more apt." 
" Slow and dissappointing","Didnt like the end. It was a drag. Wasted my time. I saw it because of the reviews mentioned here but seriously its not worth it." 
" Out of the blue!","Engrossing crime thriller that keep you wondering every scene.
Went to watch it without any expectations, but was pleasantly surprised.
Great plot, good movie.
The acting of female actors could have been better, but overall entertaining." 
" glued on","First the bads....the look of the film was disappointing for me..the look was not in sync wih the story, direction and characters of the film .The Back ground score of Blue Oranges was appalling.I still rate and recommend this movie highly . The way it holds one's attention is quite amazing...no songs, no stars, no look, with a score that actually pulls the film down and still one cant let go...hats off to the debutant director and his team of competent actors Rajit was excellent. Debutant Aham Sharma has promise. Akhil Misra was fantastic.The screenplay holds the film together.Its fresh.it keeps the audience guessing....the spread of red herrings just great.Finally the director....Rajesh Ganguly ...great show sir. Its quite a brilliant film"
