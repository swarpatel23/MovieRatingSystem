" Brilliant movie but only for Guys","Such a movie has never been made in bollywood which is so accurate with todays life of youngsters in big cities, it deals with women, boys the weakness of men towards women, friendship. It accurately depicts how much guys are desperate nowadays and sadly its true, the three friends portrayed in the movie reminds every guy of himself and his college friends, every one can so easily relate to the way they live, the way they talk etc its just so accurate and the way they fall in love and have to go through the relationship just brilliant, although all 3 are excellent but "Liquid" steals the show with his excellent spontaneous dialogues, family audience will not like the movie due to adult language but guys will enjoy the movie, its 10/10 from me, must see movie for all guys." 
" Awesome Movie - Explains Real Life Girl Friends","I have seen this movie 5 times in 3 days....every time I got carried away by the solid punches, superb acting (especially by Liquid) and emotional turning points ..This movie depicts the situations same as in real life..The movie very well do the justice with its name "Pyaar ka punchnama"..explains each thread of so called love.Songs are very well written(great lyrics) and put in the movie as according to the ongoing situations.Simply put, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I don't exaggerate when it comes to talking about movies - - but everything about this one, from the acting to the writing, to the camera work and background music is grade A.Direction of the movie is flawless,this movie is almost perfect in all the departments.I hardly found any mistake in the movie.The story deals with deep matters hidden inside every heart, and it does so one step at a time, with a plot that moves steadily forward, gathering force, substance and intensity.Overall it is a great entertaining movie...I give it 10 out of 10." 
" Just Awesome","To me the movie was just awesome. I did not know anything about the plot of the movie before watching it. At the start just felt like the cliché friendship story with youngsters and stuff, but, to my surprise it was not. The movie had a totally different message, it was truly a masterpiece, had a totally different concept and the acting was superb too. At first i was reluctant to watch the movie because all the faces were new but boy o boy they did a great job better than many known faces would have done it. The only thing I would have liked to see more was the after effects after the end of the current movie, what i mean to say is they should have discarded the songs in between (the first one was good) and then add something to the end. Overall the guys did a great job and a great movie to watch" 
" Awesome !!","The movie made me laugh right from the first scene hilarious dialogues and superb words by the writerThe beauty with which these new comers have played their characters is simply marvelous I loved the way and passion with which the male leads throw their dialogues at a stretch for minutes togetherenjoyed every scene in the movie specially the way the life of these three friends are knitted together ... A real depiction of what LOVE is in this modern eraa sure watch this summer guys please please please don't miss this one ...total entertainer ..... completely worth your time and penny" 
" Excellent Watch for all boys!","I am not a fan of Bollywood movies, but Pyaar Ka Panchnama is definitely a must watch. The movie depicts the real condition of boys who are on the hook. The first half is amusing but the second part is boring and I felt a little frustrated at times looking at the condition of the boys. Just like other Bollywood movies i thought sooner or later these boys are going to teach the girls a bitter lesson, but the end was not dramatic as i expected. The dialogues are well written and the timing is perfect. The new actors have done well. "Ishq na kariyo kake" and "Bann gya Kutta..." are enjoyable songs. A copy of this movie i Will always keep with me. Definitely an out performer for Bollywood." 
" Awesome!","This movie is terrific! The comedy (about 3/4 of the film) is an absolute laugh riot. Direction and performances of the entire cast is top-notch. Screenplay is superb. Dialogues are to die for!! I have never heard so many clever, witty lines combined into one film. Liquid's monologues are always power-packed. The innocent character of the three gives a monologue filled with frustration building up over time--by far, the best performance and scene of the film! The annoying girlfriends also did a fantastic job. The incidents and events in the film are real slices of life. You must have heard it happening somewhere, if you haven't been through it yourself!"

" Recommended to all guys out there","A story of three bachelors or May I say, three carefree wolves. Guys, this one is strictly for men and for those women who can agree with the movie. Rajat a.k.a Rajjo (Kartikeya Tiwari), Vikrant (Raayo Bakhirta)& Nishant (Divyendu Sharma)are three bachelors who live together as flat mates and face a lot of funny and emotional challenges in the coming months as they get into relationships with Neha (Nushrat Bharucha) , Rhea(Sonalli Sehgal) & Charu (Ishita Sharma) respectively.The chemistry between the guys is amazing. The way they converse with each other is hilarious and easy to connect to as most bachelors live the way they do. The character of a frustrated IT professional played by Divyendu is the funniest of all. His portrayal of the character is side- splitting as you can actually relate to the level of aggravation. Apart from him, Nushrat Bharucha plays the role of a nagging and obsessive girlfriend with quite a lot of perfection. Her role in LSD was totally contradictory to what she played in PKP and she did manage to inspire hatred for the character with her acting skills.The background score in the movie is nice and the songs fit well in situations. However, the second half of the movie is way too lengthy and the level of emotional drama depicted is way too much to be quoted as 'Bearable'. The movie shouldn't have been this long and a duration of 120 mins would have been more than sufficient to tell a story which is as simple as this. But, yeah the director and the actors have done a pretty smooth job during the first half. Recommended to all guys out there!!!!" 
" this is the best there is","this by far and i mean by far the greatest comedy of the past decade.if you have bin in a relationship ever in Ur life . this movie is one you could easily relate to.it has a very strong script to compliment some great direction . the background score also does it for me and also the theme song i.e "ban gaya kutta" is quite brilliantly used. i would recommend this movie for all of you out there. 210 minutes of real ENTERTAINMENT.each of the characters is easy to relate to. when my cousin suggested this movie to me i was reluctant.the fact that the starcast was new. i had not evenheard of the movie before.and i had no idea what the movie was about.but believe me i thank him for making me watch this exceptional movie. this movie is a tribute to all guys around the world." 
" Awesome","Well i describe in short The whole direction, editing & acting in this movie is great.I congratulate the whole cast & crew member whomsoever involved in the making of the movie.The Story of the movie is Outspoken and overly critical Nishant Agarwal meets gorgeous new co-worker, Charu, offers his help, assists her financially, and they become close friends. His room-mates, Rajat and Vikrant, are pleased with this outcome as they already have girlfriends in Neha and Rhea respectively. But both the relationships are not as harmonious, as Rajat feels Neha is self-centered and demanding, while Rhea appears to be withdrawn and aloof. Missing their meetings and bar-hopping, the trio decide to take a time-out and be by themselves. All three women, however, find out and decide to accompany them to the beach where they eventually mingle. The trio do not know that soon misunderstandings will crop up - and it will take a lot of effort and understanding to resolve them.Kartikeya Tiwari, Nushrat Bharucha, Divyendu Sharma, Ishita Sharma, Raayo Bakhirta & Sonalli Sehgal I will congratulate all of you guys for your hard work.looking forward to see u all in future best of luck everybody." 
" pyar ka punchnama, bible of every youth","oh god what a movie!! i think it should be made Bible for every new generation youth. when i was watching the movie it was like i was watching some characters of my college. Dhaba, babbar sher, do not move to open door, i thought these things were known to we only but secrets are wide open now. thnxs Luv Ranjan for such a fantastic movie. keep it up dude. Liquid was superb in his role. saali rajjo was little weak and choudhary was really a guy you do not want mess with. overall you must watch this movie. i am sure you will watch it again and again. its the story of 3 working guys. they were living happily with each other. life was simple until some girls entered in their life. from then they start bumpy ride of their life." 
" *****thumbs up....but!!","its was no doubt worth watching flick...not a single minute was waste!! but the ending i think cud have been much better....turning guys against girls for real payback!! like i wud add... after vikrant leaves rhea he goes to a bar where he meets an old friend who ..(old friend shoud've been a known face like Ranbeer or Salman)...vikrant tells him about the things going on with them friends...he takes him home n they awl discuss what happened with them...!! the guy tells them what to do... Rajat's tells that her girl that he has to pay a visit to his parents...and as he comes back he plays the same game with her...to make her realize what he felt and leaves her the same way as in the movie.... Nishant goes to charu the next day at office n says he was calling...as charu started shouting on him he pulls the trigger n says he was calling bcuz she owes him some money which he wants back...the money she took for the flat and other shopping...he gives her a list of the shopping she did on his credit card and etc...and says the kiss wasn't worth this amount so she should return soon...!! Vikrant gets back with the girl...a few days later they go to a party where his friend sends a girl before them introducing herself as vikrant's exgf..they started romancing n Rhea leaves the place in jealousy...she calls vikrant that night but he doesn't receive...next day he gives her back the same excuse for not receiving her call like she did...they have a fight n vikrant give treats her the same way "space,my life etc"...vikrant leaves Rhea.. the dhaba scene must've been altered to "they have no regret for what happened but a little pleasure for paying them back..."" 
" melancholy of every committed guy!!","yes movie is a complete resemblance of guys in a relationship. i know personally i have been in shoes of all three guys and know we can't do much about it. relationship is a chewing gum u can't throw neither u can sallow it. though i don't want to conclude that every relationship suffers same trauma. but in some way or other i feel guys have to go through all this! On serious note heart and soul of the movie is script and dialogues are. the punches are so comic that i burst into a laughter riot. A well done research on relationships and life styles of software engineers. A matured description of their professional life on screen. starting had gr8 impact depicting frustration of every SE. the pace of story is too nice never felt bore though it was 2 and half hour stretched. only thing which lost 3 points was too dramatic in last half n hour. the one more thing was the movie is not a cliché its an original with the feeling of next door story intertwined with lot of humor. some of the scenes where so natural that i felt yes hey!! this what actually happens and the guy is speaking on behalf of me. and the 5 minutes of frustration of rajat(Kartikeya Tiwari) after her girl friend comes to vikram(Raayo Bakhirta) was the best thing in the movie. i know girls will protest that its bit harsh on them because the 3 actresses were shown was a bit over done.direction was good. all leads were fresh and totally depicting the generation(gosh!cant imagine amir khan in 3 idiots) the acting was nice from all debutant but Divyendu Sharma(Nishant Agarwal) stood out among them playing a typical agitated SE who never had a girl but saws coll with his pals but when he got he fell badly.. reminds me some of my classmates.. music was good and fits completely wherever it was needed. life sahi hai has great lyrics which made me listen it twice.all n all please guys go n watch too sympathize injustice inflicted on us.. and girls please don't take it personally try to realize how u people treat as like dogs(ban gay kutta). p.s. for my girlfriend- please sweetheart don't take this review and movie seriously you know how much i love u!!!!" 
" Contemporary Story for the right time","Most of the stories, be it the great Hollywood, the bright Bollywood or good old novels, usually start and stay focused on the the issues of how a woman is usually the victim. It is about emotional exploitation or tragedy associated with a woman. How she is tormented and how she suffers and all that. At the most the pendulum swings half way and delivering a happy ending. For the first time, so honestly a story been told of how men too are a total emotional wreck. Let's face it boys. We are definitely susceptible and there is absolutely no harm in accepting it. I enjoyed the movie for it's so realistic believable story, characters and even the details like the behaviour of each individuals in given situation. Contrary to what the film critics may say, I give this film 9/10. There is no over dose of over acting and false emotions. There is no useless car chase or gun fights or 'action' per say. My key word for this movie is, 'believable'. The story definitely reflects a lot of the modern day men (or boys). Those who are objecting and finding it offensive and playing the feminist harp hear, please don't waste your time ladies. You have had more then your fair share of the sympathy. Now let the boys tell their side of the story. Boys, go watch it. Enjoy it and definitely learn from it. I strongly recommend this movie, not with your girl friend, but with other boys. Have fun." 
" Brilliant movie","I loved watching this movie. I read some negative reviews/comments, they are just lame, don't worry about them. Watch this movie if you get the opportunity. Dialogues and monologues are just superb. The character of Nishant Agrawal was very well played. Charu bashing up Nishant was a very intense scene (real fireworks). Nishat took the punches very well. These days' real life love stories are lust and power driven (materialistic), this is very well depicted in this movie. Most of the time guys while dealing with attractive female put their brain between their legs, with lots of blood following in the wrong direction the heart becomes soft and then falling in trouble is easy. You can't expect guys to be smart (emotionally balanced) at everything when their primary focus is on career. The Director got the best out the actors/actresses. Very well written and directed. Songs were just fine. I don't think it can be done better. Well done Luv Ranjan and Team." 
" Luv Ranjan deserves an award","excellent movie, and its the truth , that's how girls are after a relationship...Luv Ranjan has shown the truth and reality of how females are not just in Indian culture but all the cultures around the world. Every guy should take his girlfriend to watch this movie or show this movie before they tie a node of relationship like a marriage...So if girls quarrels proving herself that she is not like those one in the movie shoe might be of some other kinda then spend most of your time in a relationship know her better than later regretting and feeling screwed .."
