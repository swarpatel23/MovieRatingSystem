" Had potential, but...","I saw this movie at it's Toronto International Film Festival premier. Having watched the hilarious promos, I was very excited.For the few who don't know the plot, I'll give a brief outline. Yogesh Patel (Harman) is a MBA student at the University of Chicago. He is supposed to inherit his maternal grandfather's wealth once he gets married. In order to pay back his brother's huge debt he is forced by his family to get married and being the emotionally sensitive that he is, he gives in to his family's plead. He then decides to see 12 girls (all played by Priyanka Chopra), one from each Rashee (sun sign) in 10 days and decide the one he likes the most.Okay, now to the actors. Each of the 12 characters's stories are unique and well detailed. Priyanka does a fantastic job at playing each role to perfection, well almost, there are some hiccups here and there. But, one has to really commend her growth as an actress. Harman was okay and still showed signs of immaturity as an actor. Though it was big improvement from the horrendous Love Story 2050. The movie is 192 minutes long and you can feel it. Ashutosh really needs to make his movies shorter. The direction otherwise is top-class. The THIRTEEN songs are not that bad, but nowhere close to the expectations one would set for an A-list movie. I personally only liked the title track.What let's it down is the storyline. The story gets slightly boring at times but it picks up and manages to keep you hooked and laughing for 180 minutes. It's what happens in the last 10 minutes is what ruined it, the ending is one of the worst I have ever seen. They build up such a suspense through out the move and it is perfectly poised for a big climax... and nothing. It ends in a lull.I definitely recommend the movie for Priyanka's hilarious and outstanding performance and romantic comedy fans will surely love it. But, it was definitely not worth the $45 I spent on the premier, I would have preferred waiting for a week and watched it for 1/4th the price." 
" Excellent movie","I like all Ashutosh Gowarikar's earlier creations, but when I read the reviews of "Whats your rashee?" I decided against watching the movie. It was forcing of my 3 1/2 year old son which made us go to theatre to watch the movie, believe me its an amazing movie. I don't know why critics love to hate good movies, people like Rajeev Masand think themselves to be god and write whatever they want. But once you watch the movie you will see the brilliance.People are hating 12 songs but those songs take movie forward, length of the movie might be long but I didn't get bored for a single second. No character looks out of place. of course critics like to watch some steamy scenes but this movie does not have one hence critics don't like that. Movie progresses so nicely. Priyanka Chopra steals the whole show but without the support of Harman Baweja it wouldn't have been possible.The whole plot seems so convincing. This is a must watch movie. Please don't go on length of the movie and the thought of 12 songs may be stopping you from going to theatre but those 12 songs are short and sweet. I am not a very big fan of Ashutosh Gowarikar, but this movie just blew my mind off. Go watch it now." 
" A major letdown...","Ashutosh Gowariker has become a brand over the years, he has made milestones like 'Lagaan', 'Swades' & 'Jodhaa Akbar'. Expectations are bound to be there, reading his name creates a excitement in a cine-lover, and I being his die-hard went & watched his latest outing 'What's Your Raashee?'. Sadly, The Ace Filmmaker misses the bus this time! On the whole 'What's Your Raashee?' is long, boring and complicated. Accomplished filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker disappoints big time with his latest outing. Plus, the excessive running time will prove to be a major disadvantage. 13 good songs {though they appear very boring in the film}, good performances & decent camera-work can't save, when a tacky screenplay is aside. As a fan of Gowariker, I am hugely disappointed. The Academy-Award-Nominated Filmmaker makes his weakest fare in 'What's Your Raashee?'.Pluses: The first hr, to an extend is entertaining. Music by Sohail Sen is fantastic; but looks forced in the film completely. Camera-work is decent. Performances are good: Priyanka is remarkable. She plays the very first character & the part of the doctor exceedingly well. Harman is likable. Darshan Jariwala is superb, so are Anjan Shrivastav, Dilip Joshi & Rajesh Vivek.Minuses: The screenplay. The film is very very lengthy, and the songs are a major bore. In fact if some songs were deleted, the movie could've been a bit better. Plus, the Darshan Jariwala-Anjan Shrivastav-Rajesh Vivek track seems forced.Let's hope that the next time Ashu returns as the captain of the ship, he makes a hell of a good film." 
" A Nutshell Review: What's Your Raashee?","I've been following the films made by Ashutosh Gowariker, who has helmed huge epics and worked with the biggest names in Bollywood today, such as Lagaan with Amir Khan, Swades with Shah Rukh Khan, and his previous film Jodhaa Akbar starring Hrithik Roshan and Ashwarya Rai Bachchan. And it's a fact that his films have runtimes of about 3.5 hours, which goes by real quickly as he keeps the story engaging, and the production values for this films are nothing less than magnificent. So naturally my interest was piqued as the auteur has now turned his sights on a romantic comedy, and I wonder exactly how a filmmaker such as he would be able to tackle this mass-appeal genre.Based on the novel "Kimbali Ravenswood" by Madhu Rye, What's Your Rashee? (or translated as star sign for the English speaking audience) has all the ingredients that would allow for the runtime to stretch to a typical Gowariker length, but that's only because the challenge is to present all 12 female characters representing their respective star signs with attempts at equal runtime for each, with a song being inserted during the whirlwind courtship, clocking 13 tunes when the typical production averages 5. Think of it as an extreme speed dating where we get to know the opposite sex in some detail, with some travelling involved as the production showcased different districts in Mumbai, which of course is an eye-opener for one who has never visited India, yet.The story's actually nothing sophisticated, and by romantic comedy standards quite predictable at times. Basically Yogesh Patel (Harman Buweja), an Non-Resident Indian living in Chicago has been summoned back to India because his parents learnt of his multi-million dollar inheritance from his grandfather should he get married, and the family now needs that kind of money to pay off his brother's debts. He reluctantly agrees of course, and sets himself up to meet initially hundreds of girls, but inspiration struck and he decided that he should be 12, one maiden under each star sign.The main draw of the film is of course actress Priyanka Chopra, who has taken on possibly her most challenging film to date, playing 12 characters with more than 12 personalities. Why I say this is because some of her characters are putting on a facade, thus allowing more room for Priyanka to showcase her acting chops, which she did, with the help of stylists decking her out in beautiful dresses, varying make up, wigs, contact lenses and prosthetics even. That's only the physical outlook – you would be amazed at the physical presentation at how chameleon-like this ex-Miss World can be – and she takes her roles on with gusto to make you feel with some, laugh at some, and endear towards some through some wonderful pieces of acting. Not to mention that she broke the record set by Kamal Hassan, who tackled 10 characters in his movie Dasavatharam.Unfortunately for Harman Baweja, who's in need for a booster to his fledging career after the flop Love Story 2050 (which incidentally also co-starred Priyanka), and the lacklustre Victory, his role as Yogesh, quite obsessed with doing the right thing each time, finds himself constantly upstaged and overshadowed by Priyanka's performance. It's a little pity of course, given that if it's anyone who can help him it'll likely be Gowariker given the director's strengths, but this was not to be as it's pretty much the leading lady's vehicle. But that's not to mean that Gowariker's film here is without flaws. Amongst his works to date, I feel that this was perhaps the weakest of the lot, suffering from a number of subplots which provided nothing more than a distraction to the meat of the story, such as that involving the infidelity of his uncle and marriage-consultant (Darshan Zariwala), and that of the loansharks who pop up now and then for unnecessary comic relief.However, its strengths more than compensated for its drawbacks, such as how Priyanka just ran with her opportunities to shine, 12 times. The story also provided some insights into how arranged marriages, with dowries and all, are still conducted and quite a cultural thing, and the plights that some family face with having too many daughters, and wondering how best to have them married off. As the encounters with the different women were rather stand- alone, each allowed for the examination of traits and characteristics that will make you love, or loathe, and generally applies across the board, which allows you to identify with such instances.But for all its narrative twists in secrets that cannot be kept, for its fleeting discussions on honesty or lack thereof, what I enjoyed most was the quasi-explanation of why the females that Yogesh meets, all share a striking resemblance with one another, which other characters don't seem to agree with, but only to the male protagonist. I liked how it was mentioned that we all have this preconceived idea of how our soul mate would preferably look like, and from then we tend to project this thought onto whomever we think would have a chance with, or at least tend to take those physical bits into consideration, only for their inner character, when revealed, to be anything but adhering to our dreams.What's Your Raashee? for the romantic in me, worked wonders, and will leave you guessing at the end just who Yogesh would end up with, since Gowariker deliberately kept you hanging in suspense for as long as he possibly could. I'd recommend it as a date movie anytime if you're looking for something different from the usual Hollywood fare. Just remember to empty your bladders before the show starts, or you'll have to plan to hit the loo just about the time Leo gets introduced, for that inbuilt intermission." 
" Stop the unfair criticism of WYR!","It is time someone put a stop to this trashing of a perfectly fine film that has been crafted with much thought and creativity. Is the movie very long? Yes, it is and SO WHAT? This may not be Oscar material, but Priyanka shines in every single role she dons, and Harman is a neat foil to her with his gentlemanly persona and apt acting (he too has come under very unfair criticism, our "superstars" would have looked out of place as Yogesh Patel).The music is superlative, since the movie was to take 13 songs, Sohail Sen has made a real effort to make each not just melodious but also very contextual. "Bikhri Bikhri" is superbly composed, its inspiring lyrics (Javed Akhtar) have been ably handled. The title song, a Jazz number, with which the movie opens is mesmerizing. "Aaja Lehraate" has been on the music channels and gives Harman enough scope to showcase his dancing skills.Now the story, it is not meant to be taken too literally and too seriously, although almost every character that Priyanka plays has something to say about the society we live in; nothing too preachy but yes it does make you think a bit. The most touching are the Priyanka who admits to having had an affair and the Priyanka who is tutored to act Western but is too clumsy to pass as such. The comedy does not have the people falling off their chairs in desperate throes of howling laughter, but it certainly puts a smile on most faces.Gowarikar has done a good job, instead of asking for edits I would say he should have made WYR I and WYR II, each two-hour long, both released within a space of 3 months. At least people would have stopped complaining about its length! Let us for once appreciate something that dares to be different and is yet entertaining." 
" Sweet and hilarious","This is Ashutosh Gowarikars first venture into a romantic comedy and one must say he comes out as a winner.The Film starts with Yogesh Patel (Harman Baweja) who is forced to get married in ten days to save his family from an unforeseen ordeal. Thus, to begin his search to find love he agrees to meet one girl from each Rashee. All these 12 girls are played by Priyanka Chopra.Each of the 12 girls have a strongly etched out character, some make you laugh and some touch your heart. Priyanka has done a outstanding job in playing out each character with a difference, she shows her versatility as an actor.Harman Baweja has excellent comic timing, and looks very good. You see the Films through his eyes and he keeps his performance just about right, does not overdo the comic portions of he Film. He keeps it real and has an endearing quality to him.Ashutosh Gowariker has again proved that he is an A list director and despite the length which does make you impatient, he still keeps you hooked till the climax of the FIlm.This Film sets itself apart from the formulaic romantic comedy and keeps you engaged. Also, Harman and Priyanka make a fabulous pair !" 
" Excessive length mires an otherwise great flick","The Bad: -Length. Film is nearly 3 1/2 hours long. They could easily have done away with 4 of the songs (e.g. Maanunga Maanunga, Saloni, Su Che and Dhadkan Dhadkan), the whole Devukaka cheating and Bhai subplots, and the film would have lost nothing. In fact, it would have been much more enjoyable. -Editing. Renu Saluja should have challenged her director about the worthiness of some of the frivolous scenes. -The lengthy Bond style interpretive dance intros for each female character got annoying real quick. Yeah, Priyanka looks smoking, but the device wears its welcome quick.The Good: -Priyanka Chopra -Priyanka Chopra Oh and did I forget to mention, Priyanka Chopra? A few years ago, I would have never believed the awkward side heroine from Sunny Deol's miserable Hero would grow in to such a Fine (in more ways that one) actress. She grabs you the second she walks in with her first role as Anjali, and you'll be hooked all the way to the end of the Jhankhana act. Songs are almost all great (and only downside is some are unnecessary in the movie).Have a feeling some audience members who are obsessive about their belief in astrology may be offended by Ashutosh playing on the characters. But my wife and I thought it was cute. If only the film had repeat value in the cinemas." 
" A Remarkable Film","A remarkable film that looks at the age old tradition of arranged marriages that rely upon the influence of Raashee (zodiac sign) compatibility in selecting the right partner, What's Your Raashee? is a romantic comedy that carries the distinct signature of ace filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker. The film's screenplay is based on the Gujarati novel written by Madhu Rye, titled Kimball Ravenswood, and while Harman Baweja plays the affable Gujarati NRI Yogesh Patel living a perfect life in Chicago, Priyanka Chopra plays a record breaking twelve roles Anjali, Sanjana, Kajal, Hansa, Rajni, Chandrika, Mallika, Nandini, Pooja, Vishakha, Bhavna and Jhankhana all girls whom Yogesh meets in the pursuit of finding his 'suitable bride.'Yogesh is a young man who in his heart has always wanted a love marriage. Till suddenly he is told that he must find his dream girl within ten days to save his family from utter ruin. Finding the dream girl is tough enough. Finding her in a hurry is even tougher. His solution is simple; he will meet one girl from each Raashee , as he feels that is the best way to make sure he finds a suitable wife, while also giving himself twelve chances to fall in love. Two meetings per day gives him six days to meet them, three days to make a final decision and he can get married on the tenth day, or so he thinks.Without getting into further details of the plot and the trouble that the family is facing as it will spoil the viewers' fun, one must say that unlike the conventional romantic comedies that Indian cinema offers today, this film reminds you of the genuine charm and humorous undertones of a Hrishikesh Mukherjee or a Basu Chatterjee film of yesteryears. Gowariker weaves comedy and drama deftly amidst extremely hummable songs scored by young Sohail Sen, and every Zodiac sign gets its own signature tune, coming together as an amazing amalgamation in the thirteenth song, Chehre Jo Dekhe Hain, when the protagonist has to make the final choice, and recaps all the twelve wonderful women he has encountered over the past few days. Needless to say, What's Your Raashee? is a musical, and one that takes its leisurely time to unfold, but it is a film that keeps you smiling with your feet tapping through its three hour plus length. A refreshing song laden comedy that reminds you of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun? but with far more humour and variety, it is also a fine showcase of superlative performances from Priyanka Chopra and Harman Baweja.While Priyanka brings forth a versatility that has to be seen to be believed, Harman gets the Gujarati boy just right, winning your heart with his sincerity he transforms into the perfect Yogesh and carries the film splendidly considering the entire film is his journey and hence the audience sees every match finding encounter through his eyes. As a high concept idea and beyond, you tend to almost forget that each new girl who is introduced to Yogesh is played by Priyanka Chopra, simply because Priyanka through the smallest nuances and behavioural traits ensures that even in such short screen time, each girl has a well defined overall personality and that each girl is independent of the other; no doubt one of the finest performances by any female actor in Hindi cinema in a long time, under the deft direction of an experienced filmmaker with a wide latitude and unsurpassed emotional maturity.Supporting actors like Dilip Joshi as Yogesh's brother Jitubhai, Aanjjan Shrivastava as his father Bharatbhai and Darshan Jariwala as Devukaka, the rather interesting uncle, help in enlivening the proceedings, adding colour to the central plot. Of course, one cannot forget Rajesh Vivek as the enterprising jasoos on a mission through the film, who makes every Gowariker film all the more interesting.Songs like the romantic ballad Jao Na, or Su Che with its mischievous play of words and choreography, or the powerplay of Maanunga, or Pyaari Pyaari with its sweet moments of simple courtship interactions across a working date, are just some examples of how entertainingly every situation is scored and picturised, and every girl has a song to be remembered by.And yes, the film has a lot to say between the music and comedy, be it through Javedsaab's lyrics, or through the director's perceptive observation of our society and the rules that dictate arranged marriages; the fact that only Gowariker can have subtle messages placed even within a light hearted romantic comedy once again proves that his films may have length, but they also will always have a well placed heart and soul, and will be remembered for years to come as both seminal and entertaining.BOTTOM LINE - A Remarkable Film.... a big Thumbs UP !!!" 
" Priyanka is mindblowing!","Whats Your Rashee, is a very very well made film. The film is about marriage and the zodiac signs. The film has Priyanka Chopra enacting 12 different roles and looks, and what performances man! She is just fantabulous! I was neutral about Priyanka Chopra, but Fashion, Kaminey and Whats Your Rashee made me love her completely! The direction is not up to the mark if compared to previous ventures by Ashutosh Gowariker (Lagaan, Swades, Jodhaa Akhbar), maybe it is because of the genre change, Ashutosh is directing a romantic comedy for the first time.Music is a revelation, Ashutosh was stuck to A.R.Rahman, whos compositions are beautiful. This time Sohail Sen took the music directors seat and did a fantastic job, all songs are extremely melodious and shot nicely. Sohail Sen has a very nice voice himself and therefore crooned a few songs of the film, even Ashutosh Gowariker did a track and that sounds nice too, double thumbs up to the music department.Harman Baweja has acted nice too for the first time after a string of bad performances (Love story 2050, Victory), although he looks kind of stiff sometimes and his body language needs some improvement on screen, Darshan as Devu does a very nice job and is very impactful.The music video Whats Your Rashee, which is the last song of the movie has been shot so beautifully, a really innovative video, and very enjoyable too.I am rating this movie 9 out of 10, would have rated it 7 otherwise, but the Priyanka Chopra and her performances, and the extremely melodious music make the movie deserve more.All in all, go for it if you are in the mood for a sweet movie, with an incredible Piggy Chopps and great music.P.S. I do miss a sequence in which Yogesh meets all the girls and explains them why he didn't choose that particular girl.Thumbs up for sure :)" 
" A Big Disappointment","I was really looking forward to watching this movie. As they say too many expectations disappoint and that's what happened with me tonight. WYR is a big disappointment.We all know the story still I will summarize it here hopefully without any spoilers. Yogesh Patel is an NRI who is forced to find and marry a girl within 10 days. He does not have much time so he decides to meet 12 girls – 1 from each rashee and each played by Priyanka Chopra and ultimately ends up marrying one of them. The movie has its good moments – and most of them belong to PC.It is PC's best performance so far undoubtedly. This girl surprised everyone with her performance in Fashion and then in Kaminey and once again in WYR. Harman Baweja is huge improvement from Love Story 2050. He seems to have a good handle at comedy and does not disappoint. Darshan Jariwala is excellent as always. Dilip Joshi is funny and plays the role of a Gujarati business class person very effectively.Music is very fresh and soulful. Baring one or two songs all of them are very well composed, written and sung. Jaao Na specially is very soothing. However, while watching the movie you realize they are forced in storyline. Nice camera-work. They have captured various facets of Mumbai including Marine Drive, Haji Ali, Kamla Nehru Park as well some areas of Navi Mumbai effectively.The movie also has some really good social messages against dowry and child marriages. However, I have some very basic questions for AG:1. Was it really required to have one song per almost every character? 2. Was it really required for the movie to be 3 hours and 20 minutes long?The biggest minus of the movie is its screenplay which is really weak. I am OK with long movies; I enjoyed Jodha Akbar even though it was equally long. But when a really long movie starts to bore you and you have to look at your watch several times during the movie - it definitely raises such a question. Seriously, WYR does not have content good enough for so much time. Had it been wrapped up within 2.5 hours it would have been a much more interesting movie.I also found some of the stories (Tula, Dhanu and Sinha) pretty much unrealistic. The plot about whole 4 crore lost in share market is very weak and fact that the entire movie is based on it is bizarre. Stories involving each of PC characters should've been much shorter and preferably without those annoying songs. The movie also gets predictable towards the end. At least an hour before the end I correctly guessed the girl whom Yogesh Patel would marry.Overall, one should watch this movie once and only once for PC. She should win Actress awards for this. However, be prepared to be bored for this marathon rom-com.P.S.: I have not read Kimball Ravenswood by Madhu Rye. It's a very popular novel so I believe the movie adaptation has gone wrong and original story must be really good." 
" A very good movie","This movie was excellent! First of all, it didn't seem like an Ashutosh Gowarikar film at all, until you see the similar casting from his previous movies. The asset of the film is Priyanka Chopra, she enacts all the twelve roles she has brilliantly. The script was nice and was handled by Ashutosh maturely. Harman acted well, but he under played in a few parts. Darshan Jariwala acts really well and shows that he is one of bollywood's finest actors. The music was okay, but it felt as if Sohail Sen was trying to imitate AR Rehman without any success. The song "Koi jaane na" was nice.Ratings.ACTING 9/10.DIALOGUES 10/10.SCREENPLAY 8/10.MUSIC 8/10.PRIYANKA CHOPRA 20/10.HARMAN BAWEJA 9/10.CINEMATOGRAPHY 9/10.DIRECTION 10/10.Overall, the film was a treat to watch, the 3 hours 20 minutes never get boring! You would want it to keep going and going and see PRIYANKA and ASHUTOSH's magic work!!! If you like emotional, funny, and some meaningful cinema, this one is for you!! Its not one of those though provoking ones, but it makes you feel good!" 
" Sunsign of a film","Fate of a person might be determined by his/her stars. But fate of movies are determined not just by stars (the ones on the sky plus the ones on the ground) but by many other factors. This whole idea of making a film version of, Madhu Rye's old classic Gujarati novel 'Kimball Ravenswood", is a smart move. Already there were many versions for theater (a popular one by Naushil Mehta) as well as a hit TV series called Mr. Yogi by film-maker Ketan Mehta, based on the same novel. The idea nonetheless is smart one and contemporary too with the decision of casting same actress for twelve roles playing one girl for each of twelve rashis (sun signs). Now imagine a film which has everything going perfect viz. big banner, top director and a story from a popular best selling novel, is a winner in hand. Right? No, wrong! The positive thing about the film is it is not your run of the mill film but a fresh attempt minus a fresh approach. The screenplay is dull and dragging. The dialogs are uninteresting. It is a half-baked, half hearted attempt. The film not just fails at script level but even the treatment and narrative reminds you of films from 80s. It also has a world record of same actress (Priyanka Chopra), playing twelve different characters but there is not much depth in the twelve distinct characters of the lead actress, in fact many of them look quite similar. It seems the whole effort is gone into giving 12 different get ups to the lead actress rather than infusing some life into the uninspiring characters. . Even if one ignores the astrological features, one would surely be interested in watching twelve different girls who are contrastingly, diverse in characters. It would be interesting if contemporary sex politics would have introduced. To make plot further confusing, a silly subplot of spying on a marriage consultant for extra marital affair, just fails to hold the story together. There are though interesting moments to hold viewer's interest viz. meeting with the jeweler father as well as meeting with prospective bride who asks for pre-nuptial agreement but they are too few and far. A lot more in performances is expected. Other characters too look like boring caricatures i.e. one-dimensional. If that is not enough, the length of 3.30 hrs surely kills you. A lot of trimming is needed. Numerous songs woven in the storyline is an unnecessary measure though songs sound better than the film but in isolation (Music Sohail Sen). If Director Ashutosh Gowariker had attempted a slice of life, subtle, intelligent comedy on the lines of Mr. Yogi, it would have worked better. Worse, the narrative is handled in an old fashioned linear way, whether it is dramatic, romantic or comic, you don't know. It surprises you that this film is coming from the director of brilliant films like Lagaan and Jodha Akbar. It seems makers have more faith in checking the rashi of film rather than checking the pulse of audience." 
" What's Your Rashee : Disappointing","How many of you were waiting for this one from Gowariker? i know many! Sadly for all Gowariker fans, What's Your Rashee is absolutely disappointing. Based on Madhu Rye's novel Kimball Ravenswood, WYR's script is as flat as it can possibly get. What's Your Rashee's story revolves around Yogesh Patel(Harman Bhaweja) an MBA student studying in Chicago, who is forced to return to India after receiving a message about his father's deteriorating health. On reaching India is when the family of Yogesh let out the actual reason. Yogesh is then told about the share scam committed by his brother and the family's huge debt. He's also told about the solution offered by a astrologer according to whom, If Yogesh gets married on the 20th, huge wealth is to follow the family on the very day. He's given a mere 10 days to decide a girl and get married. It does not take long for his family to convince Yogesh and he's then out looking for brides. After a lot of confusion about the brides shortlisted by his uncle, Yogesh comes up with a bizarre idea of meeting one girl from each of the 12 zodiac signs. And the plot leading upto Yogesh deciding his soul mate among the 12 is for you to watch it yourself. Gowariker seems to have failed miserably with WYR provided the quality of movies that hemade previously. The movie fails to take off and the plot of the movie does not really convince you at any level. The one and the only thing that is impressive with WYR is Priyanka Chopra's impeccable performance playing 12 different characters. She's absolutely mind blowing with each of the 12 characters and probably the only thing that makes you sit right through the exhausting 3 hours 15 minutes. Harman Bhaweja is good and tries his best to make an impact with his honest acting supported well by rest of the cast. The funnier parts that were supposed to be funny are not funny and it just frustrates you more. The music by Sohail Sen is ordinary and the 12 songs used for 12 the different characters are not impressive either. Reviewed By- Raghav RamaiahOriginally Posted at talkingpopcorns.com" 
" A New Yorker's Perspective","Okay, I watched this because it was on Netflix's list of films being deleted for instant play. I guess they ran out of server space or something. I'm not that familiar with Bollywood films, but this is not my first one.I'll skip the synopsis. As an American, I found Yogesh's American-ness and Priyanka's (whichever version's) endless chicago references very entertaining. Outside of that, The Pros: 1. Priyanka. If you just want to watch her all day, it's a good movie for that.2. It's actually funny most of the way through, even the awkward bits with the debt and the spying. The parents of Priyankas (Priyanki?) were also very entertaining.3. The music, mostly. There are several good Indian songs, and maybe a couple western style ones that didn't work so well. There's one in there that reminded me of scandanavian metal.4. Dancing. I get that this is the best part of a bollywood film. American movies haven't been up to this since the 1950s.The Cons: 1. Length. At 3+1/2 hours, you have to have a lot of story, and WYR runs out after about 2 hours, like any romantic comedy. Everything about the situation has already been said, and we roll on with less interesting stuff. If it's too long for you, just skip ahead to the Priyanka scenes you're probably watching it for.2. Social Messages. I see a lot of people saying this was a plus, but I felt like the film was hitting me over the head with political correctness. I suspect if I were an Indian I'd be actually offended. It's the movies job to entertain us, not reprogram us.3. Not everything quite works in the story. It misses the opportunity for a play on Priyanka playing all the girls, and plot development threads don't really go anywhere. That in mind, it's okay to skip through them to browse for pure entertainment.Overall it was as substantive as a western romantic comedy, but no more, so light on content, but very entertaining." 
" Awful would be an understatement",""What's Your Rashee" would make you wonder if he is the same director who wielded the megaphone in "Lagaan", "Swades" & "Jodha Akbar". It wouldn't be no rocket-science to state that the starting point namely the book "Kimball Revenswood" by Madhu Rye is the culprit. I would also add another state that translating a book to screen requires a different sensibilities altogether and this was sadly big time missing. And shouldering Priyanka Chopra to breathe life into all the 12- characters was indeed an herculean task. Don't get me wrong but she put an effort into each character more than humanly possible. But it gets inanely boring after a few characters pass by. If twelve different popular actress'es were chosen instead, it would have taken the movie to a different level altogether. Harman Baweja is imprisoned into poor man's Hritik caricature. The length of the movie adds to the woes, especially after 7th Priyanka, the audience wishes to fast-forward to the climax to find who becomes the better-half of Mr. Yogesh Patel.The comedy track was mundane and hardly evokes mirth. Music by Sohail Sen is different but misses the bulls-eye. Good luck next time ASHu. You are a phoenix and will surely rise from ASHes.PS: My mind is still afresh with the spectacular performance of Late Mohan Gokhale who breathed life into Mr. Y I Patel in "Mr. Yogi" on good old Doordarshan which has had similar storyline." 
" A complete one woman show but too long and uninspiring.","Looking at the project as a whole, I had my doubts on whether Ashutosh will be able to create the same magic with Harman Baweja, as he previously did with Hrithik Roshan in the role of an unimaginable Akbar. With a shaky subject in hand and mediocre songs on air, I was not sure of another polished product from the director with a big stature in the Industry. And all my doubts proved right as "What's Your Rashee" came out to be just a below average movie with an unbearable long length, not so impressive content and many unwanted ordinary songs.Said to be based on the novel by Madhu Rye, the story (which is quite predictable) moves around a young NRI boy who is here in India to marry a girl within a week. To make a good choice he decides to meet a girl from each sun sign and then take a decision. Unfortunately, the interesting idea, fails completely in its uninspiring screen adaptation. Other than the twelve different girls brilliantly portrayed by Priyanka Chopra, there is no particular scene in the movie to rave about. In fact if you see the movie, ignoring the truth that it has been directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, then you will just take it as a debut project of any budding director and nothing more.The biggest disappointment in the movie is its extra long length and completely uninspiring music. The length is fine when we are watching a movie like "Lagaan" or "Jodha Akbar", but you cannot make every project close to four hours of duration just for the sake of it. Ashutosh could have easily edited out most of the songs in the movie as they are not anywhere a part of the progressing storyline. The run of the mill soundtrack stands nowhere, if compared to the scores of Gowariker's earlier projects. Yes, he had the great A. R. Rahman on his side in all those musical masterpieces, but there were also good hummable songs in his "Baazi" too, which proves that he indeed has a good choice of melodies. Surprisingly in "What's Your Rashee" out of more than 12 songs, we don't even have one particular track to stay in our mind except the obvious title number.Apart from its length and music, the monotonous act of seeing girls again and again becomes quite boring and annoying after a while. There is a very silly explanation given about the similar faces of all 12 girls in the start which puts you off straight away. The completely avoidable and poorly written detective angle in the script fails to make an impact. It also does not reach any conclusion since Ashutosh simply forgets about this added sub-plot towards the end and moves on. There is no proper justification given about how & why Harman makes his choice in the climax as everything just gets sorted our very easily and quickly.In few words, it's a Priyanka Chopra movie all the way, where she acts, dances and emotes in 12 different ways in a fantastic manner. Unarguably, it's one of the best performances of her career till date. On the other hand, I really feel sad for Harman Baweja, who is a true hard worker, but still hasn't got the lady luck smiling at him. When it came to Harman's turn, even the man with a midas touch, lost his golden stroke and failed. May be it's all destiny that whatever the boy does, he always gets compared to Hrithik Roshan, because of their naturally similar looks.All other character artists in the movie have simply performed their allotted roles as a duty towards the director. Cinematography serves the purpose well and visual graphics are nice to see on the screen. Especially the graphical presentation of all the sun signs at the start reminded me of the famous James Bond opening credits, known for their brilliant graphics and girls.A few decades back we had a T.V. Serial called "Mr.Yogi",where also a young NRI selects few girls to meet before his planned marriage. In each episode he used to meet a new girl from a different family and background. And I still remember, that I enjoyed the T.V. serial many times more than the current "What's Your Rashee". In all, a big disappointment from the director who's all last 3 movies, are there in my "Movies To See Before You Die" list."
