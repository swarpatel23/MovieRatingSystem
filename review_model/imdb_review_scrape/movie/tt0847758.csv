" Good movie","This movie is produced by K C Bokadia and Directed by Vijay Sadanah has Rajesh Khanna the SuperStar playing a character but a leading role. He is playing father of two daughters and is tormented by Mohnish Bahl. He loses one of his daughters but manages to save the other from the evil desires of Mohnish Bahl. Rajesh Khanna has played his part reasonably well but looks old in the movie. The super Star should have taken more footage, but the climax belongs to him. See the movie, it is good- the weakness is the music of the movie- it is uninspiring and not of Rajesh Khanna's class. The production values are just okay. The young girls do their parts well."
