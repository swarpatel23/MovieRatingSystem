" Intensely gripping, fresh and amazing movie","I wonder how can this movie has such a low rating and box office collections. I think bollywood has become a formula industry. You get and mix specific ingredients and huge profit is guaranteed.RGV has come back with a hammer. Plot is very unique and attractive from the tag line. Puneet Singh although new is brilliant in his role. His voice and looks suits the character. Background music was brilliant although I can't comment about the songs because I never like to listen songs while watching a movie. The idea of the movie is the whole life of it and luckily it was met with justice throughout the movie.I am desperately looking for sequel which is promised but I am not sure if there will be any because of the low business of the movie so far." 
" Surprising... A Great Movie!!!","I had been a great fan of RGV in the past. But because his last few collections, I stopped going after his new releases. Same happened for this movie. I was pretty skeptic about watching Satya 2. Reasons included its name (Satya 2), the movie title (which clearly described it would be a heroism movie, in which RGV has always failed), and finally, the bad rating here at IMDb. However, one of my friend convinced me to watch it. And I thanked him later.It is no doubt a heroism movie. However, don't let the movie title and its description stray you. Even its current rating seems to be too low for such a masterpiece. I'm sure that there is team of haters particularly trying to sabotage this movie, as there is no reason for them to rate it 1, even if they don't like the movie. What makes it a good movie? It's all in the execution. I don't want to add the spoiler tag here, so I won't emit out any information not already disclosed in the trailers or movie description. This is the kind of movie that takes the viewer to a journey, rather than keeping him unsure about the twists/climax/ending. It clearly tells everything in advance, and even though we already know what is going to happen, we actually want to see it how it is going to happen. That was a great, and in fact, a very interesting experience. We know that the person named Satya is going to reinvent the underworld in 2013. But is this unknown person is capable of doing that? That's the greatest thing about this movie. I normally hate such movies, and I was pretty much impressed (once again, after so many years) from RGV for forcing me to like something I normally don't. This character surely has such skills. I will highly recommend this movie. 10/10." 
" Ram Gopal Varma's displays mastery in Underworld thriller","Satya 2 a crime thriller brilliantly directed by Ram Gopal Varma in the tradition of "Satya" "Company" "Sarkar Raj" .The Main lead Puneet Singh displays extraordinary talent and controlled passion and will go on to win hearts and laurels !Some of the dialogues will become Satya "speak" as the film will slowly by word of mouth go on to become a RGV cult film.The strength of real power lies in concealing it! Destruction of old is necessary for inventing the new. " Satya's" Company is a idea, a thought and has a "life" of its own among millions of dissatisfied and deprived citizens and can never be eliminated. A modern day Robin Hood style professionally executed concept which has a life form of its own and will continue to fuel the passions of citizens as long as injustice remains in society- perpetually!Background score,cinematography and framing of shots is amazing. A taut thriller." 
" SUPERRRRR SE BHI UPPERRRR wali performance...","Truly speaking when Satya 2 was released, I did not took much interest in watching it. RGV's Aag was still a nightmare. But yesterday night a friend came over with this movie. She said its been highly recommended in her circle, so we decided to watch. The movie didn't seem very interesting at first but as it progressed, we didn't even released when more than 1 hour of the movie was over. The performances are too good. Lead actor Puneet is a awesome actor. The way he has carried the character of Satya is brilliant. I wish I could say the same thing about the actress. Any ways the movie has a very interesting story line and is a real treat for its viewers. I still can't believe that a movie like this has only managed to earn 1.1 cr on box office. RGV to be blamed for bad publicity I guess.As my friend said in his review, this movie in underrated here on IMDb and the description also does not give you an idea of how AWESOME the movie is. I'll again give this movie 10/10 ratings. Eagerly waiting for the sequel with Puneet Singh Ratn as Satya." 
" An under-rated sequel","When the film was released, many critics bashed up this movie. Its release went unnoticed because it was released at a time when so-called superstar movies like Krish 3 and Ram Leela was also released. Normally a movie made by Ram Gopal Varma is bound to be bashed up by the critics. Even though the entire film is predictable the viewers are bound to be surprised with end result. In terms of performance - Puneet Singh was suitable for the role of Satya. Anaika Soti as his girlfriend didn't have much to do. But the surprise package of the film was the actor who enacted the role of the retired police commissioner. The camera work was handled in a typical RGV style, Hence there is nothing much to say about it. Satya 2 may not be a treat for usual film goers. But it is definitely going to surprise the fans of RGV and underworld films." 
" Boredom , Dull, insipid","So satya was a flick... RGV is a spent force
Overacting, loud acting, slow paced, out of control acting.... Haywire script, third rated dialogues and girls are so ugly and skinny that you can't even watch them" 
" RGV film","Only RGV ke Ilanti movies theeyadam sadhyamavtundhi" 
" This movie is not for everyone, but only for the elite minded","It pains me to say that people just associate star cast in the movie to even consider it as a good movie. This movie is one of the most awesome bollywood movies ever made, maybe even btr than the original Satya that came in 1998 and overshows several Hollywood movies. This movie is a 11 for me. My only parameter that defines a movie is the logic that shapes the story. The only thing that I found irritating in this movie are the two songs..nothing else..I don't even know the name of the director..just that this movie represents something that is definitely above stupid drama,romance or comedy movies. It represents the mindless followers of a system and one person who breaks from it..simply brilliant!!" 
" A shockingly immature film, from once a maestro & trendsetter of Hindi Cinema.","The experience of watching SATYA 2 was certainly not a pleasant one for me, who once felt proud to be called a die-hard fan or follower of the cult cinema made by the innovative Ram Gopal Varma. No doubt, the scenario regarding his directorial ventures has gone from disappointing to poor in the recent years but honestly I never felt this bad before, while going for a new RGV movie released on a fresh Friday.To put it straight, RGV was one of those few Indian directors who gave me butterflies in the stomach full of excitement before witnessing his each & every distinctive film made back in the 90s. But I had never really expected that a day would come when I will be the only person to buy a ticket for RGV's new film and then further would have to request the theater manager to run the movie despite of having no audience at all in its first show. So as a review there is nothing to write about SATYA 2 (completely unrelated with the cult SATYA of Bhiku Matre), since it expectedly has the same old repetitive concept and doesn't offer even a single interesting scene right from its first frame. The film talking about the new underworld of 2013 is needlessly stuffed with songs as usual and its performances again range from decent to immature like many of RGV's recent debacles. Anyway SATYA 2 did take me back in time to the late 80s when we repeatedly had several similar experiences sitting in the theater with our heads down, watching the severe mistakes made on the screen by some reputed names of that era. Those were the times, when film freaks like me, actually watched a movie more for its renowned director than the famous actors featuring in it to be precise. So even if the film had a great star-cast it was the director who had more reputation on stake than the actors and that is the reason even the slide with the director's name written on it (in the opening titles), was loudly cheered with a big applause from the enthusiastic audience showing their huge craze & expectations.Now among these iconic directors, there were two names who gave some extremely disappointing films with Amitabh Bachchan in the late eighties and SATYA 2 made me feel just the same, sitting in the theater with a long sad face, exactly in the position as I was while watching films such as Ganga Jamuna Saraswati (Manmohan Desai - 1988), Jaadugar (Prakash Mehra - 1989) & Toofan (Ketan Desai - 1989) more than two decades back. However the only difference was, that in those times the hall used to be fully packed on the first day and we had several friends (groups) looking at each other's faces questioning the messy content coming from our favourite director? And here while watching SATYA 2, I was all alone amongst the empty seats and there were only theater attendants watching the film standing along the walls and no one else to exchange the looks with.Interestingly post the 80s, in the later years (around the new millennium), films like Trimurti (Mukul Anand – 1995), Jhooth Boley Kauwa Kaatey (Hrshikesh Mukherjee – 1998), Kisna (Subhash Ghai - 2005), Yuvraaj (Subhash Ghai - 2008) and few others also made me feel the same way and I really wonder that is it the age, over-exposure, burden, over- confidence or anything else which actually causes this fall in every legendary director's career.in most of the cases!But returning to RGV and comparing his style of film-making with the other directors, there is a unique & noteworthy kind of difference in the career of this visionary, which still leaves a certain amount of doubt in your mind about his 'losing the art' completely. And the difference is that where all the other reputed directors made some extremely poor films in the end of their careers, there RGV has been associated with such films right from the beginning without any doubt. In other words, more than 2 decades long career graph of the trendsetter has never been on the upward swing constantly but has always been an uneven ride (having a lot of valleys in the graph) with a mixture of outstanding and poor films coming at a regular gap simultaneously right from the 90s as mentioned in the following chart.Shiva (1989) & Raat (1992).......followed by a Drohi (1992) Rangeela(1995).......followed by a Daud (1997) Satya (1998).......followed by a Mast (1999) Kaun? (1999).......followed by a Jungle (2000) Company (2002) & Bhoot (2003).......followed by a Naach (2004) Sarkar (2005) & Darna Zaroori Hai (2006).......followed by a Shiva (2006) Nishabd(2007).......followed by a Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag (2007) & Darling (2007) Sarkar Raj (2008).......followed by a Contract (2008 Phoonk (2008).......followed by a Agyaat (2009) Rann (2010) & Rakhta Charitra-I (2010).......followed by a Rakhta Charitra-2 (2010) Not a Love Story (2011).......followed by a Bhoot Returns (2012) & Department (2012) The Attacks of 26/11 (2013).......followed by a Satya 2 (2013)Hence though his films might not have been appreciated by the critics or proved as runaway success at the box office since Sarkar (2005), yet one cannot say that he has completely lost the skill, vision or art, considering the projects such as Nishabd, Sarkar Raj, Rann, Phoonk, Not A Love Story and The Attacks of 26/11. Having said that, the truth remains that RGV's latest Satya 2 is nowhere less than a RGV Ki Aag in terms of content as well as execution, but still the maverick has always bounced back in the past and who knows he may do the same in the next few years surprising us allonce again." 
" plsssssssssss don't watch!!!!!!!!!!!","Is this the same guy who made Satya???????????? Or did his assistant make the first one????????????Where did he get his cast from? Looks like he just went out and screamed I am making Satya 2 I want people who look like characters in my first part. If you don't know acting no problem, I don't care. The weirder you look the better role you get...Who wrote the script/story-line. The whole movie is a joke... I am not sure how this got a rating of 6.2 on IMDb... the only reason I am writing this review is, because I saw this movie because of this 6.2 rating.. This is my first review on IMDb and I wouldn't have done so if this was such frustrating movie.Does the hero actually sound like this or something was put in his throat. Its was Shakti Kapoor trying to be Amitabh of Agnipath... only sound no conviction in dialogues....From the narrative, to the kiddish stories to the worst acting I have ever seen, guys please don't waste your time watching this. Each and every character will make you squirm. Ramu was this really you???I really think the first three reviews on IMDb are people who want other s to see this movie and make them hate RAmu for life."
