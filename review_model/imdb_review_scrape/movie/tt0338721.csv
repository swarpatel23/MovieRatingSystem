" Crap","This is similar to FOOTPATH and many filmsThe film is a usual action movie trying to promote Vinod Kambli as an actor, who fails The film is bad The Suneil Shetty track which is important is suddenly killed before climax and a guest role Sanjay Dutt is made the hero Sanju's role itself is stupid Directorally Ravi Dewan seems stuck in old genre Music is okaySanjay Dutt looks bored in a small role Suneil Shetty exaggerates his part too much, his constant sniffing and his hand act is bad otherwise his act is okay at places Ashutosh underplays his part well Vinod Kambli is bad Preeti Jhaignani is horrible Gautam Rode is passable" 
" bad","bad movie it is. please don't waste your time by watching this movie. for all fans of kambli he did a good job but not as good as he did when he was playing. Selectors, please take him back in the team although we have already too many (good) batsmen in our team." 
" Ravi Dewan-Sunil Shetty combo fails big time","Sunil Shetty was a major action hero in the 1990s period but he is no longer the crowd puller of the 1990s. His cult action movies like Anth, Gopi Kishan, Rakshak, Krishna, Sapoot, Vinashak, and several more were commercial successes. Most of these films had action directed by Ravi Dewan. Ravi Dewan also directed the cult action film, Vinashak. However, the Ravi-Dewan-Sunil Shetty combo has failed to succeed.Annarth is a typical action film in which cricketer Vinod Kambli tries to make a mark in Bollywood. However, very little (including Vinod Kambli) works in the movie. Annarth tries to show the Mumbai underworld but the entire movie is way too filmy and over the top. The movie is about gangsters, Jimmy and Raghav, in Mumbai. Raghav is a hardcore don while Jimmy is a golden hearted criminal. Jimmy disapproves of Raghav's methods and there is a great deal of bitterness among the two. Jimmy makes a friend in a bar called Sameer who doesn't seem to be what he poses as. Sameer later falls in love with his childhood friend Preeti. Sammer introduces Jimmy to his friend Bandya who later joins Raghav's gang. What follows are lots of predictable twists and turns; the only shocking twist is the sudden death of Jimmy right before the climax.Direction by Ravi Dewan is a major disappointment; he has chosen a decent concept but he has failed to turn this concept into good cinema. The film keeps dragging and it gets boring after the interval. The worst thing is the fact that Sunil Shetty gets killed suddenly towards the end and Sanjay Dutt's character is made the central element. Sanjay Dutt's character itself is random and it wasn't required in the first place.Sunil Shetty disappoints big time with his overacting but is still functional. He was a lot better in Vinashak but here, he fails to perform. I am a big fan of Sunil Shetty and he is usually good in any action movie but here he is not in his element. Ravi Dewan should have given him a better role and he should have been alive for the climax. Sanjay Dutt is alright in a stupid role. He is given the unnecessary importance in the climax but he manages to do alright. Gautam Rode is alright but Vinod Kambli is wasted badly. Ashutosh Rana is good but it's nothing new, he was a lot better in Dushman and Sangharsh. Preeti Jhangiani is pretty average.Action directed by Ravi Dewan is average while none of the songs are memorable. On the whole, Annarth is a major disappointment. At the box office, it was a big flop; it was unable to recover its costs let alone making profits." 
" I don't think its worth except for sanjay dutt","This is a not so remarkable underworld story, intermingled with some romance and sub standard comedy. There is weak acting, an unimpressive music score, goofs and not so good action. The editing is so bad, scenes are not joined well.The only noteworthy thing about this film is Sanjay Dutt's role-he does a good job as the understanding Iqbal bhai, and the newcomer Gautam Rode's well built body. I think the newcomers made their debut in this flick and never came back again to bollywood.Why do people make such films? And why does suniel shetty accept only such films?"
