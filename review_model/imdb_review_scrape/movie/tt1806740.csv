" Nail biting suspense till the last second","I watched this film at the Washington D.C screening during the World and Music and Independent Film Festival in August, and really impressed with the plot, and storyline. The film revolves around a group of average people who share a dark secret, something they have done in their past to harm an innocent person. I should add that this film is not about September 11, as the title may suggest to some (I was relieved). Sometimes people commit crimes without realizing the consequences of their actions, this film shows how our actions could go horribly wrong, and cause grave damage to another individual. The scrip is pretty good, and so are the dialogs. The film is in Hindi with English Sub-Titles for non-Hindi speakers. The best part of the film is, you can figure out the film without relying on the sub-titles. I spoke with a couple of fellow audience members (non-indian), and they were equally impressed. This in an independent film, but the quality is anything but independent. I wish the Director, and all the actors lots of success for the future. I highly recommend this film."
