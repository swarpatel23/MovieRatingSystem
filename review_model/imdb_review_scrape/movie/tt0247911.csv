" Boy meets girl, father disapproves.......","When I find myself reaching for the fast forward button right at the beginning of a film I know it won't be the last time. I LOVE Hrithik Roshan so I can even forgive him for this film for reasons explained later in this humble review.The story is of a young college student (Hrithik) who sees a young girl(Amesha) in a car and falls in love with her . Hrithik's character goes out of his way to meet her & when they eventually meet at her house, his love is reciprocated but the girl is kept under house arrest by her father who has violent criminal connections. Hrithik's character again goes out of his way help her & manages to spirit her away from the house for some time alone. There are some very long dance sequences and ultimately there may be a happy ending but with much violence and upset along the way. And much exposure of Hrithik's muscles (particularly toward the end).This review is just my opinion and I always say it is best to make up your own mind if you're going to watch a film, so of course people will read it and disagree, that's only right. However I feel so sorry for Hrithik in this one. I don't know who choreographed his first dance sequence, immediately after the films costume designer kitted him out in some very dainty shorts for him to skip up the football pitch - but they should have been shot with the rest of the criminals in the first gun-fight.I can only think after the success of K.K.K.G that someone wanted to make a fast rupee or two out of Hrithik & the choice to do the film was out of his hands. In my opinion he was given poor dialogue, poor choreography & poor action to deliver and unfortunately for my number one Bollywood star the end result was poor too." 
" A bit of a disappointment","This could have been a good movie, but wasn't. I mostly blame this on Amisha Patel. I don't really like her as an actress ordinarily but her hysterical act in this movie reminded me of someone having an asthma attack, I kept expecting her to get an inhaler out. Hrithik is good, so if you're a fan then see this movie. It's very clich√©d, the typical 'poor boy meets rich girl and rich girls father does everything to get rid of boy' movie which has been done a lot better in many other movies. In my opinion Deewaanapan which basically had the same plot was much better. For one thing, the actress didn't annoy me so much with her heavy breathing. Don't watch the movie if you're not a fan of Hrithik." 
" A complete disaster, with a daft script","Aap mujhe achche lagne lage was a super flop in the box office all over the world. It tells the story of a boy meets girl, falls in love, but her family are not happy for some reason. At the end the boy gets beaten up by her family of goons, but suddenly does some exercise and beats up all 100 of the goons by himself. He saves the day and lives happily ever after. We have seen this kind of story in a million Bollywood films already. This is one of the worst versions of a off repeated script. Forget fairy tales, this is a rough scrap movie, with two popular actors casted to make money out of the audience. Do not spend money buying this movie is the advice i will give. Hritek Roshan delivers a disgraceful performance and is one of the most overrated actors in Bollywood (two or three good films). Amisha Patel is so sexy with a amazing figure, but even she couldn't save the movie from being the Worst film of the year. She gives an annoying performance as the scared girl that keeps heavy breathing all the time. It really got on my nerves. This is a complete nonsense movie, with some disgraceful action scenes coming from a good director." 
" Stay away..don't make the same mistake i did!!!","One of my very worst movie experience. Amisha Patel is a horrible actress and the generic story of an average Joe falling in love with the gangster's daughter and fighting all odds to be united in love certainly didn't help. Rarely does one come across a movie with absolutely no redeeming qualities. And I take offense to the suggestion that this movie is in any way reflective of the "magic of Bollywood". The movie was hardly a fairytale and really has no place in today's day and age.I couldn't wait for the movie to end or Amisha Patel's character to just die." 
" 5 reasons to watch and not watch this movie","5 reasons to watch this movie: 1-Hrithik Roshan 2-Amisha Patel (if you're a fan) 3-Contains references to 'Kaho na Pyaar Hai', have fun picking them out! 4-The guy gets the girl...what more do you want from a Bollywood movie? 5-Hrithik Roshan5 reasons NOT to watch this movie: 1-Bad acting 2-Lame plot and screen writing 3-You will feel the need to kill Amisha Patel's character because she is such a moron... 4-Remember 'Mujse Dosti Karogi' and 'Koi Mil Giya'? Hrithik Roshan seems to pull characteristics out of both those movies and combines them into a psychopathical retard! 5-Amisha and Hrithik have zilch chemistry" 
" Hey, this was a great movie!","I have to disagree with Andrea (butterflitter) on this movie, and yet it is typical for Bollywood that you will see these two extreme kinds of comments. Read the comments before watching the movie, because you have to have the right expectations to really enjoy it.Welcome to the magic of Bollywood! These are fairy-tales of Princesses and Princes, take and enjoy them for what they are. Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage is a wonderful specimen of this genre, where you can cry with the heroine and at every point you know that all will be well that ends well.Amisha Patel is absolutely gorgeous. And if you don't understand that she must act hysterical, you have not understood Bollywood! Also -- to Amisha's defense -- her character is indeed supposed to have asthma! The scene that explained this was cut out during final editing, but you might have picked up sister-in-law's comments that she would have finally been able to "breathe freely" etc. So, the fact that Andrea has diagnosed this asthma means that Amisha has done a great job in this role.This movie has lots of parallels to Gadar, and you should watch Gadar as well if you like a similar plot set in a historic background (Partition), and have adorable Amisha Patel again." 
" Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage","Honestley this movie really sucked , honestly! amishas acting was odd when she was crying in the movie i thought something was wrong with her. It looked like she gasping for air her acting sucked. Hrithik of course was great he really fit the part of Rohit. His character was a simple boy in college who is also a great soccer player. The beginning of the movie looked like it was going to be great but sadly i think the only thing great about this movie was when hrithik had that soccer match and he won. The songs were OK i didn't really like most of the songs. Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon in my opinion was way better then this film. I liked Prem Ki Diwani Hoon. Amisha Patel is annoying as usual i like her but yet i can't stand her! But i did not judge the movie because i i'm not sure if i like her or not. The movie was just bad that's all!! the ending i felt was cut off they should have added more to the ending. I actually waited a bit to see if they really ended it like that! i rate this movie a 6/10!HORRIBLE! i would recommend watching Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon. Because Kareena and Hrithik have a lot more chemistry and the story line is better!!oh and if you stll want to watch this movie even after al the boredom you are going to experience and the fact that this movie is really a smelly cut of cheese!! then go on right ahead because it's your opinion but still take my advice this movie is not worth watching , A huge waste of time, if you have time to waste.Please don't buy the movie it's a waste of money. i love hrithik but dang a bad movie is a bad movie and that is exactly what this movie is BAD.B-A-D BAAAD!!!Awful!!so watch this movie if you dare!! but you couldn't even dare me or pay me to watch this movie again.AWWWWW the HORROR!!! and i am NOT overeacting this movie is a huge BOMB and no one should try to make it explode again!" 
" superb,excellent and totally flawless","Now before starting this comment i want to say that i am new on IMDb as review writer and i have also read many comments on this movie and i found them awful, are you people silly.This is a great Hindi movie with flawless acting by charming Hrithik and beautiful Amisha not because shes my favorite actress but because she has all the ingredients of the great actress and the story is although simple but the actors expressions especially of Amisha are fantastic without doubt and some body wrote about Hrithiks bad choreography are you mad man his dance number Hawaon Ne Yeh Kaha includes his best dance of his career so you have to believe me that it is one of the better love stories made in Hindi cinema because Dil Wale Dulhania and Hum Tum or movies like Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak are also simple love stories but they are so much hit films so why not this one if you are still confused then go and see App Mujhe Ache Lagne Lage once more to believe me and finally this along with Kal Ho Na Ho and 3 idiots is my favorite film so please go and watch it once more." 
" No even Hrithik could save this!","I have NOT fallen in love with this film, I haven't begun to like it either. I agree with everybody else who has given this film just two stars. The story is just too typical and unrealistic and annoying. I only watched it because of gorgeous Hrithik but Amisha Patel's over-acting and melodrama killed it in a very bad way. The music is just passable, nothing special. Hrithik and Amisha are both great dancers and share an impeccable chemistry but none of that could save the horrible plot. How many times are we gonna see people act mean and atrocious and then apologize and everything will be honky dory after dragging us through 3 hours of hell. It's unjustifiable unless the script is solid and this one was sub-par. UGH!"
