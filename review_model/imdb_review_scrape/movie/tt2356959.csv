" Neither Ajab nor Gazab","They are some proud fathers who keep trying to launch their flop sons Vashu Bhagnani is one such, so after Kal Kisne Dekha, Faltu now it's Ajab Gazab Love which flopped. The film has an age old concept, of course a remake of a south Indian film SEEMA TAPAKAI [2011] The film does have some funny moments especially Kirron Kher's portions, also Arjun Rampal's portions but overall it's another attempt of producer trying to save son's career which failsDirection is okay Music is decentJackky Bhagnani flaunts his body, tries hard and does show some improvement but nothing much, he hs a long way to go Niddhi is okay, Arjun Rampal in a dual role does quite well Darshan Jhariwala, Kirron Kher are good rest are okay" 
" A typical time pass film","Story line of this movie is good. It could have been easily converted into a good film but lack of logic in screenplay drags it into just a time pass film. All scenes are just stuffed in film to create comedy, drama and emotions but not seamlessly. Director Mr. Sanjay Gadhvi has to take responsibility of this jerk. This movie is somehow designed to show the talent of Jacky Bhagnani. It is a film cum show reel of him but I believe if you want to establish a new person then try to explore his strength rather than pushing him into other shoes, where he is not comfortable. Screenplay is not interesting. Dialogues are good at places. Performance wise Jacky Bhagnani (Hero) is just OK. Nidhi Subbaiah (Heroine) is good. Arjun Rampal and Darshan Jariwala(Father) are impressive. Kirron Kher is lovable. Arshad Warsi appears in cameo and sparks the comedy. He compels you to laugh. Music by Sajid Wajid and lyrics are bad. It is up to the level of noise. After all, if you are getting really bore then try it. Few scenes will make you at least smile for sure." 
" A simple family film which can be seen once for its emotions, songs and Darshan Jariwala.","We all truly love the simple yet impactful cinema of HRISHIKESH MUKHERJEE without any exception. But at the same time we also somehow believe that its quite hard to re-create the similar kind of ambiance in a film today, due to 'the changed world' around us which values things more than our emotions. As a result whenever any such simple meaningful comedy is attempted by a director, it at once gets compared with all those classic, life teaching films from the maestro in an avoidable manner. And since it is extremely difficult to bring that Hrishi Da magic again, the attempt (most of the times) is considered to be pretty weak and average in comparison.Now the same problem is faced by this week's AJAB GAZABB LOVE, if you start comparing it with a Hrishikesh Mukherjee film needlessly. But if one can move out of that set parameter of judging (without wearing any logical thinking caps) then the film easily becomes a sweet simple attempt, which can surely be watched once for its emotions, good songs and a lovable act by Darshan Jariwala. Originally a remake of Telugu film SEEMA TAPAKAI (2011), AGL is directed by Sanjay Gadhvi and revolves around the story of a rich boy who plans a scheme to win over a beautiful girl who actually hates the "Rich & the Famous" section of the society.Starting off with a perfect catchy party number sung by Mika (Boom Boom), the script does have few good sequences both in its first and second half providing the required entertainment to the viewers. But in actual terms AGL manages to hold your attention mainly due to its 4 good songs, a fresh photogenic female lead and few good performances from the cast as required. In fact these are exactly the few factors which eventually save the film from being called a pretty ordinary venture. And with a better climax, different from the present hushed-up one, AGL could have been a much better family film altogether.Nevertheless, along with its melodious soundtrack, AGL needs to be given a chance at least for its enjoyable scenes featuring Darshan Jariwala, Kiron Kher and Arshad Warsi. Where Kiron and Arshad successfully make you smile with their hilarious acts, Darshan Jariwala truly enacts the ironies of life lived by a rich person, unable to cherish the finer things existing around him due to his own chosen lifestyle. Unarguably its one of finest performances by the veteran character actor till date, full of insightful love and emotions deserving praises.Jackyy is surely improving with each new film of his and in AGL he takes one step further looking better. But since the script has too many characters moving on the screen, his sincere efforts get overshadowed unintentionally. Arjun Rampal is fine playing a double role of two brothers who needed a better characterization to be fair. The new entrant Nidhi has got the oomph factor and looks hot on the screen in some chosen outfits reminding you of the beautiful Sangeeta Bijalani of the 80s. She is the same girl who played a small role of a press reporter in OH MY GOD just few weeks back and looked stunning in that too. However Nidhi still needs to work on presenting herself better on the screen as I felt.The best feature of the film remain Sajid Wajid, who are in their full form here with four good songs in the soundtrack lead by "Boom Bomm" and "Tu". Particularly I simply loved the base line in the song "Tu" which is also smartly used in the film's Background Score. All the tracks are well supported by an eye-catching cinematography and great choreography which don't really allow you to go out the theater breaking the normal routine.On the whole, AJAB GAZABB LOVE works decently due to its Hrishi Da or Frank Capra kind of plot, a pleasing soundtrack and few loving performances. Its not a great or perfect film for sure but a lot better than the usual routine ventures with the big names." 
" Just for entertainment","Well, the plot revolves around the usual romantic comedy movies of all time. There is no new plot that one movie-goer would appreciate about. Some sequences make you laugh while some make you empathize!Not much of a blockbuster love with poor acting skills by the newbie actress. Yet, the remaining cast tries to achieve some thespian charisma! The family is chubby and the whole drama takes some serious breakdown towards the end of the movie!Bottom line: Same old story with same old tactics!The whole film is predictive and leaves nothing much for the watcher to await or get thrilled. If you have nothing to do, go watch it for the bananas' sake!" 
" One Time Watch","Ajab Gazabb love Rating- ** 1/2 I went in the theatre with huge expectations from Ajab Gazabb Love after all it's the remake of one of the best Telugu comedies ever made 'Seema Tapakai' and also it has been directed by the Director who gave us the Dhoom franchise, Sanjay Gadhvi, and I came out with a small,little smile on my face. First of all, let me make it clear- this is nothing pathbreaking or record breaking stuff. It actually tries too hard to be funny at some places. WARNING- THE FIRST HALF IS SO BORING THAT YOU MIGHT JUST WALK OUT, well thats what I felt like, But being a reviewer I had to sit through the second half which did not disappoint at all. The second half has plenty of rib-tickling funny moments and crazy situations. The story is about Rajveer (Jackky Bhagnani) a spoilt son of a rich businessman who falls in love with Madhuri (Nidhi Subbaia) who is a young advocate of equality and injustice among poor people. Clearly, she hates rich people. To impress her, Rajveer lies that he is poor. And then, his family starts acting as a bunch of illiterate and poor people. Sometimes, taking it too far. Arjun Rampal plays Madhuri's (Nidhi) strict and full of anger big brother. He is seen in a role same as his role in the 2010 mega hit 'Housefull.' The direction is So-So but one expects more from the 'Dhoom' director Sanjay Gadhvi. The music by Sajid-Wajid is good and fits into the movie like a diamond in a ring! The acting by Jackky Bhagnani is good, the newcomer Nidhi Subbaiah gives a nice effort though she had not much to do thanks to the Screenplay. Kirron Kher is awesome as always, so is Darshan Jariwala. Arjun Rampal, just like Nidhi Subbaiah has nothing much to do other than scaring the family members but he does well. The show stealer is Arshad Warsi with his cameo. His expressions make you burst into laughter. Overall, a good effort, could have been better if the the first half was good where most of the gags fall flat. Final Verdict- One-Time watch if you love rom-com's!"
