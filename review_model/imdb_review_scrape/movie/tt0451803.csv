" Funny!","This movie is so funny! Salman is funny, Sohail is funny, Katarina is funny! Sushmita is definitely a scene stealer...I loved the scene where the good doctor takes her out to dinner and she dictates her daily activities. The Laga Laga song was also nice. Sushmita Sen is lucky to have such a statuesque and graceful figure. The rivalry of Salman and Sohail was hilarious! Salman's character was a terrible liar. I guess the moral of the story is not to lie because one lie invariably leads to the next until the person is trapped in a web of deceit. The myriad of lies that form the the plot definitely are responsible for the many comical moments. I saw this one in the there with my friend Raaes. (thanks for keeping in touch, hope you are studying in Toronto). I miss our fights...you still have to learn the proper technique of how to cut onions. Anyways this is a movie review. More comedy please!!!" 
" MP2K - Laugh Riot","If you have been working or studying too hard, or even going through a rough patch in life, let your brain take a vacation. And go watch Maine Pyar 'Kyun' Kiya (MP2K). There were no surprises for me at the movie... A David Dhawan movie! I knew exactly what to expect.Now time for spoilers... The movie is a medley of a lot of other movies. Salman recreates the madness of Biwi No 1. IMHO, Sallu should stick with comedy. He makes you laugh even though it is at his own expense. Sohail Khan imitates some of the old Sallu comic roles. He was very adorable in this movie. He's a lot better than he was in Lakeer and Krishna Cottage. Katrina Kaif is just eye-candy. She does not know how to act. If the director or producer where expecting to cash in on Sallu-Kat off-screen romance, it really did not work. Like most real life couples, even Sallu and Kat don't have much of a chemistry on-screen. She should just walk the ramps and not waste her time in Bollywood. Maybe an item number once a while is all she should try to do. Sush sizzles beyond compare!! After Main Hoon Na and MP2K, Sush is emerging as a gorgeous, sexy and humorous actress. She looks graceful in a Saree and carries out her role with so much ease. The special appearances by Arshad Warsi and Isha Koppikar also adds some masala.The movie has a slightly different angle than the regular Hindi movie. A Casanova doctor (Sallu) who claims to have a wife to avoid women asking for commitment... When he finally meets "the one" (Kat), all his lies return to haunt him. To cover up one lie, he builds a mountain of other lies. He finds a fake wife in his nurse (Sush) who brings two kids also into the equation and a trail of other boyfriends. A struggling actor (Sohail) is always there to save the damsel (Kat) in distress. The mayhem and madness peaks half way through the movie when Sallu's mom turns up in the fake court during his fake divorce and accepts his fake wife Sush as her real bahu.... The rest of the movie is all about how Sallu tries to kick Sush out of his life and how finally "Love conquers all"!!! All in all, total entertainer. Watch it once. Don't try to find logic or reason... And oh yeah, the songs!! They are just totally foot tapping. I think that a movie is not a success by just having a great story or cast or direction or winning awards... it is by moving people into some extreme emotion. Something that makes you laugh so hard that you cry or something that makes you cry so hard that you will laugh at the dumbest of jokes..." 
" Great Movie","Well, this was my first experience with a true "Bollywood" movie. I previously had seen Bend It Like Beckham, and the recently released Bride and Prejudice. I had been wanting to open myself up to new experiences and culture, and of hearing of a lot of the "Bollywood" movies having dancing and musicals, I was interested. I ended up seeing the movie twice, after seeing some of the trailers. I enjoyed the songs, such as "Just Chill" and "Wanna Spend The Rest Of My Life With You". The movie has very vivid colors, as well as great scenery and great music. I was very impressed and decided to see it a second time. It was a little longer than what most movies are, but they did have an intermission in the movie. I plan to get it on DVD, when it comes out, as well as possibly the soundtrack. If you are interested in seeing the movie, I would highly recommend it." 
" Hilarious comedy....good time pass","Nice movie...just that Salman Khan as always is over acting. Rest the movie is fine and a good time pass. Some moments are real funny and,still laughing from them... Story is nothing special but the sets and outdoor shooting is very nice.Songs are nice and melodious. I think the movie just needed more stronger story line..at points it seems to be a copy of some old film.But a nice copy its a nice time pass and a fun filled movie. Those who have time to spare can see it.All in all a movie which makes you laugh. I think it will do better in India than in the rest of the world because of the desi storyline." 
" So funny","I really loved this movie, i remember when it first came out out the cinema a couple of years ago, so i decided to go and watch it.Sameer ( who is played by Salman Khan) is a Doctor and only day he meets Sonia (Katrina Kaif), but he tells her that he is married and she wants to meet his wife, then kids and then his mother. Now Sallu played his role excellent but Katrina was really, really bad in this movie? why did the director David Dhawan cast her? she clearly was not right for the part, Arshad Warshi and Isha Koppiker were also really good in this film and not to mention Sushmita, she was just brilliant, totally right for the part and played it extremely well, the music is just great too also. My favourite character would have to be the mother, now i don't want to give too much away but she was very good in the film, so funny, every time she came on screen i would burst out laughing like a 5 year old cause she was that funny, the story was crap and the ending was a bit dull and boring i think but it is a very funny film, so it's kinda worth the watch." 
" Nice film","Nice comedy movie with happy ending. Sushmita looking very beautiful in the film. Salman movie family entertainer" 
" Superhit film","I totally enjoyed watching this comedy film it's so hilarious Salman khan was superb salmans brother was great after his debut film release Katrina did fine other character artists did spectacular performances I love the songs of this film there unstoppable Don't miss this blockbuster it's decent family entertainer My rating 8/10 or 4/5 stars" 
" must watch","I watched this movie the opening weekend because I am a die-hard Salman Khan fan. I expected a lot from this movie but it surpassed my expectations! This movie is going to make you laugh forever! Salman Khan gives a fabulous performance like always he has perfect comic timing. Sushmita Sen is so pretty and hot. She makes a GREAT couple with Salman Khan even though he's shorter. Katrina Kaif is so cute she looks like a nice girl n cute couple with Salman Khan. Sohail Khan is funny like in a stupid funny way. And Arshad Warsi is so funny like always! The mom is really funny you gotta watch out for her. so all in all I recommend this movie to go and watch it only in the big screen because its more fun to watch. Or on DVD but not in the pirated videotapes because they cut out all the funny scenes and good songs. OK thats all and please and please go watch this movie! You wont regret it one bit!" 
" this was a gr8 movie","This movie was so funny Salman's acting is so funny. he was best suited 4 this role along with Arshad. just 1 little thing but it totally copied a bit of the ending from the final episode of friends which was a shock after just seeing that episode to be watching a Indian comedy and suddenly that same bit comes up with different actors and actresses LOL anyways despite this it was a really good film n everyone acted really good i would say no entry, Masti and this film are some of the best comedy movies ever! Salman khan makes this a enjoyable film to watch. You know what you have to make these comments so long. Anyway Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya is a great film! there is that enough now?" 
" Albeit its shortcomings, Laughter Guaranteed.","Plot Outline: Samir (Salman), a doctor by profession and a flirt by hobby; is in love with Sonia (Katrina) but has unfortunately lied to her that he was already married. Trouble brews when Sonia airs her intentions to meet the alleged wife. Samir approaches his dutiful nurse Naina (Sushmita) to play 'wife' in a drama that turns out into a comedy of errors. Also involved are characters of Rajpal Yadav, Sohail Khan & Arshad Warsi.Comment: David Dhavan returns again with his comedies and mixed relationships after his last Mujhse Shadi Karogi which was a poor copy-paste of Hollywood's Anger Management. Although the story has nothing vis-Ã -vis the typical Bollywood, the execution is neat. However, I felt Kya Kool was a better comedy this year.The movie's negatives and positives emanate from the Actors themselves. Although Salman has done a good job trying to understand why he fell in love (after he probably fell in love during Maine Pyar Kiya in 1989), I found it difficult to see him play Doctor on screen. His brother, supposedly in a comical role is painfully irritating on screen. Other two noted comedians could've done better if their roles were scripted better. Katrina looks lovely, and Sushmita's neat. Music: 'Just chill' makes a good ring tone.Rating: 3/5" 
" Hollywood ripoff","Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya is copied right off from the 1969 Hollywood classic, Cactus Flower starring Walter Mathau, Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Such a pity. Who would have ever thought that the Bollywood industry would ever stoop down to the lack of new ideas and concepts..... again... Every word for word, they just translated the whole script, thats all. There must surely have been no need to do any character research, no direction notes. David Dhawan must have just watched the necessary scene of cactus flower while shooting for the exact same shot on the sets of Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya. such a pity. I hope the Indian film industry gets some fresh ideas coz its getting too musty to breathe in here." 
" A no-brainer, total nonsense masala movie","Turned out to be exactly as I expected: A no-brainer, total nonsense masala movie. Exactly what we expect from David Dhawan(DD). But I don't mean any of it in a bad way, coz the movie never tries to be anything more, and in its silliness and absurdity, works well for the comedy genre, while sticking very much within the confines of clichÃ©d family entertainment.The excuse for a story revolves around a bachelor Casanova Doctor (Salman Khan) in love with a model (Katrina Kaif). But to leave the relationship just to an affair, he tells her he is already married. When she insists on meeting the Wife, he ropes in his ever-doting Nurse (Sushmita Sen) as his fake wife. We also have Arshad Warsi play a sidekick/friend to the doctor, and Sohail Khan as Katrina's intervening neighbor.As usual, DD defies all logic and intelligence for a movie that is out of his assembly line. It is not one of his best, but definitely better than the mediocre ones he has made us suffer. The comedy is not loud (except for the Rajpal Yadav scenes) and works mostly, especially with Salman and Arshad translating it with their impeccable timing. Sushmita Sen is her usual warm self. Katrina Kaif is a Bombshell, looking every bit as gorgeous as made out to be. And even though she hardly acts, she never comes across as plastic. Sohail Khan is forgettable at best and annoying at worst.If you are getting bored and have three hours to spare, you'll have a good time watching this instead." 
" Simple and good timepass","Not a bad film. Sushmita did a good acting as per as her role. Not a bad film" 
" A comedy film that stays true to its intentions","David dhawan don't give us a great story or great film but what he gives is entertainment. In this film you will laugh at the situations and the dialogues. Acting of all the stars are very good. Terrific comedy timings. A wholesome entertainer." 
" Disappointing","This movie was disappointing. After making a good comedy movie like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, I was expecting it to be a good movie but it turned out to be a garbage. What a bad acting by Salman Khan and Sohail Khan. Even Katrina's acting was very poor. Sushmita was okay. Arshad Warsi and Rajpal Yadav were wasted. I can't understand how people liked this movie overlooking bad acting by the Khan brothers. I just could not sit till the end of this movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I am cursing the person who actually recommended this movie to me. From now on, I am going to be very careful in watching David Dhawan's movies." 
" An Awful Movie that is better best forgotten!","this movie directed by comedy king David Dhawan is one reason i thought would bring a smile to my face on a hot summer's day.It kinda did but the gap between one smile to another was a bit too big for my comfort.It is awful to say the least with woeful performances that'll make you shudder and make you wish that u had stayed back home.Salman and his brothers were wasted while Katrina needs a lifeline(read:end of the movie) to be bailed out.Sushmita Sen passes muster while Rajpal Yadav belts out a over the top performance.The only relief comes in the form of Arshad Warsi(he scores again) who is in good form . My advice would be stay away from this doctor-patient movie as far as you can because it just might give you the blues!!"
