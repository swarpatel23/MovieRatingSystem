" Has got nothing except the refreshing Diya Mirza.","An avid lover of English movies must be well familiar with the fascination Hollywood has towards stories based on Dead Persons, Ghosts, Spirits or People coming from the unknown world. Walking on a similar path Bollywood's Hum Tum Aur Ghost also falls in the same category getting its main inspiration from the famous movies "Ghost Town" (2008) & "Ghost" (1990). But unfortunately, it remains just another mediocre inspired movie on an exciting subject which completely fails to impress the viewer from any angle.Talking about a fashion photographer who is able to see and talk to dead people, the movie starts off in a very lethargic manner, which takes the viewer by surprise since it was more publicized as a comedy featuring Arshad Warsi, better known for his incomparable comic timing. In fact that's the biggest slip-up made on the part of its publicity campaign, which mainly gave out the idea of it being a different laugh riot dealing with the dead, where as in reality the movie had nothing to be referred as Comedy. In the recent past, we have seen many projects being rejected due to their wrong publicity campaign and HTAG becomes the latest victim of the same.A simple question in this respect would be that "Why to cut promos showcasing Arshad's comic skills, when he is doing nothing of that sort in the whole movie?" And as an answer to that, it's a pure indication of trying to fetch some extra initial in the opening weekend with a deliberate and faulty kind of publicity campaign.Content wise, the pre and post interval impact of the movie is pretty same with nothing exceptional or worth enjoying happening on the screen. All the scenes dealing with the dead people seeking help from Arshad are treated very unexcitingly. The various stories about the past happenings with the ghosts have got nothing new to offer to the viewers. Furthermore, the movie ends with an entirely bizarre sequence (about the identity of a small boy), which even tempts you to find out who the actual writers are, responsible for this weird thought incorporated in the climax. In reality, the writers seem to be absolutely gone out of ideas in the entire screenplay as there is not a single enjoyable scene in the whole movie. It just ends as it starts without caring to provide any sort of entertainment to the viewers.However the only refreshing element in it remains, the gorgeous Diya Mirza who pleasantly looks very charming, lovable and cool in her well chosen dresses and also comes up with a decently performed act of a fashion magazine editor. Otherwise, HTAG is a perfect example of a huge ensemble of talent wasted in a messy way. Arshad Warsi sincerely tries hard to present a make believe kind of act, but does not get the much needed support from the script. Boman Irani is excellent as the needy ghost and Sandhya Mridul is immensely confident as always. But Javed Sheikh, Shernaz Patel and Tinnu Anand have nothing substantial written for them to perform.Technically the film shines bright with its noticeable camera-work and art direction. But musically it is not capable of creating any ripples in the market. Shankar Ehsaan Loy have delivered only a routine soundtrack for the movie, which has no melody in it. Director Kabeer Kaushik did show some sparks in his first venture "Sehar", but in his latest, he seems to be totally confused between different genres of Comedy, Drama & Horror. HTAG is no way close to any of his previous movies based on crime or may be the news of his clashes with the producers was in turn responsible for this half hearted uninteresting product from the director." 
" A romantic horror!","I have not seen this type of movie in bollywood before. Hollywood had this type of very successful movies before,but i have to say a very brave attempt by Kabeer Kaushik and Arshad Warsi duo. Now to tell how was the movie.It don't have the star power but some how i liked it.Acting of Arshad and Boman Irani was to watch really.Others were just trying to hold on to their roll. Music wasn't that good.but it wasn't bad either. I thought from the title that there will be a lot of visual effect,but actually there wasn't many.but i liked the good car scene at last. If u want to spent your time with some refreshing entertainment i think you can watch this movie.and this movie is totally for every ages(which has become very rare now day)." 
" Good idea, not so good presentation","I watched the movie for I read somewhere that it was shot in Newcastle Upon Tyne. But I must say that even though my primary attention was at the vistas and locations, the plot got me glued for a while. To say the least, Boman and Arshad acted, as usual, above par. Dia Mirza's character, if I may say so, seemed to be half cooked; and that coupled with her miserable acting, played the weakest link, which, I think, ripped the film apart. There are certain scenes in which her character, coupled with her acting, simply becomes unbearable. Arshad, although, sometimes jumps the fine line between acting and over acting, but, I suppose, he knows the art of handling over acting well- courtesy Circuit. Overall, a nice story line, which could have been presented in a better way." 
" Hum Tum aur Audience","At the outset let me tell you that "Hum Tum Aur Ghost" is safe for one- time watch. Sooner than later I am sure this will get aired on telly and don't miss it then. It has a decent story-line and a fair share of laughs are thrown in for good measure. Arshad Warsi:: He was cool in the character of Armaan Suri. The alcoholic, scared, Samaritan, lover boy - he managed it all with ease. Luckily he did not succumb to overdose of one-liners. I especially liked when poked at Maria Goretti. Diya Mirza:: She was fresh and complimented Arshad Warsi quite nicely.Boman Irani:: At first I thought the character will be similar to the ghost from "Chamatkar". For the length of the role he had, he was alright. And largely his plot seemed like mini-me of "Baghbaan". Sandhya Mridul:: Just about OK. And the truth was kind of coming.Javed Sheikh, Asawari Joshi, Tinnu Anand were adequate. Shernaz Patel plot was not warranted. In fact when that angle sets in, it starts giving deja vu of Karthik Calling Karthik. The plot could have easily based in any metro city in India and perhaps made the audience connect better. There was absolutely no value-addition in setting the story abroad.Songs are hummable." 
" A funny horror","The film is actually based on the departed souls that were unable to fulfill their desires. arshad warsi who is a photographer and a very fanatic lover of gehna begin to see these souls. The father of gehna think that he has gone mad and advised gehna to seriously think about her decision of marrying him. In fulfilling the wishes of souls arshad met her mother's soul. The overall film story is not so captivating however at the end of the film arshad proved himself a very promising actor. Specially when he met his mother's soul his acting was simply outstanding. He broke into tears when he recalled his trip to GOA and a whole life cycle appeared in front of his eyes. Arshad at his best" 
" shot at a beautiful place in Newcastle Upon Tyne","My review is biased because I am rating purely basing my points on the shooting location. As it was shot in Newcastle (my city) I just adore the film.The story was decent. I like Diya and Arshad is a really good actor. Boman is outstanding as always. Minni plays a great role too.Songs are really nice. I think they also shot a song in Darras Hall Estate. I live there. Wish could be part of the film. Wish could meet up with the crew.Night shooting was really good. Not sure if some scenes were shot in Gateshead too.Wish if I could get the chance to meet up the team somehow, Wish I could turn the clock back.Vishal"
