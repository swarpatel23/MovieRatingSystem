" A Piece Of Art.","There are very few movies that make you wait for their day of release just like a torn lover waits for its lost love for that one last glance and Dev.D was certainly one of them. I just knew I had to watch it the moment I saw breathtaking visuals(The snorricam shots inspired from classics like Requiem for a Dream, Trainspotting) in the trailer itself. The fact that the movie was directed by Mr. Maverick (of new age Indian cinema) got me even more excited. So now when I have seen the movie I am ecstatic because I got more than what I expected. This movie is all about your sense of perception of art. If you find charm in innovative screenplay, extraordinary photography, symbolic scenes and realistic acting you got to love this cinematic masterpiece and if you have a thing for colors, its an icing on the cake! But if you want to see an entertainer which is going to generate temporary emotions, unfortunately, its not for you. All those who find the story unrealistic must understand it is not the portrayal of what happens in love but the most beautiful depiction of what is going through one's mind when one gets/doesn't get love. So, either you will crave for the movie to go on till forever or wait for it to end. Of course, the story line is based on the original Devdas but this contemporary version has its own twists and turns and you better not expect the expected. Abhay Deol is absolutely fantastic.There is not a single scene where one can doubt the authenticity of the character he is playing. Both the new actresses are equally good. Mahie Gill deserves all the applause for doing many a tough scenes with calming ease and expression that can light a fire. Kalki's eyes never lose the innocence in the truest sense thanks to the beautiful portrayal even though her character transcends into one of the highest zones of maturity. I just fell in love with the movie and wanted to see more of the unpredictable series of events through extraordinary musical narration.The only thing which I missed in Dev.D was a bit of soul but that is exactly how it was meant to be." 
" DevD is an 'its own movie'.","This movie is 'not' a remake of Devdas. Probably, Anurag Kashyap wanted to borrow the base story from there, but I repeat if you are a big fan of Devdas then this movie isn't for you. But then again this is one of the most insane movies to come out of Bollywood. You might probably end up with a headache after watching it, but its completely worth it. There are few movies with such exceptional cinematography and music which blends completely with the movie.The characters are well defined, but also over the top. Abhay puts in a real perfect act of a self-sympathetic fool, who drinks and does drugs just in the obsession of Paro. He becomes completely lost and finally ends up in the arms of Chanda. Paro has apparently never known the words 'shy' nor 'blush'. Chanda has seen a lot of pain and is the only character who slowly becomes sure of herself.This movie is more about how they have painted the characters rather than the characters themselves. This is a first in Bollywood and I have never heard such dark, yet at times beautiful music. Its loud at times, but Amit Trivedi's work is a sheer genius one. If you do end up liking the movie, you would give half the credit to the music.Anurag and the entire team have poured in their heart for this movie. Most of the work and the ideas are genuine and is not picked up from some other random movie. It is an 'its own movie'." 
" A Different Gear for Indian Cinema","A movie so great that it simply blows your heads off. Every character is Grey. No one is moral and every body is a victim of circumstances. the film is the pinnacle of movie making. the sheer audacity, rawness, and unrealistically realistic treatment creates magic on screen. and believe me one time is not good enough. songs are unbelievable as well. the characters of paro and chanda are so well written that before dev falls in love with them; u will fall in love with them. and both the ladies have done a remarkable job. mahi gill looks so elegant and an epitome of femininity. kalki has an amazing screen presence. with her earthy and next door girl looks, she will win ur heart and her school girl sexuality is incomparable. anurag is THE BEST director in this country and with a girlfriend like kalki he is a lucky bastard as well. and now we come to the real reason of watching the movie. abhay deol. he has become a cult figure for a lot of his fans. the concept is his and he has completely overshadowed and other devdas that ever was. from now on if anybody will be remembered as devdas, he will be abhay. after 7 movies he has overshadowed many heavyweights in the industry. he looks so natural and confident on screen. and how chilled this guy is can be judged from the fact that at the time of his biggest ever release he is rite now in new york for a welding course." 
" Get ready for contemporary Hindi cinema","Ever thought of going to a 'remake' Hindi movie and getting apprehensive whether it will turn out to be better or as good as the previous, in this case, Devdas? well, here it is. And its not a remake, its much better. The most striking feature of this movie is the part played by Abhay Deol,(guy s got talent) which is simply very subtle and practical. No overacting (unlike any other Hindi hero), no songs around mountains and valleys, no getting emotional over your love (yes, believe me). Just chronological events that takes place with three characters around. Thats it. With a gist of recent events which include the DPS girl blow-job MMS, and the famous Drink n drive BMW mauling case in New Delhi, Anurag Kashyap has proved its possible to relate recent events in Indian cinema, which it lacks today. Never once in the movie you need a toilet break even if u need to pee really bad. Even the boldness in using the words like f*** (which i guess is the first time in commercial Hindi movie)is so well mixed, it never strikes out of the ordinary or routine. Must appreciate- Screenplay, direction, Abahay Deol. Music sucks mostly,( not a very good experiment) except a few times. Overall a very good experience, will be the most appreciated movie of 2009, unless anything else comes up." 
" Awesome, Mindblowing, Realistic : One of the Bollywood Best","The movie is a great depiction of modern world or modern love. The movie is absolutely mind blowing. Abhay Deol delivers his best performance till date and he is definitely in main league of actors now. If there is anyone after Aamir khan who we should credited for his choice of movies, its none other than Abhay Deol. I can blindly spent to watch any of his movies without reading any reviews.Coming back to movie apart from the modern remake of Devdas it explores the modern sexuality. It depicts what is going around and the way youngsters explores their sexual needs. This movie isn't for old age people and they will rate it 1 out of 10 as they wouldn't be able to digest the realism shown in the movie. First part of the movie is very charming and indulging. Though its not a comedy but you laugh every minute because of the hard hitting sexual dialogs and realistic talks. Direction is superb and actors did more than justice to their role. Second half is not as enjoyable as compared to 1st half but still its very enjoyable.This movie may turn out to be a flop in actual as its not a family movie, but i think this is more than commercial. Those who understand cinema needs to applaud it all the way. First time in my life i felt that i actually paid less to watch a movie." 
" Two thumbs up for AK's piece of art.","Well I had been waiting for over two months for this film to release. And It has been worth the wait. Anurag Kashyap's Dev.D is a contemporary take on the immortal Devdas, whose boldness will dazzle you, to say the least. The direction and screenplay, as expected, are top-notch. The music is terrific, and has been used creatively to take the story forward. The performances are excellent too, with Abhay Deol delivering a brave, powerful performance that won't be easy to forget. Mahie Gill and Kalki are very impressive too. Watch this movie also for some gems- Paro going in the fields to get laid with Dev with mattresses tied to her bicycle and Chanda and Dev in the sauna-there are many more I promise. AK has successfully ironed out the flaws in the original Devdas, and that's what makes this dark film also a feel-good film at times. AK has handled sexuality and some real-life incidents (MMS scandal, BMW hit- and-run case) in a very mature manner, without being sensationalist. Don't miss it for anything. Watch it for its sheer audacity."I give a 10/10 and two thumbs up for AK's newest piece of art."" 
" My God ! Is this an Indian movie ?","I've been waiting for this movie since the past 2 months. I had gone to see another movie around 2 months back and there was a poster of Dev. D. It starred Abhay Deol. From that moment, I knew this movie is gonna be one of a kind. It takes place in the modern era. The instances shown in the movie are very life-like. The story deals with a loser ( Abhay Deol ) and how he deals with his life. Its like a modern rip-off from Devdas.Everything about this movie is top notch. Right from the direction to the sets, its stunning. The screenplay is impeccable & the cinematography couldn't get better. The visuals are delightful. The music score is exceptional. Even though it is a slow movie, the pace seems very fast. The editing also is so well done. The dialogues are perfect, used in a really vulgar tone. The story is set in & around Delhi. The locations shown are ideal.I really don't remember the last time I had seen such a good bollywood movie. But this flick is not one that will please all audiences. Only connoisseurs of movies will respect & admire this class act. Hats off to Anurag Kashyap. Legend." 
" Darker version of a modern devdas","Well this was one of the most awaited movies for people who like different kind of cinema.Dev d a story about modern Devdas is a good adaption from the previous versions.The movie setup up in north of India brings up something new and unique as a build up to the character.The story is how a boy destroys his life for his childhood love.The darkness of the movie can be seen after he loses the girl and takes a road to utter disdain and destruction of his life.Dev meets Chanda a prostitute who also falls for his charm.Her story is completely different and well put up.The performance by all the actors is laudable and up to the mark.The camera-work and and direction is excellent and audiences will notice that after they watch the movie.The director makes a very good attempt to create a more dark ambiance once the Dev loses his love.The background score of the movie is good considering the dark ambiance.Drinks,smoke,drugs you will see all this in abundance as it leads to destruction of his life.This is not a movie for people who cant take dark films as it just leaves u a bit sapped after you watch it.Go for Dev D if you want something different from commercial cinema.I would rate the movie a 8/10 and say go for it." 
" A riveting DevD(as) with a quench for more than his morbid soul","Let me helm AK as the new czar of motion picture extravaganza ...With a conforming applaud to the concept visualization by Abhay Deol himself , AK and co-writer Vikramaditya Motwane concoct a tale foretold adding the backdrop and zing of contemporary Ludhiana , Delhi ! The beauty of narrative is that it doesn't speak in dialogs but rather gratifies on the senses of the viewer . The editing is brisk and is noteworthy of its nuances to help add the necessary twists in the plot.Fresh music with loads of it helps to contemplate the emotions of the protagonist.It isn't banal or prudish ..the dialogs are witty and minimalist !For those who have watched the archaic DevDas , it's overwhelming to match "loosely based original characters " to our new era real life DevD( trying to empower his childhood love or trying to understand what love really is ), Paro ( Very Indian but yet liberating and sexually charged and also at par with the ultimate Indian "aadarsh" Bahu agnostics ) , Chandramukhi ( A thumbs up to the Sex industry which preaches what the whole world tries to echo in darkness and unlike the world which then raises fingers of indignation and loathe - CMon India did preach Kamasutra long back )not to forget Chunni( an amiable friend but a pimp of the sorts ).The ensemble has done a worthy job . Newcomer : Mahie Gill easily transitions from a vulnerable lover girl to a mature responsible lady , Kalki Koechlin epitomizes the naiveness of a teenage girl whose social stigmata con-volutes her essence of life into an awry ordeal which she readily accepts and moralizes as a state of "Trying to move on .." And Abhay ( I read him being at someplace learning Wood Carving during the release of this movie ) - ( is purely a treat to watch ..the way he triumphs in being a sole loser who worships Vodka and doesn't chastise himself rather acclimatizes himself to the corner of the world called "SELF" -- the virility shown by his hairy bod -- a pungent antonym to chest waxed embellishments -- 10 kg's lost for this role -- shows the kind of efforts put on screen )All of this with a maverick Director's surreal vision ( trademarks being his liking for water and snow .. he uses them as props and landscaper's to unearth the beauty of the far .. No Smoking had loads of it) is a cinematic milestone in itself ...If your above 18 then go with a heart of redemption, lust , despair striving to the ultimate nemesis with oneself --- you shall be a winner !!!" 
" The movie that earned Kashyap fame!","Dev D is a modern-day interpretation of the classic novel "Devdas" by Sarat Chandra. Dev (Abhay Deol), Paro (Mahi Gill) and Chanda (Kalki Koechlin) of Dev D reflect the sensibilities, conflicts aggression, and independence. Free thought, exuberance and recklessness of the youth of today. A generation that is jammed between eastern roots and western sensibilities. Dev D is set in the rustic and colorful Punjab and also explores the dingy, morbid, dark underbelly of Delhi. From sprawling mustard fields to a riot of neon. Now we have come through various versions of the novel "Devdas", but "Dev. D" is way different than all the others. It's not actually the remake of Devdas, yet it can be said as it has been just inspired by it. There are minor similarities yet the characters are similar in a way. The new Devdas likes to have his vodka with Coke, asks Paro for some nude pictures of herself, chats with Paro through IM, likes to have sex, smokes even during pissing after waking up in the morning & does other various stuffs according to the current trend of Indian Youth. There are so many reasons why "Dev. D" strikes hard on it's viewers. It's a coming of an age cinema of Bollywood. Bollywood never did witnessed any stuff like Dev. D ever before. The soul of the movie lies within it's characters, specially "Dev.D" along with Paro, Chanda & Chunni. The movie also depicts Delhi in a superior way. Anurag Kashyap always trying to do something new & creative with each of his movies. First it was Black Friday, which portrayed some stunning reality behind the blasts in Mumbai in the year 1993, which also made it highly controversial & then it was "No Smoking", which was an attempt of a cult movie, though it failed to express the real message behind the movie. Anurag Kashyap this time does it in a Tarantino style. A love story in a Tarantino way. Now that's something really innovative! He gives an extra-ordinary direction, with keeping in mind to entertain the viewers. The humor of the movie with it's witty one liners keeps the viewers hooked during the first half. Though the second half looses it's momentum a bit, the movie still strikes in a powerful way. Now if we talk about the performances, Abhay Deol is one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Not only he performs well, but what he did in this movie is called "Class Act". Top class act by Abhay. Also the performances by the two of the new-comers is refreshing & amazing. Adding to all the factors above is the music or the score of the movie. That's something different yet again for Bollywood. The track "Emotional Atyachar" is already famous. But the best tracks of the movie are "Ek Hulchul Si" & "Emotional Atyachar (Rock Version)". It would simply blow the mind of the lovers of rock music. Excellent songs & score by Amit Trivedi. The unusual cinematography of the movie gives the movie a different look, yet a dark look. Dev.D is a fantastic movie to be made in Bollywood history. A never before experienced love story with sex, drugs, drinks & lot many stuffs. A classic love story with fantastic performance by Abhay Deol." 
" Extraordinarily Brilliant....","The depiction of a modern day Devdas could not have been done any better then what Anurag Kashyap managed in Dev D through Abhay Deol. The deciphering of the movie in totality, cant really be ascertained in a single viewing. Subtle nuances keep coming up with every viewing, that is very unlike any regular Hindi potboiler but very much like the work of Martin Scorsesse, Coppola and Stanley Kubrick, the directors who have influenced Kashyap a great deal. Few are able to disencumber the wannabe tag of wanting to create something like the illustrious directors, but Anurag crosses this great divide with Dev D. He is truly the best voice in Indian cinema today because he makes a movie for himself first and foremost, (like the other great directors mentioned) and makes it with all his heart and soul. The result of his dedication can be seen in Dev D which is a flawless flick with bluntness that will raise eyebrows in the western world, what to talk of Indian sensibility? Everything is just that perfect in Dev D.Cinematography is delightful & vividly colorful. Delhi has never looked better, looks even better then in Mouna Ragam of Mani Ratnam. Abhay Deol pulls off a remarkable character with consummate ease. The depth and the recklessness and the pain and the disarming smile is very reminiscent of the great performance of Robert De Niro in Raging Bull. Is there is any better young method actor in India, then Abhay Deol? Plain simple, No! In a career spanning just a few films he has shown a repertoire that few actors don't achieve in a lifetime. Kudos, Abhay. Mahi Gill is very competent as a village belle and Kalki Koechlin-just superb. Drugs long seen a taboo in the Indian society, though it remains a rampant problem is dealt with great finesse and audacity in Dev D. People may point this as patronizing drugs but that is not it. He wants to talk about an important social issue and he pulls it off with aplomb. It gives a feeling of hate drugs very reminiscent of Trainspotting, and that is not patronizing but presenting a very important social problem with a difference. The remaining cast is solid and helps in the overall movie compactness. Music by Amit Trivedi is very different from the repetitive bollywood music that we keep churning out. It is fresh and strikingly different from anything that we have heard in Hindi cinema. That this movie is a hit should bolster Anurag's confidence. India, is finally ready for his kind of Cinema as he keeps on saying." 
" Post-modern take on the eternal loser lover of Indian cinema","I am not very familiar with Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's 'Devdas'. I know that it was about a rich bugger from Bengal who drank himself to death over a girl he loved. I also know that there have been several filmed versions of the novella though I'd failed to catch any of them, save a couple of scenes from Sanjay Leela Bhansali's version starring SRK. Anurag Kashyap's reputation for art-house genius aside, it was the standout publicity hoardings, wreaking of seduction and psychedelia that pulled me in -- first day, first show. Picture's up and I am greeted with the playful camaraderie between two kids, with the little boy Dev biting little Paro's hand, followed by a scene in which the same brat argues with his father as to why he cannot address him by his pet name -- Sattu. One resounding slap later and Dev is packed off to London, where he magically evolves into a horny, pot-smoking, i-pod-toting cad (Abhay Deol). The little girl whose arm he had nibbled on earlier has now grown into a gorgeous young Paro (or Parminder, played by Mahi Gill). The childhood fondness has evolved with puberty into a teasing romance bathed in sexual innuendo. And when Paro consents to sending Dev a snapshot of herself naked, he promptly decides to head homeward (Kashyap's naughty lines are priceless in this scene). However, destiny intervenes by way of a gross misunderstanding, shattering the 'happily-ever-after' and giving us a story. In the ensuing misunderstanding, Dev shuns Paro, leading to her taking the rather severe step of getting married to a rich widower. Fraught with guilt, Dev begins to sink to the depths of alcoholic depression, as the frustrated loser begins to take shape. After one particularly violent bout with the bottle, Dev passes out and wakes up to find himself in the squalid interiors of a hotel in Delhi's neon-lit Pahar Ganj area. The third vital character in the plot, Chanda / Chandramukhi (played by Indo- French actress Kalki Koelchin) is introduced here. A former victim of a horrible MMS scandal, she now wears the persona of an in-demand, college-going prostitute who, when she is not bringing men to orgasms over the phone in Tamil, dresses up in a variety of imaginative outfits (ironically, one of them happens to be that of an 'all-American school girl') and engages in kinky role play with mama's boys. Through a delightfully slimy pimp Chunni (a fine performance by Dibyendu Bhattacharya), Dev is introduced to Chanda. In Chanda, Dev finds an outlet for his love for Paro, a comforting listener. Just as things begin to warm, Kashyap's tale veers off in a different direction from the original and... I shan't tell you more. Technically, Kashyap's 'Dev D.' is a visually delectable film against the psychedelic backdrop of sex, drugs and some Desi wedding band fare. Cinematographer Rajeev Ravi does a fine job of capturing the grittiness of Pahargunj  whether it be the grimy squalor of Dev's hotel or Chanda's lair drenched in shocking pink. The play with film speeds works particularly well in the heady drinking scenes as do the 'Requiem for a Dream'-like floating shots of a well-hammered Dev wandering back to his room in a chemical daze. Amit Trivedi's music (a bulky, multi-genre score that moves from folk to jazz to hard rock) is a solid character in itself, as it meanders through scenes, hitting the spot every time.The screaming reception his 'Emosanal Atyachar' got in the cinema hall,is testament that brassy wedding band fare can indeed be made to sound hip. The acting department is damn tight. Mahi Gill's Paro is a thrill to watch  a character perfectly aware of her sexuality and surprisingly expressive for her small-town background. Although Kalki Koelchin may run into rough patches with the accent and diction, her emotional scenes make up for it, especially in the film's second-half, as the relationship between her and Dev begins to evolve. Dibyendu Bhattacharya almost steals the show as Chunni (Kashyap's re-incarnation of the original Chunnilal) but in the end, it is Abhay Deol who takes the cake, champagne and the butter chicken home, playing the coke-snorting loser lover, with measured confidence and understated cool. The gentleman's acting chops are firmly in place and I am not surprised as to why everyone is raving about him. It would be good to see more of Mahi Gill, Kalki Koelchin and Dibyendu in the future.So where lie the pitfalls then? For one, the film's length (a heady three hours) is overwhelming and Kashyap might have just managed to overcome this, had it not been for its extended trajectory that runs into an abrupt wall. Some might even argue that Trivedi's score drenches almost all the scenes in the film. But the pros far outweigh the cons here. For the most past, the film's characters are unabashedly honest and real. Kashyap's script-writing chops give us gems like the 'haldi' scene, the 'ticket' scene where Dev gets reprimanded by an old female co-passenger on the bus, after a particularly nasty alcoholic binge as well as Paro's delightfully ingenious solution to finding a venue for her and Dev to consummate their relationship (and the aftermath). Those of you familiar with the medical sitcom 'Scrubs', will take great pleasure in Kashyap's use of the aforementioned dancing boy trio for moments of random delight. ' Dev D.' is an important film to consume as we sit on the cusp of a more progressive Indian cinema  a sign of good things to come. You may not exactly fall in lust, as the film urges one to, but you will certainly want to discuss it, perhaps even fight over it." 
" Devdas Kashyap-Style","Dev.D, Anurag Kashyap's contemporary take on Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's classic novel Devdas is simply extraordinary. Kashyap's direction is excellent and his interpretation of the original story is a perfect example of how creative and artistic an adaptation of this sort can be. The film is set partly in Punjab and partly in Delhi and captures the atmosphere of both places with precision. Kashyap masterfully portrays the effervescence, colourfulness and rusticity of the rural Punjab areas from one side, and then explores the morbid and dark reality of the urban Delhi. The film is very realistic and aspects which contribute to this include the simple writing, the slick editing and cinematography and the natural acting. It deals with such themes as sexuality, love, drugs, prostitution, self-destruction, and complex relationships. The film's fast-paced narrative style, which includes authentic dialogues, serious proceedings and many many songs (all of which are lovely, modern, and appropriately selected), is very unique and matter-of-fact. Abhay Deol stars as a modern-day Devdas, and he does an excellent job. He shows Dev's confusion, complacence, gradual ruin, and later his self-acceptance and coming to terms, with conviction and depth. Kashyap introduces two young girls in the leading roles. Mahie Gill is the first, and she is first-rate in her debut performance as Paro - very believable and impulsive. Kalki Koechlin is less impressive at first, but grows on you as the story goes by. At some points in the initial portions it looks like she's struggling with her lines, but in the second half, she confidently turns into a charming young lady and ultimately leaves a mark. The film's ending is fantastic and unexpected. To sum it up, Dev.D is Kashyap's gem. It is a prime quintessence of Hindi cinema's capability and coming-of-age. I recommend you to watch it." 
" One of the best film ever made in Bollywood .","This is a technical genius of Indian Cinema. One of the best films ever made. One film I personally can even think of parallel y in terms of quality would be Omkara. Dev D is not a film but a reflection of Indian youth as it is in the new century. If there was something called a psychedelic film this would definitely be the one. The soundtrack itself through out the film creates a unparalleled atmosphere. Blended superbly is the story and the characters. I am not a movie critic but I have seen IMDb top 250 and exhaustively Korean, french , Italian and Brazilian movies. This movie stand apart from the rest. There will never be another Dev D like there will never be another Avatar or Schindler's list. The only reason this film did not get worldwide recognition it deserves because it is an Indian film maybe and there should be more exposure of Indian films.If you are not from India, and you are reading this review, watch this film once. Please make a point of watching it with headphones on or good loudspeakers. Watch it at a time, when you are most relaxed and trust me, you will never forget this film. I can personally guarantee that any Indian worth his taste in films, have not watched this movie less than a couple of times.Enjoy the film. I don't write much review, but I like sharing the happiness i get from watching great films. More so, if i can share it with someone not from my country. Dev D is a reflection of India of the 21st century. A India you may have not seen or thought off. This will change your perception of the country to a large extent and will definitely be one of your favorite movies of all time. Blurays are available with subtitles. But trust me, except for some dialogues, the film will reach you beyond the barriers of language.If you are in your 20s, or early 30s, and if you have not watched Dev D , you cannot say you have watched world cinema.I think Schindler's list should be IMDb's no. 1 film and i think Dev D definitely would deserve a place in that list's top 15 if it was watched by the world at large. So watch the film, you will love it, share it with your friends. After-all that's what watching movies is all about. Enjoy with a drink or whatever makes you feel good. :) Adios.." 
" Its explicit ...","This movie follows story line of the famous novel Devdas by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. Although many movies were made earlier on this story, this one is specially different. This movie looks totally different as opposed to the other movies. A special type of, what people would say, "Modern look" makes this movie different.The main attraction of the movie is its screenplay. The sets (and the locations) help to make screenplay look better.Abhay Deol's acting was awesome and as was the role representation of 'Chanda'. Every aspect of her character is highlighted in such a good manner that in some parts of the movie it looks like she is the lead character in the movie.A bunch of songs in the movie eliminate the necessity of creating background scores separately.On the top of everything, the direction of the movie is so good that predictability tends to zero, realism is maintained, suspense is maintained and all actors made to act to their best.The main thing is EVERYTHING IN THIS MOVIE IS EXPLICIT." 
" A modern take on Devdas","Dev D is a modern take on Sarath Chandra Chattopadhyay's acclaimed novel 'Devdas'. The main characters of the original work are given a totally modern look and outlook and the result is a successful face-lift and not a botched up chop-and-change, as most remakes end up coming out as.The casting seems near perfect with both the heroines, Mahie Gill (playing a Punjabi version of Paro) and Kalki Koechlin (playing a mixed-race controversy-hounded schoolgirl turned high-profile escort) doing full justice to their characters. The movie feels like a cross between 'Devdas' and 'Pretty Woman' but without the tragic end of the former or the sickeningly sweet ending of the latter. The director even manages to sneak in a public service message about the dangers of alcohol abuse without sounding preachy! Movies like Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, Fashion, Dostana and now Dev D are shaking off the last shreds of prudishness that once blanketed Indian movies. Even while earlier movies have been bold, the boldness was often portrayed as a depravity and something to be ashamed of, but that, is a thing of the past. Both Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi and Dev D portray married Indian women having sex with their ex-lovers without suffering any post-coital guilt/shame and that is a sure sign of increased maturity.Abhay Deol's portrayal of a spoiled brat's journey through life, which starts with loss of love, meanders through drug and alcohol abuse and finally culminates in the discovery of true love, is splendid. A thoroughly enjoyable movie."
