" Im not Kidding this is a good Movie","Obviously this is not a big budget movie with Mega stars.But a decent Movie one time watch no need to buy a DVD if u get a chance to watch it on TV go for it.You would not like to watch it because of Celina Jaitley (not a good actress);But Celina Jaitley did a decent acting of being a psycho trying to kill a man who hardly was hit to 'death' and had a small cut and a fractured leg.Farooq Shaikh was good.You will laugh on some scenes of Sid which is good.Direction was OK,Script was copy of Stuck (2007).You will obviously swear sometimes because of dumbness of Sonam Chopra (Celina Jaitley).End was good.One time watch movie.Thank You for reading my Review." 
" Predicament - Laugh or get scared?","The good thing about "Accident On Hill Road" is the direction. Yes and due credit is deserved for Mahesh Nair who manages to hold reigns even though plot is wafer-thin. If he had a good subject material indeed he has potential to pull-off a spectacular feat. If not anything, the least this movie could do is to get this director noticed and hopefully good projects would land into his lap.The downside as already mentioned is the plot. Add to that the oscillation of construction of the screen between comical and pity. Right from the start if it was portrayed as comical the same would have turned into a good popcorn flick catering solely to the teenage multiplex crowd (a la "I Know What You Did Last Summer" or "Scary Movie" series types).It no rocket science to discover that Celina Jaitley is a big downer. And so is Abhimanyu Singh. I was expecting more footage for Manmeet Singh. The saving grace is indeed Farooq Shaikh who convincingly pulls- off "never say die" attitude. Moral of the movie: As you sow, so shall you reap" 
" Scary How Relatable This Film Is","The plot is extremely simple, but it leaves your thoughts and emotions running high.Initially, you can vaguely understand Sonam's drastic actions for not giving the poor many any medical attention.The situation, however, soon spirals out of control and it reaches new lows.Sonam's selfish nature slowly and shamelessly emerges into full bloom. Not only is she prepared to kill her best friend, but she also blackmails her boyfriend - the only person she trusts to help her.At the same time, you can relate to all the people who do not come forward to save the man. They all have some problems with the law and do not want to draw any attention towards themselves. While their bystander effect might seem justified, in reality they're only normal people who committed petty crimes - which is nothing compared to murder!
Definitely worth watching - 8/10" 
" Good movie","One time watch good movie.farooq shaikh always good.Thrill continue till end" 
" Great Movie!","I had a thrilling experience watching AOHR for just 1 and a 1/2 hours.The movie is remarkable, be it a copy of some English movie or not. The story revolves around a spoilt girl-immoral, dishonest, drug addict, alcoholic and smoker,working in an old age home, who knocks down a man one night on her way back home after a nightlife party,and unfortunately he gets wedged between the smashed windscreen of her car.The rest is about what happens when she and her boyfriend try to cover up the situation. The plot is exciting,music is catchy,thrills are good.The film throws light on the dark and filthy side of glamor and beauty. It is really worth a watch .You'll definitely enjoy it."
