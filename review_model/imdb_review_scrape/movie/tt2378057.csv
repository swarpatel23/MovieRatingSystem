" Amazing movie","A movie based on some paranormal activity.Great direction by the debut directors Yash Dave and Allyson Patel.When i saw it for the first time i was sure i would watch again with my friends.Question Mark is not an easy movie. It's not a movie that will ever play at a hundred multiplexes and draw large popcorn eating crowds. But it's a fantastic movie, a sweaty, fever-dream of a movie, and it's wonderful that people are engaging with it. There is simply nothing like it in Hindi cinema - and like it or not, that is one thing I'm sure no one can argue with." 
" Good effort","The movie has made good effort in making an original horror movie through a live action camera style. i am writing this review in year 2018 and since this movie there has been many other live action camera style movies in Bollywood/ Tollywood and yet very few has been able to impress as this one due to its originality of story-line and impressive performances by actors. In fact it can be considered a pioneer for the this particular style of horror movie making in India." 
" Pretty good movie not made for the masses","This movie is pretty damn good! I've been wanting to watch a good Hindi horror movie, and this is perfect. What's funny is that it has no star cast and has been shot off what seems like a pretty decent but cheap camera lens. It says that the movie had a budget of 40 lakhs.. It honestly does not seem like the movie has been made for more than 4 lakhs. Definitely a good movie though.. Reminded me of the Blair Witch Project. Couldn't post in parent's guide, so posting this here: It had one very mild kissing scene (you can't see any faces as the scene is in the dark). A lot of abusive language has been used, especially the f-word. If based on language only, I wouldn't want a child watching the movie. I wouldn't let a child watch the movie anyway because it's pretty scary. And not much has scared me. Ever. Kudos to the girl who plays Simran. Really well done role." 
" Don't waste your time reading reviews. Go watch it first :)","Must watch. Don't scare guys, we all want to feel the fear and this is really going to pop your brains out. Rest if you mess up with some few nights sleep after this please take it as the writer's success; who wrote the story. Bollywood is really improving in many ways. The best thing I would say is the new castings that is coming on the big screen. People are really sick and tired of those same heroes and heroines. Also the camera clarity is okay type which makes the movie look more real and easy to attract attention. Again 1 last thing I would love to mention and its that the budget of the movie is not much that's why we've not seen its advertisements also. Please bollywood if possible display some shows in theatre or malls. You'll definitely nake huge profit from it." 
" Amazing movie for a new professional film makers","This movie as a "Found footage film" is an amazing movie. Watching this movie for first time is seriously going to make you scared like anything. But later you will get used to it. If we talk about this movie's budget, then I must say it's a good movie in a budget of 40 lacs. Knowing the expenses of camera these days for shooting. Good job production team. Plot wise they went good with off course. You guys still need to work out on low light video shooting, which I feel is the great point of disappointment. Another good advantage of this movie is that it really encourages making of "Found footage Film" genre. Also it can be identified from this film that , few such films have been created which gives a slight glimpse of the ghost and still the movie makes you scared like anything."
