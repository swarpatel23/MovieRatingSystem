" Good, interesting and beautifully melancholic","Mann is in my honest opinion one of the best films of 1999. It is at first a very nice, light romance which later turns into a sad and emotional drama. The story is very beautiful and is reminiscent of the 1965 classic 'Arzoo', the music is fantastic, and the acting is very effective. Among the songs, "Khushiyan Aur Gham" is one of my most favourite songs ever. Aamir Khan delivers an excellent performance. Although he is not very convincing as a womaniser, he is very good as a suffering lover. I think the best thing about his acting at that point of time was his simplicity and restraint, and that he never tried to do more than required (as I said, at least until that point of time). Manisha Koirala gives an amazing performance. She is intense, compelling and moving as always and does not at any point try to victimise her character. The film's big tragic twist is a tough moment to see, a moment which makes you realise how unexpected life can be and how important it is to cherish every moment of it. This is a wonderful and touching picture. I highly recommend." 
" Breathtaking performance from aamir Khan","Ithink so aamir Khan was just brilliant in this movie I just loved him Even Manisha was looking gorgeous.In whole worth a watch. Songs were Brillaint and Last Scene of the Movie was the best for Long time in Any Hindi Movie. Cheers for Aamir Khan for this lovely movie" 
" A Poetry in Motion","The best movie in the last 2 decades. Aamir Khan outdid himself in every scene. Manisha Koirala was very beautiful and her pain is evident throughout the movie. Definitely the best movie she has acted in. Sharmila Tagore as Dev's grandmother was heart wrenching. Anil Kapoor as usual was good. Above all the Director and his treatment of the movie was mesmerizing. The songs are melodious and meaningful. I have seen this movie at least 6 times and every time I enjoyed it even more than before. I would suggest to the viewers they must see this movie at least a couple times to really appreciate the movie. In all I would say it is a poetry in motion." 
" Best Movie of 1999","I watched Mann a few days after it was released. Manisha Koirala and Aamir Khan are at the peak of their performance. Though it is a remake of a film 'All about an Affair' but the director's work is commendable.I'd want Manisha to be nominated for the best actress award for this movie. The soundtrack is excellent. 'Tinak Tin tana', 'Mera mann', 'Kehna' are the numbers with extremely catching tunes. I'd recommend this movie to all the indian movie lovers." 
" Amazing Movie","First of all this movie is an copy of "An Affair to Remember". But it's a great remake - especially since it's an Indian movie. The musical numbers are really nice. At least one of those which was copied from an Italian song (Toto Cutungo) - I actually found this out after listening to it in a cab in Paris! Perhaps other songs were copied as well.However, all the elements, even if they were copied, fit together wonderfully. Perhaps they fit together even better because they combined so many extraordinary elements (the story line of an American classic & Italian song and of course the emotions captured in Indian movies).Personally, this movie really touched me more than any other. The movie starts off very simply and suddenly brings out the emotions come out strong.Note: the copied song I was referring to was "Nasha Yeh Pyar Kya"" 
" My Favorite movie","Mann movie is one of my favorite movies. Mann's story based on love. its story is heart touching story. specially its songs is very beautiful. Aamir khan acting is very good. in this story Amir khan playing a corrector who love every girl for time pass. after that a girl coming in his life Manisha. She meet him in a ship. Amir khan try to flirt her. in the end of ship tour he loves Manisha truly. After that they promise to each other that they will meet after six months.After six months boy come to meet place but girl not come. the boy hurt very much. after that he become a famous painter. in the end of story he meet her. he open up that girl lost her legs in a accident after Listen her story he marriage to that girl because he loves her very much. its song and story is very good." 
" A Terrific Love Story","Mann is a very intense romantic drama with a brilliant music. The acting by Aamir Khan and Manisha Koirala was more than excellent. No two ways about that.Aamir Khan is the best actor in Bollywood and he has proved that he is the most versatile with a unique change in his characters. He has always been consistent throughout his career and that is why that he is reigning Indian cinema from the past decade.Manisha Koirala has a great potential to do emotional scenes and in Mann she also conducted light comedy scenes flawlessly.Mann revolves around Dev Karan Singh (Aamir Khan) and Priya (Manisha) showing different twists in their long run for true love and an unexpected climax which is worth watching. The first half was enjoyable with a flare of comedy and the second half had a fair share of emotions which would keep your heart flowing with Dev and Priya till the last scene(and what a scene it was) !!The  music by debutant duo Sanjeev-Darshan is one of the main highlights of Mann. They brought out some very interesting tunes which occupies your mind and it is worth of them to be listened repeatedly. All songs are infectious and melodious which are delivered by Udit, Alka and Hema Serdasai - All at their best. The locales and photography was also beautiful captured.Overall Mann is a fascinating movie with romance and emotions at their height. What more ..... Listen To Your Heart." 
" A film like many others","I don't have a lot to say on the matter of this film except that while this is a good film, it is the same story of "An Affair to Remember" with Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant. However, I hear that "An Affair to Remember" is just the movie "Love Affair" with Irene Dunne. So, what can you do, right? Anyway, it is an excellent film. It has Aamir Khan, so that's an "uber" bonus; he can definitely send your heart a flutter in a very Cary-Grant-ish way. If you're wondering, there is a reason humanity as found the need to continue retelling this tale; it is both tragic and lovely at the same time. So whether you are watching Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant, Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer, or Aamir Khan and Manisha Koirala (may I suggest all three couples), you are guaranteed to see phenomenal acting and a heartfelt tale." 
" For sir amair and for priya ma'am","By your this movie 'MANN' you learn me to do love from one and from our heart . Thanks sir and ma' am for that. Thank god bless to you dear sir and ma'am." 
" Remake of Love Affair 1994 AND 1957 An Affair to remember","Aamir Khan and Manisha have made two remakes of English movies. Akele Hum Akele Tum (1995) = Kramer Vs Kramer (1979) ; Mann (1999) = Love Affair (1994) and 'An Affair to Remember (1957). Last scene is very touchy and ditto copy of Love Affair in Mann. The theme is same in both movies where they promise to meet near a tower after six months to express their love. The girl gets into accident and loses her legs in both movies and tries to avoid meeting her lover. Aamir and Manisha have done a very good job of emotional acting in both movies. However, Mann has some songs which are needed in all Hindi Movies. The last scene is worth seeing again and again where the lover finds out about her losing the legs."
