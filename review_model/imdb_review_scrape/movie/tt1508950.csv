" A film that proves gangsters can't shoot straight!!!!","oh dear, oh dear...where to begin.... i read previews about this being a new 'Satya', a gore-filled gangster movie, gritty and exciting.... Well, its definitely not any of these. A relative of mine even watched the film and warned me about how bad it was, but did that stop me from watching this pile of dog poo? I've never seen so many gunfights in a movie were the shooters keep missing the targets, maybe except Commamndo and Rambo, but they don't claim to be 'realistic', like this rubbish does. One major scene (Spoiler) has a villain pointing a gun at Baabarr's head because he is supposed to kill him, he fires it...scene cuts.... the next scene Baabarr in hospital with a bandage around his head!! Talk about missing from point-blank range!! What was he firing anyway... a potato gun!!! Bad story, Bad acting, Bad dialogue, maybe the only saving grace a 'mildy' gory fight scene in an abattoir..... Mithun, what was you thinking of when you signed up for this movie....? Maybe you thought it was a sequel to Satya. My verdict...Skip this, watch Satya again..." 
" A brilliant start ruined by a jaded script.",""Baabarr" releasing without any pre release hype or heavy promotions, comes out to be a marginally decent watch in parts. Looking at the promos of this unknown movie, you find three known names featuring in it as Mithun Chakraborty, Om Puri and Sushant Singh. And refreshingly all three deliver worth watching performances, taking the movie to a much better level than expected.But annoyingly, "Baabarr" keeps on moving between two ends of quality and mediocrity constantly during its two hours of duration. At one end, it offers few sequences which are immensely impressive and well handled by the director Ashu Trikha, whereas on the other, it also has scenes which simply force you to just go for a break.The movie is highly violent and brutal showing a lot of bloodshed with numerous murders and shoot outs. Though it has some gripping moments and power packed performances in store, but sadly talks about the same gang war drama seen several times before on the screen. The script has nothing new to offer as it revolves around the rotten plot of a young boy growing in the surroundings of crime and becoming a big gangster in his youth, only to get killed by the police in a fake encounter. But it's the direction, action and cinematography in the movie which keeps on impressing the viewer at regular intervals of time throughout. Especially the original outdoor locations and the racy chase sequences shot beautifully by the DOP.The initial 20 minutes of the film, depicting the transformation of a young boy into a big gangster are undoubtedly the best moments of this intense crime drama. As you watch the first murder committed by the young "Baabarr", you feel like it's going to be a great explosive watch (as if an Indian "City of God"). However the director fails to maintain the electrifying pace generated by its superb opening, resulting in just an average product later on. In few words, "Baabarr" starts from a higher level and then slides down to the same old path, reducing the overall impact of the movie to a great extent.The best performance comes once again from the veteran actor, Om Puri, who skillfully delivers a polished act of a corrupt police officer with conviction. Mithun Da shines bright in the role of an encounter specialist SP. Sushant Singh as Baabarr's rival gangster is superb in his few scenes. The debutant Sohum Shah playing Baabarr, tries hard and puts all his efforts to do full justice to his role but doesn't have the killer looks of "Bhiku Mhatrey" in his eyes. The passion and aggression seen in Manoj Bajpai's act is completely missing here. Tinnu Anand, Shakti Kapoor and Mukesh Tiwari excel in their brief parts. Urvashi Sharma also does much better than her previous projects. Musically, out of the two songs incorporated in the script, I think the Qawwali track should have been used more, as it sounded quite catchy and lyrical in its brief version.Summing up, where director Ashu Trikha had everything in place for his big project, yet I couldn't understand why he chose such a jaded subject for his movie. He ineffectively tries to cover up the poorly written script with his competent direction, but fails to emerge as a winner because the viewer has already seen everything shown in the movie in far superior products such as "Satya", "Company" and more. So, I wish him all the luck for his next project. As far as his "Baabarr" is concerned, it may fetch better results in the smaller centers and single screen theaters out of the metros." 
" I was impressed, better than I expected.","A movie which know one has heard of came as a surprise to me. Ashu Trika's movies never have been highly anticipated. Right through from 'Deewanapan' to 'Alag' his features had came and went unnoticed. They never made the bells ring at the box office either. 'Baabar' is altogether a different experience. Since I am very familiar with the underworld and gangster genre, to me it was just another bad guy movie. It preaches the same message that we have heard time and time again 'those who live by the gun, die by the gun' and ' crime never pays'. I was again subjected to the same routine police shoot ups, plot and regular goings on as depicted in previous seen movies. However the second half proved to be surprisingly enjoyable, as the movie progresses with a plot. There is more focus on the police authorities as well as the the main gangster character. This bared a slight resemblance to a earlier 2005 movie called 'sehar' Unfortunately this movie did not fall in to the same high league. However it does raise a eye brow. Maye if Sanjay Gupta directed it he would get some recognition as a director. ************************SPOILERS AHEAD************************* Amanganj in U.P is the backdrop in the move. A boy 'baabar' enters in to the world of crime by killing someone. A few years pass and and he is one the most feared gangsters in the area. He has had countless cases against him ranging from extortion to kidnapping and murder. Tinnu Anand plays the senior who he works for and Mukesh Tiwari is his accomplice. Mithun enter the area as the s.p cop who had been transfered and has vowed to bring baabar to justice dead or alive. Meanwhile baabar has old scores to settle with his rival enemy 'sushant singh' after he looses a contract to him. Later Mithun makes a plan to capture Baabar while catching Om Puri as being the cop on the take. Om later has no choice but to assist Mithon in catching Baabar by using suppression and torture tactics. It proves difficult as baabar's accomplices are not willing to give his whereabouts that easily. Urvashi Sharma (his girlfriend) is however used eventually to get to Baabar. After his arrest corrupt politicians are afraid that he may leak out their secrets. So following Om's plan they decide to have him killed in transit journey. However there are other plans that are made to make it look different.***************END OF SPOILERS***************The movie has a good pace and there is never a dull moment. All the songs have been interwoven in to the scenes. Ashu's direction is not up to the standard that is required. Jiggering camera work does not leave an impact. Due to the low production cost the film at times feels like a b grade flick. However there are a few plus points, instead of chronicaling the life of a gangster, much attention is on the police force and the method and tactics they use to bring baabar to justice. This is the highlight of the script. Newcomer Soham Shah gave a decent performance and has much potential. Sushant is good as always and appears in the same roles. Mithon is brilliant and mesmerises us again. Urvashi did not impress considering this was her second or third movie. Special mention has to be given to Om Puri who is the heart of the movie. His role is interesting and brings the movie forward at every level as well as influencing it. Both 'shakti Kapoor and Govind Namdev were wasted in roles which lasted 5 to 10 mins. There involvement was very minimum. The background score is pathetic and did not add to the experience. The sudden twist in the ending came as a surprise. I could not help commenting on the scenes of police brutality that were shown. When will Indian cinema give a positive image of the law enforcements ?. It is getting too much." 
" Underrated !! Must Watch","I doubt if this film was a hit at the box office but I was eager to watch this film ever since I saw the trailer . There is some superb acting in this movie , good songs . I liked the dialogues and plot of the film as well.The lead actor Sohum Shah has acted impressively well for a debut film . Tinu Anand and Om Puri have shown their experience in this film with mature acting.The Villain Sushant Singh (Tabrez) has also done a great job and the role given to him was a perfect match for his personality.If you have missed the film and you hate the typical bollywood romance crap , this movie is a must watch for all crime genre fans out there." 
" Masterfull..... A Fantastic Film!","Ashu Trikha has made fantastic cinema in 'Baabarr', a brilliant film.An outstanding effort, a film that talks about crime. It says, Crime Never Dies, It Only Chances Faces...Yes, 'Baabarr' is gory & abusive, but that's works in it's favor. This film promises to be hard-hitting, and it lives up-to the mark completely.Right from the beginning when a teenager takes us to the world of these corrupt, evil people, your sucked into this violent world. Plus the culmination takes you by surprise... it leaves you awe-struck.Direction wise, Ashu Trikha does a brilliant job. He delivers one of the most powerful films of recent time. Dialogue are brilliant as well, so is the Cinematography. Music by Anand Raaj Anand is good.Performance-Wise: Mithun is fantastic. The style this man has is untouchable. Om Puri is first-rate as the corrupt cop. Soham as Baabarr, is very good. Playing a complex/conniving character with great understanding. He's here to stay. Sushant Singh is competent. Tinnu Anand is excellent; especially in his death scene. Mukesh Tiwari impresses, yet again. Shakti Kapoor is effective in a brief role. Urvashi Sharma looks pretty and delivers a fine performance. Govind Namdeo, Vishwajeet Prdhan & Pratima Kazmi, are good.On the whole 'Baabarr' is a powerful film. Violence can be ignored, watch this masterstroke." 
" Crime never dies, it only changes faces!!","Well honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this movie when I started watching it. But things got better and I was actually impressed by the end of it.Om Puri, Mithun and Sushant Singh have done full justice to their roles (as usual).The newcomer Soham has given his best and would've pulled it off if it wasn't for his weak dialogue delivery.There are some real good scenes, my personal favourite being the fight sequence in the meat shack.The movie has been brilliantly done considering the fact that the writers haven't cooked up anything. (yes, its all true) All in all, a complete wrap up and very well done (no loose ends)." 
" Ridiculous Attempt to show Muslims as the Bad Guys","Just a ridiculous attempt to flag Muslims as the bad guys. I mean the writer tries to show that Muslims reek havoc everywhere, the story is all crap. The heroin of the movie has sex with the villain, means the movie shows women as whores. What the hell? It's a copy of Once upon a time in Mumbai, that movie was 10 times better and original. oh dear, oh dear...where to begin.... i read previews about this being a new 'Satya', a gore-filled gangster movie, gritty and exciting.... Well, its definitely not any of these. A relative of mine even watched the film and warned me about how bad it was, but did that stop me from watching this pile of dog poo? I've never seen so many gunfights in a movie were the shooters keep missing the targets, maybe except Commando and Rambo, but they don't claim to be 'realistic', like this rubbish does." 
" good screenplay with bad Acting","I dint have anything to watch until i found this movie in my database and checked the review and started watching it....Started very well and i was glued to it, after 25 minutes into the movie i realized that it isn't anything out of the regular chain of BHAI movies as we knight it..The story is nothing new but this would have been a great-to-watch if only the direction would have been better rather...only good...!! Apart from Tinu Anand (who gave us a part of Agneepath) no one else acted...it was filming all the way...specially the lead character...he needs to go to some good acting school.. OVERALL...a good movie with a bad Direction and acting...skip it for once and you wont regret it..!!!"
