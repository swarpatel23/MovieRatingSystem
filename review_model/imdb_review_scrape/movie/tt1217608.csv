" Finally YMZ see's daylight","I had been searching high and low for this film and it was finally in front of me downloaded on my PC.....well it was nice to see aby's and shatrugan appearance changing from scene to scene (as the makers used original footage from 70's and some from the 90's) and i don't think aby did the shooting for the climax shooting as all his shots were either from a distance or from an angle. As all reels weren't used some scenes didn't make sense, but you cant be asking for too much, a film like this was a no hope, and its major achievement that it finally saw daylight,it was funny to see abys geeky 70's hairstyle in one scene and dan seeing his 90's hairstyle in the next scene. was pleasure seeing Iftekar, i quite loved his acting. Aruna Irani was only in 2 scenes as ranjeet's rape victim. i would rate this 5/10 just for the aby shatru team after many years.I think this will be the only review on this movie on the whole wide web......but if there others seen dis dan please do share your views" 
" Finally released","The film was started in 1970s and completed in 1993 with a different director and finally released in 2008. The film is very confusing actually, it has a plot which is done to death but due to the delay and jerky shooting with shifts from 70s to 90s scenes it gets annoying and confusing.The film has shades of Namak Haraam(1973) perhaps this wouldve released before or after. Half of the footage is used from 70s while some is shot in 90s and perhaps Shatru shot more in the 90s portions while Amitabh's scenes are confined to 70s only, In the end A body double is used to pass off as Amitabh Direction by Ashok Gupta, earlier by Mukul Dutt is okay Music is okayAmitabh gets hardly scope and is okay,his dubbing in between is done by someone else, Shatrughan Sinha whose looks keep changing between 70s to 90s is as usual, Amongst rest Sudha Chandran in her younger days is fine, rest including Iftekar who is not shown towards the end perhaps he passed away before the film was completed."
