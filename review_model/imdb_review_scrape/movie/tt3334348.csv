" Heartless leaves you Speechless....8.5/10","HEARTLESS...a complete package..a much awaited movie after a long time which u can share with your friends,love and much more..with your FAMILY. The movie starts with some luring background score...the sound of blowing instruments and the violins are exceptional.And before the release we have witnessed people humming....Mai Dhoondne Ko Jamane Me,Mashooqana,Soniye..and other heartless songs..which makes it a HIT as per Musical aspects. Adhyayan has proved himself again with good acting skills,nice expressions and scary pain in the operation theater. He had improved his class in dancing.Ariana Ayam is good,she looked nice and pretty.The movie deals with the love and romance of this new couple on the first half and suddenly it becomes a thrilling experience in the OT where it displays the love of a Mother for her son after the interval. We can see the class of acting in the performances of Deepti Naval,Om Puri and the young looking Shekhar Suman.Madan Jain also impresses in his short role. As a whole it's a good movie to watch...and we should give a high five to the Director Mr. Shekhar Suman who chooses this uncommon rare topic instead of making any spicy common fighting sequence type movie with sexy item numbers in it.FINAL VERDICT : 8.5/10(STARS)IF YOU HAVE ANY DIFFERENCES WITH YOUR MOM...THEN WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH HER....TRUST ME ...YOU Don't HAVE TO SAY A WORD TO SETTLE ANYTHING ...HEARTLESS ADHYAYAN WILL DO THIS FOR YOU." 
" It would be Heartless to write this off completely.","Heartless, a directorial debut by Shekhar Suman. I heard Shekhar Suman sharing in one of the TV show during movie promotions that this movie is literally and figuratively heartless. True upto an extent. Shekhar Suman indeed dons the hat of a director in a very good manner. Though, I need to admit that this movie has its own share of flaws and fine points. The first half of the movie is not built up logically and the characters are not defined nicely. I kept on wondering at the fast-motion love which blossomed between the lead pair Adhyayan Suman as Aditya Singh / Addi and Ariyana Ayam as Ria and tried to figure out what actually clicked between them. Why Aditya seemed to be unsure of himself, insecure in life, rebellious at times in spite of his businesswoman mother Ms. Gayatri Singh (played by Deepti Naval) showering him with her love, care, concernit is not justified properly. The first half gives a feeling that it is going to be the struggle of Aditya to cope up with a deadly heart disease, rather win over the disease with the support of Ria's love. But, when the movie began, the noting said that it focuses on Anesthesia Awareness (a scary situation wherein a patient seemingly unconscious to the doctors is able to hear sounds and experience pain). So, my thoughts moved to the direction that probably, it could be a case of medical negligence. Could it be a love story or be a Medical Thriller?But the plot changes its track in the second half which kept me glued to the screen better than the first half ...the story begins here. With unpredictable and shocking twists, suspense is built up, still I wish the subject could have been dealt more clearly (though it is heartless on my part to say so). Adhyayan looks good on screen, especially during the song sequences. Ariyana delivered an average performance, though looks pretty on screen. Shekhar Suman as Cardiologist Samar Saxena is effortless in his performance. But the non-clarity (at times) of the script gets translated to his certain scenes as well. Deepti Naval is great as Aditya's mother, whose head-strong shrewd personality is shown on one side and on the other hand, a doting mother who lived for her son. Om Puri as Dr. Trehaan's role is minimal yet pivotal to the movie. Thumbs up for the exceedingly well shot scenes (especially Dubai) by Cinematographer Derrick Fong, a few nice songs (though out of place at times), a heart-touching emotional mother-son scene towards the end, no melodrama overpowering the characters and above all a welcome break from the regular story" 
" a decent adaptation and a must watch for a change","whats good- 1.story,it is something that's never seen before in bollywood....2.direction, as a 1st time director Shekhar Suman has done a very good job....3.acting,supporting cast outdone the lead but as a lead actor Adhyayan Suman is good but actress is average....4.music,all together isn't great but compared to the type of music that are currently rolling in bollywood its pretty good with a couple of very nice songs.what's not that great- well i haven't found any major flaw in the movie but yes the 1st half of the movie is slow and filled with regular romance sequels..final words- this movie is based on concept never seen before in any bollywood movie and it has been adapted with a lot of emotion. despite some flaws i recommend this movie to everyone. A must watch with your family....." 
" The movie a copy material!!","Well a much awaited movie finally released last Friday.. The success was much to be seen by the hit music of the movie which actually makes the movie a music hit.. The music was great and the acting of Adhyayan suman was a great work but the all the things came to an end when we were able to make out that the movie is a Bollywood remake of Hollywood movie awake... The movie started with a sweet node of narration and i could see the multiplex audience humming main dhoondh ne ko zamane main, i think that thing said it all about the great music of the movie... but All the things remained silent when the audience were able to make out the copy material.. Well i think overall the movie was a packed entertainment but the story line somehow down-sighted the movie..." 
" Awaful in short watch Awake instead","100% ripoff of Awake and a very bad one staring Hayden Christensen and Jessica Alba. Watch it only if you cant sleep on one of those nights and this sure will make you sleep. S Suman cant Direct.Songs were so so. Acting was very bad except from the Hero's mother. Om Puri was wasted. First half is very bad and the second half just as bad. Some of the actors just seem to be going through the motions as they know how bad this is not their fault just that the screenplay was too weak. A Suman tries hard but his dad just cant direct and make this work.Watch Awake http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211933/combined instead nothing much to say about this one."

" Heartless","Hate to say this,but this movie is true to it's name. It is indeed, heartless. A story that has potential but ends up being lost in an initial song and dance routine. It then raises hopes of being a revenge saga, which it fails to be. It gives a lot of due to a mother whose love is immeasurable, a due it deserves; but fails to do justice to the rest of the plot. It's nice that the hero has an all forgiving attitude in the end, but nothing justifies wrapping this up within a time frame of five minutes! The anesthesia bit is pretty stretched out, and needed more editing. Performance wise, I will avoid talking about the debutante heroine. Deepti Naval's performance is soul stirring, like it always is. Kudos to her efforts in this weak tale. Adhyayan is bad, to put it honestly. He fails to emote for the most part. Surprisingly, Shekhar Suman, who makes a very unnecessary cameo looks like a robot here. Certainly not expected of him. Om Puri does his best in the little bit he gets. Music is run off the mill. I called the movie heartless because though the hero does manage to understand his mother's supreme love after what seems like ages, he seems superhumanly capable of suppressing his emotions towards the woman responsible for taking away his mother. Is this a failing on part of the actor, character or narration? I believe all of it! This movie would be better if it had exchanged it's endless beginning with the miniscule climax. When I hear of films with unusual plots, it really gets me excited to give them a shot. But this one is a big let down." 
" An emotional but weak attempt to adapt a fine English thriller.","Expressing on a personal note, I can emotionally relate to the big unexpected loss experienced by director Shekhar Suman's family a few years back and have my due respect for everyone who wished to convey a positive message through this film straight from their hearts. Hence if considered from the social awareness angle, HEARTLESS rightly talks about a case of medical conspiracy pointing towards the compromising state of this divine profession felt by many in the last few decades. But unfortunately all the positivity around its core theme gets lost when Shekhar Suman tries to give the message in a very conflicting, unethical and confused manner which simply falls flat without making much impact on the viewers due to its below average execution. Now revealing the three major drawbacks in this well intentioned attempt: Firstly since there is no information of the film being an official remake so I am forced to call it a blatant copy of the English Flick AWAKE (2007) featuring Hayden Christensen and Jessica Alba in the lead. The film is entirely based on this borrowed script focusing on a mysterious medical phenomenon called "Anesthetic Awareness"in which the person lying on the operation table can hear voices and feel the pain too but cannot move his body or wake up, being in a kind of paralyzed form. So putting it bluntly if Shekhar was really willing to make a film with a strong social message talking about medical ethics then at least the remake should have been made following the ethical procedure too buying the official rights. (However if Shekhar Suman did take the rights and didn't announce it in the media or mentioned it in the titles (or I somehow missed it) then this first point stands irrelevant.)Secondly if you are making a medical thriller (as I would like to call it), then it has to be made as a fast moving crime thriller only without wasting much time in the buildup. But since the director also wanted the film to be an emotional love story targeting the youngsters too, so he becomes confused and fills the entire first half with the same routine love scenes, 4 songs and a family drama saying nothing about the real subject of "Anesthetic Awareness" at all. As a result, the film actually begins in the second half only and one can straight away watch it post the interval without losing much of its basic storyline or any major scenes. Moreover, in editing terms the whole 70-75 minutes of its first half with many unwanted sequences and songs could easily be compiled into 20-25 minutes and that too with 1 or 2 forcibly inserted songs shot abroad (Dubai).Thirdly, since it was a re-launch film for Shekhar's son Adhyayan, so to keep the complete focus on him alone, a new girl was introduced in the lead along with veterans as Deepti Naval, Om Puri and Shekhar Suman himself. But actually the complex subject demanded more intense portrayal on the screen by the lead pair which becomes another factor responsible for its poor result. Adhyayan tries hard but he still needs to improve a lot in his various skills and Ariana also has to work on her Hindi diction first to get some more projects. Also in the supporting cast, at one end we have an impressive act coming from Deepti Naval playing the mother but on the other Shekhar Suman visibly tries to underplay his role intentionally and Om Puri looks totally unconvincing in his silly 'Doctor in Love' act doing the last minute operation.Therefore despite having a novel, interesting and engaging plot for most of the viewers (who may not have seen the original English Flick AWAKE), HEARTLESS fails miserably since it has been made following a puzzled vision of catering all sorts of target audience together along with launching Adhyayan once again as the solo hero. Adding further, the mediocre outcome was inevitable & it will always turn out to be the same whenever any Hindi film-maker will try to adapt a mere '85 minute tight English thriller' into a 130+ minutes stretched Hindi version unnecessarily without any clear vision.As per the direction, HEARTLESS does have few moving emotional sequences between the mother and son, but also has many amateurish kind of scenes too in the first half ruining the initial impact completely. Plus later all the hospital or operation theater sequences are shot quite carelessly without following the basic rules & regulations of a big hospital in a hilarious or rather ridiculous mode. Interestingly AWAKE was also criticized a lot on the similar medical grounds but still at least they shot those sequences in a much convincing style without any doubt. The DOP tries his best to make a noticeable impression along with the CGI department (particularly in the title song) and the disturbing operation visuals might be upsetting for many clearly showing the open body parts like never before. The soundtrack is soothing to hear while one is watching the film but nothing stays with you after its over and the background score fails to generate any exciting tension in its final hour.On the whole, had Shekhar adapted the original thriller as it is without much adulteration, he would have got a different story to tell at the box office or at least a decent film for the viewers in all possibilities. Nevertheless in the present version HEARTLESS is sure going to find it hard both at the box office as well as on the home video front too due to the obvious reasons. And in case you are very much interested in knowing about the subject of "Anesthetic Awareness", then go for the original AWAKE instead and save some time."
