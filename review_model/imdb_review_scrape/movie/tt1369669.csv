" Blast From The Past!!","Puneet Sira's 'Jai Veeru' is a outdated flick, but honesty, it works for me it works. When I say it works for me, I mean it works on me relaxing my brain when I watch a film like this. The film is a cut-out 80's Hindi film, 6 songs, comedy, action and emotional melodrama. 'Jai Veeru' is escapist cinema to the hilt, but it comes as a relief for me, I didn't even think or ask myself a question while watching the film, as I didn't take it too seriously. 'Jai Veeru' is no way a good film, but isn't the worst film either.Performances: Fardeen Khan is decent. Kunal Khemu is enjoyable, he's in from. He's spontaneous in comic scenes, stylish in songs, and very natural in emotional scenes. He has the energy to sustain in Hindi films. Dia Mirza's character is predictable, and that's the biggest flaw in her character. As far as her performance is concerned, Dia is as usual. Anjana Sukhani is functional. Arbaaz Khan is passable as the menace. Govind Namdeo is good.on the whole 'Jai Veeru' reminds you of films that were made in the 80's, watch it if you were a hardcore fan of the films that were made in the decade gone by." 
" Total wastage of money and time","'Jai Veeru: Friends Forever' is a clear wastage of time & most importantly money. There is no wonder that this film is a total disaster. Well, first of all---- 1. This movie has practically no story; it is really hard to say that why the producers had invested their money at this non sense project.2. All the actors did a pretty horrible job; especially Kunal Khemu was terrible while Fardeen khan was intolerable; all the other actors sank with this unthinkable script.3. This film scored a total zero from the direction to acting, script, music, dialogue, and practically at everything. One should not try to waste his or her precious time or money by watching this crap." 
" I demand for change in the movie title!","Going by the narrative the movie has a striking resemblance to the 1980's. The Fardeen-Kunal chemistry is an attempt to recreate 48 Hours/ Lethal Weapon/ Rush Hour. And in all honesty, good writing could have made it possible.Anyways, Fardeen is confident and Kunal should stick to these kind of "Circuit" roles for he fits into them like hand-in-glove.Anjana Sukhani:: Miss-Goody-Two-Shoes wasn't required in this movie. Dia Mirza:: Except for the two-minute essential role in the finale, this girl also could have been bumped.Arbaaz Khan:: What a waste!! No characterisation at all.Songs are quite hummable even though a few of them drop in at frequent intervals.Puneet Sira showed lots of promise in "I - Proud To Be Indian" but he stinks in "Jai Veeru".The very least the movie could have done is to have avoided the obvious reference to the immortal bond of friendship." 
" Worth A While!","I watched this movie couple of days ago i personally thought it wasn't that bad compared to some latest ones out. It's got some funny scenes now and then, I think all the actors acted well some of the songs are good worth a while watch it wont be disappointed. The movie is about inseparable pals, Jai (Fardeen Khan) and Veeru (Kunal Khemu) who find themselves on opposite sides of the law, each feeling betrayed by the other. In fact, the only person who hates them more then they hate each other is a ruthless gangster Tejpal (Arbaaz Khan), who wants to kill both of them and put them six feet under! Now, through a strange twist of fate, Jai and Veeru are to run.together! With a little luck, the boys might just get out of this one alive .if they don't kill each other first! Will they survive? Will their friendship Survive?" 
" Just another bad ripoff of a Hollywood production","This is just another bad Hollywood ripoff.This is a copy of the Adam Sandler/Damon Wayans Hollywood movie Bulletproof.First of all Bulletproof was not a great movie! But that doesn't mean the Bollywood version has to be bad. In this case it is bad, it is supposed to be a action/comedy I think. There is no good action and no comedy in this movie! I think this is can be credited to the casting. Fardeen Khan is not an action hero an Kunal Khemu is not a funny guy.Maybe this movie would be nice if it had actors for JAI: Abhishek Bachchan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar. VEERU: Ritish Deshmukh, Shreyas Talpade, Saif Ali Khan, Vivek Oberoi."
