" Indian Science Fiction Cannot get any better!!!","It was the most entertaining science-fiction film I saw, since "Source Code". I have seen numerous recently released, Indian and Hollywood Films of the genre and all of them failed miserably.With the limited budget, the final product which comes before us is praise-worthy.The best point about the movie is that the film attempts to propound a new concept in Indian film-making and in this attempt, it fairly succeeds. The movie has its heart-gripping moments with a great plot. Hussain has done a great job as the male lead and that woman we see in "Horlicks" advertisement, has done a good job too.But, before you watch this movie,I will recommend you to keep following things in mind:First, it is the first directorial venture of the director, don't expect it to be par excellence and yet the director has done a commendable job in tackling the script.Second, the songs were unnecessary and thankfully, all of them were lasted less than a couple of minutes.The budget of the songs should have been utilized in the publicity. Please ignore them.Third, the script has one or two loopholes. But it is not detrimental to the overall plot of the film.We are the common folks and we are forced to watch garbage in the name of entertainment by the so-called big-banners of the industry. Watching this movie, you will most certainly agree that even the rookies deserve a chance. Go and give this movie a shot. I bet, you will not be disappointed!!" 
" Nice try within the limit.","Maza agaya this movie is good to watch lacks a bit of pace and story dip in the end a bit but over all a good sci fi movie story is good acting is OK .But overall screenplay is nice that you wont leave a place when you watch this movie you will complete .This movie is actually about the time traveling but the concept and how it is use is unique and new so go for it....Don't expect this as it is Hollywood movie this is unique time traveling movie of bollywood style. which you can watch with your family.One of those movie in which director try to come out of the box and give a gem of a movie." 
" Nice concept nice effort.","Watch this movie for its concept only otherwise everything else is just average whether the acting,music,screenplay or anything else. Hussain was good but what more to expect from a Television star! Shree is solely based on time-travel which is a rare concept when you talk about it in the Indian film industry. It could have been better as it lacks that "bollywood spice" (humor,satire,good music etc.). On the whole its a one time watch if you take interest in watching it and not act like a pessimist. I respect the makers for their brave effort but risk is often not a choice. Not much films are made on the sci-fi genre and very few enjoy commercial success. My ratings would be a 6 out of 10." 
" An Excellent movie. Must watch for all","It is heartening to see such thrillers especially made in sub continent. Shree is a wonderful movie in which a brilliant concept of time traveling has been shown. Though a number of movies has been made on this concept, Shree has depicted a new dimension to it. Hussain is very good along with other cast members. Director of the movie is debutant and his movie shows his dedication and hard work. I do not know whether the movie is conceived from Hollywood movie or some novel, Idea is out of box and acting of whole cast is awesome. The film is much better than the typical movies and requires attention of youth. After Vicky Donor, a very different and stylish film has been presented for audience of whole sub continent. I suggest all to view this movie." 
" Nice Concept Encapsulated In Shoddy Filmmaking!","Time Travel, a subject only dared by foreign filmmakers has been taken by a bunch of newbies & I must say they have tried hard to create SHREE.With a plot very predictable since beginning, Shree starts with a rags- to-riches kinda story-line expressing greed for free money & professional promotion. The plot revolves around the thrilling episodes which take place as the people who are behind this little experiment turn suspicious. Hussain acts well enough in his debut; supporting cast is average with most of them needing extra meditation.Music is brilliant, but they are placed poorly - mostly during crucial conversations, & are repetitive. Cinematography is bad, so is the production set. With absolutely no budget, Shree mostly emphasizes on the producers' brand name which happens to be "Ciemme." Every bus stop, bill board, shoppes have their banners dangling. Why not make an ad instead?Although the filmmaking factors are very poor, the thriller actually builds a suspense which lasts till the interval. Second half is little boring as we can expect everything which will be following. Plus, the climax made me think & confuse a lot. With many goofs & flaws surrounding the non-linear plot (time fissures, etc.) Shree mimics every other mind game movie where attributes like backstabbing & money & fame play a big role.SFX is appreciable but the whole crew needs to have some more practicing to do & polishing their talents.BOTTOM LINE: Don't expect much from it as a cinema. As a thriller, Shree endures... halfway.MESSAGE: Have no greed for free money; do not get fooled by offers which make high promises.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: No | Sex, Nudity, Mouth-Kiss: No | Violence: Mediocre | Gore: Strong | Alcohol, Smoking: No | Drugs: Very Mild" 
" Wondering whether or not, there will be a worthy Bollywood sci-fi film that will be great to watch then this is the one you should be going for...","this one will stump you if you are looking for some great and no nonsensical sci-fi film and it will even shock you more if you know that this one comes from Bollywood, a land of just making films that bear no resemblance of real life or whatever they show.I'm talking about this film that stars a well known and craft actor Hussain Kuwajerwala in his filmy debut. The story of this film is about an accountant and his journey between time that happens because of an offer that is kept in front of him by his seniors and some important people of Mumbai. And how some of out of them decides to misuse the skills of this man named Shree which we as a watcher comes to know who is the unfaithful here.At last, i can just convince you with all of my heart and words that this one doesn't go through the conventional route of how Bollywood films go but through a way a normal story goes. Since it is a Bollywood film, you cannot run away from songs that keep playing here and there which doesn't sore your eyes nor ears. This one correctly plays itself as a film between genres of sci-fi, mystery, crime, suspense and time fissure. Yes, this is the one and the only Bollywood film, i should say the second known out there in the whole industry of films worldwide to talk and make a film on issue of TIME FISSURE.i'll end to say that neither the film story nor the performances disappoints you if you are going to watch this one. It just requires your attention which i have to admit shamefully that it couldn't earn a fame or collection during it's release in 2013. Hope we can give justice this time."
