" This train's going nowhere, so get on at your own risk.","The Train, incidentally, is an unapologetic, shameless rip-off of the Clive Owen-Jennifer Aniston thriller Derailed, and this desi version's been directed by Hasnain Hyderabadwala and Raksha Mistry who last plagiarised the Tom Cruise starrer Collateral to give us The Killer. Now the thing about The Train is that although it faithfully follows the blueprint of the original film, it does so lethargically at an almost snail-like pace, killing you slowly with its misplaced sense of morality.In a nutshell, the film's about a married man and the price he must pay for adultery. Emraan Hashmi is the man in question, newcomer Sayali Bhagat his wife, and Geeta Basra the other woman. The story's set in Bangkok, although till the end of the film I couldn't figure out why they needed to go outside our very own Filmistan Studio because the directors don't exploit the city to lend character to the story. The basic flaw with The Train is its own inability to understand what story it wants to tell. The screenplay plods along wearily and what's meant to be the big turning point in the plot is so predictable, you've guessed it a good forty minutes before you actually see it happen on screen. Then there are those terrifying performances by Aseem Merchant playing the bad guy, and leading lady Geeta Basra – who's so buried under make-up you can't even see her expressions. Put it all together and you've got a recipe for disaster.The reason The Train fails and so miserably so is because the filmmakers' conviction is so clearly missing in the film. You can't just rip off a Hollywood film frame by frame and expect your film to turn out exactly like the original – no, that's not going to happen. Look at some successful rip-offs – Murder and KaanteYou'll notice both of these films had clearly developed characters and a fairly solid screenplay, even if the screenplays weren't entirely original. The Train sadly has neither, and that's why it's such a royal bore. It's true what I said in the beginning; Emraan Hashmi isn't half as bad as he usually is. He's having a bad hair day and looks a bit like a lost lamb, but that aside, it's an earnest attempt. Not that it helps actually because the film itself is just very difficult to sit through. Hasnain Hyderabadwala and Raksha Mistry's The Train is loose and it's weak and if you ask me honestly, this train's going nowhere, so get on at your own risk." 
" Pull the chain instead","Despite being lifted from a Hollywood flick Derailed (which wasn't exactly a huge hit), The Train was far from entertaining and so predictable that you didn't even have to be of average intelligence to figure out who is bad & who is good although I've not seen Derailed. The film was supposed to be a thriller but wasn't even a jot thrilling, then what is left? The only good scene was the song Woh Ajnabee with its excellent cinematography. The Music is good and the song Woh Ajnabee is one of the best songs of 2007 but what is the use of good music in a bad film? The story was so simple about Vishal Dixit (Emraan Hashmi), a regular middle-class guy, is settled in Bangkok with his wife Anjali (Sayali Bhagat) and their five-year old daughter Nikki. Anjali & Vishal are trying to gather together their deteriorating marriage. One day, on his way to work, Vishal meets Roma (Geeta Basra), a beautiful woman and that is where his miserable life begins. Overall The Train chugged to a slow pace before it ran out of steam. Neither The Train nor its passengers (viewers) reached their destination. In fact, many of them wanted to pull the chain and jump out of the running train." 
" Another copy of Hollywood movie","This is OK movie to watch. Exactly copy of Hollywood movie "Derailed" .. for god sake these directors needs to stop doing plagiarism. Now about movie, nothing great about it or the performance of the character. The girl Geeta (Ms Kapoor) is hot and beautiful and thats only the reason make me keep watching this movie. If you guys have seen derailed then in initial part of the movie only you will realize that its another copy of movie. Anyway overall I'll rate this movie 2/10 as it has some pretty looking girl. Songs of the movie is OK too.. I would say its another concept they are trying to follow like they did with movie Murder." 
" copy of derailed movie(derailed 1) some lines should never be crossed","saw a sneak preview of this film yesterday in mumbai There are some "cheesy" moments but I'm happy to say that they are far and few between.The acting is not academy-award winning but you will be pleased with the performances.It is an engaging film that brings you into a dark and gritty underworld that actually can feel quite real at times. You feel for the lead character.One of the strengths of this film is character development.It also has some twists that may actually surprise you in a good way.I think the real downfall of this film is that it has a "Hollywood" ending. For me the film loses points for this.One final note: the climax, although still good, was pieced together in such a way that it did not hold the tension enough for the theater audience. There was laughter and some heckling in my theater.I wouldn't walk into this film expecting a ground-breaking film that will change the genre forever, but it is does have some good pacing and the story moved al"
