" A good movie but not GREAT!","SOCH is a pretty good movie but it has its share of flaws. It was supposed to be a suspense thriller, judging from its tag line which says "A thought that kills...". But unfortunately, the suspense here is completely missing.The story is quite interesting. A husband fed up with his wife's baseless accusations of carrying on an affair with other woman, unwittingly tells a stranger to kill his wife in exchange for killing the stranger's father. The stranger, psychologically impaired and unpredictable, really does kill the wife. And now, he wants the protagonist to do his bidding and that being killing his father. How the protagonist frees himself from the clutches of the mentally unstable villain forms the rest of the story.The story, no doubt, is novel and refreshing. But it's the treatment that ruins the development of the movie. The screenplay of SOCH is its biggest undoing. A film that counts on its suspense can't be that damn predictable. Every future action of the characters is spelt out loud. The dialogues are so contrived and you can hardly connect to any of the characters.Sanjay Kapoor in this movie, is a big, big letdown. It was an author backed role for him but he does nothing to shine in it. He could've brought new dimensions to a character that had a lot of potentials. But all he does is ham incessantly and like a typical Bollywood hero, fight the antagonist and bring the film to an end.Raveena Tandon looks lost in front of the camera. She's a talented actress and we have witnessed it in her previous flick DAMAN. But here, she fails to give the film her best shot. Her characterization is also very weak.Aditi Govitrikar is pathetic in her second film after a brief role in 16 December. She has a stiff body language, got poor dialogues and cannot emote with her eyes.Arbaaz Khan repeats his psycho act from his debut film Daraar. But he does give a decent account of himself and you end up sympathising with him. Danny Dengzongpa is his usual self and sleep walks through the whole film. Tiku Talsania and Mushtaq Khan are annoying. The rest of the cast are okay.The songs are not worth listening to and can be easily edited out to enhance the film. Editing is slow but the cinematography is noteworthy.The unwanted comedy sequences also act like a sore thumb and hinder the development of the plot to a great extent.Debutante director Sushen Bhatnagar's efforts should be applauded. Because he dared to try something novel and different. But the problem lies in his execution. We hope he comes with a far more better product next time.Overall, a good time-pass flick but not something great. You can watch it at least once. But never ever dare to watch it twice because the flaws of the film will come off in handy then. I rate it 5/10." 
" Great movie","One day i was sitting home watching zeetv when this movie came on . not knowing what it was about i watched to see . what i found was a great movie that seem to went unnoticed . the film stars Sanjay kapoor , Arbaaz khan and raveena tondon . It is a thriller about basically basing its theme on "you scratch my back and ill scratch yours" . one night raj (sanjay kapoor) and Om (arbaaz khan) meet . Om wants his father dead and raj jokes about wanting his wife dead but om doesn't believe he jokes and so he kills her now Om wants raj wants to kill his father (Danny Denzongpa) and if doesn't he threatens to kill raj friend preeti(raveena tondon) .and from there the movie goes ..this isn't the best thriller i have seen but it sure is a great film .the performances - overall arbaaz khan steals the show . sanjay kapoor is OK . and raveena tondon could done better .the music - tohe leke and Dil Dhoonde Hai Idher are some great numbers to look for."
