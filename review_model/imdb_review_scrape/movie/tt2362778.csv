" 'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns' a must watch!","'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns' is a fine woven drama in pure Tigmanshu Dhulia's style and definitely a must watch. The screenplay is humorous, serious, erotic, revengeful & dramatic at the same time. The first half of the movie is good, though second half loses its momentum. The climax is little bit unexpected and should be, neither it would have been just a remake of its first part 'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster'. O.oYou'll feel that you are watching some old classic cinema in between the modern gangsterism. Good performance by all, i.e. Jimmy Sheirgill, Mahie Gill, Irrfan Khan, Soha Ali Khan, but one more time Irrfan is the best. Hats off the writer(Again Tigmanshu) for the super fabulous dialogues, you cannot easily forget them like me. ;) Be aware it's not 'High speed Bullet train' but a 'Tamancha on Bicycle' ; so commercial movie viewers, please stay away. Rating is above average but not more than 7 due to a few weak scenes. :)" 
" A Delicious Thriller!","A sequel to the 2011 semi-hit 'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster', 'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns' Directed by the Supremely Talented Tigmanshu Dhulia, is A Delicious Thriller, that leaves its viewer stunned. A Twisted, Violent & Nail-Biting Film, that is sure to meet with critical & commercial success. 'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns' is about The Royal Scandal, where the war for power & prestige continues.'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns' is stronger & cruder than its prequel. I loved the entire story, its so relentless & unforgiving. Dhulia & Sanjay Chauhan's Screenplay is Twisted, Violent & Nail-Biting! The characters are fabulously written & their actions unfold magnetically. Also, the twists and turns in the narrative are marvelous. Dhulia's Direction is powerful. He dominates every frame with detailing. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is proper. Art & Costume Design, are super. Music by Sandeep Chowta is decent.Performance-Wise: Jimmy Shergill is fantastic. Such control & conviction in a performance is a rarity. Irrfan is spectacular, yet again. Mahie Gill is award-worthy. She plays a complicated part with effortless ease. Soha Ali Khan is at her very best in here. Raj Babbar is incredible in a strong supporting role. Deepraj Rana is effective. Pravesh Rana leaves a mark. Mugdha Godse sizzles in a raunchy item song.On the whole, 'Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns' is a must see. Grab a ticket now!" 
" Awesome Thriller-Intelligent Story and Screenplay- IRRFAN Khan at Best","After Going through all the reviews in IMDb i felt i need to write review for this movie. I can bet that those people giving it less than 8 rating don't know what to watch in a movie. They just want an actor to go 'Dhishum Dhishum' and 'Tathaiya Tathaiya' and no acting. Well let me make it clear that I am an Irrfan Khan fan, so some may find my review biased but believe me, this movie deserves all the praises. Coming to this movie-Direction,Story and Screenplay- Hats off to Tingmanshu Dhulia for making this one better than first part. Intelligently written script with unpredictable plots, so unlikely bollywood. The entire movie will keep people guessing what will happen next. Kept me wondering what will happen next. Acting- Irrfan Khan steals the show as 'Gangster'. Superb acting by this veteran actor. I don't wonder why this man is successful in Bollywood as well as in Hollywood, and not any other bollywood star. Mahie Gill is an intelligent actor and displayed why she is called so in this movie. Very well played role of 'Drunkard Biwi'. Jimmy Shergill also did a wonderful job as 'Saheb'. Soha Ali Khan finally learned acting and didn't let it down.Overall- A wonderful movie that one should watch in theater. But Irrfan Khan steals the show. And the End is too unpredictable and awesome. Worth all the money." 
" SBAGR - Riveting Thriller !","Bolstered by the success and critical acclaim of Saheb Biwi aur Gangster , Director Tigmanshu Dhulia returns with its sequel with much royal paraphernalia, bedroom politics, dialogue-baazi and controlled fireworks. The battle for supreme power continues in the rural heartland with Dhulia splashing his sassy imagination of what happens behind the ramparts of the fading forts.To give you the plot line, the story moves on where the prequel ended, with the crippled,wheel-chair bound Saheb(Jimmy Shergill) and his alcoholic estranged Biwi/Chotti Rani,Madhavi(Mahie Gill)who is now an MLA , fighting off the assault launched by the revenge-thirsty but penniless Raja Bhaiyya (Irfaan Khan in top-form)whose fiefdom was snatched away by Saheb's ancestors.The fourth dimension to this plot is Ranjana (Soha Ali Khan) who is in love with Raja. Things take a turn when Saheb falls in love with Ranjana and arm-twists his father,Raja Birender(Raj Babbar) to agree to their marriage.Tigmanshu instills dollops of intrigue to this riveting drama with his dubious and vicious characters which marks his prolificacy as a film- maker and showcases his grasp on the socio-political dynamics.His brand of cinema emanates from the grassroots, the settings are vibrant yet dark, dramatic yet humorous. If there is the Saheb and Biwi playing the bitter antagonists, you also have the self-proclaimed ruler, Raja who accompanies the Biwi in the twin pleasures of bottle and flesh.Like the porn-crazy politician who is still illiterate in operating his laptop and relates himself to a Tomato! Tigmanshu finds humour in tragedy and satire in reality.He gives an ethnic and rustic feel to the dialogues, a life to the otherwise dilapidated royal mansion and an exposure to the etiquettes of the royal trappings. His inclination to poignancy is testimonized by the haunting score of 'Lag Ja Gale' which forms a metaphor to the characters' emotional hollow.SBAGR is indeed performances galore.Improving with every outing by leaps and bounds, Jimmy shergill is in dazzling form who portrays angst, his animosity towards his wife and the egoistic evil with perfect flourish. As the seductive Chotti Rani,Mahie not only looks ravishing in chiffons but also gives her character the required impetus to depict her yearning for love through her drunken drawl.Irfaan Khan is the Betaaj Badhshah of this enterprise!He displays an array of emotions with so much of conviction that you crave "once more ! once more!".Soha Ali plays her part with good degree of sophistication and she provides an interesting counterpart to Biwi's character. Raj Babbar is his usual charismatic self while Rajeev Gupta as the politician is superbly impressive!I go with 4 out of 5 for Tigmanshu Dhulia's Saheb Biwi aur Gangster Returns. As the game of chess gets chequered,we are in for an explosive interplay of love, lust and betrayal.Don't miss." 
" Its an intense sequel in the right sense but still falls short of the huge expectations from the director.","The talented team of Tigmanshu Dhulia and Irrfan Khan has missed only once in the past with CHARAS, which was in fact a decent engrossing watch released in 2004. Apart from that the team is known for its worth watching gems such as HAASIL (2003) and PAAN SINGH TOMAR (2010) which were also duly awarded with their deserving honors. So after the fine SAHEB BIWI AUR GANGSTER (2011), I was excited enough to watch the talented duo together in its sequel, titled in a routine manner as SAHEB BIWI AUR GANGSTER RETURNS.But sadly the film turned out to be quite less impressive than expected with few great sequences in its first half and many unimpressive ones in the later leading towards a lackluster climax. To begin with the most questionable addition in the film, the title itself is not justified well since there is no gangster in the movie as such. The word GANGSTER has been forcibly imposed upon Irrfan Khan, who actually is from a local reputed family eager to take his revenge from the SAHEB. Continuing the story further (like a true sequel) we have the differently able SAHEB full of that old, hollow, seen before proud of his lost dynasty or power and the BIWI who is still the same man-eater lady, enjoying her new political status in a drunkard state. SBAGR begins with 3 brilliant sequences introducing the SAHIB, BIWI and GANGSTER played well by Jimmy, Mahie and Irrfan together. However this time the film doesn't entirely focuses upon the BIWI alone since we have another lady in the house too enacted by Soha Ali Khan. Moreover the sequel here is actually focused upon the men for a change, which might disappoint a few who wish to see some more skin-show taking a clue from its prequel. The interesting clashes within the characters begin once the intro part is over, followed by few enjoyable sequences like the one where Irrfan is interviewing a Politician watching porn on his laptop in the office itself. As a known feature of a Tigmanshu Dhulia project, all the impressive scenes are well supported by many brilliantly written lines too worth applauding.In short, it all progresses at a fine pace till the intermission as expected from the director and his talented cast. But unfortunately the same cannot be said about the film in its second half. The pace drops and the narration struggles to deliver the shocking twists due to many unwanted clichéd scenes like Jimmy standing up from his wheel chair, the feeble track of royal families having a nexus with the politicians and their locking up together in a room for few days. Further a mediocre item song surely puts you into a doubtful thinking mode as it is certainly not what Tigmanshu is known for in the industry as a path breaking director.Also I was really not convinced at all with its ineffective and debatable climax wherein Irrfan commits suicide despite of being the owner of so powerful or confident character and Jimmy gets caught by the police so easily despite of being highly influential in politics and underworld, a person who can also get one framed in a crime out of the country. The writing reduces the film to an average product in its final hour wherein it loses a substantial ground in terms of entertainment offered to the common man. The usual amusing shocks in the script of a Dhulia film are missing and the film once again ends on an open note making way for its another forced sequel in the near future.In visual term, SBAGR literally transports you into that regional ambiance of Raja Sahebs and their personal constituencies of the gone era superbly. The framework capturing all the grey characters in their various acts is simply outstanding and the background score compliments the look and feel of the film quite adequately. On the other hand, its soundtrack is strictly below average which clearly indicates that a Tigmanshu Dhulia film actually does not require any full length songs at all posing as hindrancesIn the performances department the film has a terrific act by Irrfan Khan who had a tailor made role perfectly matching his famous image on the screen. As a surprise Jimmy supports him well with a towering performance and it really feels good to appreciate him after a long gap (post many acts full of arrogance and attitude). Mahie takes it on right from where she left in the first part and is sure going to get many more fans on her side after this fabulous sensuous, drunkard act of a clever woman. Joining the trio, Soha too proves her caliber boldly by making her presence felt in the scenes crowded by a powerful cast.Raj Babbar impresses and Parvesh Rana (Big Boss fame) makes a confident debut as the newly appointed Inspector in the supporting cast. Though I felt his role didn't have any basic requirement, still the boy makes the best use of the opportunity given impressively. Posing as Jimmy's right hand, Deepraj Rana says a lot with his eyes only whereas both Anjana Sukhani and Mugdha Godse (as the Item Girls) remain wasted. Complimenting the talented ensemble, Rajeev Gupta as the politician rightly provides the much needs comical relief in his few sequences which can easily be called the highlight of the film undoubtedly. Concluding the review, SBAGR has an engrossing, intense first half and an average second resulting in more or less the same impact as generated by its prequel. Still it indeed can be rated as an enjoyable watch just for its characters and performances." 
" Game of Power,Politics and Seduction returns..","The sequel returns with powerful punch Lines and Dialogues. Yet again Brilliance of director (also story,screenplay and dialogue writer) Tigmanshu Dhulia.Man abuse more because they don't cry,You have become so cheap i don't even have change to give you these kind of punch lines are soul of movie. Rest is just another power and sex oriented thriller.Though its a delightful watch "Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster returns" could have been another class if editing was bit tighter. In between it seem dragging on screen while difficult to keep track of who is with whom and what's their purpose with their flipping loyalties. The relation between "Saheb and Biwi" is still unfathomable. When love becomes hate and when hate becomes love is enigma to decipher (Yet I believe such relation exists). Everything else just circle around power, politics and vendetta.Jimmy Shergill (Saheb) and Irfan Khan (Indrajit Singh) doing their best as a central characters. Mahie Gill (Biwi) good but sometimes irritating with her tone and overdoing. Rest did their part. And one more thing I liked in both parts is back-ground scores. The score which was played before building of certain situations was pleasure to listen and provided some different feeling.Verdict : 7.5/10 For Keeping conversations deadly but missing out bit of crisp editing." 
" Sahib Biwi and Gangster..returns!!","...Brace yourself up to get brushed with the ROYAL paints of Romance, Revenge, Power,Politics,Jealousy,Treachory,Adultery, all mixed in one. Voluptious Mahi Gil as the seductress is a BIWI every husband would prefer only on Theater or TV. Vodka is not enough to quench her thirst for Power .. Jimmy sher-DIL, as SAHEB, is on wheels but he's still got those balls of steel as he tries all the dirty means to retain his Hukumat as the King... But the man to watch out for is Irfan Khan.. a GANGSTER, with Romance and Revenge both reflecting in his bulging eyes, on a mission to destroy the rule of SAHEB, unaware of what the BIWI has in store for him ... With punchy dialogues Saheb Biwi and Gangster returns as a perfect desi thriller with double the twists and turns and is worth every penny....!!!!" 
" A Scrutinizing Thriller! Enjoyed It!","The first movie was great in all its glory. Now, the sequel just makes the series a must-see. Irrfan Khan is so fabulous in SBAG that all other actors fall below. Jimmy Shergill & Mahie Gill are equally talented and perform very well. Soha Ali Khan is average moreover her portrayal did not amuse me.The type of thriller this, might look clichéd to some, but the final stages of the second half are truly magnificent. From the time it hits the interval, the plot gets gripping and you shouldn't miss a single sequence, because the screenplay is ballistic, direction is professional and cinematography is pure. Had the music been extravagant, I would have rated it 10. Now, even if you haven't watched the predecessor, this one will mar you with Tigmanshu's forte which is filming in a neo-urban style.SBAG is a must watch this March, because such a powerful movie hasn't been released before in 2013 and well, the previous week's releases were too gaudy. Special appreciation for Mahi's bold look and Jimmy's glamorous avatar. This one is no simple cinema as it will make you think and growl towards the end.BOTTOM LINE: 100% recommended if you love pure performances.WATCH OUT FOR: Irrfan Khan & Jimmy Shergill!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOLanguage: Mediocre | Sex: Strong (Porn included) | Nudity: Strong | Mouth-Kiss & Foreplay: Strong | Alcohol: Very Strong | Violence: Critical | Gore: Mild | Smoking or Drugs: No" 
" Cult masterpiece by tigmashu dhulia","Standing ovation for tigmanshu dhulia & powerful performances of jimmy shergill , irfan , mahie gill ...Both jimmy , mahie have performed like lion & lioness of jungle ...Power , greed ,politics , lust , betrayal , love ,revenge , everything here ..Must watch this masterpiece ...Hats off to tigmanshu dhulia .." 
" Really a must watch classic thriller movie!!!","Didn't watch the 1st part, but picked this up based on some gud reviews online. And the movie was really well made, no big stars in the cast (Irfan is a star now, but one who still accepts characters that offer good scope for acting, hence getting his nod for Dhigmanshu dhulia wasn't a challenge i believe & also after Paan Singh Tomar's success), all the stars chosen based on their acting skills and their ability to do gud movies.No lag anywhere, right from beginning to end, there are many twists & turns which kept me riveted to my seat.Jimmy Sherfill does well as the king who still is still trying to control things in his area, along with his trusted body guard 'kannayya' who also does a gud job.Of course Irfan Khan rocks, his dialogue delivery is stunning, also thanks to the writers. Same with Jimmy Shergill, his punches owe their credit to the writers again.Raj Babbar also does a gud job.I highly recommend this movie to everybody if you want to watch a gud movie with a wonderful cast, gud writing and thrilling at the same time." 
" SBaG Returns -- Couldn't stand expectations","SBaG Returns has politics, romance, drama with some very predictable twists. This would be excellent watch who hasn't seen much of this genre's movies. Although having weak and predicable storyline, the film is backed by too good narration and clear portrayal of all characters.I am big fan of Irfan khan and if i praise him it will be form of bias. But he is fabulously convincing actor and he proves one more time. Jimy, This actor is shining like polished diamond and getting better and better, last performance i saw was in Tanu Weds Manu, this is no less. Kudos ! Mahi and Soha too did justice to their characters. The story of love, politics, revenge, falling in lust for getting to love, misunderstandings, bizarre climax -- is now highly common in Bollywood politics drama. Watch this for Irfan and Jimmy's performances and excellent narration!" 
" Kingdom is shaking","Score 5/10 Director Mr. Tigmanshu Dhulia has elaborated the minute's details of scenes very well but fails to develop a sensible an interesting story. Making an independent film is another thing but making a sequel always directly or indirectly pressurizes the Director. You always try to go beyond the credentials of its first part. Before interval the movie is good but second half is very slow and illogical. For example, a person intrudes in Raja Saheb house just like cakewalk. Once he parks his huge SUV in front of gate and jumps the boundary wall and enters the Haveli but no one notices him or his SUV. Even it happens in night but not digestible. If that person is brave enough to take the risk but unnecessary risk is stupidity. Two persons meet discreetly in night in an isolated place but prefer to keep the inside light of vehicle on. Characterization is bad. A person, who had born to take revenge, when there is strong reason to attack he prefers to suicide. Raja Saheb is strong enough to take care of Police and law and order, so framing him was of no use. Story is not good. Few scenes are good. Especially the scene where, Irrfan Khan comes to take the interview of chief minister. This scene is very fresh and hilarious. Dialogues by Mr. Tigmanshu Dhulia are fantastic. Performance wise Irrfan Khan as Indrajeet Singh is good. Jimmy Shergil as Raja Saheb is OK. Mahi Gill is fine. A scene when she goes to meet the Commissioner, when she comes out. The way she walks reveals the incident happened inside. That is very subtle and great. Soha Ali Khan is OK. Deep Raaj Rana as Kanhaiya is fine. An Actor who played the role of Minister R. Tiwari is impressive. Music by Sandeep Chowta is below average. Even they inserted an item song to lure certain audience but song in not impressive." 
" Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster Returns- sizzling film noir","Of delusional maharajahs and erotic maharanis, twisted politicians and violent gangsters, of love in its many shades- Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster Returns is a worthy sequel indeed. Director Tigmanshu Dhulia presents a master class in direction, screenplay, cinematography, art and costume design and of course a story acted out in equal class by modern legends.Picking up from 2011's Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster's ending which left a crippled, wheelchair bound Saheb (Jimmy Shergill), an alcoholic, estranged Biwi and a dead Gangster (Randeep Hooda), this time round Saheb is looking for a second wife and unilaterally selects Ranjana (Soha Ali Khan)- daughter of rival politician Raja Birendar (Raj Babbar) arm-twisting his approval in the process. Ranjana though is in love with gangster Raja Bhaiyya (Irfan Khan) who has personal scores to settle with Saheb. Battle lines are drawn, and Saheb seems to be cornered. But of course Dhulia has a script of Machiavellian proportions- as in the first movie all the characters are brutal and scheming, so twists and turns galore will keep you guessing what the next move will be for each of the characters.While Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster Returns may not be as original as the prequel, Dhulia masterminds a coupe through a script that has oodles of dark humor. One would expect this is a Irfan Khan movie, but no, it is a Jimmy Shergill movie- it has taken him 16 years (since Maachis in 1996) to get a leading man status, and here as the cruel, calculating Saheb he is towering. Mahie Gills is delightfully caricatured as the alcoholic wife- looks ravishing and wears a sari as if it were made just for her. Irfan is chameleon like as usual – slips into the role of a gangster madly in love with élan, while Soha Ali Khan is adequate as the innocent Ranjana, the polar opposite of Mahie's character. The side characters are even more colorful- Raj Babbar is effective, Pravesh Rana is actually incredible as a corrupt cop, Rajeev Gupta as the idiotic, porn loving, tech-unfriendly chief minister just rocks.So there it is- not a big, bang hollow action flick, but a nuanced, intelligent thriller straight from the heartland of India. Romance, revenge, politics, adultery, jealousy all rolled in one fine effort. Watch it when in the mood for some quality cinema, you will come out smiling. 8/10" 
" It could be a better option if you do not have anything else to watch","SBGR was an average sequel to 2011's Sahib Biwi aur Gangster which has nothing much to offer except for good performances by the lead stars.SBGR solemnly focuses on the war in the state of UP for ultimate power. Aditya Pratap Singh urges for the power , Indrajeet Singh wants to avenge by killing Aditya , Madhavi Devi wants get rid of her husband Aditya and Ranjana's father uses her to release his son kidnapped by Aditya. Coming from the powerhouse director , Tigmanshu Dhulia who has given us wonderful Paan Singh Tomar, SBGR disappoints big time. Frankly speaking , I never liked the first part itself but my expectation was quite high as Irrfan Khan was added to star cast. The film gathers some steam in between but falls out in later reel. The movie has some strong performances and moments but it looses the track with half-baked screenplay. To make it worst , songs comes as a big hindrance. Overall , I felt it was an unnecessary sequel to proceed. It could be a better option if you do not have anything else to watch. Average 2.5/5"
