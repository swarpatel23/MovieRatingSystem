" A tale of human triumph","Over the years many movies worldwide had left mark due to their theme which surpassed the flaws in the film. Soundtrack is one such film which injects optimism and hope even though the second half of the film has loopholes. Inspired from "Its all gone Pete Tong" Soundtrack is the journey of Raunaq (Superb acting from Rajeev Khandelwal), a small town boy who comes to Mumbai to make it big and leave his mark in history of music. With a District 9 like mocumentary set-up we are introduced to Raunaq through interview of many personalities who knew him at a personal level while others are established individuals like Anurag Kashyap, Kailash Kher, DJ Akeel and more. The movie moves in a back and forth narrative with quotes of Beethoven in between thus narrating the journey of Raunaq and how he loses his sense of hearing followed by a brave tale of light amidst darkness. Neerav Ghosh's adaptation of Its all gone Pete Tong has its moment that touches the chord. Even though the second hour is a bit hurried it is the heart warming sequences between two deaf person and their will power to succeed that touched the chord of audience. The first hour involving lots of substance abuse and sex has been dealt with maturity never losing focus on Raunaq's character. The concept of alter-ego was brilliantly done and for a change it is not shown through the eyes' of the protagonist. The sequences are shown as if a camera is fitted in the room from where we can see a panoramic view of Raunaq's mind where the alter-ego "Johny Joker" plays a important role. Being a sound designer himself the background score of Soundtrack is brilliant. With each tone, each frequency reflecting and setting the mood for the frame it is one of the finest work in recent times in terms of background score. Even Medieval Pundits had a good understanding of the script which got reflected from the music. The use of old songs were apt and "ruka jana Na nehi" is still humping in my ear. Sanjay Roderick and Ambar Vyas did a good job in editing without complicating the narrative. Anshuman Malay's cinematography was in sync with the story. The usage of shades of Grey was appropriate when Raunaq was fighting his inner demon to bring back his hearing powers. But amidst the positives there were flaws which somehow were prominent. While the first half was moving at an even pace in a mocumentary style the second half seem to be a bit hurried and the screenplay was naive towards the climax which was more like any normal Hindi film. Yes it is agreed that the story was about the success of human will and how Raunaq (like Beethoven) creates music without hearing, but pre-climax build up could have been more matured. But then the ending was brilliant. Neerav Ghosh remained true to "Its all gone Pete tong" and let's hope that he does a better job with an original story.Rajeev Khandel simply rocked as Raunaq. This is his third film (after Aamir and Shaitan) and he showed that he can carry a film on his shoulder. His choice of films are good and he will be remembered in the long run for the matured roles he did. In the initial reels his eye reflected his ambition, then his arrogance, his dilemma, his downfall and then his rise again – he excelled in each and every sequence. Soha Ali Khan was surprisingly good in the role of Gauri, another deaf girl who changed Raunaq's life. Generally person who are deaf by birth have speech problems and Soha enacted such a role with ease. But the mushy sequences with Raunaq didn't have that impact more because of the faulty screenplay in the second hour. Mohan Kapoor was Excellent as Charlie indeed showed a split personality like the name of his night club "Tango Charlie". Yateen Karyekar was decent as Raunaq's uncle. Mrinalini Sharma playing the role of Raunaq's model girlfriend Shonali looked hot and stunning, that's it. Manu Rishi made effective brief appearances. Anurag Kashyap in a brief appearance as him made himself noticed with his unique style of dialog delivery. Others were decent in their respective roles.On the whole Soundtrack is not a perfect film but it should be viewed for the effective portrayal of human will against all odds. "Ruk Jaana Nahin Tu Kahin Haar Ke, Kaanton Pe Chal Ke Milenge Saaye Bahaar Ke" – this song indeed sums up the film." 
" Highly recommended!","In recent times, Bollywood has witnessed many melodramatic remakes (most of them, remade from South Indian movies). Soundtrack, though a remake of Canadian movie It's all Gone Pete Tong (officially mentioned in the end credits of the movie), is thankfully not over-the-top.Rajeev Khandelwal as Raunak Kaul is just marvelous. He is thoroughly in sync with his character and he has proved his versatility with this movie. He transits well from a DJ hunk to a deaf musician. Mrinalini Sharma is unbelievably hot. Soha Ali Khan acts well (yes, you read it right). Both the ladies represent contradictions in Rajeev's character. Mrinalini makes you go high in first half and Soha makes you feel dry in second. Soundtrack, has very good music but the background score of the movie sounds a bit pale. Two songs, Naina Lagey and Banao are placed wrongly in background score, which can't be digested in a musical drama. The "Johnny Joker" element added to make it a bit artistic movie, is appreciative, but not needed.Camera works is fancy. Cinematography is brilliant.Dialogues are fresh, crisp and hap devoid of any melodrama, which is commendable. Direction is good, not excellent.The movie could have been narrated in a heroic way but the director chooses a subtle and documentary kind(not to misinterpret as a mediocre way) of narration giving it an artistic touch rather than commercial appeal. Don't trust the reviewers that rate Bodyguard as first class, and do go for this movie. You won't be disappointed." 
" Just Go For it! It's a nice one","This is my first review,I'm writing because this movie is really underrated.It is a nice movie the acting of Rajeev and Soha is really great and they live upto their expectations.The movie has some flaws but overall it's an entertainer with a deep message.It's a really good movie for a debuting Director.The Cinematography was excellently done.The music is great too.This is a fresh movie with fresh dialogues and story this is what Bollywood Cinema needs not some nonsense Action movie in which hero is superhero.Soha Ali Khan's role is exceptional and for the first time I have to admit it,she did good acting.I don't see any reason why this movie performed poorly on box office.Go ahead watch it!" 
" Fabulous music and superb acting...Go for it...","After long time writing another review as it made me to write review due to its story telling and impact on my mind. I wanted to write review of Ra-one also but its already much late so writing review of Soundtrack.When the movie was released I haven't watched its single trailer only heard its songs and was knowing that Rajeev Khandelwal is there and I decided to watch it in theatre as he always do powerful movies. But somehow I couldn't. But yesterday I finally got the chance to watch it.Story: Raunak Kaul (Rajeev Khandelwal) is a master turntablist who spins at a nightclub in what is implied as Bandra, the hip Mumbai suburb. One day he goes deaf. Does he plunge deeper into his cocaine-and-whiskey path towards perdition and hell? Or does he crawl back up to life and music? There's that tantalizing promise—the promise of a man's redemption after he has hit the abyss with drugs, bad decisions, being in love with the wrong person, and a sudden physical disability.When I watched this movie I first searched about its director and music director, and surprisingly I found both debutant in movie and I gone gaga over them. After watching I felt that now how many well made movies like this goes flop but we are getting too many people who has something new to give to bollywood. I know movie is remake of Canadian movie but it needs many efforts to make successful remake also.In direction department, Debutant Neeraj Ghosh blew away my mind by giving such fabulous start in bollywood. No doubt movie losses its charm at many places, like he could have shown Raunak's inner split person more effective (Like it was in a beautiful mind, Shutter island etc.) but in the first time its really too good work. Director has managed movie by showing it documentary cum drama movie with such a fabulous music.In script and screenplay department, movie also takes credits as it is well written and executed. Still it loses ¬focus at many places and can be developed more but still its too much effective.In acting department, Hats off to Rajeev Khandelwal. He never fails to our expectation and always leaves much impact by being like the real character. He impresses in every shade weather as DJ or as psycho or as deaf person. Soha ali khan has done his part well. Mohan kapoor is entertaining. Mrinalini Sharma is OK. Loved special appearance of everyone.Music and song department of the movie needs to be impressive in the musical film and so it is in this movie. Almost all songs are well made and well placed. Starting music and when Raunak feels the music first time after being deaf are awesome.In short, the movie is power pack surprise with superb acting, Fabulous music and well executed story with some lake of ineffective scenes. (Must watch for the bollywood lovers who like something different.)" 
" A fine adaptation of IT's ALL GONE PETE TONG (2004), going one step ahead than Bhasal's Guzaarish.","This week's offbeat offering SOUNDTRACK is a legitimate remake of IT's ALL GONE PETE TONG (2004), which is based on the tragic life story of a famous DJ, who suddenly becomes deaf and then disappears mysteriously. Where the original is a kind of comedy made in a mockumentary style giving it an authentic feel, its Hindi remake is a rather serious adaptation of the film taking a somber look at the subject and its protagonist's life. Secondly the film is full of mature content including sequences of abuses, drug addiction and sex. So it should not be chosen as your choice for a family outing in this festive weekend.Talking about its present Hindi version, it's a great choice of subject by its debutant director Neerav Ghosh, as the plot is new and has a fresh storyline, moving ahead of the routine stuff offered to the Indian audience. Though, I cannot give the credit of its brilliant story idea and various thoughtful sequences to Neerav, since he religiously follows the Original film in his adaptation. But the director does show his sparkling talent in the film and makes a difference.A deserving mention has to be made for Neerav's own contribution in the execution wherein he very smartly even surpasses the original in several instances. Like, he replaces the ugly bear of the original with a Joker in SOUNDTRACK which is a relief and then tackles the subject in a more sensitive way with the introduction of Soha Ali Khan in the film post intermission. Where the film doesn't really justify its subject of a passionate, crazy DJ's story in the first half, it intelligently covers it all with a great second half which depicts the positivity between its lead characters Soha and Rajeev, superbly. And also the character of Mohan Kapur comes out to be much better in the Hindi version with an enhanced role in the script.Strictly made on the lines of ITS ALL GONE PETE TONG, Neerav's SOUNDTRACK is shot well with a fine background score and some great inspiring scenes and well written dialogues. But the film is not perfect in every sense as it has some dull moments too in its otherwise engaging direction which hampers the real impact of the movie. Taking a clue from its title, I was really expecting some great songs in the film which were sadly not there. However, the use of real life celebrity clips (including names like Anurag Kashyap, Kailash Kher, Anu Malik, VJ Bani and many more), successfully give an authentic feel to the project impressing the viewer. But actually it's the last 15 minutes of the film which really work and you walk out thinking about the present life of RAUNAQ the DJ who strikes back as a fighting spirit even after becoming deaf and then goes into his self chosen exile.The biggest drawback of the film is that despite of giving a spirited performance in the lead role, Rajeev Khandelwal somehow doesn't look like a passionate, mad DJ who lives heavily on boozing, drugs and sex. No doubt, Rajeev shows his deep understanding of the medium by choosing this film and does deliver his best too but its actually his physical appearance which doesn't match with the drug addict character on the screen. Still, he performs well and once again proves his acting mettle on the screen. On the other side both Soha Ali Khan as his teacher and Mohan Kapur as his manager are really good supporting him brilliantly. Specifically Soha plays it very brave by accepting such kind of role at this point of her career.Working on the original script, director Neerav Ghosh also adds many Indian Family values into the film, which complement the overall impact of the movie and do not look like added deliberately. Hence on the whole, SOUNDTRACK is a well attempted inspiring movie which though cannot be called a perfect project but still has got the power to infuse a lot of positivity into the viewer.As per the journey of the Deaf DJ in SOUNDTRACK, he clearly goes one step ahead than the journey of the bed ridden magician in GUZAARISH, simply redefining the meaning of PASSION and its importance in a person's life.Though as a film, SOUNDTRACK is neither a masterpiece nor it will get some great results at the box office. But still it can easily become an alarming clock in our lives, which can make us realize the immeasurable value of all those numerous gifts granted to us by the Existence, which we just keep on enjoying without even noticing them throughout our life. So, if you are game for watching something out of the routine with a great message, then do watch SOUNDTRACK and feel the passion." 
" Surprising","A surprisingly good movie. Just caught up with this movie when it was shown on our local cable movie channel. I found this movie quite interesting. It definitely could have been a lot better but some fine performances by Soha Ali Khan, Rajiv Khandelwal and Mohan Kapoor kept the interest in the movie up.The story is about a music composer / DJ (played by Rajeev Khandewal) who's career is rocked by a sudden deafness due to constant loud music, high consumption of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. Enter Gauri, who too is deaf but still helps Rajeev come to terms with his disability.Wouldn't say don't miss it but yes, if you get a chance, do watch it." 
" Good but could have been better...","I saw the movie in its premiere show and i liked the movie at the first go with good performances and one song that i especially like, 'Ek manzil'. The movie like every movie has its own share of flaws and virtues but sometimes at some part of the movie the former wins over the latter. The connection with the audience of the lead character is minimum due to which while watching the movie, the required sympathy do not comes in watching the scene where Rajeev is going through a turnmoil due to his handicap. We just feel it like of any other twist in the tale. Soha ali khan was lisping for no reason and it looked awkward on her, either they should have explained the reason for that or have completely done away with the thing. Mohan kapoor was a relief to watch and provided some comic and exciting moment, sometimes you would just wait for Mohan Kapoor to come on screen. Soha was OK and Mrinalini was OK too in her first long length role. The climax of the movie is not something that will raise the adrenaline flow in your nerves and by the end you will a desire for some thing more from the film but in return you will only get the credit roles. Manu Rishi was wasted for his level of talent. Songs are pretty good as i already mentioned my favorite one. All and all a good effort and good one time watch. Recommended."
