" I Feel Cheated","There are different expressions and feelings one has when he comes out of a theater after watching a film. At times I am thinking, at times smiling, at times in awe of what I just saw and at times thanking myself for not being one of the characters. When I came out of the houseful theater on the first day second show of Tees Maar Khan (TMK), the only emotion I had was anger. Sheer anger. I felt cheated and betrayed and disappointed. This is going to be the worst review I will ever write for a movie.Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om did not go too well with me either and I am not too agreed with the Farah Khan way of filmmaking but TMK still managed to shock me. Farah is a fantastic choreographer but as a director, she just killed a cine-goer inside me. The best thing about this two and a half hour was the promo of 'No One Killed Jessica'. I am so looking forward to that.Apparently an official remake of After the Fox, TMK is a story (if it can be called a story) of a con artist pretending to be a film director to put his hands on 10 tons of precious antiques. During this process you come across Three Gay partners of TMK: I don't know why they act gay but they do. Probably it was supposed to be funny. Two Gay cops chasing TMK: they don't act gay; they are gays and they even hint at marrying each other. Three Gay villagers: they become friends with Katrina Kaif and she calls them girls. Twin Criminal brothers: and they are not just twins, they are conjoined twins. Not to forget, they wear gay clothes and act gay too.With all this overdose of gay jokes, there are idiotic police officers trying to nail TMK down and they crack unbelievably horrible jokes. There is TMK's mother who is slightly better than the rest when it comes to being funny. The film starts with a lousy animated title song of a baby in the mother's womb and he has his eye brow pierced even then. In the time when special effects have gone to a new level, TMK brings a basic animation which makes you wonder where the film is headed to.Songs come out of nowhere and are forcefully fitted in to the scenes. The overly hyped Sheila comes and goes in the first fifteen minutes. A scene finishes and TMK decides to call his friend Salman Khan of Dabangg for a song and dance. Are you serious? The choreography, however, is good. 'Wallah Re Wallah' and 'Bade Dil Wala' were enjoyable.The film has Akshay Khanna as Aatish Kapoor in the worst possible supporting actor role. He plays a film actor who wants to win Oscar just like Anil Kapoor did for Slumdog. Interestingly, Anil never won an Oscar for that film. Aatish also comes up with his own version of Jai Ho called 'Day Ho'. Yes, Day as in DAY TIME. He thinks it's funny and dances on this song with great zeal. He is probably mocking Saif Ali Khan because he is also seen in a Saif like bandana.Katrina Kaif has lost a lot of weight and looks good with her navel show throughout the film. She is one actress who follows the director's brief to the tee because she knows she is not talented enough to improvise. Here too, she seems to be following the director's brief and overacts as much as possible. Actually, she overacts more than it's humanly possible for any actress.Actress, I said, because Akshay Kumar is also there. What was he thinking? I have no idea. To start with, 50% of the times he also acts gay and delivers his dialog with lady-like hand movement and voice. Mostly when he is playing the movie director. It seems to be deliberate a take on Karan Johar though. Here is an actor who was touching the pinnacle of his career a year back with highest grossing and enjoyable films but since Singh is King he has come up with one dud after another.The less said about Farah the better it is. My main culprit, however, is Shirish Kunder. Mr. Kunder is trying to pull up a one-man-show here. He is the writer, editor, lyricist and even the producer of TMK. As an editor, he has a credible history but as a writer his previous work is 'Jaan-e-man' which he also directed. That Akshay starrer was also a pretty lousy show. I would strongly suggest Mr. Kunder to remain in his limits i.e. editing.TMK is likely to have a 50 crore opening weekend which has so far been achieved only by Dabangg. It will be a shame if it grosses more than Dabangg did because Dabangg was a very highly entertaining effort. TMK will for sure recover its cost and make profits for the producers (which is unfair) but I don't expect it to do well with audience in the second week onwards.I go to the cinema with the expectations to at least get value for my money and time. In that regard, TEES MAAR KHAN is not a movie. It's a CRIME and the people behind it need to be punished in such a way that it becomes example for others attempting to create such a shame." 
" Absolute rubbish","What kind of a film is this? There is no story whatsoever, not one joke is funny and everyone screams, screams, screams and screams in the film till you want to kill yourself in frustration.All the jokes in the film are in poor taste and just about everyone is made fun of. This is the kind of film that makes you wonder whether the writers of the film have any common sense or rather, does this film have any writer in the first place.The only saving grace is Akshaye Khanna who is in form and performs well as the Oscar-hungry actor.It seems as if Akshay Kumar wants to end his film career by choosing to do films such as this and his string of pathetic films in the past 2 years.Director Farah Khan has shown a lot of promise in her first 2 films and must write scripts herself instead of entrusting this responsibility to others.Shiela Ki Jawani has been superbly choreographed and the end credits are in trademark Farah Khan style.But are you ready to endure two hours of torture for 10 minutes of fun? Trust me, it's not worth it.A nonsensical, idiotic, lame and senseless film. Avoid it at all costs." 
" What the FK is going on?","Farah Khan (FK) seems to have lost her bearings with this one. Being fun loving and irreverent is one thing, but making a movie full of PJs is really pushing it! Akshay Kumar's brand of comedy seems completely out of sync with Farah's brand of humor and the result is a disaster only made tolerable if you are salivating over Katrina Kaif grooving to 'Sheila Ki Jawani' or seeing Akshay and Salman dance together. The script is pretty nonsensical and a stretch even by outrageous plot standards (a conman making a fake movie and convincing a big Bollywood star that it will win an Oscar? Seriously, give me a break!!) and the jokes are pretty weak all through. Tees Maar Khan, for lack of a worser word, is utter trash!" 
" Inane and Pedestrian!","TEES MAAR KHAN Bollywood is replete with examples of fetishes of film makers who closely associate these fetishes with the success of their films. The earliest example is that of film maker J Omprakash who always wanted his movie titles to begin with A; and in recent times we have the example of Karan Johar, who has a similar fetish with the letter K. Farah Khan, who began her career as a choreographer and quickly moved into the shoes of another Khan choreographer (Saroj Khan) quickly won a lot of acclaim for her work and then decided to expand her role to include film direction. Having got the box-office ringing with her first two ventures, MAIN HOON NA and OM SHANTI OM (both of which had Shah Rukh Khan playing the lead), she perhaps concluded that since both the films had three words, three is a lucky number for her. So soon after the success of the first two movies, she gave birth to triplets and her husband, an electronics engineer, Shirish Kunder and she floated a production house called Three's Company! She also perhaps knew that the presence of Shah Rukh Khan in the first two movies was a big factor for the success of those movies, but because she was not having him in her next movie (I will not go into the reasons for that here), she felt that the word KHAN appearing in the title would help. When she was finding it difficult to combine the word KHAN with her fetish for "TEEN" to get the title of her new movie, I presume a well-wisher perhaps told her that using a multiplication factor of ten would triple the chances of the movie's success; thus the word "TEES" came into the title. The choice of the third word was relatively easy, since the phrase TEES MAAR KHAN connoted a braggart and which was in tune with the character of the script itself. The next exercise was to find an inspiration for this tale and happily for her, that was also a three worded Peter Sellers starrer: AFTER THE FOX. Also, perhaps other well wishers suggested to her that she must have as many Ks as was possible in the film crew and therefore had her husband Kunder work for the background music, write(?) the story, co-produce and write some of the lyrics. The star cast also had a number of Ks: AKshay Kumar, AKshaye Khanna, Katrina Kaif, Sachin KhedeKar and special artistes like Salman Khan and Anil Kapoor! Now about the movie itself. Claiming to be a parody, it turns out to be a rather inane effort. Several scenes of the movie looked utterly pedestrian both in conception and execution and the only saving grace is the performance of Akshaye Khanna in the role of an Oscar hungry actor. Of course, the review will not be complete without the mention of the much touted Sheela Ki Jawaani number by Katrina Kaif; but Katrina with her innocent looks doesn't ooze with oomph despite the raunchy lyrics and the dance movements. I would rate Munni Badnaam from Dabangg (also choreographed by Farah) as a better song although the joke which I heard when I was coming out from the theatre was: Agar Sheela Ki Jawaani Pehle Aati, to Munni Badnaam Na Hoti!" 
" Worst Movie of 2010","TMK is the worst movie of 2010. The story is awful and direction of Farah Khan is even more awful. I wish Farah had put more effort in script rather than songs. Apart from Akshay Kumar nothing is this movie is good. Some of his cheeky dialogues will make you laugh but again its not worth to watch the movie.Movie has copied several scenes from various movies and Farah has tried to put all Masala in the movie for which she is famous for. But unfortunately story don't have the weight to carry this movie. Senseless jokes are not going to make a movie entertaining.Don't watch the movie. That's my verdict. Forget about previous movies of Farah Khan, they were good because of SRK and the direction tips she were getting from Karan Johar. This movie seems good only during the songs.Worst movie of 2010." 
" Not a movie!!!!!!!!","This wasn't a movie it was "the change" in passive sense.it was a bloody slap on the face of Indian cinema entertainment.nothing was of sense ,cant be categorized under any category.was it done just for money making by taking big stars and releasing on Christmas. May god Save the Indian cinema from the bad effects of upcoming nonsense movies Like this. Never watch this movie .... Few stupid things to be noticed: -- -poor jokes, poorly executed action sequences –dialogues full of overacting. –good actors were not able to show their talents due to bad direction and poor script. –promotion was done as if a blockbuster movie was going to be released.A strict law should be made to check the movie's quality before its release, because its just like robbing viewers pocket in a gentle way .." 
" Extremely Awful","Watching Tees Maar Khan was an underwhelming experience. I went in to this movie with mixed expectations. I had high expectations based on Farah Khan's previous efforts - "Main Hoon Naa" and "Om Shanti Om". At the same time I was not fascinated with Shirish Kunder's "Jaan-E-Mann" but this movie is even worse.I was so stupid that i thought this Comedy would be better than the other comedies that were out this year, but i was so wrong once again. Bollywood movies are so much disappointing me, like never before. what is happening. i am so stupid i expected a good movie from the great Farah Khan. the music already wasn't much impressive, considering Vishal Shekar's other 3 movies. Story was very much weak and completely annoying. screenplay was weak. nothing great about this movie anything. disappointing. silly bad movie." 
" One of the most irritating movie of all time","Right from the first scene till the end scene the viewers will ask question to themselves what is going on.plain jokes and it looks like the actors were told to deliver the dialogues by themselves as the director couldn't get the dialog writer. plain jokes, over acting over the top performance from each and every actor even the most serious natural and sober actors like akshaye, sudhir and anjan did over acting in this movie. songs boring, no action scenes. no problem, G3 and phir hera pheri which even AK didn't liked were far better movie and entertaining than TMS. why AK backed this project as producer and why farah khan is continuing movies after the crap MHN and OSO.she will never ever become manmohan desai.even her brother should stop making movies.Advice: don't waste your money and timerating 0.5 out of 10" 
" New scams on rise!!!","I tried to see this movie last night with my wife in a multiplex called PVR Cinemas.I divested Rs. 540/- as ticket charges on the movie. One by one i was getting signals from nature not to see the movie. Like first i did not get enough time to get my favorite sub at Subway, but i thought i'll buy nachos inside PVR. Even inside i didn't get nachos, on top of that i also did not get the sandwich inside PVR. I ignored all these bad signs and went ahead to see this AWFUL, CREEPY, MINDLESS movie.Akshay kumar once knew acting, he may know it now also but the great director Farah Khan is utilizing all her resources to bring the man (Akshay) down by using cheapest of cheapest PJ's in the movie. I wonder who write these, moreover who approves these... Once upon a time she also made a movie known as "Main Hoon Na" which i liked to some extent as it is a light hearted movie, but TMK is not something i expected.I still like akshay as a hero/actor, he has done so many good movies.I beg him not to do movie like these, plz plz plz.Believe me friends you can laugh at least 100000000000 times more by just watching 1 performance of any character in Comedy Circus.( i don't know how many zeor's i added here because of frustration) Please avoid this movie to save yourself from heart attack.Last night i have vowed not to see any forthcoming Farah khan's movie unless and until i get at least 100 out of 100 good reviews.I think this is a scam by which Hindi film industry is trying to make films which ppl will leave before ending (like i got 15 minutes after the interval) and they still have to pay money for the full movie." 
" TMK "I need my money back or I should get rewarded to handle this jigsaw kind of torture"","Just watch "After the Fox (aka Caccia alla volpe released in 1966 US n UK)" it's totally copied from that and therefore no need to say about the movie, more frankly; script needs a super computer to understand and then let others understand that what was happening in it, I live in Mumbai and I admire Akshay Kumar a lot, n believe me this TMK "Sucks"; only stars can't make good movie u need a "script" and here it's all messy, farah should love her husband but don't pamper him by making a bogus movie on his stupid script, this movie is worthless 4 those who have brain and completely made for zombies (brainless), katrina is beautiful but she failed here so as farah's nonsense direction, so don't misguide people because it's their hard earned money and should not be get fooled.... have a great life cya...... advice to farah plz don't direct movies u r making us (indians) look like a fool in front of the international cinema, akshay plz read script b4 u sign anything, katrina u need serious acting lessons don't b a dumb, and to writers plz get a life and stop copying movies from Hollywood, don't ruin Indian cinema... TMK is just awful and a great shame in terms of cinema" 
" Would never suggest this movie to my foes","Don't worry I don't intend to dish out spoilers, giving away the synopsis or plot or even a hint on the story line. The movie opens with Sanjay Dutt narrating the hind sight into the protagonist's current state of affairs. I was wondering why Sanjay Dutt's voice was chosen, my roommate was kind enough to educate me on this choice. To start with Sanjay Dutt's voice is kind of synonymous with the comical negative character (read gangster, thief ...), attributed to the fame of Munna of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. The start to the movie though does not leave a bad taste in the mouth, is not what a comedy flick should begin with.The movie lacks a theme or story line that would inherently support the intended comedy. For most part of the movie it seemed that the actors are trying in desperation to make the audience laugh. For example, a meeting of top cops of Mumbai chaired by the commissioner discusses the possibility (or a lack) of ancient treasures getting stolen. Gibberish is introduced in the form of a participant interrupting the speaker every few seconds. These puns cry for a few laughs at best, and in time become annoying.Akshay Kumar seems to have made a resolve to sink deeper with every new comedy flick; TMK adds value to that resolve. With such frivolous plot, the burden of carrying the movie rested solely on the shoulders of the actors, and they have done a fine job of letting that slip. Katrina Kaif with little or no role in the plot was intentionally brought in for her dancing prowess. I would suggest she take more dance classes before venturing this path again. Moving on to Akshaye Kanna, I'm not sure as to the link between his role and comical intent of the movie. His claim of donning a guest role in this movie is weak, he is present on screen through most of second half. This movie probably will do more damage to his acting career than fix it. The background scores and the songs are definitely not worth mentioning, half the numbers are remixes thus taking away the need for remix artists and DJs. None of the songs are worth humming, even the sticky "Sheila ki Jawani" with its bad hinglish lyrics. The movie sports an occasional burst of a kid shouting "Tees Maar Khan", ruining the few laughs for your money.TMK is bad rip from a 1966 movie "After the fox", which was a fun movie with character. TMK's story line is like evoking laughter by beating below the belt. The script fails to build the lead actor's character and hence does not muster any sort of harmony from the audience; it fails to evoke any kind of sympathy for the lead role as the story line jumps from comical to scary and to serious. The transitions, being abrupt keep the audience guessing the genre of the movie through its length.Half way through the movie the story line, actors, guest actors completely lose direction and wander in different direction. Some sequences either have no bearing on the movie or lack the chaining required in storytelling. The director seems to have lost the purpose when it crosses the half way mark. Many of the obvious realities have been over looked or abandoned to make room for mindless comedy which by the ways fails to make people laugh.A few takeaways from the movie, There are many ways to make the audience laugh; this probably is the worst way. Now that the benchmark for the worst, other would only need to just do incrementally better. This movie is a must watch to expand your scales for rating movies. I have expended time and money in watching this movie, I urge you to watch this movie to make me look less gullible." 
" want to take revenge from your enemy? just tell him to watch this","By making this movie the Bollywood directors-producers had clear this thing that we people are mad and we'll clearly like this BULLSH!T which has made by them...and i think they are right, what we Indian viewers really want is the senseless comedy, item numbers and the great stars like Akki-Salmaan that is why the movies like TMK, No Problem, G-3, Dabangg etc etc are the big hits...this is creating trouble for those viewers who like the off beat films, the directors-producers of India are making these comedy films and in reply they are making the huge profits out of it because of us only, i never wanted to see this movie but my parents insisted me and i was there at the cinema, starting 5 minutes had clearly explained us that this movie will be not easy to handle at all, and yes i was right...script poor, storyline average, acting of the full cast except Akshay Khanna was seriously poor and poor direction...people don't like the movies which need to use mind and this is clearly proved by making such a SH!T...i am angry now, this is the waste of money, time and cast! Sorry if i had hurt anyone's feeling but this is true which i had mention above." 
" Underwhelming experience","Watching Tees Maar Khan was an underwhelming experience. I went in to this movie with mixed expectations. I had high expectations based on Farah Khan's previous efforts - "Main Hoon Naa" and "Om Shanti Om". At the same time I was not fascinated with Shirish Kunder's "Jaan-E-Mann".Tees Maar Khan sets a new low in story telling, narration, poorly conceived characters, direction....the list goes on. The movie revolves around Akshay Kumar playing the title role of a conman who steals antiques by tricking the police. While this seems like enough meat for the story to make a 2-hour movie, however watching the movie proved otherwise. To start with there are not enough sub-plots or situations that highlight the mastery of a con-artist. Perfect example of a movie that highlights this need is "Catch me if you can", where there are multiple sub-plots that highlight the skill of the con-artist. There are not enough twists and turns in the story to keep the viewer interested. In general the narrative does not stick to a focused plot; there are miscellaneous gags, unwanted songs, meaningless sub-plots which only add to the misery of the viewer. All the above can be ignored if this is a movie that is not to be taken seriously. There are examples of movies that thrive on frivolity where twisted humor takes center stage and captures attention of the viewer (Austin Powers, Main Hoon Naa are good examples). But this movie is not funny either. There are a few good one liners and hysterical situations that do tickle the funny bone. But even more irritating are the umpteen attempts in the guise of painful dialogues and gags that are intended for humor, but do not really evoke laughter. Trying to laugh at some of the sequences in this movie is like an aborted sneeze which I want to get out of my system, but cannot.To exacerbate this pathetic movie, there are half baked, loosely defined characters that are acted out by clueless actors. Akshay Kumar tries hard, but has very few opportunities to excel. Akshaye Khanna actually does a good job of playing the role of a self-adulating actor who is obsessed with the idea of winning an Oscar award. But his character is too one dimensional to keep the viewers interested. Katrina Kaif gets the award for playing the role with maximum screen time with minimal relevance to the movie.To summarize.... save your self the time and money this holiday season by giving this movie a skip." 
" Boring, Insufferable, Avoidable","Ever since Dabangg rocked the screens, Bollywood has been racing to come up with the next pure Masala entertainer. Tees Maar Khan promised all this and then some. Alas, the wait just got longer...Before I start on TMK, let me assure you I am a big mas ala movie freak – Wanted, Dabangg, Houseful, Singh is King, you name it I loved them all. Gosh I even liked Chandni Chowk to China! And didn't have too many problems with No Problem either... Tees Maar Khan however is not half as good as even the last two films mentioned. Which is why unabashedly promoting this film by linking it with Dabangg records makes me sad. And angry. More so, as it comes from a director whose last two films (Om Shanti Om and Main Hoon Na) were superb.The problem with Tees Maar Khan is... well, everything! Let me start with the storyline. A master thief who is smarter than everyone get his life's biggest challenge, of robbing a moving train. Not just some small treasure, but the whole train. So he makes a plan by getting a movie star and charading a movie shoot at a village next to the railway line, so that the villagers will stop the train and provide the manpower to take away the loot. Original? Well so it would seem in case you haven't watched the 1966 Peter Sellers' After The Fox. Which, by the way, was among Sellers' forgettable ventures, and is not even pure Hollywood – rather an Italian film. Anyways, our film makers picked up this DVD one fine day and decided to Bollywoodize it, with some item numbers and a mas ala touch. Could have been a cracker, but for that you need a great screenplay and rock solid direction, both of which are sorely missing out here. While watching the film, it seems the director went directly from the basic story-script to the dialogue writer asking for some memorable witty punchlines . You see, we're making a mas ala movie here, and Wanted worked, maybe only because of the dialogues... or is it? So "Ek Bar Maine commitment kar Di..." becomes something like "Tees Maar Khan Ki Zabaan aur..." uff whatever! Then there is the heavily promoted line of "Tawaif Ki Lut ti Izzat Bachana aur Tees Maar Khan Ko Pakadna..." which could really have been a nice memorable line. If only it did not come every 5 minutes in the movie. Now for the acting part. Or whatever passes for it. If you thought SRK hams, wait till you see Akki in this one. It is so over the top that a few minutes into the film you feel whether Farah Khan directed the movie, or was she busy tending to her triplets at home. Never expected Katrina to 'act' so it is not a let down at all. But Akshaye Khanna was fine. Not a great performance, which we expect of him, but given everyone else around this definitely deserved an Oscar!!! ;-) However, both he and Kat do not have much footage, and neither do the others. Why not? Read on...Okay so whats good? Need I tell anyone that Shiela Ki Jawani is one cool item song? Or that Wallah re Wallah has Salman dancing in pure Munni Badnaam Hui style. But what is even better is that if you are going to the theatre for these two, then you might as well come out in the first 45 minutes, once these songs are over. Yes, the director does not make us wait too long. And do watch out for the Sallu-Kat chemistry in the second song. Another saving grace is the editing. The poor screenplay and pathetic performances largely are subdued by crisp and fast editing which make you not realise the absurd crap you're watching. At least not till the last half hour of the movie when the editor probably fell asleep. Cant blame him, except for the fact that this guy is also credited with the story and screenplay too (Yeah they probably didn't realise too many people would have seen a 1966 Italian film dubbed into English) Considering the film is barely above 2 hours, cut out another half hour of songs, credits, etc you are left with an hour of complete nonsense partly saved by the editor. Although this chopping off large portions of footage probably consisted of everyone in the cast except for Akki's scene. Which mean unbridled loud acting – even by his standards. The inspiration of keeping the film short probably came from Dabangg. Good thought, but crisp editing is like a Tadka. Out here the Daal is missing. And rotten." 
" A waste of Rs.150 and three hours","The movie not only disappoints but makes you want to leave the theater in less than 5 minutes. Bad acting by almost everyone, no story plot gives one a headache. A waste of Rs.150 and three hours. Totally avoidable. Farah Khan has done a terrible job at directing, dialogs and choreography. Waste of acting prowess of Akshay- Kumar & Khanna. Although the only role that is well cast is for Katrina- that of an amateur actresses and she plays that well, since she cannot act to save her life. Bad Choreography. Bad Acting. Bad story. Bad Dialogs. Bad Screenplay. The movie leaves nothing to look forward to after the first 5 minutes." 
" Horrible Movie!","The movie is so bad that I had a terrible headache for hours after watching it! It's a disgrace to modern Bollywood cinema! Bad acting, really bad story, and super-bad dialogue(s)! I'm so disappointed and angry that I wasted my time and money to see this flop show!The storyline has way too many gaps. The constant nagging chorus of screaming the movie name over and over is super annoying! The film locations are cheesy at best. I can't believe Farah Khan will deliver such a dud, after entertaining movies like 'Om Shanti Om' and 'Main Hoon Na'. I guess what people have been saying is right.. Farah cannot deliver a movie without Shah Rukh Khan. It's a relief to see that SRK is not part of this movie!! Thank you, SRK!Watch it at your own risk!"
