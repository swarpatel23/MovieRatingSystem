" A playful, knowing, kitsch film about self-mythology and the power of Bollywood fantasy","I saw Jhoom Barabar Jhoom while travelling in Rajasthan, in the Raj Mundir in Jaipur, which is, with some justification, described as the best cinema in Asia (and it certainly beats watching a film in a 'Multiplex' on a screen the size of a large TV in London).As the film ended and the huge audience of all ages rose, making its way into the grand, pretty foyer, I turned to an Indian man in his thirties next to me and asked him in Hindi if he liked it. He said he loved the songs, particularly the song of the title, which he thought would get even the most unlikely person in the cinema dancing in the aisles. Then he added,'But the the rest of the film is nonsense'.I certainly agree with him about the infectious song of the title, having badly hummed it often. However, I don't think the rest of the film is nonsense. What I believe many people mistake for nonsense is actually a playful, kitsch, knowingly referential film revolving around the desires and problems of self-mythology, and the power of Bollywood fantasy. The film is set in Waterloo station where a young Indian man and woman of Pakistani origin bump into each other and form an acquaintance while waiting for infamously late English trains. But their talk about themselves, we come to see, may not quite be so credible and ingenuous. Not only this but there is something magical in the air at Waterloo Station, for a wondering busker, Amitabh Bachan, looking like a sixties drop out, is somehow mysteriously involved in the lively plot.The two leads, Bachan's son Abishek, and Preity Zinta, make engaging leads and, alongside the wonderfully outrageous Laura Dutta and Bobby Deol handle the film's sense of fun and comedy vigorously (though perhaps the nods to the famous Bachan/Deol partnership in Sholay goes too far).Another thing about Jhoon Barabar Jhoon is its sure sense of place, something few Indian films set in Britain can claim. Preity Zinta's Alvira is an NRI and the film makes a playful but genuine attempt to engage with the London Indian diaspora." 
" JBJ is a wild, fun, and mad crazy ride!","I loved Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. I'm from the UK. But I saw the film at an almost packed theater here in the USA. The majority of the audience laughed, cheered, and had a great time. The film had some wonderful humour, dancing, and Bollywood references. Almost nothing was off limits to poke fun at. Abhishek Bachchan was the engine of the film. Abhishek has turned in a very solid performance as Rikki.He is really turning into a very talented and versatile actor. Guru and JBJ work as he leads both films well. Preity Zinta and Lara Dutta are both gorgeous, spunky, and funny as hell. Even Bobby Deol is very good in the second half of the film. My only complaint is that the film was a bit slow in the start. But that is about it. JBJ is a fun and entertaining way to spend a weekend at the cinema!" 
" A "Must-not" See","My 2 cents: This movie was highly recommended to me by a friend. He "sms'd" me the previous night and told me that it was an awesome movie... something that I should see the very next day. Taking his advice, another friend and I bought tickets at a "premium charge" (being newly released and all). Halfway through the movie, I wanted to tear my arm out and beat myself to death with it. The movie has an abysmal storyline. The intended "plot-twist" most moviegoers can predict when they are 30 mins into the movie. We stayed back after the intermission coz after all, a movie cannot be _that_ lame and boring.... Well, to our horror, it actually was. So USPs of the movie: 1) Lara Dutta looks hot 2) Nice song (only one... but after the 100 billionth repetition, it actually becomes really irritating) 3) Big B in a cool outfit.Why you should not see this movie: 1) Extremely boring and slow. 2) Very lame jokes - courtesy small B. (Ash's man-toy) 3) Predictable storyline. 4) Big B needs to buy a ticket to Pluto and come back after a gazillion years... somebody needs to tell him about something called "OVER-EXPOSURE".Conclusion: DO NOT SEE!" 
" Dance Bolly Dance !","Bollywood certainly at it's nearly-best, DANCE BABY DANCE delivers in ways both standard and special. Even though we've seen these handsome & curvy thesps in other top Bollywood productions, all deliver broad but colorful performances.Acting, music, singing, & choreography seem classically Bollywood - all of it sweetly proportioned to the generous talents involved. Wonderful location shooting predominates, especially pulsing Paris and lovely London - a nice change-up from the usual Mumbai sound-stages.Whimsical story rarely if ever takes a dark turn; light & frothy predominates, built around common theme of romantic sleight-of-hands. The exuberance is festive throughout, with poignancy never far away.Special kudos to always reliable Bachchan, who plays a kind of MC or host to the giddy romantic roundelay.This is the kind of superb Bollywood fantasia that really merits a theatrical viewing....although with limited distribution DVD-on-your-Plasma is next best thing!" 
" Totally mindless. What Fun...!!","What generally works as the weakness of a film is the strength of this one. The film has a week storyline, virtually non-existent script and no logic. But that's where the fun lies.Abhishek Bachchan and Preity Zinta are introduced in very beginning of the film who from there carry forward a total mindless and fun filled sequence of events. Events that are funny (sometimes very funny), romantic, sometimes emotional but never real. The narration is unique and keeps you interested for most of the time. The strongest part of the film is its music. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have created sheer magic with their instruments. Each song is masterpiece. And with modern day sound technology (watch it in a Doolby Digital theater) you would actually want to dance especially on the 3rd version of the title track.Actors have performed well. Everyone has pulled the comic timing very well. Amitabh Bachchan keeps appearing in between with fabulous attire and equally good song to keep the zing intact.The punch line of the film says it all... Jump, Dance, Shout... But don't expect anything more. Entertainment is only thing that this has to offer. No matter with what mood you enter the theater, more likely than not chance are you'll come out smiling. And isn't that smile worth all the money you spent on that ticket. It certainly is." 
" Utter Rubbish","I have never seen worst movie then this. Waste of time, energy and of course money. Why do people make such movies just for petty gains by robbing millions of anticipating audience. The crew involved in making the film and star-cast should be punished to watch the movie 10 times and I'm sure they'll also become unconscious.All the stars have been wasted of their potential, no screenplay, poor direction and confusing all the way. Cinematography is good, nothing much to say about choreography, title track is good but when it appears in movie 5 times, you loose the interest from that also..What is the need for Amitabh to play a joker ? So, don't waste your weekend watching this movie, instead take your family to some garden, museum, restaurant or even zoo is better. However, if still you want to see zoo of human beings this movie is for you. I have wasted my Saturday evening watching it and me and my wife continue to repent even today morning." 
" In Defense of a Great Film!","I'm sad that so many of the comments here bash this movie. I thought it was great! One of the best films of this year.You really have to see this movie with a grain of salt. If you understand that this is supposed to be a fun movie where the actors are just having a lot of fun, you'll love it.The plot is right, and well scripted. The movie runs smoothly, and doesn't seem to last the time it actually is. I was left wanting more.The actors are amazing. Abhishek Bacchan is terrific in his role as Rikki Tukhral. Preity Zinta and Bobby Deol do a fine job, but hats off to Lara Dutta who is amazing as both Anaida and Laila. As Anaida, she portrays the vulnerability and her Indian-French accent is very believable. Her turn as Laila is awesome. The contrast is terrific! The songs are well visualized, and the costumes are fun and fabulous.I have to say that this is a great movie, and it should have gotten better reviews." 
" Disappointing movie!!!","I read in an Abhishek interview that when he was initially presented with the JBJ story idea (while shooting Bunty babli) it was set in a Delhi train station platform......i can just about imagine the charming scene. Abhishek and his heroine chatting over a cup of chai next to the tea stall. How did that potentially charming romantic tale turn into this over the top Bollywood film based in London? Jhoom Barabar Jhoom was an utter disappointment to me considering the same banner and director came out with the thoroughly entertaining Bunty Aur Babli. The movie felt like a 2hr long music video/ fashion show. I felt the person who would get the most mileage out of the movie would be the fashion designer/stylist of the movie which had a lot of outlandish costumes none more so than the attire of the Big B in the title song.The first half felt awkward although there were a few funny moments thanks to the Lara and Abhishek. The movie picks up in the 2nd half but it was more due to the performances of the actors rather than the progression of the story. The actors did a relatively good job considering the weak script. I felt Lara Dutta and Bobby Deol were the standout performers from the movie as they had the opportunity to portray characters that had different shades to it. Lara was especially cute with the French accent and the potty mouth of the 2nd half. Bobby had some excellent comic moments in the 2nd half. Abhishek took a bit of a risk by playing such a loud character...he does go a bit over the top at times but I still think he is a good actor and he has his moments. For me Preity Zinta has been repeating herself in all her movies recently (except maybe Lakshya)...ever since Kal Ho Na Ho, she seems to be playing the same character over and over again i.e. an Indian who is either born and brought up abroad or living abroad. She too improves only in the 2nd half when she is not trying to put on an accent. There was not enough chemistry between the lead pair although you could see that they are buddies.The music was excellent although Shaad Ali managed to drag all life out of the catchy title song since it pops up all over the film. The slow romantic number was also good.I feel that Yash Raj films are catering more to the NRI crowd with their movies and subsequently took the soul out of this movie by presenting on this enormous scale.. you cant really blame them as it is a business and they need to recoup their costs.The film has its moments but it is in no way anything more than an average product." 
" Jhoom machale (Sarcasm)","It simply has to be the worst movie of 2007 because it was complete lame about two strangers Abhishek & Preity met in a train station and told each other that they are already engaged, then they told their story when they first met. In Abhishek's story he got a ticket to Hollywood but Lara look it from him and he was singing & dancing to get it back. When he got it he kissed Lara in front of the Eiffel tower which was lighting up and threw the ticket away (Crap, Crap, Crap, & Mega Crap!). In Preity's story she was in Madame Tussaud's and a lawyer (Bobby) saved her from a Superman statue falling above her and they fell in love. Preity wanted to sue the owner of Madame Tussaud's and Bobby was fighting her case but all of a sudden the judge started singing like a squirrel and they started dancing & singing the Kiss of Love song. The lyrics of the Kiss of Love song should be changed to "Stupid film, Stupid film, Stay away from the stupid film". Music is not that great as many people are saying the only good song is the very first "Jhoom" and the rest of them do not jar and lacks instant recall after one hearing. There are a few surprises but they were so predictable that you didn't even have to be of average intelligence to figure them out. Amitabh's get-up was good with his long hair and hat with feathers but it didn't make the film any better. Watching three hours of your washing machine spin would be more rewarding than this!" 
" Disappointing, even Preity Zinta disappoints.","I love Bollywood films. Ravishing, well-invested musicals, song and dance, dialogues which are larger than life, wonderful actors, strong characters. The song numbers have been an artistic tradition Hindi films, and what particularly amazes me about all these films is the complete irrelevance of the song numbers to the film's story itself (unless it's a film like Dil To Pagal Hai, where the music is part of the script).I think Jhoom Barabar Jhoom is a brave attempt to make a film with the songs being part of the screenplay. But even then, it just doesn't work. Why? Because there is NO screenplay. The entire film is a big dance show. And it shouldn't be like this. When there are no songs, the film consists of silly jokes and plastic "acting". Some sequences are so ridiculous that you start hating anyone who's been ever involved with this film. It is intended to be funny and crazy, which is a good purpose, but this film manages to be neither this nor that and instead, it sadly ends up being a big silly show. I do admit that the songs are well danced and catchy, but they become tiresome at some point, mainly because most of them are actually the same song in different versions.The acting (not that it can be called acting in this case) is bad. Abhishek is annoying and miscast. Pretentious performance. Preity, an actress I like immensely, is her usual bubbly and vivacious self, but here, somehow lifeless. The fact that a great actress like Preity could even think of appearing in this film makes me want to slap her. Bobby and Lara are terrible. They ham, overact, and even in the dance numbers get overshadowed by the leading stars (at least here they make some sense). Lara is particularly horrible as a prostitute with her fake French accent. All in all, I do recommend to watch it if you intend to go and dance through the entire film. Quite a special watch buhaaaa..." 
" Gloriously Entertaining, Smart, Sleek, Sophisticated, Fun!!","Jhoom Barabar Jhoom is a wonderful, eye-candy treat -- beautifully staged and filmed, full of snappy dialogue, an intriguing round-about plot with unexpected twists and turns, and tongue-in-cheek humor (such as a spoken reference to the London wax museum images of Amitji and Ashji --his real-life father and wife -- by Abhishek). Lots of action, but no guns, no slaps, no fights, no gore -- finally!! - Amitabh has a great recurring performance in this film, beautifully and memorably decked out as a composite Willie Nelson/vagabond/gypsy/hippie guitar player in his fringy coat-of-many-colors, complete with jewelry and feathers, entertaining the travelers at the train station while making musical observations on the romantic plot evolving between Abhishek and Preity, in two of their best performances to date. Lara and Bobby were also great in their supporting roles, playing polar opposite characters from the first to last half of the film. The musical numbers and dancing were also superb. If you love Indian cinema, you don't want to miss this one; it's worthy of many viewings! A+++!" 
" Mad Wild Crazy Fun !!!!","OK. Picture this What if. Zaara from 'Veer Zaara was living in present day London and met Bunty from 'Bunty aur Babli' and both of them started talking about their love lives.Sounds whacky !!!! Hmmm???? What if their love stories (flashbacks) took you through events such as Princess Diana's funeral and places like Madame Tussauds wax museum and a mad song and dance sequence at none other than Eiffel Tower!!!!Sounds Over The Top ????Wait that is just the first half !!!!What if. After discussing their respective fairy tale romances they ponder upon what would have happened had they not met their 'FiancÈes' and met as two single people. And this dream sequence took you to what can only be described as the director's tribute to Yash Chopra's Veer Zaara .WHOA!!!! HANG ON HANG ON. You thought the first half was Over The Top????Then the second half is 'OVER whatever you can BLOODY IMAGINE'So what do I think about Shaad Ali's third directorial venture !!!!IT BLEW MY MIND AWAY.JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM ROCKS BABY !!!!Because somewhere between the 'Over The Top' phase and 'Over the Bloody Everything' phase I realized that this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously or logically or practically. That's just not what its asking of its audience. Its like one of those wild rides you hop on in an amusement park and just let yourself go crazy not knowing what to do when every moment is a new surprising experience.Is it one of the best films I've ever seen . NO Is it one of the best screenplays ever written.NOBut it's genuinely one of the bravest and sincere attempts I've seen of a film that redefines mainstream Hindi cinema. Its in true terms a refreshingly different piece of entertainment.Yeah Yeahthe 'Nay sayers' can go ahead and sue me for using the (oh so criminal) word 'DIFFERENT' for a (OH MY GAWD!!!!) Yashraj Film's production.The major flaw of the film is the sluggish pace of the first half. The film has a running time of a little over 2 hours, yet it seems to have some scope for a bit of trimming in the initial reels. The song 'Ticket to Hollywood', no matter how foot tapping and well choreographed seems unnecessary and could have been done without. All the other songs have been interestingly shot as well, may it be 'Kiss of Love'  the film's tribute to the Oscar winning Richard Gere starrer 'Chicago' or Bol Na Halke'  an ode to 'Veer Zaara' perhaps : /Director Shaad Ali has a flare for comedy and that comes across effectively in the film. JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM is as MAD and CRAZY as nothing else I've seen in a long time. It makes the director's last film Bunty aur Babli look like a serious art film. SERIOUSLY !!!!J But its not a LOUD film. Yes I am aware the above two statements sound contradictory but you'd understand what I mean when you watch the film.Also, Mr. Shaad does a fine job of extracting some 'real life' moments and making them fit seamlessly into the film which is as close to reality as Taj Mahal is from Eiffel Tower.Performances by Abhishek Bachchan and Lara Dutta ( in whatever little role she has) are brilliant. Specially Lara Dutta, who stuns you with her most polished performance to date. She works the audience brilliantly in her two different 'avatars' in the film.. Hang in there Ms. Dutta, you'll get your due very soon as you clearly deserve every ounce of it.Bobby Deol gets a similar opportunity in the film where he gets two diametrically opposite personas to potray and he does a decent job. He manages to look like a hot and suave Indo-Brit lawyer and then a silly Punjabi mama's boy with amazing finesse.Director Shaad Ali has a flare for comedy and that comes across effectively in the film.

Would it appeal to the masses or would they find the 'hollywood-ish' first half too iffy !!!! I don't know the answer to these questions. What I DO know, is that due to the fantastic marketing and immense pre-release popularity of its music, it will get a good opening at the domestic and international box office. So the crux of the situation is....Meaningful cinema it isn't. But then it never pretends to be so. Just watch it and enjoy the sillinessMy verdict :- PAISA VASOOL-Popcorn Included !!!! :)" 
" Caught up in their own hype!!!","Yashraj Films know they have a set audience that will turn up and watch whatever they put in the cinemas. I've never known such loyalty towards a production house.But JBJ will be a massive wake up call for all concerned. The film has its good moments and some worthy performances. But the overall product is nothing short of being a complete disaster. Fair enough the Director may have thought that he has come up with an ingenious idea, but sometimes certain ideas or thoughts are far better off staying within the confines of ones head, as they sound and look a lot better swirling around 'up there' than on a large screen.The protagonists (Abhishek Bachchan and Priety Zinta) look unconvinced by their characters and the whole scenario. And despite Abhishek's best efforts, you almost end up hating both the main characters, purely because the film has bored you senseless by the time proceedings really begin. And by this I mean the introduction of the other two main characters (Bobby Deol and Lara Dutta) - this time in person rather than in the imaginary world of AB and PZ.Bobby Deol does a very good job considering that he is offered very little in the way of screen time. He plays both his characters very well, in particular the mummy's boy. Lara Dutta is amazing and really puts Priety Zinta in the shade with her performance. Despite both BD and LD having peripheral parts in the film - they both, in my eyes, walk away with the honours as the most entertaining pair on screen.Amitabh Bachchan is wasted and only appears every time they need to break the monotony of the main characters. He also appears in the dance competition to lend his support to a rather over long sequence.Overall, JBJ offers very little in the way of a storyline. The treatment of the subject is what you expect of Yashraj films. But even they couldn't dress this weak subject up. DVD rental material at the most." 
" Bad Bad Bad","Yet another all style no substance drama ( err no drama too). A film that has many music videos but no story or screenplay. Big stars, Short skirts, high boots, fashionable jackets, expensive glares, London/ Paris streets, but ZERO content. When Shaad Ali makes a Sathiya in simple homely locations, its delectable. Why, then, do you want to go abroad and increase the tourism of those countries? I feel when one has no story, you can not cover up with extravaganza.Abhishek still can not act. Preity is the same. Bobby and Lara are wasted, though they act better than these two. Amitabh is trying to make a statement with his hideous attire. And the audiences are being fooled by the promos.JBJ is yet another disappointment in the name of progressive Indian cinema. It's light years away from Hollywood." 
" No, not anymore!","I am so depressed. What the heck was that all about? Jhoom Babarbar Jhoom is a topper. It has made it all the way to number 1 in my list of "Movies I hate the most" overtaking the place of Yashraj's previous release Dhoom 2. What is the fuss all about? Who wants to sing, shout and dance with actors performing their most idiotic characters ever. There is no way anyone in any way can relate to this movie. Great sets, great locales, great actors - yet JBJ is a loser in every sense. If this is how Indian cinema is going global then it must stop, immediately.Director Shaad Ali leaves everybody disappointed. His earlier movie Bunty aur Babli rocked the nation. He approached Jhoom.. is almost similar retrospective manner. Unfortunately, it does not work out this time because there is nothing Jhoom.. can be considered as decent cinema. Rikky and Alvira meet, erect a heap of lies, an idiotic nomad (Monsieur Amitabh Bachchan, the Great!) appears out of nowhere and does almost nothing, now the two are making up stories to conceal their lies and bingo - guess what, they're in love.Why, why do they have to do it? They call it a rom-com, but let me tell you - it's neither romantic nor comic. It's not a movie that fits into comedy genre neither does it happen to be a love story (no, don't call it a love story. Idiots don't fall in love.) If there is anything in the movie, then it's the lush cinematography, great editing works, that breathtaking 360-degree rotated view of Taj Mahal, the dance sequence in front of the Eiffel Tower, the Superman falling sequence at Madame Taussad, Lara Dutta's French accent + the swearing and everything, and Preity Zinta (her Brit accent does not seem to work out for me.) Abhishek Bachchan needs to seriously think about his selection of roles and Bobby Doel, welcome back. A lot has changed while you were gone. They don't make those good movies anymore. But Bobby looks good, both as the hunk and the geek.Kudos to Vaibhavi Merchant - she is the only person who does justice to her work. Shankar Ehsaan Loy fail to impress (Ticket to Hollywood.. is too Rahman style!) Gulzar is caught up with a bunch of people who don't know what they're doing. The casting director seems to have accomplished a hectic job. And finally Yashraj! (sigh) Least spoken is best. They're making money and that's good, perhaps they know Jhoom Barabar Jhoom is the substance that sells. And if films like Jhoom.. continue to sell, then Indian cinema wouldn't be very proud as the world's largest film industry." 
" 1 of my top 3 movies this year","To put my review in context I should probably stress the fact that I am a white British female with a love of musicals and romantic comedies. This was my first ever Bollywood film (having had my interest stirred when the IIFA came to Yorkshire) and I adored every minute. So much so I have now seen it 3 times.I am sure that there are probably better acted, more dramatic, more credible Bollywood movies. But for pure pleasure and enjoyment this was a revelation.I found the leads very likable indeed. Apologies to anyone who thinks they were 1 dimensional, to me they were just good fun.The dance sequences were spectacular, better than anything I've seen Hollywood offer in many a year. Amitabh Bachan's intermittent appearances singing the title track were delightful and JBJ the song is so catchy I've been singing it ever since.In short, if you enjoy a light comedy with excellent singing and dancing routines and some OTT cheesy romance then you'll probably enjoy this as much as I did."
