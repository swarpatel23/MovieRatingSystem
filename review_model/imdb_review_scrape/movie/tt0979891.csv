" An average entertainer","I saw this movie on TV as i thought it might be good seeing Nana's acting and paresh's acting ; i kept seeing the movie but i thought the scenes between kunal and reema should have been well adjusted it seems as if they don't have any as much importance in the story , also it is hard to understand why is Nana patekars character so angry on Cricket! . But I think Paresh's story was at least better amongst the three and that of Nana seemed to Catch munnabhai mbbs effect though not successful.And why do they always show the sufferings Indians have to go in U.K c'mon get some another plot like why not go to U.S or Pakistan etc.I will give this movie 6/10 as i thought it was at least better than remaining movies running on TV"
