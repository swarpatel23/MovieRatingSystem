" Very well made movie","Technically superb. The actors carry their characters well. Gripping narrative though the dialogues could have been a little simpler.This movie shows the undercurrent of India's freedom struggle in the context of V.D.Savarkar's life and work. Shailendra Gaud has done a fantastic job in depicting the leader's ambitions and personal struggles. A Hindi movie with no song-and-dance sequence (except for a background rendition of Savarkar's Ode To Motherland,) it breaks from the beaten path both in terms of content and form. The end is abrupt and does not depict the more controversial facts around the Godse Trial of 1948 and his last 20 years. Also missing are more references to his prolific writings and compositions.Definitely a must-see for anyone even remotely interested in Indian history and current affairs."
